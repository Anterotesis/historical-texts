            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>VVHen the sins of this Kingdom were ripe for punishment, the Divine Justice permitted a great part of it to be besotted with Discontents either wholly causeless, or such as His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty was pleased to remedy with Grants so unmeasurably gracious, as could not otherwise be justified than by their importunity that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, and His Majesties Royall ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness of his Subjects peace and safety.</p>
                  <p>These Grants were so far from satisfying those, whose broken fortunes and boundless de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires would not permit them to live without a Civil War, that they make of them no other use than thereby to strengthen themselves to demand more: till at last they broke out into a most unnatural <hi>Rebellion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The people alwaies apt to cherish murmurs and invectives against their Princes,
<pb facs="tcp:103099:3"/>
and now grown wanton with the fruits of a long peace, incline to <hi>Abners</hi> mind, and think the war (which yet they knew not) but a sport. Therefore with a great facility they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the design: and the baits to cover the Hooks with, are <hi>the preservation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and <hi>the vindication of Liberty.</hi> And howsoever they cannot reconcile their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise with Gods command, which under <hi>pain of damnation forbids all Subjects to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist their King:</hi> yet they are so wedded to that interest which they challenge in <hi>Religion,</hi> and Liberty, that for Gods command, if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not untie the Knot, they resolve to cut it. Do but assure them that the forbidden fruit will make them as Gods, and they will eat it though it be forbidden: do but perswade them that to take up arms against their Sovereign is the way to secure their <hi>Religion</hi> and Liberty, and they make bold with God for once to choose their own way for so good an end.</p>
                  <p>From so desperate Resolution, had they had but Morall justice, they might have been kept back by the improbability of those calumnies
<pb facs="tcp:103099:3"/>
whereby His Majesty was traduced, as intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to alter <hi>Religion</hi> and infringe their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.</p>
                  <p>Or had <hi>Religion</hi> (to which they do so Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously pretend) had that potent influence upon them, it might have taught them, <hi>that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion cannot be defended by transgressing Gods commands, which are the Rule of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if nothing else, yet even regard to their own pretensions, the defence of <hi>Religion</hi> and Liberty, should have wrought in them a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> which is so contrary to both.</p>
                  <p>For as an eye had to Gods dominion over us should exact obedience to his commands, though never so much to our prejudice: So the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his infinite goodness ought to win it from us, because his commands enjoyn us onely what is for our good, if we could see it.</p>
                  <p>He would not have forbidden Subjects to defend <hi>Religion</hi> against their King by force of Arms, but that he knew as Rebels can be no friends to Religion, so it gaines love and admiration by the innocent patience of
<pb facs="tcp:103099:4"/>
those that profess it; whereas <hi>Bloodshed, Force,</hi> and <hi>Rapine,</hi> (the fruits of <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi>) procure <hi>Hatred</hi> or <hi>Hypocrisie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for <hi>Liberty,</hi> it is for the good of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to forbid the assertion of it by Subjects Arms taken up against their Prince: both because that pretence would otherwise be used by those that have a design to make the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed people their own slaves, and because Rebellion doth more violate the Subjects li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, than is morally possible for the worst Prince in times of peace to do.</p>
                  <p>This truth was known before by speculation to a few, whose endeavours to infuse it into the distempered peoples minds, had the fate of <hi>Cassandraes</hi> predictions, <hi>to hit the truth and want belief,</hi> till these sad times have at last verified it by a costly experience.</p>
                  <p>That this may be more universally benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial; you have too plentifull a harvest of Instances collected in the insuing Relations: wherein may evidently be seen, that this War which the multitude was so fond of, as the only means to preserve <hi>Religion</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:103099:4"/>
and <hi>Liberty,</hi> hath been almost the utter ruin of them both.</p>
                  <p>Here you shall find these great pretenders to <hi>Religion,</hi> suppressing that which themselves confess to be Divine Truth, Debarring poor prisoners the comfort of joyning their prayers together, enforcing men to take Oaths of blind Obedience to whatsoever they should afterwards command them; turning out Clergy-men above all exception, and placing most scandalous and insufficient wretches in their rooms, dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from their invenomed mouths most horrid Blasphemies against our blessed Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, abusing the service of God, and profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning not only the Form of it, the Book of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer,</hi> (against which they have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed quarrel) but even Gods own Word, the <hi>holy Bible,</hi> which they pretend to reverence.</p>
                  <p>Here shall you behold them not only (like those <hi>Canes Sepulchrales</hi>) violating the bones and ashes of the dead, to make the world know that they believe what some of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows openly profess, that of those sometime living <hi>Temples</hi> of the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> there
<pb facs="tcp:103099:5"/>
shall be no resurrection, but exercising their fury on the Churches of God; which they have defaced with Barbarous rudeness, defiled with more than beastly nastiness, and (as if contrary to their wont they had studied the <hi>Book of Maccabees</hi> to find out and out-do the most Heathenish wickednesses therein rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they have polluted the very <hi>Altar</hi> with their whoredoms.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Independents</hi> (at whose door the most part of these profanations of the Houses of God must lye) will hardly make the world believe they are in earnest when they plead for Liberty of Conscience in <hi>Religion,</hi> while they thus deface the places where it should be taught and practiced.</p>
                  <p>And as ill can the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> make good their pretended zeal to <hi>Religion,</hi> and the Nurse of it, <hi>Learning,</hi> having almost extirpated one of the most flourishing Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of Christendom.</p>
                  <p>Then for the other point, the Subjects Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, the following Narrations will plainly shew that it hath not been spared by those that
<pb facs="tcp:103099:5"/>
would be accounted the Champions of it, when the violation of it might satisfie either their <hi>Lust,</hi> their <hi>Covetousness,</hi> or their <hi>Cruelty.</hi>

                  <p>Their <hi>Lust</hi> hath prompted them not only to threaten Rape, but with violence to attempt it, and to wound and murther those upon whom they could not effect their beastly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
                  <p>To satisfy their <hi>Covetousness,</hi> they have unmercifully robbed of their fortunes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the extremest want, not only those that were their opposites and able to hurt them, but those whose sex, age and condition might have melted stones into pitty, women, children, the sick, the aged, women in labour, and even those of their own party.</p>
                  <p>Their <hi>Cruelty</hi> hath not contented it self with the murther of those they hated, but as if they had been the professed Schollars of that inhumane monster, whose Maxim was, <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat Tyrannus lenis, in regno meo mors impetratur,</hi> they have insulted over the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and lives of their fellow Subjects with
<pb facs="tcp:103099:6"/>
most exquisite Tortures, whipt some to Death, and starved others: they have made it a Crime in some that they were neighbours to those whom they persecuted for their Loyalty, and punished others for shewing them mercy: nay to shew that their ambition was to choose out the sharpest executioners of their Tyranny (though with the hazard of rendring the names of Christians odious for their sakes to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed enemies of Christendom) they had once designed divers of prime worth and quality both of the Clergy and the Gentry to be sold for slaves to their brethren the <hi>Turks</hi> at <hi>Argiers.</hi> And so full of contagious venome is their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, that it hath made Parents unnatural to their own children, suffering them to perish by Famine because they refused to Rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Sovereign.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, their malice hath so far transcended all bounds, that they have done mischief where they were not invited by any benefit to themselves or any other, only for the delight they took in doing it, burning houses, spoyling goods, destroying Books, Evidences,
<pb facs="tcp:103099:6"/>
and Publick Records, to the prejudice of Posterity, the disturbance of Possessions, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Justice, and the impairing of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, only to make themselves Sport: they have by breaking Articles of surrender, by offering savage force to the persons of messengers for Treaty, and to the goods and houses of foreign <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> broken the Sacred Laws and disturbed the Commerce of Nations: and that nothing might be wanting to the height of their villanies, by the rude defacing of the Pictures and resemblances of His Majesty their Sovereign, they have declared their wicked intentions against his Sacred Person.</p>
                  <p>Now if any shall indeavour to acquit the Grandees of the Faction by laying all the fault on private men or inferiour Officers; and shall averr that if complaint had been made to the Parliament, redress would have been given: let them know that by reading this Book it will appear that the bad success which wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed persons found, is a sufficient evidence that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers should have lost their labour in complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For even their Justice was so obstructed
<pb facs="tcp:103099:7"/>
by that Faction that the best remedy of the foulest injuries was but <hi>Eli</hi> his correction of his sons, a cold admonition: and sometimes a direct denial of Justice, yea and the goods of the sufferers, given as a reward to those that did the wrong.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore since our imagined Sickness hath led us into a needless course of Physick, wherein we have almost purged and bled to death; if we love our own safety better than the gain of those that live upon our ruins, let us at last be wise, and give over the Physitian.</p>
                  <p>In a word, we shall promise in the sight of God, and remembring that Lyers are in the number of those against whom the gates of the new <hi>Jerusalem</hi> shall be shut, to deal in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing stories with all candor and ingenuity, not out of a desire to render the actors of these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties odious, or abuse the Reader either with falsehoods or uncertainties, but to report no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what hath been examined and atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by men of known truth and integrity: And that the world may see what violent affections these Sectaries brought to these hostile Acts, we

                  <p>ON <hi>Monday, Aug.</hi> 22. 1642. Sir <hi>John Lucas</hi> intended with some Horse and Arms, to begin his Journey towards the North, to wait upon the King; which purpose of his being on <hi>Saturday</hi> by a treacherous Servant discovered to <hi>John Langley</hi> of <hi>Colchester,</hi> Grocer, and Captain of the Trained Bands; He, with <hi>Henry Barrington,</hi> Brewer, and Alderman of the Town, spent the next day, being <hi>Sunday,</hi> in riding to <hi>Coggeshall, Bock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Bayntree, Halsteed,</hi> and other Towns of their own Faction, to communicate to them the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of it, and invite them with strong guards of Muskets, to beset the ways and intercept him in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103099:9"/>
his Journey, and did also (by the assistance of the Mayor) set a guard of <hi>Colchester</hi> Trainband, on <hi>Sunday</hi> night about his house. Sir <hi>John Lucas</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to begin his journey early by one or two a clock on <hi>Monday</hi> morning, supposing he might so pass mith most privacy and no opposition, but the back gate at which he thought to issue out was no sooner opened, but a strong guard from under a hedge present themselves, and one of them dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Musket as a Warning-piece to the Town, where the Alarm is presently taken, the Drum strook up, and the whole Town raised, the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers (of which there were 400 or 500 then in Town gathered to serve under the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> and Lord <hi>Say</hi>) brought up the Beacon, by direction of <hi>Dan. Cole</hi> Alderman, fired, and Horsemen into all parts sent forth to call in the Country against the Cavaliers in Sir <hi>John Lucas</hi>'s house.</p>
                  <p>The house is presently beset with at least 2000 people, and two pieces of Ordnance are brought to make a Battery; at last they rushed into the house, and the first man they seize upon is Mr. <hi>Newcomin,</hi> Parson of S. <hi>Trinity</hi> Parish in <hi>Colchester</hi>; they tear his cloaths off his back, beat him with their Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Halberts, and with infinite exclamations, carry him in triumph through the chief streets of the Town; by the way entring into a wild but very serious consideration, not whether he should dye (for that they had resolved at first) but to what death to put him; one votes drowning, another ston<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, another bids beat out his braines. At length hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing consulted with Alderman <hi>Cole,</hi> they carry him to the common Goal, commanding the Jaylor to put him in the strong hold, (a place provided for the most desperate Malefactors) affirming they would soon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103099:9"/>
return to take further order with him. There he remained till one a clock, being then removed to another Chamber. They now return to their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows who were searching Sir <hi>John Lucas</hi>'s house, some twenty of them rush'd into the Ladies Chamber, laid hands upon her, set a sword to her breast, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring her to tell where the Arms and Cavaliers were. The Horse and Arms are soon found and seized on by the Mayor, who sends the Arms to the Town-Hall, the Horse to an Inn to be there kept on Sir <hi>John Lucas</hi>'s cost, till they could be sent to the Parliament. The People lay hands on Sir <hi>John Lucas</hi> his Lady and Sister, and carry them at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with swords, guns, and halberts to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Goal. Last of all they bring forth his Mother with the like or greater insolency, who being faint and breathless, hardly obtained leave to rest herself in a Shop by the way; yet this leave was no sooner obtained, but the rest of that rude rabble threatned to pull down the house, unless they thrust her out, being by this means forced to depart from thence. A Countryman (whom the Alarm had summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this work) espies her, and pressing with his Horse through the crowd, struck at her head with his sword so heartily, that if an Halbert had not cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the blow, both her sorrows and her journey had there found an end. Two Gentlewomen (one of which had long been sick) by flight escaped their fury, but their most well-wishing neighbours dared not to be known to receive them into their house, the people threatning to burn that house that gave them entertainment. Having secured the Master, they now begin to plunder the house, all is prize that comes to hand, money, plate, jewels, linnen, woollen, brass, pewter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A few hours disrobe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103099:10"/>
the house of that rich furniture that had adorned it many years. The Mayor and Aldermen standing by all this while, but either not able, or not willing to conjure down the Devil which themselves had raised up. All the servants they could meet with they bring to prison, they lay hands on <hi>John Brown,</hi> (one who had been a servant to the family from the time of Sir <hi>John Lucas</hi>'s Grandfather) they bind him to a tree, set a Musquet to his breast, and a sword to his throat, and tie lighted matches between his fingers, and <hi>John Furley</hi> (a young pragmatical boy) examines him concerning his Masters inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Horses, Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but especially concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Mr. <hi>Newcomin,</hi> whether he had not given an Oath of secrecy? Whether he were not to ride a great Horse? whether he were not habited in a Buff Jerkin and Velvet Coat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Fear easily prompts the old man to answer what he thought would give content. Out of his Examination the Mayor frames an Information against Sir <hi>John</hi> and Mr. <hi>Newcomin,</hi> not forgetting to relate the good service he had done, the Horse and Arms he had taken, but withal implying how miserably the house was plundered by the zealous people, adding in his Letters (and that very truly) that he could do no more than a Child among them, with these Letters he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently dispatcheth a Post to the House of Commons.</p>
                  <p>About one a clock a new Alarm is raised, that 200 armed Horsemen are discovered in a Vault at Sir <hi>John Lucas</hi>'s; That they had killed nine men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and were issuing forth to destroy the Town. The shops are shut up in an instant, and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tUde throng down thither to take or kill these Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers. And because they find none there, they now spend their rage upon the house, they batter down
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103099:10"/>
the doors and walls, beat down the windows, tear his Evidences, deface his Walks, and Gardens, do any thing that may do mischief. From thence they go to his Park, pull down his Pales, kill his Deer, drive away his Cattel. And to shew that their rage will know no bounds, and that nothing is so sacred or venerable which they dare not to violate, they break into S. <hi>Giles</hi> his Church, open the Vault where his Ancestours were buried, and with Pistols, Swords, and Halberts, transfix the Coffins of the dead.</p>
                  <p>And now the Mayors care begins to shew it self, he sets a guard upon the house that no hurt should be done unto it, yet that Guard suffered 100 <hi>l.</hi> worth of corn (which at first was neglected as contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble luggage) to be carried out, and the most of it to their own houses. Another Guard he sets upon the Prison, lest the Prisoners should be assaulted by the people who were so much incensed against them, though it had been fit to set some honest men to guard them from those Guardians, who were as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as the people to drink their blood.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Thursday</hi> comes down Sir <hi>Thomas Barrington</hi> and Mr. <hi>Grimston</hi> as a Committee from the House, who comming into the market place before the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son-door (the Town Hall not able to receive the least part of the multitude) there published two Orders from the House, one wherein Sir <hi>John Lucas</hi> and his adherents were praclaimed guilty of high Treason for intending to assist the King. Another wherein thanks were given the People for the good service they had done, yet they were told withal, that their Act of Plundering was against the sense of the House. Some of the agents in that work, produced a printed Order of Parliament (not heard of before among honest men) by which they justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103099:11"/>
what they had done; Sir <hi>Thomas Barrington</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed that it was a false and feigned Order, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the malignant party to render the House o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and very lovingly besought the people to do so no more. And indeed the next weeks Diurnal tells us, that <hi>upon occasion of the outragious plundering in Essex, It was Ordered that thenceforward none should Plunder but those that were authorized by the House to do it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Friday</hi> was designed for the carrying up of the Traytors (Sir <hi>John Lucas</hi> and <hi>Newcomin</hi>) for whom there was one Messenger come from the Black Rod, and another from the Serjeant at Arms, (for the Ladieswere declared no Prisoners after they had layn in the common Goal four days.) When the time of their departure was come, many thousands of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were gathered together (both of Town and Country) a Drum being struck up to give them warning. The Coaches are come, and the Prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers called forth; only Mr. <hi>Newcomin</hi> they dared not carry forth as yet, because the people threatned to tear him in pieces; as assuredly they had done, had not Mr. <hi>Grimston</hi>'s care been very great, who place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Court of Guard on each side of Sir <hi>Thomas Barrington</hi>'s Coach from the Prison door, brought him forth unexpectedly, and put him into the Coach, the people then not daring to strike or stone him, lest the mischief intended on him should light on Sir <hi>Thomas Barrington.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Coach being guarded thus a mile out of Town, they passed on, suffering no other strokes but those of the tongue (bitter Curses and Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings) and those they met withal abundantly, at <hi>Chelmsford, Romford,</hi> and in all the Towns whither the news of their Treason had gone before them,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103099:11"/>
Sir <hi>John Lucas</hi>'s captive Horses being carried in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph with the Coach all the way; at <hi>London</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Barrington</hi> sent the Horses to the <hi>Red Lion,</hi> the Prisoners to the Serjeant at Arms, where they remained all <hi>Sunday,</hi> not permitted to go to Church with their Keeper: on <hi>Monday</hi> they were sent for to the house, and committed Sir <hi>John Lucas</hi> to the <hi>Gate-house,</hi> Mr. <hi>Newcomin</hi> to the <hi>Fleet.</hi> Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly issued out a Declaration of both Houses to the whole Kingdom, but especially to the County of <hi>Essex,</hi> ordered to be read in all Churches and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels; wherein for the better encouragement of good people (so run the words) it is told them that Sir <hi>John Lucas</hi>'s Horse and Arms are imployed for the service of his Excellency, that Sir <hi>John,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Newcomin</hi> are committed to several Prisons, and shall speedily be brought to their Trial, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive condign punishment according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>John Lucas</hi> was afterward enlarged, giving 40000 <hi>l.</hi> bail to appear upon summons, and not to depart <hi>London</hi> and the Suburbs without leave. Mr. <hi>Newcomin</hi> remained in the Fleet from <hi>Aug.</hi> 29. to <hi>Sept.</hi> 24. being never called for, and at length discharged.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>William Boteler</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> returning about the beginning of <hi>April</hi> 1642. from his attendance, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then Gentleman Pentioner) on the King at <hi>Yorke,</hi> then celebrating Saint <hi>Georges</hi> feast, was by the earnest solicitation of the Gentry of <hi>Kent,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to joyn with them in presenting the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and famous Petition of theirs to the House of Commons, delivered by Captain <hi>Richard Lovelace,</hi> for which service, the Captain was committed Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner to the <hi>Gate-House,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Boteler</hi> to

the <hi>Fleet,</hi> from whence after seven Weeks close Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, no Impeachment in all that time brought in against him, many Petitions being delivered and read in the House for his inlargement, he was at last upon bail of 20000 <hi>l.</hi> remitted to his house in <hi>London,</hi> to attend <hi>de Die in Diem,</hi> the pleasure of the House. And having thus danced attendance Six weeks more, at last he obtained leave for his health sake to go to his own house in <hi>Kent,</hi> called <hi>Barrhams Place</hi> in <hi>Teston,</hi> and from thence, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his health much impaired by long Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, he visited the Wells near <hi>Tunbridg<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>,</hi> leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Servants both in <hi>London</hi> and in the Country a strict charge as of his house, so to give him speedy information, if Serjeant <hi>Hunt</hi> should summon him to make his appearance: while Sir <hi>William Boteler</hi> remained thus a Prisoner to the House, resolving to yield obedience according to the condition of his Bond, 500 Horse and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons under the command of Colonel <hi>Edwine Sandes,</hi> Sir <hi>John Seaton,</hi> and <hi>Dowglas,</hi> accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by several Gentlemen his Neighbours, as Sir <hi>William Brookes,</hi> Sir <hi>Michael Lucy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Lea</hi> Burgess for <hi>Rochester,</hi> Mr. <hi>Blunt,</hi> and others, on the 24. of <hi>August,</hi> between Eight and Nine of the clock at night, beset his house: The Servants were within and the doors shut, only <hi>William Nelson,</hi> Sir <hi>William</hi>'s Groom comming from the Stables, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed through the midst of them to the Hall door, where <hi>Sandes</hi> and <hi>Seaton</hi> stood: They demand of him whether he belonged to Sir <hi>William,</hi> who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering that he did, Thou Rogue, saies <hi>Sandes,</hi> open the door; the poor Groom tried, but could not, but assured them that there should be no resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance made: and withal told them that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103099:12"/>
was at the Wells, but had left order to give them the best welcome the house could afford, and upon notice given would be ready (if they had such Order) to render himself up to the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, whose Prisoner he acknowledged himself to be: and withal offered that if they would have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience but while he went to the back door, the house should open unto them. This so reasonable an answer could not satisfie unreasonable men, who it seems were resolved to force the door, rather than have it opened, to give a peaceable admittance: Therefore they revile the Groom, call him Rogue, and threaten to kill him, not because he would not, but because he could not give them entrance. And to make good their threats, <hi>Sandes</hi> and <hi>Seaton</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded some of their Rout to hold him up against his Masters Hall door, and bad some twelve or more Dragooners to give fire on him, which was done accordingly: on the word given, they that held him withdrew, not trusting to the undistin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing bullet, and presently the Groom fell down, by which means he escaped the fury of the shot, which took effect only on the door, and beat it down. The entrance that was offered, thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, the house is instantly filled by the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the Gentlemen their abettors and the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. The first man they meet with is <hi>Benj. Wiand,</hi> Sir <hi>William</hi>'s Steward, who being demanded by <hi>Sandes</hi> where his Master was, returned answer, the same in effect which before they received from the Groom: <hi>Sandes</hi> was as courteous to the Steward as to the Groom, calls him Rogue, and tells him that he would have his Master alive or dead, commands him to bring him to the Chamber where Sir <hi>William</hi> did lodge, their drawn Swords and Musquets bent
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103099:13"/>
upon him extort obedience. Being brought into the Bed-chamber, <hi>Sandes</hi> demands whether there were no private Outlet or Closet? to lay all naked before him, the Steward folds back the Hangings, by which means the Colonel discovers a Close-stool, which at worst could not be so loathsom, as he was before he died: This sight inraged him, not only to revile the Steward, calling him Rogue, but cruelly to beat him with his Pole-ax; and having thus prepared him, he commands him upon no less pain than the loss of his life, to reveal his Masters Plate and Mony; and to inforce the discovery from him, with drawn Swords they prick him, and force him from one Room to another. At last being come to the Dining Chamber, Colonel <hi>Sandes</hi> causes a dozen of Candles to be lighted, and so to be held to and under the Stewards hands, and lighted Match to be applied between his fingers, for the space of a quarter of an hour, <hi>Sandes</hi> himself all the while looking on, commanded both Candles and Match to be renewed, as often as either went out, or burnt dull. In this Torment they continued the poor soul, until both his hands were shamefully burnt, not being able to relieve himself by that discovery for which they tortured him. Nor was that barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous cruelty thus practised on the Steward only, from him they descend to the rest of the Servants, whom they prick with their Swords, beat with their Pole-axes to the indangering their lives, and all this to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort a Confession where their Masters Mony and Plate were: but when this inhumanity produced not the effect they looked for, they broke up every door, plundered every Trunk and Chest, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined every dark place, from the Closet and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet, to the Powdering-Tub and Oven. Nay the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103099:13"/>
Cellar escaped not their fury; What they could not drink, either Wine or Beer, they let out and poured upon the ground. In this search they found and carried away five hundred pounds in money, and some store of Arms. And because the great adventures of Valiant Knights must not be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, To the Eternal fame of Sir <hi>William Brookes</hi> we are to tell you, that when the Ladies Closet was broken open, besides the Charitable Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Medicinal Syrupes</hi> and <hi>Salves</hi> for the poor and the needy Neighbours, all which were tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled under foot and spoiled, There were some hospitable Provisions for entertainments, as divers sorts of Preserves and other Sweet-meats, and in these this doughty Knight had his finger as deep as any, except a common Soldier, who seeing him feed greedily on a Gally-pot, and presuming his judgment to be good in the choice, (for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is true which end soever you put formost, <hi>A liquorish tail hath a liquorish tooth,</hi>) rudely thrust his whole fist all begrimed and besmeared in blood and powder, into the pot with him: which as it turned his worships stomach for the time, so it may serve as a sure Prognostick, That if these Distractions go on, where the Gentleman hath his finger, the Clown will be sure to have his fist. But to leave him to his Sweet-meats, which perchance may have sour sawce, and return to the Colonel and his plundering Regiment. Being Masters of the House, they plundered and pillaged not only Sir <hi>William Boteler,</hi> but all his Servants, men and maids, not only their Chests, but their very pockets. News of this being brought to Sir <hi>William Boteler</hi> the next morning early by three of the Clock, and finding by their threats, that his life was in danger, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103099:14"/>
to fly for protection to the King at <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> In his way thither at <hi>Pinkeny Mowlton</hi> in <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> he was seized on by the Country people, and by about 150 Horse conveyed first to <hi>Northampton,</hi> and from thence to <hi>London.</hi> About the beginning of <hi>September</hi> he was brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the House of Commons, and there in a full House was examined twice; to whom he gave a full and clear satisfaction in every particular. And being unimpeached, the whole House being utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unable to accuse him of any the least kind of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence or Delinquency, Sir <hi>William Boteler</hi> did then and there in the publick House make his Complaint of this intolerable oppression and injustice, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by name before the House, Colonel <hi>Edwine Sandes,</hi> Sir <hi>John Seaton,</hi> Sir <hi>Michael Livesey,</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Lea,</hi> who then was present sitting in the House, and Sir <hi>William Brookes</hi> with Felony and Burglary, for breaking up his house in the night, and stealing and carrying away his Mony and Goods: and implored the Justice of the House a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. And now behold their great zeal of Justice, their care of the Subjects Property, and the freedom of their persons from illegal Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, instead of harkening to his just complaint, and relieving him in his losses, to keep <hi>Magna Charta</hi> inviolable, they Remand Sir <hi>William Boteler</hi> again Prisoner to the Gate-house, where he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for six months longer: at last being certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that it was really intended if not ordered by the House to send him to <hi>Ipswitch,</hi> he indeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and effected an escape from the Gate-house, and got safe to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he attested all these particulars.</p>

                        <hi>Sir</hi> Hen.

                  </argument>
                  <p>THe last weeks <hi>Mercurius</hi> told you of the Plun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dring of Sir <hi>John Lucas</hi> his House in <hi>Essex</hi> and the barbarous Insolencies practised on him and his. The Tumult was raised and made confident by Success, they go on in Triumph, and like a violent Torrent swelling above its Channel, carry all before them, and fearing no opposition, they divided themselves into several Companies, every place where they come tasts of their Fury and Madness: Some go to Sir <hi>Henry Audly</hi>'s at <hi>Beere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church,</hi> whose house they plundred of its Furniture, and his Grounds and Pastures of his Cattle.</p>
                  <p>Others go to M. <hi>Erasmus Laud,</hi> a poor Minister of <hi>Little Try,</hi> whose very name with these men was a Crime and reason enough to expose him to their Rage: Guilty he was of nothing but a good and honest Name, yet they spoil him of his Goods, drive away his Cattle, rob of 20 <hi>l.</hi> in Monies, his own and his Wives Cloaths, all except those upon their backs: M. <hi>Laud</hi> knowing divers of them, and knowing them to be <hi>Colchester</hi> Men, repaired thither to the Mayor for Justice, and by chance found him well circumstanced for an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103099:15"/>
an action of that nature, both in respect of Place and Company, for he found him at the <hi>Moote-Hall,</hi> and the Aldermen his Brethren with him: Being come thither, he was so far from finding what he sought for, Justice, that he was not permitted to make his complaint, M. <hi>Cole,</hi> one of the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men telling him openly, that they knew him and his Cause, he was the Minister of <hi>Try</hi> that was Plundred the day before, but they had other Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in hand and he must be gone, for they could not hear him.</p>
                  <p>Others of them went to M. <hi>Honifold,</hi> a Batchelor in Divinity, and near 70 years of age, dwelling in <hi>Colchester,</hi> there they rifle his House of all its Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, take away his Bonds, Bills, and Evidences, leave not a Shelf behind them, nor a Pin to hang a Hat on. The good old Man, thinking that Spoil and Robbery had been as punishable now as when he was a young Man, and not knowing that the pretending defenders of the Law had banished all Law out of the Kingdom, went to crave the Mayors assistance, to restore his Goods and punish the Offenders. Alderman <hi>Cole,</hi> the <hi>Fulk</hi> of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> being present, told him, that he wondred he would offer to come abroad being a Man so much hated, and so rated him away. In his return, a multitude of Boys and rude People throng about him, and prosecute him through the streets with Exclamations and Outcries: Nor do they stay here, their hands second their tongues, throwing stones and dirt at him. So little did either the hoary Head and venerable old Age, or the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of his sacred Function afford him protection from the inraged multitude: Many see him, some pity him, but none dare own him or take him into
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103099:15"/>
protection, lest they should divert this swelling tide of popular fury from the good old Man, and draw it on themselves; at last bowels of compassion yearn on him, a Kinsman of his emboldened, what by the urgency of Nature, and the constraint of Charity, opens his doors to afford him shelter from this storm, but all in vain; like so many Bears robbed of their Whelps they double their rage, the multitude threaten to pull down the house unless the prey be delivered up unto them: The good old Man seeing the inexorableness of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors, to make a full return of the kindness which he found, resolves rather to expose his own Person as the subject of their fury, than his Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans house: and so he did, for out he goes unto them, and now having retrieved the Game, they pursue him with a high advanced din and confused clamour: At last when all other means to escape their fury failed, he made a voluntary captivity his safety, and took the Common Gaol for his Sanctuary.</p>
                  <p>Having thus thrown Master <hi>Honifold</hi> into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, not so much the Ignominy of the place where they had lodged him, or saciety of contempt of Gods Minister which they had cast upon him, as the want of more day-light, sets an end to this days Frenzie. They part for the present, but resolve to meet next morning; and so they do, a day or two are too scanty to act their boundless malice. Being met, their next plundering expedition is to the Countess of <hi>Rivers</hi> house at S. <hi>Osyth,</hi> a rich prize: There they enter the House, and being entred, they pull down, cut in pieces, and carry away her costly Hangings, Beds, Couches, Chairs, and the whole Furniture of her House, rob her of her
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103099:16"/>
Plate and Monies: They tear down her Wainscot, Leads, and Windows, they leave not a Door, nor so much as a Bar of a Window behind them. The Countess with her Family, forewarned of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to come thither, made an escape, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to her House at <hi>Melford</hi> in <hi>Suffolk:</hi> Thither within a day or two they pursue her, <hi>Essex</hi> is too narrow to bound the madness of the <hi>Essex</hi> Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; in <hi>Suffolk</hi> they meet with some that are as mad as themselves: Few Counties (the more is the pity) but can yield Companions in such Outrages. From thence she hardly escapes with her life: she abandons her House, and leaves it to the mercy of these new ministers of new Justice, who not only rifle the House, but make strict search for her Person. And that you may guess what spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual men they were, and likewise in what danger this Honourable Person was in, they express them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in this rude unchristian language, <hi>That if they found her, they would try what flesh she had.</hi> From whence she fled to St. <hi>Edmunds-Bury,</hi> where the Gates were shut against her an hour at least; at length she was suffered to lodge there that night, and next day with a strong Guard she was convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of Town, and so keeping her self as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate as she could, made an escape to <hi>London.</hi> Her losses at both her Houses, were valued at an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand pounds at least, though some that knew the rich Furniture that adorned both, affirm it to be no less than an Hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds, besides her Parks in both places were utterly spoiled. One of these Plunderers, whose name was <hi>Bowyer,</hi> was apprehended in <hi>London</hi> selling some of these Goods in the very act, and for this committed to <hi>Newgate</hi> as a Felon, two of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103099:16"/>
Countes's Servants entring into Recognizance to give in Evidence against him for the King, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Petition to the House of Commons, it was ordered he should be discharged without paying any Fees, which was done accordingly. And 'twas but an oversight that his prosecutors had not been laid in his place, and publick thanks decreed him for his zeal to the Cause.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Stevens,</hi> Parson of <hi>South-Hamfield</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> hearing that the Plunderers of that County were coming on him, took Horse and fled, and so saved both himself and his Horse, for he knew that both were sought after. The Father being fled, the Children left to their own providence, bethink how to secure those little pieces of Plate which each had received from the bounty of their Godfathers and Godmothers; neither time nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance could give them latitude of much choice where to hide it, and thinking any place safer than their own House, they run to a poor Woman their Neighbour, and there with her they deposite their whole Treasure. When the Plunderers came and found that the Birds were flown, having intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or as some say, but suspecting that the poor Womans house might hide Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> his Goods, they go to her House and demand them: The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man denies that she hath any of Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> his Goods: hereupon one of the Plunderers strikes her on the head with a Club with such violence, that her Brains came out at her Nostrils. The poor Woman being thus murthered, the bloody Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers insult over her, and say, that the just hand of God was upon her, for lying against her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and denying those parcels of Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> his Goods that were in her possession: so usual a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103099:17"/>
thing it is with these men to blaspheme God, and intitle him to all those wickednesses which they commit on others.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Edward Symmons,</hi> Parson of <hi>Rayne</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> in the Months of <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> 1642, Preached against the sin of Rebellion and Disobedience, and against traducing the King, <hi>slandering the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of Gods Anointed,</hi> and refused to promote the Civil-War (then begun) by stirring up the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to contribute Money, Plate, and Horses to the maintenance of so unnatural, so destructive a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, as most of the Ministers of those parts did. This as it was more remarkable in him, so it was more heinously taken from him, in regard of his former intimate acquaintance with Mr. <hi>Stephen Marshal,</hi> Parson of <hi>Finchingfield</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> the great Incendiary of this unhappy War, and had given him the right hand of Fellowship: Hereupon he was sent for to the House of Commons by a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sevant, and was told, <hi>That he being an Honest Man</hi> (but of a different judgment from the Sence and Vote of the House) <hi>did more prejudice to the good Cause in hand, than a hundred Knaves, and therefore would suffer accordingly:</hi> Which saying since that time, hath been plentifully made good, and veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in many particular Oppressions and Sufferings, unjustly inflicted on him and his whole Family.</p>
                  <p>First, He was Imprisoned and most illegally deprived of his Liberty, for no other cause, but because he would not, contrary to the dictate of Religion, and his own Conscience, countenance and promote an accursed Rebellion against his gracious Sovereign.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He was referr'd after to the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee for <hi>Scandalous Ministers,</hi> thereby to blast his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103099:17"/>
Credit and Reputation in his Ministery: a most diabolical and divelish Course, and a work of him who <hi>is the accuser of the Brethren,</hi> to defame honest Orthodox Ministers with the odious name of <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous</hi> and <hi>Malignants,</hi> though made so neither by error in Doctrin, Wickedness of life, or Debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of conversation, but by the malignity of a Vote, knowing, that by this means, such Ministers do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Testimonies will be of little or no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit afterward with the vulgar: for had it been Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal in a true and proper sense, which they indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to take away out of the Church, they would never have brought over his head, so scandalous, so infamous a man to be Lecturer in his Cure as they did: for to the wounding of Mr. <hi>Simmons</hi> his Soul, and the indangering the Souls of his Parishoners, one <hi>Lemuel Tuke</hi> is appointed Lecturer in Master <hi>Simmons</hi> his Church, a man by education a Weaver, and that had not so much as saluted either Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, yet <hi>while men slept</hi> he intruded into a Cure of Souls in <hi>Nottinghamshire,</hi> from which ever since <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the Parliament began he hath been a <hi>Nonresident:</hi> for not long after the sitting of this Parliament, his Parishoners framed a Bill against him to the Lower House, Articling against him, not only as negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, but insufficient in his calling: Nay they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him of no less than <hi>Barretry</hi> and <hi>Battery, Drunkenness</hi> and <hi>Whordom,</hi> and some such other sins, which in the judgment of all honest men, make a man truly and properly scandalous: yet this man thus Articled against to the House of Commons as Scandalous, is thought worthy to be substituted as a Coadjutor in Mr. <hi>Simmons</hi> his Cure, who only was voted Scandalous, because not Rebellious: so that all the World may judge what it is to be scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103099:18"/>
in this new sense, To honour the King, and to live in obedience to the established orders of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, having preached that it was unlawful to take up Arms against the King, and contrary to the Doctrine of the Scriptures to contribute to a War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, in opposition to <hi>Lemuel Tuke,</hi> who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to poison his People with Sedition and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, affirming openly, that in some Cases it was lawful not only to <hi>Resist,</hi> but (which I tremble to relate) to <hi>kill the King</hi>; instancing in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Athaliah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11. yet the said <hi>Tuke</hi> is countenanced and encouraged, whereas Master <hi>Simmons</hi> for asserting the Truth, was summoned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Committee, there to answer as a Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent: who was so far from a Retractation, that he justified the Doctrine: which he did so fully, that one of the Committee was convicted of it, yet as he himself did, so he would have Master <hi>Simmons</hi> to withold that Truth in unrighteousness: for Sir <hi>Thomas Barrington</hi> (who was the man) confessed that it was a Truth and a Divine Truth, yet not fit to be preached at all times, no not by those that were intrusted with it by God himself, no though it might be in some danger of Impeachment. At last being charged to preach no more such Doctrine, and putting in bail, by the Committee he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to return to his charge. But behold what it is to be voted a Delinquent, or a scandalous Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister by the Committee; it is to be put out of the protection of the Law, and exposed to the fury of the people: for on his return Oath is made before a Justice of Peace, that at <hi>Halstead</hi> in <hi>Essex</hi> it was concluded that an hundred men from <hi>Cogshall</hi> and <hi>Colchester</hi> side (some of that Crew that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103099:18"/>
plundered Sir <hi>John Lucas</hi> his house) should suddenly surprize Mr. <hi>Simmons</hi> in his house, Plunder his goods, and cut off his person as one not fit to live, because he was (as they said) against the Parliament: But by the good providence of God this Conspiracy was discovered and prevented.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they oppressed him in his State, for after his return home, seeing the necessity of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that inundation of wickedness which was overflowing his Charge, and pressed earnestly in conscience according to his duty and place, to labour to undermine that throne of Satan which by the Luxation of the nerves and sinews of Government was like to be set up both there and in all parts of the Kingdom, he bent himself in his Sermon chiefly against the prevailing sins of the time, as Lying and Slandering, Rebellion and Treason, Pride and Oppression, Malice and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty: yet these Sermons by his malicious enemies were interpreted little better than Libells against the Parliament: and upon Information given he was sent for up, three or four times, to the Lower House, to his very great charge and trouble, tho when he came to <hi>London</hi> he was never called to answer to the Accusation. And because he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to contribute voluntarily to the maintenance of the Rebellion, his malicious Neighbours resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to extort it from him in a seeming legal way: for in the rates made for the Royal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidy, they raised him far beyond his just propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore in the first rate, they seized him twice as much, and in the second almost thrice as much as themselves; and contrived their business so cunningly, that they caused him to be sent for up to the Parliament while these things
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103099:19"/>
were in doing, and returned rates in to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer in his absence, that so he might not have the opportunity, by complaint of a just grievance, to relieve himself.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, having by most unjust vexations exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted his Estate, and drained his purse: without hearing his defence indeed without further sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning him to appear, they sequester his Parson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and Glebe, and Tyth, and put one <hi>Robert Atkins</hi> a stranger into Cure; and as they put his Livelyhood into a strangers hands, so they put his life into the power of his Enemies, who are authorized to apprehend him, and carry him Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner to <hi>Cambridg:</hi> but upon Intimation given, he withdrew himself, and leaving all to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his Enemies, was forced by flight to secure his Person.</p>
                  <p>And here by the way give me leave to observe one thing to the Courteous Reader, and it is the Reason which was alledged in the sequestration of Mr. <hi>Simmons</hi> his Parsonage, and indeed is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally used in all these sequestrations, and it is, <hi>For the better supply of an able and godly man in the said Church:</hi> I would they could tell us where we should find these two Epithites <hi>Able</hi> and <hi>Godly</hi> to meet in any one of those which they have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted in the Revenues and imployments of those Orthodox Divines, which they have banished from their Cures and families: do but survey the new Plantations which they have made, and you will think that <hi>Jereboams</hi> Priests were risen again from the dead, the lowest and basest of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: for while honest, learned, and conscientious men could not suffer themselves to be made the base instruments to corrupt and seduce the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103099:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
multitudes to comply with the reasonable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of the heads of this Rebellion, it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to seek out and invite such of the Clergy into their Party, whom either want of Merit, or want of Honesty, had left destitute of Means; and when Orthodox Men are displaced or driven away, and such Trencher Chaplains put in their places, we may easily guess what work is in hand, even the alteration of the Government: For while they are so earnest both to Preach and Print that other Forms of Government are God's Ordinance as well as Monarchy, they will in time go on to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue Monarchy in comparison of the rest: But to leave my Diversion, and to return to Mr. <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Living Sequestrated, and his Person exposed to the licence of his veriest Enemies, but he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing himself from this Storm, and being out of their reach, they reek their malice on his poor Wife and Children, and his aged Father: They threaten to beat down the House about their Ears, unless they would yield possession to Mr. <hi>Atkins,</hi> His Father, for cutting down three Trees on the Glebe for necessary uses, and an honest Parisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for loving Mr. <hi>Simmons,</hi> and plowing his Land, were most maliciously handled, and sent for up before the Committee in the <hi>Exchequer Chamber:</hi> And when after all these Threats and Oppressions they still keep possession of the Parsonage House, having no place else wherein to put their Heads, at last, <hi>May</hi> the 15, <hi>Watt Tyler,</hi> I mean <hi>Watt Long,</hi> whom some call Colonel <hi>Long,</hi> came with some Troops of Horse, and cast his whole Family out of Doors, his aged Father, his Wife and three Children, the eldest but seven years old, and his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103099:20"/>
Servants; and so gave possession of the House to Mr. <hi>Atkins.</hi>

                  <p>He that desires to be better satisfied concerning this faithful Minister of God, and what raised this Persecution against him, let him have recourse to that Learned and Orthodox Book of his lately Published, called, <hi>A Loyal Subjects Belief,</hi> worthy every Mans reading, wherein he shall see a solid and satisfactory Answer to all those Arguments divulged by way of a Letter by <hi>Stephen Marshal,</hi> the great Patriarch of Rebellion, whereby he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to maintain the Lawfulness of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent War against the King: In which Letter you may see the true Character of a Cauterized Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, for as if he were afraid the World should not think him sealed up to a Reprobate sense, and past all grace of Repentance; he tells us that as soon as he hath recovered his Health (much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by a hot eager prosecution of this Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion) he intends to return (with the Dog to his Vomit) to sacrifice his strength to the service of the Cause and his Excellency, in all which, while he labours to free himself from the imputation of Madness, and apologizeth against a prevailing Report, that the horror of his guilt had distracted him, he proves himself to be madder than ever the World took him.</p>

                  <p>In <hi>August,</hi> 1641. there was an Order published by the House of Commons, (indeed by some lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in a Committee) for the taking away all Scandalous Pictures out of Churches, in which there was more intended by the Authors than at first their Instruments understood, until instructed by private information how far the People were to inlarge the meaning. When this Order came forth, there was standing in the Chancel a goodly fair Window at the East end, untouched from the first foundation of the Church, in which was painted the History of Christ, from his Conception to his Ascension: And to perpetuate the memory of the Benefactors, in the vacant places there were the Eschochions and Arms of the ancient Nobility and Gentry, who had contributed to the building and beautifying that fair structure. In obedience to the Order, the Church-wardens took down the Pictures of the blessed Virgin, and of Christ on the Cross, and supplied the places with white Glass. But the Sectaries who understood the sense of that Order better than the Church-Wardens, did rest very ill satisfied with this partial imperfect Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: That therefore they might, according to the phrase of the Times, make a through Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, on the Fifth of <hi>November</hi> in the Evening, all the Sectaries assemble together, and in a Riotous manner with long Poles and Stones, beat down and deface the whole Window.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:103099:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>This exercise of an usurped power in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple without the lawful Magistrate, like that which <hi>Andreas Corolostadius</hi> put in practice in the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation under <hi>Luther,</hi> and was sharply condemned by him; and indeed gave the unhappy occasion to that Schism, which is hardly made up at this day; stirred the spirit of the Doctor to inveigh, the next Lords Day, against popular tumultuous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, though to the better: As being vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>First,</hi> By the defect of lawful Authority, which cannot reside in the People. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperancy of the prosecution, who commonly cast out one Devil by another; abolishing Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition with Sedition. This so incensed the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries thus to be opposed in their furious Zeal, that they threatned the Doctor to ruine him, if he preached any more on that subject: And to let him see how welcome such Doctrine was unto them, there was a Carbine discharged at a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of that room where the Doctors usual abode was, the Bullet passed through the place, and in all probability had slain him, had not the good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God (without which a Sparrow falls not to the ground) diverted him unexspectedly from a business before known to be appointed for that place and hour. This design frustrated, about a fornight after, one of these new Proselytes, a young Clothier, with others possessed with the same frenzy, came into the Church immediately after Divine Service was ended, laid violent hands upon the Doctor, took him by the Throat, and would have torn his Surpl<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> off his Back, and were so so inraged, that had not some of his honest peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Parishoners come to his rescue, they had in all probability endangered his Life: But whom they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103099:22"/>
could not wound with their hands, they cut with their tongues, <hi>as with a sharp Razor:</hi> They revile him and call him <hi>Baals</hi> Priest, and Popish Priest, for wearing the Rags of <hi>Rome</hi>; nay, they cry out against him as a perjured Person, that had violated his faith engaged in the Protestation, to abolish Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, of which (in their opinion) wearing the Surpless was a part. Many attempts they made upon the Doctor and his Curate, affronting them, both in officiating Divine Service, and administration of the Sacraments; but they being countenanced by a considerable part in the Town, the Sectaries could not effect what they desired, until at last in the Months of <hi>June, July,</hi> and <hi>August,</hi> 1642. they were animated by the coming of the Forces rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in <hi>Essex, Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Norfolk:</hi> For as they rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed each Company it was sent to <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> the common Rendezvouz, and there staied until they were made up three hundred, or four hundred, and so sent to <hi>London.</hi> In all the time of their stay there, the Doctor lay at the mercy of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who egg'd on by the <hi>Brownists</hi> and <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi> of the Town, used his House as their Quarter, consumed his provisions for his Family, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded there as Lords. Amongst many Outrages committed by the Soldiers, Three are most remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable.</p>
                  <p>First, Upon a Fast Day, they send a Command to the Doctor, that he should not pray for the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> nor so much as make mention of them in his Lips, nor use the Book of Common-Prayer; if he did, they threaten to pull him out of the Pulpit, and tear him in pieces: The Doctor not intimida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their Threat, gives order to his Curate to read the Prayers appointed; which accordingly he
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103099:22"/>
did. The Soldiers right bred, being Volunteers of <hi>Colchester</hi> and <hi>Ipswich,</hi> and rightly designed too, for my Lord <hi>Sayes</hi>'s own Regiment, fit Soldiers for such a Leader, irreverently fit with their Hats on, make a noise to drown the Curates voice, nay, they call to him to come out of his <hi>Calves Coope,</hi> meaning the Reading-Desk, and make an end of his Pottage: The Curate remembring that advice of our Saviour, <hi>Not to cast Pearls before Swine, nor holy things to Dogs,</hi> gives over reading, unwilling to expose the holy Worship of God to so foul Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Scorn. Having thus silenced the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, their Commanders looking on, they violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take the Sacred Bible to tear it, but being repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for it by Sergeant Major <hi>Bamfeild</hi> then present, they exchange the Bible for the Book of Common-Prayer: Having it in their power, in solemn Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph they carry it into the Streets, and that which holy Martyrs inspired by the Holy Ghost compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and sealed the truth and sanctity of it with their dearest Blood, these Savage Miscreants rent in pieces: Some of the leaves they tread under feet, some they cast into the Kennel, some they pissed upon, and some they fixed on the end of their Clubs and Cudgels, and in a Triumphant manner marched with them up and down the Town.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, About a Week after when the Doctor was in the Chancel, there to Interr the Corps of a Gentleman lately deceased, these Soldiers rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the place with an intent to bury the quick with the dead, to put the Doctor into the same Grave, which they had done (for no other reason but because he used the Form prescribed by the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103099:23"/>
Church at burial of the Dead) had he not been powerfully rescued by his Parishoners.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, When the glad Tydings were brought to <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was voted down by the House of Commons, all usual expressions of an exulting joy were used; amongst the rest, Bonfires were kindled in every street, but most of the Fuel was violently taken from the Doctor's Wood-yard. And now the pile raised and the fire kindled, they want nothing but a Sacrifice, this they resolve shall be the Doctor himself: To this purpose, the <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratists</hi> of the Town, assisted by two Companies of Soldiers, in the Evening assault him in his House, seise upon his Person, and are ready to carry him to the Fire, there to throw him headlong into the midst of it: But some of his Friends ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving information of the design, go and acquaint the Commanders with the bloody intentions of their Souldiers, who presently take a Guard and rescue the Doctor out of their power, as soon as ever they had seized on him.</p>
                  <p>Since that oppressed and worried every day by these ravenous Wolves, he was forced to forsake his Charge (as many other godly Ministers are) and to fly for his Life; leaving his Wife and eight Children to the mercy of the Rebels, who have deprived his Family of all their Livelihood, and exposed them to extream want: Nay, they have several times broken violently into his House under pretence to search for him, and have held Pistols cocked, and Swords drawn, at the Breasts of his Children and Servants, charging them upon their Lives, to reveal where the Doctor was.</p>
                  <p>It was lately certified from thence, by a chief Member of that Town, and no friend of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103099:23"/>
that he finds the case there to be far worse than he expected; for while they hoped that the power being (Traiterously) wrested out of the King's hand, they should have shared it amongst themselves, they find that either the power is fallen into their hands that are far beneath them, or else hath raised these men up far above them, for as he writes, <hi>The Town is governed by a Tinker, two Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, two Taylors, two Pedlers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And that the World may see what a Systeme of Divinity these Coblers and Taylors are like in time to stitch together, and what Principles they intend to Rule by, I shall here set down certain prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory prelusory Propositions which they usually Preach (for Preach they do) to their infatuated Disciples, and by them are received as the Divine Oracles of God: And you shall have them in their own Terms, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, <hi>That Kings are the Burdens and Plagues of those People or Nations over which they Govern.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That the relation of Master and Servant hath no ground or warrant in the New Testament, but rather the contrary: For there we read,</hi> In Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus there is neither bond nor free, <hi>and,</hi> we are all one in Christ.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>That the Honours and Titles of</hi> Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts, Lords, Knights <hi>and</hi> Gentlemen, <hi>are but Ethnical and Heathenish distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions amongst Christians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>That one man should have a Thousand Pounds a Year, and another not one Pound, perhaps not so much, but must live by the sweat of his Brows, and must Labour before he eat, hath no ground, neither in Nature or in Scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:103099:24"/>Fifthly, <hi>That the Common People heretofore kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Blindness and Ignorance, have a long time yielded themselves Sorvants, nay, Slaves to the Nobility and Gentry: But God hath now opened their Eyes, and discovered unto them their Christian Liberty: And that therefore it is now fit that the Nobility and Gentry should serve their Servants, or at least Work for their own Maintenance; and if they will not Work, they ought not to Eat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>That Learning hath always been an enemy to the Gospel, and that it were a happy thing if there were no Universities, and all Books burnt, except the Bible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>That any man whom God hath</hi> (as they call it) <hi>Gifted, may be chosen by the Congregation for their Pastor: And that Imposition of Hands by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and Presbytery, are meer Popish Innovations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What more additions to these monstrous Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the wildness of such mens Brains, assisted by the cunning of the Devil, and incouraged by the usurped power of these Times may produce, we must leave to the discovery of Time. In the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim (good Reader) stand amazed, and wonder at this excellent pattern of the intended blessed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Had not God, to prepare us for destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, deprived us of Knowledg, had he not closed our Eyes that we should not see, and hardned our Hearts that we should not understand, were we not a people as the Prophet speaks, forsaken and meted out for destruction, it could not be, but that Mankind would rise up against this Generation of Vipers, and their Protectors, and sweep them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, to use the Metaphor of the Holy Ghost, <hi>with the beesom of destruction,</hi> who if a while connived
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103099:24"/>
at, will prove Moths fretting to the destruction both of Church and State: For in this Model, you may see the <hi>Babel</hi> which is now in building, and the budding forth of those Brambles, out of which (if not timely quenched) will come forth a Fire (as it is in <hi>Jothams</hi> Parable) which will devour the <hi>Cedars</hi> of <hi>Lebanon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same godly Reformers, which plundred Master <hi>Laud,</hi> before mentioned, came afterwards to Master <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Parson of <hi>Peldon,</hi> in the same County of <hi>Essex,</hi> whom they rob of all his goods, within doors and without: They spared not his Library, nor his Wives Child-bed Linnen, though she was great with Child, and in danger by the fright she took at their coming, to have occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make use of them before her due time, they plunder him to the value of Four hundred pounds, a very great sum in a poor Clergy-mans purse, especially as these Times go. For relief of his Loss, he sends his Servant to the Mayor of <hi>Colche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> (a famous Justiciary, as you may remember the last Week, in the relation of Mr. <hi>Laud,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Honifields</hi> Cases) having made his Complaint, and accused the plunderers by name, the Mayor knew that some body deserved Commitment, but had the ill luck to be mistaken in the person, and therefore instead of the plunderers, he Commits Master <hi>Cornelius</hi> his man to the Gaol, where he is lodged for a Malignant, until his Master (plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of his Man too) came and put in Bail, that his Servant should be forth-coming, to answer to all Objections the next Sessions. Master <hi>Cornelius</hi> knowing that he should in vain expect Justice where he found Oppression, from the Mayor goes to Mr. <hi>Gardner,</hi> a Justice of Peace not far off, who
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103099:25"/>
grants his Warrant for apprehension of the parties: Who being apprehended (though for Felony) put in Bail to answer the next Sessions. When the time came, Mr. <hi>Cornelius</hi> indicts these plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the Bill was found by the Grand-Jury upon the evidence of three or four Witnesses, who were Spectators, and saw them carry away the Goods: Nay, the prisoners at the Bar not only confessed the Fact in their Examination before the Justice, when they were first apprehended, but in the face of the Court, and presence of the Jurors: Yet the Petty-Jury, contrary to Reason and their own Consciences, found the Indictment against the King. The Court wondring at so wilful blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, cause the Statute to be read, lay open the Evidence, and remand them back, not doubting but comparing the Fact with the Law, the Result would be a Verdict for the King: They persist in their Obstinacy, and return <hi>Ignoramus.</hi> Being ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Bench, how they could go against so clear Evidence? They answered in general, Because they did not think PLUNDERING (a new name for an old Theft) to be Felony by the Law: But being beaten out of this starting hole, though ten are Convicted, yet two stand out, and give this reason, that they were a Malignants Goods, and the Parliament had given power to plunder such: But when it was replied, That no such Order was produced, nor was it pleaded by the Prisoners at the Bar; they then professed openly, that these men arraigned at the Bar were honest men, that they had an Intent to do them favour, and they would do it. Hereupon the Bench justly incensed against so wilful perjury, binds over the Jurors to answer it the next Assizes: And withal, order
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103099:25"/>
Mr. <hi>Cornelius</hi> to Indict these plunderers again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another Felony; he obeys their command, and the Grand-Jury find it to be <hi>Billa vera:</hi> But when the Under-Sheriff went out to Impanel a Jury to try the prisoners, he could find none but Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, who attended there that day purposely to be of the Jury, and professed openly, that they staied there to save the prisoners. Happy men these, that may commit Murthers, Robberies, and Thefts, and yet fear no Condemnation, neither at the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of God or Man. It is an usual doctrine of this Sect, <hi>That God sees no sin in his Children,</hi> (for that name they will ingross to themselves, though no men less deserve it) and it seems they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to see no sin one in another. It was a wild saying of a great Patriarch of theirs, That the Children of God were <hi>Heteroclites,</hi> because God did often save them, even contrary to his own Rules. I know not how true they will find this assertion at the Great Day, when Murther shall be Murther, and Theft Theft, and God that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judg, who without respect of persons, shall render to every man according to his deeds, yet here on Earth, if these men may judg one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they may commit what wickedness they list, and let the Rains loose to all kinds of Villany, and yet be saved contrary to all the Rules of Law and Justice.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Archer,</hi> Lecturer at the same place, in his Sermon encouraged the people to take up Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King, but it may be objected, says he, that the Gentry gainsay this Doctrine, and the Learned utterly disclaim it as Erroneous and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; but what though the Gentry and Learned (as you call them) dissent, yet let it not Stagger
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103099:26"/>
your belief of this undoubted Truth: For I tell you that in my Conscience you may do it, and in doing it you are so far from sinning, that you will do that which is acceptable to God. Be liberal therefore in contributing to this holy War, and sending forth men to fight this Battel of the Lord. This man in his Prayers and Sermons, constantly calls the Parliament, <hi>The Lords Anointed,</hi> but with what Oyl it is not yet determinated: I am sure by experience, we find that it is not <hi>Oyl of Gladness.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>ON Monday, the 15 of <hi>August,</hi> 1642. Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Mynshul</hi> of <hi>Bourton,</hi> in the County of <hi>Buckingham</hi> Knight, furnished with ten Horse and Arms, began his journey into the North to wait upon the King, as in the duty of a Servant and Subject he was bound. This being discovered (for they have spies in every corner) to the Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> Sir <hi>Peter Temple,</hi> Sir <hi>Rich. Ingoldsby,</hi> Master <hi>Goodwine,</hi> and others then at <hi>Aylesbury,</hi> leaders of an Army raised against his Majesty. It fell under
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103099:26"/>
consideration to make Sir <hi>Richard Mynshul</hi> a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to deter others from serving the King, since it was not to be done but by exposing their persons to Imprisonment, and their Estates to Plundering, for the Result of that deliberation was, that since they could not secure his person, they would seise on his Estate. Nor do they stay long before they put the sentence in execution: For on Thursday the 18 of <hi>Aug.</hi> the Lord <hi>Brook</hi> commanding a great part of the Army, came to Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s House, and in case he should find Resistance, they bring divers pieces of Ordnance to batter the House: but being come they find no opposition. The first company that enters the House were under the command of one Captain <hi>Jones,</hi> who either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing the Oppression, or yet not fleshed in the sin, which but then found footing in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, (for this was the first of this kind commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Buckinghamshire,</hi> and the second in <hi>England</hi>) moderated the eagerness of the Soldiers sharp set on the prey, so that they gleaned but a little here and there; this moderation renders Captain <hi>Jones</hi> suspected for a Papist, both to the Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> and the rest of the Commanders: Nay, he is not only voiced for a Papist, but a Rumour is raised that he was Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed into this Moderation, and had taken a reward to spare Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s Goods: The Captain blasted with these reports, the jealousie of him grew so high that they threaten to kill him: To avoid the fury of the Soldiers he is fain to withdraw himself, nor durst he appear before a Servant of Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards</hi> had made Oath, that he was Innocent of any such Contract. And now the Lord <hi>Brook</hi> and his Company being masters of the House, the first thing on which they express their rage is the Kings
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103099:27"/>
Picture, which with their Swords they most traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously pierce through in divers places: And not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to wound him in that representation, (whose person God miraculously hath, and we hope will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve from them) they whet their Tongues against their Sovereign, using Traiterous and scornful Language against him: By all which it is more than manifest to all the World, what they would do to the Substance, if they had him in their power, that express such malice on his shadow: Having at first entrance violated their Loyalty to their King (according to his Majesties frequent predictions) their fellow Subjects cannot expect Justice at their hands: Now all is lawful prize that comes to hand, Money, Plate, Jewels, many suits of rich Hangings, Linnen, Bedding, they plunder from the Cabinet to the Larder, and make clean work as they go, leaving no Booty for a second plunder. And though that House were but one, yet in that one they plundered three, Sir <hi>Richard</hi> having disrobed two Houses, one in <hi>Essex,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>London,</hi> thinking to secure all in this third: While these things were in doing, the Lord <hi>Brook</hi> with other Commanders, commands the Wine-Seller to be broke up: But in a saucy imitation of greatness, they will not drink without a Taster, yet not being confident enough professedly to own Regal observances for prevention of danger, a pretence was made that the Wine was poisoned, and one of Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s Servants is compelled (a Pistol set to his Breast) to begin and lead the way, that if there were any danger, the experiment might be made in him; he having gained a cup of Wine by their dissembled State, they follow freely, and drink very liberally to the good success of their
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103099:27"/>
designs: without ever scrupling whether drinking so, did not come within the nature of a <hi>a Health.</hi> And indeed 'twas an oversight that <hi>Casuist Prin</hi> was not consulted in the Case, the Cup often gone round, at last some inspired with the Spirit of Wine, prophesied that Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s Treasure was buried in the Cellar, presently they fall to digging, and instead of Treasure, find a Mine of Bottles; they drink up the Wine, and in indignation break the Bottles: From hence to cool the Wine, they go to the Beer-Seller, and in both what they could not drink, they break the Vessels, and let run on the ground: After this they break open the Library, and the place where he kept his Evidences: They seise on all the Bills, Bonds, Deeds, Evidences, Writings, and Books, which they find whether Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s, or his Friends; some of these they take away with them, some they tear in pieces, some they bind in bundles, and make them serve instead of Fuel, both to heat Ovens, and to roast Meat for their Supper; and would by no means suffer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them to be redeemed, though large sums of Money were offered for them: The House it self escapes not their fury, wanting Ladders to come at the Lead, they supply this defect with the Racks broken down from the Stables; they rip up the Lead and carry it away, they tear down the walls of the Houses with Spades and Mattocks, they dig up the lower Rooms, hoping there to find more Treasure: They break the Windows, Doors, Wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scot, Seelings, Glass, they take away all Iron Bars, Casements, Locks, Keys and Hinges: They break open his Wool-house and Barns, and empty all: They enter the Dove-house, and like Vermine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Pidgeons; onely one of these Vermine
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103099:28"/>
falling from the Holes, brake his Back and died thereof: and because they could not carry away his House covertly they indeavour to fire it, to this purpose they leave Matches burning in the Mats, but were discovered. From his House they issue out into his Grounds; there they lay all common, they break up his Rales and Fences: Of his Sheep what they did not eat, they sold, Sheep worth 20 <hi>s.</hi> for 12 <hi>d.</hi> Lambs worth 10 <hi>s.</hi> for 6 <hi>d.</hi> and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons why the rates of their market were so low, were, first, they were a Malignant and a Traitors Goods (so they stiled Sir <hi>Richard.</hi>) Secondly, They were sold to their Brethren, and therefore must afford good Penniworths. The rest of the Stock they run their Swords or Pikes into most of them and spoiled them. Nor was Plunder the only thing they looked after, Blood is in their thoughts. First, They send a Troop of Horse to pursue Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> and threaten to cut him as small as Herbs to the Pot: They clap a strong Guard on Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s Lady, deny her a Bed to lie on, though the Neighbours earnestly intreated to kill them if they can find them: Who (poor Souls) affrighted with these barbarous Insolencies, fled into the Field, and hid themselves in growing Hemp, and there lay on the Ground almost 20 Hours, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Meat or any sustenance, so that what with fright and dampness of the Earth, some of them contracted dangerous Sicknesses, and hardly esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with Life. The Terrour which fell upon the Country thereabout was so great, that the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Justice of Peace durst not grant his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to search after any of Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s Goods, though earnestly intreated to it: And the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours were so ill used and threatned, to extort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103099:28"/>
from them where Sir <hi>Richard</hi> was, or where any of his Goods were conveyed, that some swoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for fear, some fell mad, and some died. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is their carriage was so barbarous, that it inforced Mr. <hi>Jo. Crew,</hi> one of the Company, to profess his dislike, and to tell the Lord <hi>Brooks</hi> and the rest, That they being Law-makers should not be Law-breakers, nor make such precedents as would discover their intentions, and render them odious unto the Country: Since that, knowing Sir <hi>Richard</hi> to have put himself for preservation of his Life under his Majesties Protection, they have caused his Pond-heads to be digged down, and have destroyed all his Fish, they have cut down his Woods, and seised on all his Lands, or made them utterly unprofitable unto him, for they will not suffer any Bayliff or Servant of his to take any care of his Estate, but have often sent parties of Horse to seise on them, or kill them.</p>
                  <p>At a place called <hi>Kings-harbour</hi> near <hi>Hounslow-heath,</hi> three Soldiers, under the Command of the Lord <hi>Wharton,</hi> came into a House to drink, going away, they of the House demand Money for their Drink: So unexpected an affront did so incense the Soldiers, that one of them told his Companions he would shew them how they set Houses on fire in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and so put his Carbine into the Thatch and discharged it, set the House on fire and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. The General <hi>ESSEX</hi> returning from <hi>London,</hi> came by as the House was on fire, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint is made unto him, that the owner of the House was undone, but all in vain, his Excellency was not at leisure to do Justice.</p>
                  <p>The Countess of <hi>Rivers</hi> (who as you heard in the second Weeks Relation, was Plundered to the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103099:29"/>
value of an Hundred thousand, or an Hundred and fifty thousand pounds) finding her abode here unsafe, having lost her Goods, and her Person in danger; to secure her self, resolved for a time to abandon her Country, and rather expose her self to the hazard of Travel, than commit her self to that protection which the contemned Laws now afford. To this purpose she obtained a Pass to go beyond Seas: While she was in preparing for her Voyage, Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> Plunder-master General, he that so familiarly speaks Treason, and steals the King's Horses, or doth any thing, plunders the Countess of her Coach Horses, notwithstanding a Warrant from the Lords House to secure them: And when this Warrant was produced to stave off this Parliament Horse-taker, he replied, That if the Warrant had been from both Houses he would obey it, as coming from the highest authority in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (sure this man was born with Treason in his Mouth) but since it came <hi>But</hi> from the Lords he did not value it. When this Warrant could not prevail, the Countess obtains a Warrant from the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> to have the Horses restored unto her again, but Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> to overbear all, procures an Order from the House of Commons to keep them. This Honourable Ladies Goods were seised on, though Licensed to pass by the Lords, and searched and allowed by the Custome-House.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Pebmarsh,</hi> in the same County of <hi>Essex,</hi> on the Lords Day, divers of the Parliament Voluntiers came into the Church, while the Parson, Mr. <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borow</hi> was in his Prayer before Sermon, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced themselves near the Pulpit, and when he was in his Prayer, one of them struck divers times with his Staff against the Pulpit to interrupt him, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103099:29"/>
while he was in his Sermon, in contempt of the place where they were, and the sacred action in doing, they were almost as loud as the Preacher, to the great disturbance of the Congregation. No sooner was the Sermon ended, and the Parson come out of the Pulpit as far as the Reading-desk, but they lay violent hands upon him, rent his Clothes, threaten to pull him in pieces in the Church. With much intreaty they spare him there, and permit him to go into the Church-yard; he is no sooner come thither, but they assault him more violently than before: Mr. <hi>Wiborow</hi> seeing the Constable (who all this while stood a spectator of his hard usage) calls unto him, and charges him in the King's Name to keep the Kings Peace: At his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest they did a little forbear him: But before he could get half ways Home, they assault him again, and demand the Book of Common-Prayer which he used in the Church, (That which was found by the Parish, being torn in pieces before) which he refusing to deliver up unto them, they reek their fury on him: They tug and hale him, and vow to kill him, unless he deliver up the Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer to their pleasure; he stoutly refuseth: Hereupon they fall upon him, strike up his Heels, and take it from him by force, and so carry it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in triumph.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Blakerby</hi> (a silenced Minister heretofore) preaching at <hi>Halstead</hi> in the same County, told them, That to bow at the Name of <hi>Jesus,</hi> was to thrust a Spear into Christ's side; and such Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters as signed Children with the sign of the Cross, did as much as in them lay to send such Children unto the Devil.</p>

                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:103099:30"/>When the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> and the rest went from <hi>Reading</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> after the unhappy (to say no more) surrender of that town, they left there a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, consisting of none but City Captains and Tradesmen, these according to the authority com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto them, summon all the able men of the Parishes thereabout, to appear before them at <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> and Assessed them at their pleasure.

O that we were but so wise as to compare our Conditions! certainly then we could not but acknowledg the just wrath of God upon us for our Ingratitude, murmuring so much when we had so little cause, and bless God for the

return of our former Peace, though with all its Grievances, and those maliciously aggravated.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Giles Thorne,</hi> Batchellor in Divinity, and Parson of S. <hi>Cutberts</hi> in <hi>Bedford,</hi> was upon Sunday in the beginning of <hi>August</hi> last, 1642. apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Parish Church immediately after he came out of the Pulpit (having preached three Sermons in the Town that day) by the Lord <hi>Saint-Johns</hi> Troops, who lay then in <hi>Bedford,</hi> and in a very boysterous manner carried away to an Inn in the Town, not permitted to go home to his House to visit his Family, nor any of his Friends suffered to come to him: The next day he was carried away to <hi>London,</hi> where when he had lain more than three Weeks under the Messengers hands, he was brought to his Trial at the Bar in the Lords House: Accusations are framed against him out of Sermons preached nine years before. Witnesses are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to prove the Articles, who so well remembred what they were to say, that they were fain to read their Depositions out of Papers which they brought in their hands. Mr. <hi>Thorne</hi> gives so full an Answer to all the Objections, that the Lords pronounce themselves satisfied, and him Innocent, only the Lord <hi>Say</hi> disputes with him, and the Earl of <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingbrooke</hi> grumbles at him. At length it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that there is another Witness in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try that can say somewhat, (especially if it be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten down in a Paper, as it was to his fellow Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents): Hereupon he is committed to the <hi>Fleet,</hi> there to remain till that Witness can be prevailed with to find leisure to come up. About three Weeks after the Witness appears, and is Sworn, and contrary to the Rules of that Court, is sent to be examined by a Clerk. Mr. <hi>Thorne,</hi> with much
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103099:31"/>
ado obtains a Copy of his Depositions; which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on view contain no new Matter, but what he had before answered unto and cleared: Hereupon he Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions again for a Sentence; he is ordered to attend the House: After a chargeable attendance of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny days with his Keeper, he is called, the Cause reviewed, upon the review, the Earls of <hi>Pembroke, Holland, Clare,</hi> and divers others, affirm, that in their consciences they had Acquitted him at the first hearing, and now upon the review, found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to alter their opinion, and therefore thought it fit he should be Discharged. But well fare a good Neighbour at a dead life: The Earl of <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingbrook</hi> objects, That he is a man of a Malignant spirit, that he hath great Interest in the Affections of the People amongst whom he lives, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if Inlarged and remitted Home, may do much prejudice to the good Cause in hand; upon these just and weighty Considerations, Mr. <hi>Thorne</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to the Fleet: Since that time he hath used the assistance of many Friends, drawn many Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, humbly desiring that he might be heard: Or if the great Affairs of State would not afford their Lordships so much leisure, that he might have leave upon Bail to go down to attend his Cure, until their Lordships should please to call for him: But was so far from obtaining his desire, that he could never get so far towards it, as to have his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition read. His Parishoners sensible of his Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and their own Injury, being bereaved of the comfort and labours of their own Pastor, sent up a Petition subscribed with three hundred hands to the same effect, that Justice might have a free un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted course, either to Condemn or Absolve him, but all in vain: So that for ought we yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand

he is still a Prisoner, and for any thing we are informed to the contrary, he is without hopes for Enlargement, though his Judges have pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him Innocent.

                  </argument>
                  <p>ON Tuesday the second of <hi>May,</hi> 1643. Sir <hi>Edward Hungerford,</hi> a chief Commander of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103099:32"/>
the Rebel in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> came with his Forces before <hi>Warder</hi> Castle in the same County, being the Mansion-House of the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Warder:</hi> But finding the Castle strong, and those that were in it resolute, not to yield it up unless by force, called Colonel <hi>Strode</hi> to his help: Both these joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one, made a Body of 1300. or thereabout. Being come before it, by a Trumpeter they sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the Castle to surrender: The reason pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was, because the Castle being a Receptacle of Cavaliers and Malignants, both Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had ordered it to be searched for Men and Arms, and withal by the same Trumpeter decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that if they found either Money or Plate, they would seise on it for the use of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Lady <hi>Arundel</hi> (her Husband being then at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and since that dead there) refused to deliver up the Castle, and bravely replied, That she had a command from her Lord to keep it, and she would obey his command. Being denied en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, the next day being Wednesday, the third of <hi>May,</hi> they bring up the Cannon within Musket shot and begin the Battery, and continue it from the Wednesday to the Monday following, never giving any intermission to the besieged, who were but 25 fighting men, to make good the place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an Army of 1300. In this time they spring two Mines; the first in a Vault, through which Beer and Wood, and other necessaries, were brought into the Castle: This did not much hurt, it being without the foundation of the Castle. The second was conveyed into the small Vaults, which by reason of the intercourse between the several Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages to every Office, and almost every Room in the Castle, did much shake and indanger the whole
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103099:32"/>
Fabrick. The Rebels had often tendered some unreasonable conditions to the Besieged to surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as to give the Ladies, both the Mother and the Daughter in Law, and the Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren Quarter, but not the Men; the Ladies both infinitely scorning to Sacrifice the Lives of their Friends and Servants, to redeem their own from the cruelty of the Rebels, who had no other crime of which they could count them guilty, but their fidelity and earnest endeavours to preserve them from Violence and Robbery, chose bravely (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Nobleness of those Honourable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies from which they are both extracted) rather to die together, than Live on so dishonourable terms. But now the Castle brought to this distress, the Defendants few, oppressed with number, tired out with continual watching and labour from Tuesday to Monday, so distracted between Hunger and want of rest, that when the hand endeavoured to administer Food, surprized with sleep, it forgat its imployment, the morsels falling from their hands while they were about to eat, deluding their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites now when it might have been a doubt which they would first have laded their Musquets withal, either Powder before Bullet, or Bullet before Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, had not the Maid-servants (valiant beyond their Sex) assisted them, and done that service for them. Lastly, Now when the Rebels had brought Petarrs, and applied them to the Garden Door (which if forced, opened a free passage into the Castle) and Balls of wildfire to throw in at their VVindows, and all hope of keeping the Castle was taken away, now, and not till now, did the Besieged found a Parley. And though in their Diurnals at <hi>London,</hi> they have told the VVorld
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103099:33"/>
that they offered Threescore thousand pounds to redeem themselves and the Castle, and that it was refused, yet few men take themselves to be bound any thing the more to believe it, because they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it. I would Mr. <hi>Case</hi> would leave preaching trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and instruct his Disciples to <hi>put away Lying, and speak every man truth with his Neighbour:</hi> Certainly the World would not be so abused with untruths, as now they are: Amongst which number this report was one, for if they in the Castle offered so liberally, how came the Rebels to agree upon Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Surrender, so far beneath that Overture? For the Articles of Surrender were these:</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>That the Ladies and all others in the Castle, should have Quarter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That the Ladies and Servants should carry away all their Wearing Apparel, and that six of the Serving Men, whom the Ladies should nominate, stould attend upon their Persons, wheresoever the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels should dispose of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>That all the Furniture and Goods in the House should be safe from Plunder, and to this purpose, one of the six, nominated to attend the Ladies, was to stay in the Castle, and take an Inventory of all in the House, of which the Commanders were to have one Copy, and the Ladies another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But being on these terms Masters of the Castle, and all within it, 'tis true, they observe the first Article, and spare the lives of all the Besieged, though they had slain in the defence at least 60 of the Rebels: But for the other two, they observe them not in any part: As soon as they enter the Castle, they first seise upon the several Trunks
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103099:33"/>
and Packs, which they of the Castle <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> making up, and left neither the Ladies or Servants any other wearing clothes but what was on their backs. There was in the Castle amongst many rich ones, one extraordinary Chimney-piece, valued at two thousand pounds, this they utterly def<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ce, and beat down all the carved works thereof with their Pole-Axes. There were likewise rare Pictures, the work of the most curious Pencils that were known to these latter times of the VVorld, and such that if <hi>Apelles</hi> himself (had he been now alive) need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to blush to own for his. These in a wild fury they break and tear in pieces, a loss that neither cost nor Art can repair. Having thus given them a taste what performance of Articles they were to expect from them, they barbarously lead the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the young Ladies children, two Sons and a Daughter, Prisoners to <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> some four or five miles from <hi>Warder.</hi> VVhile they are there Prisoners, to mitigate their Sorrows, in triumph they bring five Cart-loads of their richest Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and other Furniture through <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Dorchester,</hi> and since that, contrary to their promise and faith given, both by Sir <hi>Edward Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerford</hi> and <hi>Strode,</hi> they have Plundered the whole Castle: So little use was there of the Inventory we told you of, unless to let the VVorld know, what my Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> lost, and what these Rebels gained. This havock they made within the Castle. Without they burn all the Out-houses, they pull up the Pales of two Parks, one of Red Deer, the other of Fallow: what they did not kill, they let loose to the world for the next taker. In the Parks they burn three Tenements and two Lodges, they cut down all the Trees about the House and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103099:34"/>
Grounds, Oaks and Elms, such as few places could boast of the like, whose goodly bushy advanced heads drew the eyes of Travellers on the Plains to gaze on them, these they sold for Four-pence, Six-pence, or Twelve-pence a piece, that were worth three, four, or five Pound a Tree: The Fruit-trees they pluck up by the Roots, extending their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice to commit spoil on that that God by a special Law protected from destruction, even in the Land of his Curse, the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> For so we read, <hi>When thou shalt besiege a City, thou shalt not destroy the Trees thereof, by forcing an Ax against them, for thou mayst eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down to employ them in the Siege: only the Trees which thou knowest that they be not Trees for Meat, thou shalt destroy,</hi> Deut. 20.19, 20. Nay, that which esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped destruction in the Deluge, cannot escape the hands of these children of the <hi>Apollyon</hi> the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. They dig up the heads of twelve great Ponds, some of five or six Acres apiece, and destroy all the Fish: They sell Carps of two foot long for two-pence and three-pence apiece: They send out the Fish by Cart loads, so that the Country could not spend them: Nay, as if the present Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were too narrow an Object for their rage, they plunder Posterity, and destroy the Nurseries to the greater Ponds: They drive away and sell their Horses, Kine, and other Cattle: And having left nothing either in the Air or Water, they dig un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Earth, the Castle was served with Water brought two Miles, by a Conduit of Lead: And intending rather mischief to the Kings Friends than profit to themselves, they cut up the Pipe and fold it (as these mens Wives in <hi>North-Wiltshire</hi> do Bone-lace) at Six-pence a Yard; making that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103099:34"/>
waste for a poor inconsiderable Sum, which two thousand pounds will not make good. They that have the unhappy occasion to sum up these losses, value them at no less than an hundred thousand pounds. And though this loss were very great, not to be parallel'd by any, except that of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess of <hi>Rivers,</hi> yet there was something in these Sufferings, which did aggravate them beyond all example of Barbarity, which this unnatural War now did produce, and that was <hi>Rachels</hi> Tears: Lamentation and Weeping, and great Mourning, a Mother weeping for her Children, and would not be comforted because they were taken from her; for the Rebels as you hear, having carried the two Ladies Prisoners to <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> thinking them not safe enough there, intend to remove them to <hi>Bath,</hi> a place then much infected both with the Plague and the Small Pox: The old Lady was sick, under a double confinement, that of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and her own Indisposition, all were unwilling to be exposed to the danger of the Infection, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the young Lady, having three Children with her, they were too dear, too rich a treasure to be snatched away to such probable loss without relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy: Therefore they resolve not to yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Prisoners for that place, unless they will take the old Lady out of her Bed, and the rest by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and so carry them away. But the Rebels fearing lest so great Inhumanity might incense the People against them, and render them odious to the Country, decline this, and since they dare not carry all to <hi>Bath,</hi> they resolve to carry some to <hi>Dorchester,</hi> a place no less dangerous for the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Schism and Rebellion, than <hi>Bath</hi> for the Plague and the Pox. To this purpose they take
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103099:35"/>
the young Ladies two Sons (the eldest but nine, the younger but seven years of age) and carry them Captives to <hi>Dorchester.</hi>

The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the Mother, pitiful cry of the Children prevail not with them, like ravenous Wolves they seise on the Prey: And though they do not crop, yet they transplant those <hi>Olive Branches that stood about their Parent's Table:</hi> A barbarous fact, and such as must look out of Christendom for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, and hardly find it though among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, except among the unwashed <hi>Turks,</hi> who take Christian Children from their Mothers Breasts either to make a Seminary for their Guards of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries, or by desolation to make them Eunuchs unsuspected Guardians of their Concubines, or if in Christendom amongst none but the Jesuits their Brethren, a Generation whom they would be thought most to hate, yet are known most to imitate, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.

When <hi>Sesibutus,</hi> King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> in the Year 600. prevailed against the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens,</hi> and in a better Zeal than this, but not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to knowledg, compelled his Captives to be Baptized, he quickly found his error by the want of Gods blessing upon his endeavours, nay, Gods dislike was so visible in the success, that the Church of God observing it, determined, That the Children of Infidels not having the use and exercise of right Reason, should not be Baptized <hi>Invitis Parentibus,</hi> contrary to the consent of the Parents. And the fourth Council of <hi>Toledo, Cap.</hi> 56. disallowing the inconsiderate zeal of <hi>Sesibutus,</hi> forbad <hi>to compel any man to the Faith under the censure of Anathema,</hi> and determined withal, that <hi>to baptize Children without the consent of the Parents, is all one as to compel men of full age to be Baptized.</hi> The same determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is cited and approved by the <hi>Canonist, Dist.</hi> 45. <hi>Cap.

to baptize the Children of <hi>Jews, Infidels,</hi> or <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi> without consent of their Parents: Though without Baptism when it may be had, there is no entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven, certainly it must be far more unlawful being baptized to take them from their Parents, to season their tender years with dangerous principles leading to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness, Brownism, Anabaptism, and Rebellion. A just indignation against so barbarous practice hath transported me in this argument farther than I intended, though not so far as the heinousness of the fact deserves, therefore if any man desires to be more fully satisfied of the power and interest which Parents have over and in their Children, being an <hi>Inheritance given them of the Lord,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> and the possession of their Parents, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his <hi>Politicks,</hi> and the great violation of Justice in relation of the Laws of God, Nature and Men, in despoiling their Parents of them, let him have recourse to that Learned and Elegant dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of <hi>Petrus Aerodius,</hi> Chief Justice or Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of <hi>Aniou,</hi> in his Book <hi>de Patria Potestate,</hi> who being robbed of his Son, stoln from him by the Jesuits, to plant him as a hopeful Imp in their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and not able to rescue him out of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, though he implored, and had the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s assistance (for thither he was carried) pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues his Son with Arguments and Labours to recal him to his Obedience, by laying before him his duty artificially Collected, and strongly applied from the Laws, Divine, Natural, and Moral, and therefore to him I remit him, and turn my discourse into its proper channel.</p>
                  <p>On Friday, the 12 of <hi>May,</hi> 1643. Mr. <hi>John Bykar</hi> (Son to the Vicar of <hi>Dunchurch</hi>) was with
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103099:36"/>
his Father in Law, one of the High-Constables of <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> at the Market at <hi>Coventry.</hi> Being in a House in the City, he received some rude af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts from a Soldier of that Garison: He being a very civil man, of good Moderation, and it seems well instructed not to answer a Fool in his Folly, or being reviled to answer again, withdrew himself from the place to decline the insolent mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Soldiers, and free himself from his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations: Being come into the streets, secure, as he thought, from all violence, he was suddenly run through the Body, and falling down, died in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly. His offence was (for as yet we can hear of no others) that he was a <hi>Parsons</hi> Son; so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate malice to that Function and all depending on it, do these Rebels bear. And therefore if in this Relation you meet with frequent mention of Affronts, Oppressions, Plundering, and Murthers of the Ministers of the Gospel, do not attribute it to any partiality, as if the Relator were more querulous for them than others, but to a serious desire to proportion his Labours in a just measure to the merit of each mans case.</p>

the Constables turn well enough to lay hold on him: Having seised on him, they search him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence that he carried Letters of dangerous consequence, but searching, they find what they sought for, his <hi>Money,</hi> 14 <hi>l.</hi> he had about him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this as good Booty they take from him, and for fear he should run away from his Money, that night they set a strong Watch upon him.

The first night they will allow him no Supper, unless he will pay for it, though they knew he had no Money, having themselves seised on all he had. Afterward, upon much opportunity and earnest intreaty, they are pleased out of his own Moneys, to allow him a poor thin allowance of Food by the way.

                  <p>THat the Kingdom might not be undone but at their own charges, sundry Ways and Arts, both by force and intreaty, have been used to extort Monies from the Kings good Subjects, to maintain the present Rebellion. Amongst others, Mr. <hi>Graey</hi> of <hi>Wellingborow,</hi> Clark of the Peace for the County of <hi>Northampton,</hi> was assaulted by persuasion, and very earnestly solicited by Sir <hi>Rowland S. John,</hi> to contribute liberally to this unnatural War: But his refusal to partake in so crying a sin, did produce a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103099:38"/>
double effect, indignation in the Rebels, that hate all men that run not into the same excess of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Rebellion with them, because others back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness doth upbraid their forwardness that rush into Rebellion like the Horse into the Battel: But brought forth imitation in others, not only in <hi>Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingborow,</hi> but in some Villages bordering on that Town: Who seeing so good a president of Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, refuse with him to hearken to so Traiterous proposals: And now thinking themselves indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered by their refusal, and exposed to the mercy of Rebel Plunderers, they enter into a consultation how to secure themselves from violence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to come to each others assistance, if the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gooners from <hi>Northampton</hi> or any else should assault them, upon notice given by jangling their Bells: And that the World might not think their fears to be groundless, on the 26 of <hi>December,</hi> 1642. at 12 of the Clock at Night, Captain <hi>Francis Sawyer</hi> (and as is supposed a Brother of Sir <hi>Gilber Pickerings</hi>) attended by a 100 Dragoons, beset Mr. <hi>Grayes</hi> House; and the signal of jangling the Bells being discovered by some of the Town that were of their faction, to prevent the Alarm to the Country, they tie up the Bell-ropes, and place a Guard of twelve Musqueteers in the Church-yard, to secure the passage to the Belfrey: Having thus beset the House, and as they thought frustrated the device of calling the Confederate Villages to their help, Captain <hi>Sawyer</hi> demands entrance, Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> out of his Window, tells him that he and his Family were in Bed, and withal desired to know what their intentions were, thus in the dead of the night to disturb their rest, and what Warrant they had to command entrance? They return him answer
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103099:38"/>
that they had a Warrant to apprehend his Person, and seise on his Plate and Arms for the use of the Parliament: Half an hour was spent in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> protracting the time, that perhaps his Neighbours hearing of his danger, might come to his rescue: Which accordingly fell out, for some of the Town hearing that the Rebels had beset Mr. <hi>Grayes</hi> House, hasten towards the Church that by the sound of the Bells (the Signal agreed on) they might summon the Country: When they come thither, they find the way intercepted, a Guard of Musqueteers denying them entrance: but inraged to find opposition where they did not expect it, they fell foul on the Guard, beat them off, took five of their Musquets, forced their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and so rang the Bells. Hereupon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, fearing that their entrance was delayed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to gain time till the Town and Country might come in to his Rescue, brake open a Window, and put in one or two of their company, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently open the Doors to them and give them free entrance: Having thus possessed themselves of the House, their first work is to seise upon Mr. <hi>Graey</hi>'s Person, to this purpose they make directly to his Chamber, whom they found in his Shirt, and would hardly give him leave to put on his Clothes; and that their seising of his Person might not be without all shew of Authority, they produce a Warrant signed by the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> in which Mr. <hi>Gray</hi>'s name was, this they shew only, but will not permit them to read it. All the Monies and Plate which they found in the House they take away, and as for Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> himself having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him Prisoner, they compel him to go on foot from <hi>Wellingborow</hi> to <hi>Welby:</hi> While they are on
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103099:39"/>
their way towards <hi>Welby,</hi> some 40 or 50 men from <hi>Wellingborow,</hi> armed only with Swords and Staves, come to Rescue Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> from the Rebels: After a short Skirmish (wherein one or two of the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suers were hurt only, not slain) finding that they were unequal for the Rebels both in Number and Arms, leaving the Prey in the hands of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors, they retreat to <hi>Wellingborow:</hi> Being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned thither, they find Five hundred of the Country come in to their assistance: The common People (who seldom love or hate moderately) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged that Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> should thus be taken from them, especially some of his poor Neighbours, who in him were robbed of the relief which they received from his Charity, resolve to make some of the Rebels Faction in that Town sensible of their displeasure; and therefore since they cannot reek their anger on the Rebels that did the fact, they fall foul on those that did approve it, if they were not Abettors and underhand Contrivers of it: They break their Windows, break into some of their Houses, and spoil their Goods. Amongst the number of those that suffered under the fury of the People, a Chandler and a Cooper under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went the greatest Loss, yet it could not be much, since upon a strict survey, the whole spoil done in the Town did not amount to 30 <hi>l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many of this assembly, utterly disliking such disorders, did not only reprove the chief Actors in this Outrage, but to discountenance their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withdrew themselves: They of the Town to their Houses, they of the Country to their several Habitations; so that by the break of day the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult was appeased, and the Town cleared. While these things were in doing, the Cooper and one or

two with him post away to Mr. <hi>Perne,</hi> the Parson of <hi>Welby,</hi> a Turbulent and Seditious man, and make their complaint to him, and to inflame him that was too apt to kindle without their help, they do not only aggravate their own losses at <hi>Wellingborow,</hi> but tell him that they threatned to come and do the like at <hi>Welby:</hi> Mr. <hi>Perne</hi> (changing his black Coat for a gray) instantly goes to <hi>Northampton,</hi> and there represents the injury done to their Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at <hi>Wellingborow,</hi> and the pretended danger of <hi>Welby</hi> so effectually, that by Noon that Tuesday, Colonel <hi>Norwich</hi> commanding in chief, Sergeant-Major <hi>Mole,</hi> Captain <hi>John Sawyer,</hi> Captain <hi>Francis Sawyer,</hi> Captain <hi>Pertlow,</hi> Captain <hi>Redman,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Farmar,</hi> Captain <hi>Harrold,</hi> with 500, but others say 1000 Horses and Dragooners, came to <hi>Welling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borow:</hi> Being come thither, they divide themselves into several Troops, to make good several passages into the Town, thereby to keep out the Country that were coming to their aid, Captain <hi>John Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,</hi> with 80 or a 100 Dragooners enters the Town at that side which leads to <hi>Welby</hi>; and riding in the Front of his men marched directly towards Mr. <hi>Neile</hi> of <hi>Woollaston,</hi> and some few with him who stood to oppose him: <hi>Sawyer</hi> discharges at Mr. <hi>Neile,</hi> and whom he missed with his Bullet he would be sure to hit with his Tongue, shooting out Arrows, even bitter words, calling him <hi>Popish Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal:</hi> But what reward shall be given unto thee, O thou false Tongue? He staied not long without it, for the words were no sooner spoken, and (to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond his words) a charge given to his Soldiers to give fire, but he received what he would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, his deaths wound by a shot in the Head and Neck by Goose-shot, which made him fall on his

Horse-neck, which shot was seconded by a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man, who with a Club beat him off his Horse into the Dirt; being thus beaten down, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to revenge their Husbands Quarrel fasten on him, but Mr. <hi>Oliver Gray</hi> (Nephew to Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> before mentioned) and Mr. <hi>Woolaston</hi> rescued out of their hands, who otherwise had immediately died the death of <hi>Sisera,</hi> by the hands of Women: Reprieved thus for some few hours, they carry him to one <hi>Gray</hi>'s House an Alehouse-keeper, whose Wife was Captain <hi>Sawyers</hi> Aunt, where they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred what they could, but in vain, for after two and twenty hours Languishment he died: As soon as Captain <hi>Sawyer</hi> was fallen, his Soldiers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly ran away, only his Son, unwilling to leave his Father, followed him to the hazard of his life, by many Wounds which he received. In other P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rts of the Town, the Townsmen quit themselves like valiant Soldiers and loyal Subjects, and with very little help of the Country, kept the Rebels out: Mr. <hi>Gray</hi>'s man and another, with each man his Musquet, kept out above a 100 at the lower end of the Town, and repelled them twice or thrice; and had not Captain <hi>Sawyer</hi> coming to himself a little before his death, persuaded them that it was in vain to stand out, there being three Pieces on the way from <hi>Northampton,</hi> to Batter the Town (which proved true) and withal persuading them to write a Letter to the Commanders, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that upon their submission the Town should be secured, they had held it out to the last man: But the dying Captain prevailed with them, they write a Letter according to his advice, which as they say was signed by his own hand, the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of his desperate condition having put new
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103099:40"/>
thoughts in him. But this Resolution not being so fully made known to the Town, as a business of that concernment ought to have been, some of the Town, being ignorant of any Treaty, made some shot, and the Rebels willing to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, rush into the Town, put both those of the Town and Country to flight. Captain <hi>Francis Sawyer</hi> much inraged for his Brother, and coming near the place where his Brother was Wounded, seeing Mr. <hi>Flint</hi> the Curate of <hi>Harrowden</hi> stand there, not any way ingaged in the Resistance, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not given any provocation, he barbarously struck him with his Pole-Ax, and cleft his Head down to the Eyes, of which Wound he died in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly: The Earth drinking up that innocent Blood, shed by the hand of an accursed <hi>Doeg,</hi> which like the Blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> calls loud in the Ears of God for Vengeance upon them, who au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize and countenance such horrid Murthers; <hi>Cursed be his anger for it was fierce, and his wrath for it was cruel.</hi>

                  <p>Being masters of the Town, at three of the Clock in the Afternoon they begin to Plunder, and continue the Spoil until the next Day-light failed them, until Wednesday night.

From the other they took Goods, and other things, amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to a very great Sum: And to compleat their wickedness, to their Oppression they add Scorn; for having taken away all that they could, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision they affix Protections in writing under Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Norwich</hi> his hand, at his and some others doors, forbidding any man to Plunder.

                  <p>They took Mr. <hi>Neile</hi> Prisoner, and some Forty more, amongst them they took the Vicar, Master <hi>Jones,</hi> a grave and learned man, but lame and very sickly, and having Plundered him of all he had, they mount him on a poor Jade, with a Halter instead of a Bridle; the rest they tie two and two together, and drive them before them to <hi>Northampton.</hi> Mr. <hi>Gray,</hi> as I told you, was the day before led Prisoner to <hi>Welby,</hi> from thence to <hi>Northampton,</hi> where his Prison cannot afford him protection from the fury and rage of the Soldiers; to make way to his death, they threaten to pull down the House where he was confined: And the Commissioners finding that he could not remain there with any safety, were constrained to send

him away Prisoner to <hi>London.</hi> Being come thither, Articles are framed and exhibited against him, which being examined at a Committee, and no proof at all made, he was Voted to be discharged his Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment: yet to delude Justice, and the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> the Chair-man could never find a time to make his Report to the House, so that he remained a Prisoner for a long time.</p>

There is in the Castle a goodly fair Church, here they dig up the Graves, and disturb the ashes of the dead: they break down the ancient Monuments of the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doses,</hi> and instead thereof, leave a prodigious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of their Sacrilegious profaneness: for each part of the Church they find a peculiar way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane it: the lower part of it they make their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Chancel their Slaughter-house. Unto the Pulpit (which of all other places in probability might have escaped their Impiety) they fasten pegs to hang the Carcasses of the slaughtered Sheep: the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-Table, according to their own Language,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103099:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they make their Dresser or Chopping-board to cut out their meat; into the Vault, wherein lay the Bodies of the <hi>Chandoses,</hi> an ancient and honorable Family, they cast the guts and garbage: mingling the loathsom Intrals of Beasts, with those Bones and Ashes which did there rest in hope of a joyful Resurrection. The Nave or Body of the Church was all covered with the dung and blood of Beasts: and which was (if it be possible) a degree beyond these Profanations, in contempt of God and his holy Temple, they defile each part and corner both of Church and Chancel with their own Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and going away, left nothing behind them in the Church (besides Walls and Seats) but a stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Memory, that part of the Parliament Army raised for the defence of Religion, had been there. Let that railing <hi>Rabshekah,</hi> or jeering <hi>Sanballet,</hi> I mean the Author of the ridiculous Pamphlet, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>One Argument more against the Cavaliers,</hi> read this Story, and then tell me which are most guilty of prophanation of Churches, the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> or the <hi>Round-heads</hi>; which were most profaned, either St. <hi>Mary Maudlins</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> or the Church at <hi>Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Castle: and yet this Dog sticks not with <hi>Shimei</hi> to bark at his Sovereign and blaspheme his Piety, as if the Rebels brought from <hi>Cyrencester</hi> had been Quartered in this Church by his approbation, who to expiate that guilt, gave an hundred an fifty pounds to adorn and beautifie that Church.

but by the means of the late Lord <hi>Brooke,</hi> chosen Burgess of Parliament for <hi>Warwick,</hi> and who had the greatest Influence in seducing that unhappy Lord to this desperate Rebellion, in which he mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably perished:) did beat down and deface those Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of Antiquity; and not content with this, by the same Command they break down the Cross in the Market-place, not leaving one stone upon another, <hi>Purefey</hi> all the while standing by, anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and encouraging them, until they had finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their so barbarous Work.

Forces at <hi>Starton,</hi> it pleased the Commanders of His Majesties Forces to entertain thoughts of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency towards the remainder of the Rebels. To testifie to the World therefore, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more in their desires than a Thrift of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Blood, and withal, to heap <hi>coles of fire upon their heads,</hi> to conquer them by kindness whom they had often conquered by the sword: by their Letters they signifie their readiness to close up those wide rents between them, by a Treaty. And that a Message of Peace might be well suited with a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger, they sent the Letters by Dr. <hi>Cox,</hi> Doctor of Divinity, who, attended by a Trumpeter, came to <hi>Exeter</hi> that Sunday in the After-noon. The Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter, as the manner is, gave the Town warning, as soon as he came within sight of the Guard, and presently an Officer came to receive him, who blind-folding him with a Handkerchief pinn'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Eyes, conducted him through the City unto the Earl of <hi>Stamfords</hi> House: having admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance there, the Doctor takes off his Handkerchief, but accidentally did not dispose of the pin that fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, but still kept it in his Hand: the Earl had no sooner set his eyes upon the Doctor, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently he reviles him, and calls him all the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Names he could imagine, and swore that he would hang him instantly: but first, to extort a confession from him, he offers a Knife or Dagger to his Breast, demanding an answer to some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories: the Doctor not affrighted with such rough usage, replies very discreetly, That he had received commands to deliver certain Letters from the Commanders of the <hi>Cornish,</hi> to those of the <hi>Devonshire</hi> Army, but that he had no Commission to satisfie any different and by-demands; this denial
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103099:44"/>
to answer, <hi>together with after dinner,</hi> inflamed the Earl, and put him into a new fit of Railing: and for variety sake he did intermix the opprobrious names, with many menaces and offers of stabbing him: In the end, seeing that this harsh welcome could effect nothing, nor awe the Doctor to make any discovery, he demands the Letters: the Doctor, that he might clear his hands, and so dive into his Pockets suddenly, put the Pin which he held in his hands between his lips: hereupon one <hi>Baxter,</hi> a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant-Major of the City, observing the motion of his hand, but not perceiving what it conveyed to his mouth, cryed out, <hi>What doth the rogue eat there? he swallows Papers of Intelligence</hi>: With this the Earl, forgetting the Gravity and serious Deportment of a Peer of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> began in an antick manner to leap, and skip, and frisk, crying out, <hi>Treason, Treason, he comes to betray the City, Courage my brave blades</hi>: and so turning to the Doctor, he set his Dagger again to his Breast, and demanded what it was that he had put into his mouth? The Doctor mildly and softly putting his hands to his lips, took the Pin thence, and shewing it to his Lordship, said, <hi>It is a Pin, my Lord.</hi> The Serjeant-Major thinking to intercept the supposed <hi>Intelligence</hi> going down the Doctors throat, instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flies to him, took him by the throat, and griped him so hard, that he had almost strangled him. The Earl himself (most unworthily) crying out, <hi>Cut the Villains throat, cut it</hi>: nor did he command an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, what he would not do himself, for with his own hands he offered his Knife thrice at the Doctors throat to cut it, but the Doctor still put it by, God, who is <hi>a present help in trouble,</hi> restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Earl, and delivered the Doctor out of his
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103099:44"/>
hands. Nor was it his hap to suffer from Honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hands only, the standers by are not idle, but follow so leading an example: as if he had been sent for from <hi>Cornwall</hi> to <hi>Exeter</hi> on no other errand than to be made the City scorn, and the subject whereon their wanton insolency should vent it self: every one in the Room had a fling at him: some with their fists beat him about the head; others scratch his face; one with his fingers boars his ears, to his extream torment another with his fingers rakes in his mouth, hoping there to find some Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of <hi>Intelligence</hi>: one tears his hair, another forces his hand down his throat, and the thing for which they make this strict search, is <hi>Intelligence,</hi> some scrole of <hi>Intelligence:</hi> Sure there is much want of <hi>Intelligence</hi> in their own heads, that made such strict inquisition for it in another mans. Well, this pursuit of <hi>Intelligence</hi> so long they continue, and so eagerly, that the Doctor fainting under so barbarous usage, was ready to give up the Ghost, and for fear he should dye under their hands, they leave him a sad emblem of that entertainment which the Messengers of Peace find from the men of this Generation. Let that rebellious City remember and tremble at that condolement of our Saviour over the like sin: <hi>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the Prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee.</hi> I am unwilling to go on and read her destiny, and therefore shall return to the story.</p>
                  <p>Having in this unchristian manner insulted long enough upon the Doctor, they divert their rage, and spend the rest of their Fury on the Trumpeter; and having either before, in part breathed out their madness, or not thinking the poor Trumpeter so Malignant as the Doctor, though they used him
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103099:45"/>
bad enough, yet they express not so keen a malice against him as against the Doctor. Having satiated themselves by cumulating Injury upon Injury up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, they are both commanded to an outward Room; here they are assaulted by fresh Furies, for they had not staid long there, but two Aldermen renew the same Insolencies, and act the Injuries all over again, and the very dregs of the People animated by their example, bear them Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. After this, the Earl commits them to Prison, and being brought into the Room where they were to lodge, they were stript naked, and their Cloaths narrowly searched: and though after all this scrutiny nothing could be found, yet <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> is the thing the Earl looks after, and <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> he will have if it be to be had. And though the World never took his Lordship for a Physitian, yet he prescribes two Vomits, where his Honour had his <hi>Simples,</hi> I know not, but the Composition was of a green colour, divided into two Draughts, put into two Bowls, these the Earl commands to be administred to the Doctor and the Trumpeter, that so they may vomit up those supposed Papers of <hi>Intelligence,</hi> which Serjeant-Major <hi>Baxter</hi> thought they had swallowed: the Doctor, the chief Patient, begins first, whom instantly they ply with Posset-drink, having likewise some infusion in it to provoke and help on the Potion taken: all night long did they keep the Doctor at this Exercise, though they saw that what came from him, came with great difficulty and torment, yet they gave not off, till at last it drew Blood from him: all the return that was made into the Basin, was very exactly strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to see if there were any rag of <hi>Intelligence</hi>: but there was none: but in case it should work both
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103099:45"/>
ways (though his Lordship had many about him wonderous fit for such Imployment) yet whom he placed Sentinel for the Postern, if any <hi>Intelligence</hi> should chance to escape that way, my intelligence fails me. This Inhumane usage brought the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor so low, that in three days he was not able to receive any Sustenance. In this his extremity and weakness, he had many visits from the people of the Town, who like <hi>Jobs</hi> comforters, revile him instead of pitying him: and the third night, as he lay very sick and weak in his Bed, there came into his Chamber a man very likely to prove the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger of death unto him; his name was <hi>Doune,</hi> Lieutenant to Captain <hi>White,</hi> who presently asking for the Jesuite, and calling him Rogue, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny base names as himself deserved, offered to lay violent hands upon him: but one of the Soldiers abhorring so barbarous Cruelty, in meer mercy to a dying Man, as he had reason to judge him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposing, restrained him from acting those Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous thoughts which he brought with him. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Doctor had remained Prisoner five or six days, and having recovered so much strength as to hold out another worrying, he was (with an ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in some) brought before the Council of War, where, upon the Doctors complaint of the hard usage he had undergon, some of the prime Gentry being ashamed of the Cruelties acted on him, being a Messenger, and in that regard by the Law of Arms ought to be priviledged from all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts, much more from such violent Outrages, Sir <hi>John Northcoote</hi> indeavoured to palliate the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and to take off from the odiousness of it, by alledging the Contents of the Letters, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed being for some Preparatories and Overtures
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:103099:46"/>
of Peace, might inrage these men that were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies unto it: To which the Doctor replyed, that under favour that could be no ground, nor yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for their savage usage of him; because they had beaten him, and almost murdered him in the Earl of <hi>Stamfords</hi> presence, before they knew the Contents of the Letters, or read so much as one syllable of them, or indeed received them, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Serjeant-Major seizing on him before he could deliver them: This so unanswerable a return, put the Knight to his <hi>Italian</hi> shrug, and rejoyned no more, but <hi>I know not That.</hi> After a Week (and more) Imprisonment, the Earl commands the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor to be carryed aboard the <hi>Hope of Toptham,</hi> where the stench and noysom smell of the Ship had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most poyson'd him. The Doctors Wife hearing of her Husbands Imprisonment, came to <hi>Exeter</hi> to see him; but before she came her Husband being Shipt for <hi>London,</hi> on much intreaty she obtained leave to go on Ship-board to see him; but on her return, she was Imprisoned till her Husband being under Sail, she had liberty to go away. After ten days being at Sea, the Doctor arrived at <hi>London,</hi> where he was long detained Prisoner at the Lord <hi>Peters</hi> his House in <hi>Aldersgate-street.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> with some other Rebels under his Conduct, came to Mr. <hi>Nowels</hi> House, Brother to the Lord <hi>Nowel</hi> that now is, demanding his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son prisoner, and his Arms for the use of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. Master <hi>Nowell</hi> modestly replyed, That he knew not wherein he had offended, that he should forfeit his Liberty or Goods to the Justice of the Parliament: his House was his Castle, his Arms were his Defence, and his Liberty was precious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; so that he could not satisfie their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:103099:46"/>
in any thing. Hereupon they plant a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non very near the House, so near, that the Fire of it took hold of an Out-house that was thatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; this House, though burnt down, was not of any great consequence. Therefore they discharge again, and beat down a beam of his Dwelling-house, but hurt no man within it: and making a third shot, they beat down a Chimney, and the fall of it bruis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the foot of one of his Servants. At last, finding that Mr. <hi>Nowel</hi> was resolved to make good his house against them, notwithstanding their Cannon Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and would not deliver up his Person to Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, nor his House to their Plunder, they fire six of his Neighbors Houses; in one of which there was a Woman in Labor, by which means the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors were compelled to expose her to a probable, by snatching her from a certain destruction; for in the midst of her Throws and Pangs of Child-birth, they were fain to carry her in a Chair out into the Streets: having a while sported and warmed themselves at those Flames, at which the poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants wept and wrung their Hands, they threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, that unless Mr. <hi>Nowel</hi> will yield himself Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, and deliver up his House to their pleasure, they will not only fire his House, but will not leave a House unburnt in the whole Parish. This so affrighted the poor Inhabitants his Neighbors, that Men, Women and Children, come with tears, and earnestly beseech him to surrender himself, rather than suffer them to be ruined, and utterly spoiled before his face. Overcome at last, not by the Rebels Ordnance, but by that which spake loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in his Ears, the pitiful complaints and out-cries of his Neighbors, he founds a Parley, the result of which was:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:103099:47"/>First, <hi>That the Rebels should see the Fire quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That all in his house should have liberty to depart whither they pleased.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>That none should enter the House but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this generation of <hi>Truce-breakers</hi> (that keep Faith neither with God nor man, and break Oaths faster then ever <hi>Sampson</hi> did his Cords, whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can tye fast but a Halter, the strongest Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation for a Traytor) were no sooner entred the House, but presently they seize on Master <hi>Nowell</hi> and Master <hi>Skipwith</hi> as their Prisoners: and whereas by the Article of agreement, none were to enter the House but Commanders; and since, if the Article had been kept unviolated, there were like to be as many Thieves within as without doors; Therefore Commanders and Common Souldiers, Common Souldiers and Commanders, all Thieves, enter the House and rifle it. They take away his Goods, cut the Ticks of his Beds, burn the Feathers, tear in pieces his Accounts, Writings, and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and <hi>That</hi> which we have not read in the black Catalogue of the outrages of the Rebellious Irish, was attempted by these; for in the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations upon Oath of those that report the miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Sufferings of the poor Protestants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the barbarousness of the <hi>Irish,</hi> published by Order of Parliament, we do not find that God gave them up to so roprobate a sense, as to commit or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any Rapes; give the Devil his due, this sin we find not laid to their charge: But these blessed Reformers, whom they have not blushed blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously to call, <hi>The Host of God,</hi> and <hi>Christs Armies,</hi> and <hi>Champions of Religion,</hi> added this to the rest of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103099:47"/>
their innumerable Wickednesses, That they attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to ravish two of his Maid-servants; one was dumb, but fourteen years of age; another had her knee put out of joint, striving to resist a Villain in so Beastly an attempt. In a word, their practices were generally so Wicked, so Impious, that one that stood Spectator of all passages, and observed strictly what was done, affirms, That Mr. <hi>Griffith</hi> (whom some call Prince <hi>Griffith</hi>) was the only ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized Man amongst them. Having committed these Inhumane Acts among the Living, they go into the Church among the Dead, and there deface a goodly Monument, which this noble Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Nowell,</hi> had erected for his deceased Wife: deeply wounding the living Husband, by spoiling that Memorial which he had consecrated to the dear memory of his dead Wife. Having ransacked all from the living to the dead, they carry away Mr. <hi>Nowell</hi> and Mr. <hi>Skipwith</hi> Prisoners to <hi>London,</hi> and commit them to safe Custody in the Lord <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> his House (before mentioned) in <hi>Aldersgate street,</hi> where they remained Prisoners for a long time.</p>
                  <p>Colonel <hi>Sandyes,</hi> in his perambulation of <hi>Kent,</hi> bestowed a Visit upon Dr. <hi>Bargraves</hi> House, then Dean of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Dean himself then being from home. <hi>Sandyes</hi> came late in the Night, and the whole Family were in Bed: they soon raise the House, and where they did not find they make an entrance, forcing Mistris <hi>Bargrave,</hi> a virtuous good Gentlewoman (whom their hasty Summons had permitted to cast only her Night-gown about her) to wait upon them from room to room, not suffering her to turn aside (though she for Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty sake requested that favour at their hands) to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:103099:48"/>
draw on her Stockings, unless they might stand by and see it done. They rudely rush into Mistris <hi>Boys</hi> her Chamber, the Widow of Dr. <hi>Boys</hi> Dean of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> a Gentlewoman about fourscore years old, there they seize upon a Cabinet of hers, and break it open, (though the good Old woman would very fain have had it spared, and offered them the Key to open it) they find in it forty five pounds in Old Gold, which she had laid by to bestow as Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies upon her Friends: this they hug and call their own. She intreats them to forbear it, and directs them to her Will which was laid up with the Gold, and in that they might see how she had bequeathed it. Upon perusal of the Will, they find that she had made Dean <hi>Bargrave,</hi> her own Brother, her Executor; this they pronounce a Crime of so high a nature, that nothing could expiate the guilt, but the forfeiture of the Gold, and the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling of the Will; but by the earnest mediation of Mr. <hi>King,</hi> one of their Company, at length they are perswaded to restore the Gold, and spare the Will. From hence they go to the Chamber where young Mr. <hi>Bargrave</hi> the Deans son did lodge; <hi>Sandys</hi> valiantly breaks his Sword (which hung at his Beds-head) before his face, and calling him out of his Bed, sends him Prisoner to <hi>Dover-Castle.</hi> Soon after, the Dean hastning home to comfort his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed Family, <hi>Sandys</hi> hears where he was lodged at an Inne at <hi>Graves-end,</hi> and as he was undressed and ready to go into Bed, <hi>Sandys,</hi> and thirteen of his Souldiers, press into his Chamber with their Swords drawn, and command him to yield himself a Prisoner; which the Dean (having neither power nor will to resist) did accordingly; having (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reason given) brought him a Captive to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:103099:48"/>
                     <hi>London,</hi> they commit him Prisoner to the <hi>Fleet</hi> where after he had lain three weeks, he was at last released, without ever being examined, or so much as called to the House. After this <hi>Sandys</hi> writes (I blush to mention so degenerous a Pamphlet) a Book, and was not ashamed to call it, <hi>His Travels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Kent,</hi> unworthy his Predecessors, to strain the name of <hi>Sandyes</hi> with such Travels: In this worthless Commentary, the Register of his perpetual Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; amongst other things he fastens the Note of a debauched drunken young Fellow, upon young Mr. <hi>Bargrave,</hi> a Gentleman of so ingenuous a Countenance, so modest and sweet a Temper, that he deserves a far better Character. The old Dean, a Grave and learned Gentleman, heart-broken with these Injuries, soon after dyes; the World in the mean time Condemning <hi>Sandyes,</hi> not so much for his Barbarity, as Ingratitude in dealing thus with him, who had not many years before, been a special means to save him from the Gallows, when he was Indicted for a Rape at the General Affizes at <hi>Maydstone.</hi> But you know the old Proverb, <hi>Save a Thief from the Gallows, and he will cut your Throat.</hi>

                  <p>WHen the Earl of <hi>Stamford</hi> was in <hi>Hereford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> in <hi>October</hi> 1642. and pillaged all that kept Faith and Allegeance to the King, informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was given to Mistris <hi>Swift,</hi> Wife of Mr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Swift</hi> Parson of <hi>Goodwich,</hi> that her House was designed to be plundered: To prevent so great a danger, she instantly repaired to <hi>Hereford</hi> where the Earl then was, some ten miles from her own home, to Petition him, that no violence might be offered by his Soldiers to her House or Goods: He most nobly, and according to the goodness of his Disposition, threw the Petition away, and swore no small Oaths, That she should be plundered to morrow. The good Gentlewoman, being out of hope to prevail, and seeing there was no good to be done by Petitioning him, speeds home as fast as she could, and that Night removed as much of her Goods, as the shortness of the time would permit: next Morning, to make good the Earl of <hi>Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi> word, Captain <hi>Kirle</hi>'s Troop, consisting of seventy Horse, and thirty Foot which were hangers
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:103099:49"/>
on, (Birds of prey) came to Mr. <hi>Swifts</hi> house; there they took away all his provision of Victuals, Corn, Houshold-stuff, which was not conveyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: they empty his Beds, and fill the Ticks with Malt; they rob him of his Cart and six Horses, and make this part of their Theft the means to convey away the rest: Mistris <hi>Swift</hi> much affrighted to see such a sight as this, thought it best to save her self though she lost her Goods; therefore taking up a young Child in her arms, began to secure her self by flight; which one of the Troopers perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he commanded her to stay, or (holding his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol at her Breast) threatned to shoot her dead: she (good woman) fearing death whether she went on or returned; at last, shunning that death which was next unto her, she retires back to her House, where she saw her self undone, and yet durst not oppose or ask why they did so? having thus rifled the House, and gone, next morning early she goes again to <hi>Hereford,</hi> and there again Petitions the Earl to shew some compassion on her and her ten Children, and that he would be pleased to cause her Horses and some part of her Goods to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored unto her: the good Earl was so far from granting her Petition, that he would not vouch-safe so much as to read it: when she could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail her self, she makes use of the mediation of Friends: these have the repulse too, his Lordship remaining inexorable without any inclination to mercy: at last, hoping that all mens hearts were not Adamant, relentless, she leaves the Earl, and makes her Address to Captain <hi>Kirle,</hi> who, upon her earnest intreaty, grants her a Protection for what was left, but for restitution, there was no hope of that; this Protection cost her no less than
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:103099:50"/>
thirty shillings: It seems Paper and Ink are dear in those parts. And now thinking her self secured by this Protection, she returns home, in hope that what was left she might injoy in peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: She had not been long at home, but Captain <hi>Kirle</hi> sends her word, that if it pleased her, she might buy four of her own six horses again, assuring her by his Fathers Servant and Tenant, that she should not fear being Plundered of them any more by the Earl of <hi>Stamfords</hi> Forces while they were in those parts. Encouraged by these promises, she was content to buy her own, and deposited eight pound ten shillings for four of her Horses. And now conceiving the Storm to be blown over, and all danger past, and placing much confidence in her purchas'd protection, she causeth all her Goods, secured in her Neighbors Houses, to be brought home; and since it could not be better, rejoiced that she had not lost all. She had not injoyed these thoughts long, but Captain <hi>Kirle</hi> sent unto her for some Vessels of Cyder, whereof having tasted, but not liking it, since he could not have Drink for himself, he would have Provender for his Horse; and therefore instead of Cyder, he demands ten Bushels of Oats. Mistris <hi>Swift</hi> fearing that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial might give some ground of a Quarrel, sent him word, that her Husband had not two Bushels of Oats in a year for Tythe, nor did they sow any on their Gleab: both which were most true: yet to shew how willing she was (to her power) to comply with him, that the Messenger might not return empty, she sent him forty shillings to buy Oats. Suddenly after, the Captain of <hi>Goodrige Castle,</hi> sends to Mr. <hi>Swifts</hi> house for Victual and Corn; Mistris <hi>Swift</hi> instantly repairs to him, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103099:50"/>
shews him her Protection: He, to answer shew with shew, shews her his Warrant, and so without any regard to her Protection, seizeth upon that Provision which was in the House, together with the Cyder which Captain <hi>Kirle</hi> refused. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mistris <hi>Swift</hi> writes to Captain <hi>Kirle,</hi> complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Injury, and the Affront done to him in slighting his Protection: But before the Messenger could return with an Answer to her Letter, some from the Castle come a second time to plunder the House, and they did what they came for: Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after comes a Letter from Captain <hi>Kirle</hi> in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to Mistris <hi>Swifts,</hi> telling her, That the Earl of <hi>Stamford</hi> did by no means approve of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries done unto her; and withal, by word of mouth, sends to her for more Oats: She perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that as long as she gave, they would never leave asking, resolved to be drill'd no more: the Return not answering Expectation; on the third of <hi>December,</hi> two hours before day, Captain <hi>Kirles</hi> Lieutenant, attended by a considerable number of Horse and Dragoons, comes to M. <hi>Swifts</hi> House and demands entrance; but the doors being kept shut against them, and not able to force them, they broke down two Iron Bars in a Stone Window, and so with Swords drawn and Pistols cocked, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the House. Being entred, they take all Master <hi>Swift</hi> and his Wives Apparel, his Books and his Childrens cloaths, they being in Bed; and those poor Children that hung by their Cloaths, unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with them, they swung them about, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til (their hold-fast failing) they dashed them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Walls. They took away all his Servants cloaths, and made so clean work with one, that they left him not a Shirt to cover his Nakedness.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103099:51"/>
There was one of the Children, an Infant lying in the Cradle, they rob'd that, and left not the little poor Soul a rag to defend it from the cold. They took away all the Iron, Pewter and Brass, and a very fair Cup-board of Glasses, which they could not carry away, they broke to pieces: and the four Horses lately redeemed, are with them lawful prize again, and left nothing of all the Goods but a few stools for his Wife, Children and Servants, to fit down and bemoan their distressed Condition. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away all, and being gone, Mistris <hi>Swift,</hi> in compassion to her poor Infant in the Cradle, took it up almost starved with cold, and wrapped it in a Petty-coat which she took off from her self: and now hoped, that having nothing to lose would be a better protection for their Persons, than that which she purchased of Captain <hi>Kirle</hi> for thirty shillings. But as if <hi>Jobs</hi> Messenger would never make an end, her three Maid-servants, whom they of the Castle had compelled to carry the Poultry to the Castle, return and tell their Mistris, that they in the Castle said, That they had a Warrant to seize upon Mistris <hi>Swift,</hi> and bring her into the Castle; and that they would make her three Maid-servants wait on her there, <hi>threatning to plunder all under the Petty-coat</hi>; and other uncivil immodest words, not fit for them to speak, or me to write. Hereupon Mistris <hi>Swift</hi> fled to the place where her Husband, for fear of the Rebels, had withdrawn himself: She had not been gone two hours, but they come from the Castle, and bring with them three Teems, to carry away what was before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for Plunder, but wanted means of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. When they came, amongst other things, there was a Batch of Bread hot in the Oven, this
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103099:51"/>
they seize on, Ten Children on their knees intreat but for one Loaf, and at last with much importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty obtained it: but before the children had eaten it, they took even that one Loaf away, and left them destitute of a morsel of Bread amongst ten Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Ransacking every corner of the house, that nothing might be left behind, they find a small Pewter dish, in which the dry Nurse had put Pap to feed the poor Infant, the Mother which gave it suck being fled to save her Life, this they seize on too. The Nurse intreats, for Gods sake, that they would spare that, pleading, that in the Mothers ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence it was all the sustenance which was or could be provided to sustain the life of the Child, and on her knees intreated to shew mercy unto the Child, that <hi>knew not the right hand from the left,</hi> a motive which prevailed with God himself, though justly incensed against <hi>Nineveh.</hi> But to shew what Bowels of Compassion and Mercy are to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Sectaries, and how far they are from being Disciples to him who says, <hi>Be ye merciful, as your Father which is in heaven is merciful.</hi> They trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress that precept of our Saviour <hi>in the Letter,</hi> and take away the Childrens meat and give it unto dogs; for throwing the Pap to the dogs, they put up the dish as lawful prize.</p>
                  <p>Master <hi>Swifts</hi> eldest son, a youth, seeing this barbarous cruelty, demanded of them a reason of this so hard usage: they replyed, That his Father was a Traitor to the King and Parliament, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that they would keep them so short, that they should eat the very Flesh from their Arms; and to make good their word, they threaten the Miller, that if he ground any Corn for these Children, they would grind him in his own Mill; and not content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103099:52"/>
with this, they go to Mr. <hi>Swifts</hi> next Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour (whose daughter was his Servant) and take him Prisoner, they examine him upon oath what goods of Mr. <hi>Swifts</hi> he had in his custody, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing that he had none, they charge him to take his daughter away from Mr. <hi>Swifts</hi> service, or else they threaten to Plunder him, and to make sure work they make him give them security to obey all their commands: terrified with this, the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours stand afar off, and pity the distressed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of these persecuted Children, but dare not come or send to their relief: by this means the Children and Servants had no sustenance, hardly any thing to cover them, from Friday six a clock at night, until Saturday twelve at night, until at last the Neighbours moved with the lamentable cryes and complaints of the Children and Servants, one of the Neighbours over-looking all difficulties, and shewing that he durst be charitable in despite of these Monsters, ventured in and brought them some provision. And if the World would know what it was that so exasperated these Rebels against this Gentleman, the Earl of <hi>Stamford,</hi> a man that is not bound to give an account of all his actions, gave two reasons for it, First, because he had bought arms and conveyed them into <hi>Monmouth-shire,</hi> which under his Lordships good favour was not so; and secondly, because not before, he preached a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in <hi>Rosse</hi> upon that Text, <hi>Give unto Caesar the things that are Caesars,</hi> in which his Lordship said, he had spoken Treason in endeavouring to give <hi>Caesar</hi> more than his due: these two Crimes cost Mr. <hi>Swift</hi> no less than 300 <hi>l.</hi>

                  <p>About <hi>Feb.</hi> 1642. the Duke of <hi>Vendosme</hi> being to return home into <hi>France,</hi> but resolving first to take
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103099:52"/>
his leave of the King at <hi>Oxford,</hi> obtained a Pass from the close Committee, that he might be free from any let or molestation in his journey, but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this Pass, in his return from <hi>Oxford</hi> he was searched and plundered at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> by that worthy Knight Sir <hi>Samuel Luke,</hi> who was sent by his Excellency from <hi>Windsor,</hi> with a Troop of Horse for that purpose, That <hi>France</hi> by experience might know that Thieves rob as confidently in the Towns of <hi>England,</hi> as in the woods of <hi>Ardenna,</hi> or any For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About <hi>December</hi> 1642. the Collonels <hi>Waller, Brown,</hi> and others marching from <hi>Ailesbury</hi> to <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,</hi> and thence by <hi>Newbury</hi> to <hi>Winchester,</hi> their Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in the March Plundered every Minister with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in five miles of the Road, without distinction whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their own party, or of the other, whether they subscribed for Episcopacy, Presbytery, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency, whether they wore a Surpless, or refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it; only if they did not, they afforded them the less booty. Those that were Confiders, whose Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity, and Non-Conformity, armed them with confidence to appear, Petitioned the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons for Relief and satisfaction: it being taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Consideration that this was not according to their new Phrase to <hi>weaken the wicked,</hi> but the Righteous and such who stood well affected to the Parliament: hereupon slandering the Cavaliers, with the fact which their own Soldiers had done, and to make the <hi>foolish Citizens bleed free,</hi> there was an Order drawn up and published, That in regard the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners were well-affected men, and Plundered by the Cavaliers, that there should be a general Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made for them the next Fast-day, and that the Preachers should exhort the People, and pray

to God to enlarge the Peoples hearts, bountifully to relieve the Petitioners.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Winchester</hi> being surprized, and the Lord <hi>Grandison</hi> taken Prisoner, Collonel <hi>Brown</hi> in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to famous <hi>Isaac Pennington,</hi> magnifies the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and inlarged the glory of it very much by that Circumstance of taking that Noble Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner; but which did much eclipse the honor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that day, in the Letter he adds, that by the Treachery of Colonel <hi>Urrey,</hi> he was escaped: little <hi>Isaac</hi> had hardly so much patience, as to read out the Letter, but he summons his <hi>Mirmidons,</hi> and gives an Alarm to his Red-coats, the Messengers of his Fury, and sends them instantly to plunder Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris <hi>Urries</hi> Lodging: it was no sooner said than done, they being as swift to act mischief as <hi>Isaac</hi> was ready to command it; what they had in charge they perform faithfully, and Plunder her of no more but all. Mistris <hi>Urrey</hi> presently gives notice to her Husband what measure she found in the City, while he was in their Service in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: the Colonel, upon the Information hastens to <hi>London,</hi> to expostulate for this Injury, and for redress, complains to the House against the Ring-leader <hi>Brown,</hi> and Rout-master <hi>little Isaac</hi>: upon hearing both Parties, the House quits Colonel <hi>Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey</hi> from any conspiracy with my Lord <hi>Grandison,</hi> or connivance at his escape: and for reparation of his Losses, they order him 400 <hi>l.</hi> to be paid him out of the Monies collected the last Fast-day for the Plundered Ministers, who by this means were Plundered twice: and so one Order begetting an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, they Order, That a new Collection shall be made for the Petitioners the next Fast-day: nor was this the first Debt by many that have been paid by

                  <p>The sixth Weeks <hi>Mercury</hi> told you of the Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of <hi>Wellingborow</hi> in <hi>Northampton-shire</hi> by the Rebels, and the taking of Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> Vicar of that Town, Prisoner; and in that account which I there gave of him, I left him in Captivity at <hi>Northampton</hi>: since that <hi>Mercury</hi> went abroad, some good Body finding that Relation to come far short of that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous usage which Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> found from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, moved either with detestation of such inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Cruelty, not to be buryed in Oblivion, or out of affection to his Person murdered by these savage
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103099:54"/>
Monsters, hath supplied the former defect, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled me to bring this Story to its sad conclusion-</p>
                  <p>Master <hi>Jones</hi> was a man very aged, being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at that Term which <hi>Moses</hi> made the usual boundary of mans life in his time, <hi>Threescore and ten</hi>; and had not these blood-thirsty men short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his dayes by an untimely death, he might have been so strong as to <hi>come to fourscore years:</hi> And though age it self be a disease (which yet few men that have it are willing to be cured of) it pleased God to add a casual infirmity to his natural; for some two years since by a fall he unhappily broke his leg, of which he continued lame to his death. When the Rebels, those Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs that devour all the good things of the Land, came to <hi>Wellingborow,</hi> having ransacked the Town, they took many Prisoners, and amongst the rest Master <hi>Jones:</hi> all that knew him must bear him record, that he was a man of a most unblamable life and conversation, an able Scholar, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily gifted for Preaching, of which he gave ample proof by his Labours diligently bestowed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his Parishoners by the space of Forty years: having <hi>him</hi> in their power <hi>whom</hi> they knew to be a great means by his Orthodox Preaching to keep that Town, and some parts thereabouts in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when the rest of the Country were in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion against their Sovereign, they neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence his calling, nor honour his age, nor pity his infirmity, but abuse him by scoffs and jeers, and compel him to go on foot a great part of the way (lame and weak as he was) between <hi>Wellingborow</hi> and <hi>Northampton:</hi> and that he might keep pace with the rest, they compel him to make more speed than his infirmity could brook. At <hi>Wellingborow</hi>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:103099:55"/>
the Rebels murthered a Barber and stole away his Bear; and when they could not force this reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend old man to mend his pace, Lieutenant <hi>Grimes</hi> (a desperate Brownist, the Master of this misrule, and the chief agent in inflicting all this scorn and tyranny on Master <hi>Jones,</hi> but since a Prisoner in <hi>Banbury</hi> Castle) to see if fear would add to his strength, forceth the Bear upon him, which run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning between his legs, took him upon her back, and laying aside the untractableness of its Nature, grew patient of her burthen; and to the astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the beholders carried him quietly, so that what was intended as a violence, became his ease. The Rebels overcome by so unusual an example of kindness, the savage Bear <hi>reproving the madness</hi> of their fury, they remove Master <hi>Jones</hi> from off the Bear to a Horse, but such a Horse as did but vary, not better the condition of his Transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. One of the rout observed to be extreamly active in all these insolencies, and to have a hand in murthering the Barber, seing the tameness of the Bear, as quiet under Master <hi>Jones,</hi> as if she had been accustomed to the Saddle, presumes that it was <hi>no more but up and ride,</hi> and presently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strides the Bear, who as if she had been of that race that did revenge the Prophet <hi>Elisha</hi>'s quarrel, dismounts the bold Rider, and as if she had been robbed of her Whelps, did so mangle, rend, and tear him with her teeth and pawes, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous Wretch died of these hurts suddenly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>Stay, Reader, suspend thy opinion, be not too hasty, I profess ingenuously the relation seems at first blush to partake something of the <hi>Romanse,</hi> or at best to be but an imitation of some Popish

Legend, as if we meant to implore the help of feigned miracles to gain credit to a party: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all this prejudice I must oppose, first, the integrity and quality of the Relator, being beyond all exception, and affirms it on his credit. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, why may not God stop and open the mouth of the Bear now as well as the Lions heretofore? or revenge the indignities offered to a Minister under the Gospel, by the same creature, as those offered to a Prophet under the Law? Or lastly, why may not the blood of him that owned this Beast, be required by this Beast of him that had his hand in shedding it? This was not the first time that God gave commission to the Brute to execute his vengeance. But I forget my self; my business is to relate things done, not to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Objections against their probability of doing. To go on therefore.</p>
                  <p>Having brought Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> to <hi>Northampton,</hi> his entertainment there was as bad as his usage in the way thither; though it were in the depth of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when old age needed good fortifications of Lodging and Diet against the incursions of cold and wet, yet they afforded him nothing but a hard mat, with a little straw under him, and to cover him and to keep him warm nothing but one blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and his own wearing cloaths: As for his food, they give him the <hi>Bread of Affliction,</hi> denying his own friends leave to supply him with competent diet, to sustein nature, and his growing infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: yet to shew that <hi>Man lives not by bread only, but by every word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God,</hi> it pleased his good providence to preserve him like the <hi>young Children</hi> in <hi>Daniel, fed only with Pulse,</hi> so that he was in good plight, and semed
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103099:56"/>
to want nothing, though he continued in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed condition from Christmas to almost Easter: about which time, not remorse of conscience for so much cruelty practised on a decrepid old man, (but an Orthodox Reverend Divine) but impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of friends, prevailed with the Rebels to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease him of his imprisonment in <hi>Northampton,</hi> and to remit him to a neighbour Minister of his, one Mr. <hi>Walters,</hi> Bachelor in Divinity, Vicar of <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington</hi> near <hi>Wellingborow,</hi> a very learned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious Preacher, and permitted him to Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in his own Cure at Easter, there being but one Parish Church in the Town, but no less than two thousand Communicants. Having licence to visit his Charge, not awed by that tyrannous u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage which he had undergone, Conscience of his duty doth press him to a punctual observance of the Orders and Canons of the Church: he ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrates Divine Service according to the Book of Common Prayer; preacheth Obedience as bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as if there had been no Rebels in <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonshire,</hi> administreth the Sacraments with the same Reverence, Decency and Devotion, as if there had been no Puritans in <hi>Wellingborow.</hi> Nor doth the undaunted old man remit any thing enjoyned by Canon or Rubrick. This constancy of his so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed the Schismatical Puritanical Party of the Town, that complaint is made at <hi>Northampton,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> is the same man he was, as much a true Son and Minister of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as ever. Upon this information, he is apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Easter week, and carried Prisoner to <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton</hi> a second time, where they use him with more inhumanity (if it be possible) than before; they will not permit his Wife to visit him and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:103099:56"/>
kept him so short in his diet, not suffering his Wife or friends to relieve him, that most barbarously they starved him to death, for about Whitsontide his spirits exhausted, and his body pined by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, the good old Martyr resigned his Soul to God.</p>
                  <p>There is in <hi>Northampton</hi> one <hi>John Gifford,</hi> for his extraction the Hog-herds Son of <hi>Little-Houg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> for his education, a <hi>Knitter,</hi> afterwards a <hi>Hose-buyer,</hi> now Mayor of <hi>Northampton,</hi> and Colonel of the Town Regiment. This man to his power Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Martial assumes an Ecclesiastical Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendency too, and orders what forms shall be used in <hi>Baptism, the Lords Supper, Burial of the Dead,</hi> and the like: When therefore they came to interr the skin and bones of this starved Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, for flesh he had none, the form enjoyned by this <hi>Gifford</hi> was the same which one <hi>Brooks,</hi> a <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> Lecturer, used at the burial of <hi>John Gough</hi> of S. <hi>James Dukes Place</hi> within <hi>Aldgate</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> viz.</p>

                  <p>Before I leave this particular Relation, I must not forget to tell you one act of these Religious Reformers: being at <hi>Willingborow</hi> at the Sign of the <hi>Swan,</hi> two maid Servants making a bed, some of these Rebels did sollicite them to incontinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but the Maids refusing to hearken to their
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:103099:57"/>
beastly sollicitations, they began to offer violence, and to enforce what they could not perswade, they still making resistance, they shot one of them dead in the place, and shot the other through the wrist: such Monuments of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> do these blessed Reformers leave at all places where they come.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Frederick Gibb</hi> Parson of <hi>Hartist</hi> in <hi>Suffolke,</hi> in Morning Prayer before his Sermon, desired his Parishoners to give attention to one of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Declarations newly set forth, with an express Command to have it published in all Parish Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, thereby to rectifie the People, and to wipe off those false Impressions which the Incendiaries of the Kingdom had made in them concerning the Kings Actions and Intentions: whereupon one Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> a Parishioner being present, impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly replied unto him, openly in the Church, that he might be ashamed to abuse the People by Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Majesties Declarations unto them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would fetch him some Parliament Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations which were a great deal better to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished unto them; while this railing <hi>Rabshekeh</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled his Sovereign, Mr. <hi>Gibb</hi> as if he had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Command in that case given, <hi>answer him not,</hi> made no reply at all, but as not heeding this snarler, calls on the Congregation a second time to give attention, <hi>Coleman</hi> interrupts him again, and in a scoffing manner saies, <hi>Well then Sir, you mean to be an obedient Servant to his Majesty,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gibb</hi> then thinking it not only seasonable but necessary to profess his Loyalty, replied, <hi>Yes, Sir, I am and hope to continue a faithful Servant unto Him as long as I live:</hi> and so proceeds to read the Declaration; the People notwithstanding all this Incouragement
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:103099:57"/>
from <hi>Coleman</hi> to contradict with them, standing very attentive to hear it: The main drift of the Kings Declaration was to assure all His loving Subjects, That as He expected that they should make the Laws the rule of their obedience, so He would make the Laws the guide of His Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Mr. <hi>Gibb</hi> having published the Declaration, <hi>Coleman</hi> stands up and most Traitorously replied to his Parson, <hi>Well, Sir, the King neither is nor shall be Judge of the Law, whatever such prating fellows as you would have him:</hi> after this being inraged (as the rest of that Faction are) that the Peoples eyes should be opened, or that they should, being truly informed, conceive of the King as he is, a most just and pious Prince, but still to look on him and all his actions through those false Perspectives of slander and falsehood which they hold before their eyes; <hi>Coleman</hi> speeds to <hi>London,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains (to that Conventicle which call themselves a Parliament) against Mr. <hi>Gibb</hi> for so foul an Affront put upon them by Publishing the Kings Declaration: presently (being servilely Observant to every base informer) they dispatch several Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sevants to apprehend Mr. <hi>Gibb, he seeing the Storm coming</hi> (as wise men do) <hi>hides himself,</hi> after some time of retirement (advised unto it by his friend) he goes to <hi>London,</hi> where by the great mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of friends, and paying fees to the sum of 30 <hi>l.</hi> he was dismissed, upon engagement to be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming, whensoever they should call for him.</p>
                  <p>There is none so insolent and intolerable as a base mean man started up into command or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, we cannot give you a greater instance, than in that beggarly Captain <hi>Ven,</hi> Citizen of <hi>London</hi> made <hi>Colonel</hi> and Commander in chief of <hi>Windsor-Castle,</hi>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:103099:58"/>
who doth not only assume to himself the propriety of his Sovereigns house, dating his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to <hi>Jezabel</hi> his Wife, <hi>From our Castle at Windsor,</hi> and building some additions to the Deans lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as if he meant to set up his rest there, and make that his habitation: when no place in that Royal Castle is fit for such a Couple but the <hi>Cole-house,</hi> and even that too good for them; but as if there would never come a time to call him to an account, he doth use the Gentlemen and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers taken by the Rebels, and sent Prisoners thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with that cruelty and inhumanity, as if they were Turks, not Christians, for the Gentlemen that are Prisoners there are not only kept from Church, nor permitted to receive the Sacrament neither from their own Preachers, nor from any friend whom they could procure to do that office for them, nay they were not permitted to joyn together in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions in their private lodgings, but each man a part, and if this petty Tyrant could have hindred that intercourse which every particular devout Soul injoys with his God, this <hi>Atheist</hi> would have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that too. And because the sedentary Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Lives which they led there were prejudicial to their healths, they earnestly entreated <hi>Ven</hi> that they might recreate themselves in the Tennis-Court near the <hi>Keep,</hi> and offered to be at the charges of a Guard, if those high walls, and the many guards about them were not thought sufficient to secure them, but yet were denied. Nay, when the <hi>Sheriff</hi> of <hi>Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex</hi> was brought Prisoner from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Windsor</hi> very lame, though his Chirurgion offered Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Ven</hi> to be deposed, that on the least neglect his Leg was like to gangreen, yet after he came to <hi>Windsor,</hi> he was forced to lie with the rest of the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:103099:58"/>
Knights and Gentlemen on the ground many nights; at last shewing his leg to <hi>Ven,</hi> he confessed that he never saw a more dangerous lameness, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to acquaint the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Essex</hi> with it: and the Sheriff himself being acquainted with the <hi>Earl,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming on some interest in him, wrote unto him to acquaint him with his condition, and earnestly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating him that he might be sent to <hi>London,</hi> and disposed of, though in a Dungeon, for a week, that he might have the assistance of his own Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian, and Chirurgion, offering to give any securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and be at any charges to assure him of his safe return, to render himself true Prisoner; but neither the sense of his misery, nor his earnest sollicitations could prevail with his <hi>Excellency.</hi> And if the Knights and Gentlemen who had money to bribe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion which they could not intreat, found no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter measure at their hands, what then, think you, were those heavy pressures under which the poor common Soldiers groaned? there were in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle eight poor Soldiers to whom the Sheriff of <hi>Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex</hi> allowed eight shillings a week: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing because they refused to take the <hi>wages of Iniquity,</hi> and serve under the Rebels Colours, and fight against their Sovereign, they starved them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that being released, (that they might not die in the Castle) coming into the air, three of them fell down dead in the streets: three more recovered as far as <hi>Eaton,</hi> where a good Woman for five shillings a week given for their relief by the Sheriff of <hi>Sussex,</hi> gave them entertainment, and when the Sheriff made his happy escape, he left them alive.</p>
                  <p>There was a poor man living near <hi>Moore Park,</hi> whom (when Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> was in those parts)
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103099:59"/>
commanded to shew him where the Pipes lay which conveyed water to the Castle, for this crime they apprehend him, and commit him Prisoner to the Castle, where they fed him with so slender diet, that they even starved him: and when upon his Wives tears and lamentable cries that she and her Children were like to starve at home, while her Husband starved at <hi>Windsor,</hi> they having no subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence but what he got by the sweat of his browes, he was released, he was not able to stand on his legs, and whether dead since we have no infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
                  <p>There was at the same time in the Castle, one Lieutenant <hi>Atkinson</hi> Prisoner, who suffering under the same want of necessary food, sent to his Father, humbly petitioning for relief; his Father though a man of good estate, returned answer, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he would take profered Entertainment from the Parliament, he should lie there, rot, and starve, and be damn'd for him: He finding no pity from his Father, where Nature and Religion bade him expect it, petitioned the Gentlemen in the <hi>Keep</hi> for bread, as many others daily did, and on his Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had monies sent him, but died starved two daies after, and left this just ground to the World to make this Observation, That <hi>where Puritanism prevails, it cancels all Obligations both of Religion and Nature, and never fails to make men guilty of that sin which is in the number of those, which the Scripture tells us shall heap wrath on the end of the World, the want of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affection.</hi>

                     <hi>WIlliam Chaldwell</hi> of <hi>Thorgonby</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Lincoln</hi> Esquire, and Justice of Peace, being an aged Gentleman, yet his Loyalty and desire to serve the King in his just Wars, made him over-look his infirmities, so that he resolved in person to come to his assistance: To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he provided four horses compleatly furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of which the Rebels having intelligence, they surprize him and seize on his horses. In <hi>February</hi> 1643. some Rebel-Troopers came to Mr. <hi>Chaldwells</hi> House and demanded entrance, which he deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unless they could shew some Commission from the King, they presently broke up his Hall win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and forcing his entrance, apprehend his Person: yet his Person is not all they come for, they begin to plunder his Goods, and the first thing which they lay hold on, was some Linnen lying on the Hall Table. A Servant of Mr. <hi>Chaldwells</hi> stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by, unwilling to lose any thing, if it might be saved, takes hold on the Linnen too, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats the Troopers to spare it: Presently some
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103099:60"/>
cry out Shoot him, which was no sooner said than done, for one dscharging a Pistol at him, shot a Bullet into his heart, and the top of his scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-stick into his Body near it. The poor man instantly fell down dead, hardly by any motion expressing the fare-well of life: While most stood amazed at so barbarous an act, some make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, thinking to help him, but were forbid by these bloody Villains to come near him, who were so far from remorse for what they had done, that tomurther they added Theft, diving into the Pockets of him whom they had thus murthered, and robbing him of his moneys: Nay his Wife whom they had murthered, hearing of this sad ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, being great with child, came to see her dead Husband, but was not permitted to come near him, being threatned by these Troopers, that if she came near him, they would do unto her as they had done unto her Husband, shoot her dead.</p>
                  <p>Having done their pleasure in Mr. <hi>Chaldwell</hi>'s House, they carry him away Prisoner to <hi>Lincoln</hi>; Being come thither, they commit him to the Town Goal, and lodged him there in the common <hi>Keep</hi> amongst Murtherers and Felons: The day after the <hi>Lincoln-shire</hi> Rebels received the defeat before <hi>Newarke,</hi> by a verbal command from the Earl of <hi>Lincolne</hi> he was removed from the Town Prison to the Castle, in <hi>Lincolne,</hi> where he was put into a nasty stinking place called the Witch-hole, and without any regard to his Quality, being a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of prime note in his Country, or to his age being an old man, they permit him to stay there all night, having no other bed but the Ground, and no other pillow but the hard stones. The next day they vouchsafe him the favour to let him pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103099:60"/>
a little and but a very little better accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation by buying out some poor Prisoners out of their lodging: remaining there in this disconsolate condition, his Wife an aged Gentlewoman came to visit him, being very willing to share with him in his Misery, as before she had done in his Prosperity.</p>
                  <p>Having spent some time in mutual consolation, and exhorting one another patiently to bear this unjust oppression, hoping that they might enjoy one anothers society, in so mean a condition, without the envy of their oppressors: but even this contented misery did not last long, for the next day after the Rebels lost <hi>Grantham</hi> by the Kings recovering that Town, out of their posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the Governour of <hi>Lincoln</hi> (<hi>Welden</hi> by name) inraged, and not knowing where to reek his malice safer than on this poor old Gentleman, comes up to the Castle, and most imperiously com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that <hi>Chaldwell</hi> should come before him: the Messenger that was sent to command his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, returned with this answer, That Mr. <hi>Chald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> laboured under some indisposition, that he was in bed, and his Wife with him: the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour not satisfied with so reasonable an answer, snatched a cudgel out of a Soldiers hand, and swears that he would make the old rascal rise: in this fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away he goes to Mr. <hi>Chaldwell</hi>'s Chamber, and rushing in, in a menacing way shakes his cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel at him, and holding it upon his head, threatned to bastinado him if he did not rise presently; the good old Gentlewoman his Wife, prognosticating by the rough message sent her Husband, that there was a storm coming, forsook her bed, and stood by it in her Night-gown, but bare-legged, there to interpose and plead for her Husband if occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:103099:61"/>
served: and now finding more inhumanity than her fear at first suggested, in an humble manner she beseeched the Governour to use her Husband like a Gentleman, not like a dog, to be awed by a cudgel. The Goververnour impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of any mediation, though from a Wife, and though backed with never so much reason, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands his Soldiers to take her away, which they did in so rude and boisterous a manner, that they dragged her down the Stairs, pulled her dressing off her head, and at last thrust her out of the Castle. Being thus violently snatched from her dear Husband, and fearing he might suffer as much violence within, as she did in being thrust out of the Castle, she sits down on a stone at the Castle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, where the winter blasts fann'd her gray hair, a sad spectacle to all that passed by, and knew who she was. Many there were that pitied her distress, and would willingly have received her into their houses, but durst not; 'tis a Crime to shew mercy where the Rebels intend cruelty. At last having sate there long, full of tears and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, baffled with cold winds and weather, a sister of Mr. <hi>Stutts</hi> the Apothecary (and the God of mercy restore it an hundred fold into her bosome) sends her a Petticoat (for they thrust her out with no cloaths on but her Night-gown) to fence her against the extremity of the cold. But to let this charitable Gentlewoman know that the rewards of mercy are to be expected in another World, and that here to do good, and for that to suffer evil, is the recompence of this World, that very after-noon her Brothers house was plundered, and all their Goods seized on, so that they needed a return of that compassion in the evening which
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103099:61"/>
they shewed to others in the morning. <hi>Welden</hi> the Governour having compelled the good old Gentleman to rise out of his bed, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his present infirmity, sends him from his poor lodging which he had lately purchased, to the common Dungeon, where he had neither light nor air but what the Grate afforded. The place was of such condition, that there being three Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners with him in the same room, but one of four must lie down at once, the rest must stand: and yet in this little ease (as was testified by a Letter under his own hand) he remained eleven or twelve nights without Bed, Chair, or Stool: and in that time, for four or five nights, he was not permitted to go forth to do the Offices of nature, a command being given, that if he offered to stir forth they should beat out his brains. Thus much and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other particulars were signified to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners at <hi>Newarke,</hi> when the Ammunition came from thence: At which time Information was given, that Mr. <hi>Chaldwell</hi> was then in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition not much better than what you have heard here related: and whether their barbarous cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and inhumanity have not set an end to his sufferings by Death, is uncertain.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> the second of <hi>July</hi> 1643. in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, ten or twelve Troopers under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Captain <hi>Samuel</hi> came from <hi>Northampton</hi> to <hi>Wedon Pinkney</hi> in the same County, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither in Prayer-time, they came into the Church, one of them being Horse-keeper (as it was reported) to Sir <hi>Richard Samuel,</hi> Father to the Captain, came up to the reading Pew, where Mr. <hi>Losse</hi> Parson of that Parish was officiating Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, and commanded him to leave off
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103099:62"/>
his Pottage and to follow him: Mr. <hi>Losse</hi> intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in that sacred work, but to have patience until he had finished what he had began: <hi>Patience me no patience</hi> (replied the Groom) <hi>my business is of greater importance than to admit of any delay, come away therefore, or I will pull you out by the ears</hi>: thereupon not knowing whose Soldiers they were, nor of what consequence their business might be, or if he had known both, yet not able to make resistance, he obeys his command, and followed him into the Church-yard. Being come thither, Mr. <hi>Losse</hi> demands what he would have with him? the Groom tells him, that he must go along with them to <hi>Northampton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Losse</hi> demands again, by what authority, and by vertue of what Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion? The Groom replies, that he should know that when he came to <hi>Northampton.</hi> Mr. <hi>Losse</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats that he may be excused, alledging that he had lost Twelve or Thirteen Horses, taken from him by the Parliament Soldiers, and that he had never a Horse able to carry him two miles out of the Town: one of the Troopers swears Wounds and Blood, that he would carry him behind him, and if that did not like him, he would drag him along with a halter at his horse tail. Mr. <hi>Losse</hi> abominating so great insolency from Grooms, bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told them, <hi>That he would never be a Slave to slaves</hi>; and so rushing from them, took Sanctuary in the Church, and shut the door upon him, and perceiving the door on the other side of the Church open, the People having unbarred it for their speedier passage out, he hastens thither, and tho he made what speed he could, he was like to be prevented by one of the Troopers who was come about and was ready to enter the Church on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back:
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103099:62"/>
which Mr. <hi>Losse</hi> observing, took up the bar of the door, and resolutely ran at the Trooper to unhorse him: This unexpected resistance so valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, put the Trooper to a retreat, whereby Mr. <hi>Losse</hi> gained time to bar the door fast against him. Having shut both the Church doors upon himself, and the remainder of the Congregation, some being fled for fear; the Clerk at a hole gave him the Key of the Belfrey: Mr. <hi>Losse</hi> not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself secure enough in the Church, gets up into the Belfrey, and locks the doors fast after him; being come to the place where the Bells hang, he discovers over head a little hole, only big enough for a man to creep through, and a ladder stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there which led up unto it, Mr. <hi>Losse</hi> goes up the ladder, and through the hole gets upon the Leads, and with great difficulty draws the Ladder after him, being massy and very heavy; by which means he did not only deprive his pursuers of the means to come at him, but with the Ladder laid over the hole, baracadoed the passage against them: and now being here, had he had any wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon to defend himself, he had been impregnable. While Mr. <hi>Losse</hi> was up in the Belfrey securing of himself, the Troopers are at the Church windows, endeavouring to wrench out the Iron bars, but without any success: at last with their Pole-axes and great Tombstones impiously taken from the Graves of the dead, they break open the Church doors; having thus forced their entrance they ride into the Church (not remembring they were in Gods House) from one end of it to another, spur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and switching their Horses purposely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the People. These barbarous outrages did much affright the People, but especially Mrs. <hi>Losse</hi>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:103099:63"/>
and her poor Children, whom it most concerned, Mr. <hi>Losse</hi> being the only man aimed at; Mrs. <hi>Losse</hi> fell into a swoon in the Church, and had no shew of life in her for a long time; at which the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple moved with compassion, interceded with the Troopers, and desired them to desist, putting them in mind of the place where they were, a place where God met with his People, and they with their God. It seems this Congregation had been better taught, than to subscribe to Doctor <hi>Twist</hi> the Proloquutor of the absurd <hi>Heterogenious</hi> Synod, his Interpretation of that Text of Scripture, <hi>Ye shall keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my Sanctuary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> in his Preface to Mr. <hi>Meads</hi> Book of the <hi>Apostacy of the latter times:</hi> as if this Text enjoyned no reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to be used towards the places of Gods pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worship; they were much scandalized at this prophane Irreverence, and made it an argument to awe them to civil demeanour at least, because of the place: and withal they objected, that they did much abuse themselves, and dishonour their cause by such outragious carriages: all this would reflect on the cause they pretended to maintain. And lastly, they alledged, that if they had any shame in them, they might be ashamed, in the Lords House on the Lords day to abuse a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister in his own Congregation, who besides the honour and reverence due to his calling, might challenge some respect from them being a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of good Birth and Descent. In reply to so good reason, (being indeed but <hi>Pearl cast before Swine</hi>) one breaks out with a great oath, swear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing Wounds and Blood (so that all the Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is not on the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> side) and saying, <hi>What do you tell me of Birth and Descent, a Plague take him
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103099:63"/>
and his Gentility, I hope within this year to see never a Gentleman in England:</hi> you remember the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>Children and Fools tell truth,</hi> having thus des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised all wholsome admonition, they go to the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, they break open the door, and come to the place where the Bells did hang, and from the top of the Frames of the Bells endeavoured through the hole (but now mentioned) to get upon the Leads, where Mr. <hi>Losse</hi> was, but he having stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that passage with the Ladder, and making the best use he could of his hands and feet (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the weapons either offensive or defensive which he had) made good the place against them: yet notwithstanding in the Resistence he was in very great danger to lose his life, for they dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their Pistols at him at least eight or nine times, but by the good providence of God they missed their mark, with their Swords they wounded him in three several parts of his body: yet God be blessed the wounds were not mortal; at last hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received a hurt in his hand, having a vein prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with one of their Swords, his blood flowed so fast upon the Troopers underneath him, that as they bragged there, and in other places after they were gone thence, they thought they had dispatched him, and therefore thinking him to be a dead man, they left him, yet to imbalm him to his funeral, they pour out a flood of reproachful names upon him, calling him Rogue, Rascal, Slave, Villain, Dog, Devil, making no stop till their Master the Devil, and their own memories could suggest no more names of the same stamp: At last, to seal up all, for fear they had not murthered him, they protest with many Execrations upon themselves, that if they had not now sped him (which yet they
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103099:64"/>
hoped they had) they would return another time, and have him either dead or alive.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Bristow</hi> in <hi>Devonshire</hi> there dwells a Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (and though I cannot tell his name, yet let it not weaken the credit of the Relation) who not satisfied with the Parliaments proceedings in taking up Arms against their lawful undoubted Sovereign, stood in a seeming Neutrality: at last conceiving it time to declare himself, he openly adhered to the Kings Party: hereupon he was very diligently sought after, and the Earl of <hi>Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> sent a Troop of Horse to his House to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him: when they came thither, they found not the good man at home, but a Son of his, about Ten or Eleven years old, they ask him where his Father was, the Child replied, that he was not at home, they threaten him, and use all arts to make him discover where his Father had hid himself; the Child being ignorant it seems where his Father was, still persisted in the same answer, that he knew not where he was: hereupon they threaten to hang him; neither doth that prevail: at last they take the poor innocent Child and hang him up, either because he would not betray his Father, had he been able to satisfie their doubt, or for not having the Spirit of Prophecy, not being able to receive what by an ordinary way of knowledg he did not know: having let him hang a while, they cut him down, not intending to hang him unto death, but being cut down they could perceive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing discovering life in him, hereupon in a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous way of experiment, they prick him with their Swords in the back and thighs, using the means leading to death, to find out life: at last after some long stay, some small symptomes of life did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear:
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103099:64"/>
yet so weak that there they left him nearer the confines of death than life: and whether the Child did ever recover, is more than my Informer can as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure me. Only, Courteous Reader, observe from this short Narration, that these Bloody Rebels spare neither the venerableness of the Sacred Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the infirmities of old Age, or the tenderness of Youth.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THere is in the Isle of <hi>Purbeck</hi> a strong Castle called <hi>Corffe Castle,</hi> seated on a very steep Hill, in the fracture of a Hill in the very midst of it, being eight miles in length, running from the East end of the <hi>Peninsula</hi> to the West: and though it stand between the two ends of this fracture, so that it may seem to lose much advantage of its natural and artificial strength as commanded from thence, being in height equal to, if not over-look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tops of the highest Towers of the Castle, yet the structure of the Castle is so strong, the ascent so steep, the Walls so massie and thick, that it is one of the impregnablest Forts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and of very great concernment, in respect
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103099:65"/>
of its command over the Island, and the places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. This Castle is now the Possession and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Right Honorable Sir <hi>John Banks,</hi> Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and one of his Majesties most Honorable Privy Council, who receiving Commands from the King to attend Him at <hi>York,</hi> in Easter Term, 1642. had leave from the two Houses to obey those Commands: After the unhappy Differences between the King and the two Houses, or rather between the King and the Faction in both Houses, grew high, it being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally feared that the Sword would decide the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie; the Lady <hi>Bankes,</hi> a virtuous and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Lady, resolved with her Children and Family to retire to this Castle, there to shelter themselves from the storm which she saw coming, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly she did; there she and her Family remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in peace all the Winter, and a great part of the Spring, until <hi>May,</hi> 1643. about which time the Rebels, under the command of Sir <hi>Walter Earl,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Trenchard,</hi> and others, had possessed themselves of <hi>Dorchaster, Lyme, Melcome, Weymouth, Wareham,</hi> and <hi>Pool,</hi> (<hi>Portland</hi> Castle being treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously delivered to the Rebels) only <hi>Corfe</hi> Castle remaining in Obedience to the King: but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels knowing how much it concerned them to add this Castle to their other Garrisons, to make all the Sea-coast wholly for them; and thinking it more feisible to gain it by Treachery than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Hostility, resolved to lay hold on an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity coming on, to see if they could become Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of it.</p>
                  <p>There is an ancient usage that the Major and Barons (as they call them) of <hi>Corfe</hi> Castle, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed by the Gentry of the Island, have permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:103099:65"/>
from the Lord of the Castle, on <hi>May-day,</hi> to course a Stag, which every year is performed with much Solemnity and great concourse of People: On this day some Troops of Horse from <hi>Dorchester,</hi> and other places, came into this Island, intending to find other Game then to hunt the Stag, their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness being suddenly to surprize the Gentlemen in the Hunting, and to take the Castle; the News of their coming disperst the Hunters, and spoiled the sport for that day, and made the Lady <hi>Bankes</hi> to give order for the safe Custody of the Castle-gates, and to keep them shut against all comers. The Troopers having mist their Prey on the Hills, (the Gentlemen having withdrawn themselves) some of them came to the Castle under a pretence to see it, but entrance being denyed them, the common Soldiers used threatning Language, casting out words implying some intentions to take the Castle; but the Commanders (who better knew how to conceal their Resolutions) utterly disavowed any such thought, denying that they had any such Commission; however the Lady <hi>Banks</hi> very wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and like her self, hence took occasion to call in a Guard to assist her, not knowing how soon she might have occasion to make use of them, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now more than probable, that the <hi>Rebels</hi> had a design upon the Castle. The taking in this Guard, as it <hi>secured</hi> her at <hi>home,</hi> so it rendred her <hi>suspected abroad</hi>; from thence-forward there was a watchful and vigilant eye to survey all her Actions, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever she sends out, or sends for in, is suspected; her ordinary Provisions for her Family are by fame multiplyed, and reported to be more than double what indeed they were, as if she had now an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to Victual and Man the Castle against the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103099:66"/>
Forces of the two Houses of Parliament; present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Letters are sent from the Committees of <hi>Poole,</hi> to demand the four small Pieces in the Castle, and the pretence was, because the <hi>Islanders</hi> conceived strange <hi>Jealousies,</hi> that the Pieces were mounted and put on their Carriages: Hereupon the Lady <hi>Bankes</hi> dispatched Messengers to <hi>Dorchester</hi> and <hi>Poole,</hi> to entreat the <hi>Commissioners</hi> that the small Piece might remain in the Castle for her own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and to take away the ground of the <hi>Islan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Jealousies,</hi> she caused the Pieces to be taken off their Carriages again; hereupon a promise was made, that they should be left to her possession. But there passed not many days, before forty Sea-men (they in the Castle not suspecting any such thing) came very early in the Morning to demand the Pieces; the Lady in Person (early as it was) goes to the Gates, and desires to see their Warrant; they produced one, under the hands of some of the Commissioners; but instead of delivering them, though at that time there were but five Men in the Castle, yet these five, assisted by the Maid-servants at their Ladies Command, mount these Pieces on their Carriages again, and lading one of them, they gave fire; which small Thunder so affrighted the Sea-men, that they all quitted the place and ran away. They being gone, by beat of Drum she summons help into the Castle, and upon the Alarm given, a very considerable Guard of Tenants and Friends came in to her assistance, there being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al some fifty Arms brought into the Castle, from several parts of the Island: this Guard was kept in the Castle about a Week, during this time, many threatning Letters were sent unto the Lady, telling her, what great Forces should be sent to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103099:66"/>
fetch them, if she would not by fair means be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to deliver them, and to deprive her of her Auxiliaries, all or most of them being Neighbors thereabouts, they threaten, that if they oppose the delivery of them, they would fire their Houses: presently their Wives come to the Castle, there they weep and wring their hands, and with clamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Oratory perswade their Husbands to come home, and not by saving others, to expose their own Houses to spoil and ruine, nay to reduce the Castle into a distressed condition, they did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intercept two hundred weight of Powder provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded against a Siege, but they interdict them the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Common-Markets: Proclamation is made at <hi>Warham</hi> (a Market-Town hard by) that no Beer, Beef, or other provision should be sold to the Lady <hi>Banks,</hi> or for her use; strict Watches are kept, that no Messenger or Intelligence shall pass into or out of the Castle. Being thus distressed, all means of Victualling the Castle, being taken away, and being but slenderly furnished for a Siege, either with Ammunition or with Victual, at last they came to a Treaty of Composition, of which the result was, That the Lady <hi>Banks</hi> should deliver up those four small Pieces, the biggest carrying not above a three pound Bullet, and that the Rebels should permit her to enjoy the Castle, and Arms in it, in peace and quietness.</p>
                  <p>And though this wise Lady knew too well to rest satisfied or secured in these promises (their often breach of Faith having sufficiently instructed her what she might expect from them) yet she was glad of this opportunity to strengthen her self even by that means, by which many in the World thought she had done her self much prejudice; for
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103099:67"/>
the Rebels being now possessed of their Guns, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed the Castle to be theirs, as sure as if they had actually possessed it. Now it was no more but ask and have: hereupon they grow remiss in their Watches, negligent in their Observations, not heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was brought in, nor taking care, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to intercept Supplies, which might enable them to hold out against a Siege: and the Lady, making good use of this remisness, laid hold on the present opportunity, and as much as the time would permit, furnish'd the Castle with Provisions of all sorts. In this <hi>Interval,</hi> there was brought in an hundred and half of Powder, and a quantity of Match proportionable. And understanding that the Kings Forces, under the Conduct of Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> and the Marquess <hi>Hertford</hi> were advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing towards <hi>Blanford,</hi> she by her Messenger made her address to them, to signifie unto them the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Condition</hi> in which they were, the great <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> of the place, desiring their assistance, and in particular, that they would be pleased to take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their serious consideration, to send some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders thither to take the Charge of the Castle; hereupon they send Captain <hi>Laurence,</hi> son of Sir <hi>Edward Laurence,</hi> a Gentleman of that Island, to Command in Chief; but he coming without a Commission, could not command moneys or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions to be brought in until it was too late. There was likewise in the Castle one Captain <hi>Bond,</hi> an old Soldier, whom I should deprive of his due honor, not to mention him, having a share in the honor of this Resistance. The first time the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels faced the Castle, they brought a Body of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two and three hundred Horse and Foot, and two Pieces of Ordnance, and from the Hills play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103099:67"/>
on the Castle, fired four houses in the Town, and then summoned the Castle; but receiving a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial for that time, they left it. But on the three and twentieth of <hi>June,</hi> the Sagacious Knight, Sir <hi>Walter Earle</hi> (that hath the gift of discerning Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and might have made up his nine and thirty Treasons, forty, by reckoning in his own) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed by Captain <hi>Sidenham,</hi> Captain <hi>Henry Jarvis,</hi> Captain <hi>Skuts,</hi> son of that Arch-Traytor <hi>Skut</hi> of <hi>Pool,</hi> with a Body of between five and six hundred, came and possessed themselves of the Town, taking the opportunity of a Misty morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they might find no resistance from the Castle. They brought with them to the Siege a Demy-Canon, a Culverin and two Sacres, with these and their small Shot, they played on the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle on all Quarters of it, with good observation of Advantages, making their Battery strongest where they thought the Castle weakest. And to bind the Soldiers by tye of Conscience to an eager prosecution of the Siege, they administer them an Oath, and mutually binde themselves to most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Resolutions, <hi>That if they found the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants obstinate not to yield, they would maintain the Siege to Victory, and then deny Quarter unto all, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling without mercy, Men, Women and Children.</hi> As to bring on their own Soldiers, they abused them with falshoods, telling them, That the Castle stood in a Level, yet with good advantages of approach; that there were but forty Men in the Castle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of twenty were for them; that there was rich Booty, and the like: So, during the Siege, they used all base unworthy means, to corrupt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants, to betray the Castle into their hands; the better sort they endeavor to corrupt with Bribes;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103099:68"/>
to the rest they offer double Pay, and the whole Plunder of the Castle; when all these Arts took no effect, then they fall to Stratagems and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines. To make their approaches to the Wall with more safety, they make two Engines; one they call the Sow, the other the Boar, being made with boards lined with Wool to dead the shot. The first that moved forward was the Sow, but not being Musket proof, she cast nine of eleven of her Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; for the Musketiers from the Castle were so good marks-men at their Legs, the only part of all their Bodies left without defence, that nine ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as well as their broken and battered Legs would give them leave; and of the two which knew neither how to run away, nor well to stay, for fear, one was slain. The Boar, of the two (a man would think) the valianter Creature, seeing the ill success of the Sow, to cast her Litter before her time, durst not advance. The most advantageous part for their Batteries, was the Church, which they without fear of prophanation used, not only as their Rampart, but their Rendezvouz: of the Surpless they made two Shirts for two Soldiers, they broke down the Organs, and made the Pipes serve for Cases to hold their Powder and Shot; and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing furnished with Musket-Bullets, they cut off the Lead of the Church, and roll'd it up, and shoot it without ever casting it in a mould. Sir <hi>Walter</hi> and the Commanders were earnest to press forward the Soldiers, but as prodigal as they were of the blood of their common Soldiers, they were sparing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of their own: It was a general Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that valiant Sir <hi>Walter</hi> never willingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed himself to any hazard, for being by chance endangered with a Bullet, shot through his Coat,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:103099:68"/>
afterwards he put on a Bears skin, and to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal honor of this Knights valour be it recorded, for fear of Musket-shot, (for other they had none) he was seen to creep on all four, on the sides of the Hill, to keep himself out of danger. This base Cowardise in the Assailants, added Courage and Resolution to the Defendants: therefore not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd by want, but rather to brave the Rebels, they sallyed out, and brought in eight Cows and a Bull into the Castle, without the loss of a Man, or a Man wounded. At another time, five Boys fetcht in four Cows. They that stood on the Hills, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to one in a House in the Valley, crying, <hi>Shoot Anthony</hi>; but <hi>Anthony</hi> thought it good to sleep in a whole skin, and durst not look out, so that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward it grew into a Proverbial Jeer, from the Defendants to the Assailants, <hi>Shoot Anthony.</hi> The Rebels having spent much time and Ammunition, and some men, and yet being as far from hopes of taking the Castle, as the first day they came thither. At last, the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> sends them a supply of an hundred and fifty Mariners, with several Cart-loads of Petarrs, Granadoes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Warlike Provision, with Scaling-ladders to assault the Castle by Scaladoe: They make large offers to him that should first scale the Wall; 20 <hi>l.</hi> to the first, and so by descending sums a reward to the twentieth; but all this could not prevail with these silly Wretches, who were brought thither, as themselves confessed, like Sheep to the slaughter, some of them having but exchang'd the manner of their death, the Halter for the Bullet, having taken them out of Goals; one of them being taken Prisoner, had Letters Testimonial in his hands whence he came, the Letters I mean when he
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:103099:69"/>
was burnt for a Felon, being very visible to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, but when they found that perswasion could not prevail with such abject low spirited men, the Commanders resolve on another course, which was, to make them Drunk, knowing that Drunkenness makes some men fight like Lions, that being sober would run away like Hares. To this purpose they fill them with strong Waters, even to Madness, and ready they are now for any Design; and for fear Sir <hi>Walter</hi> should be valiant against his will, like <hi>Caesar,</hi> he was the only man almost <hi>that came sober to the assault</hi>: an imitation of the Turkish practice (for certainly there can be nothing of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it, to send poor Souls to Gods Judgment Seat, in the very act of two grievous Sins, <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Drunkenness</hi>) who to stupifie their Soldiers, and make them insensible of their dangers, give them <hi>Opium:</hi> being now armed with drink, they resolve to storm the Castle on all sides, and apply their Scaling-ladders, it being ordered by the Leaders (if I may without a Solecism call them so, that stood behind and did not so much as follow) that when 20 were entered, they should give a watch-word to the rest, and that was <hi>Old Wat</hi>: a word ill chosen by Sir <hi>Watt. Earle,</hi> and considering the business in hand little better than ominous, for if I be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the Hunters that beat Bushes for the fearful timerous Hare, call him <hi>Old Watt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being now Pot-valiant, and possessed with a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed Courage, which was to evaporate in sleep, they divide their Forces into two Parties, whereof one assaults the middle Ward, defended by valiant Captain <hi>Lawrence,</hi> and the greater part of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; the other assault the upper Ward, which the Lady <hi>Bankes,</hi> (to her Eternal Honor be it spoken)
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103099:69"/>
with her Daughters, Women, and five Soldiers, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to make good against the Rebels, and did bravely perform what she undertook; for by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving over Stones, and hot Embers, they repelled the Rebels, and kept them from climing their Ladders, thence to throw in that Wild-fire, which every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel had ready in his hand. Being repelled, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in this Siege and this Assault lost and hurt an hundred men, <hi>Old</hi> Sir <hi>Watt,</hi> hearing that the Kings Forces were advanced, cryed, and ran away crying, leaving <hi>Sydenham</hi> to Command in Chief, to bring off the Ordnance, Ammunition, and the remainder of the Army, who afraid to appear abroad, kept Sanctuary in the Church till night, meaning to Sup, and run away by Star-light; but Supper being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and set on the Table, an Alarm was given that the Kings Forces were coming: this News took away <hi>Sydenhams</hi> Stomack; all this Provision was but <hi>messes of Meat set before the Sepulchres of the dead</hi>; he leaves his Artillery, Ammunition, and (which with these men is something) a good Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ran away to take Boat for <hi>Poole,</hi> leaving likewise at the shore about an hundred Horse to the next Takers, which next day proved good prize to the Soldiers of the Castle. Thus after six Weeks strict Siege, this Castle, the desire of the Rebels, the Tears of <hi>Old</hi> Sir <hi>Watt,</hi> and the Key of those parts, by the Loyalty, and brave Resolution of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Lady, the valour of Captain <hi>Lawrence</hi> and some eighty Soldiers, (by the loss only of two men) was delivered from the Bloody Intentions of these Merciless Rebels, on the fourth of <hi>August,</hi> 1643.</p>

This Parliament being called, and these men made Members of the Lower House, they quickly perceived that this wished-for oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity was now come, wherein they might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert publick Justice to private revenge, quickly learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to exercise that Arbitrary unlimited power over
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103099:70"/>
their fellow Subjects, which the prevalence of a dangerous Faction had put in their hands. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the general practice since this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they accuse Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> of some Anti-parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amentary passages in his Sermons, which his Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges understood as little as his Accusers: Nay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it was with him (as with many of his Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Brethren) the same men were both his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers and Judges. However any or no accusation we know have served these mens turns, to bring Godly and Learned Ministers to the Bear-baiting of a Committee, and to put them into the expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive custody of a Serjeant at Arms: so it was with Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> they first pretended some Crimes, and on these pretences they commit him Prisoner to a Serjeant at Arms. Having deprived him of his Liberty, and put him into a consumption of his Estate by the unreasonable unlimited exactions of Parliament Goalers, they then think him reduced to such a condition as to be willing to hearken to a Composition, on any terms. At last vexed to an agreement, he is to enjoy his Liberty and Peace on this mutual stipulation: They are to pardon him the errour of his Doctrine, to deliver up his bail, being with two Sureties Parliament men bound in a Bond of two thousand pounds, and to give two hundred pounds towards his charges. Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> must resign his lately recovered Cure of <hi>Tuifordton</hi> to make way for a Clerk of their own: which to avoid farther molestation, to his very great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, he was inforced to condescend unto. After, in <hi>September,</hi> 1642. Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> riding to <hi>Taunton</hi> in <hi>Somersetshire,</hi> accompanied by one of the Prince's Servants, who wore his Masters Colours, was for that reason, together with that Gentleman, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:103099:71"/>
after his departure from thence, apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and like a Felon brought back to the Castle, where he remained Prisoner three weeks, and could not be released without the earnest solicitation of his friends, and his Wives humble and often petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning the Earle of <hi>Bedford.</hi> In <hi>November</hi> last suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering under continual molestations, and out of all hope to live peaceably at home, he resolved to put himself under the protection of Sir <hi>Ralph Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> Army then in <hi>Cornwal.</hi> To this purpose he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished three Horses and Arms proportionable, and set forward to deliver them up to his Majesties ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: but unhappily in the way thither he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted by the Earl of <hi>Stamfords</hi> Forces, under the command of Captain <hi>Gould,</hi> taken Prisoner, robb'd to the value of 80 <hi>l.</hi> the Plunderers leaving him not so much as a boot to ride in. By these he is led Captive to <hi>Liskard</hi> in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> where they kept him three days, in which time he and another Minister with him, with his servant, had but one pint of Beer for their sustinence, being kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either fire or light, and for one night had their hands bound behind them, and had been still kept in the like bondage, had not God in mercy res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued them by Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton,</hi> after the famous Battle of <hi>Liskard:</hi> During the time of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, they offer them Conditions on which they may purchase their liberty; <hi>viz.</hi> to pay three hundred pound; to take an Oath never any more to assist the King with Horse, Arms, or Money: But being delivered on far better terms, he was not long after imprisoned for giving God publick thanks for his deliverance. Afterwards, seeing that Religion it self was but abused, being made the Cloak of these mens Hypocrisie and Treasons, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:103099:71"/>
that they did <hi>fast but to strife and debate,</hi> he did not observe the Fast every last Wednesday in the Month, with that strict observation as was expected from him by that Faction; hereupon, some of them put him in mind of it: Good Friday coming on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, upon the last Wednesday in <hi>April</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired his Neighbours and Parishoners to keep that ancient Fast injoyned by the Church in Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of the bitter Death and Passion of Christ; and the better to invite them to that days solemn Humiliation, he preached to them twice that day. Though Sermons be all their Religion, yet two Sermons on <hi>Good Friday</hi> (received and practised by all Churches in all Ages, till of late a Jewish obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of one day hath shouldred out the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous observation of all other days) he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented before the Sessions, where <hi>Edmund Prideaux</hi> a Parliament man, and a pretender to this Law, prest this his Obedience to the Church most violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against him; malitiously affirming that he did it to affront the Parliament, and to advance Popish Superstition, and Innovation, and that therefore <hi>He</hi> (see what it is to be a Parliament man) would make him an <hi>Example</hi> to the World, and as the times then were (God, as he threatned Israel, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking us by foolish people</hi>) was like enough to have done it, had not Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> prevented him by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing himself, and so declined the evil intended against him. Yet we may not omit one thing: though it were so heinous a Crime in Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> not to observe one of their Wednesdays Fasts, yet Mr. <hi>Darke</hi> Minister of <hi>Musbury</hi> in the same County, and a man of that Faction could command his men to follow the Plough that day, and yet was never thought fit of a Reprehension, nor so much as a
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103099:72"/>
Brotherly Admonition: and no wonder, for tho heretofore <hi>Actions</hi> did <hi>Qualifie persons,</hi> and <hi>deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate</hi> them, by the Sectaries new Divinity they make <hi>Persons</hi> to <hi>Qualifie Actions,</hi> those things which are sins in others lose their <hi>Nature</hi> and their <hi>Name</hi> in a Child of God, and they will take it very ill from you not to be so reputed, though living in the most notorious scandalous sins that defile the Soul, and lay wast the Conscience of man. But to return to our story.</p>
                  <p>From the beginning of this Parliament (till God, by the glorious and no less than miraculous Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton,</hi> restored some Peace to that miserably distracted Country) Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> was not permitted to live quietly at his own dwelling, they threaten to hang him, and burn his house, which they plundered no less than seven times: and not content with this, they threaten to carry away his aged Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prisoner, being no less than 86 years of age; and had been as good as their word, (for in mischief they seldom fail of their promises) had not the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Parish (in detestation of so great bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barism,) rescued him out of their hands: And after that memorable defeat of the Rebels at <hi>Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> in the edge of <hi>Cornwal</hi> by the brave Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> returned to his own house, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no danger from the fitters of that broken Army: but four Troopers of the Rebels Horse came to his house, searched it very narrowly for him, insomuch that he heard them swear how cruelly they would use that Cavaliering Priest, if they could meet with him, when they were nearer him than they were aware of (had they known it) there being but an Inch board between him and them: at which time missing of the intended Prey, they wreck their
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103099:72"/>
malice on his houshold-stuff, what they could not carry away, they spoil; Beds, Bed-steads, Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, all are torn and spoiled: They plunder the Maid-servants, and that of their Smocks, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change in their very presence their lousie Shirts for their clean Linnen: Hereupon Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by experience, that there was no safety out of one of the Kings Armies (the only Protection which the King is able for the present to afford his good Subjects) he put himself under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Sir <hi>Ralph Hoptons</hi> Army, where he now remains.</p>
                  <p>While the Rebels Army lay at <hi>Tame</hi> sending out parties, by chance they lighted on some of the Kings Souldiers, and amongst them there was one, who touched in Conscience for so grievous a Sin, as lifting up his hand against his lawful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, the Lords anointed, forsook the Rebels Army, and was entertained in his Majesties pay: and being in their power, they resolve instantly to hang him: but with such Circumstances as in the murther of the Subject they evidently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest their malitious rebellious hearts towards their Sovereign. Nothing will serve to hang him on, but the sign-post of the <hi>Kings Head</hi> in <hi>Tame</hi>; the ppor man being ready to be thrown from the Ladder, prayed very fervently, and cried out <hi>Lord Jesus receive my Soul.</hi> The Rebels standing about him, instead of joyning with him in his Devotions, made a confused noise, and laughed at him. They that had so little mercy for his Soul, were not likely to draw out any bowels of Compassion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his body. No, they will not only murther him, but murther him by a lingring Torment; they will not afford him the favour of a running
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:103099:73"/>
knot quickly to obstruct the Throat, and totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of breath, but the halter is tyed so fast, that he hanged gasping for breath, not drawing so much as to maintain life, nor so little as sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to lose it: having in this torment hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a while, a barbarous inhuman Villain stept to him, and fearing he should give up his vexed Ghost too soon, he puts his hands under his feet and lifted him up to give him some scope of Respi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but even in this unchristian usage of a poor wretch, he did not forget to <hi>Blaspheme</hi> his <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>King</hi>: for having lifted him up, he turned the dying mans face towards the sign it self of the Kings Head: and jeeringly said, <hi>Nay, Sir you must speak one word with the King before you go, you are blindfold, and he cannot see, and by and by you shall both come down together!</hi> Let the World if it can now give us a parallel of so undutiful, so high a contempt of Regal Authority, or tell us whether any of the several Spawns of Hell but only an Atheistical Puritan could possibly commit such devilish Cruelties against his fellow Subject, or belch out such venome against his Sovereign. Amongst those many Sins which call for our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick humiliation and our earnest zeal to purge the land from the guilt which hath polluted it, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Contempt and Scorn of so good, so gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a King is none of the least.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> the 29. of <hi>May</hi> 1643. a Boy of five or six years of age, attended by a youth, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Oxford</hi> to his Father, an Officer in the Kings Army, passing through <hi>Buckinghamshire</hi> he fell into the hands of some Troopers of Colonel <hi>Goodwins</hi> Regiment, who not only pillaged him of the Cloaths which he brought with him, but took
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:103099:73"/>
his doublet off his back, and would have taken away his hat and boots, if the Youth that attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him had not very earnestly intercede for them to save them. For one of the Company more tender-hearted than the rest, moved with the Childs cries and affrightment, and with the Youths earnest entreaty, prevailed with the rest not to rob the Child of these necessary fences from the injury of wind and weather. Yet tho they spare him these things, they rob him of his Horse, and leave the poor Child to a tedious long Journey on foot: This barbarism to a poor Child far from his friends, almost distracted with fear, so prevailed with some, that they made Colonel <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Pye</hi> acquainted with it, hoping to find them sensible of so cruel practices on a poor Child: but these great Professors and Champions of Religion, only laughed at the relation, without giving any redress to the Childs injuries. This want of Justice in the Commanders, animated the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to prosecute their Villanies to a greater height: for that night they came to the place where the Child lay, and the poor Soul being in bed fast asleep, his innocent rest not disturbed with the injuries of the day: they dived into his, and his attendants pockets, robbed them of all their monies, and left them either to borrow more, or beg for sustenance in their Journey to <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Captain <hi>Duckenfield</hi> a Commander of the Rebels in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> came to Mr. <hi>Wright</hi>'s House, Parson of <hi>Wemslow</hi> in that County, a man of four score years of age, of a very honest Life and Conversation, and eminent for his Hospitality amongst his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors. The Captain and his followers enter the House by violence, killed two of his Maid-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103099:74"/>
wounded others, and in all probability had murthered Mr. <hi>Wright</hi> himself, had not his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors that loved him well rescued him out of their hands. The Crime objected against him was Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, and that amongst Rebels is Crime enough: for this he is forced to live an exile from his own habitation, and hath absented himself from his house now twelve months. The same Rebels came to one Mr. <hi>John Leech</hi> his house, in the same County, as I take it, they enter his house by violence, they kill one of his Maid-Servants, for endeavouring to keep the door shut against them, and took away Mr. <hi>Leech</hi> Prisoner. There was a Gentlewoman in the house come thither but two days before, who seeing so barbarous Cruelty practised upon Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents for no other fault but living in Peace and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, was so affrighted, that for some time she remained almost distracted.</p>
                  <p>When the rebellious City of <hi>London</hi> first deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up it self the servile instrument to execute the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal Commands of the heads of the Faction in Parliament; a Troop of factious Citizens under the command of Colonel <hi>Cromwell</hi> came to the University of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and there seized on the Persons of Doctor <hi>Beal,</hi> Doctor <hi>Martin,</hi> and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Sterne</hi> men of known Integrity, Exemplary lives, profound learning, and heads of several Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges in that famous University: having them in their Custody, they use them with all possible scorn and contempt, especially <hi>Cromwell</hi> behaving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self most insolently towards them, and when one of the Doctors made it a request to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> that he might stay a little to put up some linnen, <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> denied him the favour, and whether in a jeer, or simple malice told him, <hi>That it was not in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission:</hi>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:103099:74"/>
having now prepared a shew to entertain the People, in Triumph they lead them Captives towards <hi>London,</hi> where the People were before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand informed, what Captives Colonel <hi>Cromwell</hi> was bringing. In the Villages as they passed from <hi>Cambridg</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> the People were called by some of their Agents to come and abuse, and revile them. When they came to <hi>London,</hi> being to bring their Prisoners to the Tower, no other way would serve their turn, but from <hi>Shoreditch</hi> through <hi>Bartholomew-Fair,</hi> when the Concourse was as thick as the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation of Buyers and Sellers, and the warning of the Beadles of the Faction (that use to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to their Party) could make it; they lead these Captives leisurely through the midst of the Fair: as they pass along they are entertained with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, Reproaches, Scorns, and Curses, and considering the prejudice raised in the City of them, it was Gods great mercy that they found no worse usage from them: having brought them to the <hi>Tower,</hi> the People there use them with no less Incivility within the Walls, than the People did without, calling them <hi>Papists, Arminians,</hi> and I know not what. After some time Imprisonment there, they were removed to the Lord <hi>Peters</hi> House in <hi>Alders<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate-street</hi>; and though they often Petitioned to be heard and brought to judgment, yet they could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain neither a Trial, nor enlargement, unless to free their Bodies, they should ensnare their Souls by loans of Monies to be imployed against the King, or taking impious Oaths or Covenants: at last af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter almost a years imprisonment, on <hi>Friday</hi> the 11. of <hi>August</hi> 1643. by order from the Faction, that call themselves a Parliament, they were removed from thence, and all put on Ship-board in a Ship called
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:103099:75"/>
the <hi>Prosperous Sail,</hi> or the <hi>Prosperous Sailer,</hi> lying before <hi>Wapping.</hi> They went by Coach from <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dersgate-street</hi> to <hi>Billingsgate,</hi> in the way to the Common Stairs, there to take water; one was over-heard to say <hi>These look like honest men,</hi> and he was not a jot mistaken: however for bearing testimomy of the truth, he incurr'd the censure of a Malignant, and was in danger to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but another looking these grave learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in the face, reviled them, saying, <hi>That they did not look like Christians:</hi> and Prayed that they might break their Necks as they went down the Stairs to take water. This harsh usage they found by land, but yet they found far worse by water: being come on ship-board they were instantly put under Hatches, where the Decks were so low, that they could not stand upright, and yet were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied stools to sit on, or so much as a burden of straw to lie on. Into this <hi>Little Ease</hi> in a small Ship they crowd no less than four score Prisoners of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and that they might stifle one another, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more breath than what they sucked from one anothers mouths, most malitiously, and (certainly) to a murtherous intent, they stop up all the small Auger holes, and all other inlets which might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them with fresh air: an act of such horrid barbarism, that nor age, nor story, nor Rebellion can parallel; <hi>But, O Lord God to whom Vengeance belongeth, thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thy self, O let the vengeance of thy Servants blood, that hath been shed in this land, be openly shewed upon these</hi> worse than <hi>Heathen</hi> Salvages <hi>in our sight, O let the sorrowful sighing of thy Prisoners come before thee, according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die.</hi>

The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and his Nephews glad of so happy a meeting, after some stay to congratulate the good chance, and to refresh themselves, set forward in their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and passed in peace without danger until they came near <hi>Stony-Stratford,</hi> where a party of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gooners coming from <hi>Alesbury</hi> surprized them: and instantly (scarce asking them from whence they came) searched and disarmed them, which was no difficult atchievment, there being but one sword amongst all three. The Rebels take from them their Horses, their Coats and Mony: super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous things as they conceived for men designed to captivity: for having spoiled them of their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Mony, and Garments, they send them with a strong guard Prisoners to <hi>Ailesbury</hi>: while the rest of the Party lurking about <hi>Stony-Stratford,</hi> stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:103099:76"/>
there to expect some fresh Booty: And that in this we do not slander these great Champions of the Subjects Liberties and Properties, the issue will acquaint us, for presently after (to shew that all was Fish which came to net) they seized upon a poor Bone-lace man, and a Shoomaker, robbed them of what they had, and in the same manner sent them away Prisoners to <hi>Ailesbury.</hi> The Guard of Dragooners having brought their three Prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers about a mile and a half on the way towards <hi>Ailesbury,</hi> commanded them again to alight: The first Plunder was for the Captain or Commanders, or else a share was set apart <hi>Anathema</hi> for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the publick Cause, these men to whose trust they were committed, now intend to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for themselves: And first, they command Mr. <hi>Tyringham</hi> to put off his Cassock: who being not sudden in obeying the command, nor over-hasty to untye his Girdle to disrobe himself of the distinctive Garment of his Profession: (though now a Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sock contracted into the Compendium of a <hi>Gippo,</hi> is become the Garb of the Reformers) one of the Dragoons to quicken him, cut him through the hat into the Head with the Sword taken from one of his Nephews, and with another blow cut him over the fingers: Mr. <hi>Tyringham</hi> wondring at so barbarous usage without any provocation, came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him that had thus wounded him, and desired him to hold his hands, pleading that he was a <hi>Clergie-man,</hi> a <hi>Prisoner,</hi> and <hi>disarmed:</hi> the coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Villain either fearing the approach of a disarmed man, or willing to lay hold on any advantage to expose the Prisoners to the fury of his fellows, cried out, <hi>Shoot the Rogues, for they intend to resist:</hi> the word was no sooner given, but a Musquets was
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103099:76"/>
instantly discharged at one of Mr. <hi>Tyringhams</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews; but the Musqueteer missing his mark, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of the Rebels with his Sword aimed righter, and ran him into the shoulder: a Musquet was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the other Nephew, but Gods providence restrained the murtherous intention of the Rebel, that he did not give fire. Thus exercising their pleasure upon disarmed wounded men, they rob Mr. <hi>Tyringham</hi> of his Cassock, rifle all their pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, and take from them what they please; and to palliate their cruelty, they send two Dragooners back, to tell their Captains and their Companies, that the Prisoners committed to their Custody and Conduct made resistence: Upon this false Alarm given, presently the Captains and their Companies make up to them, to assist a strong Guard against three disarmed, and of them two wounded men; being come where they were, they encompass them about, and without any examination of the business, presuming the suggestion to be undoubted truth, one of the Rebels, Capt. <hi>Pollard</hi> by name, with a full blow strikes at Mr. <hi>Tyringham,</hi> and with his Sword cuts his Arme, and Cubit-bones cross the elbow almost asunder: Mr. <hi>Tyringham</hi> (almost threescore years of age within two) bore this barbarous usage with undaunted Courage, and hearing this bloody Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain called Captain <hi>Pollard,</hi> in a pleasant indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion expressed the sense of the injury but thus, <hi>That now he had made him a Pollard indeed:</hi> A Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophor easily understood by Wood-men, who usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally call a Tree, whose limbs or branches are lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped off, a Pollard: Mr. <hi>Tyringhams</hi> Arm thus mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably wounded, and hanging dangling from his shoulder, without any government from the nerves or sinews, one of his Nephews having a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>While these Gentlemen were in this miserable condition, Captain <hi>Pollard,</hi> not troubled at all for so bloody a fact, barbarously committed by himself on an aged Gentleman, and a Minister of that Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel which they falsly pretend to maintain, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed deny and blaspheme in all their actions, turned aside to <hi>Whaddon Chase,</hi> and sported himself in kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling some of His Majesties Deer, which he carried along with him to <hi>Ailesbury:</hi> after almost four hours riding, tired out with tired Jades, and fainting with loss of blood, the Prisoners were again command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to alight at a Town called <hi>Whitchurch</hi> within two miles of <hi>Ailesbury.</hi> Here they fall on Mr. <hi>Tyring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> afresh, and plunder him as eagerly as if he had been new come into their hands, and not touched by them before.

After this the Brownists and Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists of that place (with which that Country swarms) threaten to kill him; Mr. <hi>Wiborow,</hi> not daring to trust himself amongst these cruel blood-thirsty men, to preserve his life, was compelled to leave his Cure, his Wife and Children, some seven Months since, and to put himself under the Kings

protection: hoping that his absence might be a means to secure his Wife and Children, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with these Monsters to permit them to enjoy that which he left behind him for their sustenance: but his absence was so far from working this good effect in them, that they made use of it, to eject him out of the possession of the Profits of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage, and his Wife and Children out of their house, exposing them harbourless to the wide World: for taking advantage of his absence, they accuse him to the pretended Parliament, and frame a Bill of Falshood and Lies against him, thereby to gain a Sequestration of his Living: A business not of any great difficulty, they being more ready to grant such illegal oppressive ejections, than the People to ask them: for upon the Accusation, <hi>John White</hi> that fornicating Brownist sitting in the Chair, Mr. <hi>Wiborows</hi> Living was sequestred, and the Profits of it given to one <hi>Burrows,</hi> though the Cure was never neglected, but supplied by Mr. <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borows</hi> friends, to the content and satisfaction of all moderate peaceable men: yet though they had robb'd him of his livelyhood, and given his Wives and Childrens bread to strangers, by most unjust practices, yet his hopes were that his poor Wife and Children should enjoy the accommodation of their dwelling in the Parsonage house: but such is the implacable cruelty and malice of these Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries, that on the tenth of <hi>June</hi> 1643. a Troop of the Rebels came to the Parsonage house, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded entrance: Mrs. <hi>Wiborow</hi> and her Children being alone in the house, she barr'd up the doors against them, and for her better safety retired to an upper room, to which the passage was through a Trap-door, which likewise she made as fast as she
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103099:78"/>
could: all this fortification could not keep these Rebels out, they break open the doors, and make way to the room, where Mrs. <hi>Wiborow</hi> and her Children thought to secure themselves: when they came thither, three of these Rebels set their Pistols at her breast, threatning to shoot her, if she and her Children would not suddenly depart the house, and leave it to a new Master. Mrs. <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borow</hi> replied, That she would rather be killed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doors, than perish without, but withal earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intreated that she might enjoy so much of her Husbands right, as his house to shelter her and her Children, who poor Souls stood about their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crying, and in their natural oratory craving compassion towards their Mother, whom at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word the Rebels threaten to Pistol; but neither the earnest intreaty of the Mother, nor the piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful out-cries of the Children, could prevail with them, they remain as deaf men, void of all pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or bowels of Compassion: nay they violently seize on her, drag her down the stairs, and out of the house into the yard: the poor Children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almost distracted and at their wits end for fear what would become of their Mother, being thus violently drawn out of the house into the yard, there she found <hi>Meriton Simpson</hi> and <hi>Cooke</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questrators, with other attending there to see this joyful spectacle, a poor oppressed Gentlewoman and her small Children cruelly cast out of their own habitation by Rebels and Traitors. As soon as Mrs. <hi>Wiborow</hi> saw them, she presented them with the Kings Proclamation against the Oppression of the Clergy, by the intrusion of factious and schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical persons into the Cures and Revenues of Learned, Orthodox Divines, by Order of one, or
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:103099:79"/>
both pretended Houses of Parliament, contrary to all Law and Justice: which she hoped would have found so much obedience and respect, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store her to her house: This was so far from mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying these Rebels and Schismatiques, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked them to great insolencies: at last when Mrs. <hi>Wiborow</hi> perceived that all her intreaties, and her Childrens tears prevailed nothing, to restore her to her house, she intreated the Sequestrators, that in case she could not be permitted to dwell in her own house, that yet she might have some other place of accommodation provided, to receive her and her Children: <hi>Meriton</hi> insolently replied, <hi>That he would provide his Tumbril,</hi> that is, his Dung-Cart, <hi>to carry her and her Children from Constable to Constable, till she came to her Husband:</hi> after many bitter scoffs and scorns in this her affliction, she desired that if she might not obtain so much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to dwell in her house, yet they would not deny her access to her house, but that she might go in to fetch out provision for her Childrens sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that night: But these Monsters of men would not give her leave: and to compleat this unheard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Tyranny and Oppression, the <hi>Authorized Thieves,</hi> I mean the Commissioners appointed by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended House of Parliament to seize upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states of all Delinquents, and to point out who shall be plundered next, Order, that whatsoever Mr. <hi>Wiborow</hi> had left, should be seized on for the use of that <hi>Thing</hi> which they call a Parliament: thereby to support Rebellion with Robbery and Theft. Instantly they seize on his Corn, and those few Cattle, the remainder of former Plunderings, though they knew it was the life of the Mother and her Children, and that in taking away these,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103099:79"/>
they deprived them of all means of subsistence, and exposed them to extream want, having redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to this miserable condition, to beg or starve: <hi>Now for the comfortless trouble sake of the needy, and because of the deep sighing of the poor, I will up saith the Lord, and will help every one from him that swelleth against him, and will set him at rest:</hi> The good God perform his promise, <hi>Let God arise and let these Enemies of God and Man be scattered.</hi>

But if you please to see the lively Character of a <hi>Malitious, Ingrateful, Cheating Schismatick,</hi> whose Religion is to return <hi>evil</hi> for good, and <hi>hatred</hi> for <hi>good will,</hi> look once more on this <hi>Barnard</hi> the Smith,

and you will conclude it doubtful which is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, his Anvil or his heart. For this Wretch ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. <hi>Dalton</hi> twenty seven Pounds, when the time of payment was come, <hi>Barnard</hi> come to the Church Porch, the place appointed for payment of the Debt, attended with four Rebel Troopers, as witness of the tender of the moneys. Mrs. <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> being there to receive it, he pours it out, she having told it, was putting it up into her Purse; But <hi>Barnard</hi> interrupted her, Saying, <hi>Stay this is for better use than so, it is for the service of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament:</hi> and presently (as the Plot was laid) the Troopers bent their Pistols at her brest, and force the monies from her: nay, before it was lawful by Order and Ordinances to violate all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of Religion and Gratitude, this <hi>Barnard</hi> acknowledged himself much bound to Mr. <hi>Dalton</hi> for many favours having many ways endeared him, thought all things safe which were committed to <hi>Barnards</hi> trust; in this confidence Mr. <hi>Dalton</hi> laid up divers Cooms of Wheat in <hi>Barnards</hi> house, to be a help in time of need: when Mr. <hi>Dalton</hi> was gone, his Wife sent to <hi>Barnards</hi> house to demand some Wheat, this unthankful wretch denied it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that Mr. <hi>Dalton</hi> being a Malignant had no rite or property in those Goods; and therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad her man to come on his ground, threatning that he would run his Pitch-fork in him, if he came thither to make any such Demand: <hi>Ab uno disce om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi>

provoke their <hi>Oppressors</hi> while they implore the compassion of their <hi>friends, Mercurius Civicus</hi> in his Letter, dated <hi>Aug.</hi> 5. 1643. and directed to me, earnestly entreated (their own Presses not daring to publish the truth of their miserable condition) that their sufferings under the <hi>Insolency, Injustice, Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Rapine</hi> of this horrid Rebellion, might be made known to the World by a borrowed pen, and interwoven with those of the <hi>Countrey:</hi> that therefore we may not be wanting to so just requests, nor leave posterity ignorant what transcendent cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties are practised as well within the Walls of that wretched City as without, as oft as they shall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately (by such secret ways of intelligence as the present condition of the times permit) impart their Calamities, I shall according to <hi>Mercurius Civicus</hi> desire, insert them with those of the Country, and so impart them to the World; and though the barbarous Murthers committed on Mr. <hi>Tompkins,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Chaloner,</hi> that second pair of <hi>State Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi> together with the butchery of a peaceable Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen slain by Captain <hi>Harvey:</hi> and the Women slaughtered by Sir <hi>Willam Wallers</hi> Troopers (that ran away at <hi>Roundway Down,</hi> to kill Women and Virgins in <hi>London,</hi> for the unpardonable crime of petitioning for Peace) might justly challenge pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency, yet because the memories of those two worthies are reserved for a peculiar Martyrologue, and these are already imbalmed by the Piety of our Brother <hi>Aulicus,</hi> I shall set before you the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, into which that Rebellious City hath Plunged it self and us, in some other instances.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Tuesday</hi> the 15 of <hi>Aug.</hi> 1643. a Party of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Harvies</hi> Regiment came to one <hi>Walkers</hi> house in <hi>Chancery-Lane,</hi> to Seize on Sir <hi>Ralph Canteril,</hi>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:103099:82"/>
whom they supposed then to have lodged there: on their coming, finding that the Knight was either gone out of Town, or had shifted his lodging, but on diligent inquiry discovering that there was a man in the house that now was, or lately had been Sir <hi>Ralphs</hi> Servant, they apprehend him, and demand where his Master was, and where he had hid his Money, Plate, and Jewels? The man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied that he had left his Masters service, and did know nothing, either where his Master was, or how he had disposed of his Goods: presently they lay violent hands on him, and carry him out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the back-side into the house of Office, there to examin him by Torment: there they rip up the Tiles, and one of the Rebels taking a Cord out of his pocket, fastened one end of it about the poor mans neck, and threw the other end over the rafters of the untiled house: Having him at this posture, they interrogate him again where this (Imaginary) Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure was hid; he returns the same answer, that he could give no account what Sir <hi>Ralph</hi> had done with it: for being to leave his service, he was a stranger to his Masters Actions: Not satisfied with so reasonable an Answer, they hoise him up by the Neck, and let him hang a good distance from the ground, where having hanged a while, they let him down, and examin him again where Sir <hi>Ralph</hi> had bestowed his Money, Plate, and Jewels? The poor man not able to give any other answer to their Query, protests his ignorance, and that if the discovery might save his life, yet he could not redeem it so, for he knew nothing concerning what they asked him: inraged that the man could not Prophecy, (for without that gift he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve them) they suddenly hoise him up to the top
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:103099:83"/>
of the house, and letting go their hold, they let him as suddenly fall to the ground: Being fallen, there he lay for dead without any expression of life: but these barbarous Rebels hoping that there may yet remain some life in him whereon to practise further cruelty, stand by the man, and watch him, and at last perceiving that he was not dead, but that he began to stir and breath, presently they put burning matches between his fingers: hoping by this way of Torment to extort a discovery from him: but in vain, the extremity of this Torment indeed (though half dead as he was) made him cry out and roar in a very lamentable manner, which a Maid-servant of the house hearing, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted at the noise, ran to her Master, and told him, that certainly the Rebels were murthering the man in the house of Office, hereupon Mr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> hastened out, and when he came to the place, found the conjecture of his Servant true, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at so horrid, so inhumane a spectacle, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceded for the poor man, and earnestly desired them, not to defile his ground and habitation with innocent blood: instead of desisting they return the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> answer to <hi>Moses, Who made thee a Ruler and a Judg?</hi> bad him be silent, and withdraw, or else they threatned to use him in like manner: Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> fearing that those perjured persidious Villains, which keep their words in nothing else, might yet be punctual in performance of mischief, not daring to commit himself to their mercy, left them, and went imto his house, where the <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Master</hi> to the Rebels lay sleeping while the Troop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were acting this cruelty, him he raiseth from sleep, and tells him what the Troopers were do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without, who something moved at the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103099:83"/>
went out unto them, and took them off from farther prosecuting their barbarous intentions. But whether or no the man on whom all this cruelty was acted, survived this barbarous usage, is uncertain.</p>
                  <p>As amongst the many blessings wherewith it pleased God to advance the City of <hi>London</hi> far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other Cities either of this, or other Nations of the Christian World, one was their <hi>Clergy:</hi> for a more pious, learned, and laborious Ministry, no people ever enjoyed, <hi>even their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies themselves being Judges:</hi> So amongst the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny crying sins whereby that proud rebellious City hath provoked God to give them up to a <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate sense and hardness of heart</hi> to their own destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, certainly, the <hi>contempt</hi> and <hi>oppression</hi> of their <hi>Clergy</hi> are none of the least: as before the lest Parliament began, a main part of their Religion was to <hi>strive with their Priests,</hi> and to rob them of their maintenance, by all possible arts of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and fraud, so as soon as the Parliament was sate, and the basest of the People were set loose to worrey their Ministers (though never so blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, never so Orthodox, if they did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire with them to innovate both Church and State:) the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves most forward in Petitioning against their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters: yet at first pretended to molest such on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who had expressed greatest zeal to the Order, and decency of Gods worship, professing that for the rest there was no thought to trouble them: but at last having put to flight, or imprisoned <hi>those,</hi> they go and discover plainly, that whatsoever is a <hi>Friend</hi> to the Protestant Religion, as it is establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is their <hi>Enemy</hi>: how many have they silenced, imprisoned, or

banished from their Cures whom heretofore they did magnifie for the undaunted <hi>Champions</hi> of the <hi>Protestant Religion?</hi> and stout opposers of those sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed pretended innovations, which they vainly imagined were the eager endeavours of some men to impose upon the Church: he that knows <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and hath frequented the most thronged Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations there, cannot be ignorant, that Mr. <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im Udall</hi> Parson of S. <hi>Austins</hi> in the <hi>Old Change</hi> near S. <hi>Austines Gate,</hi> is a man of eminent Piety, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Conversation, profound Learning, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable Industry, Preaching constantly every Lords Day twice, and for the Winter half year, if not the whole year, preaching a Lecture at his own Parish every Tuesday in the Afternoon: and if I am not mistaken every Saturday before the first Sunday in the month a Preparatory Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the blessed Sacrament of the <hi>Sords Supper</hi>: and besides all this, he is a man of an affable, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, peaceable Conversation amongst his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: in a word, he was a man of their own vote: and is (without prophanation be it spoken) <hi>a shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and burning light:</hi> and his people for a while much pleased themselves in their choice, and were content to <hi>walk by his light;</hi> but when he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self mistaken in the ends and intentions of the heads of this Rebellion, when he saw that the zeal of some did degenerate into madness and frenzie, and that the endeavours of others (under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Reformation) was to bring in Anarchy and Sacriledg, to devour Gods Portion, and the poor remainder of the Patrimony of the Church, he did strongly and powerfully bend both his tongue and pen against them: against Sacriledg he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished that learned Tract, called <hi>A Coal from the Altar:</hi> against Anarchy he declared himself for
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103099:84"/>
Episcopacy, and the established Lyturgy: and published another Book called <hi>Communion Comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> in which by many impregnable Arguments he proves a high Conveniency, if not a necessity, for that most laudable custom of having Rails about the Lords Table: These were in the Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques opinion Crimes enough to unsaint a man, nay, had S. <hi>Paul</hi> himself been now in the flesh, and preached against Sacriledg and Anarchy, there is no doubt, but there would have been some found to petition against him, and <hi>John White</hi> sitting in the Chair, as undoubtedly he had been voted a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Minister at a Committee: but because when these Books were published, Injustice and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion did not march so furiously, nor were grown so frontless and impudent to seize on innocency it self, not slurr'd with slanders and calumnies, Mr. <hi>Udall</hi> sate something quiet, some murmurings there were, but his former Reputation in the City bore him up against the Obloquy of private discontent: the Faction found it no easie matter to brand Mr. <hi>Udall</hi> with <hi>Popery,</hi> or <hi>Popishly affected,</hi> or these slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to make any impression in that estimation which the people had of him: but at last when they came openly to defie their Sovereign, the <hi>Lords Anointed,</hi> and it was almost Treason but to name the 13.

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:103099:85"/>
Prisoner, being aged, of very weak and infirm bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, his strength exhausted with continual labours in Preaching the word of God, visiting the sick, and in execution of their ministerial Functions, in performance of which in his own person few of his Brethren were more conscientious: And <hi>lastly,</hi> they cast him out of his dwelling house: But when they came to seize on his house, they found one impediment, which unless they could find some art to remove, they could not take full possession of it: Mrs. <hi>Udall</hi> (besides the infirmities of age) was lame, and it had been monstrous inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity to take her by violence and carry her out of her house, not knowing where to dispose of her, but in the open street: Therefore to gain her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and prevent clamour until the feat was done, they tell the good old Gentlewoman that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had a tender respect unto her years, and to her present infirmities: and therefore though they had ordered to dispossess her of that house, yet they did not mean to leave her harbourless, but had out of the abundance of their goodness pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided another house to receive her: She good old Woman neither awed by fear, nor won by their perswasions and promises, was taken up by two men brought in by him that had broken open three locks, and entred the house by force, and carried out of her house into the street, there they set her down in a Chair, and so leave this weak infirm Matron, of a long time not accustomed to the open air, nor being able to go out of doors in three or four years before, unless unto the Church, exposed her (a sad spectacle of the Rebels cruelty) to the mercy of Wind and Weather.</p>
                  <p>The Rebels in their march towards <hi>Gloucester,</hi> seized on Sr. <hi>Tho. Hide</hi> a <hi>Bedfordshire</hi> Man, whose
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:103099:85"/>
sordid Covetousness had made him so far forget all Duty and Loyalty to his Sovereign, as that he refused to assist him either in his Person or his purse: but because either his Estate lay nearer to the <hi>Power</hi> of the Rebels, than to the Kings <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection:</hi> a Consideration which in these Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal rebellious times is admitted as a just Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, either for <hi>Neutrality,</hi> or ready <hi>Compliance</hi> with the Rebels, so far as to submit to all Taxes and Impositions laid on them, a most traiterous and irreligious liberty and dispensation of Conscience, which if all men had made use of, the Kings Crown might long before this have been thrown down to the ground: Or else conceiving it a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unlikely, if not an impossible thing for the King to withstand their power, who had not only by Lies and Slanders stoln away the hearts of the People, but had seized on all his <hi>Castles, Towns, Forts, Magazines:</hi> did contribute to the Rebels aid, and wholly complied with them, not so much out of <hi>judgment,</hi> as <hi>fear:</hi> thinking that this compliance would be the security of his Estate, and turn to his great advantage: but his Wealth was so well known, that bare Compliance, and small Contributions must not serve his turn, he must <hi>bleed more freely:</hi> They seize him the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth part, and that highly set: This demand struck his heart like pangs of death; and he that was so forward in petty assistances, now discovered the love of himself to be more than that of the holy Cause, and refused to part with more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: wherefore in recompence of his former good deeds, they seize on his Person, and carry him captive in their Army, and suffered his Servant to walk along by him, leading a horse in his

hand, while his Master the Knight was chained arm to arm with another Prisoner, and was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to beat it on the hoof: Thus did he march for three days on foot, coupled with another Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, and that Prisoner, as we are informed, is Doctor <hi>Stubbing,</hi> Doctor in Divinity, whom like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Rebels gathered up in their march, and taking him from his Cure, added him to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Captives: So soon can these Rebels forget former aids, if men do not comply with them, and answer their expectation in every thing, and indeed what measure their dearest friends are to expect from them, if they fail them in any particular, not running into the same excess of Madness and Treason as they do, and shall not shew themselves ready at a call (to their perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual infamy, contrary to the Religion which they profess, the Oaths which they have taken, and the solemn Protestations which they have made) rush into the damnable sin of Rebellion, and give the right hand of fellowship to the Rebels here, to assist them in so unnatural a War against their own gracious native Sovereign, we may fully learn by a Prayer (for now they have turned their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prayers into sin, being no better than very Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and Pasquils) lately made by Mr. <hi>Bowlstrode,</hi> Son to Colonel <hi>Bowlstrode,</hi> a factious Rebel of <hi>Buckinghamshire,</hi> before his Sermon at <hi>Horton</hi> near <hi>Colebrooke,</hi> which that you may see what <hi>Spirit of Prayer and Supplication</hi> it is, of which they boast, and that the Nation whom it concerns may see what opinion the factious Preachers here have of them, unless they will serve their vile purposes and ingage themselves as deeply (which God forbid) in the present Rebellion as themselves, we have here inserted.</p>

                  <p>UPon Friday the 18. of <hi>Aug.</hi> 1643. Mr. <hi>Squire</hi> of <hi>Little S. Bartholomews, London,</hi> having this present Rebellion upon several Rates, Taxes and Loans, disbursed near a Thousand pounds, was sent unto for a new Sum towards the maintenance of the Holy Cause; but he foreseeing, that as long as their Purses were open to foment this unnatural War, there would be no end of it till their Estates were exhausted, and the wealthiest amongst them reduced to beggery, and a morsel of bread, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a denyal, yet withal professed his readiness to have supplyed them if he had been provided: and his Wife to indear themselves, and to shew how well affected they were to the Cause, wished that all the <hi>Malignants</hi> in <hi>London</hi> were plundered, and then there would be less cause to call so often on the Well-affected for so great Supplies, not imagining (good Woman) that her Husband might be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred shortly amongst the <hi>Malignants:</hi> or, that to be wealthy and not pour out all, as often as the heads
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103099:87"/>
of this Rebellion should call for it, was in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, high <hi>Malignity</hi>: for next day, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their former complyance with the Rebels in so great a measure, six men with Pistols were sent to Master <hi>Squires</hi> House, under pretence to search for Arms, but indeed to find out a hoard of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which either their own Jealousie, grounded on the general received opinion of his Wealth, or the treachery of some that knew the House had suggested unto them. After some small search (though Mr. <hi>Squire</hi> thought that his Treasure had been close enough hid) instead of Arms they find four thousand pounds, a rich booty, and very greedily seized upon. At last, Mistris <hi>Squire</hi> finding her self so unexpectedly in the number and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Malignants, robbed of so great a Sum, fell into a swoon, and for fear she should be recall'd to pursue the Injury with just Clamors and Expostula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when Strong-waters were brought to relieve and comfort her surprised Spirits, the Rebels would not permit it to be administred unto her: but left Nature to the work of its own recovery, without the assistance of any borrowed help. Of this Four thousand pounds, Eight hundred was due to a Son in Law of Mr. <hi>Squires,</hi> a Creature of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and a great Friend to the Cause; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to redeem the rest, Mr. <hi>Squire</hi> freely offered to give the Parliament (as those tame People call the Faction of both Houses) the Sum of Three hundred pounds, so the rest might be restored un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: but all in vain, it was judged a very high <hi>Symptome of Malignity</hi> to hide Four thousand pounds, and suffer the <hi>Holy League</hi> to be endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered for want of Supplies, and therefore as a just punishment for his Coldness, and want of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103099:88"/>
Zeal to the good Cause in hand, it was wholly taken from him without restitution (for ought we yet know) of a farthing: and indeed what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the Rich either of <hi>London,</hi> or any other place, cursed with the Tyranny and Oppression of this Rebellion, are to expect from their Hands (when the Necessities of Supplies shall press upon them) the World may read in this Warrant, directed from <hi>Nathanael Fiennes,</hi> in the time of his reign in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Gunning</hi> the younger of that City: which for the plain English that it speaks, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it contains a perfect discovery of their Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions when occasion shall serve, we have here inserted.</p>

                  <p>On Sunday morning, being the ninth of <hi>July,</hi> 1643. in time of Divine Service, Colonel <hi>Morley,</hi> the <hi>Crooked Rebel of Sussex,</hi> came towards <hi>Hasting,</hi> one of the Cinque Ports; but in his March being discover'd, presently notice was given to Mr. <hi>Hinson,</hi> Curate of <hi>All Saints,</hi> who knowing that one end of the Colonel's <hi>Sabbath-days Journey,</hi> was to apprehend him, was compelled to break off Divine Service in the mid'st, and fly into a Wood near at hand, there to hide himself: The Colonel being entered the Town, scattered the Body of his Horse into several parts, to intercept all passages out of the Town: and having secured the Ports, he summons the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Jurats,</hi> and demands the Arms of the Town: to which he found ready obedience; for presently the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Jurats</hi> sent their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to command all the Inhabitants to deliver up their Arms, which was done accordingly; and one of the Jurats, <hi>Fray</hi> by name, furnished the Colonel with a Waggon, he sent them away to <hi>Battell,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Town in <hi>Sussex,</hi> some five Miles from <hi>Hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>: that night some Soldiers lay in the Church, where Mr. <hi>Hinson</hi> officiated, where one <hi>Wicker,</hi> a common Soldier, getting up into the Pulpit, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto his Fellows: and to shew the Fruits of so good Doctrine, going out of the Church, either
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:103099:89"/>
the Preacher, or one of his Auditory, stole away the Surpless; <hi>Ralph Mills,</hi> the honest Parish Clark, to recover it, complained to their Captain <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Cockeram</hi> of <hi>Rye,</hi> but received no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, but this, <hi>Do not you think he loves a Smock as well as you? Morley</hi> being now Master of the Town, began to exercise his power given him for the good of the Kingdom, and the preservation of the Subjects property, and demanded a Sum of Monies from some of the <hi>Jurats,</hi> which they paid him, and because they came off so readily, he demanded more, which they refusing, he took them with him Prisoners to <hi>Battell</hi>: where having stayed but a night, they return with a Warrant next day signed by <hi>Morley,</hi> which they undertook to execute upon such Persons as themselves had designed for Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Imprisonment: whereof Mr. <hi>Car,</hi> the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of St. <hi>Clements</hi> in <hi>Hasting,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hinson,</hi> were the chiefest. Mr. <hi>Car</hi> that Sunday was not at home, being fled to prevent surprizal: but hearing that Colonel <hi>Morley</hi> was gone to <hi>Battell,</hi> and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Storm to be now blown over, he resolved to return to <hi>Hasting,</hi> and being on the way thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he met <hi>Fray</hi> the <hi>Jurat,</hi> who was one of the Combination to execute <hi>Morley</hi>'s Warrant, and apprehend him: as <hi>Fray</hi> was drilling Mr. <hi>Car</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, by chance one Mr. <hi>Breame</hi> met them, and seeing Mr. <hi>Car</hi> so familiarly conversing with a <hi>Judas</hi> that was resolved to betray him, called Mr. <hi>Car</hi> aside to speak with him; what he said is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, but in all probability he discovered to Master <hi>Car</hi> the danger in which he was, for imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately he left <hi>Fray</hi>'s company, and rode back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. <hi>Fray</hi> thus unexpectedly robb'd of his prey, instantly informed Colonel <hi>Morley,</hi> that Master
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103099:89"/>
                     <hi>Breame</hi> had frayed away the Bird, that was so near going into the snare: <hi>Morley</hi> presently sends some Troopers to apprehend Master <hi>Breame,</hi> and at what sum he did redeem this Crime, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. On the Tuesday after <hi>Morleys</hi> coming to <hi>Hasting,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hinson</hi> returned home: and that day, the <hi>Jurats,</hi> that <hi>Morley</hi> took with him, being come back, summoned the rest of their Brethren unto the Town-Hall, where they acquainted them with the Contents of their new Warrant: who with joynt consent, promise their best endeavors to put it in execution: to this purpose, having picked out of the Town a sufficient number to assist them, and execute their Commands; and having put their names in the Warrant with their own, they bind them by the Religion, and strict bond of an Oath, to do what they would have them, without ever specifying any Particulars, wherein they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to exercise their Obedience, until they should give them in charge what they were to do: Nay, not only so, but having received their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, they swear them not to reveal what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands were laid on them, to any body, no not to their own Wives, until they had executed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; and when some of these assistants startled at this <hi>Jesuitical implicite Obedience,</hi> to know to what in particular their Oath should bind them: <hi>Wenham,</hi> a Factious <hi>Jurat,</hi> replyed, That they must swear in general, and afterwards they should know the particulars. <hi>Thomas Staple,</hi> one of the Assistants, being pressed to take this Oath, rejoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Then you may make us swear, and the business we swear to, may be to knock our Fathers in the head, or betray them: Wenham</hi> (most convincingly) replyed, <hi>That if they would not swear, they had authority for
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:103099:90"/>
their refusal, to Imprison them for a year:</hi> The rest adding, <hi>That they need not be so scrupulous, though they did not know what they swore unto, it was no harm, for they had taken the same Oath themselves to do that which they were to assist them in:</hi> And so, partly by fear, and partly by the inducement of the Jurats example, they took an Oath upon the Holy Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists, to assist the Jurats in what they were to do, not knowing what, and to be secret, until it was done. Sure the Oath of <hi>Canonical Obedience,</hi> and the so much decryed <hi>&amp; caetera,</hi> must now for ever rest in Peace, and never more be maliciously and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly traduced after this most <hi>Papistical, Jesuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Puritanical</hi> practice.</p>
                  <p>Having thus engaged these men by an Oath, to do any thing which they shall command them, they then think them sufficiently prepared to receive the Mysteries of the Warrant which now they reveal unto them, and tell them, that they must appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend Master <hi>Hinson,</hi> and some others nominated in the Warrant: in obedience therefore to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, they presently go to Mr. <hi>Hinson,</hi> and seize on him in his Lodging: and being brought before the Mayor and his Brethren the <hi>Jurats,</hi> he never questioned by what Authority he was apprehended, but only told them, That he had not done any thing that deserved this usage; Presently <hi>Wenham</hi> replyed, That he had highly deserved it, because he read the Kings Declarations. After this, all the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats went out, one by one, and left Mr. <hi>Hinson</hi> lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up with one Mr. <hi>Parker,</hi> whom they had a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before committed, because he would not pay for the carriage of some Ordnance to <hi>Rye,</hi> a most Factious Town, not far off: Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> was that night removed from the Town-Hall, but Master

                     <hi>Hinson</hi> was left there all night, strongly guarded by eight Bill-men, having no other Bed but a Bench: next day Master <hi>Parker</hi> (who had the favor to be lodged that Night in a Serjeants House) desirous to see his Fellow-Prisoner, prevailed with his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord to go along with him to visit Master <hi>Hinson:</hi> of which when <hi>Wenham</hi> had notice, he told <hi>Bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denham</hi> (for so was the Serjeants name) that he deserved for this to be laid by the heels himself: which check so awed many of Mr. <hi>Hinson</hi>'s Friends, that they durst not visit him for fear of Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the Mayor and <hi>Wenham</hi> command the Maid-servant that attended him, not to carry any Letters from him, and being examined by them whether she had conveyed any from him already; upon her denyal, <hi>Barlow</hi> a factious Schismatick (who because heretofore his Neighbors of <hi>Hasting</hi> refused to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with him in petitioning against Episcopacy, joyned and subscribed with those of <hi>Rye</hi>) told her, that she deserved to be put into the <hi>Ducking-house</hi> (a Prison for Women) for denying it: That night <hi>Bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denham</hi> the Serjeant was commanded to carry Mr. <hi>Hinson</hi> out of the Town-hall, and put him into the Common Goal; which the Serjeant refusing, that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie Fellow <hi>Wenham</hi> told him, That he deserved to be committed himself, for refusing to perform his office: hereupon, by vertue of this Oath, they command four of the Men whom they had sworn to apprehend Mr. <hi>Hinson,</hi> to tell him, That he must exchange his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the Town-hall, for the common Goal, whither they presently led him; there they lock him fast up in a loathsom place, where there was but one short bench, and no company but a Tinker, and he none of the Jovialists neither, for the stubborn sullen Tinker pleading seniority in the place, took posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

of the Bench, and most unsociably kept it all night, not interchanging with Mr. <hi>Hinson</hi> his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for a walk for variety sake, but left him one while to walk, and another while to sleep on that floor, in which he was forced to do the necessary acts of Nature: while he lay in this loathsom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, four of the <hi>Jurats; Jurats,</hi> I mean four that had taken the Oath, to do whatever was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, came to the Goal, and professed to Mr. <hi>Hinson</hi> their hearty sorrow that they ever had a hand in his Attachment, intreated him, that he would not think evil of them, for they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to do that for which they were now sorry: And <hi>Thomas Staple</hi> that (as before you heard) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulated so freely, and pleaded against the taking the Oath before he was awed to take it, shewing the monstrous evil in which it might ingage them, openly exclaimed against the Mayor and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, wishing that the Plague from God might light upon them, for insnaring their Consciences with such an Oath; when not only Religion, but right Reason might have told him, and the rest, That their Sin was to take an unlawful Oath, it had been no sin to break it: while Master <hi>Hinton</hi> lay thus in the Goal, one Master <hi>Besanno,</hi> a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor at Law interceded for him, and earnestly intreated, that he might be removed from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Goal, and committed to safe Custody in some Chamber in the Town, but could not prevail: at last, after three Weeks Imprisonment, upon Mr. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanno</hi>'s request, seconded by Mr. <hi>Brian</hi> (hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>Jurate</hi> of <hi>Hasting,</hi> but now removed to <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,</hi> as too honest for such a Fraternity as he left behind him) Mr. <hi>Hinson</hi> was sent with a strong Guard to Colonel <hi>Morley</hi>: by whom he was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

to <hi>London</hi> to Learned <hi>Miles Corbet,</hi> who committed him to the Custody of a Messenger; and having no particular accusation, but a general charge, and finding no hopes to be brought to a hearing, but perceiving himself designed (as others before him had been) to long attendance and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious delays, he withdrew himself from his Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Oppression, and escaping to <hi>Oxford,</hi> put himself under the Kings Protection.</p>

of the heads of the Faction in Parliament and the People: And though it seemed good to the heads of the Faction, by restoring these turbulent men, to brave that Authority by which they were just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly censured, yet, being restored, all were not thought to be of equal concernment: As for <hi>Bastwick,</hi> if any man labouring under any Indisposition (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that to the present established Government) had a mind to be a Patient, and put himself into the hands of a Mad-man, he might do as he pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at his own peril: every man was left to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of his own choice: So for <hi>Prinne,</hi> if any man desired to retain him of his Counsel, it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Client to give, and him to receive his Fee, but all this was but voluntary: no man was constrained to be a <hi>Patient</hi> to the one, nor a <hi>Client</hi> to the other: for the intended Rebellion might well go forward, though <hi>Bastwick</hi> never wrote an <hi>Apothecaries Bill,</hi> or <hi>Prinne</hi> pleaded at the Bar: But for <hi>Burton,</hi> (a main Engine to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the design in hand) it concerned them to restore him, not only to a Liberty of the exercise of his calling at large, but likewise to invest him in his former Cure in particular; from which, by the just sentence of Law he was ejected: To this purpose no arts were left unattempted, by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Agents, for the heads of this Rebellion, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store <hi>Burton</hi> to his Parsonage of S. <hi>Matthews</hi> in <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-street, London:</hi> by unjust molestations they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to weary out Mr. <hi>Chestlen</hi> that succeeded him (but not immediately) in it, to relinquish his Cure, and make way for this Trumpet of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; that so, what was not feizable in Law, might yet be effected by horrible injustice and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression: First therefore some of Mr. <hi>Chestlens</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishoners,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:103099:93"/>
(but <hi>Burtons</hi> old Disciples, levened with his Schismatical Doctrin) deny to pay him his Tiths, or any other accustomed Duties: nor are they content with their own denial, but by earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est perswasions, and other means they labour to draw other men into the like obstinacy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versness: nor did they stick openly to profess that they did this, that by unjust vexations they might weary out Mr. <hi>Chestlen,</hi> and make way for <hi>Burton:</hi> hereupon (the <hi>Ecclesiastical Court</hi> being suppressed, which otherwise have cognizance of the Causes of Tiths of <hi>London,</hi> nor can there any prohibition be justly granted as <hi>Coram non Judice,</hi> the Statute only enabling the Lord Mayor to be Judge, if the person grieved think fit to appeal unto him, but no way disabling the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> or abolishing his power) Mr. <hi>Chestlen</hi> petitioned (as the Statute in that case provides) the Lord Major that then was Sir <hi>Edmund Wright</hi>: To the hearing before the Lord Mayor came little <hi>Isaac Pennington,</hi> no ways interested in the cause, but only to give counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to Mr. <hi>Chestlen</hi>'s Parishoners: being there, he openly reviled Mr. <hi>Chestlen,</hi> calling him <hi>Saucy Jack, Brazen-fac'd Fellow,</hi> and the like; nay he threatned the Judge, thinking by this to stave him off from doing Justice, who bravely scorning the threats of so contemptible a <hi>Mushrome,</hi> in a just indignation replied, <hi>What, shall I be afraid to do Justice?</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the event shewed that he was not afraid, for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a full hearing of the Cause, the Lord Mayor gave sentence for Mr. <hi>Chestlen,</hi> and ordered the Parishoners to pay their Tiths: <hi>Tillat</hi> a Linnen Draper, one of the Citizens that was sued, refused to obey the Lord Mayor's Decree: and therefore the time limited in the Decree being expired, the Lord Mayor accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the power given him by the Statute of the 37 of

                     <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. committed <hi>Tillat</hi> to Prison without Bail, or mainprize, until he did submit to the sentence as the Statute gives him power: But see the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of the great pretenders to the maintenance of the Laws of the Land, <hi>Tillat</hi> had not stood committed many days, before two of the House of Commons (as the Keeper of <hi>Newgate</hi> sayes) in the name of the House of Commons, command him to be set at liberty, which accordingly was done, though he were in upon <hi>Execution,</hi> and the Debt not satisfied: every man wondring at, but no man daring to question so illegal an action. When this way took no effect, they joyned their Purses to vex him with an <hi>Action of Ejectment,</hi> threatning to spend five hundred pounds but they would out him of his Living: but presently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted those intentions as not seizable. After this, they slaunder him for Preaching <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianism:</hi> which unjust scandal so prevailed in the City, that he could not pass the streets without affronts and jeers put upon him: they disswade his Parishoners from hearing him, telling them, that they would be damn'd if they lived under his Ministery, they branded them with the name of <hi>Malignants,</hi> if they frequented their own Church, and procured them to be deeply Taxed in all Sess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In a word, that nothing might be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own malice, and Mr. <hi>Chestlen</hi>'s vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, they threw menacing Libels into his House, laid wait in the Pewes of his Church, while o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers provoked him to express himself in the great differences of the times, hoping to intangle him in his words: and examined his Conversation in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry places where he lived, even from his Childhood, to that time, hoping to find something whence
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:103099:94"/>
to frame an Accusation against him: When all these malicious Courses would not effect the thing they aimed at, they go from house to house for hands to a Petition against him, to the House of Commons, pretending that he had Preached false Doctrin, and made it the subject matter of their Petition: and if any man refused to subscribe (as many did, because they could not testifie the truth of the Petition) in their <hi>Spirit of meekness,</hi> they called them <hi>Malignants, Papists,</hi> and <hi>Enemies to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:</hi> however it is too well known, that two or three men (though the very dregs of the People) petitioning against Orthodox Ministers, have in the judgment and acceptance of the Faction of the House of Commons, out-poised the rest of the Parish, though infinitely beyond them as in Number so in Quality: their Testimony being rejected with much acrimony and sharpness, when the other Libels have gained credit and reputation with them: Therefore about <hi>March,</hi> 1641. The Schismaticks of Mr. <hi>Chestlens</hi> Parish presented a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition against him to the House of Commons, in the name of the whole Parish, though three parts of four protested against it under their own hands: When it was presented, <hi>Pennington</hi> and <hi>Venne</hi> ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly urged that it might be read, pleading in their drivelling, railing Oratory, that he was a very dangerous man, fit to be looked after: To satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their Importunity, the Witnesses (who as their manner is, were never sworn, and yet were both Witnesses and Accusers) were produced and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined at the Bar, and upon examination the Petition was thrown out as frivolous, but like ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger bloud-hounds not giving off the pursuit, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at one loss, upon <hi>Easter Eve,</hi> to shew the World
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:103099:94"/>
that <hi>malice is part of a Puritans preparation to the Sacrament,</hi> when the House was very thin, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants of the House being in their Closets, close at their devotions to prepare themselves for the great Feast at hand, and when all private busines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses by order of both Houses were laid aside (for as yet all opinion of the sanctity of the ancient <hi>Festivals</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> those venerable anniversary memorials of Gods great blessings to mankind, was not lost amongst them) <hi>Penning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and <hi>Venne</hi> prevailed to have this foiled ejected Petition to be revived and read again in the House, and the Patrons of Justice and Integrity being then absent, the Petition was referred to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee for scandalous Ministers: so they are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to call all Orthodox, conscientious Ministers, who abhor their Rebellion, and refuse to comply with them in their seditious practices: and that no time might be lost, in Easter-week, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee sate purposely for this business: to which there was a full confluence of seditious Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal People from all quarters of the City; that so nothing might be wanting to this Triumph: while Mr. <hi>Chestlen</hi> was thus tied to a tedious chargeable attendance; <hi>God to whom appertain the Issues of death,</hi> smote <hi>Tillat</hi> the main promoter of Mr. <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stlens</hi> troubles with the Plague: of which he died: with whom also for the present died Mr. <hi>Chestlens</hi> trouble and vexation: and though some (that think that all acts of providence are aimed point-blank at them) having such an oportunity as this, would interpret this to their own Interest, as a sign of personal favour to them, yet not dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to press into the hidden will of God, nor mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selves of familiar acquaintance with his
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:103099:95"/>
Counsels; I shall not make any inference from hence, but leave every man to abound in his own sense, only thus much we say, <hi>Tillat</hi> being dead, the hot prosecution of Mr. <hi>Chestlen,</hi> for a while lay dead too: when all these endeavours could not re-estate <hi>Burton</hi> in the Parsonage, some of the Factious of the Parish combine to make him their Lecturer, and perhaps better approved of him as their Lecturer, than their Parson: to this purpose cunningly, and on feigned pretences they get some subscriptions of the Parishoners, and annexing them to a Petition, for which they were never intended, preferred it in their own names, and the names of the rest, to the House of Commons, that <hi>Burton</hi> might be their Lecturer: which was no sooner proposed than granted, and an Order presently drawn up to give <hi>Burton</hi> power to Preach in Mr. <hi>Chestlen</hi>'s Pulpit, which Mr. <hi>Chestlen</hi> resolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opposing, kindled such Coals against him as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards fired him out of the City: for since Mr. <hi>Chestlen</hi> will not give way to <hi>Burton</hi> to be part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with him in his Pulpit, they resolve to give him possession of the whole, by removing Mr. <hi>Chestlen</hi> totally from his Cure: To this purpose Mr. <hi>Case</hi> sends to the Faction in Mr. <hi>Chestlen</hi>'s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish to frame some accusation against him; in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to so ghostly Counsel, Mr. <hi>Chestlen</hi> is presently accused to the House of Commons for Preaching a seditious Sermon on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 23. of <hi>October,</hi> that very day whereon the Battel was fought at <hi>Edge-Hill:</hi> The subject of the Sermon in truth, being nothing else, but an earnest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to his Parishoners to perswade them to constancy in the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> perseverance in the fear of <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King</hi>: presently a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

                  <p>Next Morning being <hi>Saturday</hi> was this (righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) sentence put in execution: Thus to make way to reduce <hi>Burton,</hi> a Stigmatized infamous Scis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick to his former place, was Mr. <hi>Chestlen</hi> doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to banishment and captivity: in a remote place from his Father, his Wife and Family, into a noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Goal, where he was made a Companion to Theives and Felons; in a Town, where 'twas little less than death to be Loyal: or as themselves phrase it, to be <hi>Caesars Friend:</hi> A Town in which they that sent him thither, could not but know that they exposed his life to the fury of an inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:103099:97"/>
Fanatick People, and not long before had not only murthered Sir <hi>John Lucas,</hi> his Mother, and Sister, together with Mr. <hi>Newcomin,</hi> one of their own Ministers, and for this had received pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick thanks from the House of Commons for their forwardness and zeal to the service of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Lastly, in a Town arrived at that high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of madness, that the <hi>Independent Church</hi> is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly practised in it, and the Mayor banished one of the Town for a Malignant and a Cavalier whose name was <hi>Parsons,</hi> and gave this learned reason for this exemplary peice of Justice, <hi>Because it was an ominous name:</hi> While Mr. <hi>Chestlen</hi> remained in this durance, if any man durst visit him, it was at his peril, he was in danger to be Plundered and brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the dangerous name of a Malignant. They raised reports of great resort of Cavaliers to him, and of Arms brought unto him, insomuch that Alderman <hi>Barrington</hi> told the Committee, that their Town was not in safety because of Mr. <hi>Chest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> who poor man, had no other endeavour than how to free himself from the loathsom nastiness of his Prison: To this end many Petitions were delivered to the House of Commons, that he might be delivered from the Goal to some private house, which boon after much and earnest prosecution by Mrs. <hi>Chestlen,</hi> and his friends, was obtained: Having an Order to exchange his Goal for a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate house, Mr. <hi>Hammon</hi> an honest Gentleman dwelling in the Town, entertained Mr. <hi>Chestlen:</hi> but for his Charity incurred the hatred of the Common People, for whereas before he lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and in good estimation amongst his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, now for harbouring Mr. <hi>Chestlen,</hi> and for this and other actions being under the Jealousie

of the <hi>Crime</hi> of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> they call him <hi>Cavalier,</hi> they threaten to call him up to the Parliament, and at last were as good as their word, for upon their Complaint, he was sent for up to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and committed for receiving Mr. <hi>Chestlen</hi> into his house: though in reason he might safely conclude, that, that Order of the House which gave Mr. <hi>Chestlen</hi> liberty to remove to another house, did withal give that house liberty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain him: Thus continued Mr. <hi>Chestlen</hi> in this exile and Imprisonment from <hi>October</hi> 1642. until the <hi>February</hi> following, when the Kings express Warrant being sent for his release, having the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity now and then to go abroad and take the air, he left the Warrant for the Goaler to make use of for his best advantage, while he came away to <hi>Oxford</hi> and put himself under the Kings Protection: Since that, in <hi>London</hi> they have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up his house, and Plundered his Goods: a common evil incident to all the Kings faithful Subjects, which are within the Verge of the Rebels usurped power.</p>

                        <hi>Mr.</hi> Fowler <hi>Parson of</hi> Minchin-Hampton <hi>in</hi> Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestershire, <hi>his Wife, and Children barbarously used, and his House plundered by the Rebels.

                  </argument>
                  <p>ON <hi>New-years day,</hi> 1643. seventeen Soldiers sent by Captain <hi>Jeremy Buck,</hi> came to Mr. <hi>Henry Fowlers</hi> house, Parson of <hi>Minchin-Hampton,</hi> in the County of <hi>Gloucester</hi>; being entred the house, they find Mr. <hi>Fowler</hi> sitting (as the season of the year required) by the fire side, presently they seize on him, and tell him, that he is their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner: and though he instantly submitted unto them without any the least resistence, yet to wreck their own malice, and the malice of him that sent them, upon him, one of the Rebels takes him by the throat, and holds the point of his Sword at his breast, two more (on each side one) present their Pistols at him, another shakes his Pole-axe over his head, others strike him with their Pole-axes; threatned he is on every side with varieties of death. All <hi>Smite him with the tongue,</hi> they rail at him, objecting against him as heinous crimes, First, that he read the Common-Prayers at length, and that he had published the Kings Proclamations with a loud voice; and then with
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103099:98"/>
renewed fury they assault him again: they beat him with their Pole-axes, and call him Mass-Priest, Rogue, Rascal, and tell him, <hi>Sirrah, you can furnish the King with a Musquet, a Corslet, and a Light-Horse, but thou old Knave, thou canst not find any thing at all for the Parliament:</hi> And then to work they fall again with their Pole-axes, and beat and bruise him in most parts of his body; so that being aged, (no less than Threescore and two years old) and being not yet perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered of a former lameness in one of his hips, though he were in a probable way towards it, by this barbarous usage, being so cruelly beaten, and tugged, and haled by them, he is made a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cripple, irrecoverably lame, without all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of recovering of his Limbs: All this inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity was practised on Mr. <hi>Fowler</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his Wife and Children, the Wife in the behalf of her Husband, the Children in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of their Father, humbly entreating on their knees, that they would have compassion on him, and not murther a peaceable man in his own house. While some of these Rebels were executing this cruelty on his Person, others go up into his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and Chambers, and take away all that was of good value, and portable. And having crippled the Master of the Family, and rifled his house, like the true Servants of that Master whom they serve, the Devil, they leave him, but it was but for a season.</p>
                  <p>Now though the present sense of these suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, could not be but very great to an aged man, and one labouring under former infirmities, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to have his sufferings imbittered by the reproachful railings of the Rebels, and the mocks
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:103099:99"/>
and mowes of Captain <hi>Bucks</hi> friends and Kindred, who stood by jeering, and clapt their hands for joy, applauding the exact execution of <hi>Bucks</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, given his Soldiers concerning Mr. <hi>Fowler,</hi> yet the sad effects which followed were evidence enough how cruel his usage was: First, Mr. <hi>Fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> presently upon the Rebels departure, fell into an extream bleeding, which continued, and could not be stanched in six hours and more, by which great outlet of Spirits, his strength was so much exhausted, that the was not able to stand. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> the next day after his bleeding, what with the loss of so much blood, and what with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence offered to his whole body, the <hi>Retentive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,</hi> was so weakened, that his urine came from him insensibly, and in this wretched condition he continued very near a month. <hi>Lastly,</hi> by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny confusions and knocks which he received on his head with their Pole-axes he lost his hearing, which he hath not perfectly recovered unto this day. And now after all this barbarous usage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains there yet any thing else to be added to his sufferings? was not their malice satisfied, and these outrages (designed to be committed on him) compleated yet? No, Captain <hi>Bucke</hi> knew that it would not be lawful always to commit murther, and rob those that are quiet in the Land, and therefore resolved to make use of the present op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity: he was not ignorant that the wages of a faithful Servant to the Rebellion was <hi>full licence to do any thing that can satisfie Lust, private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, or Avarice:</hi> And therefore in <hi>July</hi> last, <hi>Bucke</hi> himself, not like a Captain of Soldiers, but a Ring-leader to a <hi>Rout of Rogues,</hi> came to Mr. <hi>Fowlers</hi> house at <hi>Minching-Hampton,</hi> and most thiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:103099:99"/>
broke open the Window of his Sons Study, and so entered the house: In the Study they found Rich Treasure which they did not know, being indeed without a Metaphor <hi>Pearl before Swine,</hi> for young Mr. <hi>Fowler,</hi> a Practitioner it seems in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, had in his Study <hi>Extract of Pearl, Aurum Potabile, Confections of Amber,</hi> a great quantity of <hi>Compound</hi> Waters, a good proportion of <hi>Pearl</hi> in Boxes, a Box full of <hi>Bezoar Stone,</hi> with many other things of admirable use, for the preservation of the Life of Man, and of very great value, all which they took and brake in pieces, and tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them under foot, made them utterly unuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful either for themselves or others. One of Mr. <hi>Fowlers</hi> Daughters in a just indignation at so great wast of things so precious, told <hi>Bucke</hi> that he might be ashamed to spoil things of that use and value; <hi>Bucke</hi> (a rude untutored man as he is) called her Whore, and with his Pole-ax gave her a blow on the Neck, and struck her down, and being ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen again, again he strikes her down with his Pole-ax, nay, to pursue the glorious victory, he strikes her down a third time, and had she been able to rise from the floor, questionless, had struck her down a fourth time. The compassionate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mrs. <hi>Fowler</hi> standing by, and seeing her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thus barbarously used, to redeem her from this cruelty, resolved to expose her own person to the fury of this mad Beast, and therefore interposing, asked <hi>Bucke,</hi> whether he thought she could endure to see her Child murthered before her face: but as soon as Mrs. <hi>Fowler</hi> came within his reach, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard either to her Age, or Sex, he caught her by the Throat, knocked her down, and being down, kicked her, and trampled on her with his
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:103099:100"/>
feet. At last having acted what cruelty he pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (according to the Latitude of that Tacite Commission given every Captain of the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion) on Mrs. <hi>Fowler</hi> and her Daughter, he and his Rabble Plundered the House, and so depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>If the monstrousness of these barbarous and inhuman cruelties committed on this Reverend Divine, his Wife and Daughter, and reported in this Relation, shall weaken the credit of the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and render the truth of it suspected, let the World know, that here is nothing set down in this account given unto the World, but what was testified upon Oath before the Right Honourable Sir <hi>Robert Heath</hi> Knight, Lord Chief Justice of His Majesties Court of Kings Bench, on the 18. day of <hi>August</hi> 1643.</p>
                  <p>On the 21 of <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1643. being Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> the Apostle and Evangelists day, a hundred and fifty Soldiers, some from <hi>Gloucester</hi> sent from Captain <hi>Beard</hi> being of his Company, and some others from <hi>Teuxbury,</hi> (all conspiring together, and taking advantage of the Peoples absence from their homes, and being at a Fair that day at <hi>Led<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> two miles distant from <hi>Malverne Hills</hi>) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of Captain <hi>Scriven,</hi> son to <hi>Scriven</hi> the rich Ironmonger, and late Mayor of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> came to <hi>Castle-Morton</hi> in the County of <hi>Worcester,</hi> to Plunder Mr. <hi>Rowland Bartlets</hi> house: a man so well beloved in his Country, for his Hospitality, so dear to all sorts of People, especially to the poor, for his Charity, and those helps which he freely bestowed on them, for the recovery of the sick, the lame, and infirm, that had not these Rebels taken the opportunity of his Neighbours being at
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:103099:100"/>
the Fair, this force had been too weak, to have made him the first instance of the Rebels inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency (in that County) by way of Plunder: when they came to <hi>Castle-Morton,</hi> for fear of sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizal, their Horse secure the streets, and High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, while the Pikes and Musqueteers beset the house: having made good all passages, that none could go in, or come out, without their leave, <hi>Scriven</hi> advanced towards the house: Mr. <hi>Bartlet</hi> perceiving himself to be enclosed with armed men, their Musquets being bent upon his house, and his Pales serving them instead of Rests; coming out of his doors, met <hi>Scriven</hi> in the Porch, and after a friendly salute, demanded of him the reason of this Warlike approach to his house? <hi>Scriven</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that he came in the name of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by their command to search for Arms: Alas! replied Mr. <hi>Bartlet,</hi> you are like to lose your labour, for Justice <hi>Salloway</hi> (meaning that traiterous beggerly Fellow, who in the time of the late universal madness, was made Knight of the Shire for the County of <hi>Worcester</hi>) hath prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you: yet Mr. <hi>Bartlet</hi> bad him use his discretion, to see if he could find any gleaning, after the others full Vintage: and so brought him through his Hall into his Parlour; being there Mr. <hi>Bartlet</hi> according to the freeness of his disposition, and after the good old English way of bidding wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, called for some Beer. While <hi>Scriven</hi> sate there, and with a curious eye surveyed the furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Room, he espied Mr. <hi>Bartlet</hi>'s Sword, hanging on the Wainscot, <hi>Scriven</hi> presently taking it down, said, is not this Arms? Yes, replied Mr. <hi>Bartlet,</hi> but no more than is necessary for every honest man, to prevent or repel injury on the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:103099:101"/>
High-way; young Mr. <hi>Bartlet</hi>'s Sword hanging by his Fathers, <hi>Scriven</hi> takes down that too: and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to disarm them, that so they might rob them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out resistance, the Rebels in the outward Rooms possess themselves of Mr. <hi>Bartlets</hi> mans Sword: young Mr. <hi>Bartlet</hi> coming into the Parlour, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to recover his Sword, <hi>Scriven</hi> perceiving a Ring (in which was set a Rubey) hanging in his band<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strings, rudely seized upon it, and after some strugling, some seconds with Pistols, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, coming to his assistance, <hi>Scriven</hi> either broke, or cut it off: having rob'd the young man of his Ring, animated by the presence of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Thieves, he dives into his Fathers Pockets, and takes thence his monies, between three and four pounds: Mr. <hi>Bartlet</hi> perceiving his hand in the return, to be full of mony, put his own hand into his pocket, to see what was left, and finding but one poor three pence, to have escap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his thievish fingers, tendered him that too, desiring him that all might go together, which was no sooner offered, than taken by this poor conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned unworthy Fellow, yet Heir to a Thousand pounds a year, unless the Hangman cut off the entail; Mr. <hi>Bartlet</hi> being clad in a fair scarlet Gip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po (a shrewd temptation to a man not accustomed to wear good Cloaths, especially at his own charge) so dazled <hi>Scrivens</hi> eyes, that he offered to pull it from the others back: Mr. <hi>Bartlet</hi> entreated him not to strip him of his Cloaths since he had taken away his monies, with which he should buy more: O Sir, replied this doughty Captain, you have mony enough to buy more, and so the hopes of a greater prize making him forget the Gippo, he drew his Sword, and threatned to kill Mr. <hi>Bart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:103099:101"/>
unless he would confess where he had hid his mony and Plate: but finding him resolute not to betray his own Treasure, <hi>Scriven</hi> seizeth upon a Woman that was Mr. <hi>Bartlets</hi> House-keeper, an old faithful Servant, in whom Mr. <hi>Bartlet</hi> and his Wife reposed much trust, and thinking to work upon the weakness of her Sex, and affright her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a confession, he causes some to present Pistols at her brest, and others the points of their Swords, threatening her with present death, if she would not discover where her Masters Treasure was: but finding this Woman not to be terrified with their threats, and fearing surprizal by some Forces which might come from <hi>Worcester,</hi> or the return of the Country people from the Fair at <hi>Ledbury,</hi> he resolved to make trial if he could find out that which he saw would not be disclosed unto him: Therefore without further delay to work they go, resolving to search the house from the top to the bottom. In Mr. <hi>Bartlets</hi> Chamber, <hi>Scriven</hi> seizeth upon Mrs. <hi>Bartlets</hi> Watch, he breaks open a Trunk, and took thence (by his own confession) six hundred Pounds in mony, he takes away all Mrs. <hi>Bartlets</hi> wearing Linnen, to the value of three-score Pounds, he breaks open her Cabinets, Trunks and Boxes, and in them seized or (to speak more properly) stole more Mony, Plate, Jewels and Bracelets, amounting to a great Sum: amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things valuable both for rarity and use, he took a Cock Eagles Stone, for which Thirty Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had been offered by a Physitian, but were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused: having thus scim'd the house, and rifled it of the principal things in it, a warning-piece is shot off, to signifie to the Rascality, that now they might have free leave to enter: upon the signal
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:103099:102"/>
given, leaving (instant) their guards, and stations, in a confused Tumult they rush into the house, and as eager hounds at a loss offer here and there, and know not well where to fasten, so, these hunt from the Parlour to the Kitchin, from thence, by the Chambers, to the Garrets: every Room is full, every one fearing that his fellow Thief would prevent him, and seize upon the prey before him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: Besides Mr. <hi>Bartlets,</hi> his Wives, and Childrens wearing apparel, they rob their servants of their Cloaths: with the butt ends of their Musquets they break open their hanging Presses, Cupboards, and Chests; no place was free from this ragged Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment: and if so barbarous an outrage, could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly have admitted any time, but for a serious detestation of so foul injustice, it may have drawn a smile from the most concerned beholders, to see their thrusting and tumbling one another, the rude arts used to supplant one another, and how one Thief snatched and stole from another: After this storm was seen coming on, and to threaten this house in particular, the Servants fearing that tho the main brunt might light on their Master, yet some sprinkling might chance to fall on them, used all the art of cunning they could devise, to preserve those small sums of mony, of which their honest labour and frugality had made them Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. But 'twas in vain to hide, where desperate beggery, and resolved Rapine were to be seekers: in one place the Rebels find Twenty Shillings, in another Forty, three Pounds here, more or less there: but were it more or less, all was fish that came to Net, they spare none: in this strict search, they meet with Mr. <hi>Bartlets</hi> Sweet-meats, these they scatter on the ground, not daring to tast of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:103099:102"/>
them for fear of Poison; a wary consideration, and such as staved not off the hardy Knight Sir <hi>William Brooke</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> to meet fists with a greazy Common Soldier in a Gally-pot, when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels of that County did the like out-rage on the truly honoured Lady <hi>Butlers</hi> Closet, as you heard in the first weeks Relation of this Mercury: and as for Syrupes, and Salves those charitable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions for the sick, and maimed, these they tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under foot, not providently foreseing that some of their Brethren in this Rebellion, might stand in need of them, the <hi>Friday</hi> next following at the Battel of <hi>Wickfield</hi> near <hi>Worcester,</hi> where God by the hand of the Kings Forces under the conduct of Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> gave the Rebels their first overthrow. The happy Omen of <hi>Edge-Hill,</hi> and those many other succeeding Victories with which (no less to the wonder than confusion of the Rebels) it hath pleased God since to bless his Sacred Majesty: In a word, except Bedding, Pew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Lumber, they left nothing behind them, for besides two Horses laden with the best things (<hi>Scrivens</hi> own Plunder) there being one hundred and fifty Rebels, each Rebel returned with a Pack at his back. As for his Beer, and Perry, what they could not devour they spoil, the earth drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what the Rebels could not, and then triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their wickedness, and glorying in their Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany, they vaunted, <hi>That they had made</hi> Bartlet <hi>a Begger, and left him not worth a Groat:</hi> Yet all the Rebels were not of the same belief, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after, when the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> possessed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of <hi>Worcester,</hi> some under his Command came from <hi>Worcester</hi> to Mr. <hi>Bartlets</hi> house, where what was undervalued and left by <hi>Scriven,</hi> and his Rout,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103099:103"/>
was good booty to these: They take away good store of Bacon from his Roof, and Beef out of the Powdering Tubs; they steal his Pots, Panns, and Kettels, together with his Pewter to a great value, they seize on all his Provisions for hospitality and house-keeping, and then break his Spits, as unnecessary utensils, they expose his bedding to sale, and press Carts to carry away his Chairs, Stools, Couches, and Trunks, though emptied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by <hi>Scriven</hi>; and sharply threaten all such as should be known to harbour any of Mr. <hi>Bartlets</hi> Goods. And though these two Plunders, one upon the neck of the other, left Mr. <hi>Bartlet</hi> a desolate, naked house; yet when the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> came lately down towards <hi>Glocester,</hi> and hid himself and his Army in hedges, ditches, and the inclosures about <hi>Teuxbury,</hi> on three several days, three sever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Companies came to visit Mr. <hi>Bartlets</hi> house, presuming that in almost a Twelve months time, the house might be new furnished, nor were they altogether deceived in their expectation; without, they plunder him of eight Horses, and within, what ever they found, they made clean work, the fifth Plunder not sparing his Kitchin-stuff, which being reserved in a small Barrel, a Soldier put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it on his shoulder, carried it away; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this last time to Mr. <hi>Bartlets</hi> house, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that he, and his Sons were in the Kings Army, they abused his Wife in beastly, immodest scurrilous language, which I shall omit to relate, as offensive to Christian ears: I shall conclude this five-fold Plunder, with the relation of one of their Captains Hipocrisie, and a Common Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers impiety, glorying in his wickedness: The Captain being invited to eat of a Stubble-Goose,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:103099:103"/>
which a Soldier had Plundered and brought into his Quarters, refused to taste of it, and gave this reason for his refusal, because it was stoln, which bred in Mrs. <hi>Bartlet</hi> a great opinion that he was a conscientious man, but being to march away, he that would eat no stoln Goose, made no scruple to ride away upon a stoln Mare, for plundering Mrs. <hi>Bartlet</hi> of her own Mare, this Hypocritical Captain (and pity it is I cannot tell you his name) gave sufficient Testimony to the World, that the old Pharisee and the new Puritan, have Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the self-same temper, <hi>To strain at a Gnat, and swallow a Camel,</hi> measuring all Actions, not by lawful, and unlawful, but as they are more, or less gainful. But while the Captain chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be a Villain, than openly to appear so, the Common Soldiers would not only be so indeed, but desire so to be accounted; and therefore when his Companions were carrying out Mr. <hi>Bartlet</hi>'s Goods, amongst other things, one seized on some live Partridges, and being entreated to forbear, and to spare them, because they were provided for a Great-bellied Gentlewoman, and now ready to lay down her burthen, the Common Soldiers hearing him plead thus, barbarously replied, if we had made Venison of her great Belly, she would not have longed for Partridges, for I have killed young and old, Men, Women, and Children: and boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself in his sin, and glorying in his shame, without regard had to the dangerous longing of a pregnant Woman, if not satisfied, took them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. So truly is that of the Prophet verified in these Miscreants, <hi>They declare their Sin as</hi> Sodom, <hi>they hide it not, Woe unto their Soul, for they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded evil to themselves,</hi> Esay 3.9.</p>

                        <hi>The Rebels persecution of Dr.</hi> Featly, <hi>a known Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of the Protestant Religion: part of his Sermon against the Secretaries: his death: Together with their murthering of two of the Inhabitants of</hi> Lambeth <hi>on the Lords-day,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IN <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1642. some of the Rebels Foot Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers being Billetted at <hi>Acton</hi> in the County of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> they presently enquire of their Hosts what their Doctor was, (meaning Doctor <hi>Featly,</hi> their then Rector) and what Divine Service they had; they answered according to the truth, that he was a man who precisely observed the Canons of the Church, and swerved not a title from the Rubrick of the Common Prayer, wearing the Surplice, and using all the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church established by Law. Some of the Red-coats replyed, Doth he so? We will teach him another Lesson, and make him leave those Popish Superstitions, or he shall rue it. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they repair to the Church at <hi>Acton,</hi> break open the Doors by force, in the Chancel they find this Subscription on the Wall, <hi>This Chancel was repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and beautified, such a year, by</hi> Daniel Featly <hi>D.D. Rector,</hi> which they utterly defaced: Then laying hands on the Rails, they dealt with them (as Ducks do with a Frog) tear them limbless, and afterwards burnt them in the Street, saying, <hi>That if they had
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:103099:104"/>
the Parson there, they would burn him with his Popish Trinkets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Soon after, Colonel <hi>Urrey</hi> took up his Quarters at the Parsonage-house, some of whose Soldiers, (whether willingly or by carelesness, being in Drink, is not certified) lying in the Doctors Barn, set it on Fire, which burned the whole Barn full of Corn, and two Stables, down to the ground, the loss being estimated by the Inhabitants at Two hundred and eleven pounds.</p>
                  <p>But to leave <hi>Acton,</hi> and come to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> where the Secretaries wrecked their spleen, not upon Pales, or Rails, or the Fruits of the Earth, as at <hi>Acton,</hi> but upon the Bodies of Christs Servants, on his own Day, and in his own House and Court. For <hi>February</hi> 19. 1642. even in the midst of Divine Service, at the reading of the <hi>Te Deum laudamus,</hi> four or five Soldiers rushed into the Church with Pistols, and drawn Swords, affrighted the whole Congregation out, wounded one of the Inhabitants (whereof he soon after died) shot another dead, as he hung by the hands on the Church-yard wall, looking over to the Palace Court, who might truly have said in the words of the Poet, though in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other sense, <hi>Ut vidi, ut perii.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was gathered by many Circumstances, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by Depositions taken before the Coroner, and by some Speeches that fell from their own mouths, that their principal aim at that time, was to have murdered the Doctor, which 'tis probable they had effected, had not some honest Inhabitants premonished the Doctor, who was at the same time on his way towards the Church, intending to have Preached.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:103099:105"/>About the same time, many of these Murderers were heard expressing their rancour against the Doctor, thus: Some said they would chop the Rogue as small as Herbs to the Pot, for suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pottage, (for by that name they usually stile the Book of Common Prayer) to be read in his Church: Others said, They would squeeze the Pope out of his Belly, with such like scurrilous and malicious Language.</p>
                  <p>The Sunday sennight after this Outrage, being the fifth of <hi>March,</hi> the Doctor perceiving some Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratists at Sermon at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> took occasion to speak as followeth:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>IF ever Schismaticks and foul mouth'd Separatists were set forth in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive colours, the Schismaticks of this age are,</hi> Psal. 50.16, 17, 18, 19, 20. What hast thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that thou should'st take my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in thy mouth? Seeing thou hatest instruction <hi>(whatsoever thou pratest of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation)</hi> and castest my words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind thee, (<hi>namely, Prov.</hi> 14.21. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 10.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8, 9, 17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13.) When thou sawest a thief, then thou consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edst
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:103099:105"/>
with him, and hast been partaker with Adulterers. Thou givest thy mouth to lying, and thy Tongue fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth deceit. Thou sittest and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est against thy Brother, and slanderest thine own Mothers son. <hi>For is not this their canting Language?</hi> The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of <hi>England</hi> are all Antichristian; The Ministers <hi>Baals</hi> Priests; The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service, Idolatrous; The Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, Superstitious; and the Sacraments corrupted with mans Inventions. <hi>I take them at their word; If this be true, then is the Church of</hi> England <hi>no true Church of Christ; then they which have received all the Religion they have from her, are no better then Miscreants, Pagans, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, in apparent peril of drowning in everlasting perdition, because out of the Ark, without God in this World, because without his Church. For as the Blessed Martyr Saint</hi> Cyprian <hi>soundly argueth against their Fore-fathers the</hi> Catharists,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:103099:106"/>
Deum non potest habere Patrem, qui Ecclesiam not habet Matrem: <hi>And Church they have none for their Mother, for they disclaim the true Protestant Church of</hi> England, <hi>and the Popish dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims them; so they are mere</hi> A per se A's, Independents, <hi>like the</hi> horti pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les <hi>in</hi> Lactantius, <hi>and</hi> Mausolus <hi>his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre in</hi> Martial, <hi>hanging and hovering in the Air.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Scripture sets forth the true visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church of Christ upon Earth, under the Emblem of a great</hi> Field, <hi>a great</hi> Floor, <hi>a great</hi> House, <hi>a great</hi> Sheet, <hi>a great</hi> Draw-net, <hi>a great and large</hi> Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, &amp;c. <hi>The Church shadowed. out under these Similitudes, cannot be their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, or rather Conventicles: For as they brag and commend themselves, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good Neighbors; In their</hi> Field <hi>there are no</hi> Tares, <hi>in their</hi> Floor <hi>there is no</hi> Chaff, <hi>in their</hi> House <hi>no</hi> Vessels <hi>of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor,

They have not sate with vain Persons, nor kept company with Dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers; they have hated the assembly of Malignants, and have not accompanied with the Ungodly; they have not, nor will not Christen in the same Font, nor sit at the Holy Table, (for to kneel at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Idolatry) nor drink Spiritually the Blood of our Redeemer in the same Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice with the wicked. Get ye packing then out of our Churches with your bags and baggages, hoyse up Sail for</hi> New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>or the</hi> Isle of Providence, <hi>or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sir</hi> Thomas More's Eutopia, <hi>where</hi> Pluto's Commoner, <hi>and</hi> Osorius <hi>his</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman, <hi>and</hi> Castillio <hi>his</hi> Courtier, <hi>and</hi> Vigetius <hi>his</hi> Soldier, <hi>and</hi> Tully <hi>his</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, <hi>and</hi> Aristocles Felix, <hi>and the</hi> Jews Bencohab, <hi>and the Manichees</hi> Paraclet, <hi>and the Gnosticks</hi> Illuminate ones, <hi>and

                  <p>
                     <hi>There are three Heads of Catechism and Grounds of Christianity,</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Creed, the Lords Prayer, and the Ten Commandments; <hi>these may be more truly than</hi> Gorran <hi>his Postills, term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> aurea fundamenta, <hi>which they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to overthrow and cast down; and when they have done it, no place remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for them to build their Synagogues, or</hi> Maria Rotunda's, <hi>but the Sand in the Saw-pit, where their Apostle</hi> Browne <hi>first taught most profoundly. The Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they have excluded out of their Liturgy, the Apostles Creed out of their Confession, and the Ten Commandments, by the</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians <hi>their Disciples, out of their rule
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:103099:107"/>
of life. They are too good to say the Lords Prayer, better taught than to rehearse the Apostles Creed, better liv'd than to hear the Decalogue read at their Service, for God can see no Sin in them, nor Man Honesty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tell me, ye Bastard brood of</hi> Martius, <hi>is it not sufficient for the conviction of your cauterized Consciences, that ye wreck your spleen upon the material Temples of God, by breaking down Organs, burning Rails, and defacing the Monuments of the Dead, but will ye go about to destroy the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Temple of the Holy Ghost? not fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that dreadful Sentence of the Apostle,</hi> He that destroyeth the Temple of God, him shall God destroy. <hi>Could they not be content to tear the Book of Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in pieces, and scatter the leaves all about the Church, but will they also rend and dilacerate the living Members of Christs mystical Body? Will they charge the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:103099:108"/>
with murthering Shot to destroy and dissipate whole Assemblies of Gods Servants met together upon his own Day to Worship him in his own House? Do they think that their bare opposition to Popery will save them? If that alone would give a Man a good Title to Heaven, not only the</hi> Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Libertines, Familists, Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>and other damnable Hereticks, but even the</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Turks <hi>would snatch Heaven from them, and take it by force, for these are as vehement Opposers of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery as they are: And howsoever the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Opposition to Popish Superstition is all the Religion some of them have, yet are they not at so deadly fewd with Papists, as they would bear the World in hand, for they shake hands with them in many of their Tenets and Practices, both of them condemn our English Liturgy, and profess Recusancy: both of them Idolize their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Who hath bewitched them, that they should believe</hi> Bedlam <hi>shall be so far
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:103099:108"/>
enlarged, and the Spirit of Frenzy possess Old</hi> England, <hi>that they should have the like success here, as their cousin-germans the Anabaptists had at</hi> Munster? <hi>though we envy them not their</hi> high preferment <hi>in the end. After these fits of Convulsion are over, and Peace setled in the Body of the Kingdom, do they think the wisdom of the State will ever change our Holy Churches into their prophane Barns and Stables? our Pulpits into their Tubs? our linnen Ephods into their Aprons? our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy into their extemporary Enthusiasms? our Learned Pastors into their ignorant Hirelings? and our Apostolical Hierarchy into their Apostolical Anarchy? But I will restrain my self, and confine my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:103099:109"/>Soon after this Sermon, seven Articles were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred against the Doctor to the Committee for Plundered Ministers, by three Mechanicks, who had formerly been Indicted for <hi>Brownists,</hi> at the Sessions for the County of <hi>Surrey</hi>; but after long attendance, the Doctor was acquitted of them. Yet at length these Sectaries wrought so powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Doctor must be committed to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, how unjustly soever; 'twas enough that he was a Doctor, and maintained the Religion esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in the Church of <hi>England</hi>: And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, on the 30<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> 1643. he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Peter-house</hi>; his own House, Library and Goods being first seized on, and his Estate seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred. The Sunday after his commitment, and for divers other Lords-days, he Preached to his Fellow-Prisoners, but after a while he was prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by <hi>Isaac-Pennington</hi> the pretended Mayor of <hi>London.</hi> And though Sir <hi>George Sands,</hi> Sir <hi>John Butler,</hi> Master <hi>Nevile,</hi> and other Prisoners of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Petitioned that he might continue his so doing, yet it would not be granted.</p>
                  <p>See how this unjust Imprisonment is relished by a Forein Divine, in these very words:</p>

                  <p>After the Doctor had been many Months stifled up in Prison, and having a Certificate from his Physitian that he could not live long, if he had not some fresh Air, he Petitioned these Soul-enthralling Tyrants, and at last obtained leave to go to <hi>Chelsey-Colledge</hi> for six Weeks, upon good Bail, to recover his Health: but it pleased God to take him out of this World, upon the 17. day of <hi>April,</hi> 1645. being the very last day of the six Weeks limited for his return.</p>
                  <p>During his Sickness, he gave himself wholly to Divine Meditations, often bewailing with Tears, the present state of the Church of <hi>England</hi>: he made a Confession of his Faith to Doctor <hi>Leo,</hi> and the Dutch Ambassadors Chaplain, saying, <hi>That the Doctrine which he had always Preached, and the Books which he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Printed against Anabaptists and other Sectaries, were agreeable to Gods Word; and that he would Seal the Protestant Religion (as it was established and confirmed by the Acts of three Pious Princes) with his Blood.</hi> And being asked by some that came to visit him, What he thought of the Covenant? he said,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:103099:110"/>
                     <hi>It was a damnable and execrable Oath, made purposely to insnare poor Souls, and full of Malice and Treason against our Gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign.</hi> And, said he, <hi>For Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment (a thing now much controverted) I dare boldly affirm, That the Hierarchy of Bishops is most agreeable to the Word of God, as being of Apostolical Institution, the taking away whereof is damnable; and that by consequence, both the Presbyterian and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Governments are absurd and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, neither of them being ever heard of in the Church of God, till of late at</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva; <hi>nor is there so much as any colour for them in Holy Writ. It is evident</hi> (said he) <hi>that as the Priests in the Old Testament were above the Levites, so in the New the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were above the Disciples, and that the seven Angels of the seven Churches in the</hi> Apocalypse <hi>were seven Bishops, and that</hi> Polycarpus <hi>was Bishop of</hi> Smyrna, <hi>and</hi> Timotheus <hi>of</hi> Ephesus. <hi>And for the Laity, no pregnant proof can be produced, That they ever medled with the Priests Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:103099:110"/>
or had any Power to ordain Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. And these things</hi> (said he) <hi>I intended to have published to the World, if God had spared me longer life, which I might (through his goodness), have enjoyed, had I not been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly Imprisoned</hi>: which he several times reiterated to his Friends.</p>
                  <p>Anon after he Prayed thus: <hi>Lord, strike through the reins of them that rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Church and King, and let them be as chaff before the Wind, and as stubble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fire; let them be scattered as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges upon the Mountains, and let the breath of the Lord consume them; but upon our Gracious Soveraign and his Posterity, let the Crown flourish: This</hi> (said he) <hi>is the hearty and earnest Prayer of a poor sick Creature.</hi> With which, and other such spiritual Eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, he expired.</p>

                  <p>THE Author of the French History re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating that horrid <hi>Rebellion</hi> of the <hi>Holy League</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type</hi> of the present <hi>Rebellion</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> gives this definition or Character of one of those <hi>Zealots: Essential form</hi> (saies he) <hi>of a Zealous Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in the Holy League, was to Rob and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Churches, to Ravish Wives, and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to murther Men against the Altars, to spoyl the Clergy, not to be the Kings Servants, which that Age held for a Crime, but to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit out against him, all the indignities, and all the wickednesses which Irreligion, and Injustice could invent in mad Soldiers:</hi> do change <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Catholick</hi> into <hi>Zealous Puritan,</hi> and no Pencil ever limm'd a <hi>Rebell</hi> of this present <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> so exactly to the life as this: and though they have out-done all examples, presidents of wickedness, cruelty, disloyalty, sacrilege, and prophanation, as if in them the Devil meant to shew his Master-piece, raging in them horribly, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he knows that he hath but a short time,</hi> yet to their dishonouring of God, their vilifying his holy worship, prophaning his Temples, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming the footsteps of his Anointed, affronting
<pb facs="tcp:103099:113"/>
and contemning his Priests and Ministers, to their rending, rearing, and trampling underfoot, all Hallowed Ornaments, and Vtensils provided for the reverend, and decent worship of God, I know nothing that they have left undone, which remaines yet to be added to their accursed impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. So that what the old <hi>Eustathians, Meslali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Fratricelli,</hi> and the rest of those wild He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks (who placed their Religion in <hi>Contempt</hi> of Consecrated Churches, Temples, and Oratories, places Consecrated, and set apart for the publick worship of God) durst not do, these Schismatical <hi>Rebels,</hi> (having wilfully smothered not only their Consciences, but the dictate of common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) putting no difference <hi>between Holy, and Prophane,</hi> have acted with greediness: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever things they are, whereon the <hi>name of God</hi> is <hi>called,</hi> whether <hi>Persons, times</hi> or <hi>places,</hi> in the Judgment of venerable Antiquity, whether <hi>Councils, Fathers,</hi> or <hi>Historians,</hi> those things were ever held Sacred and Inviolable, always <hi>habenda cum Discrimine</hi> and that <hi>extra Usum Sacrum,</hi> to be regarded with a reverential, and <hi>discriminative usance,</hi> that is, with a select and different respect from other things of the same kind, but not imployed to Holy uses: nay the honouring <hi>Gods House,</hi> was ever held an Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient of that Petition of the Lords Prayer, <hi>Sanctificetur Nomen tuum, Hallowed be thy Name:</hi> what opinion the <hi>Ancient Fathers,</hi> both
<pb facs="tcp:103099:113"/>
                     <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> had of such places, may be collected from those Magnificent, and honourable Names, whereby they commended them to the due esteem of several Ages in which they lived: Some in regard of their <hi>use</hi> and <hi>imployment</hi> called them the <hi>Lords House,</hi> some <hi>the Patrimony of Christ,</hi> some the <hi>Dowry of the Spouse of Christ,</hi> some a <hi>Consecrated Possession of God,</hi> and a <hi>Holy Soil:</hi> others in respect of their <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence</hi> of <hi>Structure,</hi> and <hi>Costliness of</hi> Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, called them <hi>Palaces, Royal</hi> or <hi>Kingly Houses:</hi> Nay would we but <hi>sharpen our Goads at a Philistines Forge,</hi> or <hi>weave the Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Yarn of the Gentiles, with Linnen webb of the Christians,</hi> I mean, call in the Testimony and practice of the Heathen, in what vener ation and esteem they had their Idol Temples (which was in them the dictate of Nature, mistaken only in the Object) and they would stand up, as so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny witnesses, and certainly in the day of Judgment, shall condemn-this prophane Generation, who under an Hypocritical pretence of worshiping God <hi>in Spirit,</hi> in a true <hi>Anabaptistical</hi> fury, have laid wast the Sanctuaries of God, polluted his Temples, and <hi>broken down all their carved work with Axes and Hammers:</hi> And though these Rebellious Schismaticks have in all places (which have been plagued with their presence) <hi>Roared in the midst of our Congregations, set up their Banners for tokens,</hi> and left some infamous memorial of their frenzie, and hatred
<pb facs="tcp:103099:114"/>
of the beauty and magnificence of Gods Houses; and therefore in every place made it their first business (as an introduction to the rest) to rob, and deface Churches, and violate the Sepulchres and Monuments of the dead, so they have exprest their greatest hatred against the <hi>Mother Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> and <hi>Cathedrals</hi> of this Kingdom, because in them, the primitive Order, and decency, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the <hi>Rubrick</hi> of the Book of <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> and ratified by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> have been best preserved from those <hi>Omissions, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects,</hi> and <hi>Contempts,</hi> which had almost ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished them out of private <hi>Parochial Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and rendered them obnoxious to sinister in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations, and suspected of no less than <hi>Popery, Superstition,</hi> and <hi>Innovation,</hi> in those places wherein they were retained, and practised: when therefore our Posterity shall see this <hi>Abomination of desolation,</hi> which the Rebels have <hi>brought into</hi> these Temples of God, and by Tradition hear of those costly Vtensils, and Ornaments, which most Sacrilegiously they have <hi>carried out,</hi> and shall with wonder, and astonishment inquire, what Lunacy? what Frenzy? what accursed madness possessed the hearts of the men of this present Age, to lay wast the places where Gods honour dwells? where God vouchsafes to meet with his People, and the People, with united de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, to propitiate their God, and impiously (as much as in them is) to turne these <hi>Beauties
<pb facs="tcp:103099:114"/>
of Holiness</hi> into desolate places, <hi>for Ziim, and Ochim,</hi> (as the Prophet speaks) <hi>and the Satyrs to dance in, Esay 13.12.</hi> Let them know, that the <hi>Puritans, Brownists,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> Rebels, marching under the Banners of a faction in the two <hi>pretended Houses of Parliament</hi> (which yet some have the impudence to call the Great and Highest Court, the Supreame Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the most zealous Protectors, and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertors of the Established Protestant Religion) have brought this desolation upon us. And because this Tempest raged first the <hi>East,</hi> and so spread it self into all parts of the Kingdom, <hi>West, North,</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> I shall in the Relation keep the same Method (if so great confusion can be ranged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a method) whereby we shall give (as is due) Precedency to the famous <hi>Metropolitan Church of Canterbury,</hi> which as it is (in respect of her lesser Sisters) first in <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Dignity,</hi> so was it then and now shall be, the first instance of the Rebels Sacrilege.</p>

Christ-Church,

&amp; bujus pertinacissimus aemulus</hi> (as learned <hi>Cambden</hi> speaks) the eager rival of <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> St. <hi>Augustines.</hi> This Church by the injury of <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> and <hi>time,</hi> (two greedy devourers) lies almost buried in its own Ruines, presenting nothing else to the eye of the beholders, but a sad spectacle, how spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and ample a structure it once was, when now, a piece of it hath the honour to be stiled (though seldom imploy'd as) the <hi>Kings House.</hi> But <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> placed as it were in the Navel of the City, raiseth it self to so great a Majesty, and Stateliness, that <hi>Erasmus,</hi> a man not too much taken with mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence in this kind, I am sure not doting on it, saies, that this doth present it selfe with so Majestick state, <hi>ut procul etiam Intuentibus religionem incutiat,</hi> that it occasions that devotion, which should be used there, and strikes a sensible impression of Religion, in their hearts that behold it, though a far off, and at a distance. This Church built in old time (as <hi>Beda</hi> saies) by the faithful and believing <hi>Romans,</hi> and by King <hi>Ethelbert</hi> given to <hi>Augustine,</hi> in process of time needed the like Piety to support it, as at first built it, and works of that Nature in those days, did not long lye neglected, for want of benefactors: <hi>Lanfranke</hi> therefore, the thirty third Arch-Bishop of this <hi>Sea</hi> (whether more famous for repairing of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caied Churches, as this of <hi>Canterbury, Rochester,</hi> and S. <hi>Albans,</hi> or his indefatigable pains in correcting the corrupt translations of the <hi>Holy Bible,</hi> scattered every where through the Kingdom in his days, is uncertain.) <hi>William Corbet,</hi> or (as others will have it) <hi>Corbois,</hi> the thirty sixth Arch-Bishop of the same <hi>Sea,</hi> reedified the Quire, and the upper part of this Church, and the Piety of succeeding Bishops built and joyned the Nave or body to the Quire, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103099:116"/>
brought, it to this Magnificence, and splendor in whih we now see it. But what our Fore-fathers thought <hi>Religion to build up,</hi> we, their degenerous posterity, think <hi>Piety</hi> to <hi>pull down,</hi> so that while some leading Atheists (enemies to God and his Religion, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate to every good work</hi>) are busy to Vote and cry down <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> with the <hi>Sacred Hierarchy, Root</hi> and <hi>Branch</hi>: their <hi>Emissaries</hi> incouraged and set on by them, first <hi>deface</hi> these Churches, and in the next place, will utterly <hi>ruin</hi> them, that so, the places where God is worshiped, being demolished, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue that maintains the worship, may become a prey to these Sacrilegious Cormorants: <hi>But my God shall make them like a wheel.</hi> Now, how the Rebels behaved themselves in their first attempt, in this kind, on the Cathedral Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of Colonel <hi>Sandys,</hi> I cannot better express than in the passionate elegancy of Reverend Doctor <hi>Paske,</hi> one of the <hi>Prebends,</hi> and at that time <hi>Subdean</hi> of that Church, to the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> the most ingrateful, and most unthankful of men.</p>

Christ, and swore that he would rip up his Bowels: which they did accordingly, so far as the figures were capable thereof, besides many other Villanies: and not content therewith, finding another statue of Christ in the Frontispiece of the South-gate, they discharged against it forty shot at the least, triumphing much, when they did hit it in the head, or face, as if they were resolved to crucifie him again in his figure, whom they could not hurt in truth: nor had their fury been thus stopped, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ruine of the whole Fabrick, had not the Colonel, with some others, come to the relief and rescue: the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults appeased, they presently departed for <hi>Dover,</hi> from whence we expect them this day; and are much afraid, that as they have already vilified our Persons, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered extream indignity to one of our Brethren, so they will Plunder our Houses at their Return, unless the care of the Major, the Colonel, and some Members of the House of Commons (Sir <hi>Edward Masters,</hi> and Captain <hi>Nut,</hi> now with us, who have promised to present their knowledg to that honourable House) do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the same.</p>

But before we pass from the relation of this horried Sacrilege, committed on the Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> I could not free my self from being guilty of that great sin of obscuring the great mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of <hi>Gods Justice,</hi> if I should in silence pass over that most examplary vengeance, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued to death, that unfortunate Gentleman Col. <hi>Sandys,</hi> the ringleader to that Rebellious rout, which were Actors in that more than Barbarous outrage.</p>
                  <p>Whether the cunning perswasions of others, or his own ambitiom first imbarked him in this fatal undertaking, is uncertain, but as himself confessed on his death-bed, to a friend and Kinsman of his, who asked him, what he meant being a Gentleman of so fair an Estate, to ingage himself in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:103099:118"/>
he answered, <hi>That he was so far drawn in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was aware, that he knew not how to come off, without the danger of his head:</hi> So usual it is for one sin to ingage the sinner for a second: having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore once lifted up his hand against his Sovereign, <hi>the Lords Anoynted,</hi> he thought the way to be secure from the punishment of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> was to presevere in his crime, and go on in <hi>Rebellion</hi>: in pursuance therefore of so black designs, being Colonel of a Regiment of Horse, in <hi>Sept.</hi> 1642. with the rest of the Rebels Army under the Conduct of the <hi>Earl of Essex,</hi> he advanced towards <hi>Worcester,</hi> and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some excursions with ten Troops of Horse from the body of their Army, at <hi>Wickefeild,</hi> near <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> accidentally were met by <hi>Prince Rupert,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by <hi>Prince Maurice,</hi> and some others, <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of His Majesties <hi>Cavallry</hi>: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus by chance met, The Prince glad of any opportunity, to express the braveness of his resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, charged the Rebels with incomparable valour: In this short, but fierce conflict, Colonel <hi>Sandys</hi> was wounded, and being dismounted his Horse, became Prisoner to the Kings party. Being thus wounded and as then was conceived, mortally, he began to reflect upon himself, and finding so little warrant in his now unbiass'd conscience for his undertaking, which had brought him into this condition, his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed Soul brake out into many sad expressions of remorse: crying out, <hi>Woe, Woe, to evil Counsel, and happy are they that do not take it.</hi> And being put in mind by a Reverend Doctor in Divinity, and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain to Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> of the heinousness of the sin of Rebellion, he acknowledged himself to have faln into that sin, and that God was just in his Judgments for finding him out in <hi>his iniquity,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103099:118"/>
withal his hearty sorrow, and repentance for it: whereupon the Doctor replyed, that if he recovered, perhaps the same perswasions from others, or inconsiderateness in himself, might again ingage him in his Rebellion, at which words a little lifting up his hand, he professed, <hi>He would rather have it cut off, then ever again lift it up against the King:</hi> He freely acknowledged the Justice of the Kings cause, and that he had observe the blessings of God to accompany it, and when the Doctor desired leave to testify his Repentance to the world, he freely gave him leave, asking God and the King forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, praying for a blessing upon him, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. In this mind he continued while Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and the Kings forces with him staid in <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi>: and whether after the <hi>Earls</hi> possessing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of <hi>Worcester,</hi> by the impetuous sollicitations of those Murtherers of Souls, those Factors for Hell, their Schismatical Lecturers, (who make men <hi>twofold more the Children of the Devil than themselves</hi>) he fell off, and turned <hi>Apostate</hi> from his newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved <hi>Loyalty,</hi> as repenting of his Repentance, is uncertain; Those that were about him and saw his weakness, ever declining from the first hour he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his wounds, must testify to the World that he had neither strength of hand to write, nor so much composedness of spirit, to be the Author of that Spurious, Supposititious <hi>Vindication,</hi> Published in his name <hi>Oct.</hi> 11. 1642. He being (whatsoever that forgery pretends) as unable to vindicate himself with his Pen, as his sword: but if he had his <hi>heart,</hi> as well as <hi>hand</hi> subscribing to that Atheistical resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where they thus bring him in foaming out his own shame, <hi>The Apprehension of death never hitherto so nearly touched me, but if God shall once restore me to

my former strength, I shall by his help, with as much alacrity and I hope courage, endeavour, to defend, and maintain with my dearest blood, this so good a cause</hi> (meaning this present Rebellion) <hi>as ever I was at first engaged in it.</hi> If I say they had his <hi>heart,</hi> as well as his <hi>hand</hi> to that Resolution, I am afraid it was too evident a Symptom of a wretched man, given up to a <hi>Reprobate sense,</hi> which of all spiritual judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments questionless is the greatest; and might justly call for those <hi>Torments of body,</hi> which afterward, as a Gangreen devoured and eat up his flesh, and those <hi>pangs of Conscience,</hi> which I am afraid were but the earnest of a worse condition to insue: for as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saies, <hi>As for such as turn back unto their own wickedness, the Lord shall lead them forth, with the workers of iniquity, Psal.</hi> 125.5. but I Remember that of S. <hi>Paul, Judg nothing before the time, until the Lord come:</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. And therefore while on Supposition I writ my fears, positively I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine nothing, not knowing, whether God might not give him the grace of Repentance at the last, which if he did, he only (I dare say) that gave the <hi>Grace,</hi> knew of it: concerning his eternal conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therefore, I shall leave him to the Judgment of that Righteous God, that judgeth Righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>gives to every man according to his works</hi>: and only inform the World in what condition the Colonel lay, until the time of his dissolution, and putting off his earthly, but loathsom Tabernacle.</p>
                  <p>As the Col. was amongst the Rebels a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable man, both for his extraction, and quality, and likewise for his Estate (to say nothing of his valour, and resolution, had they been Loyally imployed) so it was among their chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est cares to recover him of those wounds which he received in their unchristan quarrel: while therefore
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103099:119"/>
the Rebels Army lay in <hi>Worcester</hi> (which was about three weeks) though then upon more strict search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his wounds, in the opinion of the best Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions, they were not mortal, yet, whatsoever the Art, and invention either of the Physician or Chir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urgion, could contribute to his recovery, was not omitted: when the Rebels Army drew out, to meet the King, in their March from <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> which they did to their cost at <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel was committed to the care of his own Chirurgion, then in pay under him, <hi>John Anthony</hi> of <hi>London</hi>: to whom, as a witness and an assistant in the crue, was joyned a Chirurgion of the City of <hi>Worcester, Edward Marshall</hi>: who, though they both used all the Art, and Industry that possibly they could, to effect the cure, yet the difficulties every day multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied against the means, and in despight of their Balsoms, his wounds did putrify and the flesh rot, to the wonder of the <hi>Artists,</hi> and the <hi>Scorn</hi> of their <hi>Art</hi>: In so much that the Chirurgions, after much variety of means used, and much strugling with these growing evils (the cure still going backward, as if their skill had been imploy'd to widen those wounds which they pretended to close up) were heard by many of the City of <hi>Worcester</hi> to confess, what <hi>Hippocrates</hi> saies every Physician should first look after, in every cure, that there was, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the hand of God in it,</hi> that it was a <hi>peculiar judgment</hi> upon him, and that the cause of this putrefaction was <hi>more than Natural</hi>: nor were they without good grounds for this conjecture, for besides the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of their own Art, directly thwarted, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the several parts of the body of their Patient, was a clear demonstration: Those wounds in the upper parts of his body, near the Vitals, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:103099:120"/>
more dangerous, were cured long before his death, but those in his thigh, which were flesh wounds, as they call them, these were the <hi>Oppropria Chyrurgorum,</hi> here the flesh did daily rot, and putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and was cut away by degrees, even to the leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the bones naked, and stunk in so loathsom a manner, that as he was a burthen to himself, so to his friends too, and those that were about him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hardly able, for the noysomness of the smell, either to come near him to do the office of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary attendance, or so much as to endure the room where he lay, so intolerable was the stench, and so offensive.</p>
                  <p>Nor were the wounds of his <hi>Body</hi> more insuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his friends, than the wounds of his <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to himself, the guilt of Rebellion wrought in him strong convulsions of Soul, high distempers of mind, yet that he might not sink under the burden of his <hi>wounded Spirit,</hi> a weight that requires more than man to support it, he sent for Master <hi>Cotterell,</hi> an Orthodox godly Minister, and Parson of <hi>S. Andrews</hi> in <hi>Worcester,</hi> to <hi>Administer a word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> unto him in this his afflicted condition.</p>
                  <p>When Master <hi>Cotterell</hi> came unto him, he found <hi>Obadiah Sedgwick</hi> that scandalous seditious Minister of <hi>Essex,</hi> in private conference with the Colonel: and Bread and Wine, ready prepared for the <hi>Lords Supper: Sedgwick</hi> having ended his discourse, went to Prayers, whereupon Master <hi>Cotterell</hi> offering to withdraw, he was intreated by one of the Colonels Servants to stay, which accordingly he did: <hi>Sedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> having concluded his extemporary Prayer, took his leave and departed, refusing to stay either to administer the Sacrament to the Colonel, or to Communicate with him: of which refusal, when
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:103099:120"/>
Master <hi>Cotterell</hi> afterward desired to know the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, all the satisfaction that was given him, was, that <hi>Sedgwick</hi> was not fully assured of the fitness, and due preparation of those that were to receive the Sacrament with him. Desperate Hypocrisie,! whatsoever he was perswaded of the preparation of the other Communicants, 'tis most certain, he could not be ignorant of the unfitness of the Colonel himself: whom he himself in all probability per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to return <hi>with the dog to his vomit,</hi> and to justify himself in <hi>that sin</hi> of which but very lately he seemed to repent: 'tis more probable, that, that poor remainder of Conscience in <hi>Sedgwick,</hi> not quite yet <hi>put away,</hi> though it suffered him to betray, in private, a dying man to impenitency, under feigned pretences of what he in his own Soul must needs confess to be a crying sin, and inrolled by S. <hi>Paul</hi> himself amongst those <hi>works of the flesh</hi> which do exclude from the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> yet his heart might smite him, and his conscience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand him as it were to the face, that he durst not seal <hi>that destructive Counsel,</hi> by delivery of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: <hi>Sedgwick</hi> being gone, the Colonel will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly entertained conference with Master <hi>Cotterell</hi>; to whom he made a general confession of his sins, and the grievousness of them, professing his hearty repentance, and sorrow for them. But as the two pretended Houses of Parliament, in their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of sins, reckoned up in their Homily (if without offence I may so call it) and offered to this Nation as the subject matter of their <hi>solemn humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> quite forgot <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> for some reasons best known to themselves: so this Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theirs in his general Confession, made no mention of the sin of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> which most nearly
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103099:121"/>
concerned him, and for which in all probability he was very suddenly to render an account to God: a Confession most necessary both for him to <hi>make,</hi> and the Minister to <hi>require,</hi> before he could be thought a fit receiver <hi>of those dreadful mysteries</hi>: but after this general Confession, having received the Sacrament, Master <hi>Cotterell</hi> commending him to the grace of God, for that time left him; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by one or two visits, after that, as he thought gained some interest in the Colonel, coming again to him and finding him in a calm Temper, and judging it a fit oportunity to inquire into his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and to sound him what perswasion he now had of his taking up Arms against his Sovereign, he desired the Colonel to command his servants out of the room, that he might speak with him in private, which being done, and all witnesses re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, but God, and their own Consciences, Master <hi>Cotterell,</hi> prefacing his discourse, with a solemn Protestation, that in what he did, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed no other end, but the salvation of his Soul, demanded of him, whether he were not sorry for drawing his sword against the King? and whether he were not perswaded in his Conscience of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulness of it? To which the Colonel replyed, <hi>that he was perswaded, that it was lawful, having taken up Arms not against the King, but for the King, for his good, to bring him back to his Parliament, to make him more glorious than any of his Predecessors, and to redeem him from his evil Counsellors, and those Popish Malignants that were about him.</hi> To which old, thredbare pretences (invented to palliate Treason, and blanch their most gross Rebellion) when Master <hi>Cotterell</hi> opposed the Laws of God, the Laws of the Kingdom, and seconded both, by the Kings most

clear and satisfactory Declarations, able to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the abused World, and dispel that mist of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and prejudice, which the heads of this Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion had cast before the eyes of the People of this deluded Nation: the Colonel not able to return any reasonable answer, or pre-instructed by <hi>Sedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> who foresaw what encounter he was like to meet withal, suddenly called aloud to his servants to come in, whose presence set an end to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: after this, Master <hi>Cotterell</hi> (some say by Doctor <hi>Bruce</hi> his Physicians advice, though I do not absolutely affirm it) was wholly neglected, and Master <hi>Halsetor</hi> was sent for, Parson indeed of S. <hi>Nicolas</hi> in <hi>Worcester,</hi> but more acceptable to those that gave this Counsel, under another capacity, as he was the <hi>City Lecturer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before we acquaint you with what success <hi>Halsetor</hi> undertook, and discharged this imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it will not be amiss to let the World know, what reward this dying Colonel intended to bestow on Master <hi>Cotterell,</hi> for all his pains taken with him, when the Colonels Wife came to <hi>Worcester</hi> to visit her Husband, what pains he had taken in admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istring the Sacrament, and his great care in Praying and conferring with him: she very nobly pressed her Husband to gratifie Master <hi>Cotterell</hi> by some honorary gift, as an acknowledgment of his thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, that he might reap some of his <hi>Temporalls,</hi> to whom he had so plentifully sowed <hi>Spiritual things:</hi> to so reasonable a motion made by the <hi>Wife of his bosome,</hi> the Colonel most unworthily, and most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably replyed, <hi>Sweet-heart be content, we shall, find him a Delinquent:</hi> but he that shall <hi>reward a Cup of cold water,</hi> shall not forget so great a work of Charity: he that endeavours to turn <hi>a sinner to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:103099:122"/>
(though the success answer neither his labour, nor expectation) yet he shall <hi>shine as the Stars for ever and ever, nor shall his work be in vain in the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Master <hi>Cotterell</hi> being thus most unthankfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, the Colonel is now committed wholly to the care of his new ghostly Fathers, Master <hi>Halsetor,</hi> a man of a Schysmatical Turbulent Spirit, fitter to make a Rebel than reclaim a relapsed Traitor: and since hath followed that counsel which he gave by deserting his Cure and joyning himself to the Rebels: the men of this Faction have an Art to torment per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext consciences, instead of comforting them, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing not so much the <hi>promises of the Gospel,</hi> as the <hi>terrours</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> as if the way to spiritual Consolation were through despair, and no way led to <hi>Heaven</hi> so sure, as what coasted by the confines of <hi>Hell</hi>; whether Master <hi>Halsetor</hi> dealt thus with the Colonel, I cannot say, perhaps he might go about as some others of his Faction have done to sow Pillows under their seduced Champions arm-holes, and to justifie the sinner in the sin, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring circumstances, questionless this was his way, but the sad effects of his Rebellion which the Col. felt in his body, and those flashes of horrour affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his guilty Soul, would not permit this dying man to be lulled asleep in so vain presumption: though at first therefore when Master <hi>Cotterell</hi> was with him to assist him in that great work to prepare him to stand before the Judgment Seat of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the preparatories were confessions and sorrow for sins (though but in the general) deprecations of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the wrath of God, and the like, some spiritual comfort, began to dawn in his benighted Soul, and that he might seal that obscure glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:103099:122"/>
of hope opened unto him in this <hi>valley of Achor,</hi> and obtain more, he desired to <hi>Communicate in the Body and Blood of Christ,</hi> yet after Master <hi>Halsetor</hi> came unto him, (<hi>woe, woe to evil Counsel,</hi> to use his own exclamation) it was observed that the Col. fell into strong distempers of mind, which sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grew to so great a height that he was utterly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted, even to raving, and madness: which amongst them that think of Gospel ineffectual, unless the <hi>spiritual man be mad,</hi> is taken for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted evidence of a <hi>Powerful Ministery</hi>: certainly it was a sad spectacle, to see him lye in this condition, and a horrid thing to hear, that his last breath, which should have been breathed out in Prayers, and deprecations, and humble Confessions of sin; should be spent in venting the wild fancies of his distracted brain: sometimes crying out, that <hi>his Chirurgion and servants had broken up his Trunks, and robb'd him of of his Gold</hi>: and by and by starting up, and crying out, that <hi>the Enemy was at the Walls of the City, and calling for the keys to lock up the Gates:</hi> Thus he lay divers weeks: and in these distractions dyed; dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things are these, but 'tis written, <hi>The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of heart.</hi> His <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> coming to visit him in this wretched condition (poysoned with the stench of his body) both fell sick of the small Pox, of which she dyed, and both of them lie Buried in the South Ile of the body of the <hi>Cathedral,</hi> in that <hi>Cathedral</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> where his Grandfather Doctor <hi>Edwin Sandys,</hi> afterwards <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> made his first step to the <hi>Arch-Episcopal</hi> honour, being first Consecated Bishop of that <hi>Diocess</hi>: and there laid the foundation of those fortunes, which descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this man, made him forget his own extraction;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103099:123"/>
and certainly it was no small aggravation of his sin, that being descended from an <hi>Arch-Bishop,</hi> and that Estate which made him considerable in the World, being raised out of the Revenues of the <hi>Church,</hi> and a <hi>Cathedral Church</hi> (a blessing which but few Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have attained unto, though advanced to the same, or the like dignity to raise a family) He should yet so far degenerate, so far forget himself, and the <hi>Rock from whence he was hewn,</hi> to be a Ringleader to so Barbarous a Rout, which beginning at <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> went on to ruine and deface all Cathedral Churches where they came, ending with that of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> were he had the undeserved Priviledg to be interr'd.</p>
                  <p>Thus as briefly as I could, I have given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the unhappy end of this miserable Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. In which I call God to witness there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing feigned, nothing suborned, there being nothing here recorded, but was is attested, by men beyond all exception. And I must appeal again to the same God, that this account is not given to that end to make his name, or memory odious, either with the men of this present age, or with posterity; I must confess I would disgrace the Sin, but my intent is, by this example to teach those that seduced as this Man was, to know and foresee in him, what end attends those, who forgetting all <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Loyalty,</hi> shall lift up their hands against their <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> and against their <hi>Sovereign</hi> in <hi>Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>

to this Church, with those of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>London.</hi> The unhappy loss of <hi>Earnulphus</hi> History, the thirty second Bishop of this See, deprives us of that light which discovered the various condition of this Church how long in the beginning it struggled with 'its own poverty, and in after ages with the injuries of time and War, remaining some Years in a kind of widowhood, without the government and superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of a Bishop; till at last <hi>Gundulfus</hi> the thirtieth Bishop of this See, reedified this Church from the ground, and brought it into that magnificence, in which we now see it: to which pious work, he brought so good, so vigorous affections, that as <hi>Maelmesbury</hi> records of him <hi>Praevenerat vivacitas Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulfi omnium successorum diligentiam, Gundulphus</hi> ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity in that work did so prevent the piety of his successors, that he hardly left them any place in this kind, wherein to exercise their bounty.

While the Rebels were pull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the Rails about the Communion-Table, one of the Prebends of the Church, Master <hi>Larken,</hi> interposed, and attempted to stay their madness by reason, and perswasion; but he quickly found, that he did not only prophane Reason, by urging it to S. <hi>Pauls, Absurd, unreasonable, wicked men,</hi> men made up of <hi>Incongruities,</hi> but that he did it to the hazard of his life; for one of the Rebels, instead of returning a reasonable answer, discharged a Pistol, or Carbine at him, to have murdered him at the very Altar, but by the good providence of God he miss'd his mark. Thus having done some spoil, that they might render themselves not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unprofitable to their party, and not daring
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103099:126"/>
for the present, to do any more, for fear of losing that party which they hoped to gain, for that reason, they left the Church: but into what further out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious Impieties, their Schismatical fury hath since transported them, or what else they have practised on this Church, to compleat their <hi>Monstrous Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> is not yet made known unto us.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>third instance,</hi> which I shall give of the Rebels Sacrilege and Profaneness, is in the <hi>Cathedral Church of Chichester</hi>; Successour in the honour of being the seat of the Bishops Residence to <hi>Sealesey</hi>: for <hi>Wilfrid</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> being driven into Exile by <hi>Egfrid</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> retiring himself into <hi>Sussex,</hi> and finding the <hi>South Saxons</hi> wholly given up to Idolatry, his Spirit, like S. <hi>Pauls</hi> at <hi>Athens, was stirred within him,</hi> and knowing the <hi>unprofitable servants</hi> doom, that <hi>Buried his Talent,</hi> he Preached unto them the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>: and <hi>Edil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walch</hi> King of those parts (not long before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the faith, by the perswasion of <hi>Wolfhere</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians</hi>) willing that the same saving knowledg, which he himself had imbraced, should be imparted to his People, seconded the pious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of <hi>Wilfrid,</hi> and therefore amongst other acts of bounty, he gave the Arch-Bishop, <hi>Sealesey</hi> for the palce of his residence. Not long after <hi>Ced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walla,</hi> Conquering <hi>Edilwalch,</hi> built here a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery to the honour (as <hi>Malmsbury</hi> saies) of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and erected the Episcopal Chair: where it stood fixt the succession of 22. Bishops, or as others say (reckoning <hi>Wilfrid</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>York</hi> for the first) the succession of 23 Bishops; from the year 711. the Reign of <hi>William the Conquerour</hi> 1070. at which time <hi>Stiganeus</hi> translated his Chair from <hi>Sealesey</hi> to <hi>Chichester,</hi> and so became the last Bishop
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:103099:126"/>
of <hi>Sealesey,</hi> and the first of <hi>Chichester,</hi> where the Episcopal power did flourish ever since, until now; in these last, and worst days, wherein while the heads of a Rebellious, Schismatical Faction, Vote down the sacred Function and Order of Bishops, their Emissaries are mad to deface, if not utterly to demolish their Churches. To this purpose, the Rebels under the Conduct of Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> entering the City of <hi>Chichester</hi> on <hi>Innocents</hi> day, 1642. the next day, their first business was to Plunder the Cathedral Church; the Marshal therefore and some other Officers having entred the Church went unto the Vestery, there they seize upon the Vestments and ornaments of the Church, together with the Consecrated Plate, serving for the Altar, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the Lords Supper: they left not so much as a Cushion for the Pulpit, nor a Chalice for the Blessed Sacrament: the Commanders hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in person executed the <hi>covetous part</hi> of Sacrilege, they leave the <hi>destructive</hi> and <hi>spoyling part</hi> to be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by the Common Soldiers: brake down the Organs, and dashing the Pipes with their Pole-axes, scoffingly said, <hi>hark how the Organs go.</hi> They break the Rail about the Communion-Table, which was done with that fury, that the Table it self escaped not their madness, but tasted of the same fare with the Rail, and was broken in pieces by them. At the East end of the Quire, did hang a very fair Table, wherein were written the Ten Commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with the Pictures of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> on each side of the Table; possessed with a zeal, but not like that of <hi>Moses,</hi> they pull down the Table, and break it into small Shivers. 'Twas no wonder that they should break the Commandments in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation, that had before broken them all over
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103099:127"/>
in their Substance, and Sanction: they force open all the locks, either of doors or desks wherein the singing men laid up their Common-Prayer-Books, their singing Books, their Gowns and Surplesses: they rent the Books in pieces, and scatter the torn leaves all over the Church, even to the covering of the Pavement, but against the Gowns and Surplesses their anger was not so hot, these were not amongst the <hi>Anathemata,</hi> but might be reserved to secular uses: in the South cross Ile on the one side, the History of the Churches Foundation was very arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially pourtrayed, with the Pictures of the Kings of <hi>England</hi>; on the other side over against them are the Pictures of the Bishops as well of <hi>Sealsey</hi> as <hi>Chichester,</hi> began by <hi>Robert Sherborn,</hi> the 37 Bishop of that See, and the Series brought down by him to his own times at his own Charges, who as he made that of the Psalmist, <hi>Dilexi decorum domus tui domine, Lord I have loved the beauty of thy house,</hi> his imprease and Motto, so he made it his work, and endeavour. These Monuments they deface and mangle with their hands and swords, as high as they could reach: and to shew their love, and Zeal to the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> established in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> one of those Miscreants picked out the eyes of King <hi>Edward the sixth</hi>'s Picture, saying, <hi>That all this mischief came from him, when he established the Book of Common-Prayer.</hi> On the Tuesday following, they had a solemn Thanksgiving, for their success in gaining that City. Men of <hi>Cauterized Consciences,</hi> and given up to a <hi>Reprobate sense,</hi> thus, not only to <hi>take the name of God in vain,</hi> but damnably to Blaspheme it, as if he were the <hi>Patron</hi> of <hi>Rapine, Blood</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege.</hi> After the Sermon was ended, as men not inspired by the holy Spirit, of which they so much
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103099:127"/>
boast, but possessed and transported by a <hi>Bachana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> fury, they ran up and down the Church, with their swords drawn, defacing the Monuments of the dead, hacking and hewing the Seats, and Stalls, scratching and scraping the painted Walls: Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> and the rest of the Commanders standing by as spectators, and approvers of these Barbarous Impieties: yet for fear lest in the Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical frenzy, the sword in mad mens hands might mistake, Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> a wary man as he is, and well known not to be too apt to expose himself to danger, stood all the while with his sword drawn, and being asked by one of his Troopers what he meant to stand in that Posture? He answered, that it was to secure himself, you know, it is written, <hi>the wicked are afraid where no fear is,</hi> for though the <hi>People</hi> made him an <hi>Idol</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> yet being no <hi>Popish,</hi> but a <hi>Puritanical Idol,</hi> (for they have their <hi>Idols,</hi> and their <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as much as the <hi>Church of Rome</hi>) there was no danger to his person, to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken for an object of their <hi>Reformation,</hi> at <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester.</hi> The same Trooper added also, <hi>That if his Colonel in the Low-Countries were there, and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in cheif, he would hang up half a dozen of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers for examples sake: it not being the custom of the Low-Countries,</hi> (though long time hath made their enmity inviterate, and added much to the animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of the parties) <hi>to Plunder Churches, it being a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual stipulation between the</hi> Spaniard <hi>and the</hi> Holland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>that what Town soever should by Conquest pass from the possession of one Nation to the other, though the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour had the free Plunder of the Town, yet Churches with their ornaments, and what ever was conveyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, should be Inviolable, the Church being San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary to whatsoever was under its Roofe, and, if
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:103099:128"/>
they would have any thing thence, it was to be purchas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a valuable Price.</hi> These good intimations of moderation from a man of less Command, but more Religion than Sir <hi>William,</hi> prevailed nothing with him to restrain the outragious madness of his fellow Rebels. Having therefore made what spoyl they could in the Cathedral, they rush out thence and break upen a Parish-Church, standing on the North side of the Cathedral, called the <hi>Subdeanery</hi>: there they tear the Common-Prayer Books, both those belonging to the Church, and likewise those which were left there by devout persons which did usually frequent divine service; and because many things in the <hi>Holy Bible</hi> make strongly against them, one did contradict, and condemn their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious practices, they marked it in divers places with a black cole; 'tis more than probable that the 13. <hi>Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> did not escape their <hi>Index Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgatorious,</hi> for certainly if that be the word of God (as undoubtedly it is) they cannot so far <hi>withhold the truth in unrighteousness</hi> as not to read their doom in that word, they shall judg them at the last day: here they stole the Ministers Surpless, and Hood, and all the linnen serving for the Communion: and finding no more Plate but the <hi>Chalice,</hi> they steal that too, which they brake in pieces, to make a just and equal divident amongst themselves; for an <hi>Engineer</hi> of theirs, <hi>Robert Prince</hi> a French man with a wooden leg, afterwards shewed the foot thereof broken off; and when complaint was made of these barbarous outrages, Capt. <hi>Keely</hi> replyed, that <hi>he knew not whether all this were not done by Order, or no.</hi> About 5. or 6. days after, Sir <hi>Arthur Haslerig,</hi> demanded the Keys of the <hi>Chapterhouse:</hi> being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the place, and having Intelligence by a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103099:128"/>
Officer of the Church where the remainder of the Church Plate was, he commanded his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to break down the Wainscot, round about the room, which was quickly done, they having brought Crows of Iron for that purpose along with them; while they were knocking down the Wainscot, Sir <hi>Arthurs</hi> Tongue was not enough to express his joy, it was operative at his very heels, for dancing and skipping, (pray mark what Musick that is, to which, it is lawful for a Puritan to dance) he cryed out, <hi>there Boys, there Boys, heark, heark, it Rattles, it Rattles</hi>: and being much importuned by some members of that Church, to leave the Church but a Cup for administration of the blessed Sacrament, answer was returned by a Scotch man standing by, <hi>that they should take a wooden-dish</hi>: and now tell me which was farthest from a Christian, either this impure Scot, or that blasphemous Atheist, who seeing the massy Plate, and rich ornaments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Christian Altars were adorned in the Primitive Church, in indignation and scorn of Christ belched out <hi>En quam preciosis vasis Mariae min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istratur</hi>; Behold with what costly vessels the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> is served: what further spoyl and Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity they have since done to that House of God, <hi>and the habitation where his honour dwelt,</hi> is yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.</p>

                  <p>THE next instance which I shall give of the Rebels <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> and <hi>Profaneness,</hi> is in the Cathedral Church of <hi>Winchester:</hi> which <hi>City</hi> as it was the Royal <hi>Seat</hi> of the King of the <hi>West Saxons,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Heptarchy,</hi> so was it the <hi>Seat</hi> of the <hi>Bishops</hi> of that People, after <hi>Kenwalchus</hi> King of the <hi>West-Saxons</hi> (not brooking the Barbarous, broken expressions of <hi>Agilbertus</hi> his Bishop) divided this large <hi>Diocess,</hi> between <hi>Agilbertus,</hi> and <hi>Wina,</hi> and leaving <hi>Agilbertus</hi> to reside at <hi>Dorchester,</hi> caused <hi>Wina</hi> to be consecrated Bishop of <hi>Winchester.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we tell you by whom, and in what manner, this Church was robbed and spoyled of its orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and beauty, it will not be impertient (while it may serve as an aggravation of their impiety) briefly to set down, by whom this Church was built, and so richly adorned, as lately we saw it. This magnificent Structure which now stands, was began by <hi>Walkelinus</hi> the thirty fifth Bishop of this Sea: which work left imperfect and but begun by him, was but coldly prosecuted by the succeeding
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:103099:129"/>
Bishops, untill <hi>William Wickham</hi> (the magnificent Sole founder of two S. <hi>Mary Colledges,</hi> the one in <hi>Oxford</hi> commonly called <hi>New Colledge,</hi> the other a Nurcery to this, near <hi>Winchester</hi>) came to possess this See: He amongst many other works of Piety, built the whole Nave, or body of this Church, from the Quire, to the West-end, the Chappels on the East-end, beyond the Quire, had their several Founders: The hallowed Ornaments, and uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils of this Church, being many, rich, and costly, were the gifts of several benefactors, who tho their Names perhaps are not recorded in earth, have found their reward in Heaven. This Church was first differenced by the Name of S. <hi>Amphibalus</hi>; who received a Crown of Martyrdom under the Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of <hi>Dioclesian:</hi> Next it exchanged this name for that of S. <hi>Peter</hi>; and again, this, for that of S. <hi>Swithin,</hi> the eighteenth Bishop of this See: Last of all, it was dedicated to the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> whose blessed name is now <hi>called upon it</hi>: which Holy name though it could not but put the Rebels in mind whose possession and House it was, did not at all afford it patronage, and protection from their accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed rage, and madness.</p>
                  <p>The Rebels under the Conduct of Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> sate down before the City of <hi>Winchester,</hi> on Tuesday the 12. of <hi>December,</hi> 1642. about twelve of the Clock, and entered the City that afternoon between two and three: being Masters of the City, they instantly fall upon the Close, under a pretence to search for Cavaliers. They seize upon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends Horses, and demand their Persons with many threatning words: That night, they break into some of the Prebends Houses, such Houses as they were directed unto, by their Brethren the Seditious
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:103099:130"/>
Schismaticks of the City; and Plundered their goods. But the Castle not yet surrendred into the Rebels hands something awed their insolency: which being the next day delivered up to their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, did not only take away the Restraint which was upon them, but incouraged them, without check, or controul to rob, and defi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e, both God and all good men. Wednesday therefore and Wednesday night being spent in Plundering the City, and Close, on Thursday Morning between nine, and ten of the Clock, (hours set apart for better imployments, and therefore purposely in probability, chosen by them, being resolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane every thing that was <hi>Canonical</hi>) they violently break open the Cathedral Church, and being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, to let in the Tyde, they presently open the great West doors, where the Barbarous Soldiers stood ready, nay greedy to rob God, and pollute his Temple. The doors being open, as if they meant to invade God himself, as well as his posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, they enter the Church with Colours flying, their Drums beating, their Matches fired, and that all might have their part in so horrid an attempt, some of their Troops of Horse also accompanied them in their march, and rode up through the body of the Church, and Quire, until they came to the Altar, there they begin their work, they rudely pluck down the Table and break the Rail: and afterwards carrying it to an Ale-house, they set it on fire, and in that fire burnt the Books of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer, and all the Singing Books belonging to the Quire: they throw down the Organ, and break the Stories of the Old and New Testament, curiously cut out in carved work, beautified with Colours, and set round about the top of the Stalls
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:103099:130"/>
of the Quire: from hence they turn to the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Dead, some they utterly demolish, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers they deface. They begin with <hi>Bishop Fox,</hi> his Chappel, which they utterly deface, the break all the glass windows of this Chappel, not because they had any Pictures in them, either of <hi>Patriarch, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Apostle</hi> or <hi>Saint,</hi> but because they were of painted, Coloured Glass: they demolish, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the Monuments of Cardinal <hi>Beaufort,</hi> Son to <hi>John of Gaunt Duke of Lancaster,</hi> by <hi>Katharine Swin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> founder of the Hospital of S. <hi>Cross</hi> near <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> who sate Bishop of this See forty three years. They deface the Monument of <hi>William of Wainflet,</hi> Bishop likewise of <hi>Winchester,</hi> Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the Magnificent Founder of <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> which Monument in a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Piety, being lately beautified, by some that have, or lately had Relation to that Foundation, made these Rebels more eager upon it, to deface it: but while that Colledge; the unparralleld example of his bounty, stands, in despight of the malice of these inhuman Rebels, <hi>William of Wainflet</hi> cannot want a more lasting Monument, to transmit his memory to Posterity: from hence they go into Queen <hi>Maries Chappel,</hi> so called because in it she was Married to King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi>: here they brake the Communion Table in pieces, and the Velvet Chair whereon she sate when she was Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. They attempted to deface the Monument of the late Lord Treasurer the <hi>Earl of Portland,</hi> but being in Brass, their violence made small impression on it, therefore they leave that, and turn to his Fathers Monument, which being of Stone was more obnoxious to their fury: here mistaking a <hi>Judg</hi> for a <hi>Bishop,</hi> led into the error by the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:103099:131"/>
or counterfeit of a Square cap on the head of the <hi>Statue,</hi> they strike off not only the Cap, but the head too of the <hi>Statue,</hi> and so leave it. Amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acts of Bounty, and Piety, done by <hi>Richard Fox</hi> the fifty seventh Bishop of this See, he covered the Quire, the Presbytery, and the Iles adjoyning, with a goodly vault, and new glased all the Windows of that part of the Church, and caused the bones of such <hi>Kings, Princes,</hi> and <hi>Prelates,</hi> as had been Buried in this Church, and lay dispersed and scattered in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of the Cathedral, to be collected and put into several Chests of lead, with inscriptions on each Chest, whose bones lodged in them: These Chests (to preserve them from rude, and prophane hands) he caused to be placed on the top of a Wall, of exquisite workmanship, built by him, to inclose the <hi>Presbytery: there,</hi> never to be removed (as a man might think) but by the <hi>last Trump,</hi> did rest the bones of many Kings and Queens, as of <hi>Alfredus, Edwardus Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, Eadredus</hi> the Brother of <hi>Athelstane, Edwinus, Canutus, Hardecanutus, Emma</hi> the Mother, and <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor</hi> her Son, <hi>Kiniglissus</hi> the first founder of the Cathedral of <hi>Winchester, Egbert</hi> who abolishing the <hi>Heptarchy</hi> of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> was the first <hi>English Monarch, William Rufus</hi> and divers others: with these, in the Chests, were deposited the bones of many <hi>Godly Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Confessors,</hi> as, of <hi>Birinus, Hedda, Swithinus, Frithestanus,</hi> S. <hi>Elphegus</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor, Stigandus, Wina,</hi> and others. Had not the barbarous, Inhuman impiety, of these Schismaticks, and Rebels, shewed the contrary, we could not have imagined, that any thing but the like <hi>Piety</hi> that here inshrined them, or a <hi>Resurrection</hi> should ever have disturbed the repose of these <hi>venerable,</hi> yet not <hi>Popish</hi> Reliques. But these monsters of men,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103099:131"/>
to whom nothing is holy, nothing is Sacred, did not stick to prophane, and violate these Cabinets of the dead, and to scatter their bones all over the pavement of the Church: for on the North side of the Quire, they threw down the Chests, wherein were deposited the bones of the <hi>Bishops,</hi> the like they did to the bones of <hi>William Rufus,</hi> of Queen <hi>Emma,</hi> of <hi>Hardecanutus,</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor,</hi> and were going on, to practise the like impiety on the bones of all the rest of the <hi>West Saxon</hi> Kings. But the Outcry of the People, detesting so great inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, caused some of their Commanders (more Compassionate to these Ancient Monuments of the dead then the Rest) to come in amongst them, and to restrain their madness. But that devilish malice which was not permitted to rage and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow to the spurning and trampling on the bones of all, did satiate it self, even to a prodigious kind of wantonness, on <hi>those,</hi> which were already in their power: And therefore as if they meant (if it had been possible) to make these bones contract a <hi>Posthume</hi> guilt, by being now made passive Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of more than heathenish Sacrilege, and prophaneness, those Windows which they could not reach with their Swords, Muskets, or Rests, they brake to pieces, by throwing at them, the bones of <hi>Kings, Queens, Bishops, Confessors</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi>: So that the spoil done on the Windows, will not be repaired for a Thousand Pounds: nor did the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> find better measure from them than the <hi>dead</hi>: for whereas our <hi>Dread Sovereign</hi> that now is (the best of King) was gratiously pleased, as a pledg of his princely favour to this Church, to honour it with the gift of his own <hi>Statue,</hi> together with the <hi>Statue</hi> of his dear Father <hi>King James</hi> of ever blessed

Person,</hi> and the <hi>Emblems</hi> of his <hi>Sacred power,</hi> when the heads of this damnable Rebellion (who set these their Agents on work) offer worse affronts to his Sacred person <hi>himself,</hi> and by their <hi>Rebellions Votes,</hi> and <hi>Illegal Ordinances</hi> daily <hi>strike</hi> at the <hi>Substance</hi> of that <hi>power,</hi> of which the <hi>Crown,</hi> the <hi>Sword,</hi> and <hi>Scepter</hi> are but <hi>Emblems</hi> and <hi>shadows,</hi> which yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, ought to have been venerable and aweful to these men, in respect of their <hi>Relation.</hi> After all this, as if what they had already done, were all too little, they goonin their horrible wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, they seize upon all the Communion Plate, the Bibles, and Service-books, rich Hangings, large Cushions of velvet, all the Pulpit-Clothes, some whereof were of Cloth of Silver, some of Cloth of Gold: They break up the <hi>Muniment House,</hi> and take away the common Seal of the Church, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing it to be Silver, and a fair piece of gilt Plate, given by Bishop <hi>Cotton</hi>: they tear the Evidences of their Lands, and cancel their Charter; in a word, what ever they found in the Church of any value, and portable, they take it with them, what was neither, they either deface, or destroy it. And now having <hi>Ransacked</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> having <hi>defied God</hi> in his own house, and the <hi>King</hi> in his own <hi>Statue,</hi> having <hi>violated</hi> the <hi>Urns</hi> of the dead, having <hi>abused</hi> the <hi>bones,</hi> and <hi>scattered</hi> the <hi>Ashes</hi> of <hi>deceased Monarchs, Bishops, Saints,</hi> and <hi>Confessors,</hi> they return in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, bearing their spoils with them. The Troo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers (because they were most: conspicuous) ride through the streets in Surplesses, with such Hoods, and Tippets as they found: and that they might boast to the World how glorious a victory they had atchieved, they hold out their <hi>Trophies</hi> to all <hi>specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>: for the Troopers thus clad in the Priests Vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

rode carrying Common Prayer-Books in one hand, and some broken Organ pipes, together with the mangled pieces of Carved work but now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, containing some Histories of both Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in the other. In all this, giving too just occasion, to all good Christians to complain with the <hi>Psalmist, O God the Heathen are come into thine Inheritance.

of the <hi>Abbies,</hi> amongst the rest, <hi>Henry the Eighth</hi> suppressed this Monastery, and in the place thereof founded a <hi>Deanery, Anno,</hi> 1536. And two years after, added a <hi>Bishoprick</hi> to the <hi>Deanery.</hi> The Bishop sate here but nine Years, and again resigned his dilapidated Revenue, into the hands of a Dean; <hi>Middlesex,</hi> which was the Diocess of the Bishoprick, being devolved to <hi>London:</hi> yet though this Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of <hi>Westminster,</hi> as it relates to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> was but of modern Erection, yet in the time of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Britains,</hi> it was no less than the See of the Arch-Bishop of <hi>London:</hi> and therefore it is more than probable, that, that record which tells us, that the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Londons</hi> See, was planted in S. <hi>Peters in Cornhil,</hi> was either corrupted, or mistaken, for S: <hi>Peters in Thorney:</hi> for <hi>Sic olim à spinis,</hi> as learned <hi>Cambden,</hi> and other Antiquaries, affirm, from the great crop of thorns which heretofore grew there, that which we now call <hi>Westminster,</hi> was then called <hi>Thorney.</hi> This Church so <hi>famous</hi> for its <hi>Antiquity,</hi> so <hi>admired,</hi> for its <hi>Elegancy</hi> of Structure, especially by the addition of <hi>Henry the Seventh</hi>'s Chappel, a Pile of that polished magnificence, <hi>ut omnem Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantiam in illo acervatam dicas,</hi> as if art, and bounty, had conspired to raise it to a wonder of the World. Lastly, a Church so <hi>venerable,</hi> as being once the seat of an Arch-Bishop, and a Bishop, and now a long time the place where the Kings of <hi>England</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their sacred <hi>Unction,</hi> and <hi>Crowns</hi> at their <hi>Coronation,</hi> and where their bodies rest in honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Sepulture, when they have exchanged their <hi>Temporal,</hi> for <hi>Eternal Crowns. This Church,</hi> under the eye, and immediate protection of the pretended Houses of Parliament, had its share in spoil, and prophanation, as much as those Cathedrals, which
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:103099:134"/>
were more remote from them: for in <hi>July</hi> last, 1643. some Soldiers of <hi>Weshborne,</hi> and <hi>Catwoods</hi> Companies (perhaps because there were no Houses in <hi>Westminster</hi>) were quartered in the <hi>Abby Church,</hi> where (as the rest of our Modern Reformers) they brake down the Rail abut the Altar, and burnt it in the place where it stood: they brake down the Organ, and pawned the Pipes at several Ale-houses for Pots of Ale: They put on some of the singing mens Surplesses, and in contempt of that Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Habit, ran up and down the Church, he that wore the Surpless, was the Hare, the rest were the Hounds. To shew their <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> in the use of things, and that all <hi>Consecration,</hi> or <hi>Hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things,</hi> under de Gospel, is but a <hi>Jewish</hi> or <hi>Popish</hi> Superstition, and that they are no longer to be accounted holy, than that holy use, to which they serve, shall by the actual use only, impart a transient holiness to them, they set Forms about the Communion Table, there they eat, and there they drink Ale, and Tobacco: some of their own <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> (if my Intelligence deceive me not) bearing them company, and countenancing so beastly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation. Nor was this done once, to vindicate their Christian Liberty, as they call Prophanation it self, but the whole time of their abode there, they made it their common Table on which they usually dined, and supp'd, though <hi>S. Paul</hi> calls it <hi>despising the Church of Christ,</hi> and asks his <hi>Corinthians if they had not houses to eat, and to drink in.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. They did the easements of nature, and laid their Excrements about the Altar, and in most pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Church. An abomination which God did provide against by a peculiar prohibition in the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>; and that, in places not rendred so
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:103099:134"/>
dreadful, by so peculiar a manner of the presence of God, as in the hallowed Temples of his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worship: God would not permit the <hi>Jews</hi> to do these offices of nature in the <hi>Camp</hi>; they must have <hi>a place without the Camp,</hi> and a <hi>Paddle to dig and cover it</hi>; you have <hi>the Law,</hi> and the <hi>reason of the Law,</hi> both together, they must not do so; <hi>For the Lord thy God walketh in the midst of the Camp, therefore shall thy Camp be holy, that he see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee. Deut.</hi> 23.12. If God, for these reasons would not endure it in the <hi>Camp,</hi> how much more doth his Soul abhor such beastly uncleanness in his <hi>House,</hi> and <hi>holy Temple?</hi> Nay, which is the height of all Impiety, they famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly kept their whores in the Church, and which I tremble to write (Prodigious Monsters as they are) lay with them on the very Altar it self, and did in that place commit such things, as are unfit to be <hi>done</hi> by <hi>Christians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These remain yet two <hi>Prophanations</hi> more of this Church, not to be passed over insilence. The first was committed by Sir <hi>Robert Harlow,</hi> who breaking into <hi>Henry the Seventh's Chappel,</hi> brake down the Altar-stone which stood before that goodly Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Henry the</hi> 7. the stone was Touch-stone all of one piece, a Rarity not to be matched that we know off, in any part of the World: there it stood for many years, not for use, but only for Ornament: yet it did not escape the frenzy of this mans igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, for he break it into shivers. The second was committed on the 13. of <hi>December,</hi> 1643. When the Carcass of <hi>John Pym</hi> (as much as the lice left of it) was brought into this Church, and after a Sermon Preached by <hi>Stephen Marshall Arch-Flamen</hi> of the Rebels, and the Church Service Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiated

'Twas pitty, that he, that in his life had been the Author of so much blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and those many calamities, under which this Kingdom yet groans, and therefore deserved, not only to have his death with the transgressours, and wicked, but afterward <hi>to be Buried with the Burial of an Ass, drawn, and cast forth beyond the Gates of the City, Jer.</hi> 22.19. should after his death, make his <hi>Sepulchre amongst the Honourable,</hi> and mingle his <hi>Vulgar, Lowzy</hi> ashes, with those of <hi>Kings, Princes,</hi> and <hi>Nobles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>sixth</hi> Instance, of the Rebels <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> and <hi>Prophaneness,</hi> which I shall present unto the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is in the <hi>Cathedral</hi> Church of <hi>Exeter</hi>: which was once a <hi>Monastery,</hi> founded by <hi>Athelstane</hi> the Eighth King of <hi>England</hi> of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Race, and by him Consecrated to S. <hi>Peter.

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:103099:135"/>
the body of the Church: but he prevented by death, left the work imperfect: <hi>John Grandesson</hi> therefore, the seventeenth Bishop of this See, thinking the Foundation laid by his Predecessor <hi>Quivil,</hi> to be faulty in <hi>Geometrical</hi> proportions, the length not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing answerable to the height, added two Pillars more, to the length of the Nave of the Church; of a distance, proportionable to those laid before he closed up the end with a Wall of most Exquisite work, in which, he built a little Chappel, and in that Chappel, a Monument, wherein himself was intombed. He built likewise, the two side Iles, and covered the whole Fabrick with an Arch of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite work, and brought it to such perfection, that in splendour, and magnificence, it gives preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to few Cathedrals of the Kingdom: and which is very remarkable; though this Church was first began by King <hi>Athelstane,</hi> and made many steps before it came to arrive at its perfection, so that there are numbered almost <hi>five hundred years</hi> from the laying the <hi>first stone,</hi> to the covering of the <hi>Roof;</hi> yet the wisdom, and care of the several Benefactors was so great, that the most curious Surveyor, must confess, that the <hi>Symmetry</hi> of the <hi>parts,</hi> and the <hi>proportions</hi> of the <hi>whole,</hi> are so exact, as from the <hi>Foundation</hi> to the <hi>Roof,</hi> had been the work not of one <hi>age only,</hi> but of one, and the same <hi>hand</hi>: and that the Ornaments of the Church might be answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the beauty of the Structure itself, Bishop of <hi>Grandesson,</hi> bestowed upon it vessels of God, and vessels of Silver, Books, and all other kinds of rich furniture, <hi>Copiâ Immensâ, Immensi pretij: in exceeding great measure, of exceeding great price.</hi> All which, with many other things of necessary use, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ornament, became a prey to the Schismatical
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:103099:136"/>
Rebels; whose sin was so much the greater, because being neither <hi>inraged</hi> by <hi>Opposition,</hi> nor made <hi>insolent</hi> by <hi>conquest,</hi> (Apologies that may possibly be taken up for other Rebels, in other places, as <hi>Chichester</hi> and <hi>Winchester</hi>) but which was a main aggravation of their crime, <hi>Citizens</hi> within their <hi>own Wall,</hi> in <hi>coole Blood, not provoked,</hi> spoil, and lay wast their <hi>Mother Church:</hi> for after this City (now most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of those Priviledges, and honorary rewards, once purchased by their Loyalty, now forfeited by ingratitude, and Rebellion,) had once shut up their Gates against their <hi>King:</hi> it was not long before they shut up the Gates likewise of <hi>Gods house,</hi> deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all access to devout Persons, there to make their Prayers and Supplications: so near bordering upon <hi>Rebellion</hi> against the <hi>King,</hi> is <hi>Atheism,</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> for having demanded the Keys of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral, and taken them into their own Custody they presently, interdict divine service to be celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: so that for the space of three quarters of a year, the <hi>Holy Liturgy,</hi> lay totally silenced. Nor was the restraint upon the <hi>Reading Desk</hi> only, the <hi>Pulpit</hi> was made Inaccessible to all <hi>Orthodox, Loyal Ministers,</hi> and was open only to <hi>Factious, Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Preachers,</hi> whose Doctrin was Rebellion, and their Exhortation Treason, that so the People might hear nothing but what might soment their disloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and confirm them in their unnatural revolt, from their duty and Obedience. Having the Church in their possession in a most Puritanical, beastly manner, they make it a common Jakes for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onerations of Nature, sparing no place, neither the <hi>Altar,</hi> nor the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> though this last, finds a better place in their estimation, than the former: yet prophaned it was, nay so prophaned, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains

a doubt yet undetermined, which prophaned it most in their Kinds, either the <hi>Common-Soldiers,</hi> or their <hi>Lecturers.</hi> Over the Communion Table, in fair letters of Cold, was written the <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>blessed</hi> name of <hi>Jesus:</hi> this they expunge as Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious, and Execrable. On each side of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandmants, the Pictures of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> were drawn in full proportion: these they deface, they tear the Books of Common-Prayers to pieces, and as if this had been too small a contempt, and despite done to that form of Gods holy worship, they use them, as if they had been a second sacrifice of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Arts,</hi> and burn them at the <hi>Altar,</hi> with exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great Exultation, and expressions of joy. They made the Church their Storehouse, where they kept their Ammunition, and powder, and planted a Court of Guard to attend it; who used the Church, with the same reverence, that they would an Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, and defiled it with tipling and taking To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco: they brake and deface all the Glass win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the Church which cannot be repaired for many hundred pounds: and left all those ancient Monuments, being painted glass and containing matter of story only, a miserable spectacle of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseration, to all well-affected hearts that behold them. They strook off the heads of all the Statues, on all Monuments in the Church, especially they deface the <hi>Bishops Tombs,</hi> leaving one without a <hi>Head,</hi> another without a <hi>Nose,</hi> one without a <hi>Hand,</hi> and another without an <hi>Arm.</hi> A sad <hi>Emblem</hi> of that <hi>Trunk</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> which the accursed <hi>Atheists</hi> of these times have fancied to themselves, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured: a poor deformed, mangled, mutilated <hi>thing,</hi> having neither <hi>head</hi> of <hi>Prelation,</hi> nor <hi>face</hi> of <hi>Honour,</hi> nor <hi>arm,</hi> nor <hi>hand,</hi> nor <hi>finger</hi> of <hi>power</hi>

and <hi>jurisdiction</hi>: they pluck down, and deface the <hi>Statue</hi> of an Ancient Queen, the Wife of <hi>Edward the Confessor,</hi> the first Founder of this Church, mistaking it for the <hi>Statue</hi> of the <hi>blessed Virgin Mary, the Mother of God.</hi> So she was stiled by the <hi>holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church</hi> many years before it was in danger to be voted Blasphemy in that Committee where learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Miles Corbet</hi> sate in the Chair. They brake down the Organs, and taking two or three hundred Pipes with them, in a most scornful, contemptuous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, went up and down the street, Piping with them: and meeting with some of the Choristers of the Church, whose surplesses they had stoln before, and imployed them to base, servile Offices, scoffingly told them, <hi>Boys we have spoild your trade, you must go and sing hot Pudding Pyes.</hi> By the absoluteness of their power, they send forth their warrants to take away the Lead off a Conduit and a great Cistern that stood in the middest of the Close, giving plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful supplies of water to many hundreds of Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants; and by vertue of the same warrant they give their agents power to take a great quantity of Timber, which was laid up and designed for the repairing of the Church; such Timber as that it will be a very hard matter to procure the like, all Timber not being fit for that use: and with these a great stock of Lead out of the Common Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, reserved there for the same purpose; which warrants were accordingly put in execution to the full. They did enter into a Consultation about ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king down the Bells, and all the Lead that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Church, to convert them into Warlike Ammunition, the Bells might be cast into Cannon, the Lead into Bullets, both would serve towards the effecting their Traiterous designs. They took down
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:103099:137"/>
the Gates of the Close, which the <hi>Dean,</hi> and <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> had set up, and kept locked every night for their security: which Gates they imployed, to help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and strengthen their Fortifications: They lay intolerabe taxes on most of the Members of the Church, and whosoever refused to submit to those most unjust, Illegal Impositions, were threatned to have their Houses Plundered, and their Persons sent on shipboard; where they must expect usage, as bad as at <hi>Argier,</hi> or the <hi>Gallies.</hi> Doctor <hi>Burnell,</hi> a grave learned man, and Canon of that Church, refusing to submit to their Taxations, they gave Command (though he were at that time sick and confined, not only to his Chamber but to his bed) to take him in the night, and bring him away to Prison though they brought him in his bed: but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on much importunity, some of the best rank of the Citizens being tendered his security, to render himself a true Prisoner, for that time they left him. For the like refusal, they took Doctor <hi>Hutchenson</hi> another Canon of the Church, a man of a weak infirm Body, but of a vigorous knowing Soul; and violently carried him towards the Ship, there to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison him; by the way as they carried him along, he was (not only by the permission but by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of those that led him Captive) blasted, and abused, and howted at by the Boys, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the affronts, and revilings of the base Insolent Multitude: at twelve of the clock at night they sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on Mr. <hi>Hilliar</hi> in his bed, and another Canon of that Church, being almost Fourscore and Ten years of Age, and for the like refusal, because he would not disburse such sums as they demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the maintenance of this horrid Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, they carry him first to the Prison, and from
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103099:138"/>
thence to the Ship: in the way to the Prison, they throw dirt in his face, and beat the good old man so cruelly, that his roaring, and outcries were heard, and pityied by all his neighbours: and at last not able to endure (by reason of his extream old Age) the barbarous usage of the Rebels, he was forced to redeem his liberty at eight hundred Pounds: and now having dispossessed the owners, the Rebels find new imployments for the Canons houses: some of them they convert into <hi>Prisons,</hi> and in an Apish imitation, call them by the names of <hi>Newgate, Kings-Bench, Marshalsey</hi>; others they imploy as <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitals,</hi> for sick or maimed Soldiers: some they use as <hi>Slaughter-houses,</hi> and <hi>Shambles</hi>: and for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops <hi>Palace,</hi> they might have called it their <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> for in, and about it, they kept their fat Oxen, and Sheep, and all their Plundered Provision. These houses though fouly abused, yet do still stand, as to upbraid the Rebels injustice, and oppression; so to give entertainment to their own Master, or their successours, unless some men, possessed with worse devils than ruled in these children of disobedience, shall to their just damnation alienate them from their Original use: but other houses belonging to the Church, they set on fire, and burn down to the ground: for they burnt down the <hi>Guild-hall</hi> in S. <hi>Sidwels,</hi> belonging to the <hi>Dean,</hi> and <hi>Chapter,</hi> and as many houses more of their Ancient Inheritance and revenues as were worth 100 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewise great havock and spoil of their woods, and Timber, maliciously intending to disable them, from reedifying what they had most barbarously burnt down.</p>

God in his good time will, we doubt not, pour down his Judgments upon the Actors of these horrid Prophanations.</p>

                  <p>COuld we sooner have produced a certain, and full relation of the observable circumstances about the ruines and desolations of the sometimes flourishing, though now demolished <hi>Cathedral</hi> of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> the same might justly have challenged to have been inserted before this time and place, both in respect of the dignity of the Ancient, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and Royal Founders, the same of the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and unworthy defacers, the admirable vicis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situde of its own condition, and reasons of its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal doom, having suffered not so much by the fury of the <hi>Danes,</hi> because a rich Monastery, as by the zeal of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> because an Episcopal <hi>See</hi>: and (if his knowlege reached so high) for that it had been so much and often honoured by the Princes of this Nation in several ages.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Peada</hi> the first Christian King of the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> to propagate the faith of Christ, laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, but had a sudden period put to his life and pious intentions by his unnatural and wicked Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Wolpher</hi> his Brother, albeit at first averse, yet afterwards a convert to Christianity, (to expire the Murder of his two Sons whom he had cruelly put to death for embracing the Gospel before him) by
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:103099:163"/>
the help of his Brother <hi>Ethelred,</hi> and his Sisters <hi>Kimburga,</hi> and <hi>Kinswith,</hi> having finished that work in the year of our Lord 633. Consecrated it to the memory of S. <hi>Peter</hi> (whence the place ever since hath been stiled <hi>Peterborough,</hi> which before was called <hi>Medeswel-hamsted,</hi> or <hi>Medeshamsted</hi>) and it continued for the space of two hundred and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, in such glory, that in the Judgment of our Learned Antiquary, <hi>Monasterium fuit longè Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebratissimum,</hi> till the <hi>Danes</hi> massacred the Monks and destroyed that place of Devotion, which was after an 108. years restored to its former state, by <hi>Ethelwould</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> asisted by King <hi>Edger</hi> and <hi>Adulph</hi> his Chancellour, about the years of our Lord 960. in which it remained, until co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Sacrilege began to get the upper hand of wel-meaning charity in his Reign, who was as fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as truely said to have had <hi>Ingentes virtutes, nee minora vitia,</hi> though at the undoing of its Kindred, this had least reason to complain, being then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to a Bishops <hi>See</hi>; But this third woe hath so much disfigured that Majesty which till then this building retained in its fore-front, this <hi>Cromwel</hi> hath so far out-vied in acts of Piety his Precedent, that <hi>Cromwel</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. time, this place hath now suffered in so great a manner for its Loyalty, as that we know not where to enter upon the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the same, except at the great West-win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow (where his Soldiers made their first breach and entrance) which was adorned with such variety of Ecclesiastical History, as will evidence them to be deformers of that through-Reformation in our blessed Queens time of happy memory, whom not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they so highly cryed up. From thence they presently hurried to the Choire, where as soon
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:103099:163"/>
as they had broken open the doors, they, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their trade and custom in other places, fell on tearing in pieces the Books of <hi>Divine service,</hi> and sacred <hi>Anthems,</hi> yea (which may seem more strange) they were so hot against Preaching or hearing Sermons, that all the seats of the Auditours were plucked up and the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> the place of the Divine Oracle, and the Book seat pulled down with that black-mouthed cry, <hi>Down with that Throne of Antichrist, down with it even to the ground.</hi> And when their zeal had driven them, to that height of impiety, that some standers by could not behold it without great reluctancy, which moved one of them to request <hi>Cromwel</hi> that he would please to stay his Soldiers from further defacing and ruining that place, all the satisfaction he could get, was but a provocation to further mischief, replying, that his Gods were a pulling down, and when the other answered <hi>that the God he served was beyond the reach of Soldiers,</hi> Cromwel told him <hi>that they did God good service in that action,</hi> as if even in these days were fulfilled that prophecy of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 16.2. <hi>The time is coming whosoever doth the</hi> greatest <hi>Mischief will think he serveth God.</hi> But observe the wages that divine Justice repayed one of them for their work, which may testifie how he accepted of the same; When they had demolished the Choire, the East-end was the next they aimed at, where one espying in the roof right over the <hi>Communion-Table,</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> pourtraied, coming in glory with his holy Angels, and at the 4. corners, 4. Evangelists (none of which they will endure, as knowing how opposite they are unto them) he charged his Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet to shatter them down, but by the rebound of his own shot, was struck blind; If he did his God
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:103099:164"/>
good thereby, he did himself an ill turn, his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness falling on his own pate; He laid a long while in a woful condition, and never recovered his former sight: His life by Gods mercy was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preived, that he might repent, but he was surely scourged, that he might take notice, there is pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment for Sacrilege, and bear witness of that truth unto his fellows, although he found more savour than <hi>Calisthenes,</hi> who attempting to burn the temples by setting fire on the Gates, was for that act himself burned: or <hi>Alcimus,</hi> who whilst he was pulling the house of God down, was struck with a Palsie, and dyed in torment. Some would have thought, that that remarkable judgment over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking him so on the sudden, sufflaminated their running on, and that striking of him blind, should have opened their eyes. But let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet they will not learn righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in the land of uprightness will they deal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly, and will not behold the Majesty of the Lord; But Lord, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see, as thou foretoldest by thy Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> 26.10.11.13. it should come to pass, <hi>When other Lords besides thee have dominion over us</hi>; They were not at all deterred, neither left any ways un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attempted to get down that roof, which ladders failed, they cut the Bell-ropes (<hi>wich if rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, might have curred their itch</hi>) to eke out their tackling, till they reached it with their Poleaxes, and brake down the carved works. <hi>Psal.</hi> 7.4. Afterwards espying the rare structure of Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works over the Altar, admired by all travellers for the excellent artifices, which was no ways guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of superstitious workmanship, they made all of it rubbish, breaking up also the rails of which they
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:103099:164"/>
compiled bone-fires, tumbling the <hi>Communion-Table</hi> over and over, they were also so offended with all memorials of the dead (knowing themselves in the number of those whose memories at the best shall perish as if they had never been) that not one Monument in the Church escaped undefaced, no not of the pious benefactors, (whose accusation was sufficient, they had done good to the Church) not those two fair Tombs of <hi>Katharine Queen Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager of Spain,</hi> the <hi>Repudiate</hi> of <hi>King Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th.</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> albeit <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots.</hi> It was so great a crime to have been <hi>Queens,</hi> the marble walls, and guards of irons wherewith they were surrounded and incircled could not preserve them in repose from all their miseries, but they would add this one unto the rest, to lay the <hi>Emblems</hi> of their honours in the dust, pulling away the herse of black velvet, and carrying away whatsoever was vendible: When their unhallowed toylings had made them out of wind, they took breath afresh on two pair of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, piping with the very same about the Market place, lascivious Jiggs, whilst their Comrades dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced after them, some in the Coaps, others with the Surplices, and down they brake the Bellows to blow the coals of their further mischief, and left any should ring auke for the fire they had make, they left the Bells speechless, taking out their clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, which they sold with the Brass they flaied from the graven stones, and the Tin and Iron from other parts of the Church and Chappels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing thereto, which were many and richly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned, but the Daughters faired no better than their Mother; there was not suffered any window to remain unshattered, or remarkable place in them unruined, their intent being to leave those conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated

walls as a room fitted for vermin to nestle in, or which was worse for Cap. <hi>Ashwell</hi> to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise his Soldiers in, where while he was in town, he made his Rendezvous, and when they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, set fire on some part of the wood-work, to have burnt the remainder down, if it had not time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been discovered; Neither did the Cloysters at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, scape better than those they were made to wait upon, though these both in their roof and glazing might be compared with the chiefest <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrals,</hi> the first square being beautified with the History of the Old Testament, the second of the New, the third shewed the whole relation of those by whom the Church was builded, the fourth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented us with all the <hi>Effigies</hi> of our <hi>Kings</hi> since <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerour:</hi> But it seems; those unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and wicked men, care for scripture, and Princes, and Pious Monuments all alike, their wide throats were as open Sepuclhres, their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious appetites (being yet unsatisfied with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring) must needs swallow up the Lands apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to that Church, to whith that they might pretend the juster title, they broke open the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-house, Plundered away the great Charter, all the Evidences, leases, and other writings belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto, manifesting their parties desires to have all Estates of others, to come, and be at their arbitrary disposals, and they unto whom in right they are due, to lie as these places and Persons at this day, Mourning in Sack-cloth and Ashes.</p>

                  <p>IT is a memorable saying of an ancient Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Moralist, <hi>Curae leves loquuntur, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentes stupent:</hi> And the like may be said concerning sorrows; when they come once to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the heart, they stupifie it, and obstruct those passages, by which it should ease it selfe of them. This hath been our particular case: Our being deprived of our livelyhoods (for how small a trifle this insuing Remonstrance will manifest) hath filled our hearts with sorrow: But when we considered, not onely the hand foom whence this oppression cometh, (even that which pretendeth to the infallible weild of the sword of Justice) but withal that through our sides such a fatal stroke is given to one of the most famous Universities of Christendom: this sad prospect did so far sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge us with grief, that it cast us for a long time into a fit of Musing, till at last (the fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindled) we spkae with our Tongue.</p>

                  <p>And now that the string of our tongue is unty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, our earnest desire is, that none of these its sorrowful expressions may be mis-interpreted by any. And to that end we have perfixed this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement, to prevent three mistakes, which are all we can possibly imagin the malice of our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Enemies can any way fansie against this our Remonstrance.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>I.</hi> The first is, That perhaps it may be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, because we have not therein set down the express words, either of those Protections by which we might securely have expected an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity, or of those Orders by which we suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
                  <p>To which we answer, that the reason hereof was partly to avoid tediousness, and therefore we gave onely some short hints in the margent. And partly because (being despersed) we could not possibly have the true Copies of all of them by us. And to publish any thing that was but supposititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, could not consist with our constant endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour still to maintain the truth, notwithstanding whatsoever difficulties to the contrary. But yet (to prevent all mistakes as near as we can) we have here inserted the true Copies of such as we had by us: whereby the indifferent Reader will not onely guess at the rest, but also easily imagin what rigour and malice there was used in the execution of them, which we assure him are as much (or more) than he can possibly fansie. For they being to
<pb facs="tcp:103099:141"/>
deal with an Vniversity, which then had a reverend esteem over the whole Kingdom, must counterfeit <hi>Jacobs</hi> voice as much as possibly he could in their Orders, though their hands were far rougher than <hi>Esau</hi>'s in the execution of them. And accordingly (though now it is too apparent it was but only in mockery) we had sent us these two following Protections.</p>

                        <p>THE Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> Chancellour of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> having this day repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in the House the present condition of the said University; the Lords in Parliament apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that through the publick distractions, and by reason of great multitudes of Soldiers resorting from several places to the Town of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance might happen to the quiet and studies of the Scholar: For preventing therefore of any such mischief, have thought fit to declare the esteem and care they have of that ancient and noble Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary of Learning; and have accordingly Ordered, that no Person or Persons whatsoever, shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to offer any outrage or violence either by themselves or others unto any the Colledges, Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, Libraries, Schools, or other buildings belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the said University, or to any the Scholars or publick Ministers thereof: Nor plunder, purloin, deface, spoil, or take away any the Books, goods, chattels, or houshold-stuff of or belonging to the said University, or any Col. there, or to any Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or publick Minister thereof, under any colour

or pretence whatsoever, as they will answer the contrary to this House at their utmost perils.

Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nevertheless that this Protection shall not extend to stop any due course of Law, or proceeding of Parliament, that may or might have had its course if this Protection had not been granted. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ready obedience is to be given by all such whom this doth or may concern, as they will answer the contrary at their perils.</p>

                  <p>This Warrant was issued out the more sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and prosecuted the more violently, in regard that our Protections were then in procuring: But the rigorous prosecution of this, made those to be of little or no use, more than the name, unless it was to shut the Stable door after the Steed was stoln. For under pretence of <hi>Papists, Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,</hi> &amp;c. there was scarce a Scholar in all the Vniversity which escaped examination: And lest
<pb facs="tcp:103099:143"/>

                     <pb facs="tcp:103099:144"/>This, we hope, will satisfie the indifferent Reader concerning the truth and ground of our Sufferings.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>II.</hi> But lest a second mistake should arise, that (supposing them to be true, yet) they are not (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) so great as we pretend, because that for the most part we have given but a sleight glance at them; we held it very requisite to give this further Advertisement.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1.</hi> That in matters of this nature, a man ought not to macerate his Soul too much by reflecting on his own misery, lest the Devil thereby get an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage upon him, to tempt him to a melancholy despair. <hi>2.</hi> Though we desire hereby to move every compassionate Christian to a fellow-feeling of our miseries; yet have we endeavoured (as much as we could) to forbear the long insisting upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, lest we should offend his ears, instead of moving his compassion. For as in Musick, the harshness of a discord may be admitted if it be not too long produced; so have we studied to temper those harsh notes to the tender ear of the Christian Auditor, by making a speedy transition from one to another. <hi>3.</hi> We had so many mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of complaint, (and might have many more, if we had been all together to confer our Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) that this small Remonstrance would have swelled to (an <hi>Iliada malorum</hi>) a just Volum; if we had not purposely endeavoured to comprise an <hi>Ilias in a Nutshel,</hi> by instancing only in some,
<pb facs="tcp:103099:144"/>
and reducing those to as small a model as possibly we could. And to this end also we have used as much plainness of speech in our expressions, as ingeniousness of the truth of the thing it self. And indeed if we should but a little have indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged our Pen the liberty of a Rhetorical flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, we should thereby have made our suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings (which in themselves are almost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond belief) to have seemed altogether incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>III.</hi> But our greatest and last fear is lest the intolerable weight of those heavy pressures under which we have so long groaned, have (perhaps) extorted from us some expressions which may not seem altogether to become persecuted Christians. And in this we submit our selves wholly to the candour of the charitable Reader, desiring him to interpret all things in the best sense. For tho we have used our endeavours to avoid all manner of expressions which might seem to savour of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, yet carrying about us those passions which accompany flesh and blood, it is impossible but we should sometimes slip. We know very well, and acknowledge, that Prayers and tears are the only defensive weapons of a Christian against persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And if anything, which is not fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant hereunto, hath passed from our pen, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it may be imputed to our many infirmities; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are still ready to pray for our Persecutors, that God would open their eyes, that they may yet
<pb facs="tcp:103099:145"/>
see and repent of those many and great wrongs which they have done to him, his true Religion and Service, to his Anointed our gracious Sovereign, as also to us in particular, and other their fellow-subjects. Which if it would please him to grant unto them, we might quickly recover the temporal peace of this distracted Kingdom, and they the possibility of enjoying everlasting peace in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

                  <p>THough an Apologie for our long silence might better become us than any other form of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing, yet were there some that thought it better to sit down in the shade of cool patience, and sweeten the sad prospect of our own miseries, by reflecting on the great publick woes of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, than incur the suspicion of querulous natures, such as are apt to cry out only at the imagination of being hurt. But seeing our miseries are real, and our sufferings not so much intended against us, as against that famous University, whereof by right, we are still actual Members; and that the adverse party, hath hitherto made so much advantage of our tameness, as to steal away our livelyhood from us, and conceal the Theft: though our own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mouth be stopped, by violently seizing her press, and thereby not suffered to speak, but (like <hi>Apollos</hi> Statue of old) just as the evil spirit speaks in her, which at this time utters little else but disloyalty and Rebellion: yet seeing it hath pleased the hand of providence to give us this happy opportunity freely to bewail our own miseries; We are at length resolved to do Justice to these Mens iniquity and our own innocence, that our fellow-subjects may
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:103099:146"/>
know, (and if they leave so much learning as to speak in another language, the whole World may hereafter understand) how and by what Arts the <hi>Knipperdullings</hi> of this Age (who think shortly to make themselves Kings of this <hi>Sion</hi>) have reduced a glorious and renowned University, almost to a meer <hi>Munster,</hi> and have done more, in less then three years, then the Apostate <hi>Julian</hi> could effect in all his Reign, <hi>viz.</hi> broken the heart-strings of Learning and learned men, and thereby luxated all the joynts of Christianity in the Kingdon.</p>
                  <p>The particulars whereof, and the barbarous cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses taken to bring these designs to effect, as we shall truly and impartially set them down, so we fear not to appeal to any impartial Judg, whether if the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandalls,</hi> or even the <hi>Turks</hi> themselves had over-run this Nation, they would more inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly have abused a flourishing University, than these pretended advancers of Religion and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning have done; it being a constant custom (if not also the Law of Nations) in the fiercest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters of the most enraged parties, to exempt and priviledge Scholars from, if not protect them by their Martial proceedings.</p>
                  <p>To begin therefore with the first occasiion (as we conceive) from whence they pretended any cause of this rage and persecution against us, (though the meer conscience of so sensless a Rebellion cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up only by the illiterate herd, might afford rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son enough for them to look asquint upon all Scholars <hi>quâ tales</hi>) The contribution of a small pittance of Money to our Sovereigns extream ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity before any War was thought on by us, is made to be our unpardonable crime, (though not then prohibited by any Order or Ordinance) which
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:103099:147"/>
(added to the tenderness of our consciences in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing their wicked confederacy, commonly called the <hi>Covenant</hi>) by the help of their Legislative En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, has bereaved us of all, and cast us from our live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhoods, maintenance and Colledges.</p>
                  <p>For when His Sacred Majesty (whom they made to be the first Grand Delinquent, and whose Crown-Revenues and Estate, together with his Towns, Ships, and Magazines, they sequestred and seized on) deigned (by His Royal Letters) to acquaint His poor University with His strange wants, even of sustenance for his very houshold: Our hearts burned within us, to hear our living Founder, whom we expected to be made (by that time) <hi>a great and glorious King,</hi> (as was promised him) should almost starve while we had bread on our Table. Whereupon out of our poverty, a small and inconsiderable sum of Money was col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and tendered, as a Testimony not only of our Loyalty to him as King, or of our gratitude as our most gracious and bountiful Protector and Benefactor; but also of our Charity to him as a Christian, then in extream want and necessity. We hope our Persecutors will Pardon us this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, seeing our <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> may with less dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Treason abstract <hi>Charles</hi> from <hi>King</hi> than their bullets; and this was the first flower out of which they suck'd all their venom which shortly after they disgorged upon us.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon his Sacred Majesty (knowing well how eager that party was in revenging the least seeming provocation, and being informed of that Cloud which was then hanging over us and ours, for that action of Humanity, Loyalty, and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty) out of his care and tenderness, proffered to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103099:147"/>
secure our Colledge Plate (if we were content to deposite it in his hands) which their intended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, had already swallowed without any Grace, so much as of the <hi>publick faith</hi>: and therefore wrote his most gracious Letters to us to take an exact sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of it, not only for the weight, but also of the form of every piece, together with the Names, Arms, and Mottoes of the respective Donors, that if (perhaps) his Majesty could not preserve it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire as it was, he might restore it hereafter in the same weight and form, and with the same marks: All which he graciously insured upon his Royal word.</p>
                  <p>It behoved not us to refuse protection from that hand to which God (for that end) had entrusted a Scepter, especially considering the concurrence of Actions about that time. It is not unknown to most part of this Kingdom, that not long before this, the zealous Brethren of <hi>Essex</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> had packt themselves together in a Religious Rout, to give the first Essay of a Popular Reformation: How happily this work did thrive in their hands, has been already published to the Kingdom, and the ruines of the two magnificent houses of the Countess <hi>Rivers</hi> (with many other Gentlemens houses of quality) are still dismal witnesses.<note place="margin">Vid Mercur.

                     </note> So that (having found the sweet of their labours) the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers would in all likelyhood have prosecuted the <hi>great work</hi> as far as <hi>Cambridge,</hi> for a less prize than our University, (thanks be to God and our good Benefactors.) And we had good reason to fear the increase of their Army, if they had come near us, seeing the inferiour part of the Town, had provided Arms, and yet had no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:103099:148"/>
and some that durst discharge a Musquet, made it their practice to terrifie us, and disturb our Studies by shooting in at our windows. And therefore lest our Plate should become a bait to have our Liberties rifled,<note place="margin">This particular appeareth by a Paper delivered into the Registers Office, under the hands (if not also upon the Oaths) of Master <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Terne,</hi> and Master <hi>Anthony Walker,</hi> both of S. <hi>Johns</hi> Colledge, who had Musquets several times discharged in at their win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, as also divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> our Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge; pulled down, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps our Throats cut, we thought it our wisest course to secure all, by securing that in His Majesties gracious hands.</p>
                  <p>Upon these reasons (which no judicious man will esteem otherwise than weighty) we endeavoured to convey away some part of our Plate about the beginning of <hi>August,</hi> 1642. (which by the way was before either His Majesty Standard was erected, or his Proclamation issued out to that end: However many of us, and others have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for it, as fomenters of this War) But within a few dayes after, (see how the just grounds of our fears concentred) one Master <hi>Cromwell,</hi> Burgess for the Town of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and then newly turn'd a man of War, was sent down by his Masters above, at the invitation of his Masters below, (as himself confessed) to gather what strength he could to stop all passages that no Plate might be sent: But his designs being frustrated, and his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion as of an active subtile man, thereby somewhat shaken and endangered, he hath ever since bent himself to work what revenge and mischief he could against us. In pursuit whereof, before that month was expired, down he comes again in a terrible manner with what Forces he could draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and surrounds divers Colledges, while we
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:103099:148"/>
were at our devotion in our several Chappels, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away Prisoners, several Doctors of Divinity, Heads of Colledges, <hi>viz. D. Beale,</hi> Master of S. <hi>Johns</hi> Colledge, <hi>D. Martin,</hi> Master of <hi>Queens</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and <hi>D. Sterne,</hi> Master of <hi>Jesus</hi> Colledge, men of such eminent worth and abilities, as render them above the reach of our commendation, and these he carryes with him to <hi>London</hi> in triumph: And though there was an express Order from the <hi>Lords</hi> House for their imprisonment in the <hi>Tower,</hi> which met them at <hi>Tottenham-high-crosse,</hi> (wherein notwithstanding there was no Crime expressed) yet were they led captive through <hi>Bartholmew-fair,</hi> and so as far as <hi>Temple-bar,</hi> and back through the City to Prison in the <hi>Tower,</hi> on purpose that they might be houted at, or stoned by the Rable-rout.</p>
                  <p>Since which time, now about three years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have been hurryed up and down from one Prison to another at excessive and unreasonable charges, and fees exacted from them, far beyond their abilities to defray, having all their goods Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and their Masterships and Livings taken from them, which should preserve them from famishing. And though in all this time there was never any Accusation brought, much less proved against any of them; yet have they suffered intolerable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment ever since, both by Land and Water, especially that in the Ship, where for ten days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

In which condition, they were more like <hi>Gally-slaves,</hi> than free-born Subjects, and men of such quality and

condition; and had been so indeed, might some have had their wills, who were bargaining with the Merchants to sell them to <hi>Argiers,</hi>

                  <p>And now that we are mentioning our Reverend and worthy Heads of Houses, we may not omit, what our long exile from the said University will not suffer us otherwise than by certain Report to be apprehensive of: Namely, that a very great number of them are since in the same condition with us, that is, deprived of all, and banished: Particularly, the Right Reverend Father in God, the Lord Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> against whom their malice could invent no more than that he was a <hi>Bishop,</hi> nor pretend any thing, but that, being Vice-chancellour, he did according, to his Office Preach a learned and pious Sermon in S. <hi>Maries, Mar.</hi> 27. 1645. being the day of His Majesties most happy inauguration. To whom we may add that most Reverend and learned man, Doctor <hi>Collins,</hi> His Majesties Professor of Divinity, whose extraordinary worth and pains had continued him in that place almost thirty years, and made his name famous, and his person desirable in every Protestant University in Christendom: and yet his Loyalty and conscience caused our new pretended Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers to think him unworthy so much as of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Cure, (for they sequestred likewise both his Livings) though since, as we hear, they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored him to his Professors place, which none of them are able to discharge, and he living in their Quarters, durst not deny. Thus likewise have
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:103099:149"/>
Doctor <hi>Comber, D. Pask, D. Cosins,</hi> and <hi>D. Lany</hi> been deprived of their several Masterships and Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and some of them also Plundered of their goods, though all of them be very eminent for their Learning, Prudence, Judgment and Piety, among all that knew them, and have no prejudice of them. And for conclusion (as the Epitome of all) we add D. <hi>Holdsworth,</hi> whose universal approbation put him upon the troublesom office of Vice-chancellor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship for three years together in the beginning of these troubles; yet before his Triennial Office was expired, his person was seized upon and imprisoned, first in <hi>Ely-house,</hi> then (because they thought that was not expensive enough, though they had Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him of all) they thrust him into the <hi>Tower,</hi> only for his Loyalty in seeing His Majesties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands executed for the Printing of such Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> as were formerly Printed at <hi>York</hi>; which though the Committees before which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared have always objected against him as <hi>Licens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the Kings Books, yet hath he ever denied it, (for the manner, though not for the matter) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing himself before them, not to be so saucy as to offer to <hi>License</hi> any thing which His Majesty Commanded to be Printed: but yet still enjoyning the Printer (as he would answer the contrary at his peril) that the thing might be performed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to His Majesties Command.</p>
                  <p>And that the whole Body of the University might fare no better than the Heads; not long after the carrying up of the first three, they gave us an Argument of a sad presage. What was like to become of that Ancient and famous Seminary of Learning and Religion, when those Root-and-Branch-men chose that place for the prime Garison
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:103099:150"/>
and Rendezvouz of their <hi>Association</hi>: whereby the subtile Enginiers of the great pretended work of Reformation hoped not so much to gain security to their disloyal actions by any fortifications of that Town, (which it never was capable of, as now plainly appears) as some countenance and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity rather (which they had more want of) from the sacred name of an University to be listed <hi>Theirs.</hi> By this means instead of carrying us all to <hi>London Goals,</hi> (thanks be to our multitude, not their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) they found a device to convey a Prison to us, and under colour of Fortification confin'd us only in a larger inclosure, not suffering any Scholars to pass out of the Town, unless some Towns-men of their Tribe promise for him that he was a <hi>Confider,</hi> as they call it.</p>
                  <p>And after this intrenchment for almost two years together, (we are forced with unspeakable grief of mind to think) what prophanations, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, outrages and wrongs our Chappels, Colleges and Persons have suffered by the uncontrolled fury of rude Soldiers, notwithstanding two several Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections to the contrary, one from the <hi>House of Peers,</hi> the other from the <hi>Generalissimo the Earl of Essex.</hi> It is grievous to our memories to recount, how our Vice-chancellour and Heads of Colledges solemnly assembled in Consistory, being many of them threescore years old in an exceeding cold night till midnight, without any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations for food,<note place="margin">

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:103099:150"/>
following this their imprisonment, did constantly unanimously avouch and declare before the then General of the Association, <hi>That it was against true Religion and good Conscience for any to contribute to the Parliament in this War.</hi> Whereupon our Learned and Reverend <hi>Professors,</hi> two of Divinity, and one of the Law, the very <hi>Junior</hi> whereof (as well as the other two) had faithfully discharged his place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most so long as that by the <hi>Imperial Laws</hi> (his own profession) ever since <hi>Valens</hi> the Emperour, he might have challenged to have been <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Comes Imperii</hi>; yet all the encouragement any of them could get from these was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually to be harrowed by Plundering and tedious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment to betray their Loyalty, Learning, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences to the advancement of this present Rebellion, till at last that Reverend man (whom Posterity will honour henceforth as much for his Loyalty as his Learning) Doctor <hi>Samuel Ward</hi> (a man of known integrity and universal approbation even amongst those who were his adversaries in this Cause) took the wings of a Dove to flie away and be at rest: whose dying words (as if the cause of his Martyrdom had been written in golden Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon his heart) where breathed up to Heaven with his parting Soul, <hi>GOD BLESS THE KING.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And though the grave resolution of all the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Professors of Divinity and Law in so famous an university ought to be more sacred and powerful
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:103099:151"/>
with them than the noise of their new Teachers and obstreperous <hi>American</hi> Lay-lecturers, yet they are not ashamed, after all these (upon mature delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and consultation with the rest of the Learned men of that famous University) have publickly and unanimously declared their proceedings to be flatly contrary to <hi>Christian Religion and Loyalty,</hi> (and have stood therein even to imprisonment and death) to perswade the silly abused multitude, that all is for the <hi>Defence of His Majesty, and the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither is their wild fury confinable within those banks, it swells yet higher: for as the Tyrant wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>Rome</hi> had but one neck, that he might cut it off at one stroke; so these having got the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, imprisoned the whole University, <hi>March</hi> 23. 1643. which day the whole Senate, (the Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Body of it) being solemnly assembled in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent house,</hi> were there violently invironed with great Bands of Armed Soldiers, who wanted nothing but the Word to dispatch us, because we would not vote in a matter as they would have us, though that matter did not any whit concern them or their Cause, more than the conferring of a Degree upon such a man as the whole University in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences judged unworthy of it: And one Master <hi>Danes,</hi> (General of that famous Expedition, but formerly a Member of that house which he then so abused) adding Perjury to his former sins, came in a terrible manner, (contrary to his Oath former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken to his Mother the University) and flatly denyed the Vice-chancellour leave to dissolve the Congregation, unless he would first promise that the matter should be voted, as they required: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon sundry Members of that Senate, being obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:103099:151"/>
to make use of that Statute-liberty and freedom, which was essential to that assembly, were forthwith seised on, and imprisoned by the Committee, in no better Lodgings than the common Court of Guard: which strange and violent perverting of our Universities proceedings, we wonder at the less, for that this Captain had not done more to us, than Captain <hi>Ven</hi> with his Raggamuffins had done formerly to the <hi>sacred Senate of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that all Academical Exercises might expire and so the face of an University be quite taken away, a grave Divine (the Lady <hi>Margarets</hi> publick Preacher) going to Preach <hi>Ad Clerum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">M. Power.</note> (according to his Office) <hi>pridie Termini,</hi> was furiously pursued over the market place by a confused number of Soldiers, who in a barbarous uncivil manner cryed out <hi>A Pope, A Pope,</hi> and vowed high revenge if he offered to go into the Pulpit; whereupon the Church was straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways filled with great multitudes, and when some who accompanied the Preacher, told them, <hi>it was an University Exercise, and to be by Statute performed in Latin,</hi> they replyed, <hi>They knew no reason why all Sermons should not be performed in English, that all might be edified,</hi> threatning withal totear the Hoods and Habits which Graduats then wore, according to the University Statute. Yet all this may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be extenuated as a sudden uproar of undisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd Soldiers, but (which is the aggravation of all, and makes us believe that these petty Reformers were but the sensless instruments of higher Agents) when all this was related to their then General of the <hi>Association,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lord Gray of Warke.</note> no course was taken at all to prevent these grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103099:152"/>
mischiefs, but the Divine appointed by Statute to Preach <hi>Ad Clerum,</hi> was inforced to return <hi>Re infectâ,</hi> and glad he could escape so: And this is the great protection which Learning is like to find from these grand pretenders to advance it.</p>
                  <p>And that Religion might fare no better than Learning in the University Church, (for perhaps it may be Idolatry now to call it S. <hi>Maries</hi>) in the presence of the then General our <hi>Common-Prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book</hi> was torn before our faces, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding our Protection from the House of Peers for the free use of it,<note place="margin">See the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</note> some (now great one) encouraging them in it,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>M.</hi> Cromwell.</note> and openly rebuking the University Clerk, who complained of it before his Soldiers. Thus those Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Compilers of it, who sealed the truth thereof with their dearest Blood, being content to burn at a stake for the light of the Gospel, are now this second time Martyred and torn in pieces in their Liturgy, yet all this under pretence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>It will not be strange now to hear how our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons have been abused, seeing Religion and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have suffered so deeply amongst us: how divers of us have been imprisoned without so much as pretending any cause, but snatcht up in the streets, and thrown into Prison at the pleasure of a small sneaking Captain, where we have lain three or four months together,<note place="margin">Jordan.</note> not so much as accused, much less heard, but quite and clean forgotten, as if their had been no such thing in nature. How some of us (and many others with us) have been thrust out of bed in the night, that our Chambers might forthwith be converted
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:103099:152"/>
into Prison Lodgings: how our young Scholars with terrour have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to accuse and cut out the names of their own Tutors,<note place="margin">So at <hi>S. Johns</hi> College.</note> and some of them thrown into Prison for not being old enough to take their Covenant <note n="*" place="margin">So was <hi>Jo. Bullock</hi> of S. <hi>Johns.</hi>
                     </note>: But (to pass higher) how often have our Colleges been beset, and broken open, and Guards thrust into them sometimes at midnight, while we were asleep in our beds? How often our Libraries and Treasuries ransackt and rifled, not sparing so much as our Ancient <note n="*" place="margin">So at S. <hi>Johns</hi> College, whence they took in Ancient Coyn's to the value of <hi>22.</hi> l. according to weight.</note> Coyns? which those that know any thing, know to be a great light to the understanding of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. How often hath that small pittance of Commons which our Founders and Benefactors allotted for our sustenance, been taken from off our Tables by the wanton Soldier? How often have our Rents been extorted from our Tenants, or if received, re-manded of our Bursars and Stewards, and by force taken from them? And all this under the old odious title of <hi>Plundering,</hi> which word though they cannot endure to hear of, since that new term of <hi>Sequestration</hi> was invented; yet the thing is the same, and more practised than ever, they having for above two years together set themselves upon little else than to seise and take away our goods and furniture belonging to our Chambers, prizing and selling away our Books at a tenth part of their value, which are our only tools and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whereby the trade and profession of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing should be holden up. And to this end they have constituted a decay'd Hatter, Plunder-master
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:103099:153"/>
General, who (together with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticling Barber and a Confiding Taylor) hath full Comission,<note place="margin">Fortune. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell. Curd.</note> for our propriety sake, to Lord over us, and dispose of our goods as they please: So despicable a thing to them is an University, or any that belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
                  <p>But their malice is unsatiable, and cannot be contained within the Line of their Fortifications, and therefore to propagate their own wickedness, and make us odious and abominable to the whole Country, as we were already (though most unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly) to some of themselves; they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented a pretty device to reserve out of their Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all sorts of pictures, were they but Paper Prints of the twelve Apostles, and every market day to burn ihem openly in the market place, proclaiming them the <hi>Popish Idols</hi> of the University, until we became so hated by the weaker sort of the deceived People, that a Scholar could have small security from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stoned or affronted as he walked the streets.</p>
                  <p>But why do we insist so long upon particular mens Plundering, when whole Colleges (wherein not only the present, but also the future propagation of Religion and Learning is concerned) have drunk so deeply the dregs of their malice? For besides the cutting down of our Walks and Orchards, (contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their own <hi>Generalissimo's Orders of War</hi>) they have cut down the Woods and Groves belonging to our Colleges,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>So at</hi> Jesus <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege-</hi>
                     </note> and sold them before our eyes to a great value, when by an <hi>Ordinance</hi> they were declared not Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable: And (which was likewise contrary to an Order) they have seised and taken away the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials of our intended buildings, to the worth of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:103099:153"/>
three or four hundred Pounds in Timber, which our pious and charitable Benefactors had out of their devotion conferred towards the re-edifying of an ancient College which Time had impaired: And,<note place="margin">Clare-Hall.</note> to shew what violent passions they are transported withal, they have pulled down, demolished and defaced five or six fair Bridges of Stone and Timber belonging to several Colledges,<note place="margin">S. Johns, Trin. Kings, Garret Hostle, and <hi>2.</hi> at Queens.</note> and have spoiled a good Walk with a new Gate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to one of our <note n="*" place="margin">Kings College.</note> Colleges, upon pretence of keeping out Cavaliers, and yet for forty shillings they would fain have been hired to spare it, and cast up a Work beyond. And let the World judg whether this was not done to get the countenance of a Contribution from a College to their Fortifications, and consequently to this War against the King.</p>
                  <p>But (as if Bridges and materials for Building were nothing) they have yet proceeded further, even to the very Structure it self of one of the fairest Colleges in our University,<note place="margin">S. Johns Coll.</note> which they Plundered the true owners of, for above sixteen months together, as an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial argument of their love to Learning, and have converted all the old Court thereof into a Prison for His Majesties Loyal Subjects, (which before the other was built, has contained above three hundred Students at a time) not suffering any whom it concerned to remove any Bedding or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goods, whereof the Goaler could make any use or benefit, but renting them all out together with the Chambers at above five hundred Pounds <hi>per Ann.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:103099:154"/>And as if spoiling of one College were not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, their malice has since extended it self to all the rest, in Quartering multitudes of Common Soldiers, in those glorious and ancient Structures, which our devout and Royal Founders designed for Sanctuaries of Learning and Piety, but were made by them mere Spittles and Bawdy-houses for sick and debauched Soldiers, being filled with Queans, Drabs, Fiddlers, and Revels night and day. Which black deeds of darkness being divers times complan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by us to their Officers, and the particular men shewed them, who had thus lewdly abused our Colleges, none of these new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers were ever punish'd,<note place="margin">Pembr. Hall.</note> nor the holy Sisters removed, nor so much as called before any that then bore rule among us. By which means, (see what Religion they fight for, and what a glorious Reformation we may expect) they have dishonoured Cod, countenanced leudness, scandalized modest and civil men, and driven from us, or poisoned among us those young Students which were left.</p>
                  <p>To this we may add, how they have torn and defaced those Reverend buildings, pull'd down and burned the Wainscot of our Chamb. Bed-steeds, Chairs Stools, Tables, and Shelves for our Books, so as they may now have some plea for multiplying of Goals, if the Liberty of the Subject shall so require. And when their ragged Regiments which had lain lowzing before <hi>Crowland</hi> nigh a fortnight, were commanded to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> forthwith the Colleges are appointed for their Kennels, and fourscore were turned loose into one of the least Halls in the University,<note place="margin">Pembr. Hall.</note> and charged by their Officers to shift for themselves; who without any more ado broke open the Fellows
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:103099:154"/>
and Scholars Chambers, and took their Beds from under them. But when the Kings Prisoners taken at <hi>Hilsden-house</hi> were brought famished and naked in triumph by <hi>Cambridge</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> some of our Scholars were knockt down in the streets, only for offering them a cup of small Beer to sustain na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the drink thrown in the kennel, rather then the famished and parched throats of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as they esteem'd them, should usurp one drop of the creature. And it is much to be feared, thay would have starved them in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son there,<note place="margin">Mistris <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> maid.</note> if a valiant Chamber-maid had not relieved them by force, tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling under her feet in the kennel their great persecuter,<note place="margin">Homes.</note> a Lubberly Scotch Mayor.</p>
                  <p>What should we mention moreover, how we have been over-whelmed with insupportable Taxes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from us by Plundering, seised not by any of our own Body, but (which is directly contrary to our established privileges) by the Arbitration of a few confiding Aldermen, our professed Enemies, who instead of that gratitude which very nature requires at their hands, now repay us with unsati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able malice and Envy: which properties of their shave since commended and qualified them to be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Commissioners and Judges to strip us of our estates and livelyhoods. And when neither our consciences nor Estates could extend any further to defray their imposts for our very Chambers (which their Soldiers then possessed and burnt) besides all excises, weekly payments, Taxes, fifth and twentieth part, upon all our Revenues, and other such new terms of property and liberty, all the favour we can expect from them, is, quietly to be thrust into Prison without further abusings.</p>

For although we were seldom in any freedom for any time near these three years from some <hi>Protestation, Oath, Association, Vow and Covenant, &amp;c.</hi> menaced upon us, yet this last only brought with it the fatal doom of our final extirpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: though we must have leave to wonder that all <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> should be denied us by them, who latety pleaded nothing else against the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ecclesiastical Laws, and now pretended partly to fight for the same: But indeed the Covenant was not the true cause but the pretence only for our <hi>Ejection,</hi> (for that is the <hi>word of Art,</hi> for this new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invented Mistery) as appears by several writs issued out under hand and seal without mention of <hi>refusing the Covenant.</hi> The thing was absolutely determined by a peremptory decree, to plant a <hi>new University</hi> for propagating at least, if not inventing a <hi>new Religion</hi>: And to that end the old one must be removed, at least so much of it, for the present,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:103099:156"/>
as might hinder this great design; Only some means and plausible pretences were yet want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>The first that was attempted was to summon all those that were absent to return within ten days. But then they were so far to seek for reasons of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, as that after almost half ten days more stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy all they could insert in their writ was, <hi>For opposing the proceedings of Parliament, and other Scandalous Actions in the University</hi>;<note place="margin">See Pref.</note> Their tongues thereby testifying their minds, though perhaps out of incogitancy, which are so furiously set upon their great work of Reformation as to punish the <hi>opposing Scandalous Actions,</hi> with the loss of all a mans livelyhood. Whether they were ashamed of the phrase or not we know not; but they had very good reason to be ashamed of the Act, being so different from all shew of Justice, as to enjoyn impossibilities in commanding men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn within twelve days, after issuing the summons, which at that time were above two hundred miles distant, and had two Armies to pass through all the ways: or enjoyning them to be resident at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> whom themselves at the same time kept fast Prisoners at <hi>London:</hi> And yet for non-appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, for no man knows any other cause, these must be Ejected.</p>
                  <p>But though this be not so plausible, yet they have a sure reserve, their <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> which coming from their dear <hi>Brethren of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> they think no penalty too great for refusal of it: And this, because it carries in its frontispiece a pretence of <hi>Rrformation,</hi> comes not alone, but (though without any visible Order) accompanied with a new Legislative fangle called <hi>an Oath of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,</hi>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:103099:157"/>
but indeed was an Oath of Treachery, a wild unlimited device to call whom they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and make them accuse their nearest and dearest Friends, Benefactors, Tutors, and Mast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and betray the Members and Acts of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Societies, manifestly contrary to our <hi>Peaceable Statutes</hi> formerly sworn unto by us, which provide against all faction and sedition, which these men only hunt after, [<hi>viz. Non revelabis aliquod secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Collegii; Non malum aut damnum inferes Collegio aut cuilibet Sociorum:</hi>] And apparently reviving the Oath <hi>Ex Offishio,</hi> (as their Commissioners spell it) abolished this present Parliament, to accuse our selves: For what is it else to accuse our own <hi>Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>Corporations,</hi> whereof our selves are parts and members?</p>
                  <p>And though we would not any whit derogate from the Oath <hi>Ex Officio</hi> as it is used this day in most Christian Kingdoms and Common-wealths, nay even in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> and may be of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent use, if not stretched beyond the due limits of Law: yet this <hi>Oath of Discovery,</hi> all, we think, except one or two, refused, perceiving that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the design of a second <hi>Century</hi> was to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted; for they finding no accusation or crime ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected against any of us, where with to colour their ugly purposes which they had already plotted in private against us, and yet their Covenant must be for Reformation, they resolved to shrive us with an <hi>Auricular Confession</hi> sanctified to the <hi>Cause,</hi> that so we might help them out with their malice, which was otherwise like to be born blind, though hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto it hath been Eagle-eyed over our most ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial slips; And forthwith upon refusal of this Oath was their Solemn <hi>League and Covenant</hi> urged upon us.</p>

                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:103099:157"/>We cannot but signifie by the way, that seeing it must be tendered to the <hi>University,</hi> as their Printed instructions told us, we hoped it should have been to the whole body Statuteably assembled, either to admit of, or otherwise humbly to shew reasons of denial; but they were wise enough to foresee what entertainment such stuff was like to find from all the Learned men of so famous an Unversity, and were not willing it should be blasted with their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal refusal. And therefore contrary to our hopes, a selected number of particular men are cull'd out, partly as the lot sell, for it much resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a lottery, but chiefly of such whom they most redoubted, and of whom by some petty informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they had received a black Character of <hi>Loyalty</hi> termed <hi>Malignancy,</hi> and to these, yet severally, was tendered <hi>the Oath of discovery,</hi> and after that the <hi>Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And though indeed we should, by Gods help, as often have refused it, as it should have been offered, yet after one single denial, without a second tender, contrary to the Eleventh Article of the <hi>Instructions,</hi> a warrant was straightway issued forth under the Earl of <hi>Manchester</hi>'s hand and seal for our <hi>Ejection and Banishment from the University of Cambridge for refusing to take the Solemn League and Covenant, and other Misdemeanors in the said University,</hi> which were surely no other than the denial of the <hi>Oath of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,</hi> for not one of us who were there present, had any one accusation brought, much less proved against him, when we appeared upon their Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. And without any delay our names are cut out of the College Tables, and we <hi>strictly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in three days space to quit the University and Town under pain of Imprisonment and Plunder,</hi> if any thing was left.</p>

                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:103099:158"/>And it is here not to be passed by, that whereas by the Laws of the Land we were ever reputed to have as good an interest in our several fellowships during life, as any of our fellow Subjects in his fee Simple, provided we carried our selves according to those Statutes by which our several Colleges were respectively to be governed, yet now we are utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deprived of them by the mear Arbitrary power of one of our fellow Subjects without transgressing of any one Statute, or being called to answer for any pretended offence whatsoever.

                  <p>And now (seeing what courses were taken) it will not seem strange to the Reader, to hear that no less than 32. Fellows, (together with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster) have been thrust out of the said College, the emoluments of whose places have been ever since swallowed up by not half the number, and not content with that neither.

                     <hi>Root and Branch,</hi> leaving neither Fellow nor Scholar. In others indeed they have left perhaps one or two, (or more as they see

good) like <hi>Gibeonites, to hew wood and draw water,</hi> till such time as they have discovered unto them all the mysteries concerning their College Revenues, and by that time they will find enow godly men of their own Tribe, Learned enough to pocket the profits of two Fellowships apiece, which is the end of all this blessed Reformation. Thus is their old pretence of <hi>Regulation</hi> vanished, in place whereof their true intention of a total <hi>Extirpation</hi> of the whole ancient Body of the University doth now so plainly appear, that they which run may read it; which though a great many would not believe, till by woful experience they found it, yet was it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous enough from the very beginning to any that was but tolerably provident in matters of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>For it was hardly possibly that <hi>Cambridge</hi> should be free from these two crying sins of <hi>Sacrilege</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> which the devil hath long endeavoured to make this whole Kingdom guilty of: and to that end (mis-calling them by the names of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi>) had masked under the counterfeit vizard of a <hi>Covenant for Reformation:</hi> by which means though the simplicity of the vulgar was much abused, to the extreme hazard of this once flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church and State; yet seeing it could not be able to endure the strict search, which in such an University of all sorts of Learned and conscientious Men it was not like to escape; it could not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise expected, but that those who were his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments herein, would lay a sure foundation, and (how moderate soever their pretences were) reform <hi>Root and Branch,</hi> as they called it, that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they could not make the University of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> to Rebel by taking their Covenant, they might
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:103099:159"/>
at least make a Rebellious University at <hi>Cambridge</hi> which should take it.</p>
                  <p>And to this end those new intruders which falsly call themselves Masters and Fellows of our several Colleges, instead of those solemn Oaths which our pious and prudent Founders and <hi>Legislators</hi> enjoyned to be taken, (and without taking of which, no man can pretend any right to any of their founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) only take their <hi>Covenant</hi> again, and make a Protestation to reform all our wholsom Laws and Statutes according to that <hi>Covenant.</hi>

                  <p>A <hi>Covenant with Hell,</hi> begot between <hi>Munster</hi> and <hi>Mecha,</hi> by the help of a Jesuite, sthe most impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unchristian confederacy that their grand Master the devil could contrive: the chief end whereof is to dethrone the <hi>Lords anointed,</hi> and throw down the Church and Apostolical Government thereof, and to force not only their Fellow-Subjects to contradict their Oaths of Allegiance and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, but even their most gracious Sovereign to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, in violating this his sacred Oath which he so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly made at his Coronation. And to compleat that their most horrid and heinous sin, to joyn in Arms with a <hi>foreign Nation,</hi> to lay desolate their own native Country, to stain this Earth with the Blood of their own Country-men and Fellow-Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and to expose the treasures of <hi>England,</hi> the Cream of these fruitful Vallies, to the empty and hungry maw of a Rebellious Scot: and then vow never to have peace, but what shall be written in the Blood of their Enemies (His Majesty and His Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Subjects,) and lastly, most cruelly and wickedly to exhort and solicit all Protestants in the Christian World to undertake the like course with them by rising in Rebellious Arms; thereby exposing the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:103099:159"/>
Throats and Lives of all our Brethren the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants in France and else where to the just jealousie of their several Princes. And yet (for sooth) this <hi>Covenant</hi> is made the foundation of the great work of their glorious <hi>Reformation,</hi> and under pretence of refusing this we must be banisht, and thrust out of all we have.</p>
                  <p>It will not be more than what upon trial will be found true, if we here mention a mistery which many (we conceive) will not a little wonder at, <hi>viz.</hi> That this <hi>Covenant,</hi> for which all this persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath been, consisteth of 6. Articles, and those Articles of 666. words. This is not the first time that a persecution hath arisen in <hi>England</hi> upon 6.

                     <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Mr.</hi> Fox, Act. and Mon. Vol. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>443.</hi> Edit. London. <hi>1631.</hi>
                     </note>) But as for the <hi>number of the Beast,</hi> to answer directly to the words of those six Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, it is a thing, which (consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods blessed providence in every particular thing) hath made many of us and others seriously and often to reflect upon it; though we were never so superstitiously <hi>Caballistical</hi> as to ascribe much to numbers. This discovery (we confess) was not made by any of us, but by a very judicious and worthy Divine, formerly of our Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mr.</hi> Geast.</note> and then a Prisoner (for his Conscience) within the precincts of it, and not yet restored to his liberty, but removed to <hi>London.</hi> And therefore we shall forbear to insist any farther, either upon it, or the occasion of it.</p>
                  <p>For our own particulars we shall only add thus much, that seeing some of our own Reasons with which we had Armed our selves against that <hi>Misery
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:103099:160"/>
of iniquity</hi> have since that time been published to the World (in such humility of phrase as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Christian sufferers, though in such distraction as may sufficiently testify who were the Authors and what their Condition) we appeal to any who with Judgment and moderation hath or shall read the same; whether we have causlesly and foolishly trifled away those fair advantages wherewith God by the means of our renowned Benefactors had endowed us, for the advancement of his Glory, and further propagation of Learning and true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; or whether we had not rather suffer'd an unjust deprival of all our livelyhoods under the merciless hands of cruel Tyrants who neither fear God nor respect the just scruples of tender Consciences.</p>
                  <p>For when a Member of our Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity was brought upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion before the Earl of <hi>Manchester,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mr.</hi> Baldero.</note> and being not satisfied in Conscience, desired his Lordship that his Chaplain (then present) might resolve him in some Scruples about it; to this motion (being then thought not unreasonable by his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and much pressed by some that were there present) his Reverend Chaplain Learnedly replyed before the whole Company, that <hi>he came not thither to resolve Mens Consciences, but to Preach to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi> Whereupon the Gentleman was not long after sent up Prisoner to <hi>London</hi> by the said Earl for tendring the Reasons of his refusing the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, though invited and required thereunto by his Lordship: And there without farther hearing committed to Prison, where he continued a long time at excessive charges, which is all the satisfaction
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:103099:160"/>
he could find (or any other can expect) from them, for the scruples of a tender Conscience.</p>
                  <p>Thus are we imprisoned or banished for our consciences, being not so much as accused of any thing else, only suspected of Loyalty to our King, and Fidelity to our Mother the Church of <hi>England</hi>; and not only so, but quite stript of all our lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and exposed to beggery, having nothing left us to sustain the necessities of nature, and many of us no friends to go to, but distitute and forlorn, not knowing whither to bend one step when we set footing out of Cambridge, having one only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, which will make us rejoyce in our utmost afflictions, <hi>viz. A clear Conscience in a righteous cause</hi>: humbly submitting our selves to the chastisement of the Almighty, who after he hath tryed us, will at last cast his rods into the fire.</p>
                  <p>As for us, God forbid that we should take up any railing or cursing, who are commanded only to <hi>bless:</hi> we are so far from that, that we have rather chosen to let the names of our greatest persecuters rot in our ruines, than so much as mention them with our Pen, save only where necessity compelled us unto it.</p>
                  <p>But though we spare their names, we hope we may without offence to any describe their qualities: And therefore if Posterity shall ask, Who thrust out one of the <hi>eyes of this Kingdom?</hi> Who made Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence dumb, Phylosophy sottish, widowed the Arts, and drove the Muses from their Ancient ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation?

For though for our many sins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him we may justly receive at his hands, heavier Judgments than these: yet our Innocence will plead <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> to the face of any Man who shall object against us any Civil <hi>Misdemeanors,</hi> whereby we can more justly be deprived of our Fellowships than any free Subject in <hi>England</hi> of his fee Simple, if they please to say he is guilty of <hi>Misdemeanors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as it hath pleased our gracious Master (whose Ministers we are) to make us examples
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:103099:162"/>
(though but of suffering) to the rest of our Brethren: So we hope he will continue unto us his grace of <hi>humilation under his mighty hand,</hi> as an earnest of his <hi>exalting us in due time:</hi> And in the interim, that he will lay no more upon us, than he shall be pleased to strengthen our infirmities to bear: And that he will still preserve unto us a <hi>good conscience, that whereas</hi> our persecutors <hi>speak evil of us as of evil doers, they may be ashamed that falsly accuse our good conversation in Christ.</hi>

                  <p>YOU have here a canded and impartial Epitomy of an unnatural War, Subjects banding against their lawful Prince, Brother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Brother, and Father against Son. Read but the said ensuing Story, and therein consider the number and quality of Persons slain, the destruction of Houses and Families, the desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Cities and Towns, the increase of Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Orphans, the Tyranny and inhumanity of our new <hi>Legislators</hi> over their own Fellow-Subjects, and you will easily conclude of these, as <hi>Cicero</hi> did of <hi>Sylla's</hi> time,</p>

To be short, the Reader may here see the flux and reflux of <hi>Fortune de la Guerre,</hi> now this party flourisheth, and that goes down, anon that flourisheth, and this goes down, as if the guilt of our sins were drawing a heavy Judgment from Heaven upon this Land, and these Rebels were ordained for the instruments of it. But let us hope for better. And particularly, that God in the richness of his mercy, will look

down upon these macerated Kingdoms, and peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odize these distractions, That <hi>Religion</hi> may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain flourish in its purity, maugre the Plots and impieties of all <hi>Seditiaries</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> That His Sacred <hi>Majesty</hi> may be re-established in His just Rights and Prerogatives, that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may move in their own and known Centre, the Ancient <hi>Laws</hi> of the Land re-inforced and freed from fellow-subjects Tyranny and Arbitrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Subject re-estated in his Ancient Liberties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> freed from Murder, Rapine and Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: which that we may quickly see, let it be the Subject of ever good Christian Prayer.</p>

                     <p>The tenth of <hi>January</hi> following, his Majesty with the Queen, Prince, and Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> left White-hall, and went to Hampton Court to avoid the danger of those frequent tumults then hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the safety of his Royal Person.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>July</hi> the second the Kings ship called the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> Landed in the <hi>Creek</hi> of <hi>Kenningham</hi> near <hi>Hull,</hi> till which time His Majesty had not a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of Powder, nor any Arms, or Ammunition whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>July</hi> the 12<hi>th.</hi> the pretended two Houses Voted, <hi>that the Earl of</hi> Essex <hi>should be General of their Army, and that they would live and die with him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>August</hi> the first, the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> caused all the men then raised (being in number about 10000) to be committed to Officers, and divided into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, which men had been raising ever since the 12<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 1642. at which time he was made General of the Rebels.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>August</hi> the sixth the Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> having fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessely besieged the Lord Marquess of <hi>Hertford</hi> in <hi>Sherburn Castle</hi> for four days before, retreated to <hi>Yevell</hi>; the Noble Marquess sallied after him, and with a small number fell on that great body of the Rebels, Kill'd above 140 whereof 9 Commanders, took divers Prisoners and routed the rest; so as he marched away, and after divided his small Forces, going himself into <hi>Wales,</hi> and Sir <hi>Ralph</hi> (now Lord) <hi>Hopton</hi> into <hi>Cornwall,</hi> of both which there followed so good an effect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>August</hi> the 22<hi>d.</hi> His Majesty set up his Standard

Royal at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> for raising of Forces to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the Rebels then marching against him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>September</hi> the 23<hi>d.</hi> Prince <hi>RUPERT</hi> with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 11 Troops of Horse gave a great overthrow to the Rebels in <hi>Wikefield</hi> near <hi>Worcester,</hi> where Colonel <hi>Sands</hi> that commanded in chief, received his mortal wound, Major <hi>Douglas</hi> (a <hi>Scot</hi>) and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Captains and Officers slain and drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Captain <hi>Wingate</hi> a Member of the House of Commons, with four Coronets taken, and two more torn in pieces. This body of the Rebels was observed to be the flower of their Cavalry.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>October</hi> the 23<hi>d.</hi> was that signal great battel fought between <hi>Keynton</hi> and <hi>Edg-hill</hi> by his Majesties Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and that of the Rebels led by the Earl of <hi>Essex:</hi> wherein the Rebels lost above 70 Colours of Coronets and Ensigns, and His Majesty but only 16 Ensigns and not one Coronet. The exact number that were slain on both sides in this Battel is not known: But it is certain that the Rebels lost above three for one. Men of eminence of his Majesties Forces, who were slain in the Battel were, the two Noble and valiant Lords, <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Lindsey</hi> Lord High Chamberlain of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>George</hi> Lord D. <hi>Aubigney</hi> Brother to the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and <hi>Lenox,</hi> Sir <hi>Edmund Verney,</hi> Knight Marshal to His Majesty, with some other worthy Centlemen, and Soldiers, but besides these three named there was not one Noble Man or Knight kill'd, which was an extraordinary mercy of Almighty God, considering what a glorious sight of Princes, Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts, Barons, Knights and Gentlemen of all Orders, were not only present but engaged themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Rebels as much or more than Common
<pb facs="tcp:103099:169"/>
Soldiers, which they most cheerfully did by example of His sacred MAJESTY, whose Royal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Courage put life into every man, exposing His Sacred Person to so much danger as all good men do tremble to remember; His Royal Sons (the two young Princes) <hi>CHARLES</hi> Prince, of <hi>Wales,</hi> and <hi>JAMES</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> being also in the field in very much danger, if God whose cause it was) had not covered their heads in the day of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel. The Rebels as they had few men of quality to lose, so those they had, were sensible of their guilt, which then they expressed by their flight, some sculking into holes and Saw-pits, and others running out before they were well in the field. They lost of note the Lord St. <hi>John,</hi> eldest Son to the Earl of <hi>Bullingbrooke,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Essex,</hi> with many inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Officers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>October</hi> the 27<hi>th.</hi> His Majesty to compleat his Victory in <hi>Keynton</hi> field, drew his whole Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Banbury</hi>; but after the firing of one piece of Ordnance, the Rebels submitted to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties mercy (which were in number about 800 Foot (of the Earl of <hi>Peterboroughs,</hi> and Lord <hi>Says</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) with 10 Colours, and a Troop of Horse) and yeilded the Town and Castle to the King: at which time the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> with his shattered Force, were crept over the River <hi>Aven</hi> into <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> (full eight Miles backward from the place where they were beaten) there to secure those few he had left under the protection of the strong fituate Town and Castle, leaving behind him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 20 Waggons loaded with Powder and other Ammunition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>November</hi> the 12<hi>th.</hi> His Maiesty after four hours fight forced the Town of <hi>Brainford,</hi> where Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb facs="tcp:103099:169"/>
Colonel <hi>Quarles</hi> that commanded in chief was slain, and at least 400 more of the Rebels kill'd and drowned, as many taken Prisoners, with little loss to His Majesties part, these thus taken and kill'd, were observed to be the best foot Soldiers the Rebels had.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>November</hi> the 13<hi>th.</hi> (being Sunday) certain of the Rebels had come down the <hi>Thames</hi> from <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston,</hi> with 13 pieces of Ordnance, which (so soon as they could see) they fired against <hi>Sion</hi> house, and His Majesties Train of Artillery; but did little or no harm. Whereupon Order was presently given for drawing down some Pieces into the Meadow and to the River side against them; which was according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done: and likewise a Demy-Cannon planted near the South-end of the Town. All which were so judiciously plied, that they shot through their Boats and Barges, and at last fired the Powder in one of them, which blew up divers of the Rebels: Those Rebels which escaped took them to their heels, leaving behind them their mangled Boats and Barges, with all their Ordnance, and the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their Ammunition, on which His Majesty presently seised, and afterwards made an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and safe retreat to the City of <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>December</hi> the 5<hi>th.</hi> His Majesties Forces under the command of <hi>Lieutenant General Wilmot,</hi> having his own Regiment of Horse, with the Lord <hi>Grandisons,</hi> and Lord <hi>Digbies,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Pennimans,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Blagues</hi> Regiments of Foot, and Colonel <hi>Ushers,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Grayes</hi> of Dragoons, took the Town of <hi>Marlborough,</hi> defended by <hi>Robert Ramsey</hi> (a Scot) and about 500 Foot; <hi>Ramsey</hi> and divers of the chief Rebels brought Prisoners to <hi>Oxford</hi>; all their Arms taken, and four Colours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:103099:170"/>On the same 5<hi>th.</hi> day, the Earl of <hi>Newcastle</hi> laid siege to <hi>Tadcaster,</hi> where at that time was all the strength of the Rebels in <hi>Yorkeshire</hi> (excepting <hi>Hull</hi>) and by several assaults on the Town (from Ten of the Clock in the morning, till Seven at night) kill'd Cap. <hi>Lyster,</hi> and about 60 more of the Rebels, who found such hot service that they stole away in the night to <hi>Cawood</hi> and <hi>Selby,</hi> leaving <hi>Tadcaster</hi> fortified for His Majesties service.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>January</hi> the 19<hi>th.</hi> a great Victory was obtained by the Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> near <hi>Bodmin,</hi> in the County of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> where was slain in the pursuit 200 of the Rebels, and 700 taken Prisoners (amongst whom was Sir <hi>Shilston Colmadee</hi>) and eight Colours; good store of Ammunition, an five excellent brass Guns, and one of Iron.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>January</hi> the 22<hi>d.</hi> the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> assulted <hi>Saltash,</hi> forced the Town, where he took Ten pieces of Ordnance, 700 more Prisoners, 4000 Arms, and a Ship with sixteen pieces of Ordnance.</p>

                        <hi>January</hi> the 27<hi>th.</hi> certain of the Rebels under the command of Master <hi>John Hampden,</hi> to the number of 1800 Foot, and seven or eight: Troops of Horse, with two pieces of Ordnance, came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Brill,</hi> and made an assault upon it: But were so bravely repulsed by His Majesties forces there, under the command of Sir <hi>Gilbert Gerard</hi> (the then Governour thereof) that they made all possible hast away; His Majesties Horse having the pursuit of them, for above 4 miles, about 80 of them being sound dead, and betwixt 40 or 50 men wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which they had left together in a private House.</p>

                        <hi>June</hi> the 18<hi>th.</hi> 1643. His Highness Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> beat up the Quarters of the Rebels at <hi>Postcombe</hi> and <hi>Chinner</hi> in <hi>Oxfordshire,</hi> killed some 50 of the Rebels there Quartered, took about 120 Prisoners, almost all their Horses and Arms, and three of Sir <hi>Samuel Lukes</hi> Dragoon-Cornets: obtained a great victory in <hi>Chalgrove</hi> field, and utterly defeated the Rebels Horse-men and Dragooners, slew divers of their Commanders, especially Colonel <hi>John Hampden</hi> (one of the <hi>five Members</hi> accused of high Treason) who in this fight received his mortal wound, in this very <hi>Chalgrove</hi> field, where he first Mustered, and drew up men in Arms to put in execution the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Ordinance for the <hi>Militia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> the last of <hi>June:</hi> His Excellency the Earl of <hi>Newcastle</hi> obtained a great victory against the Northern Rebels under the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> upon <hi>Aderton-heath,</hi> within the County of <hi>Yorke.</hi> In which fight my Lord soon put the Rebels into such confusion, that they could not be reduced again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any Order; until he had gained all their five pieces of Cannon; which he presently turned against them; the sight whereof did so terrifie them, that they made what hast they could towards <hi>Leedes.</hi> But finding that his Excellencies horse had intercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that passage; their last shift was to recover <hi>Bradford,</hi> which was done in such a disorderly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that his Excellency in the pursuit of them kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and took above 2000, whereof above 1500 Pris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners.

                     <p>
                        <hi>July</hi> the 1<hi>st.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> being with his Army at <hi>Tame</hi> in <hi>Oxfordshire,</hi> sent Colonel <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> with 500 horse and Dragoons to <hi>Padbury</hi> to way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and his Forces from returning from <hi>Buckingham</hi> to <hi>Oxford,</hi> while <hi>Essex</hi> with his Army fell on the Prince, but Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> by his Scouts discovered the Rebels design, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly met them with three Troops of his own Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherewith he routed all <hi>Middletons</hi> 400 horse and Dragoons, pursued them to their pass at <hi>Werthill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook,</hi> followed them through the foard (in despight of all their Musquettiers there) slew above 100. took 40 Prisoners, and prevented the Rebels hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful design.</p>
                     <p>The same day the Marquess of <hi>Newcastle</hi> besieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Bradford,</hi> bestowed upon it above 40 shot from his great Artillery; and the morrow after made himself Master of the Town. In which he took 2000 Prisoners, with all the Horse Arms, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, which either the Rebels found in the Town, or brought thither with them.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon the Rebels deserted the Town of <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifax,</hi> and presently after Sir <hi>Hugh Cholmely</hi> fell upon <hi>Beverly,</hi> and took it for his Majesty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>July</hi> the 5<hi>th.</hi> Master <hi>Tomkins</hi> and Master <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loner</hi> were most barbarously Murthered by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels in <hi>London</hi> for their Fidelity to his Majesty; And the same fifth day, there was a fight on <hi>Landsdown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,</hi> betwixt His Majesties Forces under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Marquess of <hi>Hartford,</hi> and the Rebels under Sir <hi>William Waller</hi>; who (after 11 hours fight) stuck their lighted matches in the hedges, and ran quite away, leaving behind them above 500 Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets,
<pb facs="tcp:103099:173"/>
14 barrels of Powder, a whole Stand of Pikes, with good store of all sorts of Arms. Their Foot were absolutely routed, and all dispersed: his loss of Officers and horse was great, many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of his men were killed; His Majesties forces having the pillage of the field. And here was that most valiant Knight Sir <hi>Bevill Greenvill</hi> unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly slain in the Front of his men, with some others of less Quality.</p>
                     <p>The 13<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> about four a Clock in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon the King and Queens Majesty met at <hi>Edge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,</hi> where the Rebels had received their main over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw: and the same day and hour His Majesties Forces under the Command of the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> Lieutenant General of the Horse, the Earl of <hi>Carnarvon,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Crawford,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Biron</hi> obtained another great and strange victory upon <hi>Round-way-down,</hi> with 1500 horse, and two smal pieces of Cannon only: wherewith they total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly routed the Rebels Army under the Command of the old-beaten Soldier Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> consisting of above 2500 Foot, and 2000 Horse, besides 500 Dragoons, with 8 pieces of Brass Ordnance: slew 600 of them in the place, took above 900 Prisoners, all their Cannon, Arms, Ammunition, Waggons, Baggage, and Victual, 28 Foot-Ensigns, 9 Cornets, and left not one Rebel, but what was either killed, taken Prisoner, or narrowly, escaped.</p>
                     <p>Upon the 24<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> his Highness Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> having joyned his Forces to his Brothers, and the whole body of their strength being brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they sate down before <hi>Bristol,</hi> and began their Batteries. And the 26 day (with unexpressible valour) they gained the Out-works, and the 27 day following the City and Castle was delivered up to
<pb facs="tcp:103099:174"/>
His sacred Majesty, with all the Ordnance, Arms and Ammunition. At this siege were slain on His Majesties part Sir <hi>Nicolas Slanning,</hi> one of the <hi>Lunsfords,</hi> with some few others, and that valiant Lord, the Lord <hi>Grandison,</hi> did here receive a wound.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>August</hi> the 3<hi>d. Corf-castle</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Purbecke</hi> (which had been so often, before besieged by Sir <hi>Walter Earle</hi>) but had always beaten off the Rebels, and killed their Cannoniers, was once more fallen upon by the Rebels, who were so bravely received by Captain <hi>Laurence,</hi> that 60 of them were kill'd in the place: the rest hearing of the most valiant Earl of <hi>Carnarvons</hi> approach, ran away.</p>
                     <p>Soon after, the Earl of <hi>Carnarvon,</hi> Summoned <hi>Dorchester,</hi> which was thereupon delivered up to his Lordship, with all the Arms, Ammunition, and Cannon: which were disposed of for His Majesties use.</p>
                     <p>About the 9<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> the Castle and Isle of <hi>Portland</hi> were reduced again under His Majesties command; And the Town and Haven of <hi>Weymouth</hi> and <hi>Melcombe</hi> submitted to His Majesty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>August</hi> the 20<hi>th.</hi> Colonel <hi>Jo. Digby</hi> defeated the Rebels of <hi>Biddeford</hi> and <hi>Barnstable,</hi> killed 100 of their Foot, took 211 Officers and common Soldiers Prisoners, (most of which were miserably wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) two pieces of Ordnance, six barrels of Powder, 400 weight of Bullet, 200 and a half of Match, and above 300 Arms; besides all the Foot-Officers horses: Pursued their horse to the very works of <hi>Biddeford,</hi> and returned victoriously, without the loss of more than one man, not one of the rest of his Soldiers being so much as hurt all that day.</p>
                     <p>Upon the 2<hi>d.</hi> and 3<hi>d,</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> the Towns
<pb facs="tcp:103099:174"/>
of <hi>Biddeford, Appleford,</hi> and <hi>Barnstable,</hi> delivered up their several Garrisons to His Majesty.</p>
                     <p>Upon the same 3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> gave a very hot assault upon the City of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and battered the Walls, whereupon the Rebels desired Parley; but refusing the conditions, the assault was afterwards eagerly pursued, and the next day after won the great Sconce, turned the Ordnance there against the Town. Whereupon the Rebels craved to be admitted unto those conditions which before they rejected, and obtained the same, delivered up the Town and Castle to the Prince his Highness, with all the Ordnance, Arms, and Ammunition, after it had been blockt up and besieged about six weeks.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>September</hi> the 17<hi>th.</hi> the Rebels Army (stealing out of <hi>Gloucestershire</hi> towards <hi>London</hi>) surprised part of a new raised Regiment of His Majesties horse at <hi>Cirencester,</hi> but were overtaken by Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> with His Majesties horse, near <hi>Auburne</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> where he gave them two charges, the one by a commanded Party under Colonel <hi>Urrey,</hi> the other by the Queens Regiment, commanded by the Lord <hi>Iermin,</hi> who performed it so well on the Rebels whole Army, that many great bodies of Foot were routed, and many of them slain in the place, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any loss to His Majesties Forces, save two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Soldiers killed, and the Marquess <hi>de la Vienville</hi> taken Prisoner, (who was afterwards Murthered by the Rebels in cold Blood) and the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> and Lord <hi>Iermyn</hi> lightly wounded: by which two charges the Rebels Army was so retarded, that His Majesty had time to overtake them with his Foot, and on <hi>Wednesday</hi> after (the 20<hi>th.</hi> of this month) upon an Hill (near <hi>Newberry</hi> and <hi>Enborne-heath</hi>) His Majesty
<pb facs="tcp:103099:175"/>
fought with the Rebels, who were seated in the most advantageous place imaginable: yet in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight of all their Cannon, Foot, and Horse, His Majesty beat them from their ground; gained the Hill, and one piece of their brass Ordnance, and quickly routed all their horse upon the Heath. The most that were killed in this fight of His Majesties Forces, exceeded not the number of 300, though above 600 of the Rebels were slain, and a very great number wounded. In this fight were slain the most Noble and valiant Earl of <hi>Carnarvon,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Sunderland,</hi> the Lord Viscount <hi>Faulkland,</hi> Col. <hi>Morgan,</hi> Captain <hi>William Symcots,</hi> with some other Gentlemen and Commanders. After this fight the Rebels were further pursued, and routed again, so as they fled into <hi>Reading,</hi> where they durst not stay, but left the Town for His Majesty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>September</hi> the 25<hi>th.</hi> That pernicious confederacy, called the National covenant, was taken by the Members of the House of Commons at <hi>Westminster,</hi> in S. <hi>Margarets Church.</hi>

                     <p>In this month of <hi>October,</hi> His Majesties Forces under the command of the Lord <hi>Widdrington,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Henderson</hi> a Scot received a defeat near <hi>Horn-castle</hi> in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> by the Rebels under the command of <hi>Manchester, Cromwel,</hi> and <hi>Fairfax</hi>; there were taken Prisoners near 600 of His Majesties forces, Sir <hi>Ingram Hopton</hi> and some few others slain, not without some considerable loss to the Rebels,

                        <hi>June</hi> the 28<hi>th.</hi> This day the King coming before <hi>Banbury,</hi> found <hi>Waller</hi> drawn up in Battalia West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from the Town, on the side of <hi>Crouch</hi> hill, taking advantage of the hills, bogs, and ditches.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>June</hi> the 29<hi>th.</hi> His Majesty discerning that <hi>Waller</hi> would not come into the plain, nor could be assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as he lay but with much disadvantage, removed somewhat Northwards, to see if thereby he could draw him from his station, which succeeded accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, for <hi>Waller</hi> likewise advanced on the other side the River, whereupon the King at <hi>Cropready</hi> marched further off the River, leaving the Bridg in hope to draw them over, which <hi>Waller</hi> greedily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending as an advantage, put over 2000 horse and a great body of foot, with 14 pieces of Cannon. The Rebels being thus divided were immediately charged by the Kings Rear, the brave Earl of <hi>Cleve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> horse, and Sir <hi>Bernard Astleys</hi> foot, routing all that had past the Bridg whilst the Earl of <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton</hi> charged the rest of the Rebels horse that were fording over: In this fight were slain at least 300 Rebels, and many of them taken Prisoners with
<pb facs="tcp:103099:179"/>
their 14 pieces; there were slain on His Majesties part two gallant Knights, Sir <hi>William Butler</hi> and Sir <hi>William Clarke,</hi> and not above 14 common Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers besides, and so much for <hi>Wallers</hi> Army this Summer.</p>

                        <hi>July</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> The King having thus defeated one of the Rebels Armies bent Westwards after the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and came this day to <hi>Evesham</hi> to refresh his Soldiers after their hard duty, from whence he sent to <hi>Westminster</hi> his message for Peace of the 4<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>July.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the beginning of this month his Highness Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> marched out of <hi>Lancashire</hi> with a considerable Army for the relief of <hi>Yorke,</hi> which had been two months besieged by an aggregate bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Rebels, consisting of the Earl of <hi>Manchesters</hi> Army, the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and the Rebellious Scots under command of <hi>Lesley.</hi> The Prince had no sooner relieved <hi>Yorke,</hi> but drew forth after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and in <hi>Marstone</hi> Moore there began a terrible fight, wherein his Highness had at first much the better, took the Rebels Ordnance, and many of them Prisoners insomuch that <hi>Lesley</hi> and the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> thinking all had been lost, fled many miles from the place where the Battel was fought, and never came to the remainder of their Armies till two days after the fight, but in conclusion (whether by fate which attends the event of War, or by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect I know not) the fortune of the day turned, and the Rebels recovered their lost Ordnance and took some of the Princes baggage, and with it Sir <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> Col. <hi>Porter,</hi> and Col. <hi>Tillier</hi> Prisoners. In this Battel were slain on His Majesties part, the Lord <hi>Cary,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Metham,</hi> Col. <hi>Ewer,</hi> Col. <hi>Townley,</hi> with some others of note, and about 1500

                     <p>This done, the Rebels rally, and sit down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain before <hi>Yorke,</hi> which was valiantly defended for three weeks after by Sir <hi>Tho.

                     <p>In the beginning of this month His Majesties forces in <hi>Scotland</hi> under the command of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency <hi>James</hi> Lord Marquess of <hi>Montrosse,</hi> and General Major <hi>Mackdonald</hi> (who not long before landed in that Kingdom with 1000 <hi>Irish</hi>) obtained a great victory over the Rebels there upon <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigging</hi> Moore, near S. <hi>Johns Town,</hi> where were kill'd above 1200 Rebels, among which was the Laird of <hi>Rires</hi> and some others of note, and seven brass Pieces taken; this done, His Majesties forces pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued them to S. <hi>Johns Town</hi> and took it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and in the battel took 2000 of the Rebels Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, with two pieces of Ordnance more, all their Arms, Ammunition, and Baggage, and this done
<pb facs="tcp:103099:181"/>
with the loss of not above 60 men on His Majesties part. The Rebels in this battel were commanded by the Earl of <hi>Tullibairne,</hi> the Lord <hi>Drummond,</hi> the Lord <hi>Elcho,</hi> and Sir <hi>James Scot</hi> of <hi>Rossy,</hi> their word was <hi>Jesus, no Quarter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And within a fortnight after this success, his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency the Marquess of <hi>Montrosse</hi> and Major Gen. <hi>Mackdonald</hi> obtained a second victory over another body of Rebels in that Kingdom commanded by the Lord <hi>Forbes, Burly</hi> and others near <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Marquess kill'd and took Prisoners at least 1000 with three pieces of Cannon, and all their baggage, without any considerable loss on His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties part; among the Prisoners taken by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess, there was Sir <hi>William Forbes</hi> of <hi>Craigyvar,</hi> and <hi>John Forbes</hi> of <hi>Boynly</hi> with others of note: And soon after the Marquess took the Town of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> with all the Ordnance, Ammunition and Arms, and many of the fugitive Rebels therein.</p>

                        <hi>October</hi> the 7<hi>th.</hi> in the night Sir <hi>Richard Greenvile</hi> took the Town of <hi>Saltash</hi> by storming, wherein 400 Rebels were kill'd, and at least 300 taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners with their Arms, this Town had been quitted by His Majesties forces not long before without any considerable loss.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>October</hi> the 25<hi>th.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Northampton</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Gage</hi> raised the siege of <hi>Banbury</hi> Castle, fell upon Col. <hi>John Fines</hi> his flying Troops, slew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 60 of them, took above 100 Prisoners, with about 200 horses, one piece of Ordnance, all their Ammunition, and many Arms.</p>

                        <hi>October</hi> the 27<hi>th.</hi> The Rebels having thus lost two of their Armies, called the third (under the Earl of <hi>Manchesters</hi> command) out of the Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Counties, and forced other Regiments out of <hi>London</hi> to withstand the King, who was now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to <hi>Newberry</hi> with part of his Army, where the Rebels apprehending a great advantage in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that the rest of His Majesties forces were not come up, fell upon His Majesties quarters, but were beaten off, with the slaughter of above 1000 of their men, whereof Major <hi>Urrey</hi> with some other of their prime Commanders were part, with the loss of Sir <hi>Anthony St. Leager,</hi> and less than 100 others on His Majesties side, who had the pillage of the field; here the valiant Earl of <hi>Cleveland</hi> was casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally taken Prisoner, having his horse first kill'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him.</p>

                        <hi>November</hi> the 6<hi>th.</hi> His Majesty had his rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz on <hi>Bullington-green,</hi> betwixt <hi>Wallingford</hi> and <hi>Oxford.</hi>

                        <hi>November</hi> the 9<hi>th.</hi> His Army came to <hi>Dennington</hi> Castle, which since His Majesties marching thence, had been again besieged by the Rebels, and raised
<pb facs="tcp:103099:182"/>
the siege, the Rebels not daring to withstand his Army.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>November</hi> the 17<hi>th.</hi> The King having some days expected the Rebels, who it seems were loth to hazard the last stake, advanced towards them to <hi>Hungerford,</hi> upon whose approach, the Rebels left the field. Whereupon His Majesty sent Sir <hi>Henry Gage</hi> with a party to supply the wants ef <hi>Basing,</hi> that had been besieged all this Summer by five Colonels and their Regiments, but the Rebels had raised the siege before his approach.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>November</hi> the 19<hi>th. Monmouth</hi> that had lately been betrayed by <hi>Kirle,</hi> was bravely regained by the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> and <hi>Ragland,</hi> wherein was taken the Rebels whole Committee, 14 pieces of Ordnance, with store of Arms and Ammunition, 30 Officers and common Soldiers proportionable, whereby <hi>South-Wales</hi> is much secured.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>November</hi> the 23<hi>d.</hi> The King having thus victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, defeated two of their Armies and driven away the third, came to <hi>Oxford</hi> to entertain an overture of Peace, (certain Propositions being the same day come thither from <hi>London</hi>) having disposed of his Army to their Winter Quarters.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>November</hi> the 26<hi>th.</hi> A Vote passed by the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the House of Commons at <hi>Westminster</hi> for the utter abolishing and taking away of the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> with intention to set up a new device to be called a Directory in its room.</p>

                        <hi>December</hi> the 13<hi>th.</hi> His Majesty (out of his wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed desire of Peace) sent the Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> and Earl of <hi>Southampton</hi> to the Houses of Parliament at <hi>Westminster</hi> for a Treaty, as the best expedient for Peace.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:103099:182"/>About the middle of this month <hi>Helmsley</hi> Castle in <hi>Yorkeshire,</hi> (which had been gallantly defended during 16 weeks siege by Capt. <hi>Jordan Crosland,</hi> and some others) was delivered up to the Rebels under command of the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> upon ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable conditions to march away, the Governour and Officers with their horses and Arms, the rest without Arms. In this siege the Defendants (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others) made one remarkable salley where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they took Sergeant Major General <hi>Forbs</hi> a Scot Prisoner with divers others, here did Sir <hi>T.

                     <p>
                        <hi>December</hi> the 22<hi>d.</hi> Colonel <hi>Eyre</hi> with some horse from <hi>Newarke,</hi> took two Troops of horse at <hi>Upton</hi> belonging to the Rebels of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> brought the Men, Colours, Horses, and Arms, all safe to <hi>Newarke.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>December</hi> the 24. Sir <hi>William Vaughan</hi> Governour of <hi>Shrawarden</hi> Castle for His Majesty, fell on a party of Rebels at <hi>Welch Poole</hi> cammanded by Sir <hi>John Price,</hi> kill'd some, wounded others, took 47 Prisoners, 64 horse and many Arms.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>December</hi> the 28<hi>th.</hi> A party of the Lord <hi>Gorings</hi> Forces took Master <hi>Blakes</hi> house at <hi>Pinnel</hi> near <hi>Calne</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> and in it 59 Rebels, but more Arms.</p>

                        <hi>January</hi> the 1<hi>st.</hi> Young <hi>Hotham</hi> was beheaded on <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> his Father the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row after, both by Martial Law. Here the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may take notice of a special mark of Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for (the 23 <hi>April</hi> 1642.) when old <hi>Hotham</hi> denied His Majesty admittance into <hi>Hull,</hi> he held up his hands and prayed <hi>God never to prosper him or hiis posterity if he were not His Majesties Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:</hi> And now see both Father and Son adjudged by their fellow Members, and condemned by their own beloved Marshal Law, for intending to deliver up <hi>Hull</hi> to His Majesty.</p>
                     <p>The same first of <hi>January,</hi> the Lord <hi>Astley</hi> took <hi>Lypyate</hi> House in <hi>Gloucestershire,</hi> and in it 45 Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners with all their Arms, Victuals and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</p>
                     <p>Soon after this, Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale</hi> totally routed Col. <hi>Ludlowes</hi> Regiment of horse at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> took five Rebel-Captains Prisoners, besides under-Officers, and 80 common Soldiers, 150 Horse and Arms, with there Colours, <hi>Ludlow</hi> himself hardly escaping.</p>

                                 <p>THis is an uncomfortable time to Preach, yet I shall begin with a Text of Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Let us run with patience that race which is set before us, Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our Faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the Cross, despising the shame, and it set down at the right hand of the Throne of God.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>I have been long in my <hi>Race,</hi> and how I have looked to <hi>Jesus the author and finisher of my Faith,</hi> He best knows: I am now come to the end of my <hi>Race,</hi> and here I find the <hi>Cross,</hi> a death <hi>of shame</hi>; but <hi>the shame</hi> must be <hi>despised,</hi> or no coming to the <hi>right hand of God; Jesus despised the shame</hi> for me, and God forbid but I should <hi>despise the shame</hi> for Him; I am going apace <hi>(as you see)</hi> towards the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> and my feet are now upon the very brink of it; an Argument, I hope, that God is bringing me into <hi>the Land of promise,</hi> for that was <hi>the way through which he led his People:</hi> But before they came to it, He instituted a <hi>Passeover</hi> for them, a <hi>Lamb</hi> it was, but it must be <hi>eaten with sour Herbs,</hi> I shall obey, and labour to digest the <hi>sour Herbs,</hi> as well as the <hi>Lambe.</hi> And I shall remember it is <hi>the Lords Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over</hi>; I shall not think of the <hi>Herbs,</hi> nor be angry with the hand which gathereth them; but look up only to him who instituted that, and governs these; For men can have <hi>no more power over me than what is given them from above.</hi> I am not in love with this passage, through the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> for I have the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and infirmities of flesh and blood plentifully in me; And I have prayed with my Saviour, <hi>ut transiret
<pb facs="tcp:103099:184"/>
Calix iste,</hi> that <hi>this Cup</hi> of red Wine <hi>might pass from me:</hi> But if not, <hi>Gods will (not mine) be done</hi>; and I shall most willingly <hi>drink of this Cup</hi> as deep as he pleases, and enter this Sea, yea and pass through it, <hi>in the way that he shall lead me.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>But I would have it remembred (Good People) that when Gods Servants were in this boisterous Sea, and <hi>Aaron</hi> among them, the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> which persecuted them (and did in a manner drive them into that Sea) were drowned in the same Waters, while they were in pursuit of them; I know <hi>my God whom I serve,</hi> is as able to deliver me from this Sea of Blood, as he was to deliver the <hi>three Children</hi> from the Furnace, and (I most humbly thank my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our for it) my Resolution is now, as theirs was then; They <hi>would not worship the Image the King had set up,</hi> nor will I the imaginations which the People are setting up; nor will I forsake the <hi>Temple and the truth of God,</hi> to follow the bleating of <hi>Jereboams</hi> Calf in <hi>Dan</hi> and in <hi>Bethel.</hi> And as <hi>for this People,</hi> they are at this day miserably misled, (God of his mercy open their Eyes that they may see the right way) for at this day <hi>the Blind lead the Blind,</hi> and if they go on, <hi>both will certainly fall into the ditch.</hi> For my self, I am (and acknowledg it in all humility) a most grievous sinner many ways, by thought, word, and deed, and I cannot doubt, but that God hath mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in store for me (a poor penitent) as well as for other sinners, I have now upon this sad occasion, ransacked every corner of my Heart, and yet (I thank God) I have not found (among the many) any onesin which deserves death by any known Law of this Kingdom; And yet hereby I charge nothing upon my Judges; for if they proceed upon proofe (by valuable witnesses) I or any other innocent,
<pb facs="tcp:103099:184"/>
may by justly condemned; And (I thank God) though the weight of the sentence lye heavy upon me, I am as quiet within, as ever I was in my life. And though I am not only the first Arch-Bishop, but the first man that ever died by an <hi>Ordinance of Parliament,</hi> yet some of my Predecessors have gone this way, though not by this means; For <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phegus</hi> was hurried away and lost his head by the <hi>Danes</hi>; and <hi>Simon Sudbury</hi> in the fury of <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> and his fellows; Before these, S. <hi>John Baptist</hi> had his head danced off by a leud Woman; and S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> submitted his head to a persecuting Sword. Many examples (great and good) and they teach me patience; for I hope my Cause in Heaven will look of another dye, than the colour that is put upon it here. And some comfort it is to me, not only that I go the way of these great men in their several Generations, but also that my Charge (as foul as 'tis made) looks like that of the <hi>Jews</hi> against S. <hi>Paul,</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> 25.3.) For he was accused for the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Temple, i. e. Religion</hi>; And like that of S. <hi>Stephen</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> 6.14.) for breaking the <hi>Ordinances which Moses gave, i. e.</hi> Law and Religion, <hi>the holy place and the Temple</hi> (<hi>vers.</hi> 13.) But you will say, do I then compare my self with the integrity of S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Stephen?</hi> No, far be that from me; I only raise a comfort to my self, that these great Saints and Servants of God were laid at in their times, as I am now. And it is memorable, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> who helped on this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation against S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> did after fall under the very same himself. Yea, but here is a great clamour that I would have brought in Popery; I shall answer that more fully by and by; In the mean time you know what the Pharisees said against
<pb facs="tcp:103099:185"/>
Christ himself, <hi>If we let him alone, all men will believe in him,</hi> Et venient Romani, <hi>and the Romans will come, and take away both our Place and Nation.</hi> Here was a causeless Cry against Christ that <hi>the Romans will come</hi>; And see how just the judgment of God was; they crucified Christ for fear lest the <hi>Romans</hi> should come, and his death was it which brought in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> upon them, God punishing them with that which they most feared: and I pray God this clamour of <hi>Venient Romani</hi> (of which I have given no cause) help not to bring them in; for the Pope never had such a Harvest in <hi>England</hi> since the Reformation, as he hath now upon the Sects and Divisions that are amongst us. In the mean time, <hi>by Honour and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, by good report, and evil report, as a deceiver and yet true,</hi> am I passing through this World, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.8.  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

                                 <p>And first, this I shall be bold to speak of the King our gracious Sovereign; He hath been much tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced also for bringing in of Popery; but on my Conscience (of which I shall give God a very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent account) I know Him to be as free from this charge, as any man living; and I hold Him to be as found a Protestant (according to the Religion by Law established) as any man in this Kingdom; And that he will venture His life as far, and as freely for it; and I think I do, or should know, both His affection to Religion, and his grounds for it, as fully as any man in <hi>England.</hi>

                                 <p>The second particular is concerning this great and Populous City, (which God bless) Here hath been of late, a fashion taken up, to gather hands, and then go to the, Great Court of this Kingdom, (the Parliament) and clamour for Justice, as if that

A way, which may endanger many an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> man, and pluck his blood upon their own heads, and perhaps upon the Cities also: And this hath been lately practised against my self; The Magistrates standing still, and suffering them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly to proceed from Parish to Parish without check; God forgive the setters of this (with all my heart I beg it) but many well meaning People are caught by it. In S. <hi>Stephens</hi> case, when nothing else would serve, <hi>they stirred up the People against him</hi>; and <hi>Herod</hi> went the same way, when he had kill'd S. <hi>James,</hi> yet he would not venture upon S. <hi>Peter,</hi> till he found how the other <hi>pleased the People.</hi> But take heed of having your <hi>hands full of blood,</hi> for there is a time (best known to himself) when God (above other sins) <hi>makes Inquisition for blood,</hi> and when that Inquisition is on foot, the <hi>Psalmist</hi> tells us, <hi>That God remembers</hi> (but that is not all) <hi>He remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and forgets not the complaint of the poor,</hi> that is, whose blood is shed by oppression, <hi>verse</hi> 9. take heed of this, <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God,</hi> but then especially, <hi>when he is making Inquisition for blood</hi>; And (with my Prayers to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it) I do heartily desire this City to remember the Prophesie that is expressed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.14.15. <hi>As for me, behold I am in your hand: do with me as seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good and meet unto you. But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon your selves, and upon this City, and upon the Inhabitants thereof,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                                 <p>The third particular is the poor Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> It hath flourished and been a shelter to other
<pb facs="tcp:103099:186"/>
neighbouring Churches, when storms have driven upon them. But, alas, now it is in a storm it self, and God only knows whether, or how it shall get out; and (which is worse than a storm from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out) it is become like an <hi>Oak</hi> cleft to shivers with wedges made out of its own body, and at every cleft prophaneness and Irreligion is entering in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while as <hi>Prosper</hi> spakes (in his second Book <hi>De vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae contemptu cap.</hi> 4.) <hi>Men that introduce prophaness are cloaked over with the name</hi> Religionis Imaginariae, <hi>of Imaginary Religion</hi>; for we have lost the Substance and dwell too much in Opinion, and that Church which all the Jesuits machinations could not ruin, is fallen into danger by her own.</p>
                                 <p>The last particular (for I am not willing to be too long) is my self; I was born and baptized in the bosom of the Church of <hi>England</hi> established by Law; in that profession I have ever since lived, and in that I come now to dye; This is no time to dissemble with God, least of all in matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and therefore I desire it may be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, I have always lived in the Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, established in <hi>England,</hi> and in that I now come to dye. What clamours and slanders I have endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for labouring to keep an Uniformity in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal service of God, according to the Doctrin and Discipline of this Church, all men know, and I have abundantly felt.</p>
                                 <p>Now at last I am accused of <hi>High Treason</hi> in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: a crime which my Soul ever abhorred; this Treason was charged to consist of these two parts, <hi>An endeavour to subvert the Laws of the Land,</hi> and a like <hi>Endeavour to overthrow the true Protestant Religion estab<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                                       </gap>shed by Law.</hi> Besides my Answers to the several Charges, I protested my innocency in
<pb facs="tcp:103099:186"/>
both Houses. <hi>It was said, Prisoners protestations at the Bar must not be taken.</hi> I can bring no witness of my heart and the intentions thereof; therefore I must come to my Protestation, not at the Bar, but my Protestation at this hour and instant of my death; in which I hope all men will be such charitable Christians, as not to think I would dye and dissemble, being instantly to give God an account for the truth of it: I do therefore here in the presence of <hi>God,</hi> and his holy Angels, take it upon my death, That I never endeavoured the subversion either of <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Religion</hi>; and I desire you all to remember this Protest of mine concerning mine innocency, in these, and from all Treasons whatsoever. I have been accused likewise as an Enemy to Parliaments: No, I understand them and the benefit that comes by them too well to be so; But I did mislike the misgovernments of some Parliaments many ways, and I had good reason for it; for <hi>Corruptio optimi est pessima,</hi> there is no corruption in the World so bad, as that which is of the best thing in it self: for the better the thing is in nature, the worse it is, corupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And that being the highest Court, over which no other hath jurisdiction, when tis mis-informed or misgoverned, the Subject is left without all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. But I have done, I forgive all the World, all and every of those bitter Enemies which have persecuted me, and humbly desire to be forgiven of God first, and then of every man, whether I have offended him or not, if he do but conceive that I have. Lord do thou forgive me, and I beg for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of him, And so I heartily desire you to joyn in Prayer with me.</p>

                                    <hi>O Eternal God and merciful Father, look down upon me in mercy, in the riches and fulness of all thy mercies look upon me; but not till thou hast nailed my sins to the Cross of Christ, not till thou hast bathed me in the blood of Christ, not till I have hid my self in the wounds of Christ: that so the punishment due unto my sins may pass over me. And since thou art pleased to try me to the uttermost, I humbly beseech thee give me now in this great instant, full patience, proportionable comfort, and a heart ready to dye for thy honour, the Kings hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and this Churches preservation. And my zeal to these (far from Arrogancy be it spoken) is all the sin (human frailties excepted, and all incidents thereto) which is yet known to me in this particular for which I now come to suffer; I say in this particular of Treason; but otherwise my sins are many and great: Lord pardon them all, and those especially (what ever they are) which have drawn down this present judgment upon me: and when thou hast given me strength to bear it, do with me as seems best in thine own eyes: and carry me through death that I may look upon it in what visage soever it shall appear to me,</hi> Amen. <hi>And that there may be a stop of this issue of blood, in this more than miserable Kingdom,</hi> (I shall desire that I may pray for the People too, as well as for my self) <hi>O Lord, I beseech thee, give grace of repentance to all Blood-thirsty People; but if they will not repent, O Lord confound all their devices, defeat and frustrate all their designs and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours upon them, which are or shall be contrary to the Glory of thy great Name, the truth and sincerity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the establishment of the King and his posterity after him in their just rights and Priviledges, the honour and conservation of Parliaments in their just power, the preservation of this poor Church in her truth, peace, and
<pb facs="tcp:103099:187"/>
patrimony, and the settlement of this distracted and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed People under their ancient Laws, and in their native Liberties. And when thou hast done-all this in meer mercy for them, O Lord, fill their hearts with thankfulness, and with Religious dutiful obedience to thee and thy Commandments all their days: So</hi> Amen, <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> Amen, <hi>and receive my Soul into thy Bosom</hi> Amen.

Soften the most obduarte hearts with a true Christian desire of saving those mens blood, for whom Christ himself hath shed His. Or if the guilt our great sins cause this Treaty to break off in vain, Lord let the Truth clearly appear, who those men are, which under pretence of the Publick good do pursue their own private ends; that this People may be no longer so blindly miserable, as not to see, at least in this their Day, the things that belong unto their Peace. Grant this gracious God, for his sake who is our Peace it self, even Jesus Christ our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <hi>February</hi> the 20<hi>th.</hi> The Lord <hi>Macguire,</hi> an Irish Baron, was executed by the common hangman at Tyburn by command of the Members at <hi>Westminster.</hi> In the History of which execution recorded in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their own Pamphlets written then and upon that subject, the Reader may observe two Questions asked by Mr. <hi>Gibbs,</hi> one of the Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> and answered by that Lord the very instant before his death; The first was, Whether he knew of any Commission the King had granted to the Irish Rebels, for the commotion they had raised in their Country? he answered, <hi>That he never knew nor heard of any.</hi> The second was, Whether there was not some agreement made by the Irish Commissioners, before the Rebellion first brake out with the Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants of <hi>England?</hi> He answered, <hi>That to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, there was never an one in</hi> England, <hi>either Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick or Protestant, that knew of it, but one, and he was an Irish man, and a Protestant, and he came to
<pb facs="tcp:103099:190"/>
the knowledg of it but by chance, not at he was an actor in it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Out of which, and out of that delivered by the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> on the Scaffold immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before his death, the World may evidently see His Majestly irrefragably cleared, by two acts of the Rebels own cruelty, from two of the most scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous aspersions, by which the malice of these forg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rebels hath from time to time endeavcured to make His sacred Majesty odious to His People. <hi>Salutem ex inimicis nostris,</hi> may the King well say, seeing his Enemies actions turned to his justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, quite contrary to their intendments. The first was <hi>an imagined inclination in His Majesty to Popery</hi>; The second, <hi>a pretended commissionating of the Irish Rebellion.</hi> In the first, the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi> In this, the Lord <hi>Macguire,</hi> both at their very dying hours, have rendred His Majesty as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, as the Rebels intended him odious. I say innocent, because we know the worst of Rebels cannot but credit those Persons especially testifying at such time when they were immediately after to give an account of all their actions to the knower of all hearts. Nor can any one believe, but the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (who was daily conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant with His Majesty in matters of Religion) must needs know the very depth of his heart therein; And the Lord <hi>Macguire</hi> (who was privy to the first motion of the Irish Rebellion) must likewise of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity have known of the Kings Commission, if any such thing had been.</p>

Treaty His Majesties Commissioners condescend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much, but those of <hi>Westminster</hi> would abate nothing of the rigour of their first unheard-of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, which was the cause the Treaty took no better effect.</p>

In this Town the Rebels did most barbarously execute 13 of His Majesties Soldiers, which his Highness Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> did soon after justly requite, <hi>(lege talionis)</hi> by hanging up a like number of theirs, which he had taken without Quarter given.</p>

they disoblige themselves from that Oath,

                     <p>Now tell me, Reader, what Tropological sence can save this jugling from flat and literal Perjury? not all the addition of their Abrogative to their Legislative power, For this is indeed to abrogate Christianity as well as Loyalty out of the World: To give leave to kill the Kings Person in the field, and yet to cheat men into a conceipt of preserving His Majesty in <hi>William Lenthal's</hi> Chair: To make the World believe they are Protestants, when they permit and authorize an illiterate Assembly of Non-Divines to discountenance the 39 Articles, dispute about expunging the fifth Article of the Apostles Creed: To antiquate the Lords Prayer out of the Church Service, and turn out the long-setled Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Common-Prayer out of the Church, to give way to a long winded extemporary non-sence in the room thereof.</p>

                        <hi>March</hi> the 23<hi>d.
