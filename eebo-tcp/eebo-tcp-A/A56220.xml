            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ON the 7th. day of this inſtant <hi>May</hi> Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> walking to <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> (where he had not been ſix daies before,) meeting with ſome old <hi>ſecured</hi> and <hi>ſecluded Members</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> ſummoned by King <hi>Charles</hi> his Writ and Authority, for theſe only ends (expreſſed in all writs of Summons to the Lords, and of Elections iſſued to Sheriffs of Counties for electing Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes of Parliament, and in the Indentures themſelves by which they were retorned Members;) <hi>To confer and treat of certain, great and arduous affairs, concerning the defence of the King Kingdom, and Church of</hi> England, <hi>and to do and conſent to thoſe things which ſhall happen to be therein ordained by Common counſel, (of the King, Lords, and Commons,) touching</hi> the aforeſaid buſineſſes: which Parliament began at <hi>Weſtminster</hi> the third day of <hi>November,</hi> 1640.

to them to ſit in ſafety, for improving the preſent opportunity for ſetling and ſecuring the peace and freedom of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; praying for the preſence and bleſsing of God upon their endeavours; who after they had ſate many years in performance of the truſt repoſed in them by the people, and being in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of that Duty aſſembled in Parliament at</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>upon the</hi> 20<hi>th. day of</hi> April 1653. <hi>were then interrupted and forced out of the Houſe from that time untill this very day</hi>: Of which force they ſeeme in their <hi>Declaration unfeinedly to repent,</hi> by an <hi>actual reſtitution</hi> of the Members formerly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thence, much more then of that <note n="*" place="margin">See the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix to my Speech in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and the 2d. part to the Hiſtory of Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> greater and more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent force of whole Regiments of Horſe and Foot drawn up to the houſe it ſelf in a violent manner, where they <hi>ſeiſed, ſecured</hi> Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> with above forty, and ſecluded, forced away above 2 hundred <hi>Members more of the Commons Houſe,</hi> only for the faithfull diſcharge of their Truſts and Duties therein, according to their Oaths, Proteſtations, Vows, Covenants, Conſciences; wherin moſt think <hi>they firſt turned out of the way, by wandring into other wayes from righteous &amp; equal paths</hi>; which <hi>Members</hi> though they do not particularly invite to ſit again, yet they having proved no breach of truſt againſt them, do not in the leaſt meaſure intimate, that they would forcibly ſeclude them from ſitting if that Parliament ſhould be publickly voted ſtill in being by vertue of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 17 <hi>Caroli c.</hi> 7. as they in their <hi>Counſel of the Army</hi> have actually reſolved, by their <hi>invitation</hi> of the Members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to ſit again, as Mr. <hi>P.</hi> &amp; thoſe Members who ſhewed it to him conceived upon their peruſal thereof. Mr. P. being after informed, that the <hi>Old Speaker</hi> and ſundry Members of the long Parliament were then met in the painted <hi>Chamber</hi> to conſult together in order to their meeting again in the Houſe, was moved to go thither to them, which he refuſed, becauſe it was no place where the <hi>Houſe of Commons ever uſed</hi> to meet or ſit as an <hi>Houſe,</hi> but only as a <hi>Committe</hi> upon conferences with the Lords: Soon after Mr. <hi>P.</hi> heard by ſome Members and others, that the <hi>old Speaker</hi> and about
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52462:3"/>
forty Members more, with the <hi>Mace</hi> carried before them, were gon from the <hi>Lords</hi> Houſe into the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> &amp; there ſate as an <hi>Houſe</hi> by vertue of the Statute and their old Elections by the Kings Writs; Vpon which there being then above 30 of the old ſecluded Members in <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1648. in the <hi>Hall</hi>; they did think fit and agree, that to avoid Tumult, about 12. or 14. of them, in the name of the reſt, if freely admitted without any ſecluſion, or engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; in a friendly manner, ſhould deſire to know of them, <hi>Upon what account they did now ſit there thus ſodainly and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly, without giving any convenient notice or ſummons to all the reſt of the Members to ſit with them?</hi> If only by vertue of the Act of 17 <hi>Caroli</hi> ch. 7. thus penned. <hi>Be it enacted and declared by the King our Soveraign Lord, with the Aſſent of the Lords &amp; Commons, That this preſent Parl. now aſſembled ſhall not be diſſolved, unleſs it be by Act of Parliament to be paſſed for that purpoſe; Nor ſhall any time or times during the continuance thereof, be prorogued or adjourned, unleſs it be by Act of Parliament, to be likewiſe paſſed for that purpoſe.

And that all and every thing or things whatſoever done or to be done, for the adjournment proroguing or diſſolving of this preſent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſhall be utterly void and of none effect:</hi> Then they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſend for the reſt of the Members walking in the <hi>Hall</hi> to come in unto them: and to move, that all ſurviving Members of this Parliament, might by joynt conſent parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly be ſent to, and invited to meet and ſit in the Houſe at a convenient day, before any Vote or Order paſſed by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then ſitting, thus ſodainly convened without any notice (which would be interpreted rather a ſurprize, and un-Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary practice, both by the abſent Members and the whole Nation, than any obliging Parliamentary Vote or Order of the Houſe) and more diſcontent than invite or u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite

the abſent unſummoned Members, than unite them, making the rent greater than before. And when they were there aſſembled, that in the firſt place they might freely &amp; fully debate this Queſtion, (wherein there were different O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions between the Members themſelves, and other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Lawyers;) <hi>Whether this Parliament was not actually diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the late Kings forcible death,</hi> (which is clearly Mr. <hi>P.</hi> his opinion formerly publiſhed) Or, <hi>Whether it was not ſtill in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by vertue of this Act, notwithſtanding the Kings death, or any other thing or things done already by the Army-Officers or others for the adjourning, proroguing or diſſolving thereof?</hi> If it ſhould upon ſuch debate be Voted by the <hi>Majority of the Houſe to be really and legally diſſolved</hi>; they held it their duties and theirs now ſitting, to acquieſce therein, and act no farther as a Parl. But if voted <hi>ſtill in being,</hi> they all held it their duty, to ſit and joyn their beſt Counſels and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſettle the <hi>Government, Peace, Safety of our distrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Church and Nations,</hi> now more ſhaken, unſetled, endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered in their apprehenſions than ever, and would ſubmit their private contrary Opinions in this (as in all other Votes) to the over-ruling Judgement of the whole Houſe; as the only hopefull way to revive the antient Conſtitution, <hi>Rights, Privileges</hi> of Parliament; and reſettle us upon laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foundations of Peace and Proſperity.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe Reſolutions alone, &amp; none other, which Mr. <hi>P.</hi> intended to propoſe to thoſe then ſitting, he went to the <hi>Lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> door of the <hi>Commons Houſe,</hi> accompanied with Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> Mr. <hi>Arthur Anneſley,</hi> Sir <hi>John Evelyn,</hi> Mr. <hi>Th.

refuſed to acquaint them.

Whereupon he ſpake to 4 or 5 Members there met, to go along with him into the Houſe, and if they were freely admitted, to give notice of it to the reſt to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after if they pleaſed: Some of them were unwilling to go being formerly repulſed, thinking it better to make a Narrative of their former forcible ſecluſion on Saturday, and to ſignifie it by a Letter directed to the Speaker, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed with their names, which Mr <hi>P.</hi> conceived ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, ſince the Door now ſtood feeely open to all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Guards to ſeclude any, and that, as he apprehended, in purſute of Major General <hi>Lamberts</hi> promiſe to Mr. <hi>Knightly: And it would be idle to complain of that force by Letter, wherewith they might now acquaint thoſe then ſitting by their own mouthes, if there were cauſe.</hi> Vpon

To which he anſwered, <hi>That indeed was once their Good Old Cauſe; but now it was not ſo, for ſince they had purſued another Cauſe:</hi> Mr. <hi>P.</hi> replyed, that then they were <hi>real Back-ſliders therein,</hi> and their <hi>Cauſe</hi> neither <hi>old</hi> nor <hi>good,</hi> but <hi>bad, new</hi> and deſtructive to the former <hi>old one.</hi> In concluſion Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> preſſed them to tell him their names, which he deſired to know; They anſwered they would not tell him: He then told them, <hi>That certainly their</hi> Good Old Cauſe <hi>was in their own Judgements and Conſciences very bad, ſince they durst not own it by name</hi>: They anſwered, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Anneſly <hi>the laſt day when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to tell their names, as they do now, had inquired out ſome of them, from whom he might learn them.</hi> In concluſion when he could not prevayl, he told them, <hi>they declared themſelves and thoſe now ſiting ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Cowards,, and their magnified</hi> Good Old Cauſe <hi>to be very bad, ſince they were afraid of one ſingle perſon without Arms, when as they were a whole Army of armed men, and had above</hi> 40 <hi>voyces to his one, yet were afraid to admit him in, for fear he alone ſhould blow them all up with the breath of his mouth, and goodneſs of his cauſe.</hi> And ſo departing, he met Mr. <hi>Prydeaux</hi> in the <hi>Lobby,</hi> and deſired him to acquaint thoſe within, <hi>that he was forcibly kept out of the Houſe by the Souldiers, who beſet the paſſages to keep out what Members they pleaſed</hi>; Then returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into the Hall, a ſecluded Member he there met preſſing him to know what paſſed in the <hi>Lobby:</hi> he related the ſum of what was done and ſaid, which divers preſſed about him to hear, and ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers among others; who when he had ended his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſaid, <hi>he was an honeſt Gentleman, and had ſpoken nothing but truth and reaſon.</hi> After which meeting with Colonel <hi>Oky</hi> in the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52462:10"/>
Hall (who came over to tranſport him from <hi>Jerſy</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> they had ſome diſcourſe touching his forcible ſecluſion, and the great ſcandal and ill conſequences of it; which divers preſſing to hear, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> went out of the Hall to avoid Company, and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Member who drew up the Letter to the Speaker, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed and ſigned the fair Copy, and ſo departed to <hi>Lincolns Inne</hi> without any Company.</p>
            <p>This being an Exact <hi>Narration</hi> of the <hi>truth, ſubſtance</hi> of what paſſed between Mr. <hi>P.</hi> the <hi>Army Officers,</hi> and thoſe now fitting, on the 7th. and 9th. of this inſtant <hi>May,</hi> both in the <hi>Lobby, Houſe,</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> being ſince neceſsitated to publiſh it, to prevent and rectifie the various miſreports thereof. He ſhall now relate, (as a <hi>Corollary</hi> thereunto) the true and only reaſons then inducing him (after earneſt Prayer to God for direction and protection in this Grand Affair) to preſs the admiſſion of himſelf and other Members into the Houſe, to correct the manifold contradictory cenſures of what he then did and ſpoke.</p>
            <p>Some have been ſtaggared and amazed at it, as if he were now turned an Apoſtate from his former principles, acting both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Judgement and Conſcience, to cry up, and make himſelf a Member of that old Parliament, which he publickly printed to be diſſolved above ten years ſince, by the Kings death; Others have cenſured it for a raſh, fooliſh, and deſperate attempt.</p>
            <p>A third ſort condemn it as a ſeditious, tumultuous if not treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Action, prejudicial to the publick peace and ſettlement, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſevere exemplary puniſhments.</p>
            <p>A fourth Claſſis doome it, as a ſcandalous Act, diſhonorable, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to our Religion.</p>
            <p>A fifth ſort cry it up, as a moſt neceſſary, heroick, rational, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Action, deſerving everlaſting honor, prayſe, thanks from the whole Engliſh Nation, and a neceſſary incumbent duty as a Member of the old Parliament, (though legally diſſolved) being pretentionally now revived againſt Law, Truth, by thoſe very Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Officers, who ſix years paſt <hi>ipſo facto</hi> diſſolved, and declared it to be diſſolved; yea have held many <hi>new Mock-Parliaments</hi> of their own modelling ſince, all proving abortive, by forcible ruptures as the long Parliament did.</p>
            <p>It is not in Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> power to reconcile or controll theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory cenſures; neither was he ever yet ſo fooliſh or vain-glorious, as to be any wayes moved with the cenſures, opinions, or applauſes of other men; nor ſo ambitious, covetous, as to purſue
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52462:10"/>
any private intereſt of honor, profit, revenge, &amp;c. under the notion of publick Liberty, Law, Reformation as many have done; nor ſo Sycophantical as to connive at others deſtructive exorbitances, guilded over with ſpecious Titles; this being his conſtant rule, to keep <hi>a good Conſcience in all things both towards God and man,</hi> Acts 24.16. to diſcharge his publick truſt, duty towards God and his Native Country, though with the probable hazard of his life, liberty, eſtate, friends, &amp; what elſe may be precious to other men; to truſt God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone with the ſucceſs, reward of his endeavors, to let others cenſure him as they pleaſe; to fear no Mortal or power whatſoever in the diſcharge of his duty, <hi>who can but kill the Body,</hi> Mat. 10.23. (nor yet do that but by Gods permiſſion) being utterly unable to touch the Soul, but to fear him alone <hi>who can caſt both Soul and Body into Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The only ground, end, motive, inducing Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> thus ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and timely to get into the Houſe, was no wayes to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance any <hi>unparliamentary</hi> Conventicle or proceedings whatſoever, nor to own thoſe then ſitting to be the old true Commons Houſe of Parliament, whereof he was formerly a Member, as now conſtituted, much leſs to be the Parliament it ſelf then ſitting; but to diſcharge the truſt to which he was once unvoluntarily cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led without his privity or ſolicitation, by an unanimous election, a little before the laſt Treaty with the King, having refuſed many Burgesſhips, freely tendred to him with importunity, both before his election at <hi>Newport</hi> and ſince, being never ambitious of any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick preſerments, which he might have eaſily obtained, had he but modeſtly demanded, or ſignified his willingneſs to accept them. After his election againſt his will and inclination, he came not into the Houſe till the Treaty was almoſt concluded, (and that at the requeſt of divers eminent Members) only with a ſincere deſire to do that cordial ſervice for preſervation of the King, Kingdom, Church, Parliament, Laws, Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> and prevention of thoſe manifold Plots of forein-Popiſh Adverſaries, Prieſts, Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, Sectaries, ſeduced Members, Army-Officers, and Agitators, utterly to ſubvert them, which other Members overmuch or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally neglected, coldly oppoſed, or were totally ignorant of: What good ſervice he did in the Houſe during that little ſpace he continued in it, is fitter for others then himſelf to relate. How fully he then diſcovered to them the true original Plotters, fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that Goad Old Cauſe, now ſo much cryed up and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, how ſtrenuouſly he oppugned, how truly he predicted the dangerous conſequences of it, ſince experimentally verified beyond

That the ſole end, ſcope of this Act was not to provide againſt the diſſolution of the Parliament by the Kings natural, or violent untimely death, not then thought of, (he being in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health, likely to live many years by the courſe of nature, and to ſurvive all the ends for which this Act was made,) but to raiſe credit for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to provide monies by this Act, <hi>to prevent the untimely diſſolution, proroguing, adjourning of this Parliament by the Kings own regal power</hi>: He having prorogued, diſſolved all former Parliaments during his Reign in diſcontent, by his Regal power (not death) againſt the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons wills. 2ly. This is intituled, <hi>An Act to prevent Inconveniences which may happen by the untimely adjourning, proroguing, or diſſolving of this preſent Parliament,</hi> and the Prologue, Body of the Act, provide joyntly and ſeverally againſt all three, to wit, <hi>the untimely proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing,

or adjourning,</hi> as well as <hi>diſſolving</hi> of this Parliament. But no Parliament ever was, is, or poſſibly can be <hi>untimely prorogued,</hi> or <hi>adjourned,</hi> by the Kings death, but only by his actual Regal will and power: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diſſolving of it, intended by this Act, muſt be only an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely diſſolution by his actual will,</hi> Commiſſion, writ, and regal power, alone, by which his former Parliaments were prorogued, diſſolved againſt the Lords and Commons aſſents, not by his death, whether natural or violent, being againſt his will, and no part of his Regal Supremacy, but only of his human frailty 3ly The <hi>Inconveniences</hi> the Commons feared would enſue by the untimely diſſolution of this Parliament, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to prevent by this Act, are thus expreſſed in the Prologue. <hi>Where as great ſums of mony must of neceſsity be ſuddainly advanced and provided for relief of his Majeſties Army, &amp; people of the Nothern parts of this Realm, and to prevent the imminent danger this Kingdome is in, and for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of other his Majeſties preſent and urgent occaſions, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo timely effected as is requiſite, without credit for rayſing the ſaid mony: which credit cannot be obtained, untiil ſuch Obstacles he first removed as are occaſioned by Fears, Jealouſies, Apprehenſions, of divers of his Majeſties Subjects, that this preſent Parliament may be adjourned, prorogued, or diſſolved,</hi> (1.) <hi>before Juſtice ſhall be executed upon Delinquents,</hi> (2ly.) <hi>publike grievances redreſſed,</hi> (3ly.) <hi>a firm peace between the two Nations of</hi> England and Scotland <hi>concluded,</hi> (4ly.) <hi>and before ſufficient proviſion be made for the repayment of the ſaid monies, ſo to be rayſed: all which the Commons in this preſent Parliament aſſembled, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving duly conſidered, do therefore humbly beſeech your moſt excellent Majeſty that it may be declared and enacted.

            <p>From all which premiſes it is apparent, That the King himſelf and both Houſes of Parliament did never intend by this Act to prevent the diſſolution of this Parliament by the Kings natural death, (the Act of God they could not prevent) nor yet by his violent beheading (which then they neither intended nor foreſaw) but by his own voluntarie Act and Royal prerogative, by which he formerly adjourned, prorogued, diſſolved Parliaments at it his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. 9<hi>ly.</hi> It is reſolved in our Law-books, That if an Act of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament refer to or confirm a thing which is not, or a thing which is utterly againſt Common law, Reaſon, Juſtice, as for a man to be a Judge or Witneſſe <hi>in his own caſe) or a thing that is miſ-recited, or repugnant, or impoſsible to be performed,</hi> there the <hi>Common-law ſhall controll and adjudge ſuch an Act to be meerly void, Plowdon</hi> f. 398, 399, 400.

But it is repugnant to Reaſon, Juſtice, Nature, the intention of the Writs of Summons, yea a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that the King ſhould treat and confer with his Parliament after his death, or the Parliament not determine by it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were it particularlie provided for by this Act, it had been void in Law, (as if this Act of Parliament had declared, <hi>That a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage between man and wife ſhall not be diſſolved by the death of either of them, but continue indiſſolvable by death,</hi> againſt Nature, experience, Scripture, <hi>Rom</hi> 7.1, 2, 3.) much more then when not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed nor intended by this Act, as the premiſes evidence.</p>

Thoſe then ſitting went in openlie like a Houſe, upon 40 daies general Summons by Writs, ſetting without Gards, ſecluding none of their Fellow-Members by force.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52462:20"/>
this, to which they are direct <hi>Antipodes</hi>; Therefore no Commons Houſe within this Act. 4ly. The Commons Houſe within this Act, was that Houſe which was then in being when this Act paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, dulie elected by the people by the Kings Writs, not the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie-Officers, and purſued the ſelf-ſame ends recited in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble, for which this Act was made and aſſented to by the King and Lords. But this New Houſe was created, conſtituted, not by the Kings writs, or peoples election, but the Armies ſwords, and conſpiracie, 7 years after this Act firſt paſſed; then diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and turned out of Doors above 6 years by the Army; and now re-inducted into it by their armed Votes and force to ſerve their ends, not to purſue thoſe mentioned in the Act, accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed many years ſince, and now becoming impoſſible. Therefore they are not ſo much as an Houſe of Commons within this Act, and the Armie-Officers and Souldiers who formerly thruſt them out, &amp; now recall them; may do well to conſider that Goſpel-Text, Gal. 2.18. <hi>If I build again the thing I deſtroyed, I make my ſelf a Tranſgreſſor, even againſt this very Law,</hi> as well as the law of God, and other laws of the Land.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. If they are not ſo much as a Commons Houſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, much leſs then are they the lawfull Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> in anie ſenſe within the letter or meaning of this Act, no more than ſo manie of the old Gunpowder Popiſh-Traitors, (had their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon taken ſo good effect in blowing up King <hi>Iames,</hi> the <hi>Lords</hi> whole Houſe, and majoritie of the Commons Houſe there aſſembled, as their late new Powder-plot hath done) had been the onlie law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Parliament of 3 <hi>Iac.</hi> they deſtroyed, in caſe they had entred then into the Commons Houſe with the Mace before them, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſtiled themſelves alone the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> as a right devolved unto them by Conqueſt or Succeſsion; which had they preſumed to do, no doubt the whole English Nation <note n="*" place="margin">2 Kin. 21.23, 24. c. 14 5.6, 1 1 King. 16.16 to 21.</note>would have riſen up againſt them as one man, and never have ſo far diſhonored themſelves, their Religion, or Countrie, as to own and ſubmit to thoſe Jeſuitical Romiſh-Traitors, only for deſtroying of their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>King,</hi> Lords Houſe, and Engliſh Parliament it ſelf, as the onlie true old Engliſh Parliament then <hi>re-aſſembled.</hi> The Reaſons are unanſwerable,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the whole Houſe of Commons then ſitting in its primitive ſplendor, fullneſſe, freedome, was by its own quadruple acknowledgement in it, no more but the <hi>Commons Houſe,</hi> and one Member of this Parliament, not the Parliament it ſelf; never own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52462:20"/>
owning, but profeſſedlie diſclaiming it ſelf to be the Parliament, or preſent Parliament within this Act. 2<hi>ly.</hi> Becauſe this Act was made not by the Commons alone without the King or Lords con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, but by the King as their Soveraign Lord, declaring and enacting, and the Lords and Commons, as jointlie aſſenting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. 3<hi>ly.</hi> Becauſe it is moſt abſurd to conceive, that the King and Lords by paſſing this Act, to continue this Parliament as then conſtituted, till diſſolved by Act of Parliament, did <note n="*" place="margin">See Exact Col. p. 131, 148, 317 to 314.</note> ever intend to ſeclude themſelves quite out of it, or to make the Commons Houſe alone an abſolute independent Parliament, without both or either of them; though five times ſpeciallie providing by name for their Parliamentarie intereſts; Or that they or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons intended to make each of themſelves a diſtinct Parliament without the other, and ſo to erect three New Parliaments at once, by providing againſt the untimelie proroguing, adjourning, or diſſolving of one; The King and Lords both jointlie and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie having the ſelf-ſame Arguments from this Act to prove each of them a ſeveral or joint Parliament without the Commons, by the Commons own intention in paſsing this law, as the Commons have to juſtifie themſelves to be a Parliament, now they have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and engaged againſt them both, and will admit of neither as Members of their Parliament, when as this verie Act preciſelie prohibits the King to diſſolve, prorogue, or adjourn the Parliament, or either Houſe therof; or the Lords to prorogue or adjourn, much leſs diſſolve the Commons Houſe, or the Commons to prorogue or adjourn, much leſſe diſſolve the Lords Houſe, declaring and enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That at any time or times during the continuance of this Parliament,</hi> the <hi>Lords</hi> Houſe ſhall not be adjourned (nor yet the Commons Houſe) but onlie by their own reſpective Orders, and <hi>by themſelves alone,</hi> declaring, enacting everie thing and things whatſoever done, <hi>or to be done</hi> to the contrarie, <hi>to be utterly void and of none effect.</hi> 4<hi>ly.</hi> Becauſe this Act both in the Title, prologue and <hi>body,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents onlie the <hi>untimely proroguing, adjourning, and diſſolving of this preſent Parliament at any time or times during the continuance of it, but by Act of Parliament or themſelves,</hi> ſtiling it 8. ſeveral times, <hi>this preſent Parliament,</hi> and giving it no other Title, yea it preciſelie deſcribes it to be, a <hi>Parliament onlie of King, Lords, and Commons,</hi> as it was when this Act was made, and ſo to continue till its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. But the Parliament now ſitting, was not <hi>this preſent Parliament,</hi> being not then known, heard of, nor imagined ever to ſtart up in After-ages, by any who made or conſented to

this Law, it being created onlie by the Armie 7 years after this Act, and now revived full 18 years after it, without anie King or Houſe of Lords, and proteſting, engaging againſt them both as no Members of it. Neither can they purſue any one of thoſe ends for which this Parliament was continued. Therefore they are doubtleſſe beyond diſpute, no Parliament at all within the words or intention thereof, their own Conſciences, Reaſon being Judges, (whatever they pretend) nor yet by their own Republican principles, <hi>a free and equal Repreſentative of the people.</hi>

At my firſt anſwer no man ſtood by me, but all men forſook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge: Notwithſtanding the Lord ſtood by me and strengthned me, that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the Lyon, And the Lord ſhall deliver me from every evil work, and will preſerve me to his heavenly KINGDOM; to whom bee glorie for ever and ever, Amen.</hi>
