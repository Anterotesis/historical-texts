            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THAT I am permitted to lay this TRAGEDY at your Lordship's Feet, transports me more then the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Success on the Stage could have done. I confess the Scenes are very imperfect, yet as First-fruits I hope they may prove a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Offering. 'Tis by your influence that Poetry flourishes in our Age; and therefore no wonder if Poets throng to make you their Acknowledgements, and Dedicate their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours at your Shrine. By the Excellencies of your Lordships Mind they form their best <hi>Heroes,</hi> and oblige the World with Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of Men both Great and Courteous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:51261:3"/>Whilst other Judges (like Usurpers in Fame) are jealous of every new Pretender to the Bays, and labour to Crush 'em in their first Appearance; your Lordship as the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Monarch of Wit, sits secure in your Native Right, assur'd that where-ever they gather their Lawrels, those on your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Brow are Sacred and Inviolable. Such is the Accuracy of your Judgment in Poetry, so Correct your Performances when you condescend to Write, that the most perfect Authors must be gratefull for your Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation: yet so vast is your Candour, as to afford Protection to the Essays of even my weak Fancy. But though I am the least of those that are blest with your Lordships Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, yet I am above 'em all Happy in This, that I stand the greatest Instance of your Goodnesse.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Wou'd not have the Reader surpriz'd to find this <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy</hi> bear some Resemblance with the passages of the Fourth Book of the <hi>AEneids,</hi> for I had begun and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht it under the Names of <hi>Dido</hi> and <hi>AEneas</hi>; but was wrought by advice of some Friends, to Transform it to the Dress it now wears. They told me it wou'd ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear Arrogant to attempt any Characters that had been written by the Incomparable <hi>Virgil</hi>; and therefore (though sensible enough of what I should lose by the Change) I chose to suffer any Inconvenience rather then be guilty of a breach of Modesty. The Man of Wit is seldome a Friend to a young Writer; but no such Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Foe to a New Authour as your Man of Noise: who is still the more to be fear'd the less he is able to judge: as 'tis observ'd when a Criminal falls into the Hands of the <hi>Rabble,</hi> those are the most forward to worry him that least understand his Offence. Our loudest <hi>Critiques</hi> are generally Pleas'd or Displeas'd with what is least Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial in a Play, or perhaps not so much as a Part of it; for sometimes <hi>Five good Acts</hi> have not been able to make amends for <hi>One ill Dance.</hi> If the Sense of the Lines prove too close and weighty for their <hi>Tender Intellects,</hi> they hold themselves affronted, and the Poet must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer it at his Peril: but if he commit the Capital crime of inserting <hi>Learning</hi> into his Play, it were convenient

that his Will were made, and some Brother of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty immediately set to work on his <hi>Epitaph.</hi> Sir <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> got rid of the <hi>Silk-weavers</hi> with <hi>much Contusion,</hi> and <hi>Cinna</hi> in <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> scap't with some Rubbs, and being hoist on a Cowl-staff; but to be <hi>

This one would think sufficient to reclaim 'em, but expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience shews us that Poetry is such a stubborn sort of Fanaticism, as is never to be rooted out by Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

            <head>PROLOGUE.</head>
            <l>Y'ave met us in defiance of the Weather:</l>
            <l>How has our Magick Conjur'd ye together?</l>
            <l>'Twas a New Play, there doubtless lay the Charm</l>
            <l>That drew to our forsaken Hive this Swarm.</l>
            <l>To sooth your Humour more what could we doe?</l>
            <l>The Play to Night is New, the Poet too.</l>
            <l>He, though an early Trespasser in Rhime,</l>
            <l>Ne'r Climb'd the Stage before, and judg'd this Time</l>
            <l>For his first Venture safest, when the Road</l>
            <l>Was clear, the Pirate Wits disperst abroad:</l>
            <l>He hop't whilst you to th' Countrey were withdrawn,</l>
            <l>T' have found an easie Iury of the Town;</l>
            <l>But is surpriz'd to see an awefull Pit</l>
            <l>Met to Arraign him by the Laws of Wit;</l>
            <l>Laws ne'r perform'd by Mortal Writer yet.</l>
            <l>Witches and Spells the former Age believ'd,</l>
            <l>And as Authentick on the Stage receiv'd:</l>
            <l>Our Poet fears they'l hardly pass with you,</l>
            <l>Who no Charms but in Beauty will allow!</l>
            <l>Yet since such Lovers, Knaves, and Fools, have been</l>
            <l>Shewn on the Stage, as elsewhere ne'r were seen,</l>
            <l>Why shou'd his Hagg's forc't Characters appear?</l>
            <l>'Cause your nice Reason doubts if Witches are!</l>
            <l>He with a trembling Hand their <hi>Jargons</hi> wrote</l>
            <l>The Entertainment of his Mid-night Thought:</l>
            <l>Meanwhile his Fancy, like a tender Bride,</l>
            <l>With th' Exercise lay Pleas'd and terrifi'd.</l>
            <l>With ease his Beldames Tempests Raise and Lay,</l>
            <l>But cou'd contrive no Spell to save the Play.</l>
            <l>Their Art keeps Fiends in awe, and makes 'em Civil,</l>
            <l>But <hi>Critiques</hi> spight of Fate will play the Devil.</l>

            <stage>By <hi>Ragusa</hi> rising from under the Stage.</stage>
            <l>HO, ho! once more to th' hated Light I come</l>
            <l>To visit ye, and learn the Poet's Doom;</l>
            <l>E're I cou'd see the Fortune of his Play,</l>
            <l>He broke my Charms and hurri'd me away.</l>
            <l>The Critiques think I have usurpt their Right,</l>
            <l>And all the mischief I have wrought to Night</l>
            <l>Encroachment on their proper Province, Spight.</l>
            <l>I know you do by long Prescription claim</l>
            <l>A Priviledge to Censure, Rail and Dam;</l>
            <l>You pay for Railing, on your Charges flout,</l>
            <l>And 'tis but just you take your Pen'orths out.</l>
            <l>Hard Fate of Poets! — but (to make't appear</l>
            <l>Witches then Critiques more obliging are,)</l>
            <l>Ill teach 'em the sure way to Libertie—</l>
            <l>Let 'em henceforth each others Vouchers be;</l>
            <l>For they are now so large a Party grown</l>
            <l>As cou'd with Number bear the Critiques down.</l>
            <l>Then on our Stage, th' Adventurers in Wit</l>
            <l>Shall Trade secure,</l>
            <l>And Triumph o're the <hi>Hogons</hi> of the Pit.</l>
