            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A TREATISE OF Humane Reaſon.</head>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing reſolv'd, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the duty of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry private Perſon, to make a ſearch into the nature and quality of my Religion; and according to my intereſt in Humane Society, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the effects of that ſearch
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53118:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to others, if I ſhall believe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for them: I am in the firſt place to conſider of the choice of ſome Guide, for ſo long and ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a journey, where I ſhall ſometimes meet with no tract or Path at all, and ſometimes with ſo many, and thoſe ſo contrary in the appearance of their firſt entry, that the variety will confound me more then the want; eſpecially there being ſo many miſts caſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me by the errours and deceits of others, that one had great need of a better Eye-ſight than is left us by the fall of our firſt Fore-father. And this conſideration after a long and Serious debate thereof, brings no other Guide to me but my own <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which if it take ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections as it ought and may do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſets forth, and purſue thoſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53118:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
directions with care and conſtancy, though it may poſſibly lead me into errours, yet wil bring me at laſt even through them, to the propoſ'd end of my journey, which is <hi>Happineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not ignorant of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Enemies I muſt meet with in this doctrine, but am fortified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them with the thought that they who diſpute moſt againſt the power and priviledges of Humane reaſon, do it becauſe their own Reaſon perſwades them to that belief; and ſo whether the Victory be o'mine, or o'their ſide, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually defeated. They ſeek to terrifie us with the example of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellent Wits, who, they ſay, by following this <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> (for ſo they call the onely <hi>North-Star</hi> which God has given us for the right Steering of our courſe) have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53118:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fallen into wild and ridiculous O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, and encreaſed the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of Hereſies to ſo vaſt a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: But truly theſe men either followed not their own reaſon, but made it follow their will, or hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winkt it firſt by intereſts and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, and then bad it ſhew them the way; or were wanting in thoſe neceſſary diligences which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for ſo doubtful and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a paſſage: Or if, without the commiſſion of any of theſe faults, the weakneſs of their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing has deceiv'd them, the error is neither hurtful to themſelves, nor would be to others, if this doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of governing our ſelves from within, and not by example, were eſtabliſht. Whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſide, the ſubmitting our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Authority, or any thing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53118:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
elſe whatſoever, gives univerſality and perpetuity to every error.</p>
            <p>They fall naturally from hence into the large common-place of the frailty, uncertainty and diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our underſtanding to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and celeſtial notions, and are eloquent herein with much of truth. For when we ſay that every mans Soul hath in it ſelf as much light as is requiſite for our travel towards Heaven, we do not therefore aſſume, that it is as clear as thoſe ſpirits which are confeſſed to be all a Flame. And for the unaptneſs of it to receive the impreſſion of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual truths; though the <hi>what</hi> and the <hi>How</hi> of religious Myſteries be out of ſight, yet that they are ſuch, is ſufficiently viſible. Eſpecially if we uſe thoſe helps which God has prepared for us to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53118:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and thoſe our Reaſon will dict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate to her ſelf that ſhe is to uſe. The ordinary ſaying of <hi>Democritus,</hi> that <hi>Truth lyes in the bottom of a deep Well,</hi> is very applicable to this matter: that is, that we muſt ſeek it in the center and heart of our ſelves, and not look up into Heaven firſt and immediately for it; becauſe by this meanes we ſhall ſee Heaven in the bottom of the Well, though we could not the Well in the top of Heaven.</p>
            <p>But the chief and moſt Tragicall argument againſt us is, that the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of this Liberty to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular mens diſcourſes, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get as many religions as there are ſeveral perſons; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly draw after it, diſorder and confuſion, as is inconſiſtent not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the quiet, but the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53118:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Humane Society. This is a weighty and grievous accuſation, and if our Reaſon be convinced of ſo harmful a Madneſs, it will be found neceſſary to keep it chain'd and fetter'd, and as much in the dark as may be. But I hope it will acquit it ſelf. Who knows not that the Philoſophy of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients ſeperated it ſelf into ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry parties; the Pythagorians, the Peripateticks, the Stoicks, the Scepticks, the Academicks (and theſe of three ſorts) the Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the Cynicks, with many others; and theſe differ'd not in ſlight and verbal controverſies, but in the laſt ends of humane actions, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of good and evil, nay of God himſelf; whether man worked free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or were compelled by an inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table neceſſity; whether the ſoul
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53118:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were ſubject to Corruption, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material and immortal? Whether the World had a beginning, or had endured from all eternity? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Gods took upon them the Government of things below, or ſate as idle themſelves in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as their Images were here on Earth? with divers other Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of equal conſequence. Theſe opinions divided the Philoſophers, and the Philoſophers the People; nor were there fewer Sects in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> than are now in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> or <hi>London.</hi> And yet this variety of Opinion neither begat any Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War in <hi>Greece,</hi> neither did the Peripateticks (when both by the ſtrength of their Arguments and their Emperour, that Party was become the greateſt) ſet up any Inquiſition, or High Commiſſion or Committee
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53118:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
againſt the reſt; but every man enjoyed his Opinion with more ſafety and freedom, than either his Goods or Wife. The ſame like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe happened in the Religions of the Ancients; for though ſeveral Cities profeſs'd the worſhip of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Deities, yet we read not of any War which hath ſprung from that diverſity. The Poets have made the Gods enter into factions and quarrels for Commonwealths, but Commonwealths never did the ſame for their Gods. This quiet and happineſs, which (to the ſhame and ſcandal of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Name) was enjoyed four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years among the Heathen, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo long and ſo uninterupted, becauſe every Man, following the rules of his own Judgment, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Liberty to others, which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53118:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he found ſo neceſſary for himſelf. And even the Stoicks themſelves, who enſlaved the Will, durſt never attempt this violence to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
            <p>From whence then ſhall we ſay it proceeds, that ſince the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation open'd a way to this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Conſcience, ſo much Blood and Confuſion, and almoſt Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, has followed in all thoſe Countries which admitted it. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, France,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> are ſufficient witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this; and I could wiſh that miſerable <hi>England</hi> had not been added to the number of theſe ſad Examples. But certainly, ſince this Liberty has been ſo many Ages ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, without drawing after it thoſe Inconveniencies which we now ſo juſtly complain of, they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53118:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
muſt be attributed either wholly to ſome other cauſe, or to the conjunction of ſome other Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to it, which have changed the nature and condition thereof: And that (having examined all particulars which touch upon this matter) I can find to be no other, than the ſtrange and uncharitable Pride of thoſe men, who having with juſt cauſe vindicated their own Reaſon from the tyranny of unneceſſary bonds, endeavour ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs to lay them upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ſo that not the uſe of ſuch Liberty, but the appropriating of it to our ſelves only, is the true, and, I think, the ſole fountain of theſe Diſorders: for there cannot certainly in the World be found out, ſo mild and ſo peaceable a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as that which permits a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53118:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
difference in Beliefs; for what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion can any man take to begin a quarrel, when both he himſelf is ſuffered quietly to enjoy his own Opinion, and his own opinion is this, that he ought to ſuffer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to do the ſame. But if once men entertain an imagination, that every thing is wicked and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which complies not with their own ſenſe, and that in this vaſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of probabilities (which is in all kind of diſquiſitions, but eſpecially thoſe of Religion, they being moſt obſcure and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonſtrable) there is none can lead one to ſalvation; but the path wherein he treads himſelf, we may ſee the evident and neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of eternal troubles and confuſions. For not only publick Charity will perſwade us to force
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53118:8"/>
Men to that wherein conſiſts their everlaſting happineſs or calamity, if by no other means we can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce men to it (as without injury we bind the hands of a man that would kill himſelf) but alſo our private intereſt, and that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar care, which every man owes to his own Poſterity, which, without ſuppreſſion of all Hereſies, muſt run the hazard of eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, obliges us, by all means, to endeavour the extirpation of thoſe weeds out of the fields of our Neighbours, which would elſe ſo quickly overgrow our own: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if we had either more of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to others, to believe ſome Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours (the inſeparable Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Humane Nature) ought not to exclude men from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the preſent Church, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53118:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the hope of the future; or leſs of ſelf-flattery to think, that all men grope in the dark that light not their Candle at ours, we could not be ſo cruel in perſecution of thoſe faults, to which God himſelf is ſo merciful, and from which we our ſelves are not exempt. I ſhall therefore conclude this Argument with a confident aſſertion, That all the miſeries which have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the variety of Opinions ſince the Reformation, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded entirely from theſe two miſtakes, The tying <hi>infallibility</hi> to whatſoever we think Truth, and <hi>damnation</hi> to whatſoever we think Errour.</p>
            <p>Another abſurdity this Doctrine is accuſed of, that if we guide our ſelves wholly by the light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, we ſhall not only every one
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53118:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
differ from every body elſe, but every one frequently from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, changing Religion almoſt as often as our Habits, driven about perpetually by every wind, and in all probability daſht by ſome one at laſt againſt a rock; now a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> to morrow a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> next a <hi>Calviniſt;</hi> and ſo like the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> dedicate every day in the week to a ſeveral Deity. I muſt confeſs, Inconſtancy is one of the greateſt weakneſſes of the weakeſt Sex, and much leſs to be endured in Man, eſpecially in that moſt weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty affair of his whole life, the ſervice of God; but I cannot conceive, that the fear of this ſcandal obliges us to a blind and inalterable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of thoſe Laws and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which either the fate of our birth and education, or the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune

of other accidents have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged us in; but we ought to make a ſerious and long enquiry, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they agree moſt with that light of our Underſtanding, which God has infuſed into us for that end, according to the beſt extent of thoſe means, which are allowed by him to our underſtandings for this examination; and whatſoever we ſhall fix upon after this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, if it be duly made, will be upon ſuch grounds, as are not likely every day, and upon every new argument to be removed from us: for if they be, it is a great, though not an infallible ſign, that the enquiry was not made at firſt with ſo much diligence as was poſſible: And when we have once carefully ſetled our ſelves in a belief, though we happen to meet
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53118:10"/>
afterwards with ſome new and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſeen difficulties, which may ſeem to evince the contrary, yet Reaſon will not preſently adviſe us to a change, becauſe it finds it ſelf unable to unty the knot, but ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend a while and attempt again, and try a thouſand ſeveral wayes, before it deſpair and yield up it ſelf to the argument; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſtill after all this unconque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, it will then turn back and conſider whether if it alter now its judgment, it be able to ſatisfie all thoſe defences which will be made for its former opinion, and if it be overmatch'd by the doubts on both ſides, rather chuſe to continue as before, then make an innovation without advantage. This Rule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſerv'd, we ſhall not be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the inconvenience of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53118:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
changes, and yet as true it is, that we ſhall not be exempt from the poſſibility of changing at all, which is neither requiſite nor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable in this life; and if in this permutation, after all our induſtry and humility therein, it ſhall be our ill fortune to give away a truth for a falſe-hood, it will be (as killing a man againſt our will is no mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) at the worſt but an error by chance-medley, and will both find (I had almoſt ſaid claim) mercy from God, and deſerve pity from men. We know very well that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans body is in ſo perpetual a flux, that about the ſpace of ſeven years, renders him wholy and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely another corporeal ſubſtance from what he was before, the whole maſs both of accidents and matter being thruſt away by the continual
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53118:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſucceſſion of new ones: and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſoul remains ſtill the ſame, and retains all the while the ſame power and uninterrupted govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over the whole ſucceſſion, we juſtly eſteem it the ſame perſon; nay every part of him to be always ſo truely the ſame, that at any time of his life he may ſay, with theſe Eyes I ſhall behold my Saviour, though the accidents and very mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them be ſo often changed. Such an Identity as this is requiſite to a mans Faith: he may now be fully a Papiſt, and ſeven years hence fully a Proteſtant, and yet his faith ſtill remains the ſame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is all the while actuated and moved by the ſame ſoul of faith, which is conſcience; which if he preſerve inviolably, both when he was a Papiſt, and when he is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53118:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he may truly ſay, with this very faith I ſhall behold my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe this ſo exalted Guide of yours, your own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſhould direct you to forſake your Chriſtian-belief? for which the Devil do's not want ſuch plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant colours and ſpecious fallacies, as may poſſibly deceive even a good underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Before I anſwer this Objection, I deſire to know of him that makes it, what it is (for ſomething it muſt be) which he places in the ſame Eccleſiaſtical Superiority that I do reaſon? The private Spirit? what if that ſhould perſwade him to this Apoſtacy? It cannot. Not indeed if it be true; but the ſame condition will make Reaſon as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible as that; and I may as well
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53118:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
judg of the truth of the one, as you of the other.</p>
            <p>What is it then you will truſt your Soul with, in this important buſineſs? Is it the Authority of Men? Theſe verily may lead you into error, and it is not impoſſible, into the greateſt and worſt of all, which is the deſertion of Chriſt himſelf: not that this is likely to happen, neither more probable is it, that our Reaſon ſhould ſo far miſguide us. But alas! in this affair of ſo vaſt and ſo eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, what ſecurity can we aſſume, whilſt there remains a poſſibility of miſcarriage; and this poſſibility is Evident<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For let us conſider it in a Council; which if there be any aſſurance in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men, is that where moſt probably it may be found. I will
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53118:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not here reckon up the many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors which great and famous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils have fallen into themſelves, and labour'd to eſtabliſh in others, they are many and notorious. But certainly if a Council could take away the ſatisfaction of Chriſts death, and Divinity of his perſon (as was done by that great one of the <hi>Arrians</hi> which condemned <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> not without the approbation of the Pope and the whole World beſides) a Council has already done that thing, which you affirm impoſſible for it to do. For they who believed Chriſt to come into the World as an example and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern onely of Holineſs, are no more to be call'd <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> than <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamiſts</hi> or <hi>Davidiſts.</hi> If you will here contend, that even theſe men deſerted not wholy Chriſtianity, as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53118:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a man may do by the impulſion of his own private Reaſon, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly you will confeſs that they who fell ſo far into error, might as well have ſunk deeper, and exalted ſome other Prophet above Chriſt, as well as made Chriſt to be but a Prophet: and this poſſibility of Errour (even in ſo high a degree) we ſhall find in the nature and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Elements of a Council; for if any one Member of it may be a Heathen or Atheiſt in Opinion (as the lives of many Popes, and the ſpeeches of ſome, declare that they themſelves have been) why not two, not three, not more, not the Major part, that is, the whole Council? From the Sanctions of the 2 / <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd the worſhip of Images, how eaſie a ſtep was there made
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53118:14"/>
for the next; to the introduction of a full, undiſguis'd and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Idolatry, which we muſt not ſay could not, becauſe by the mercy of God it did not happen. And I verily believe, if God had not ſtirr'd up ſome perſons of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Abilities and worthy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits (for ſuch ſure they were, though not exempt from humane weakneſſes) to examine by the Rules of their own Reaſons, thoſe follies and dangerous Errours in Religion, which partly by the Intereſt, partly by the Ignorance of Men, and inſenſible advances of ill Cuſtome, were blindly embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the whole World; if theſe Men, I ſay, had not diſcover'd the paſt Errours, and by that means made their Adverſaries more cautious not to fall into any new
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53118:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ones, the world through the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Saints and Images, and the boundleſs Increaſe of vain and Superſtitious Ceremonies, would have paſt before this time, to its old and abominable worſhip of ſeveral Deities, and to a Religion overwhelm'd, if not with the ſame, yet with as many and as vain Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties. It remains therefore, that you put your Confidence rather in the Traditions of the former, than the Commands of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Church; but what thoſe were, you muſt either truſt ſome number of Men preſent, which is not without the poſſibility of being miſguided; or your own ſearch and diligence, which is to fall into that Opinion which you condemn in me. And truly they who build their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief wholly upon the Authority of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53118:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
paſt or preſent Ages, if they look upon all the Conſequences of that Opinion, are in much greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being drawn from the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, than thoſe who remit the judgment of theſe things to their own Reaſon: For ever ſince the beginning of the Chriſtian belief, there has been the Authority of above an hundred to one againſt it; and this Authority backt and ſtrengthened with the univerſal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of more than three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years before it. But on the contrary, if we weigh impartially the Motives and Arguments which every Religion can produce in its own defence; Reaſon it ſelf will find more and much greater for the Chriſtian, than it can for any other Belief whatſoever: And I am very confident, that no man
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53118:15"/>
ever from a Chriſtian, became a <hi>Turk</hi> or a <hi>Jew,</hi> becauſe his Reaſon told him that was a better Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but becauſe either fear of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment or hope of reward, or ſome other ſiniſter Cauſe, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Reaſon, that the worſt Religion in it ſelf, would be the better to him upon thoſe Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Now all thoſe Arguments by which ſome men have laboured to prove, that our <hi>Guide</hi> in ſpiritual matters ought to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> will, though they be granted for true, as I believe in ſome ſenſe they are, will not at all diſpoſſeſs Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Authority, which we have declared to be her due. For the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of a Guide I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be only this, That it cannot fail to bring us to that end, for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53118:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which we choſe to be guided by it; and if to this end there happen to be a thouſand ſeveral waies, it is a Guide no leſs infallible as to the End, if it lead us through a long, an unpleaſant and obſcure Tract, than if it conducted us by a ſhort, a delightful and an open road: for not the goodneſs of the paſſage, but certainty of not miſſing the End, is that which conſtitutes this kind of <hi>Infallibility.</hi> And truly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans particular Reaſon, if well followed (for whatſoever Guide you pitch upon, whether Scripture, Spirit, Church paſt or preſent, or any thing elſe imaginable, muſt have that condition annext, or elſe it will become unprofitable) will infallibly carry him at laſt, though perhaps through many tedious and troubleſome wandrings, to his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53118:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
eternal happineſs, if it be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (for that condition cannot be repeated too often) with conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, diligence and ſobriety.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine ſets the great gate of Heaven ſo wide open, that it will diſpleaſe thoſe men, who with an envious kind of pride think it more honour to enter in with a few at a narrow wicket. But I truly, out of an humble conſideration of my own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the general imbecillity of humane nature, ſhould ſtill lament and tremble, that the entrances to Heaven are ſo few and ſo difficult, though they were yet far more and much eaſier than this opinion makes them. There are enow obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from the frailty of our Fleſh, the ſubtilty of the Devil, the tyranny of our Paſſions, and

the perverſe crookedneſs of our corrupted Wil<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of any more from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of our intellect. Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient is the danger we run, in not performing thoſe Duties which vve underſtand aright, without making our miſ-underſtandings damnable, and condemning that as a Guilt, which is to be pitied as a misfortune. What then? ſhall vve believe <hi>Turks, Jews, Heathens, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts</hi> themſelves (if there be any ſuch) in an equal poſſibility of ſalvation, with the unerring Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian? Shall vve ſave all Beaſts of what kind ſoever, clean or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, in that myſtical Ark the Church of God? Certainly in the two contrary exceſſes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in this matter, that on the ſide of Mercy hath the appearance of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53118:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
greater ſafety; and I had rather think with <hi>Origen, That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils themſelves, by the exceſſive kindneſs of their Judge, ſhall at laſt be exempted from damnation, than that he himſelf ſhall be damn'd for that Opinion.</hi> But as to this their Objection; I believe firſt, That Reaſon it ſelf will declare to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man in the World, that he ought to adhere to the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> rather than to any other Religion whatſoever, if all things be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to him in a clear and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial manner: and this whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall deny, I dare confidently affirm, it is impoſſible for him to be a Chriſtian. But becauſe there are thouſand accidents, which hinder the greateſt part of the world from the advantages of ſo fair a propoſal, hence it comes to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53118:18"/>
paſs, that ſo ſmall a part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind hath ſubmitted to the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Chriſtian Faith: Now to condemn all thoſe Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of perſons (many millions for one that is to be ſaved) is ſo wild an uncharitableneſs, that few have been ſo barbarouſly ſevere, as to be guilty of it: and therefore thoſe whoſe Ignorance in theſe matters hath been invincible, they left to the hands of God, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring a definitive opinion either of their ſafety or perdition. Now if we conſider rightly, what Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is to be accounted invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we ſhall by this means reſtore the greateſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> part of Mankind into a hopeful and comfortable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and none even amongſt the worſt Religions, will be left to a certain ruine, but ſuch whoſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53118:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Conſciences have been neglected or forced aſide by thoſe who ought to have been guided by them; and ſuch who can have no plea againſt the rigour of their ſentence, becauſe they deſerted themſelves as well as God: And the diſobedience of Men to their own Conſcience is not only in things of practice, but alſo of belief and ſpeculation, though not in ſo evident and immediate a manner, by ſuffering themſelves to be deceived by the inſenſible operations of intereſt and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</p>
            <p>Nor does it follow from hence, that Chriſt is not the only ſource and cauſe of eternal felicity; for I acknowledge there is no other Name under heaven by which men can hope for ſalvation.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53118:19"/>
But I may very well believe withal, that there are ſecret and wonderful waies, by which God may be pleaſed to apply his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to mankind, beſides thoſe direct, open, and ordinary ones of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>Confeſſion:</hi> which I have only advanc'd briefly in this place, being a matter that will require a more ample and particular examination. Now concerning the Salvation of all ſorts of Chriſtians, except their lives diſagree from their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines (which is likewiſe a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to their Reaſons) I know not why I ſhould be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifi'd out of my Charity by any <hi>Anathema</hi> whatſoever that ſhall proceed from the mouth of Man. For I cannot ſee how any but God himſelf can certainly know
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53118:19"/>
that any man is an Heretick, ſince it is only he who can diſcern by what cloſe and unlawful means he corrupts his underſtanding, and hardens his own will to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate belief of any Errour; for without that obſtinacy there is no Hereſie, and without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſight of the whole contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a mans Thoughts and Actions, there is no knowledge of ſuch an obſtinacy: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Church declares any Opinion to be Hereſie, it is to be accepted as if the Law ſhould ſay, <hi>whoſoever kills a man is a Murtherer,</hi> which is a ſentence not abſolute but to be qualified with Circumſtances: even ſo the Church pronounces, <hi>whoſoever holds this Doctrine is an Heretick,</hi> with an evident reſervation of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53118:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſome Circumſtances in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, for no man can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the ſentence includes thoſe who never ſhall hear of it; nor no more, ſay I, thoſe, who though they hear of it, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by any means bring their Conſcience to the aſſent. For to obey in matters of belief, without being able to believe the thing commanded, is no leſs, and ſeems more a contradiction, than ſimply to obey without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a Command.</p>
            <p>Thus much briefly concerning <hi>Hereſie,</hi> which indeed is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject worthy a Treatiſe by it ſelf. But this will not ſuffice, unleſs we can alſo clear our ſelves from the imputation of <hi>Schiſme,</hi> the ordinary railing word in all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, and a ſlander which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53118:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is often fatal in making, where it falſly accuſes a ſeparation: of which they are truly guilty (the word it ſelf bearing witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them) who break the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious unity of the Chriſtian Church; but that is done not ſo much by them who differ in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, as by them who will not allow of ſuch a difference. Who knows, whether that God who liked beſt that no mens Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhould have the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, no mens Faces the ſame figures, no Hands the ſame lines, no Voices the ſame ſounds, nay not ſo much but their motions and geſtures ſhould be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable, has not likewiſe beſt pleaſed himſelf with no leſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety in the parts of Men that are immaterial, and even in the moſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53118:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
immaterial Actions of thoſe parts, which is the worſhip and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a Deity? Does God gain any thing by our devotions? does he receive hurt from one kind of worſhip, and advantage by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother? is he pleaſed with any ſmell in the ſacrifice beſides that of Obedience? and can a plain uniform, unalterable obedience be expected, without Commands of the ſame nature? Without doubt, he who gave Rules which might accept of ſo many ſeveral interpretations, when he might have made them as plain to all in one ſenſe, as they ſeem now to every man in his own, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe well contented, that they ſhall be interpreted ſeverally: and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Divines confeſs, that the ſame words of Scripture ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53118:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of a Literal, Typical, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogical ſenſe, and that all thoſe ſenſes are both true and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Holy Ghoſt, that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of unity that writ them; ſo, I ſay, the Commands of God concerning Religion are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually obeyed and fulfilled by all the various kinds of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which the Conſciences of men conceive themſelves bound to pay unto them: As well the Mud by growing hard, as the Wax by melting obeys the Sun; nor is it leſs glorified by one than by the other: nor are thoſe diverſities of powers in the Sun, but of capabilities in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that receives him: even ſo Faith is ſtill properly one, though according to the diverſe recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it, it produce not only
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53118:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diverſe but contrary effects. It is not unobſervable, that the Unity of the Church of God is compared not to the unity of one Man, but of a Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man joyned in Marriage; ſo the <hi>Church</hi> in general is one with <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſo the <hi>Church Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant</hi> with the <hi>Triumphant;</hi> and ſo every <hi>particular man</hi> with the <hi>Church militant:</hi> Now this <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> is of one part more weak, more infirm, more ignoble than the other; and the <hi>Female part</hi> in the ſimilitude, is the erring part in the Church it ſelf; and as that by the bond of <hi>Love,</hi> ſo this by the bond of <hi>Charity</hi> is to be accounted one and the ſame with the other. Can any thing be more irrational, than to ſay that a foot when it hath the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53118:22"/>
Gout, or a hand when it ſhakes with the Palſey, or a Head when it akes, ceaſes to be a part of the body? Sound or ſick, great or little, well or ill ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, are outward conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the nature of a Member; if it be informed by the ſame Soul, it requires no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to make it ſuch: Nor can you make this Soul which is required of ſuch neceſſity to give it life, to be a full and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire agreement in all points of Faith, of one member with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for then in matters of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief you make no diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt ſickneſs and death, and the leaſt indiſpoſition of health is a total Corruption. Men of the contrary Opinion (I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee) cannot chuſe but ſay here,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53118:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that in dangerous and infectious diſeaſes cut off the affected mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to ſave the reſt; and that he who in a Gangreen ſpares the Patient, is the moſt hard-hearted and unmerciful Phyſician: and truly, if Errours in belief draw ſo ill a tail af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er them as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and Damnation; if they be to be eſteemed Gangreens, as well in reſpect of their morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as their ſpreading and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious Nature; not only Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence but Charity it ſelf will put a ſword into our hands to cut them off. But alas! theſe diſeaſes are not ſo deadly, as the Phyſicians of the Soul would make them for the exalting of their own reputation; and he that would preſently lop off an arm, if the Gangreen be moving

in it, would not, I hope, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the ſame remedy, if it be but infected with an Itch: both Evils would extend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over the whole body, but the one to the perpetual deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the being, the other on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the temporary loſs of the beauty and quiet of it: and therefore we rather patiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the trouble and vexation of continual ſcratching (which is the true Metaphor for the Controverſies of Eccleſiaſtical Writers) with the loathſomneſs and deformity of ſo many ſores, than take away a Member which may poſſibly hereafter recover its former health and comelineſs, and is even now without them, of great and neceſſary uſes to the whole body.</p>

               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:53118:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>Now as for thoſe men, who accuſe us of pride and vanity for attributing ſo much to our own Reaſon, making preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſelf-flattery the fountain of this Opinion; it is a ſcandal ſo falſe and ſo ridiculous, that without much humility I ſhould diſdain to anſwer it.

For in his firſt Chapter of Religion, in the ſtate of Gods natural Empire, making e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very City the ſupream Judge in matters that belong to Gods worſhip, and to which we ought to render an entire obedience, ſaies thus: 

<q>Otherwiſe all ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd Opinions of the Nature of God, and all ridiculous Ceremonies which have been admitted by any Nations, would be ſeen at once in the ſame City, by which it would happen, that every particular perſon would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all others to <note n="*" place="margin">Contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia afficere.</note> blaſpheme, or ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverently to behave himſelf towards God; ſo that it could
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53118:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be ſaid of no man, that he worſhip'd God, becauſe no man worſhips God (that is, honours him externally) but he who does thoſe things by which he may appear to others to honour him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But methinks, if this be true, the ſeveral unappealable Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals which are ſet up by Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> in ſeveral Cities or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, are as well deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, as thoſe which are placed by us in every Mans breaſt; for ſeveral Cities ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing ſeveral kinds of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or honour, conſiſting in the Opinion not of the worſhipper or honourer himſelf, but of the witneſſes and ſpectators of the worſhip or honour; now if he ſay, that when a whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53118:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
has but one ſort of worſhip, none will be witneſſes or ſpectatours of it, but thoſe who believe it honourable; firſt, as much ſcandal from the report, as from the ſight of it; and beſides, the ſame I ſay will happen, if there were an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Religions in one City; for ſtill their Religious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations were to be made up of men of the ſame Opinions: Again, Thoſe who deny that a Commonwealth ought to enforce an unity of Worſhip upon all its Subjects, will likewiſe as much deny, that men ought to think thoſe Worſhips diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable which are not practiſed by themſelves: and if he ſay, there is no hindering of this latter, he muſt needs pardon me
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53118:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if I cannot believe that impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, which has been in the world (even in a more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous variety than is at preſent, at leaſt in our parts) for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages, and which is now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in ſome places: And if ignorant or malicious Phyſicians in this violent Feavour, did not apply new heats inſtead of Julips, they might by Writing, Diſputing, Preaching, living Charitably (which is all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) reduce the world in a ſhort time to its ancient healthful and natural temper. Laſtly (to ſtrike at the root of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument) it is falſe, that the worſhip or honour of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the opinion of others; if it did, Idolatry for four thouſand years, had been the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53118:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
beſt, nay the only Religion; and if I were now in the South Continent (where I ſuppoſe I ſhould be the only Chriſtian) I ought not to abſtain from the Chriſtian worſhip of God (no, nor to hide or diſg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap>iſe it) for fear leaſt the wonder, contempt and mockery of Infidels, ſhould on a ſudden (I know not how) convert it into ſin and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. True it is that in honour paid from Men to Men, cuſtome, conſent, and acknowledgment, makes up the buſineſs, and an honour contrary to the uſe of the place is counted an affront; as to put off the Hat would be in the Eaſt, and in the Weſt to keep it on before Princes. But the reaſon of this is, becauſe men who are not able to ſearch
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53118:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
into the hearts, muſt be govern'd in their judgment of them by the exteriour actions, and the meaſure or ſtandard of thoſe is Cuſtome; but with God it is quite otherwiſe: He beholds and judges the very thoughts of man, which are the fountains of his actions, ſo much more fully and plainly, than we do the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions themſelves, that he needs not make a ſecond, a mediate, a ſyllogiſtical judgment of the reality of mens worſhip, from the external, circumſtantial, and onely probable teſtimonies of their outward behaviours. And truly if we put the caſe amongſt Men, methinks a great <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour that calls himſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the world, ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to prove himſelf to be ſo,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53118:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from the variety of homages, tribute and worſhip, which he receives from ſeveral Nations; and no more refuſe to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd in ſeveral faſhions, than he would to be prais'd in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Languages. He would be glad perhaps to eſtabliſh the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, and make that the Speech of all Countries, but finding that deſign to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, would at leaſt pardon that diverſity which agrees and conſents in his own glory. Truly if men could caſt away ſo much paſſion, as to make but true Compariſons, they would find no more hurt from the uſe of different Ceremonies, then of different Tongues in the ſame City; and we might be as well allowed to ſerve God after the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53118:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Engliſh</hi> manner, as to ſpeak <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. As words are the images of our thoughts, ſo our thoughts are of the things themſelves: and as well may differing thoughts truly repreſent the worſhip of one God, and of his Son Chriſt Jeſus, as differing words can repreſent the ſame thought: And this the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſeems to acknowledge, which does not think ſufficient Unity in Gods Service to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, with the allowance of more than of one Language, and for preſervation of Fantaſtical Identity, teaches her Sons firſt to think, and afterwards to ſpeak they know not what. They ſay firſt, Our errour is the ſame with that of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53118:29"/>
is taxed by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> That they <hi>ſought after wiſdom,</hi> but <hi>that the world by wiſdom knew not God;</hi> that <hi>the wiſdom of the wiſe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and the underſtanding of the prudent brought to nothing;</hi> that it <hi>was made fooliſhneſs,</hi> nay it <hi>was confounded by the fooliſh things of the world.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this wiſdom, many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things are ſpoken in the beginning of that Epiſtle, and it is ſtrucken down (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was himſelf) by a greater light of Divine truth, which came from God for that very purpoſe, to amaze and confound it firſt, and then to convert it. But if we mark it well, we ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that under this name of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which is arraigned, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53118:29"/>
nay and executed here (for it is brought to nothing) is not ſignified <hi>Humane Reaſon,</hi> but that which among the <hi>Greeks</hi> at that time was falſly and blindly eſteemed to be ſo: As in the Laws againſt Magick, not that which is truly, but that which is falſly called ſo, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned. And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> names it the <hi>wiſdom of words; the enticing words of mans wiſdom;</hi> and the <hi>wiſdom after the fleſh;</hi> and the <hi>wiſdom of the Princes of the world.</hi> By which three names are plainly (methinks) deſcribed, the three great ſuborners and corrupters of Humane Reaſon (and not at all it ſelf) the deſire of Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, of Pleaſure, and Profit. By the firſt we forſake the Truth
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53118:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to make demonſtrations of our wit and eloquence: By the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to compaſs thoſe carnal and worldly pleaſures, which our own true Reaſon does not allow of, and therefore we will not allow of it: (as <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eight</hi> ſeems to have left the Pope, becauſe he refuſed to diſpence with his luſts, and to call that Matrimony, which was indeed Adultery:) And by the third, to comply with the intereſt of States and Princes, and either willingly deceiving our ſelves with the errours of our Governours, or deceiving others with a deſire to Govern them. And theſe three (at leaſt the two latter) cauſes of errour in the underſtanding, may be the Reaſon contained with truth
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53118:30"/>
in the parable concerning which is ſtrongeſt. That that which falſly ſeemed to be <hi>Humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and not that which truly is ſo, is accuſed by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> appears yet more plainly, where he ſays, that <hi>God hath choſen the things which are not, to confound the things which are:</hi> where <hi>the things which are not</hi> can ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing elſe, but the things which are eſteemed as nothing, that is neither of value in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor of power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any effects. True it is, that the beſt and trueſt <hi>Humane Reaſon</hi> could not have found out of it ſelf, that <hi>wiſdom of God in a myſtery, even that hidden wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which God ordained before the world,</hi> which is the myſtery of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> but it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53118:31"/>
it ſhould firſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by that Spirit, which can only ſearch and diſcover the deep things of God. But as ſoon as the Spirit had reveal'd it (which it did by Miracles, by fulfilling of Prophecies and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other means of power and demonſtration) even Humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was able to behold and to confeſs it; not that <hi>Grace</hi> had alter'd the Eye-ſight of Humane Reaſon, but that it had drawn the object nearer to it. And till the object was brought ſo nigh, the wiſdom of man did as ſafely not diſcern it, as it does not now the new ſtate of things, which ſhall be revealed at the Second coming. And whereas they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe againſt this the ſaying of the Apoſtle, that <hi>the Natural</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:53118:31"/>
               <hi>man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcern'd:</hi> The word <hi>Natural,</hi> I take to be a very ill tranſlation, and conceive it ought to be rendred the <hi>ſenſual man,</hi> for ſuch <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Animalis</hi> in the <hi>Latine;</hi>

               </gap> many times ſignifying the <hi>lower</hi> and <hi>ſenſitive</hi> part of the Soul, in diſtinction to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which is the <hi>upper</hi> or <hi>rational,</hi> as <hi>anima</hi> is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to <hi>Animus,</hi> and both ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to <hi>Mens.</hi> So that the meaning is, that whilſt a mans Reaſon is ſeduced by his appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and paſſions, it is an unfit Judge of Spiritual matters, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be Umpire for a peace, having joyn'd it ſelf to the Party
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53118:32"/>
of thoſe things, which are in perpetual warfare againſt the Spirit. But they ſay this <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> which we aſcribe to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is ſtrangly different from that <hi>Captivity</hi> which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſubjects it to, when he ſays, <hi>Caſting down reaſonings, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very high thing that exalts it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into Captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt.</hi> And what Captivity, ſay they, can there be, whilſt we are only guided by the motions of our own underſtanding? All which ſignifies no more, but that St. <hi>Paul</hi> relates (in vindication of his own juſt greatneſs againſt the Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of ſome that deſpiſed his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, eſpecially as weak and rude of ſpeech) how he had confuted
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53118:32"/>
thoſe perſons that oppoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by reaſonings againſt the Doctrine of Chriſt; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as their underſtandings before were enſlaved and captivated to the deſires of the ſenſual Soul (for which he calls them in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place <hi>beaſts at Epheſus</hi>) which hindred them from the obedience of Chriſt, he freed them from their cruel bondage, by caſting down all their ſtrong holds, and breaking the chains of their fallacious reaſonings, and brought them into another captivity by right of conqueſt, but ſuch an one where the yoaks are light and the burthens eaſie, that is, by true reaſon he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came and captivated their falſe ones.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:53118:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>And from this Example, I deſire thoſe who would have our Underſtandings captivated, to convince us firſt by theirs that they ought to be ſo, and not to think to enſlave our Reaſons, till they firſt overcome them: which when they have done, then they will loſe what they contend for: For by our Reaſons being gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, conquered, and enſlaved, theirs are become Guides, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours, and Maſters. So that it will appear at laſt impoſſible for humane Reaſon to loſe any thing in one place, without gaining as much in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>They who follow the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of a Viſion or Revelation extrinſecally coming into their Souls, if it happen that that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53118:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
light come from the <hi>Father of Lights,</hi> as the pillar of Fire did which led the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> they muſt needs be guided right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but if it chance to be an <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> (a flame driven about, as men commonly believe, by malicious Spirits) the Errours which it leads them into become unpardonable; for what plea can they make for mercy, ſince there is no command, nor no counſel can be alleadged for the truſting of themſelves to that Stranger, which they can neither know from whence he comes, nor whither he deſigns to go. The like happens if we obey Authority: For if that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity preſcribe truth, we have good fortune in our obedience, and meerly good fortune: but
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53118:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if it draw us into Errours, we have nothing to ſay for our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, becauſe we have nothing to alleadge for our obedience to that Authority: So <hi>Eve</hi> pleaded the Authority of the Serpent, but both were puniſhed: ſo <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> with more appearance of innocency, <hi>the Woman that thou gaveſt me for an Helper bad me eat,</hi> and accordingly I did; but to him too a Curſe is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, becauſe he believed that which was figuratively one with him (as members of the Church pretend to do the Church) rather then that which was moſt certainly and ſingly one with him, which was his own Reaſon. Thus the beſt that can be made of theſe mens O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions is, that after they have
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53118:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
blind-folded themſelves, amongſt the many doors where they may enter, there is one which will lead them to Heaven; which if they miſs, it will be asked, not why you entered not there, but why by blinding your own eyes did you put your ſelf into a greater probability of not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than of lighting upon the true paſſage. Now contrariwiſe, thoſe who commit themſelves to the guidance of their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, if they do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves <hi>wholly</hi> to it, are as ſafe on the left hand as on the right, as ſecure of happineſs in their Errours, as others are, who are otherwiſe guided, even in the Truths which they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to fall into. For there is no danger of periſhing but from
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53118:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diſobedience, without which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man may often erre, the commandement of God being not to find out truth (eſpecially every particular one) but to endeavour the finding it: He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands no more but to <hi>ſearch, and ye ſhall find,</hi> ſays he, not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular Truth, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teaches us that cannot be the interpretation: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you find or no the Truth which you ſearch for, you ſhall find the reward of ſearching, which is Happineſs: Now he that bids you ſearch, is cruel and barbarous in his mockery, if he knows you have no power or faculty ſo to ſearch as he commands you: there is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in man a natural ability of ſearching ſpiritual Truths, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53118:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that can be nothing elſe but his Underſtanding; neither to any thing elſe can the command be directed, ſince all things elſe are without us, and may ſerve for helps and directions in our ſearch, but cannot be our ſearch it ſelf: Secondly, becauſe we lay the blaſphemous accuſation of Injuſtice upon God, if he puniſh us for an Errour which we could not avoid; and all Errours are ſuch which we fall into after a full and mature ſearch for the Truth, according to the beſt means repreſented to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; ſo that as the liberty of our Will, and the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity we have of doing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, makes us ſuffer juſtly for evil Actions, ſo the poſſibility our underſtanding had to have
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53118:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diſcover'd and entertained the Truth, renders us liable to Condemnation for ill beliefs. Thirdly, We ought not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Errours in Faith to be damnable, becauſe this opinion is ſo wildly uncharitable, that it ſtrikes out ten thouſand Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions out of the Book of Life, for each ſingle Name that it leaves in it: ſo immeaſurably vaſt (if we conſider the whole World and all the Ages of it) is the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe who have lived and died in great, high, and manifeſt Errours (manifeſt I mean to us, for they were not ſo to them) above thoſe that have been ſo happy as to find and to embrace the Truth. Fourthly, We ought not to teach men, that any Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in belief overthrow our
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53118:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hopes of ſalvation, unleſs we could likewiſe give them a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of thoſe Errours which do ſo; it being confeſt that all do not, becauſe theſe muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily put all conſidering Men into a doubt, or rather deſpair of their own ſalvation: for what quiet or repoſe can our Conſcience take, whilſt vve know our ſelves to be in many Errours (the eſtate of a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellour being uncapable of an exemption from them) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that ſome Errours, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing which or how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, do exclude men from a poſſibility of entring into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Fifthly, Becauſe in this caſe we cannot know our fault, and therefore have no means of repenting of it: Now God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53118:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
men Repentance and promiſing Pardon thereupon for all ſins whatſoever, preſcribes ſuch a Phyſick as is impoſſible to be taken; for Repentance preſuppoſes knowledge of the Fault, and knowledge of a fault do's not conſiſt with an errour of the underſtanding, for we cannot apprehend the thing ſo, and yet be ſorry that we are miſtaken. Sixthly, The great probability and appearance of Truth on all ſides, even the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ones, ought to make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that God will not puniſh thoſe who erre: if that be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, which all or moſt men, or many, or the moſt wiſe, or ſome wiſe men receive for Truth: What Doctrine is there, which in the whole compaſs of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53118:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Religions may not paſs for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, and what cauſe have we to condemn the Underſtanding of any man, in a thing which he is drawn by probabilities to aſſent to. I cannot poſſibly conceive it agreeable to the goodneſs of the Divine Nature, ſo to have hidden and invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and almoſt diſguiſed the Truth from us, if he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have cenſured the miſſing of it, with ſo heavy a ſentence as that of eternal ruine; eſpecially ſeeing there is but one true Way for one hundred falſe ones, and no certain Mark ſet upon the entry of that one, to diſtinguiſh it from the others. And let this ſuffice to be ſaid upon the firſt Argument, to induce us to commit our ſelves
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53118:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wholly to our Reaſon in the ſearch of Divine and Religious Verities, which is drawn from the certainty of ſafety this way, and the great hazard of it any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As in viſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects we receive confidently, and reſt in the report of the ſight, becauſe Nature hath ordained and accommodated it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly for that purpoſe, without appeal from it either to other Sences, or to Revelations, or the Eyes of other men; and as we do the like in all other o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of the Senſe, and all other faculties of the Soul; ſo ought we as entirely and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to reſign our Belief to the dictates of our own Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53118:38"/>
in things intelligible, which are as properly and naturally the Object thereof, as things viſible are of the Eye-ſight; and we might as well ſay, we will truſt our Eyes in green, and white and black, but not in red or yellow Colours, as affirm that our Reaſon muſt guide us in the contemplation of Nature, the ſearch of Arts, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Publick Societies, and the Regulation of mens Lives as far as the bounds of Morality, but that it is not at all to be followed or obeyed in matters that concern Religion; thoſe too being intelligible Truths, yea the chief, and therefore moſt to be ſearcht, and a part of the Underſtandings object as much or rather more than any other.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53118:39"/>
Now as the credit of the ſight is not at all to be diſparaged, becauſe ſome men have the Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which paints every thing yellow, ſome look through Blew ſpectacles which repreſent all things to them under the ſame colour, and ſome through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>mediums</hi> which makes the ſtraight Staff appear crooked, ſome are ſhort-ſighted and take Men for Trees at a diſtance; ſo, I ſay, the miſtakes which Reaſon by accidental diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances leads ſome men into, is not a ſufficient Argument for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to refuſe to be guided by it.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that the Sight, though it be ſubject to ſome particular impediments, yet is generally by its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture much more certain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53118:39"/>
in the judgment of Colours, than the underſtanding can ever be made (even without acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal hinderances) in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things Spiritual. I Anſwer, That if ſuch things be the proper object of ſuch a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, we are herein to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by the dictates of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſidering whether that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty be as quick and perfect as God could make it in apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its object: neither ought we to give leſs truſt to our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in ſupernatural Truths, becauſe it is ſo much inferiour to that of Angels, than we do to our Eye-ſight in things viſible, though it be ſo far ſhort of that of Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles. Certainly they who remove the cognizance of Divine Truths out of the Court of Reaſon, take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53118:40"/>
that which moſt properly and naturally falls under its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination. For when GOD had created all things elſe, he thought the World imperfect as yet, whilſt there was nothing made that could contemplate, thank, and worſhip the Maker of it; and therefore he created Man, and this was the chief end of the production of a Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Soul, that by it they might conſider the things which they ſaw, and diſcourſe and collect out of them the things which they ſaw not, and both praiſe and love the Maker for and in them both; which is the whole ſubſtance of Religion; for the manners and kinds of doing it are accidental. So then Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion appears to be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53118:40"/>
end of Mans Creation, and therefore as if Horſes be made for burthen, they have a natural ability given them wherewith to do it; if Birds to flie, they have a faculty and wings given them for that purpoſe (becauſe where an end is Natural, the means are ſo too) ſo if Religion be the End of Man as he is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of a Rational Soul, that reaſonable Soul hath ſome pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er naturally placed in it for the exerciſe, judgment and choice of Religion, as far forth as is neceſſary to his own happineſs, that is, to the attaining the end for which he was Created.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:53118:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>In the Third place, This O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is not only moſt ſafe and moſt natural for every Man in particular, but likewiſe moſt agreeable to the good and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Humane Society: for all Wars of late Ages have been either really for Religion, or at leaſt that has been one of the chief pretences; which if it were quite taken away, it would be difficult for thoſe men who diſguiſe their Ambition with it, to draw the People into the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and uncertainties either of a Civil or Forraign War. Now if this Doctrine were generally planted in the minds of Men, both the reality and pretence of fighting for Religion were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly cancelled; and though tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent minds would then either
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53118:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
find or make ſome other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to diſturb their Neighbours, yet the ill would neither be ſo frequent nor ſo cruel as it is at preſent. For who would quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel for Religion, when this were made the main and general ground of all Religions, <hi>That every Man ought quietly to enjoy his own.</hi> True it is, that unity in Religion would produce the ſame effect; but alas! both Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Experience teaches us, that the hopes of that are vain and impoſſible; and though a <hi>State</hi> may ſometimes force all its Subjects to ſubmit to an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward uniformity in all things that concern Divine worſhip, yet they muſt know, that every publick diſturbance in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, breaks all thoſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53118:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bonds aſunder of diſſembled O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and that ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſions both beget and ripen all Diſorders.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Much might be ſpoken in this matter, but not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily here, both becauſe I have ſaid ſomething of it be fore, in anſwering this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument turn'd againſt this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion unhappily; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the manner of eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing this Liberty in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, will require a Diſcourſe entirely by it ſelf.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The laſt defence of this Cauſe, and which indeed needs not the aſſiſtance of any other, ſhall be, becauſe (though men deceive
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53118:42"/>
themſelves herein, and as it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happens, know not their own Opinions) it is impoſſible that ever any man ſhould have been, is, or can hereafter be guided by any thing elſe but his own <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as in other things, ſo alſo in matters of Religion; I ſay impoſſible, for whatſoever way we take, we ſhall find that the laſt Anchor to which our Faith holds, the laſt Element into which it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd (and therefore it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe compounded of the ſame) is onely <hi>Reaſon.</hi> For when I ask, why you believe any Myſtery of Faith? you will anſwer perhaps, Becauſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Church commands you: If I proceed and ask, Why do you believe what the preſent
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53118:43"/>
Church commands? you will ſay, Becauſe the former Church teaches the ſame. Why do you believe the former Church? Becauſe God commands you ſo to do. Why do you believe that God commands it? Becauſe you find it in the Scripture. Why do you believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to be the Word of God? Becauſe they were confirmed by Miracles. Why do Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles confirm that? Becauſe they are works which can proceed from nothing but the abſolute and immediate power of the Deity. Why ſo? Becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrary to, or above the Courſe of Nature, can be done by natural Agents; but Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are effects contrary to, or above the Courſe of Nature;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53118:43"/>
therefore they proceed from the Divine Operation. Thus you ſee Faith at laſt reſolv'd into a Syllogiſme, which is the proper work of the Underſtanding. On the other hand, if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, Why you do believe that any Miracles were done for the Confirmation of the Faith? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the great and many Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of the Truth thereof. Why do you believe thoſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies? Becauſe ſo many Perſons in ſo ſeveral times and places, with ſo ſeveral intereſts, could never agree in being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or to deceive. So that you reſt not at all in any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but diſcourſe firſt what may be ſaid for or againſt the validity of it, examine it pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually in all Circumſtances, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53118:44"/>
at laſt ſubmit to it upon ſome Syllogiſme, which is the onely Law that binds our <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Two things are to be conſidered in all Authority, before we obey or believe it; firſt, The condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and quality of the Perſons who Command or Inſtruct; and ſecondly, The true interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Commands or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. For the firſt, The Perſons in Commanding muſt have a lawful Power derived to them, either from God, Nature, or Cuſtome (which latter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the two former.) And in Inſtructing, muſt have either an abſolute infallibility, or elſe at leaſt a probability of not Erring. So that no Authority is obeyable or believeable in it ſelf without farther examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb facs="tcp:53118:44"/>
no not that of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for the ſtrength of Gods Authority depends upon that Syllogiſme, which proves that the nature of God is ſuch, that he can neither deceive nor be deceived. Now all this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination is purely and entirely the work of our Reaſon by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring a particular and an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal. Whatſoever hath ſuch Conditions is to be obeyed or believed; but ſuch Perſon or Perſons hath ſuch Conditions, therefore ſuch Perſon or Perſons are to be obeyed or believed: Neither do's our Reaſon onely preſcribe obedience and belief to us, but alſo ſearches and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes the bounds of both, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up ſome ſolid and apparent Notions, by which we know our
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53118:45"/>
               <hi>Ne plus ultra.</hi> True it is, that ſome men Obey and ſome men Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve without conſidering that they make this diſcourſe; but that is only from inadvertency, as men often move their Bodies, without any particular exerted thought of doing ſo.</p>
            <p>Thus far then Authority wholy depends upon <hi>Reaſon.</hi> And much more in the <hi>ſecond Condition,</hi> which is the interpretation of it: in which buſineſs the interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Reaſon</hi> is ſo neceſſary, that I ſhall omit either to prove or illuſtrate the Point.</p>
            <p>Now as they who enſlave themſelves to Authority, make it the rule and guide of Faith, becauſe that even the belief that Scripture is the Law of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53118:45"/>
upon it, as truly it do's (in my Opinion) upon the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Miracles; ſo I ſay, that much rather <hi>Reaſon</hi> is to be accounted that Rule and that Guide we look for, becauſe even Authority upon which even Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it ſelf depends, depends as much upon that; neither do we more believe the Scripture for Authority, then that very Authority for the Reaſon we think we have to do ſo. The <hi>Samaritan</hi> ſays, I have an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Rule, which is the <hi>Books of Moſes,</hi> and only them. The <hi>Jew</hi> ſays, I cannot erre for I follow the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> which is infallible, and only that. The Chriſtian aſſures himſelf of the Truth as long as he is guided by
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53118:46"/>
the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> whoſe Writings are the infallible dictates of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The <hi>Turk</hi> aſſumes the ſame from the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> and the <hi>Heathen</hi> from <hi>Oracles, Sybill's Books,</hi> and the like. What ſhall I do? None of all theſe Books can be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by their own Light, for there are things equally ſtrange in them all. Follow the Authority of the Church which cannot miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guide you? Moſt willingly: but again the ſame difficulty returns in another habit; for as every one Cries, I follow theſe Books which are <hi>infallible,</hi> ſo he goes on too and ſays, I believe theſe Books to be ſo, becauſe our <hi>Church</hi> and our <hi>Traditions,</hi> which are certainly the beſt Authority,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53118:46"/>
aſſures us that they were written by <hi>Divine inſpiration.</hi> Let the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> take heed of ſaying here, <hi>But my Tradition is more ancient and more Univerſal,</hi> for in the firſt the <hi>Jew</hi> will overcome him, and in both the <hi>Heathen.</hi> I muſt in this diverſity of waies either ſtand ſtill, that is, ſuſpend abſolutely from the belief of any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (which is almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible after the belief that there is a <hi>GOD</hi>) or I muſt chooſe out of theſe. Now Election is a work ſo proper to Reaſon, that it cannot be done by any thing elſe; and therefore to be brought to a neceſſity of an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is to be neceſſarily brought to ſubmit in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53118:47"/>
to the determination of our Underſtanding: So that in matters of Religion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is difference, I chooſe this ſide rather than the other, becauſe my <hi>Reaſon</hi> bids me; and where there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, even there I am wholy guided by my <hi>Reaſon,</hi> becauſe the uncontradicted concurrence of the Parties, makes up a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme to perſwade (I ſay to perſwade onely) my Belief. Briefly, I cannot <hi>Believe</hi> but by an act of the <hi>Will,</hi> nor can I <hi>Will</hi> but according to the directions of the <hi>Underſtanding:</hi> ſo that they who ſay they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Authority, or they follow Divine particular Revelation, or any thing elſe imaginable,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53118:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
do it, becauſe that agrees with their own Reaſon, and will quit the Party as ſoon as it do's other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
