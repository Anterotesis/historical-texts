         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

it purgeth the body from

times the ſoule from more
dangerous ſecurity: and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with this thought, that by
the Phyſitians owne rule, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19119:25"/>
our too common experience,
there is no perfect health in this
world, but a neutrality between
ſickneſſe and health, as no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
pleaſure is more, than to
avoid paines, according as one
thus writeth to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                     <p>There is no health, Phyſitians
ſay, that we at beſt enjoy, but a
Neutrality:</p>
                     <p>And can there be worſe ſickneſſe
than to know,</p>
                     <p>That we are never well, nor can
be ſo?</p>
                     <p>10 The eyes are the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of luſt: therefore make a
Covenant with them, that they
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19119:25"/>
betray not thy heart to vanitie.</p>
                     <p>11 Be ever diligent in ſome
vocation: for continuall eaſe, as
it is more dangerous, is more
weariſome than labour, and it
is no freedome to live licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
nor pleaſure to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome paine.</p>
                     <p>12 Indifferent ſuperiority is

                     <p>15 In all thy attempts let
Honeſty be thy ayme: For he
that climbes by privy deceit,
ſhall fall with open reproach:
and forget not in thy youth to

And if the light that is

how great then ſhall the

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19119:45"/>
Preachers take heed, that they

man, are nothing the ſtronger.
It is decent and comely, that
old men ſhould give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

whom the flouriſhing time of

The example may be
gathered in wood, that even as
the Tree is accounted naught

a wicked and evill perſon, who
when the flower of his youth

what thing can be more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
than a mans minde not to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19119:46"/>
endeavour to attaine ſtrength
and perfection, when all the
parts of his body (by age) are
come to defection and end?
When his eyes waxe dimme,
his eares hard of hearing, his
head bald, his cheeks withered
through lacke of bloud: when
he beginneth to want his teeth,
to have his breath ſtrong and
earthly, his breaſt ſtuffed with
phlegme, evermore troubled

when his legges doe faile un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                     <p>What have we to doe then,

but unto old men it is
more ripe and naturall, as alſo

                     <p>Wherefore a man muſt take

                     <p>HEre muſt we intreat on the
third eye-ſore: namely, if
a young man be found without
obedience, whereby the world
is brought out of good order.
For how doth he thinke to be
reverenced when he commeth
to age, that in his youth will
ſhew no obedience or reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to them which are old?
And therefore it is a common
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19119:48"/>
ſaying among old men, that he
can never play the Maſter well,
who hath not one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
declared himſelfe ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and obedient to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
before.</p>
                     <p>For the which cauſe, our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, in the time
of his being upon the earth in
his fleſh, till the lawfull time
and age of a teacher, that hee
ſhould teach: did ſerve and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
obediently to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
Likewiſe then, as gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ſadneſſe and perfect godly
manners, are looked for and
beheld in old men, ſo to young
men belongeth (of right) hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſervice, ſubjection and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:19119:49"/>
Wherefore in thoſe precepts
and commandements of the
Law, which appertaine to the
love of our neighbour, the firſt
is the honour of Father and
Mother, being commanded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us: that although the carnall
father be not alive, or is unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
yet you muſt to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which is alive, ſhew obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and give honour, till ſuch
time thou commeſt to an age,
worthy to be honoured thy
ſelfe. For this word Father is
taken foure manner of waies in
the Scripture, that is to ſay, by
nature: by the nation or people:
for counſell: and for age. Of
the naturall father, <hi>Iacob</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
to <hi>Laban,</hi> ſaying. <hi>If the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:19119:49"/>
feare of my father</hi> Iſaack <hi>had not
beene here, thou wouldeſt have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
all that I have.</hi> Of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the people, it is ſaid,
when the Lord ſpake to <hi>Moſes</hi>
out of the buſh. <hi>I am the God of
thy Fathers, the God of Abraham,
the God of</hi> Iſaack, <hi>the God of</hi> Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.
Of the father for age and
counſell, it is likewiſe written.
<hi>Aske the Father, and he ſhall tell
thee; and the Elders, and they ſhall
ſhew unto thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore, if thy naturall
Father be dead, and ſo not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be obeyed, if any other
old man doe give thee good
counſell, thou muſt ſhew the
obedience of a young man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him. For how ſhall hee be
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19119:50"/>
honoured in his old age, which
refuſed to follow the good
leſſons of obedience, when he
was a young man himſelfe?
Whatſoever a man doth la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
that ſhall he reape and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
In like manner, all diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
(at the firſt) ſeemeth to be
unpleaſant and painefull: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
it ſhall give to them
that have exerciſed themſelves
therein, the moſt pleaſant and
quiet fruit of right and juſtice.
For like as there is no fruit
found on that Tree, which firſt
did beare no bloſſoms: ſo in
age, that man ſhall never have
the due honour to age, who in
his youth hath not firſt beene
exerciſed with ſome diſcipline.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19119:50"/>
And which way can diſcipline
be without obedience?</p>
                     <p>It followeth then, that a
young man without obedience,
is a young man without diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline:
for obedience is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of all diſcipline. It requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
great exerciſe: example
and rule whereof, it hath taken
by our Lord Ieſu Chriſt, who
being obedient unto his father,
yea to the death, and that to
the death of the croſſe, tooke
upon him gladly ignominy and
rebuke.</p>

loſeth the treaſure which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
of the heavenly
Country. Whereto our Lord
Ieſus called the rich young
man, who demanded of him
the way to perfection, ſaying
to him. <hi>If thou wilt be perfect,
goe and ſell all that thou haſt, and
give it to the poore, and come and
follow me, and thou ſhalt haue trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in heaven.</hi> Which no man

                     <p>Let not him therefore ſleepe
upon his riches, which may do
good unto the poore, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
a rich man have gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
together great ſtore of
goods, yet can he not enjoy
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19119:52"/>
them all alone, in reſpect the
nature of man is ſuſtained with
few and ſmall things. Then
what greater folly can there be
in the world, then for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
feeding and cloathing
of one man, to loſe all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and ſo to purchaſe the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
paines of hell, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hope of any comfort or
helpe?</p>
                     <p>That thing therefore which
of neceſſity thou muſt once for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake,
in hope to be rewarded
againe everlaſtingly, doe thou
diſtribute willingly and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.
For all things which we
behold with our eyes, are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,
but thoſe which we ſee
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19119:52"/>
not, are eternall and everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.
For ſo long as we are
temporall, things of like quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
doe us ſervice, but when we
depart from this earthy abode,
everlaſting joy ſhall attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, and felicity without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
or ending.</p>
                     <p>What reaſon have we to love
thoſe things which we cannot
alway have with us? when we
evidently behold, that the
lands and ſubſtance of a rich
man, doe declare him to be
without wit and judgement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he loveth thoſe things
with the deſire of his whole
heart, which never doe render
him loue againe. For if a man
love gold, ſilver, lands, dainty
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19119:53"/>
fare, fine meats, and bruit
beaſts, the naturall courſe of
things doe teach us, that none
of theſe can yeeld him love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
What thing is then fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from all reaſon, than to
love that which cannot love
thee again, and to neglect that,
which giveth to thee all things
with love? For that cauſe, God
commanded us to love, not the
world, but our neighbour, ſith
that he can render love againe
for love: which thing worldly
goods cannot doe, it is well
knowne. Even ſo God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
us to love our enemy,
that the ſame love may make
him of our enemy, our friend.</p>
                     <p>Let every covetous rich man
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19119:53"/>
therefore, who would have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
riches, diſtribute
(while he is here) to the poore
and needy, thoſe riches which
are but temporall, and doe not
continue for ever. For if a man
will not ſell that thing which
he loveth, how can another
man buy that thing which he
coveteth? and therefore the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
men are called curſed of
the moſt righteous Iudge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they which paſt by them,
did not ſay unto them: <hi>The bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

doe bleſſe you in the name of God.</hi>
Therefore the covetous men
are curſed and unhappy: who
for tranſitory goods doe goe

In the body, by giving good

holy Apoſtle ſaith: and in the
minde, before God we do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
and beginne good works.
For the ſhamefaſtneſſe and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity
of the body is, not to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet
other mens goods, and to
flie all uncleanneſſe: not to eate
and drinke but in time: not to
be a gigler and a provoker of
other men to laughter: no ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19119:56"/>
all things being ſet in comely
order, according to godlineſſe
in all parts of the body, as well
in the haire on the head, as in
the rayment. Not to company
with the ungodly, neither to
looke proudly or diſdainfully
upon any man, nor yet wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly
to caſt up the eyes, to the
evill provocation of other: not
to goe nicely and tripping in
the ſtreete, having a pace like
as it were a game or a play, to
be ſeene, and to tempt other
therewith.</p>
                     <p>To be alſo inferiour unto no
man in good workes, to be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to no man of reproch or
ſhame, to blaſpheme or ſlander

                     <p>The ſhamefaſtneſſe and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity

<hi>A Maſter or a Ruler without
vertue.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IN this place followeth the
ſixt abuſe: namely, a Lord or
Maſter that is without vertue.
For it profiteth nothing to have
power and authority, or to
rule, if the Maſter have not in
himſelfe, the direct and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſway of vertue. But this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
conſiſteth not ſo much in
the externe and outward
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:19119:59"/>
ſtrength of the body, which is
very requiſite and neceſſary for
ſuch as are worldly Rulers, as
it is to be exerciſed in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſtrength, in good and
vertuous manners. For often
times a man doth loſe the
might and power to rule,
through the negligence of the
inward part: as it appeared by
<hi>Eli</hi> the Prieſt, who while he
puniſhed not his children with
the rigorous and ſtrait rod of
juſtice, when they did ſinne:
God, (as one that would be
revenged for their wickedneſſe
upon him) ſharpely puniſhed
him, as one that conſented to
their naughtineſſe.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it is neceſſary,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:19119:59"/>
that Rulers have theſe three
things in them, that is to ſay:
terror to be feared, good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernance,
and love. For except
the Governour be feared and
loved, his ordinance and rule
cannot ſtand. Therfore through
his goodneſſe and honeſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
conditions, let him procure
to get the love of them which
are under him, and alſo by juſt
and diſcreet puniſhment. Not
that he would or ſhould appear
to revenge his owne quarrell
or injurie: but that the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
or breaking of the Law
of God, might be puniſhed, and
ſo to be had in feare.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, while many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
doe depend and hang up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19119:60"/>
him, he himſelfe muſt alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
depend and hang upon
God, and cleave onely to him:
who hath ſet him in that rule:
who hath eſtabliſhed him, and
made him to be a ſtronger man,
whereby to beare the burdens
of many. For except a beame
be laid faſt and ſure, upon a
ſtronger thing which is able to
beare it, all that is laid upon it
ſhall fall downe: yea and it ſelfe
alſo, through the very bigneſſe
and weight of it ſelfe, ſhall fall
to the ground with the burden
thereof. So a Prince or Ruler,
except he ſticke faſt to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
both he himſelfe, and all
that is with him doth quickly
periſh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:19119:60"/>
There be ſome, who after
they be ſet in authority, doe
become better men, and doe
cleave more neere to God,
than they did before: and ſome
are contrariwiſe thereby made
the worſe.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Moſes</hi> after he was made
Governour of the people, he
had communication with God
more familiarly than he had
before. But <hi>Saul</hi> the ſonne of
<hi>Cis,</hi> after he was King, through
his pride and diſobedience,
highly ſinned and offended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Salomon,</hi> after he ſate in
the ſeate of his Lord and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
King <hi>David,</hi> God increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and made him rich with
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:19119:61"/>
the gift of wiſedome, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
over innumerable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
And contrariwiſe, after
that <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the ſervant of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>
had uſurped part of the
kingdome of the houſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
he turned tenne Tribes of
the people of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> which
were in the part of <hi>Samaria,</hi>
from the true and right worſhip
of God, to the wicked and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velliſh
worſhiping of Idols.</p>
                     <p>By which examples, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
and manifeſt, that ſome
men when they doe come to
dignity, doe grow more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and better: and ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
through pride of their
advancement and riſing up, doe
fall and waxe worſe. By both
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:19119:61"/>
the which is to be underſtood,
that they which increaſe in
goodneſſe, doe it by the vertue
and godly diſpoſition of the
minde, even by the onely help
of God: and the other, that
they doe fall by the weakeneſſe
of the minde, through the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
and ſmall regard they
have to vertue, which no man
can have without the helpe of
God.</p>
                     <p>The man that hath many
things under him, whereof he
hath charge, and hath not the
ſtrength and vertue of the
minde, is no way able to fulfill
or performe what he ſhould
doe. For many things do bring
with them many troubles and
vexations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="102" facs="tcp:19119:62"/>
Therefore let every man that
is a Ruler, procure firſt with all
induſtry of his minde, that in
all things he may be ſure of the
helpe of God. For if in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
he have the Lord and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of all Lords and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
to his helper, no man
can ſet light or deſpiſe his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
and rule, becauſe there
is no power but of God. He lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
up the poore and needy
out of the very dunghill, and
maketh him to ſit with the
Princes of his people. Likewiſe
he caſteth downe the mighty
from their ſeate, exalting them
which are meeke and lowly:
that all the world might be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
unto God, &amp; his glory
only exalted.</p>

<hi>A Chriſtian man full of brawling

                     </head>
                     <p>A Moſt irkeſome and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
thing is this ſeventh
abuſe, which now we have in
hand: to wit, a Chriſtian man
full of contention, who by faith
and baptiſme, being a partaker
and a bearer of the name of
Chriſt, doth (againſt the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and minde of Chriſt) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in pleaſures of the world,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:19119:63"/>
which are tranſitory, and doe
daily fall away. Becauſe all
manner of things for which a
man doth ſtrive, doe cauſe the
ſame ſtrife, either for the love
that is borne to them, being a
covetous deſire for himſelfe, or
for the love of ſome other
thing, which lyeth hid under
an odious and hatefull matter.</p>
                     <p>As for example, warre, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be odious and an
hatefull thing, yet is it holden
and maintained on both ſides
with a bold and fierce courage,
for the love and deſire which
men have to winne the victory,
and for the purchaſing of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
In like manner, many other
things are deſired and ſought
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:19119:63"/>
after, with contention, who
may have them firſt before an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other:
by no leſſe hatefull and
painefull labour, yea and feare,
than the other which are got
by moſt deteſtable warre.</p>
                     <p>And therefore a man may
perceive, there is no contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
but for that which is loved,
that is to ſay, for a loving and
a friendly reward, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
to their minde after it is
ended. Whoſoever therefore
ſtriveth for any manner of
thing of this world, ſheweth
evidently and plainely, that he
loveth this world.</p>
                     <p>How then doth the holy
Ghoſt by the mouth of Saint
<hi>Iohn,</hi> forbid that this world
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19119:64"/>
ſhould be loved? to whom he
ſaith, <hi>Love not the world, nor the
things that be in the world.</hi> For
the love of God, and the love
of the word, cannot dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in one heart: even as the
eyes of a man cannot behold
the heaven above; and the
earth beneath, both at once
with one looke.</p>
                     <p>But let us ſearch and ſee,
whether there be in the world,
any thing indeed that is to be
loved, and what is the world
which the ſpeech of God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth
us to love. We are not
commanded to love the earth,
nor the things which come out
of the earth, but onely our
neighbour, for whoſe ſake all
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19119:64"/>
things are made. Him thou art
commanded to love: for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things which doe periſh
and fade away, cannot goe up
with us to heaven. But our
neighbour is heyre (as well as
we) of the kingdome which
ſhall never fayle: and therefore
we muſt love together one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
heartily.</p>
                     <p>For ſo much therefore as we
ſhall not continue alway in the
world, but ſhall fayle alſo with
the world: we are commanded
not to love the world, but our
neighbour, becauſe (yea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on earth) he is a part and
portion of the heavenly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
although he be among
theſe low Elements, which
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19119:65"/>
makes him worthy to be loved
of all ſuch as are deſirers of the
heavenly bliſſe: foraſmuch as
in the high Country, which is
the kingdome of heaven, he
ſhall be heyre with his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
for ever. For this cauſe
God doth forbid us to love this
world: leſt he which ſo loveth,
be ſeparated and made a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
from the love of God. That
thing then ſhould not be ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for, which a man may not
love, becauſe a man bearing the
name of Chriſt, muſt ſee that
he have alſo the ſelfe-ſame or
like manners in him, that Chriſt
had. For no man can worthily
be called a Chriſtian man, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he agree with Chriſt in
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19119:65"/>
manner and good living. As
touching Chriſt, the Prophet
doth write of himſelfe theſe
words. <hi>Behold the childe whom
I have choſen, mine elect, my ſoule
is well pleaſed in him: I will ſend
my ſpirit upon him. He ſhall not
ſtrive, he ſhall not be an outcryer,
nor extend his voyce in the ſtreet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Behold, Chriſt doth not
ſtrive or cry out: therefore if
thou doe covet to be like him
in manners, ſtrive not, leſt thou
appeare to doe nothing, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe
the name of Chriſt in the
Church. For God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

(that in reſpect of that

                     <p>Wherefore then will he be
prowd and high minded here

man of exceeding great power:
who (before all other men)
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:19119:67"/>
ſhould carry and behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
both humble and lowly?</p>
                     <p>But that the poore people
ſhall not beare their poverty
heavily, with ſorrowfulneſſe
and ſadneſſe of heart: let them
heare what they ſhall receive
of God, he ſaith. <hi>Bleſſed are the
poore in ſpirit, for theirs is the

mercifull Iudge doth handle
all things ſo indifferently, that
to them to whom he hath not
given the riches of this world,
he giveth the kingdome of
heaven, that hee may be a rich
man in that glorious place,
who on earthly things hath not

                     <p>Poore men therefore muſt
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:19119:68"/>
take heed, leſt while in poverty
and need they paſſe over the

world: they ſhould (through
the lacke of wiſedome) loſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the kingdome of heaven.
For although by the order and
diſpenſation of God, they doe
live in earthly poverty, yet
they may endeavour to be poor
and meeke in ſpirit. For the
kingdome of God is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to all poore men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

to them onely, in whom the
humble and lowly meekneſſe

ſpirit, who when he is outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
poore and needy, doth not
inwardly extoll himſelfe with
a proud heart, for the lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the minde ſhall doe
more to the attaining of the
kingdome of heaven, then the
temporall poverty and lacke of
worldly riches. For meek and
lowly men poſſeſſing riches,
may be called poore in ſpirit:
whereas thoſe that are prowd,
and yet have nothing, without

the poore in ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of both theſe ſorts, the holy
Scripture ſpeaketh on this
wiſe.</hi> Some make themſelves rich,
although they have nothing, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19119:69"/>
ſome make themſelves poore, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
they have never ſo great riches.</p>
                     <p>The rich man then being
poore in ſpirit, is as a poore
man notwithſtanding all his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:
and the poore man that is

although hee be naked and
poore. It followeth, that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe
of the minde, is a noble

Therefore poore men muſt

                     <p>The Lord for the offence of

what great goodneſſe
commeth of a righteous and

blinde but they may ſee if they

the ſtrength of the whole
Nation, the remedy of all ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,

of the weather, the

                     <p>But yet let every King take
this leſſon with him, and marke

is ſet higheſt in his throne, ſo
(if he miniſter not juſtice) hee
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:19119:73"/>
ſhall be deepeſt in paine. For in

                     <p>THe tenth abuſe, is a negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Biſhop, which gapeth
ambitiouſly to be honoured
and reverenced as a Biſhop:
but doth not the office, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
and duty of a Biſhop in
the ſight of God, whole meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:19119:74"/>
he is commanded to doe.
Therefore let us firſt demand
and enquire, what is meant by
the name and vocable Biſhop,
which is a Greeke word, and is
as much to ſay, as a man ſet in
a high place, to looke farre off
and round about him, as out of
an high Tower.</p>
                     <p>But the cauſe why he is made
a watch-man, and what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
at his hand, the Lord
himſelfe doth open, when by
the mouth of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
he teacheth a Biſhop the
reaſon and cauſe of his office,
ſpeaking on this wiſe.</p>
                     <p>Thou ſonne of man, I have
made thee a watchman over the
houſe of Iſrael: wherefore when
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:19119:75"/>
thou haſt heard what words I do
ſpeake unto thee, thou ſhall
ſhew them to the people, and tell
them that I ſpake the words.
When I ſhall ſay unto the wicked,
thou ſhalt ſurely dye, and thou gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
him not warning thereof, nor
ſpeakeſt to admoniſh the wicked of
his evill way, and ſo to live: then
ſhall the ſame ungodly man dye in
his owne unrighteouſneſſe, but his
bloud will I require at thy hand.
Nevertheleſſe, if thou give war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the wicked, and hee yet
turne not from his ungodlineſſe,
and from his wicked way, hee ſhall
dye in his wickedneſſe, but thou
haſt delivered thy ſoule.</p>
                     <p>It becommeth therefore a
Biſhop, that is ſet to be a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:19119:75"/>
Watch-man over all, to looke
well upon offences, and when
he knoweth them perfectly,
then to cauſe them to be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
if he can, with words and
godly counſell, if he cannot,
then after the rule of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
to avoid them out of the
fellowſhip and company of the
godly, for the Lord ſaith in the
Goſpell. <hi>If thy brother doe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
againſt thee, rebuke him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
thee and him: if hee will
heare thee, thou haſt wonne thy
brother. If hee will not heare thee,
take one or two with thee, that
in the mouth of two or three, all
words may be ratified. If hee will
not heare them, tell the Church.
And if hee will not heare the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:19119:76"/>
Church, take him as an Ethnicke
and a Publican.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>After ſuch an order muſt hee
be driven out, which will not
obey the Biſhop and teacher:
and he that is thus expulſed,
ought not to come in company
either of Teacher or Biſhop.
For it is written of the Prieſt in
the Law:</hi> Let him not take a wife
that is a whore, or polluted, nor
put from her husband: for ſuch an
one is unholy unto his God. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he that doth joyne to him
in company ſuch a body, being
excommunicated by a faithfull
Miniſter, without the conſent
of him: breaketh the Law of
holy Prieſt-hood, which is an
elect kinde of Chriſtian men.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:19119:76"/>
After this faſhion muſt a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
behave himſelfe, over
them to whom hee is a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
but what manner of man,
he muſt be himſelfe, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
Saint</hi> Paul <hi>ſheweth in this
wiſe.</hi> A Biſhop muſt be blameleſſe,
the husband of one wife, watching,
ſober, comely apparrelled, a lover
and maintainer of hoſpitality, apt
to teach. Not given to over-much
Wine, no ſtriker, not greedy of
filthy lucre: but gentle, abhorring
fighting, abhorring covetouſneſſe.
One that ruleth well his owne
houſe, having children in ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
with all gravity and cleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of life. Not a young Scholler,
leſt he, being puffed up, fall into
the ſnares of the divell. Hee muſt
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:19119:77"/>
alſo have a good report of them
which are without, leſt he fall into
the rebuke and ſnare of the divell,
that he may ſhew in worke, that
thing which hee teacheth in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
<hi>Therefore let negligent
Biſhops take heed; for in the
time of vengeance, the Lord
complaineth by the mouth of
his Prophet, ſaying;</hi> My Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
have ground my people to
powder, the ſheepheards did not
feed my flocke, but they did feed

                     <p>But rather let them whom
the Lord hath ſet over his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
procure to give them
meate in due ſeaſon: a meaſure
of Wheate, that is to ſay, pure
and true doctrine, that when
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:19119:77"/>
the Lord commeth, they may
deſerve to have theſe comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

it is comprehended in theſe

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:19119:78"/>
to good and godly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
doe choke themſelves
with the common ſnare of
perdition. For they doe not
eſcape the wrath of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they earneſtly follow
thoſe things which they are
taught. And therefore the
Pſalmiſt ſaith to the people
which will not receive diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline:
<hi>Apprehend and receive
diſcipline, leſt God be ſtirred to
anger.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Diſcipline is a manner of
teaching, which leadeth men
to the amendment of evill and
naughtie manners: it is alſo a
keeping and following of the
rules and leſſons of our Elders,
whereof Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:19119:79"/>
ſaying: <hi>Abide and continue in
diſcipline, God offereth himſelfe
to you, as to his children. But if
yee be out of diſcipline, whereof
ye are made already partakers,
then are yee advouterers, and
not his children.</hi> They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which are gone from
him, and be out of diſcipline,
doe receive no inheritance of
the Kingdome of heaven: but
if children doe receive and
beare the correction of their
fathers diſcipline, let them
not deſpaire or doubt, but
they ſhall receive in time to
come, the inheritance of the
Father.</p>
                     <p>Of this diſcipline <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
ſaying: <hi>Ceaſe from doing
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:19119:79"/>
wickedly, and learne to doe
well.</hi> And the like ſentence
is found in the Pſalmiſt,
who ſaith: <hi>Decline from evill,
and doe good.</hi> Wherefore that
man is very miſerable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy,
which throweth from
him diſcipline: for he is bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
than the Souldiers which
crucified Chriſt, and did cut
out his garment, for hee
doth cut the diſcipline of
Chriſts Church. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
as the coat doth cover
all the body ſaving the head,
even ſo is the whole Church
clad and defended with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
ſaving onely Chriſt,
who is the head of the Church.
And as that coat was whole
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:19119:80"/>
without any ſeame, ſo is this
diſcipline given to the Church
whole and ſound.</p>
                     <p>Of this diſcipline, the Lord
when hee ſhould aſcend up
to his Father, after hee was
riſen from death, ſpake to his
diſciples, ſaying: <hi>Abide yee
here ſtill in the Citie of</hi> Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,
<hi>till yee bee clad from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

of the Church is the
coat of Chriſt, and hee which
is not within this diſcipline, is
out of the body of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Let us not therefore cut
that coate, but let us caſt lots
who ſhall have it: that is to
ſay: Let us breake nothing
of the commandements of

plainely ſheweth us, ſaying.
<hi>I am the way, the truth, and the
