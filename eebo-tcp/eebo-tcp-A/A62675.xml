            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>An ESSAY
Concerning the Power of the
MAGISTRATE, &amp;c.</head>
            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>That Government is from the People, who
had a right to invest the Magistrate with a
Power in those Matters of Religion which
have an Influence on Humane Societies,
but not in others that are meerly Religious,
or have no such Influence.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. A Discourse on this Subject cannot
be unseasonable, whilst so many,
instead of shewing their Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to the Government for res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuing
them from the apparent Danger of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Persecution, are so disaffected for being
depriv'd of the Power of persecuting their
Brethren, that they had rather run the risque
of the Nation's being ruined by the French,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51550:4"/>
and themselves under Popish Persecution, than
to be without that Power; and for want of
it, do in their daily invective Discourses and
Sermons (besides a great many other mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Insinuations) pretend the Church now
to be nearer its Ruin than it was in the late
Reign.</p>
               <p>I cannot but be sensible I incur a great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of exposing my self, by writing on a
Subject in a manner wholly exhausted by the
three incomparable Letters concerning Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
which yet I had rather do, than be
wanting in my Endeavours to encourage im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Liberty and mutual Toleration; which
instead of ruining, is the only way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
both Church and State. Yet this was
not the only Motive that engag'd me in this
Design; for intending to write concerning
what is commonly called <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Power,</hi> I thought it necessary, for the
better handling that Subject, first to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Extent of the Magistrate's Power
in Matters of Religion, lest the Civil and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Power should in my Discourse
(what in the World they frequently do) clash
one with the other. I shall therefore, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
further prefacing, attempt to shew what
Power the Magistrate has in Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Tho to prevent all occasion of Mistake
or Cavil, I shall first explain those Terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:51550:4"/>
2. By the Magistrate, I mean the <hi>Person or
Persons who in every Society have the Supream
Power,</hi> which consists in a Right to make
Laws, and by Force (without which all
Laws would be to no purpose) to oblige the
Unwilling and Disobedient to govern their
Actions according to them.</p>
               <p>3. By Religion, I understand the Belief of
a God, and the Sense and Practice of those
Duties which result from the Knowledg we
have of him and our selves, and the Relation
we stand in to him and our fellow Creatures;
or in short, whatever appears to us from any
convincing Evidence to be our Duty to believe
or practise.</p>
               <p>4. In things relating to our selves, or what
is in our disposal, any Action is lawful where
there is no Law to forbid it: But there is more
than this required to invest a Man with a
Right to deprive others of their natural Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and make Laws that in Conscience
oblige them. Whoever pretends to this, must
have a Commission either from God or Men:
but there is no Person that can pretend to have
an immediate Commission from God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they that lay the Foundation of any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate's
Power, not on a Humane, but a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Right, destroy all Obligation of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to him: for why should I be oblig'd to
obey him on the account of a Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
when he can neither show, nor ever
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51550:5"/>
had any such Commission? And there are
none of his Subjects but what have as good a
Pretence (that is, just none at all) to a Divine
Right. Therefore since no Man can pretend
an immediate Right from Heaven, all the Right
that one more than another has to command,
must be the Consent of the Governed, either
explicitly or implicitly given. But it's said,
the <hi>Powers that be are ordain'd of God;</hi> which
may very fitly and justly be said, since they
are chosen and appointed by those, who had
not only a Power from God to chuse them,
but were absolutely required by the Law of
Self-preservation (imprinted by God on their
Natures) to avoid the Inconveniences and
Dangers of an unsafe State of Nature, by
placing the Power of governing them in one
or more Hands, in such Forms, and under
such Agreements as they should think fit. To
suppose the Powers that be, to be otherwise
from God than as they are the Creatures of
the People, made by them, and for them, is
not only to contradict St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who calls
Government <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Creature or
Contrivance of Man, but the Experience of
all Ages, wherein Men have contrived and
framed various sorts of Governments, as they
thought most convenient for themselves: which
makes it sufficiently evident that all the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
the Magistrates have, are the Gift of their
fellow Men. And,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:51550:5"/>
5. It's as evident that Men could not give
the Magistrate a Power they themselves had
not. Now by the Law of Nature no Man
had a Right to deprive another of his Life,
Liberty, or Property, but in defence and for
the preservation of his Own, which by that
Law he is obliged to preserve, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
had a Right to what-ever is necessary to
that End. But the Difficulty of exercising
this Right, (every one having the same) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
Men to enter into Societies, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to some particular Persons the Inspections
of those things that relate to their common
Good: So that Matters of Right and Wrong,
and generally all that part of Morality relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the reciprocal Duties of Man to Man,
are under the Cognisance of the Magistrate;
and any Man (tho he never so much pretends
Conscience) may be punished for acting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Welfare of the Society; because no
Man's Conscience ought to hinder the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
from discharging his Trust.</p>
               <p>6. But his Power does not extend to those
Duties only that one Man owes another, but
even to those that Man owes to God; I mean
those that have an influence on Humane Life,
and conduce to the Welfare and Support of
Societies, <hi>viz.</hi> the acknowledging a Supreme
Being, who can discern Mens Actions, and is
both willing and able to punish them for
neglecting those Duties that are necessary for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51550:6"/>
the well-being of Mankind. It being impossible
(as is own'd by Pagans as well as Christians)
that any Society can subsist without some No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Religion, or the acknowledging of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
Powers. Therefore the Magistrate is
obliged to punish those who deny the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
of a God, or that he concerns himself
with Humane Affairs; it being the belief of
these things that preserveth them in Peace
and Quiet, and more effectually obliges them
to be true to their Promises and Oaths, and to
perform all their Covenants and Contracts,
and all those other Duties in which their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Happiness consists, than all the Rods and
Axes of the Magistrate. Nor can the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers
of Atheistical Principles, seeing they
destroy Conscience by subverting all Religion,
have any Pretence from it to challenge to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
a Toleration. And this is no greater
Power than one Man had over another in the
State of Nature; for an Atheist may justly
be reckoned an Enemy to Mankind whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
State they are in, and therefore is to be
disarmed, and bound to his good behaviour.
So far then it's evident that the Magistrate's
Power extends in Matters of Religion. But,</p>
               <p>7. As to those Opinions and Actions which
relate to God alone, in which no third Person
has an Interest, wherein conscientious People
may and do differ, (which I call meerly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
to distinguish them from those where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51550:6"/>
others have an Interest) there is no Law of
Nature that gives one Man a Right to use
Force on another; and consequently they
could not invest any of their Brethren with
this Power. All the Right that Equals (as
all by Nature are) have over one another, is
a Right to prevent or repel Force by Force,
and to punish the Aggressor, thereby to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
him or any other from attempting the
like, and to seek Reparation for the Loss su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained.</p>
               <p>They that have no such Power over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as to do themselves any Hurt, much
less to take away their own Lives, have as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Right to deprive others (whom they are
obliged to love as themselves) of their Lives
or Properties, or commit any Violence on them
otherways than may be necessary to defend
themselves, and their own Rights. But what
Right of his Neighbour's does any Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade?
or what Injury or Injustice does he do
him, in worshipping God according to that
Method he judgeth best for the saving his own
Soul? If Men think one another in the
Wrong, common Charity will oblige them
to shew each other their Errors; but this
gives neither a Right to punish, because nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them are any-wise injured: And it's
against the immutable and eternal Law of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
to punish a Person that neither does,
nor designs to do another an Injury. Yea,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51550:7"/>
Christianity, that requires Men to abstain
from Revenge, even after repeated Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and multiplied Injuries, can much less
be supposed to oblige them, who suffer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
nor have any Harm done them, to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
and ill use their Brethren.</p>
               <p>8. If the Magistrate was intrusted by the
Society to use Force on those that hold wrong
Tenets in things merely religious, this Power
upon his Neglect, or Incapacity to use it,
would devolve on them that gave it him; and
then every one would have the same Right
to use Force on them that are in the Wrong,
as to use it in defence of their own Lives and
Properties, when the Magistrate either upon
the suddenness of the Danger, or otherwise,
does not protect them.</p>
               <p>It's an undeniable Argument, that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or (in other words) the Right to
use the Force of the Society, in defence of the
Peoples Lives or Properties, is their own Gift;
because when the Magistrate does not this, the
Right of defending themselves returns to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of them, (who may in defence of
themselves, or what belongs to them, take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Life of an Invader) and so must the
Right of using Force in Matters of meer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
upon the Magistrate's either not using
or misusing it, had they at first intrusted him
with it. But they were so far from having
such a Right one upon the other in the State
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51550:7"/>
of Nature, that Force to bring a Man to a
Religion which he thinks not true, was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
which in that State every one would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void;
and consequently Protection from that
as well as any other Injury, was one of the
Ends of constituting Civil Society.</p>
               <p>9. Could Men have liv'd in Peace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any fear of Fraud or Violence one from
the other, there would have been no need of
Government: Nor can it be supposed that
Men who are by Nature equal, would have
submitted their Lives and Properties to the
Discretion of a single, or a few Persons, but to
prevent those greater Inconveniences. And
that which was the End of erecting Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ought certainly to be the Measure of
its Proceeding. Now it's evident Men might
have lived peaceably and quietly together, and
yet have differ'd in those things that give no
biass to their Conversation, or Actions, with
respect to one another as Members of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety;
and therefore the using Force in these
Matters was not one of the Ends of uniting
under Laws, and submitting to Government,
but the direct contrary to prevent it; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
every one by being a Member of a
Civil Society, has as much Right to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
in his Religious Worship, as in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Matter whatever. And if in Civil Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
the Magistrate never does, and it would
be look'd on as an Injustice if he should any
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51550:8"/>
farther than relates to the good of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
enjoin Men the Care of their Private
Concerns, or force them to a prosecution of
their Private Interest, but only protect them
from being invaded, (which is much the same
as Toleration) there is the same reason he
should no farther use Force in Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
than the Publick Good is concerned,
and only protect Men from being injured by
others in their Private Concerns between God
and themselves.</p>
               <p>10. To suppose that one Man in the State
of Nature had a Right to use Force on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on the account of meer Religion, is to
suppose that State a State of Anarchy, War,
and Confusion; because every one supposing
himself in the right, and not being willing
to submit to another, there must necessarily
happen perpetual Quarrels, Confusions and
Destruction, which is contrary to the Law
of right Reason, whereby in that State Men
were wholly to be governed. The only Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between being in a State of Nature,
and under Government, consists in this, that
under Government Men have debarred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from exercising their natural Rights,
and intrusted the Magistrate to do those things
that in the State of Nature every one of them
had a Right to do; so that the Magistrate's
Power is not larger, but theirs more contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
than it was in that State.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:51550:8"/>
11. If in the State of Nature Men had a
Right to use Force one upon the other for Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
of Opinion; different Nations, who
with respect to one another are still in that
State, may upon that account justly use it,
which would involve almost all Nations (since
there are scarce any but differ, and in their
own Opinions, very materially) in endless
Wars. But they are so far from thinking they
ought to make War for this Reason, that by
the Sacred Laws of Nations, Ambassadors, and
all vested with a Publick Character, have a
Right to exercise their own Religion in the
Country they are sent to, tho never so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to that there established. But,</p>
               <p>12. If the Magistrate of one Society has no
Right to use Force on the Members of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he can have as little to use it on those of
his own, because in becoming their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
he has obliged himself to promote their
Happiness and Welfare: And he that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
with a Power for the Good of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
can never have a Right to use it to the
Prejudice of it, as he manifestly does who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives
his Subjects either of their Lives or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
for things that do not relate to the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or Good of the Civil Society.</p>
               <p>Which either against Foreign or Domestick
Enemies, is best provided for by the Peoples
Union, which arises from the mutual Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their Liberty, whereby the Source
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51550:9"/>
and Foundation of Domestick Enmities is
taken away, and their Strength against Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Enemies encreased; which Union, and
with it the general Welfare of the People,
can only be secured by such a Conduct in the
Governors, as gives impartial Encouragement
to all that are Vertuous and Industrious, and
perfect Security to every one in the Fruits of
their Labours: Which is altogether inconsistent
with the Magistrate's depriving them of those
Fruits, or any part of them, for Matters
meerly Religious, which can only tend to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
a People into Parties and Factions, and to
weaken the State by their Disunion, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
it by their Discontents.</p>
               <p>But this is not the worst; it necessarily tends
to the ruining and beggaring of a Nation,
not only by destroying all Encouragement to
Industry, Frugality, and Labour, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving
People of the Means to carry on those
Trades, upon which the Safety and Riches of
a Nation depend; which must in time depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate
a Country, as we find evident in all
those where Men are not secure in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Fruits of their own and their
Ancestors Labours. But such Tyranny is
much more destructive, when it happens up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Account of Religion; then it wholly
falls on the truly Religious, and Conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
who are the most Just, most Frugal, most
Industrious, and in a word most serviceable
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51550:9"/>
to their Country both in Peace and War: For
that Conscience that makes them suffer rather
than act against it, causeth them to abound
with all those moral Vertues (about which
there are no Contentions) that are necessary
and useful to the Publick.</p>
               <p>But because I shall have further occasion to
mention the fatal Consequences of Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I shall only add here, that there never
was a Nation (especially a trading One, where
Men could with ease remove themselves and
their Effects) long either Rich, Populous or
Happy, where Persecution prevail'd: And on
the contrary, no Nation but what has thriven
proportionably as they have allowed a Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>13. In a word, since it's the Magistrate's
Duty to preserve as much as possible, when
it's not contrary to the greater Good of the
Society, the Property, Quiet and Life of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
individual Person; neither Man nor God
can oblige him to inconsistent or contradictory
things, <hi>viz.</hi> to do this, and deprive the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Society of these, when the Good
of it is not concerned: But the more the
Good of the Society forbids him, the more he
is obliged to use Force, because as the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of those he judges to be erroneous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases;
so not only the Number of the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers,
but even their Sufferings ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
to put a stop to those spreading Errors.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51550:10"/>
But the more the Sufferers are, and the more
they suffer, the more the Publick is damnified;
so that it's evident the Magistrate cannot be
obliged both to promote the Publick Good,
and to use this Power. Nay, the very exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
such a Power is inconsistent with Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and as far as it extends destroys it: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
a Design to deprive People, not only of
their Lives, but Properties, (for conservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of which Government was instituted, and
therefore more sacred than Government it self)
and a Design to govern them are inconsistent.
And has not the Magistrate such a Design,
when he invades the Peoples Rights for things
not tending to the Good of the Society, nor as
much as in their Power, but morally impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
such as acting contrary to their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is? And it's a greater piece of Tyranny
to punish Men for what is morally, than what
is naturally impossible.</p>
               <p>14. If the Magistrate on pretence of the
Honour of God, or the Good of Souls, can use
Force to make Men of that Religion he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be true, there can be no reason why the
same religious Causes should not oblige the
dissenting Subjects to use Force on the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
and his Sect, in order to cause them to
be of that Religion they judg to be true. The
same reason that will justify one, will equally
justify the other: For Property is no more
founded in speculative Opinions or ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51550:10"/>
Practices, than Dominion is; and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
is as much bound to protect his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and not to destroy their Privileges, as
they are to obey him, and not to invade his
Prerogatives. The Duties are reciprocal, and
consequently one Party cannot be bound, but
the other must be so too, so that both or nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are free to use Force in such Cases.</p>
               <p>It's said, the Good of the Society hinders
the Subjects from using Force: The same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
then must hinder the Magistrate too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Men will not endeavour to use Force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, but when they judg themselves
strong enough, and then they will (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Passive Principles they may pretend) as
little fail to do it, if he persecutes them; and
in the mean time they must suffer all he will
inflict: which makes the Argument to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
much stronger against the Magistrate;
the Abuse of whose Power produces greater
and more unavoidable Mischiefs to Mankind
than any thing else can.</p>
               <p>15. By what has been said, I think it's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that Men, tho they are answerable to God
for every Breach of his Laws, yet are accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to one another, for those things only that
relate to their mutual Security and Welfare;
because every Man has so much Interest (and
no more) in another's Conduct; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Government is no further concerned in
Matters of Religion, than as the Principles or
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51550:11"/>
Practices of the different Professors tend to
make them more or less fit for the Duties of
the Society. For which Reason those <hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
that are meerly Speculative, or Practices
that are purely Ceremonial, as having no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
at all to the true Foundation of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ought to be tolerated; for nothing
can be evidently more unjust, than for the
Representative of the Civil Society (as the
Magistrate is) to deprive any of the Rights
of the Society, who has done nothing against
its Interest: nor can any thing be more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
than to suppose a Man's Rights to
the enjoyment of this Life, ought to depend
upon his thinking just as the Magistrate does
about Things relating to the next; or that a
Man's Property in this World is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his having right Notions of Things no
ways relating to it; which is as absurd as that
Property is founded in Grace: and there is as
much dispute who is in the right Opinion, as
who has Grace, every one alike pretending to
it, and none being obliged to submit to the
Determination of another.</p>

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:51550:11"/>
               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>That God has not, either by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or his positive Law, given the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
a Power in Matters meerly Religious.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SINCE it appears that the Magistrate has
not his Power immediately from God,
but from the People; and that God has not
authoriz'd or capacitated them to bestow a
Right on him to use Force in Cases of meer
Religion, it necessary follows that he has no
such Right. But however, to avoid all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Cavilling, let us suppose, that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
both as to the Form and to the
Persons that administer it, is immediately from
God; yet still it's most evident that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
has no such Power.</p>
               <p>1. Which thus I prove: A Right in the
Magistrate to punish for not doing as he
commands, necessarily supposes it a Duty in
the Subject to obey, otherwise he would pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
a Man for not doing what he is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to do: and where there is no Power to
make Laws, or to command, there can be no
Disobedience; and where there is no Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
there punishing on pretence of Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
is manifestly unjust. But that God
has the sole Legislative Power in Matters
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51550:12"/>
meerly Religious, or what only concerns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and can alone prescribe what Honour,
Worship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall be paid him, none (I
suppose) will deny; therefore the Magistrate
has no <hi>Legislative</hi> nor <hi>Coercive</hi> Power, which
cannot subsist without Legislation, to which
it necessarily adheres. And,</p>
               <p>2. As God has reserv'd to himself the sole
Legislature, so he has not given the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
a Right to interpret for others his
Law, or to impose on them in what sense
they must understand it. But he has endowed
Men in general with <hi>Reason,</hi> which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Guide he has obliged them to follow in
judging of the Sense and Meaning of his
Laws; and he that does not follow it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grades
himself from the Rank of rational
Creatures, and highly offends God. And this
is not only evident by the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi>
but confirmed by God's <hi>Positive Law,</hi> which
frequently commands us to make use thereof
in Matters of Religion: We are bid <hi>to prove
all things, and hold fast that which is good; to
try the Spirits; to let no Man deceive us; to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of false Prophets, Seducers, Deceivers; to
judg of our selves what is right.</hi> But how shall
we judg and try? <hi>Not as the Horse and Mule
which have no Vnderstanding, but as Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
and Wise;</hi> that is, by making use of
those Faculties God has given us to discern
between Truth and Falshood, Good and Evil.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51550:12"/>
And he not only forbids us to act contrary to
our Judgment, but requires we should be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
satisfied before we act: For he that acts
when <hi>he doubts, is damn'd;</hi> and <hi>whatsoever is
not of Faith, is Sin.</hi> The Reason is most
evident, why a Man ought not to do an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
when he judges it to be ill, because
to judg an Action to be ill, or displeasing to
God, is the same; and he that forms such a
Judgment of an Action, and yet does it, does
knowingly and willingly displease God, which
is eternally and essentially ill, because no Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
what-ever can make it lawful for
a Creature to do that which he judges will
offend his Creator, or even to act when he
doubts whether it will or no. If then God
rewards and punishes Men according as they
have followed the Dictates of their Reason,
that must needs be the Rule of their Actions,
and not the Commands of the Magistrate;
and consequently the Magistrate can have no
more Right to use Force on a Subject, than a
Subject has on him: for tho he is his Subject
in other Matters, yet in those meerly Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
he is equally a Soveraign, equally Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
as the Magistrate himself; because
where there is no other Judg on Earth but
every one's own Reason, every Man (one as
well as another) is a Supream Judg: Nay,
this Sovereign Right of judging every one for
himself is so inherent, that none can make
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51550:13"/>
this Power over to another. So that it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that the Magistrate upon any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
whatever, can claim a Magisterial Power
in these Matters, but only a Right to advise,
which belongs to every one as well as to him.
And,</p>
               <p>3. The Difference between <hi>Advice</hi> and
<hi>Command</hi> consists in this, that Advice one is
oblig'd to follow, not for the sake of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
that gives it, but for the good that is
contained in it, which he, <hi>to whom</hi> and for
whose sake it is given, is to judg of; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
if he does not think it good, is not
obliged to follow it. It's ridiculous as well as
unjust to use Force in Matters of Advice,
and by Civil Sanctions oblige People to
follow it. Whoever does this, does in effect
(however he may deny it in Words) claim a
Legislative Power. But where there is such a
Power, one is oblig'd to obey upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
and for the sake of the Authority that
commands it: And if the Magistrate had such
a Power, Men would be obliged to profess
whatever Religion he commands them.</p>
               <p>4. The Reason why a Judg is necessary in
Civil and not in <hi>Religious</hi> Controversies, is,
because in Civil Matters it is impossible that
<hi>Titius</hi> should enjoy the things in Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy,
and <hi>Sempronius</hi> too; therefore the <hi>Plaintiff</hi>
must injure the <hi>Defendant</hi> by disquieting his
Possession, or the Defendant wrong the Plaintiff
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51550:13"/>
by keeping his Right from him, so that there
is a necessity of a common Judg between
them, who would be to no purpose if both
Parties were not obliged to acquiesce in his
Sentence, I mean, with an external Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
so as to suffer it to be put in execution;
but not with an Internal, so as to believe it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
just.</p>
               <p>But in Religious Controversies the Case is
otherwise, for there each may hold his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and do the other no wrong nor himself
neither, if he did his best in judging concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Opinion, so that there can be no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of a Judg: And it's further considerable
that here can be none but what is a Party, as
being before engaged either for or against the
Opinion that is to be decided: But for a Party
to judg it against all natural Equity, tho
it's the constant practice of the Clergy to
make profest and highly interessed Parties,
whose Preferments are held by declaring for
such Opinions, to be both Accusers and
Judges; that is, to declare themselves <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,</hi>
and therefore to engross all Preferments,
and their Opponents <hi>Heterodox,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
not to share with them. But if there
is a Judg to whose Determination one is
obliged to submit, he that is so obliged must
give an Internal Consent, because here all <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi>
Compliance contrary to one's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is a <hi>Sin;</hi> but all the Power in the World
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51550:14"/>
is not able to make a Man give an Internal
Consent, because it's not in his own, much
less in another's Power to make him <hi>believe</hi>
or <hi>think</hi> as he pleaseth: Yet were that possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
no Man is qualified to be a Judg but he
that is <hi>infallible;</hi> besides, were there any such
Judg, yet a Man was not to be ruled by him,
except he was convinced he was so. But,</p>
               <p>5. There being no such Judg on Earth,
there is an absolute necessity of leaving those
Controversies to be decided by <hi>God</hi> himself, as
being Matters wholly relating to him, and
consequently wholly to be left to him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for the Magistrate to punish any for act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
according to their Judgments, is not only
invading the <hi>Rights</hi> of his Fellow-men, but
the <hi>Prerogative of God himself,</hi> in taking upon
him to judg those Matters <hi>God</hi> has reserv'd
for his own <hi>Tribunal.</hi> Nay, he goes further
than this, and punisheth Men for obeying
God rather than himself. God requires Man
to worship him as he in his Conscience thinks
<hi>most agreeable to his Will;</hi> and the Magistrate
threatneth him if he does so, to Fine, Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and Ruin him, which is setting himself
<hi>above God;</hi> a Crime greater than that of <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,</hi>
who only attempted an Equality with
his Maker, not a <hi>Superiority above him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. It's said, the Magistrate has a Right to
hinder his Subjects from following their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
when erroneous. Which is very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51550:14"/>
for if a Man was not oblig'd to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Conscience for fear of its being
erroneous, no Man would be obliged to act
according to his Conscience at all, since the
mistaken Person thinks himself as much in the
right, nay is generally more confident than he
that is really so: So that if <hi>one</hi> must follow
his Conscience, there's the same necessity for
<hi>all,</hi> because all equally judg themselves in the
Right. But if the Magistrate is to judg
whose Conscience is erroneous, then Men
must desert their Consciences, and all the
World over profess the same Principles with
the Magistrates they live under. For Civil
Government is every where the same, and one
Magistrate as well as another has an equal
right to judg who of his Subjects have errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Consciences.</p>
               <p>7. If it be Mens indispensible Duty to
<hi>worship God</hi> according to <hi>Conscience,</hi> and that
publickly too, (for the more publick the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is, the more it tends to the Glory of God)
it must be their Duty to use the Means that
are necessary to that End; and consequently,
if it be necessary, oppose Force to Force: for the
Magistrate in things beyond his Commission,
is but a private Person; and People do no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
in defending that Right none can have
a right to deprive them of, and which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
cannot part with; it being the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Right of Human Nature, to <hi>worship</hi> God
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51550:15"/>
according to <hi>Conviction,</hi> which is antecedent
to all Government, and can never be subject
to it. But,</p>
               <p>8. If the Magistrate has a Right to use
Force in Matters of meer Religion, he must
have this Right by <hi>God's positive Law,</hi> or by
the <hi>Law of Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that he has no such Power by <hi>God's po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Law,</hi> is evident from this one Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
that all Mankind (except the <hi>Jews</hi>
whose Laws were not obligatory to other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)
were under no Law but that of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
until the coming of Christ: But Christ,
whose <hi>Kingdom is not of this World,</hi> and who
disclaimed all Civil Power, made no Change
or Alteration in the Civil Rights and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Mankind, which he must have done
had he made Mens Properties depend upon
their thinking or acting in Matters purely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
according to the Magistrate's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>As Christ and the Magistrate have each
their distinct <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> so they must have
each their <hi>Limits</hi> and <hi>Bounds;</hi> the Magistrate's
Kingdom (it's true) must be subservient to
<hi>Christ</hi>'s in punishing <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Immorality,</hi> and
in preserving People from being molested in
their Civil Rights for worshipping God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Conscience; and here he still keeps
within the Confines of his own Kingdom: but
if he exerciseth a Legislature in Christ's, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51550:15"/>
makes use of Violence to put his Laws in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
he assumes a greater Power than <hi>Christ</hi>
himself claims. But,</p>
               <p>9. If the Magistrate claims such a Right
by the Law of Nature, that Right ought ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be made appear, because there is no part
of that Law but what is most clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p>To prove he has such a Power, it's usually
urged, that if <hi>Parents</hi> by the Law of Nature
have a right to use Force on their <hi>Children</hi> in
Matters of meer Religion; the Magistrate,
whose Power over his <hi>Subjects</hi> is much greater
than that of <hi>Parents</hi> over their <hi>Children,</hi> has at
least as great a Right.</p>
               <p>I answer; It's a Duty in <hi>Parents,</hi> for the
Good of their <hi>Children,</hi> (for which they are
fitted by their natural Love and Tenderness)
to <hi>supply the Defects</hi> of their Understanding,
until they are capable of understanding for
themselves. Before which time Parents no
doubt will instruct them in their own Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
whether <hi>Paganism, Judaism,</hi> or <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metism;</hi>
yet no Man will suppose that they
can justly use Force on them when they come
to Years of Discretion, to make them em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
those Religions or any other. And yet
the Case between the Magistrate and his
Subjects, is very different from that of Parents
and Children in their Nonage; because the
Magistrate is not in those Matters to supply
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51550:16"/>
the Defects of his Subjects Understanding for
a time, but his Power reaches to Men of all
Ages and Capacities: so that it's evident that
the Reason that subjects Children in their
Nonage to the use of Force, does not all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
Men at Years of Discretion.</p>
               <p>10. It's granted by all, that a <hi>Heathen</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
has no right to judg in Matters simply
Religious; how then comes a <hi>Christian</hi> by the
Law of Nature to obtain this <hi>Charter,</hi> since
that Law allows one Magistrate no more
Power than another? and what is done by a
competent Authority, tho not right, yet is
valid, <hi>ratum si non rectum.</hi> And as Civil
Power is every where the same, so let me add
<hi>Church-Power</hi> is so too; so that the <hi>Church</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
give any new Power to the Magistrate by
his becoming a Member of it, nor the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
any new Power to the Church by his
coming into it.</p>
               <p>11. It's said, the Law of Nature obligeth
every one in his Station to promote the true
Religion; and for that reason the Magistrate
is obliged to exercise a Coercive Power in
Matters meerly Religious.</p>
               <p>The Magistrate no doubt is to make use of
his Power in things that belong to his Station,
but meerly religious Ones, as it has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
proved, do not; as to those he is no
more than a private Person, nay, the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
cannot own him for more, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51550:16"/>
their own Supremacy in Matters Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
which includes meerly religious Ones,
except there can be more than one Supream in
the same thing.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>That a Power in the Magistrate to use Force in
Matters of meer Religion, tends to Mens
Eternal Ruin.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. BUT if the Magistrate has any such
Power from the Law of Nature, it
must be because it tends to promote, either the
Eternal or Temporal Good of Mankind, or the
Honour of God: But to take away the least
Colour of any Right upon these Pretences, I
shall show, first, the Exercise of such a Power
is destructive of Man's Eternal Happiness.
<hi>2dly.</hi> Of his Temporal, and contrary to all
those Laws that for our mutual good God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of us. <hi>3dly.</hi> That it is directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to, and inconsistent with the Honour of
God.</p>
               <p>2. As to the first; It is of fatal Consequence
to the <hi>Eternal Happiness of Mankind,</hi> in having
a direct tendency to make them act <hi>contrary
to their Consciences.</hi> For since Force can no
more work a Change or Alteration on the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51550:17"/>
                  <hi>Mind,</hi> than Arguments can on <hi>Matter,</hi> all
that it can do, is to make Men unwilling to
lie under the weight of it; which they have
no way of avoiding, but by acting as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
will have them; the Truth of which
Force is wholly unapt to convince them
of, and can only produce an outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance,
the Conscience still remaining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse:
For nothing is more evident, than
that where a thing is wholly impertinent
to convince the Conscience, (as Violence is)
and yet it obligeth a Man to act, it obligeth
him to act contrary to his Conscience; which
is directly contrary to his Eternal Happiness:
For if he that acts <hi>when he doubts is damned,</hi>
he cannot certainly be in a better Condition,
who wholly revolts from his Conscience, and
basely lieth both to <hi>God and Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The true Religion it self can neither
judg nor punish; but the Magistrate by the
True Religion means his <hi>own;</hi> and since all
Magistrates think themselves in the right,
they (if Force is to be used) must think
themselves oblig'd to use it: And consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if one useth Force to make People <hi>profess a
True Doctrine or Religion,</hi> there are at least
five hundred who would use it to make People,
contrary to their Consciences, profess a False
Religion, either in whole or part, than which
there can be nothing more impious; nor would
the Matter be much mended, if the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51550:17"/>
forceth Men to profess the True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which yet is certainly false to them
whilst they believe it so. And the forcing
People to profess either a true or false Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
is equally prejudicial to the Common-Wealth,
and consequently upon that account
equally sinful; because when Men, by acting
against their Consciences, are brought to have
no regard to them, they will not scruple to
break those moral Duties which all Religions
teach, and in the observing of which Man's
mutual Happiness consists: therefore the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
is so far from having a right to punish
Men for acting according to their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that it's his Duty to see they do not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
them, tho supposed never so erroneous;
and consequently all Force is religiously to
be abstain'd from; which, as Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
(Chap. 5. n. 96.) observeth, may make
Men counterfeit, but cannot make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
and therefore is fit to breed Form
without, and Atheism within: Yet this is not
the only fatal Consequence of this Doctrine,
but as I shall show in my next,</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Compulsion is inconsistent with all those Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that God, for the sake of Mens Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Happiness, requires of one towards
another.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. NOthing can be more diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to all those Precepts of <hi>Love,
Charity, Kindness, Gentleness, Meekness, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
Forbearance,</hi> the Gospel is in a manner
composed of, than Mens ill using one another
for different Sentiments in things meerly Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.
To pretend Love, Kindness, Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet vex, oppress, and ruin, is
no better than mocking and sporting with the
Miseries of those we have so treated. First
to kiss and then betray, is the basest Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy,
if that can pass for Hypocrisy which open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proclaims at how great a distance Mens
Words and Actions are. The kindest Office
one Man can do to another is, if he thinks
him in an Error, to endeavour to convince
him of it; who tho he continues in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Opinion, yet the Obligation to the other
for his good Intention still remains, and this
Benefit he may obtain by it, that by examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51550:18"/>
the Reasons on both Sides, he is more
likely to discover the Truth; yet should he
mistake after he has impartially examined the
Point, his Error would be wholly innocent,
since he has done what he can to find out the
Truth, and God requires no more; but to
cause a Person to be persecuted for being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental
in this, is the most unnatural and
diabolical thing that can be.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Object.</hi> It's usually said, 'tis not want of
Charity, but the greatest that can be to hinder
Men by Force from professing such Opinions
as are destructive to their Souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> But I say, <hi>first,</hi> that it's against
Charity for the Magistrate to do a real Ill to
his Subjects, when by it he (who is as falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as those he persecutes) is as likely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Error as Truth; because if the Error
ballanceth the Truth, it's doing Mischief for
Mischief's sake: now since Truth is but
one, and Falshood almost infinite, there's a
prodigious odds; he persecutes his Subjects
to establish Error.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> I answer, That Opinions meerly as
such, are not destructive of Mens Souls; for
God who has made Man liable to mistake,
does not require an Impossibility of him, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be mistaken, but that he impartially
searches after religious Truth, and sincerely
endeavours to discover it by those Helps and
Abilities he has bestowed on him to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51550:19"/>
He therefore that does this, has the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of doing his Duty as a rational
Creature, and may be sure, tho he misseth
Truth, he shall not miss the Reward of it,
since he has followed, as well as he could, (and
no more could be his Duty) the only Guide
God has given him to judg of Truth and
Falshood. And if it be no Fault in a Judg that
condemns an innocent Person, if upon sufficient
Evidence he appears guilty; the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
will hold as strong for the Innocence of
an Opinion, that a Man after he has impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
considered embraceth for Truth, and
by which he prejudiceth no Person. And if
he that has lost his Senses, if it be not by his
own Fault, is not accountable for what he
does; there is as little reason that he should,
who acts according to the best of his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;
for it's the Sincerity of the Heart,
and the Goodness of the Intention that God
wholly regards: And the ignorant and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
(if it be not their own Fault) are as
acceptable to him as the knowing and not
mistaken; since it's he that causes the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of Mens Understandings, as well as
Circumstances, (which last makes the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow's
Mite, tho very inconsiderable in it
self) as acceptable as the great Presents of the
Rich. So that two Men that are of different
Religions, may be both in the right Way to
Heaven, provided they do their endeavour to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51550:19"/>
find out the Truth. For it's inconsistent with
Justice to give a <hi>Being</hi> to any Creature that
must necessarily make it more miserable than
<hi>not to be;</hi> which must be, if Men are to be
punished eternally for unavoidable Mistakes:
But God who could have no other Design in
creating our immortal Minds, than that they
should be happy, consequently has given
them all (since they are all equally from him)
sufficient Means to make themselves so; so
that it's strangely absurd, as well as injurious
to an infinitely perfect Being, to suppose he is
a respecter of Persons, or that he has made
Mens Eternal Happiness or Misery to depend
on such Accidents, as being born in <hi>England,
Rome, Turky, China,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Promulgation is certainly essential to a Law;
and therefore those that have no opportunity
of being convinced of the Truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
shall not be accountable for not believing
it, but shall be judged by the Law they know,
and not by that they did not know; nor shall
those that do believe the Gospel, if after a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
search they are mistaken in some Points
of it, be condemn'd for it, because those Points
cannot be said to be sufficiently promulgated
to them. To doubt of this, is to question the
Justice of God; therefore I may safely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that whoever does what God requires
from him shall be rewarded; and that God
requires no more from every one, but that he
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51550:20"/>
shall use his honest Endeavour by all means,
to know and understand his Will as perfectly
as he can, provided when known he does his
best Endeavours to live up to it; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the greatest Charity the Magistrate is
capable of doing, is not to prejudice Men in
their grand Choice by Punishments or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
but to leave them entirely at Liberty
as the most likely way to find out the Truth;
or if they miss it, to make their Mistakes
wholly innocent. But of that more hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>3. All the Uncharitableness, Animosities,
Envy and Hatred that reigns amongst dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Parties, are owing to Persecution, and
not to the bare Differences of Opinions, which
of themselves are no more apt to produce
these Effects, than different Complexions or
Palats; for to see a Man in an Error, is apt
to create Pity in us, a Passion very opposite
to Hatred: Nor would there be the least
Grounds for Uncharitableness, if no Man was
to be harassed in his Name, Goods, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
for any speculative Opinion or outward
way of Worship; but to use one ill upon
that account, sets him at perfect Enmity, and
creates a Quarrel.</p>
               <p>The Heathens, who had more and wider
Differences about Matters of Religion than
the Christians, yet because they tolerated
one another, had not those irreconcilable Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51550:20"/>
fierce Contentions and unnatural
Wars, which have frequently happened since
the Propagation of the Christian Religion;
which yet without Impiety cannot be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to its Genius, which is pure, peaceable,
and inoffensive, and requires a universal Love
and Charity for all Men of what Profession
soever. No, it's the Antichristian Doctrine
of Persecution that has transformed the mild
and sociable Nature of Man into greater Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocity
than that of Wolves and Tigers: for
nothing (it's certain) can more exasperate
the Minds of Men, than to be ill used for
following the Dictates of their Consciences;
for then every one of them, since they all
suffer upon the same Account, will be apt to
resent, not only what is done to himself, but
to the rest of his Sect, who cannot but think
their Persecutors their mortal Enemies, since
they not only use them ill without any manner
of Provocation, but (as they cannot but sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
endeavour to force them to ruin them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
eternally; and they, if ever they get
their Persecutors in their Power, will in all
likelihood double or treble on them what
themselves suffered: So by degrees Men ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
to the height of Fury, Rage and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and break thrô not only all the Ties of
Christianity, but even Humanity; tho whilst
they thus furnish such powerful Provocations
to endless Discords, Hatreds, Factions, Wars,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51550:21"/>
Massacres, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they have nothing in their
Mouths but the Good of the Church and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Souls, not considering that without
Love they cannot be Christ's Disciples, (<hi>John
13.</hi>) and that all other Duties without Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
profit nothing. But what is more oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to these, than to tempt Men to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
miserable <hi>hereafter,</hi> to avoid being so
<hi>here?</hi> For either they must continue all their
Lives under Persecution, (which who can
support?) or else they must buy their temporal
Quiet with the loss of their Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
But,</p>
               <p>4. This Doctrine of Compulsion is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inconsistent with Love, Meekness, and
such-like, but directly contrary to the very
Foundation of natural Equity and Justice, in
causing Men to do as they would not be done
unto; for they that are (when they have the
Civil Power on their side) for judging for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and punishing them for not acting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Judgments, are unwilling
that others, when the Scales of Authority are
turned, should judg for them in like manner.
Tho then there's nothing they can plead for
themselves, but what before they condemned
in others; and it would be as ridiculous to
request those that they before ill used, to have
regard to the common Rules of Justice, as it
would have been in those Scythians who sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
all Strangers to their Gods, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51550:21"/>
others to have respect to the Laws of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitality.</p>
               <p>5. It may be objected, That the Rule of
doing as you would be done unto does not
hold, because one Magistrate is in the Right,
and the other not; and consequently he that is
in the Right himself, has a Right to judg, but
not <hi>vice versa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> But since the Dispute is who is in
the Right, it's ridiculous to say, he that's on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Right has a Power to judg, except
there were some Superiour to determine which
of them is in the Right; but there being no such
Superiour, every Magistrate is to judg for
himself, who to be sure will judg himself in
the Right, and consequently those that differ
from him in the Wrong: And there can be no
reason why one Magistrate as well as another
has not a Right to judg, since that Right is
founded in being a Magistrate, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to them all: And there can be no Reason
for the Orthodox punishing Schismaticks, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
Mahometans, Jews, Pagans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
but what will equally oblige them, as long as
they believe themselves to be Orthodox, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
those that really are so. Therefore the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
of any Persecution are guilty of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
and abetting all Persecution what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
even that under which themselves suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
since they can frame no Arguments to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify
the using Force to promote the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51550:22"/>
but what will equally serve in behalf of
any Religion that's believed to be true: As
we find the loose Harangues of <hi>Austin</hi> upon
that Subject are urged by the Patrons of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
of what Sect or Denomination so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
And since there can be no Argument to
prosecute Error, but what will be turned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Truth it self, let the Persecutors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
judg whether it's not better to leave all
such disputable Points to the only just Judg,
than to take them into their own Hands; who,
were they wholly ignorant in what part of
the World their Station was to be, would be
glad there was no such thing as Persecution,
rather than run the risque of being persecuted
themselves, which shows that even they look
on it in general as an ill thing; and it's better
certainly that a particular Inconvenience (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
Toleration to be such) should be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
than such a Universal Mischief as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
is, should prevail.</p>
               <p>It's said, do as you would be done unto, is
not properly a Law to warrant the thing we
are about, but only a Rule to direct us what
Measures we ought to observe in our acting
with others, when the thing it self is lawful.
Which granting to be true, yet for a Man
to judg which is the true Religion, and act
according to that Judgment, all agree is
not only lawful, but a Duty, because all agree
themselves are obliged to act so; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51550:22"/>
if I desire this Liberty for my self, I ought
not to deny it to my Brother, seeing he is a
Man, and I am no more, and therefore no
more infallible than he, and for that reason
can have no more Right to persecute him into
my Opinion, than he has to force me into his;
for between Equals there ought to be an equal
Measure: Now by Nature all Men are equal,
and have an equal and natural Right of serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God as they think best; and no accidental
Difference as to other Matters, can deprive
them of this Right. In a word, there can be
no reason to deny the Obligation of this Rule
in this Case, but what will equally destroy it
in any other. But,</p>
               <p>6. Persecution destroys not only natural
Equity and Justice, but breaks all the Ties of
Kindred, Blood, Gratitude, Merit; because,
let a Man be never so nearly related to one of
persecuting Principles, or have done him all
the important Kindnesses imaginable, or have
never so much Merit, be never so useful to the
Publick, or be never so exemplary in his Life
and Conversation, that will but the sooner
expose him to suffer, not only because People
are apt to be influenced by such a one, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
according to the Persecutor's Principles
he is obliged to harass him sooner than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
out of pure love to him, it being the
kindest thing he is capable of doing him:
So that without a Figure it may justly be said
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51550:23"/>
of all Persecutors, that their very Mercies and
Kindnesses are Cruelties. But,</p>
               <p>7. This is not all, this Doctrine of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion
annuls all Obligations of the most Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Oaths; for if the Magistrate is obliged
by God to use Force on his dissenting Subjects,
no Promises to indemnify them, tho sworn
to with the most solemn Oaths, ought to
be kept, because all such Oaths are void from
the beginning, the Magistrate being under a
prior Obligation to God (which is not in his
Power to dispense with) to punish them;
which must make all Quarrels between the
Magistrate and his dissenting Subjects immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
since there can be no Security given that
they shall not be punished for their Religion
when-ever it is in the Magistrate's Power:
and by the same Reason, all Articles and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
that Towns or Countries make for
Liberty of Conscience, upon their submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themselves, are null and void; and so are
all the Promises which Popish Kings have
made to their Protestant Subjects, because
they are obliged to punish Hereticks, (which
they suppose Protestants to be) and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
cannot but think their Oaths unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
And all our late Laws for Liberty of
Conscience are in themselves void, because he
that has the Power of the Sword, is required
by God's Laws (which no Human Ones can
supersede) to punish Dissenters from the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51550:23"/>
true Church: And if all these Obligations are
void in themselves, what Reason is there that
those between Sovereign and Sovereign should
be more firm, when either of them judg the
breaking them will tend to advance the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God, since, as they cannot pretend
to have so great a tenderness for the Right of
Foreigners, as of their own Subjects, so they
cannot but know that God is equally disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
by false Religions in one Place as in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother?
And it's but a poor Zeal for his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
that looks no farther than such a Lake,
River, or Mountain, the usual Boundaries of
Kingdoms; which would be the way to set
all Mankind together by the Ears. But,</p>
               <p>8. Suppose it should not always have that
Effect, yet it must necessarily destroy all Trade
and Commerce between Nations of different
Perswasions; for who would venture into a
Foreign Nation, except he were of the same
Perswasion with them, if they were equally
obliged to punish Men for false Religions or
Doctrines, as well as for Theft and Murder,
<hi>&amp;c?</hi> which must necessarily discourage all
Commerce, and make Nations most inhospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and barbarous: And if Persecutors do
not follow this Method, it's because they do
not act according to their own Principles,</p>
               <p>9. Which root out all Mercy, and take
from the Magistrate all Power of pardoning
any Crime whatever, and from all private
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51550:24"/>
Persons the forgiving their Enemies: For if
the Magistrate is not to act as the Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of the Civil Society only, but also to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Offences against God, meerly as such, tho
he may forgive any Crime against himself, or
pardon the breach of his own Laws; yet these
being also Sins against God, he is obliged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God's Account to punish Men for the
Breach of them, as well as for Infidelity or
Heresy: And all private Persons, tho they
must forgive their Brethren, not only seven,
but seven times seven, yet the not punishing
them by this Doctrine is wholly put out of
their Power, because it obliges them to shew
their Zeal for God's Honour, in getting the
Magistrate to punish them, who by injuring
their Brethren, offend against God.</p>
               <p>10. In a word, this Doctrine of Force is
directly contrary to the main Design of all
God's Laws, wherein Men are concerned one
with another, which is their mutual Good:
As for Instance; The forbidding Murder is
intended for the Security of Mens greatest
Good, their Lives; which would be strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
defeated, if the Supream Powers were to
punish with Death those they judg do disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
God with their false Worship, because it
would not fail to fill the World with Blood
and Slaughter, since the Governours of it are
as opposite in their Judgments about these
Matters, as in the Fable the Man's two Wives
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51550:24"/>
were, where his old one pluckt out his black
Hairs, and his young Wife his gray Ones.</p>
               <p>But suppose the Supream Powers were
not oblig'd to deprive People of their Lives,
but only of their Properties, (not to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that even that would destroy great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
by robbing them of the Necessaries of
Life) the end of all those Laws which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
all kinds of Injuries, and require mutual
Assistance one towards another for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good, would be in a manner destroyed,
since a great part of Mankind must be una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
miserable, by being either at once,
or by degrees, deprived of the means of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
happily, and the rest would hold what
they possess but by a precarious Tenure,
since it would depend on their Governours,
(tho they had never so many successively) or
their own not changing their Opinions, (nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of which is in their Power to hinder)
whether they should enjoy any thing or not.
Therefore it shews the greatest Indiscretion in
those (who tho they have a share in the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislature,
yet are subject to the Laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
to consent to any persecuting Ones, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot be sure but that they are
contriving Rods for their own Backs, or for
their Childrens or near Relations: and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
there are few Persecutors (for all their
Zeal) but would rather Speculative Points
were wholly left to the merciful and wise
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51550:25"/>
Judgment of God, than to have their own
Families or Friends ruin'd about them. But
to return; In vain are the Magistrates requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not to tyrannize over and oppress their
Subjects, if they are to punish them for not
being of the same Perswasion with them. It
had been much happier for Men in relation to
their Temporal, as well as Eternal Condition,
to be in a State of Nature, than to let Tyrants
deprive them of the Comforts of this Life, for
no other Reason than not daring to act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their Consciences in things not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to this Life: And People, where they
oppress one the other, when the Good of the
Society cannot be pretended, may justly be
reckoned in a worse State than that of Nature,
<hi>viz.</hi> of War, which is never at an end as
long as there are Men who cannot comply
with all those things, that out of Ignorance,
Superstition, Ambition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are established as
necessary to Church-Communion.</p>
               <p>11. In a word; Can Men oppress, ruin and
kill for God's sake, and destroy all moral Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
on pretence of Religion? which when
it serves to no other end than to enflame the
Tempers of Men, and set a keener Edg on
their Spirits, and to make them ten times
more the Children of Wrath and Cruelty than
they are by Nature, does surely lose its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and ceases to be Religion; for let Men
say worse of Infidelity and Atheism if they can.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:51550:25"/>
But if, on the contrary, the ruining those
that do nothing against the Welfare of the
Society, becomes an Act of Piety, when it's
made use of to extirpate a false Religion or
Opinion, there are no Crimes whatever but
by the same reason will become religious and
vertuous Actions, if they are equally service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the same pious End; <hi>scelera ipsa nef as<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan>
hâc mercede placent:</hi> and consequently it
would be an Act of Piety and Vertue to make
use of pious Frauds to calumniate, to lie, to
bear false Witness, to murder, to assassinate
even the Magistrate himself.</p>
               <p>12. Thus, whereas Religion has no other
Design than the Advancement of Man's Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
and God's Glory; this persecuting
Humour is so far from being serviceable to the
former, that it's plainly destructive of it: for
whereas in order to that good End, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
has directed all Stations and Relations of
Men so to act, as may best tend to Love and
peace, (the true Basis of the Happiness of
the Society) this drives them all to contrary
Motions; for Magistrates are incited to ruin
those for whose Good they were instituted.</p>
               <p>Subjects are tempted to disobey their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
and retaliate Persecution so much
the more fiercely, by how much greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
their Opinions and Actions have upon
the Community.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:51550:26"/>
Nor does it only destroy the Peace of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
within its own Bowels, but it engageth
one Nation against another. And,</p>
               <p>13. As it destroys all these Publick Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
by the same reason all private Ones
(which are not so great as those owing to the
Publick) must cease; so that it embroileth
private Families, subverts the mutual Duties
between Parents and Children, Husbands and
Wives, Masters and Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> seducing
them into a belief, that the way to be service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to one another's Eternal Interest, is by
being cruel to their Temporal; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the more Charity they owe one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the sooner they are to use one another
ill. Nor can there by any reason why the
doing this of themselves is not as effectual
to promote each others Eternal Happiness, as
the doing the very same at the command of
the Magistrate, (who is every whit as fallible
as they) or why they need more to expect a
Command to use Force, than to give Advice,
if one as well as the other has a tendency to
promote (which is every ones Duty) the Good
of Souls, and the Honour of God.</p>
               <p>Now tho Persecution tends no less to the
Dishonour of God, than the Unhappiness of
Man; yet because hitherto we see God's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
no otherwise concerned than indirectly
and by consequence, I shall therefore show in
my next,</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="chapter">
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:51550:26"/>
               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>That the Doctrine of Compulsion is directly
contrary to the Honour of God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. THE only way that Men can render
immediate Honour to God, is by
worshipping him according to that Method
they think most agreeable to his Will: If
therefore the Magistrate punisheth them for
so doing, he setteth himself in direct opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Honour of God: For then he must
by Force endeavour to hinder them, either
from worshipping God at all, which is the
way to make them down-right Irreligious, or
else force them to worship him in a way
they believe he has forbid; which is adding
to the neglect of worshipping him as they
ought, down-right Affronts, and under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of appeasing his Anger, (which is the
Design of their solemn Devotion) provoking
him by a notorious Dissimulation and a mock-Worship.
Therefore without setting himself
against God, he cannot deny them the entire
liberty of worshipping him as they think best,
and that publickly too; for the more publick
the Worship is, the more it tends to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
To acknowledg that Men in private
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51550:27"/>
ought to worship God according to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
and to deny it's their Duty to do so
in Publick, is very absurd; or if it be their
Duty, to pretend to have a Right from God to
hinder them from doing their Duty, is more
absurd.</p>
               <p>In short, what can shew a greater Defiance
of the Almighty, and relish more of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Devil, than to persecute Men for
expressing their Love and Zeal for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God, which they can no otherwise
do, than by worshipping him according to
their Consciences? And God will resent as
done to himself, what-ever is done to a Child
of his upon that account. And Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
do not come much behind that Italian
in Impiety, who made his Enemy blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
God, and then stab'd him, when they
make innocent Persons who are no ways their
Enemies, or have not done them the least In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
not only once, but for all their Lives,
guilty of a most detestable Apostacy, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting
from their Consciences, and instead
of honouring, offer God nothing but Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
and Affronts, and ready to commit (the
Ties of Conscience once broken) all manner
of Impieties and Villanies.</p>
               <p>2. Men can no otherwise honour God, than
by entertaining such Conceptions of him, as
tend to make them love, reverence, and fear
him. Now the more any Nation doth this,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51550:27"/>
the more by it they honour him; and since
what gives one a higher Idea of God and his
Perfections, may have a different Effect upon
another, Men may have different Ideas, and
yet equally honour God. Therefore it's very
unjust in the different Sects to condemn each
the other for dishonouring God, when each
Party prefer their own Opinions, because
they create in them the greater Esteem, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
and Honour for God; and the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
they apprehend, in respect of their own,
as injurious and dishonourable to him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to punish Men for honouring God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their own Ideas, or to think they can
honour him any otherwise, is very absurd.</p>
               <p>3. Besides, this Doctrine of Compulsion
reflects highly on the Honour of God, in
making him act inconsistently, by obliging
Men to judg for themselves, and honour God
according to the best of their Judgments; and
at the same time requiring the Magistrate to
judg for them, and to make them act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his, and not their own Judgments.</p>
               <p>What I pray can be more injurious to the
Justice as well as Goodness of God, than to
suppose he has exposed the truly Religious and
Conscientious to be every-where ill used,
whilst Men of no Religion will be sure to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape
by outwardly complying with that of
the Magistrate's? so that none but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious,
and they too for being such, are
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51550:28"/>
subject to perpetual Misery. Such an impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Doctrine is so far from having a Divine
Original, that it could owe its Rise to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the grand Enemy of Mankind, it
being his Contrivance to tempt Men to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
God by their Hypocrisy, or else gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
his Malice on those that refuse. But,</p>
               <p>4. It's farther dishonourable to God, in
making the two grand Commands, The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God, and the Good of Mankind,
(which comprehend all Religion) to clash
one with the other: Because the Magistrate
cannot promote the Honour of God by using
Force on all he judges to have wrong Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in Matters of meer Religion, without
acting (as has been already proved) contrary
to the Good of Mankind. But God's Laws
are so far from being inconsistent, that there's
so perfect an Agreement and Connection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, that the breaking one is the
breaking all: Nay, the Love of God, and of
our Neighbour, do so evidently imply or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
each other, that they are in effect the same.
For as our loving God is so absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to our well-being, that without it we
should be the most miserable of all Creatures;
so our loving our Neighbour (which includes
all those Duties we owe one another) is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to our loving God: <hi>For if a Man say, I
love God, and hateth his Brother, he is a Liar:
For he that loveth not his Brother whom he has
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51550:28"/>
seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?
1 John</hi> 4. 20. And it's impossible we should
honour God more, than by making our Love
as extensive as all Mankind; because by it we
imitate him whose tender Mercies are over all
his Works, and who designs that all Men,
what-ever their Opinions are, should live in
Love and Peace, (Rom. 12. 18. <hi>As much as lieth
in you, live peaceably with all Men</hi>) it being the
only way to promote our mutual Happiness,
which is the reason we are requir'd to believe
in, and honour God. For he who is infinitely
happy in himself, and consequently incapable
of receiving any Satisfaction or Dissatisfaction
from his Creatures, could have no Motive in
requiring any thing from us, but as it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
tends to promote our general Good; and
therefore we can do nothing more agreeable
to his Will, than to use one another as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires:
Nay, so infinitely great is the Love of
God, that lest we should fail to be happy
here, he has made our temporal Good (which
can only be procured by observing those Rules
he has prescribed us) the Means to obtain our
Eternal. Hence it is that Love, which <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no ill to his Neighbour,</hi> is the fulfilling of
the Law; and Charity is preferred before all
Vertues, even Faith it self, which (<hi>Jam. 2.
20.) without good Works is dead,</hi> and is no
better than the Faith of Devils. But the
Faith of a Persecutor is not only without
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51550:29"/>
good Works, but the greatest Incendiary that
can be to ill Ones, since nothing can qualify a
Man to do so much Mischief, as believing he
does God Service therein; therefore his Belief
is worse than Atheism, or no Faith at all.
That Faith that must save us, is that which
works by Love; but his Faith destroys his
Love. The Apostle <hi>James</hi> (Chap. 1. v. 27.)
tells us, <hi>Pure Religion, and undefiled before God
and the Father, is this, To visit the Fatherless and
Widows in their Affliction.</hi> But his Religion is
to bring Affliction to Fatherless, and Widows,
and every one else that has a different Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from himself.</p>
               <p>In a word; If it were so great a Crime in
the Jews, that it could not be forgiven in this
World nor the next, to impute the Miracles
our Saviour did, when he went about doing
good, and healing all that were oppressed with
the Devil, not to the Holy Spirit, but to that
of <hi>Beelzebub;</hi> Can it be much less to impute
to the Holy Ghost a Doctrine which destroys
the End and Intent of all natural as well as
revealed Religion, and can serve to no other
End, than to dishonour God, destroy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and confound Mankind? By what
has been said, I think it's plain that nothing
can be more provoking to the Supream Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
of Mankind, than to pervert the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
he has given us of himself for the Good
of his Creatures, to their ruin, and make the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51550:29"/>
Honour of God a Pretence for destroying the
Welfare of Human Societies. Besides,</p>
               <p>5. What can be more absurd, than that in
judging of these <hi>matters</hi> wherein we differ from
Brutes, we should be subject to brutal Force?
which is the highest Indignity that can be put,
not only on Reason, which is the Candle of
the Lord, but upon Religion it self, which is
the highest and most exalted Reason; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon the infinitely rational Nature of
God, which can receive no Satisfaction but in
a Rational Service, which must be free and
spontaneous. Force has only a natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
and therefore can only lawfully be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to cure brutal Passions, where Men act
contrary to their Knowledg, and in defiance
to their Reason; where the Inconveniences
they suffer, may over-balance the Pleasure
they receive in indulging their unlawful Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites.
But he seems to be void of all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
himself, who by Force attempts
to inform the Understanding. If Reasons
and Arguments cannot convince, it's down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Madness to think Fines, Imprisonments,
or Tortures can.</p>
               <p>6. The destroying Men, when the Publick
Good does not require it, on pretence it's
pleasing to God, what is it, but in effect
imagining he delights in Man's Blood, and
Human Sacrifices? And as under the Law
none were to be offered but unspotted and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51550:30"/>
clean Beasts; so here none are to be sacrificed
but pure and undefiled Men, who prefer the
honouring and obeying God according to the
best of their Knowledg, before any worldly
Advantages whatever, even the saving their
own Lives.</p>
               <p>And as the Heathen Priests, amongst the
most brutish and barbarous Nations, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
the sacrificing of Men, not so much to
gratify their Gods, as their own Ambition,
there being no way more effectual to bring a
Man (who otherwise would be in danger to
be mark'd for a Sacrifice) into perfect Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
so the Christian Priests (who have
given the World as little reason to suspect
their neglecting any Means that make for
their Advantage) promoted the sacrificing
the Peoples Lives and Properties much upon
the same account: For they having obtained
the Direction of the Sword, made it fall, with
unparallel'd Cruelty, on all that opposed or
(by a Separation) disowned their usurped
Powers and Jurisdictions; by which means
they made the People (on whom they impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
what Doctrines they thought fit) abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Slaves, and Magistrates no better than
their Executioners, who durst not refuse to
put their Sentences in force.</p>
               <p>7. It may be said, That the Magistrate
when he deprives People of their Lives or
Properties, does not offer them as a Sacrifice to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51550:30"/>
God, but as God's Vicar in Spirituals, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes
his Wrath on those that offend him.</p>
               <p>But if it be the Magistrate's Duty to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
those Offences that relate meerly to God,
it cannot be presumed but that God has suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
qualified him for that Employ; which
how can it be, whilst he is incapable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
not only the greatest part of the Actions,
but all the Thoughts of Men, in which alone
consists by far the greater part of the Offences
against him?</p>
               <p>Nay, to qualify the Magistrate for this
Employ, 'tis not sufficient he knows the
present, but it's necessary he should discern
the future Thoughts of Men, and how God
himself will deal with them: for if God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of punishing, will highly reward those
that come in at the Eleventh, as well as at the
first Hour, it would be unjust in the Substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
to punish, where the Principal (for whose
Sake alone he punisheth) will not only pardon,
but highly reward. But,</p>
               <p>8. This is so far from being so, that the
Magistrate is obliged to punish, not only those
that will be, but those that are actually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
in the Sight of God; otherwise he
could punish no Criminal at all, because there's
none but will pretend he has truly repented of
his Crime, and consequently is wholly inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
in the sight of God. And the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
being no Discerner of Hearts, could pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51550:31"/>
none for fear of punishing such a One,
had he not a Right to punish those who with
respect to God are entirely Innocent; so <hi>vice
versa,</hi> had he not a Power to forgive those that
in relation to God are as Nocent, it would not
be in his Power to forgive any one. Nay,
the Magistrate may justly be the Occasion,
even of the Death, not only of those that
have repented of their Crimes, but even of
Innocent Persons, as he is by forcing his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Subjects into the Wars, where it's una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
but Numbers must be slain; and in
attacking Ships and Towns of Enemies, where
Children that never offended either God or
Man, are very often destroyed; and this
without any Fault in the Magistrate, because
protecting the Common-Wealth being his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensible
Duty, any lesser Good, in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
with that, ought to be looked upon <hi>sub
ratione Mali.</hi> All which sufficiently shows,
that the only thing he concerns himself with as
Magistrate, is the Good of the Society; and
that he rewards and punishes his Subjects only
as it tends to this End, without respect to
their being either Innocent or Nocent in the
Sight of God; and that when he punishes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Sin, he does it not as it's a Sin against God,
but as it's prejudicial to the Society; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
he does not act as God's Deputy in
punishing Offences meerly as they relate to
him. But to make this (if it be possible) more
plain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:51550:31"/>
10. The Magistrate, as he has no Right, so
he pretends to none to punish for things that
are owned by all to be notorious Offences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God, and where Men cannot plead
Conscience to justify themselves, such as Pride,
Ambition, Ingratitude, breach of Promise,
Lying, Uncharitableness, Envy, Ill-nature,
Covetousness, Prodigality; or indeed any
thing else that does not invade the Right of
others, or is consistent with the Welfare of
the Society. And if it be unreasonable that
he should harass Men about these things,
(which have some relation to the Civil Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
tho not sufficient to erect Courts of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature
about them) is it not much more so to
molest them about nice Controversies, Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
Points, meer Ceremonies or Forms of
outward Worship, in which the Interest of
the Society is not at all concerned?</p>
               <p>In a word; If the Magistrate is to punish
for some things in Religion, and not for others,
what other Rule can there be to know what
belongs to his Jurisdiction, and what not,
but that about those things of Religion which
relate to the Civil Society, he is to use the
Force of the Society, and that what do not,
ought wholly to be left to God and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
concerned? For as it's absurd that the
Force of the Society should be imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
things that do not belong to it; so it's
very unjust that a Man should not be suffered
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51550:32"/>
to act as he judgeth best in those things,
wherein no other has an Interest, but his own
eternal Good or Ill is only concerned.</p>
               <p>11. God, who does not require of Men
to be infallible, but to do their best to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
Truth, can never be supposed to be
willing that they should be punished for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Error: But the Magistrate, who by
reason of the infinite Variety of Mens Parts
and Apprehensions, does not know what Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
are invincible, and what not, cannot but
punish unjustly, since he cannot tell whether
the Person he punisheth (supposing him in an
Error) is in a Fault; or if in a Fault, cannot
know what degrees of Weakness or Wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
it has, or how to proportion his Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
according to the different Abilities of
every individual Person; which he ought to
do, since where much is given, much is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired;
and where little is given, as little is
required: But as he is not capable of doing
this, so he cannot tell after he has done his
best, but that he has made them guilty of a
much greater Fault than what he pretends to
correct, by forcing them to act against their
Consciences. All which no less than demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
that the Magistrate is not qualified,
and therefore not ordained to punish such Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
but that they are to be left to the Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
of Hearts, the great and righteous Judg
of all Men, who alone discerns all the Powers
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51550:32"/>
and Workings of Mens Minds, when they
sincerely seek after Truth, or by what (if by
any) Default they miss it; and who alone
knows whom to punish, and how to propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
his Punishments.</p>
               <p>12. To suppose God has constituted the
Supream Powers to judg, not only concerning
Civil Crimes, (for which he has sufficiently
qualified them) but also meerly Religious
Ones, is inconsistent with the Justice, as well
as Wisdom and Goodness of God. For if we
cannot suppose so very unjust and foolish a
thing of a King on Earth, as that he should
constitute for his Vicegerents, those of whom
he certainly knew not one in a thousand but
would punish his Faithful Subjects, and that
for no other Reason but because they were so,
and reward those that were not so; How then
can we suppose so very absurd a thing of the
King of Kings, that he should appoint them
for his Vicars in spiritual Matters, and arm
them with a Coercive Power to punish those
Offences that relate solely to himself, who (as
he could not but infallibly foreknow) would
make use of their Power, to encourage even
their rebelling against him, by setting up of
false Gods in his stead? for Idolatry was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where quickly the Publick Religion of their
Dominions, except amongst God's own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
the Jews; and even there very often it
was the National Religion. And after their
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51550:33"/>
Captivity until <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Time, not one of
God's (supposed) Vicars in Matters of meer
Religion, but were themselves Idolaters, and
did all of them discountenance, and several of
them persecute the Worshippers of the true
God: And when the Christians (if Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
deserve that Name) made use of Force
upon Christians, what did it produce but Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Superstition and Idolatry?</p>
               <p>13. Persecution is so far from being a
Means to promote the true Religion, that it
must necessarily hinder its progress, because
the Infidels must think themselves as much
obliged to hinder the preaching of the Gospel
amongst them, as the Christians their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
here: And in vain do we pray for their
Conversion, whilst we assert such a Doctrine
as will not let us suffer them to live here in
order to their Conversion, nor them to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
us to preach the Gospel there. But this is
not all, for had this Doctrine of promoting
the true Religion by Force been believed by
the Heathen, it would have obliged them to
have extirpated the Christian Religion; and
certainly that can scarce be thought to be a
Christian Doctrine, which if practised, would
have destroy'd the very Name of <hi>Christian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>14. It may be said, no Persecution could
extirpate the Christian Religion, because the
severest Methods were so far from destroying
it, that they were the Occasion of its encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the faster.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:51550:33"/>
Not to mention if this were so, and the
Magistrate was to persecute, it ought to be
the true Religion, because it's the way to
make it increase, and by Parity of Reason use
a contrary Method with false Religions; I
say that Persecution, if it continues but a short
time, will make any Religion to increase and
flourish the more, because the Bravery, the
Courage of those that suffer, prepares People
to have a good Opinion of the Cause they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for: But if it continue for an Age, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
so that the old Professors are all destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the succeeding Generations will all be of
the Religion they are educated in. Thus we
find Christianity, by the continued Cruelty of
its Enemies, rooted out of the greatest Part
of <hi>Africa,</hi> and other Places it entirely pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed.</p>
               <p>And should the Persecution in <hi>France</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
the next Generation would be all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
as they are in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal:</hi> So
that the Reason why Persecution had not the
like Effect under the Pagan Emperors, was,
because God did not permit it to continue long
at a time, and not without great intermissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But had all those Emperors been for
promoting by Force, what according to their
Sentiments was the true Religion, they had
utterly extirpated the very Name of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:51550:34"/>
15. Nay, had the Heathen Emperors ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd
Persecution, (as all but what were
Monsters did) yet they had been under an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensible
Duty, as they valued the Peace
and Welfare of Mankind in general, and of
their Subjects in particular, to root out a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which when it got Power into its
Hands, would have no other measure of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Equity than its own Interest, and
would deprive Men, tho never so strict Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the Laws of Morality, and the Society,
of their Properties, and even Lives, (as the
Christian Emperors did) for acting according
to their Consciences. And the Heathens, who
in spight of their Religious Differences, culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
Peace and Friendship amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
could not but have a just Indignation
for a Religion that (had Compulsion been a
part of it) brought with it so many horrid
Consequences, which were sufficient to make
them not only reject it as contrary to the
Light of Nature, but to treat the Professors of
it as publick Enemies of Mankind; who, like
Vipers, could make no other return to those
that nourish them, but the sooner to sting
them. And it's for the sake of this Doctrin,
that the Christians, instead of propagating
their Religion, have been so cruelly persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of late Years in several Places: As in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi>
where it's evident they were not so ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously
dealt with upon account of any aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51550:34"/>
the Japoneses had to the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
for they suffered it quietly a good while
to grow amongst them, who were not so zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for a Uniformity, since they had seven
or eight Sects as different, as the Mortality and
Immortality of the Soul: No, it was the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and Practices of the persecuting Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
that made them believe the Christian
Religion was dangerous and destructive to
Human Societies.</p>
               <p>16. Were the Magistrate ordained by God
to punish for Matters meerly Religious, the
Heathen Persecutors, supposing they acted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the best of their Skill, were no
more to be condemned for punishing the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
than a Judg is, when he acts according
to the best of his Knowledg, in punishing an
innocent Person. All that can be said they
were faulty in, was, their being governed by
the Prejudices of their Education, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
by their Priests, and not suffering the
Christians, before they condemned them, fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to represent their Religion, nor themselves
impartially to consider it.</p>
               <p>If this were the sole Crime of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Persecutors, I am afraid the Christian
ones are as much influenced by their Priests,
or prejudiced by their Education, and do as
little as they freely permit Men, before they
condemn them, to propose their Opinions,
back them with their Reasons, and answer
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51550:35"/>
the Objections of their Adversaries, that they
may impartially judg whether they ought to
receive or reject them: And if it be their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
so to judg, all their Subjects ought to do the
same; which is inconsistent with their hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any by Penalties, from instructing them in
those Opinions, and the Reasons and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that make for them. If the Magistrate
without thus examining should condemn
Men for professing even an erroneous Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that would no more justify him, than it
would a Judg that condemns a Man, without
hearing his Defence; or a Person that swears
a thing to be true, without knowing whether
it be so or no.</p>
               <p>17. Those Matters about which Christians
persecute one another, are generally such as
neither tend to the Honour of God, nor the
Good of Man, and at the best are but Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
to Religion, and withal so perplext, my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious
and uncertain, that Men of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Learning, Judgment, and Probity, are
strangely divided in their Opinions about
them; and consequently they will not admit
of such Proof, as in Justice and Equity ought
to subject a Man to Punishment; for there
should be as much certainty and evidence
that the Matter one is condemned for, is a
Crime, as that he is guilty of it: But can the
Magistrate be as sure (supposing a meer Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
to be a Crime) that not only his Subjects
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51550:35"/>
are in an Error, but himself in the Right; as he
is, that the causless punishing them is Injustice
and Tyranny? But could he be as certain, yet
that depends either upon Criticism in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Tongues, and Skill in the Customs and
Ways of speaking in use amongst the Jews,
or in distinguishing between genuine and spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Readings, or upon Metaphysicks, School-Divinity,
Fathers, Councils, Church History,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the Supream Powers have neither
inclination nor leasure to study and examine;
and consequently they cannot but act most
tyrannically in making Laws for condemning
whole Parties of Men at a venture, for things
that, for ought they know, may be true, and
which they do not think worth their while to
examine: And yet to see them act contrary to
their known indispensible Duty in ruining
their Subjects about such Points, is strangely
unaccountable: All that can be said, is, <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Reges, plectuntur Achivi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>18. To prevent the Magistrate's intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
God has expresly declared, That he will
have the Tares and Wheat grow together un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the Harvest, or Day of Judgment, where
the Angels are the Reapers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, lest the Wheat be rooted up with the
Tares; which relates not to Civil, but only to
Matters meerly Religious, where Men gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
(so grosly do they mistake) root up the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51550:36"/>
Wheat instead of the Tares; and the same
Reason will hold, not only against the root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up, but any ways molesting them.</p>
               <p>The Magistrate ought to render to God
those things which belong to him, as well
as claim to himself what is <hi>Cesar</hi>'s Due; but
if he assumes an Absolute (<hi>viz.</hi> a Legislative
and Coercive) Power in Matters wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to God, he leaves nothing to him, but
usurps his peculiar and inseparable Power and
Jurisdiction, and is as much guilty of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
against the King of Heaven, as a private
Person in assuming a Sovereign Power over
his fellow Subjects, is guilty of Treason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his King: and it will no more excuse
the Magistrate, if he whom he punisheth
should have committed an Offence against
God, than it would the other, if his fellow
Subjects had broke the Law of the Land: But
the Infinite inequality that is between the
King of Kings and a King on Earth, must
strangely aggravate the Magistrate's Crime.
If God wanted either Skill to judg, or
Power to punish those Offences that concern
himself only, there might be some colour for
the over-officiousness of the Magistrate, if
uncommissioned and uncalled for, he offers his
infallible Judgment and almighty Arm; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
there can be no Reason, as <hi>Grotius (de
jur. Bell. &amp; Pac.</hi> C. 30. l. 2.) observes, <hi>Cur non
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51550:36"/>
talia delicta Deo relinquantur punienda, qui ad
ea noscenda est sapientissimus, ad expendenda ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quissimus,
ad vindicanda potentissimus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this I take is sufficient to show that the
Magistrate has not only no Right to a Coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive
Power in Matters meerly Religious, but
that such a Power is directly contrary to the
Honour of God, and most destructive of Mens
Eternal and Temporal Happiness, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the greatest and most comprehensive
of all Sins whatever. But because this is a
Point of so great a Consequence to Mankind,
I will most impartially examine the Reasons
and Arguments (how frivolous soever they
are) that the Defenders of Persecution urge
in its behalf.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>I Having offered several, and (if I flatter
not my self) concluding Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Magistrate's using Force in
other Matters than those relating to the
Civil Society, I shall now examine with all
impartiality, the Reasons that are urged in
behalf of the contrary Opinion, from Divine
and Human Authority, and from Reason: But
first as to Divine Authority.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>All that can be urged from the New
Testament, with the least colour of Reason,
is contained in</hi> Rom. 13. <hi>where it's said,</hi> Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
are not a Terror to good Works, but to the
Evil: Wilt thou not be afraid of the Powers?
do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise
of the same. If thou dost that which is evil,
be afraid; for he beareth not the Sword in vain.
<hi>Where, say they, by Evil and Good Works, not
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51550:37"/>
only those Actions that relate to the Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
but those that are meerly Religious are
meant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To make this out, they ought to prove,</p>
               <p>(1.) That meer Errors of the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
are evil Works: So that those who act
justly in all Matters of a Civil Nature, and in
all others according to the best of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
are evil Doers.</p>
               <p>(2.) That the Apostle means such here,
which ought fully to be proved, because with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it the Magistrate's Jurisdiction is not to be
presumed, much less Penal Laws to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p>But not to mention, that they whose Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
are no wise prejudicial to others, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
for the sake of those Opinions termed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors
or evil Doers, it's clear from the Text,
that Evil and Good Works there spoken of,
relate only to Civil Matters; because other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the latter Part will not consist with the
former, where it's said, <hi>If thou wilt not fear
the Power, do good, and thou shalt have praise
of the same:</hi> Which, supposing Good and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
relate to Matters simply Religious, was
so far from being true, that they were at that
time persecuted for doing Good, and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in doing Evil; and consequently the
Apostle's Reasoning would be so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Argument (as he here intends it) for
the Christians paying Obedience and Tribute
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51550:38"/>
to the Powers in being, that it would have
been a good one to the contrary, since they
bore the Sword worse than in vain, being only
a Terror to good Works, and were not God's
but the Devil's Ministers, attending continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
upon this very thing.</p>
               <p>The Primitive Christians (it's certain)
would have been loth it should have been
taken in this Sense, since it would have given an
unanswerable Argument to <hi>Nero</hi> (to whom
the Apostle here requires Obedience) and the
other Emperors, for punishing Christians, who
according to their Notions, taking Evil in this
Sense, were the most evil Doers.</p>
               <p>2. As to the Old Testament, that's positive,
say they, that the Magistrate ought to punish
for Idolatry, (which is no Injury to the State,
but an Offence simply Religious) and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
has a Right to use Force in those Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
For <hi>Job</hi> (Chap. 31. 28.) speaking of
Idolatry, saith, <hi>This were an Iniquity to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
by the Judg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to give no other Answer, it appears
from the very Prints of our Bibles, that <hi>to be
punished by the</hi> is not in the Original, which
only saith, <hi>For this might be accounted to me an
Iniquity;</hi> and agreeable to the Hebrew the
Septuagint renders it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
It's an easy thing to have
Proofs, if Men when they cannot find them
are resolved to make them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:51550:38"/>
3. But they further add, That if by the
Jewish Law Idolaters, and those that denied
the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> were to be put to death; by
the same Reason Christians, who ought not
to be less zealous for the Honour of God,
should destroy all Idolaters and Blasphemers.</p>
               <p>I answer; The Jewish Laws oblige no
Nation but that of <hi>Israel,</hi> to whom alone
they were given: And if any of these Laws
are now obligatory, it's not because they were
commanded them, but as they are Parts of the
Law of Nature; for there were several things
requir'd under the Jewish Oeconomy, which
are so far from being now Obligatory, that
they are utterly unlawful. Therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that a thing which was binding to the
Jews, is so to the Christians, it ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be part of the Law of Nature, or at
least that they are under the very same Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances;
and there can be no reason why
it should hold in one Case, and not in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>But whoever considers this Point, will
quickly perceive as vast a difference as can be:
For the Jewish Common-Wealth being a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Theocracy, God himself was their King,
and as such he gave them their whole Body of
Politick Laws, with no other Sanction but
what was Civil, <hi>viz.</hi> Temporal Rewards and
Punishments; and did himself judicially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
Controversies of Legal Rights, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51550:39"/>
other Matters of Moment: So that he was
not to be considered by them only simply as
he was the Creator of all Men, but as their
King, the Laws established concerning the
Worshipping of one God, being the Civil
Law of the Nation, and a Fundamental of
their Constitution: So that none could be a
Member of that Common-Wealth, without
owning the God that brought them out of the
Land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and they that revolted from
him, by disowning him for their God, (it
being impossible to own him for their King,
and yet disown him for their God) were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
against as Traitors and Rebels: So
that such a manifest Revolt no-wise consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with his Kingship, there was an absolute
necessity that all Idolatry should be rooted out
of God's peculiar Kingdom, the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi>
And that it was for this Reason, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from this one Consideration, because in
all other Places where the Jews extended their
Conquests, none were put to death, nor pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
for their Idolatry, tho it were manifest
all were guilty of it; it reached only to the
Members of the Jewish Common-Wealth,
who as they were free People upon their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> so it was not without their
express Consent (<hi>Exod.</hi> 19.) that God became
their King; and consequently for disowning
him, they were most justly treated as Rebels
and Traitors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:51550:39"/>
But Christ, as he had no Civil Power him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
so he did not establish those Precepts he
was to deliver with any Temporal Sanctions.
But as those of the Law were meerly Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
so those of the Gospel are purely Eternal;
<hi>He that does this shall live, and he that does it
not shall be damned:</hi> Yea, Christ was so far
from bestowing a Temporal <hi>Canaan</hi> on his
Disciples, that he foretold they should <hi>suffer
Persecution for his sake.</hi> And he, when his
Disciples urged a Precedent from the Jewish
Dispensation to oblige him to destroy, severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rebuked them, saying, <hi>Ye know not what
Spirit you are of; for the Son of Man is not
come to destroy, but to save Mens Lives:</hi> Which
is far from being true, if Men are to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with Death for Idolatry, or material
Blasphemy; for then the Christians would
think themselves obliged to destroy the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and other Heathens for Idolatry, in own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more Gods than own, and all Jews and
Turks for Blasphemy, in denying more than
one to be God: And the Protestants the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
for worshipping a bit of Bread; and
the Papists them for blaspheming their breaden
God: And the different Parties of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians,
not only the Antitrinitarians, but
each the other, since they condemn one the
other of either Idolatry or Blasphemy.</p>
               <p>But this is so far from being true, that the
Gospel expresly requires the Christians so to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51550:40"/>
walk in Wisdom towards those without, that
they give offence neither to Jew nor Gentile;
and is so far from justifying any violent Means
against them, that it requires we should not
only allow them the narrow Measure of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
but that Charity, Liberality, and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
must be superadded; <hi>we must do good, not
only to the Houshold of Faith, but to all Men.</hi>
And if this be the Method the Gospel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
Christians should observe to Infidels, it
cannot be presumed they ought to treat one
another less kindly for lesser Differences. And
when the first Christians differed amongst
themselves about the observation of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical
Rites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was not
so much concerned about the Controversies
themselves, as that they might not be the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of any Uncharitableness, Unkindness,
Variance and Strife; therefore he frequently
recommends to them Love and Peace in the
most passionate Terms, and tells them, they
must deal with one another in the Spirit of
Meekness, bear one anothers Burdens, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they could not fulfil the Law of Christ:
And that we cannot walk worthy of our Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
whereunto we are called, but with all
lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering,
forbearing one another in Love: And it's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the Unity of the Spirit, the Bond
of Peace, Love and Concord, cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
but by the Rule the Apostle gives,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51550:40"/>
that the Strong should bear with the Weak, and
the Weak not judg the Strong; and that every
one is to be fully perswaded in his own Mind,
and not to judg his Brother, but to leave him
to the Judgment of God; and the Reason he
gives is, because it's a Matter that does not
belong to his Judgment, but to God's, and a
Man's own Conscience: For what art thou,
O Man, that judgeth the Servant of another?
to his own Master he standeth or falleth. And
according to these Directions we find that the
Apostle is so far from requiring the Gentile
Church to excommunicate the Jewish for
following their Superstition, (tho it did in a
manner make void the Death of Christ) that
he orders the Gentiles to deny themselves in
several things, rather than give an Offence to
their weak Brethren.</p>
               <p>This way of managing Controversies ought
to have been the Measure by which the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Ages of the Church (whether the
Civil Magistrate was a Member of it or not)
ought to have formed themselves. And when
the Apostle, who had an infallible Assistance,
thought fit to treat of these Matters in such
an obliging Method, as the only way to
maintain Christian Charity, and to lead Men
into the Knowledg of the Truth; those who
cannot pretend to such a Direction, but are
as subject to be mistaken as those they
differ from, ought not imperiously to dictate,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51550:41"/>
much less urge the Magistrate to force their
Dictates on the Consciences of their Brethren,
whom <hi>tho weak</hi> they <hi>are to receive,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In a word; For the Magistrate to pretend
to have a Right upon an Ecclesiastical Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
as Head of the Church, to punish Men
because they are either Schismaticks, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
or Infidels, is to punish them for that
very Reason for which he has nothing to do
with them, because the Churches Power
wholly consisting in putting Men out of her
Communion, has nothing to do to judg those
that are without, and consequently cannot
authorize the Magistrate to use them ill: and
indeed he is so far from having such a Right
upon his being a Christian, that the Apostle
declares, that the Weapons of our Christian
Warfare are not Carnal, but Spiritual; and
the using of Violence he makes the Mark of a
carnal and reprobate Mind; for it's he that is
born after the Flesh, that persecutes him that's
born after the Spirit: But for such a one to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute,
is impossible, because the Fruits of the
Spirit are Love, Joy, Peace, Long-suffering,
Gentleness, Meekness, which are certainly
inconsistent with the Spirit of Persecution;
which where it prevails, destroys the Fruits
of the Spirit; for it's naturally as impossible
to love Persecutors, as Persecution and the fear
of Retaliation, makes Men hate those they
ill use, as much as those they are ill used by.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:51550:41"/>
5. To evade the almost innumerable Texts
that are levelled against Persecution, and show
after what manner we are to deal with those
who differ in their Sentiments from us, it's
said, they concern private Christians only, but
do not hinder them from using contrary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
when the Magistrate requires them.</p>
               <p>But how can the Magistrate, by becoming
subject to Christ's Laws, have a Right to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
his Subjects to act directly against them?
No, those Gospel-Rules are eternally Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
as being built, not only on the general
Good of Mankind (the only Foundation of
all those Duties Men owe one another) but
upon the Honour of God; and therefore they
that would rather obey God than Man, ought
to be no ways instrumental in putting any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting
Laws in Execution, which are null
and void in themselves, as being contrary to
the Laws of God: and the Magistrate, and
all that assist him in depriving any of their
Lives or Properties on this account, are as guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Murder and Robbery, as if they should
serve Men so for not committing Perjury, or
any other Crime, that is both against the
Honour of God, and the Good of Man. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
this Supposition renders the Christians,
especially with respect to the Heathens, most
vile and scandalous Hypocrites, in being kind
and obliging to them only, when they could
not well help it; but no sooner were their
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51550:42"/>
Circumstances changed, but the Disguise is to
be thrown off, and all their former most en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing
Rules are to be laid aside; and the poor
Pagans, who before were to be used so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
are to be stript, not only of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
but even of their Lives.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Arguments from Humane Authority, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT's said, That the Christians ever since
they had Power in their Hands, have not
only punished Blasphemers, and common
Swearers, but the Erroneous, whether in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith or Discipline.</p>
               <p>1. If by Blasphemers they mean those that
are guilty of formal Blasphemy, it's nothing
to the purpose; because the Interest of the
Society requires that they should be punished,
as well as Atheists, and that for the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
too; which also requires that common
Swearers, (who can no more pretend Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
than Blasphemers or Atheists) should be
restrained by Penalties, because otherwise
Oaths which are the Bonds of Humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
will have but small Force on those who
by frequent swearing, run the risque of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51550:42"/>
them daily, and beside give a pernicious
Example to others.</p>
               <p>But if Men out of Conscience worship false
Gods, and are thereby guilty of what is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>material Blasphemy,</hi> the reason for punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them wholly ceaseth, for Force cannot
convince, but only make them false to their
Consciences; and they that are so, will never
be true to the Publick: therefore the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
is so far from having a Right to hinder
them from honouring those false Gods, that he
ought to punish those, who whilst they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to worship them, do dishonour them by
Blasphemy, Perjury, or any other manifest
Contempt; nay, God himself will punish
such Contempts as if done to himself, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
will punish the Magistrate for
hindering them from worshipping those false
Gods, when they believe them to be true
Ones.</p>
               <p>2. But as to Christian Magistrates punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for Matters wherein Conscientious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
may and do differ, it shows their great
Wickedness and Impiety in acting contrary to
the Light of Nature, and those Precepts and
Practices of Christ and his Apostles; and (if
there be any weight in meer Human Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
I may add contrary to the Sentiments of
the Primitive Church for the first three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Years; who we do not find but were all
unanimous in condemning the use of Force in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51550:43"/>
Matters of Religion; and had they been of
another Opinion, nothing could be more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
than those frequent Addresses they made
to the Heathen for Liberty of Conscience:
For then they could not deny that it was the
Duty of the Heathen Magistrate, as long as
they rejected what he judged to be the true
Religion, to punish them; nor could they urge
any thing for themselves, but a shameless beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the thing in dispute, which the Magistrate
(the proper Judg) had determin'd against
them. And to hear them acknowledge, that
were the Power in their Hands, they were
oblig'd to serve them after the same manner,
could not but encourage the Heathen in their
Persecution. But they were so far from hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any such Thoughts, that even when the
Empire became Christian, the very Heathen
Worship (as the Bishop of <hi>Sarum</hi> observes
in his most excellent Preface to <hi>Lactantius</hi>)
was not only tolerated for a whole Age toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but the Heathens continued to be in the
chief Employments of the Empire.</p>
               <p>3. Compulsion was not only against the
Sense of the Primitive Christians, but the rest
of Mankind: for tho the Differences amongst
them were more in Number, and wider than
those amongst the Christians, yet we do not
find that they used Force to compel one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>Socrates</hi> (it's true) was put to death
for his Religion; but were not the People
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51550:43"/>
(tho still averse to his Principles) as soon as
their Fury was abated, sensible of the Crime
they had committed, and of the Injury done
him? Therefore to make him what Amends
they could, they erected a Statue to his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and most of those that set them on were
so abhorred, that this, together with their
own Remorse, made them become their own
Executioners. But what the Sense of the
Heathen was about this Matter, cannot be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
known than from the Sentiments of <hi>Gallio,</hi>
the Town-Clerk of <hi>Ephesus, Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix,</hi>
in the <hi>Acts of the Apostles.</hi> Nay so zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Assertors of Liberty of Conscience were
the Heathens, that we find <hi>Themistius</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Philosophers using all their Eloquence to
perswade the Christian Emperors to give Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to the different Sects of Christians,
whilst at the same time the Bishops were urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to persecute their Brethren.</p>
               <p>If the Heathens would have persecuted any,
it would have been the Jewish Nation, whose
Religion they most disliked; yet we do not
find they were so used by the various Masters
they were under, from their first being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
unto Foreigners, until the Destruction of
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and their being no longer a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but by the mad <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who at last
grievously lamented that Crime. Nay, <hi>Nero</hi>
himself, the first Persecutor of Christians, durst
not do it bare-fac'd, but pretended they were
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51550:44"/>
Incendiaries, and set <hi>Rome</hi> on fire, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were to be punished as Enemies to the
State: And it was their being so represented,
that was more than any thing else the Cause
of their Sufferings. For <hi>Trajan,</hi> as soon as
he perceived that they were Innocent, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed
no Laws of the Empire, but those
that forbad their Worship, straight command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that they should be no longer enquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And <hi>Adrian,</hi> under severe Penalties, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
any to accuse them: The same did <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus
Pius.</hi> And <hi>Aurelius</hi> went further, and
made it Death to inform against them. Nay,
<hi>Commodus</hi> himself, as great a Tyrant as he was
otherwise, enacted the same most just Law;
so that it was then no less than a Capital
Crime to cause any to be molested upon the
Account of Religion, tho supposed never so
false.</p>
               <p>4. Nay, I think I may add, that Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
act not only contrary to the Sense of
Mankind, but their own Sentiments: for ask
any of them, why the swift and sudden En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of the Mahometan Religion should not
be as good an Argument for its Truth, as 'tis
for that of the Christians; they straightway
answer, That maugre its swift Progress, 'tis
little less than a Demonstration of its Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
that it has the Character of Persecution
annexed to it, and made use of Violence as a
lawful Means for its promotion. Which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51550:44"/>
of theirs shows, that themselves believe
Force an unlawful Means of promoting Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
for how else can that be an Argument
of the Falseness of any Religion, if it be a
Means ordained by God to promote the True?
And therefore the Mahometans may justly
say, How can the Christians condemn them
for using that Method, which themselves, as
soon as they get Power into their Hands, (and
the Mahometans could do it no sooner) pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
with far greater Cruelty, even one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the other? Thus they give occasion for
the Enemies of the Christian Religion to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
and that so much the more confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by how much less Christians suffer under
them for Religion, than they do under one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
               <p>5. Nay I may go further and add, that
there's no Party of Christians but what have,
ever since Persecution has been in use, expresly
condemned it, and have writ in defence of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Conscience. And tho the Orthodox
made use of Persecution as well as the Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
yet they not only condemn'd it, but
thought it so very odious, that they supposed
it as great a Crime as they could brand their
Adversaries with. And <hi>Athanasius, in Epist.
ad Solit.</hi> saith, <hi>Persecution alone is a manifest
Proof that they (the Arians) have neither Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
nor the fear of God: For,</hi> adds he, <hi>it's
essential to Piety, not to force any in imitation
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51550:45"/>
of our Saviour; it's the Devil that comes with
violent Means.</hi> And the Synod of <hi>Alexandria</hi>
condemns all Force in Religion, and reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
the Arians as the Inventers and Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of it. It's strange they should be so very
forgetful, as not to mind that the Nicene Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
over-perswaded <hi>Constantine,</hi> contrary to
his Faith given in a Publick Edict for Liberty
of Worship, not only to deprive and banish
those of the Clergy that professed Arianism,
but even to put all Men to death on whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of <hi>Arius</hi> his Works were found.</p>
               <p>6. But it may be said, That if the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Priests in the first General Council, and
all ever since, have been for Persecution, there
must be some very good Reason to influence
them.</p>
               <p>I answer; Just as much as influences the
Jewish Priests not to own Jesus to be the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias:
For as they were prejudiced against him,
because he did not come to advance their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Power, so the Christian Priests have
been as much prejudiced against those Gospel-Methods
of Love, Gentleness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as being
wholly inconsistent with their Pride, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that Dominion over Conscience they
so much affected; as is manifest by their own
Histories, which represent them after such a
manner ever since Persecution prevailed, as one
would imagine he was reading a Story of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
rather than of the Successors of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51550:45"/>
But if there is Confusion, and every
evil Work, where Envying and Strife is, it's
no wonder these should prevail in the highest
manner, when Barbarity and Cruelty are su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded.
And not only Ecclesiastical Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but the best of the Clergy, almost as soon
as Persecution was in use, give a very scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Character of their Body; as St. <hi>Jerom,</hi>
St. <hi>Basil,</hi> St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> who in his
Comment on the <hi>Psalms,</hi> scruples not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them to the Scribes and Pharisees; and
St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> who in his first Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
amongst other things, saith, <hi>They are no
better than Scribes and Pharisees;</hi> that they
looked on the Priesthood, not as a Ministry of
which they must give an Account, but as a
Magistracy which is liable to no examination;
that no Charity was observed in them, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Anger and Passion; that their Piety did only
consist in condemning the Impiety of other
Men, whose Conduct they observed, not to
reclaim, but to defame; that they blamed or
praised Men, not because of their good or bad
Life, but according to the Party they embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
that they admired in themselves what
they sharply censured in another Party; that
they wrangled about Trifles, on the specious
Pretences of defending the Faith; that they
were abhorred by the Heathen, and despised
by all good Men among the Christians.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:51550:46"/>
7. In a word; There can be no Argument
from Human Authority for Persecution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that destroys any Argument that's built
upon Authority, even in the Judgment of the
Persecutors themselves: For ask them why
the Council of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> which was double
in number to that of <hi>Nice,</hi> and which even
the Nicene Fathers themselves subscribed, is
not of any Authority; the Answer is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were not a Free Council, but were
over-awed by the Emperor. But if Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
destroyed their Authority, the Reason
will hold against any other Council or Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Men ever since Force has been in fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And it's no wonder that the Nicene Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
who were so divided into Parties and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and full of Heats, Fewds, and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
(as <hi>Marvel</hi> in that small, but admirable
Essay of Creeds and Councils fully shows)
should revenge themselves on their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
on pretence of advancing the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
or that the Arians, when they had been
so provoked, should serve them after the same
manner; or that the different Parties after
these Precedents, which must necessarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
their Hatreds and Animosities, should
be more and more for persecuting one the
other. But more than enough of Human Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
And,</p>
               <p>Now I shall examine what they urge from
Reason, for the Magistrate's using Force:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51550:46"/>
Which may be concluded under these three
Heads. 1. That it causeth People impartially
to consider the Arguments and Motives that
make for the true Religion. 2. That it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the Propagation of Errors. 3. That the
Interest of the Common-Wealth obligeth the
Magistrate not to permit different Professions
of Religion.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Object. That Compulsion tends to make
People impartially consider, examined.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. I Agree with them, that nothing can
be more agreeable to the Dignity, and
more apparently the Duty of Rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs,
than to make a strict Inquisition, in their
advanced and capable Years, into Matters of
Religion; and that of all the Uses Reason was
designed for, the chief, no doubt, was in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to our Eternal Happiness: But how can
we expect that Happiness from the Hand of
God, if what we are to believe or practise be
by meer accident, or for the sake of Worldly
Interest, and not the Effects of our own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
and Reasoning? for God will judg us
as we are Rational Creatures, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
our Rewards from him will be in a just
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51550:47"/>
Proportion to the use we make of our Reason.</p>
               <p>This being premised, it's evident nothing
can well be a greater Crime than to hinder
People from a free Exercise of their Reason in
Matters of Religion, which, I say, nothing
can more effectually do than Punishments and
Rewards: For what can bias and prejudice
more than Punishments on the one hand, and
on the other not only Protection, but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of Preferment and Advantages? for as
much weight as they carry in Mens Minds, so
much will they be influenced by them. And
to put Discountenance and Punishment in one
Scale, and Impunity and Preferment in the
other, is as likely a way to make a Man judg
impartially for himself, as it is to bribe and
threaten a Judg to make him judg so for others.</p>
               <p>In a word; What can be more absurd, than
to suppose, that the way to make Men consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
calmly, and without prejudice of those
things that require their utmost attention, is
to provoke them to Passion by ill usage, and
to distract them on one hand by the Terrors
of Punishment, and to agitate them as strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on the other by the hopes of worldly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments?</p>
               <p>2. It's usually said, Men are careless and
negligent, and of themselves unapt to make a
strict Inquisition into Religion; therefore are
to be forced.</p>
               <p>But Force will make them but more so, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51550:47"/>
instead of remedying, encrease the Malady:
for Men will then be afraid to examine the
Magistrate's Religion for fear of finding
it false, and any other for fear of finding
it true; both which will equally subject them
to Punishment. In such Circumstances if
they examine at all, it will be very slightly
and partially: for a small, a very small Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
will make most Men profess a Religion
on which their worldly Happiness depends;
and it must be a monstrous one indeed, that
they will not make a shift to own, rather than
be all their lives subject to Punishment. In
short; What can be more unnatural than to
imagine, that to terrify People into this or
that Perswasion, is a more likely way to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them to examine impartially the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Perswasions, than to let them freely exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
and as freely profess what upon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
they are perswaded is the Truth?</p>
               <p>3. If Men ought to be influenced in the
choice of their Religion by no other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
than that of their Eternal Happiness,
what right can the Magistrate have to make
them do otherwise by the Awes and Bribes
of this World? To pretend to establish a
Church by Penal Laws, is inconsistent with
the very Nature of it, because it's essential to
a Church to be a voluntary Society, that meet
for no other Intent than to serve God as they
think most agreeable to his Will. If Men
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51550:48"/>
therefore associate not for this Consideration,
but because of Penal Laws, they may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
any thing sooner than a Church.</p>
               <p>4. If worldly Awes and Bribes were away,
there could be little or nothing to prejudice
Men in their grand Choice; Education would
not then make half so deep an Impression:
For it's Persecution that's the Occasion that
People of different Perswasions contract so
early and so great an Aversion one for the
other, that it becomes in a manner part of
their Nature; and makes it so very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to perswade them to hear, with to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
Patience, what their Adversaries have
to offer: but were they taught to have that
Love and Kindness which is due from different
Sects to each other, and instead of being
frightned from, were heartily advised to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
and impartially consider other Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
besides those they were bred in, Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
could create little or no Prejudice in Mens
Minds; who when they found themselves in
an Error, (as, what thinking Men do not
discover some imbibed in their greener Years?)
would then as freely leave them for the sake
of their Souls, as they do now their Diet or
Physick, when they judg the Health of their
Bodies requires it; nor would others then be
more disturbed or concerned at the one than
at the other: I am sure there is more reason
to change in one Case than in the other, since
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51550:48"/>
the professing an Opinion one believes to be
false, is so far from doing him good, that that
alone turns it to rank Poison; which is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in Physick, where a Man may be cured
by a Medicine he has no Faith in. By what
has been said, it's evident that Force is so far
from causing People impartially to consider,
that it can only serve either to prejudice them
as they become capable of judging, or else
when they have chosen, make them act against
their Judgments.</p>
               <p>5. But it's urged; That when the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
is of the true Religion himself, his using
Force will contribute to make others to be so,
by causing them to consider (since it's their
Interest so to do) the Reasons and Arguments
that make for the true Religion.</p>
               <p>That the Magistrate's using Force when
he is of the true Religion, tends to make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
profess it, there is no doubt; but that it
is by making them impartially consider, ought
not to be taken for granted, since we find it as
effectual to make them imbrace a false as a
true Religion, (else the French Tyrant had
not forced above a Million to turn Papists);
and therefore by how much the Number of
the Erroneous Magistrates is greater than of
the Orthodox, by so much more it causeth
the Profession of false Perswasions: And if
we should judg what may, by what has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
happened, not only before but since
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51550:49"/>
Christ's coming, it's as probable that all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
may use Force to promote Error, as
that any one should do it to propagate Truth.
It's absurd to suppose Persecution makes Men
impartially consider, because they generally
look on it as so just a Prejudice against any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
that useth it, that it tempts them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any further looking into it, to conclude it
wants Reason to support it self, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Professors of it have recourse to bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Force to uphold it; and the way that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors
take to make Men hate their Persons,
is a very improper way to take off the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
they have to their Opinions; and as Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
prejudices them against the Religion
that causeth it, so it strangely endears to
them the Religion for which they suffer, and
makes them apt to think, nothing but the
Grace of God could cause them to adhere so
firmly to their Religion, and apply to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the Prophecies that foretel the Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of true Believers. And in such a Case
it's almost impossible to convince them they
have suffered for being in the wrong. And,</p>
               <p>7. As to the Spectators, it will be very apt
to produce the same Effects, and fill them with
Horror and Indignation against the Principles
of such Men as go about to ruin innocent
Persons for serving God according to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and make them judg as favourably of
the Sufferers; for there's a natural Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51550:49"/>
that follows all in Misery, which creates
likeness of Affection, and this very often like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Perswasion, especially when they suppose
the Sufferers would not expose themselves to
those Punishments, which by a Compliance
they might easily avoid, were they not fully
convinced of the Truth of their Opinions.
And it's very probable that the Quakers (to
give no other Instance) had not been so very
numerous, had not the Sufferings, which they
generally bore with more than ordinary Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
created in many of the by-standers, not
only an Aversion for the Church that persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, but a very great Esteem of them,
and by degrees of their Opinions.</p>
               <p>8. That violent and rough Methods are not
the way to make prejudiced Persons imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
consider, is evident from the contrary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
that all Men take when they endeavour
to perswade: And they are but little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with Mankind, who do not know how
absolutely necessary it is for a Man, by all insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating
ways, to ingratiate himself with those
he endeavours to perswade, especially if it be
of the falseness of an Opinion they have a
long time imbibed. Nay, I desire no body to
go further than his own Breast for an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whether ever Violence gained any thing
on his Opinion; or whether Arguments ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
but with Heat, did not lose some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of their Efficacy, and have not made
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51550:50"/>
him even the more obstinate in his Opinion: So
much concern'd is Human Nature to preserve
the Liberty of that Part wherein lies the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Man, which could it be imposed on by
Force, would make him but very little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from a Beast. The properest Means to
maintain any thing, are those that first made
it grow: if therefore the Gospel had owed
its first Encrease and Progress to Force, that
had been still the best Means to support it;
but since it was nursed, and grew up by fair
Means, they must be the fittest to preserve
it. The Apostles, in conquering the almost
invincible Prejudices of the Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
made use of all those endearing Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
that are so directly opposite to Force.
And St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the great Converter of the
Gentiles, <hi>became all things to all Men, that he
might gain some.</hi> And he tells <hi>Timothy,</hi> That
<hi>the Servant of the Lord must not strive, but
must be gentle to all Men, apt to teach, patient,
in meekness instructing those that oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
if God will peradenture give them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
to the acknowledging of the Truth.</hi>
And if this be the way to make even the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
acknowledg the Truth, the contrary
Method can but the more prejudice and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
them; and they must not be the Servants
of the Lord, but of another Master, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
practise it themselves, or what is as bad,
endeavour to perswade others to use it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:51550:50"/>
It's said, that the Apostles could work on
Peoples Prejudices and Passions by Miracles,
and that therefore they had no occasion for
Force. But if whilst they had the Power of
doing Miracles, they were obliged to make
use of all those endearing Arts to gain on the
Affections of those they designed to proselite,
there is much more reason now to do it, and
even to double the natural Means, when the
supernatural Ones have ceased, as the only
way that remains to cause Men to hear and
consider.</p>
               <p>The contrary Method is so unlikely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
such an Effect, that I believe there can be
no Instance given of any Man being sincerely
brought over by it to embrace any Religion;
tho, no doubt, there have been several, who
when they have been forced to profess a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
contrary to their Consciences, have at
last made a shift (so natural is it for Men to
love their present Ease) to stifle the Checks
of their Consciences, and at last to believe it:
But this is evidently wicked, because it's doing
a real Evil, on pretence that Good may come
of it.</p>
               <p>9. It has been all along the Pretence of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors,
to justify their Cruelty, that those
they punished were obstinate and perverse,
and would not impartially consider. Upon
this Head <hi>Antiochus</hi> (as <hi>Josephus</hi> in his <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Reason</hi> tells us) put to Death great
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51550:51"/>
numbers of the Jews, because they were so
obstinate to refuse what he judged an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
thing, the eating Swines Flesh: And on
the same Pretence of Obstinacy, <hi>Pliny (Epist.
2. l.</hi> 10.) murdered a great many Christians.
And the Christian Persecutors have all along
made use of the same Plea to persecute their
Brethren. This is the chief Argument the
French Clergy used for Dragooning of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants:
And the main Topick of our late Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors
was, that the Dissenters were obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and peevish, in not complying in things
they judged indifferent. If such Reasoners are
in earnest, it shews the height of Pride, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
and Self-conceit, in supposing their
Reason the Standard of all others; and that
none can differ from them, without being guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a most criminal Inconsideration. In a
word; Since the Magistrate cannot know
whether a Man has or has not impartially
considered, to punish him upon that Account
is manifestly to usurp that Authority that can
belong only to the Discerner of Hearts: The
most he can pretend to, (were this Matter
under his Cognisance) is to oblige those he
thinks have not impartially considered, to read
the Reasons, or hear unprejudiced and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Persons argue the Matter on both Sides;
any thing more than this is evident Injustice,
and is nothing else than endeavouring to make
Men act against their Consciences.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:51550:51"/>
10. Another thing Persecutors agree in
is, an Endeavour to disguise their Cruelty
in the softest Terms imaginable, which
shews that the thing it self is so very odious,
that themselves are ashamed of it. The
Inquisitors, when they deliver over to the
Secular Magistrate those they condemn
to be burnt, they intreat him after this
manner;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Domine Judex rogamus vos cum omni af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectu
quo possimus, ut amore Dei, pietatis, &amp;
misericordiae intuitu, &amp; nostrorum interventu
precaminum, miserrimo huic nullum mortis vel
mutilationis periculum inferatis.</hi> And the
French Tormentors, tho they highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the Cruelty of the Inquisition, yet
they as much extol their own good-natur'd
Tyrant for reclaiming Hereticks by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
full of Mercy, Gentleness, and Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
And our late Persecutors, tho they
abhorred the Devilish Cruelty of the French
Dragooners, yet they greatly magnified the
Moderation and Gentleness of the Penal
Laws, and wondred any should be so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous
as to dislike them; which yet,
with submission, equalled, if not exceeded
those of <hi>France</hi> they so much exclaimed
against. To mention no other than those
made in the 23, 27, and 35 of <hi>Elizabeth;</hi>
which indeed are so very moderate, that
they extend only to the loss of Estate, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51550:52"/>
Liberty and Life. And Bp <hi>Burnet,</hi> in
his Preface to <hi>Lactantius,</hi> very justly tells
those Hypocrites, that they let themselves
loose to the Rage of a mad Persecution;
and adds, (a most charitable Advice) That
they ought seriously to profess their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of this Fury, in Instances that may be
as visible and legible, as their Rage has been
publick and destructive.</p>
               <p>But since the Protestants are forced to
condemn the Severities the Papists use, they
have no way to justify their own Penalties,
but by pretending they are so very gentle
and moderate, that they will not have those
ill Effects the others produce; that is, they
will not cause Men to play the Hypocrites,
nor prejudice or bias their Judgments, nor
even destroy their Charity, by causing them
to hate their Persecutors. But,</p>
               <p>Punishment may be reckoned severe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon the Account of the Length or
Greatness of it.</p>
               <p>11. As to the first; If a Man is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
all his Life under any Punishment, tho
in it self but moderate; or which is all one,
can see no hopes of Redress, without ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Soul, that Punishment is certainly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere.
And since Men are not always alike
upon their Guard, but the World is more
apt to make an Impression at one time than
at another, there is a very great Danger,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51550:52"/>
that some time or other they may be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to free themselves by a guilty Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
Who was more ready to lay down his
Life for our Saviour, than St. <hi>Peter?</hi> Yet
his Zeal was not constant, for we find him
capable of Fear to the last degree, so as to
deny his Master with Oaths and Curses,
when there was no other Punishment for
those that believed in Christ, but turning
them out of the Synagogue. Nay, at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time, he shamefully complied with the
Jews to the drawing aside of many; and
this at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where the Jews had no Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Power. And if so great a Person could
be so easily wrought on, who can be secure
when he lieth under constant Temptations?
And he who considers, that of the twelve
Disciples one denied his Master for fear, and
another denied him for a paltry Sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
will not wonder that Punishments and
Rewards, tho not excessive, may have too
great an Influence on others.</p>
               <p>As to the second; Perpetual Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and little less than Outlawry, which
are the inseparable Consequences of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
are severe in themselves, as well
as upon the Account of the Length of them,
which can scarce fail some time or other so
to affect Men, as to make them desire their
Liberty, tho at the Price of their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
And yet your Protestant Persecutors,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51550:53"/>
for all their Pretences to Moderation, would
be as loth as the Papists their Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
should be without them.</p>
               <p>As to punishing People in their Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
considering the almost infinite Variety
of Mens Circumstances, there can scarce be
any Fines or Mulcts so small, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
paying of them must ruin great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and be grievous to many more. There's
nothing can well be more moderate, than
the Price that Christians pay for Liberty of
Conscience under the Mahometans; yet to
avoid that, great Numbers of them turn
Mussulmen.</p>
               <p>In a word; There is no such thing as
Moderate Penalties in any persecuting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Country: And considering Mens
Tempers, how much sooner some than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will be wrought on by Punishment, or
losing some temporal Advantage, it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to say what degree of Force will
not make some act against their Conscience,
and prejudice others in their choice of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and destroy the Charity of most,
since there's no where that Brotherly Love
and Friendship between different Sects,
where Persecution prevails, as the Gospel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
or as there is where they tolerate
one another. And where there is a Man
whom Force will not cause to act against his
Conscience, or prejudice his Judgment, or
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51550:53"/>
destroy his Charity, it cannot be presumed
but that the Thoughts of future Rewards
and Punishments have made so religious a
Person impartially consider; so that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
him, tho but moderately, would be
very unjust.</p>
               <p>12. And yet if the Magistrate has a
Right to use Force, to make People profess
what Religion he judgeth to be true, that
degree of Force ought to be used that is
most effectual to that End, because where
the End is a Duty, the Means that are most
conducive to it must be so too. Now it's
evident, a greater Degree will cause Men to
profess, where a less will not; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the greater Degree will have the
greatest Effect. Besides, what can the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
do if Men will still go on in a constant
Defiance to his Laws, to assert Opinions he
judgeth do dishonour God, or not assert o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that do honour him? must he not at
last come to capital Punishments, except he
will see God continually dishonoured? And
if meer Opinions are of that fatal Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to the Souls of Men, (as Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
pretend) it's the highest Charity that
can be, to destroy all Promoters of such
pernicious Opinions; for is it not better that
a few (and those too hated of God) should
be cut off, rather than they should destroy
the Souls of a great many, (for who knows
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51550:54"/>
where such Opinions will stop?) not only of
the present, but of succeeding Generations?
so that here's no room for Clemency: For
how can the Life of a Man counterpoise
the loss of a Soul? And since nothing can,
at least so certainly, root out such Opinions,
as putting the Professors of them to Death,
is it not the highest Charity to the Souls of
others to serve them so? Nay, it's more for
the Safety and Interest of a Nation, that a
few should be destroyed upon the Account
of Religion, than that great Numbers by
lesser Punishments, which suffers them to
encrease, should be grieved and provoked;
which must necessarily create Disturbances,
Tumults, Wars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, such proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
will be the occasion of the Death of
more People; as it was here in the late Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions,
where more were starved, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
died in noisom Prisons, than what
are destroyed in the like Proportion of Time,
where the Inquisition is established. And
how little it's able to bring People to a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
may be judged from <hi>Charles</hi> the
First's Time, where the Church was so
far from rooting out the different Sects by
Punishments, and those too not very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
that those Methods were the Ruin of
the persecuting Church; so that in respect
of the good of Men, as well as the Honour
of God, all Sectaries, if they are not to be
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51550:54"/>
set wholly at Liberty, are to be quite rooted
out, for all middle Ways are both absurd
and unsafe.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Object. That the Magistrate has a Right
to use Force, to prevent the Increase of
those Erroneous Opinions that a Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
would produce.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF Force prevents Men from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
into Errors,<note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> it must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it hinders Men from freely and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
examining Matters of Religion; which
if Men would as freely do where Force is
used, as where 'tis not, it could no ways
hinder the supposed encrease of Errors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the not using it does no wise blind, nor
the using it enlighten Mens Understandings.
And as Error, where impartial Diligence
is used, is wholly innocent; so where it's
neglected, the accidental stumbling on Truth
will not justify or excuse the neglect of it:
Therefore if it should tend to hinder Error,
by preventing Men from impartially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering,
it would not give the Magistrate
a Right to use Force. But how can Force,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51550:55"/>
in the Hands of Men as liable to be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
as those they use it on, contribute to
hinder Mens falling into Error? There may
perhaps be more Errors in a Country where
there is Liberty of Conscience, but not more
in Error, because it's more than probable,
(as I shall fully prove hereafter) that
where Persecution prevails, they are all una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
in the Wrong. But where will the
Magistrate, using Force, prevent Errors? on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in that Place where the Persecutor's parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Sect is established; in all other Places
it will as much serve to promote and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talize
them: So that except the Persecutor
can find out a way that only his Sect shall
use Force, he cannot deny but that there
are at least a thousand Arguments to one,
even upon this Head, against the use of
it. But,</p>
               <p>2. A free Permission from the Pulpit, or
Press, for Men of different Opinions to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
their Reasons to the People, that they
may search into them in order to discern
the Truth, is so far from being the way to
maintain and propagate Falshood, that it's
the only way to destroy it; except we will
say, That tho God has given us Faculties to
judg of Truth and Falshood, and has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
us to make use of them in order to
find the Truth, yet the more we do so, the
further we shall be from discovering it. To
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51550:55"/>
hinder Men from doing this, on pretence
they would be led into Error by it, what is
it but to make our selves wiser than God,
and in effect to say, he is mistaken in the
Method he has proposed to us for our disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the Truth? Therefore, say the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors,
let us keep the People in Ignorance
of any Opinion but our own, for fear lest
when they come to understand the different
Opinions, and the Reasons that make for
one side as well as the other, they should be
unqualified to judg of them.</p>
               <p>3. It may be said, Upon supposition of
this Liberty, Opinions, tho never so absurd,
may be published. But if every one is to
judg for himself, he ought not to rely upon
another's Judgment, but examine himself
whether they are so or not; and it's proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that they that are against this Freedom,
maintain such Opinions: for the more they
are afraid of having their Opinions examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the more absurd it's likely they are;
and the more any Opinion is grounded in
Reason, the more willing the Professors of
it are to have it undergo the Test; it's only
those with flaws in them, that (like crackt
Titles) cannot bear a Scrutiny. If the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans</hi>
were for ever enobled by St. <hi>Paul</hi> for
not relying on what he said, (tho he had the
Power of Miracles to confirm his Doctrin)
but for trying whether those things he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51550:56"/>
were so or not; there's certainly as
much reason now to do it, otherwise we
are Slaves where we ought to be most free,
in our noblest Part, our Understanding:
And if in all other Matters, the more any
thing is scanned, the more the strength of
those Reasons appears that make for Truth, as
well as the weakness of those that are plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in behalf of Error; Why should it not
be so in Matters of Religion, since we must
judg of their Truth and Falshood, as we do
of all other things, by their Agreement or
Disagreement with our common Notions,
especially considering Religion is no obscure
and unintelligible thing, but so plain and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy,
that it's suted to the Capacity of the
Simple and Ignorant, the Bulk of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind?</p>
               <p>It's to me wondrous strange, that any
should have so ill an Opinion of the Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableness
of the true Religion, or else of
the Impotency of those Rational Faculties
God has given Men on purpose to judg of
Religion, as to suppose they would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it (were they not prejudiced by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Motives) before the Inventions of
Men.</p>
               <p>It's said, the Affectation of Singularity
and Novelty is apt to cause a Man (if the
Magistrate by Force does not restrain him)
to wander from the true Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:51550:56"/>
But what Charms can there be, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thought not only ignorant and mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
but also despised and hated, as he
too certainly is, that differs in his Sentiments
from his Neighbours? And therefore it's not
only a sign that a Man thinks of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
but that he is very hearty and sincere
in it, when he exposeth himself to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Disgrace and Disrepute by it; for
there's not one of a thousand that's stiff and
insensible enough to bear the perpetual dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of his Neighbours, and those he is
forc'd to converse with: And therefore
there's no need of Force to make Men
profess the Publick Religion, which (for no
other Reason but because it is so) they are
too apt to do. Hence it is, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Careless and Negligent, but the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral
and Vicious, are generally of the
Religion established by Law, where they
can best indulge their Vices, as having the
Countenance of the People, and the Favour
and Indulgence of the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>5. Another Argument they usually urge
is, that Mens Lusts and Passions would
make them prefer false Religions before the
true, had not the Magistrate a Right to
hinder them by Force. But not to mention,
that since the Magistrates are as much go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned,
as their Subjects can be supposed to
be, by their Lusts and Passions, Force in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51550:57"/>
their Hands will more likely promote than
hinder false Religions; I answer, As to the
meerly religious, or speculative Points of
the true Religion, Mens Lusts or Passions,
since these are no way concerned how those
are held, do not encline them to prefer Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
before Truth. And as for those Parts
of Religion wherein Mens Lusts and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
may be supposed to sway them, those
I own (as far forth as my Adversaries) do
belong to the Magistrate's Jurisdiction,
and all Men, for the sake of their common
Good, are obliged to get them believed and
practised; for it's equally the Interest of
Governours and Governed, to embrace the
true Religion, contrived by the infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God for the Benefit of Mankind:
For God, as he could not envy his Creatures
any Enjoyment they are capable of, so he
has forbad them nothing but what naturally
tends to their Ruin and Destruction; and
were it not for Persecution, and those Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
supported by it, which interested Men
have tack'd to the Christian Religion,
there can be no doubt but that it had long
before now been the Universal Profession of
Mankind.</p>
               <p>6. As a free and impartial Liberty is the
only way to promote Truth, so where Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
prevails, it's morally impossible
but that Error, Ignorance, aud Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51550:57"/>
must do so too; because Men when
they are hindred from exercising their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
by being forced blindly to follow
the Opinions of others, become ignorant
and superstitious, and are apt to take any
absurd Impressions: And the Priests them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
where they are sure of the Force of
the Magistrate to make People profess what
they please, will not much trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
about Reasons and Arguments; and
consequently by degrees grow very ignorant
and superstitious, as we find it in <hi>Spain,
Italy, Portugal,</hi> and other Popish Places
where the Inquisition is settled; tho in
<hi>France</hi> (where till of late more Liberty has
been allowed) they have not for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
been so grosly ignorant. It's very
true what a late Author observes, That the
Ministry is more learned, more diligent,
and more exemplary, where a Government
carries it self equally to the different Parties,
than if one Party being absolute Masters,
should therefore (so much is Human Frailty
more apt to be corrupted by Prosperity
than by all other Snares together) abandon
it self to Licentiousness, Ignorance, Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Superstition. And this holds not
only in Popish but Protestant Countries; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in which the less there is of Liberty, the
more Error, Ignorance, and Superstition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:51550:58"/>
7. Besides, when Men shall be hindred
from professing any Doctrin but what the
Priests in their Convocations shall decree,
will not these be tempted to establish such
Opinions as shall tend to promote their own
Power and Dominion, tho to the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of true Piety? And this is no strange Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
considering how fond in general
Mankind are to advance their own Power
and Authority. And do not the Protestant
Clergy own that Popery is nothing but a
Politick Design to advance the Power of the
Clergy under the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> tho to
the Ruin of Christianity? But as <hi>Rome</hi> it
self was not built in a Day, so it was not
but by a long, steady and uniform Design
for many Ages, that the Clergy by degrees
arrived to such a Power. And it's suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
evident, that long before the Pope u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped
such Superiority over the rest of the
Clergy, they were carrying on the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of aggrandizing themselves, and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing
over those they call the <hi>Laity.</hi> In a
word; It has been the Pride, Ambition,
and Covetousness of the Priests, and the
Force and Violence that by their Means
and Instigation the persecuting Magistrates
have used on the People to make them pay
a blind Submission to the Decrees of the
Clergy, that has been the Cause, not only
of all the Mischief and Miseries that upon
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51550:58"/>
the account of Religion have happened in
Christendom, but of the great Corruption
of Religion; which being a thing so plain
and easy in it self, and suted to the Capacity
of the People, would never have been so
much and so universally depraved, had
there been an entire Liberty of Conscience:
for tho upon several Accounts, such as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of Education, mistaken Philosophy,
Interest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Errors might have crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church, yet had they not been esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by Penal Laws, there would have
been some in all Ages, who not being under
the like Prejudices, would have opposed
them; and consequently upon a free Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
Error could not long have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the Power of Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> &amp;c. were more success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
than others, (who before them saw
the Corruptions the Clergy had introduced)
only because they had better Fortune in
meeting with Princes that allow'd them a
Liberty that was denied to the others.</p>
               <p>10. One of the chiefest Means of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Religion, was occasioned by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Philosophers, those Pretenders to Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
falsly so called; who when they thought
it worth their while (tho few or none of
them at first were converted) to come into
the Church, and became Governours and
leading Men in it, brought in with them (so
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51550:59"/>
hard it is to conquer the Prejudice of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
their absurd Metaphysical Notions,
wholly inconsistent with the Plainness and
Simplicity of the Gospel, which they
wrested to their preconceived Opinions;
and being then unwilling to make a meaner
Figure, upon the account of their Learning,
than they did formerly, they blended toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two very different things, Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and that vain Philosophy St. <hi>Paul</hi> so
much cautions People against. And they
that succeeded them, made it their Business to
render Religion more and more mysterious
and unintelligible, that the Laity should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
them for their profound Knowledg in
things past their own understanding, and be
wholly governed by them in Matters of
Religion, as being above their Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and so get their Consciences, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
their Estates in their disposal.
Which Design succeeded accordingly, for
we find that it was wholly left to them to
make what Creeds, impose what Opinions
they thought fit on the Laity; who, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they asserted their Natural Right of
judging for themselves, and acting accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that Judgment, were by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate's
Sword (always ready) forc'd to a
Compliance. Thus it was that Priest-craft
began, and Persecution compleated the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
of Religion. And if this was the Method
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51550:59"/>
the Clergy took in the most early Times,
what reason is there to suspect, that in these
latter Times they are less in love with Power
and Dominion?</p>
               <p>9. It's said, That the Magistrate's Force
is necessary to preserve Religion; because
for want of it the World was quickly and
universally overrun with Idolatry.</p>
               <p>I answer; A Right in the Magistrates to
use Force, would in no wise have preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Idolatry, except they had been against
it when the People were inclined to it;
which was so far from being true, that the
Kings themselves (as that great and good
Man, the Author of the Letters concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Toleration,</hi> plainly shows) were the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters
of Idolatry, by introducing their
Predecessors into the Divine Worship of the
People, to secure to themselves, as descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Gods, the greater Veneration
from their Subjects; and therefore erected
such a Worship, and such a Priesthood, as
might awe the seduced Multitude into the
Obedience they desired.</p>
               <p>And it's much more probable, that Courts
by their Instruments the Priests, and by
their Artifices, the Fables of their Gods,
their Mysteries and Oracles, should thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the Honour of their Kings amongst
the People, for the Ends of Ambition and
Power, than that the People should find out
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51550:60"/>
those refined Ways of doing it, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them into Courts for enslaving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
And it's no wonder that Absolute
and Arbitrary Monarchs (as the first Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers
of Idolatry were) could impose
what they pleased on their Subjects, bred up
in Slavery, (and consequently in Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance);
for where Men are poor and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
(the necessary Consequence of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Power) they have no leisure to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
into Matters of Religion, their Time
being wholly taken up in providing necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Subsistence; and consequently they must
be grosly ignorant, and have mean, low,
and abject Thoughts sutable to their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
So that 'tis not strange that these Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
might by degrees impose on them the
worshipping their Ancestors, especially when
they saw the Priests and Courtiers scarce for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
adoring the present Monarch; which
is almost unavoidable in Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
(witness the most fulsome and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
Flatteries that are offered up to the
French King, even by his Christian Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects).
Nay, how many Instances have
we of such Monarchs, whose Impatience
would not permit them to stay till after
their Death for Divine Honours, which
then Custom had in a manner made their
Right? And,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:51550:60"/>
10. One (and not perhaps the least)
Reason why the generality of the Priests
are for preaching up absolute Arbitrary
Power to be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> is, because that
necessarily causes an Universal Ignorance,
and thereby gives them a fair Opportunity
of imposing on the People what they think
fit: For Ignorance, tho it's far from being
the Mother of Devotion to God, it's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
so to the Church, as the Priests call
themselves; and therefore there is nothing
they dread more than a knowing Laity:
and to show all the Arts and Methods they
have taken to keep them ignorant, would
require a large History. And we find that
in those Places where the Clergy are most
numerous, potent and rich, the People are
most ignorant and superstitious, as well as
most enslaved; and where the Clergy are
fewest in Number, Religion abounds most
as well as Knowledg and Liberty. It was
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> and some such barren Places,
which could not well maintain many Priests,
and where it was scarce worth their while
to advance Priest-craft, that best preserved
the Purity of the Gospel. And not to go
so far from home, as nothing made way so
much for the Reformation as the depriving
the Priests of their Monasteries, and other
ill-gotten Goods; so nothing has since con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
more to the continuing of it, than
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51550:61"/>
those Possessions being out of their Hands.
And the Method by which they have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
corrupted Religion, is by wheed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
or forcing the People into a blind Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to what they impose on them. And
it was by these Artifices that the Jewish
Priests and Rabbies imposed on that Nation
the Traditions of Men for the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God. And it's by this Method
that the Mahometan Religion supports it
self, there being no Debate nor Discourse al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of what the Mufties shall teach the
People. And every body knows that the
forcing People into an implicit Faith, is the
Bulwark of the Popish Religion.</p>
               <p>And now having answered, and (I think
I may say) retorted the Arguments for
Compulsion, upon pretence of advancing
the true Religion, I shall next examine
what is said for it upon a Civil Account; but
before I do that, I must beg leave to show,
(since it's for Protestants this Discourse is
chiefly designed)</p>
               <p>First, That this Doctrine of Compulsion
is inconsistent with the very Foundation of
the Protestant Religion. And,</p>
               <p>Secondly, To lay down the true Method,
consonant to Protestant Principles, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
(maugre all the Differences of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions)
not only Schisms and Heresies, but all
Hatred and Uncharitableness, and bringing
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51550:61"/>
People to true Christian Love and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
which will in a manner prevent all
that can be urged for Compulsion upon a
Civil Account.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>That all Force upon the Account of meer
Religion, is inconsistent with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the Protestant Religion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. AS it was Persecution that advanced
Popery, so it was Freedom and
Toleration that ruined it, and established
Protestantism; the Essence of which consists
in every one's having an impartial Right to
judg for himself, and which is the necessary
Consequence of it, acting according to that
Judgment: And therefore, as a very worthy
Person saith, A Persecutor is no where at
Home but at <hi>Rome.</hi> The Papists in perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting,
act consistent with their own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:
But Protestants, whilst they perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
any, condemn themselves. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
pretend there are Doubts and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
in all, even the most important Points
of Religion; and therefore there must be
(say they) some ultimate and external Judg
to appeal to, by whose decisive Judgment
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51550:62"/>
all Persons must be concluded, otherwise so
many Men so many Minds, and the
Church will be filled with Controversy and
Confusion.</p>
               <p>The Protestants on the contrary say,
That God has appointed no such Judg, but
that every one is to judg for himself, and to
act according to that Judgment: And
therefore, since they judged the Terms of
Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
they acted according to their Duty in
separating from it, and in forming Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Assemblies of their own, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to make as many Converts as they
could: And that they were obliged to do
this when the Government was against
them, as well as when it was for them, in
Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Days as well as Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s;
according to the practice of the Primitive
Christians, who held their Religious Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
contrary to the Commands of the
Heathen Government. Grant me these
Principles, or by any other justify the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
if you can, and shew me then
how any Man, or Body of Men, can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to judg for others, and by Force en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to make them profess their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Nay, can the persecuting Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
any otherwise justify themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but by the
very same Arguments their Brethren (who
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51550:62"/>
desire but the same Liberty from them that
they claim from the Papists) make their
Defence with, against whom they can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
no other Reasons than the Papists
use against all of them? than which there
can be nothing more disingenuous. And
what is it but mocking both God and Man,
first to bid Men use their Reason in Matters
of Religion, then punish them if they will
not act contrary to it? To tell them they
must judg for themselves, and act according
to that Judgment, and yet excommunicate,
imprison, and fine them for so doing, is a
most fulsome Contradiction. With what
Face can the Clergy tell their Hearers, that
they ought not to take things on trust, but
impartially examine the Reasons on all sides,
and yet make it their Business to hinder the
preaching or printing of any thing but
what makes for their own Side? The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the <hi>Perswasive</hi> to an ingenuous Trial
of Opinions in Religion saith, (<hi>Pag.</hi> 28.)
<q>They that have a good Cause, need no
disingenuous Arts; they will not fright
Men from considering what their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
say, by denouncing Damnation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them; nor forbid them to read
their Books, but rather encourage them
to do so, that they may see the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between Truth and Error, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Reason and Sophistry, with their
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51550:63"/>
own Eyes. This is the Effect of a well-grounded
Confidence in Truth; and there
is this Sign of a good Cause apparently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable
in the Application of the Clergy
of this Church both to their Friends and
Enemies, they desire the one and the other
to consider impartially what is said for us
and against us: And whatsoever Guides
of a Party do otherwise, they give just
cause to those that follow them to examine
their Doctrines so much the more careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by how much they are more unwilling
to have them examined. It's bad Sign,
when Men are loth to have their Opinions
seen in the Day, but love Darkness rather
than Light.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Whether this last does not agree to that
Church which endeavours to hinder any
thing from being preached or printed that
is not of their own Side, as well as to the
Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> or with what Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
he could make such a Panegyrick on
that Church, whose Persecution in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Book he attempts to justify, let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
judg. And it would be very diverting
(were it not on such a Subject) to observe
the miserable Shifts the Clergy make to
condemn the Practice of the Popish Church,
and at the same time to justify their own,
which, as well as the Papists, claims a Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Coercive Power in Matters of meer
Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:51550:63"/>
2. But they say, The Papists sorbid the
People from reading the Scripture, and
thereby hinder them from judging for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>To which I answer: Which is worse, to
give Men leave, by reading the Scripture,
to judg for themselves, and then use Force
to make them act contrary to their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or to make them follow their Guides
with a blind implicit Faith? The one tends
to make Men ignorant and superstitious,
the other down-right Hypocrites and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains:
if Men were above Force, they
would neither blindly follow their pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Guides, nor act against their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
But however both Papists and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
use the Means that naturally tend to
effect these wicked Ends.</p>
               <p>Besides, I ask these Protestant Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
whether they think the reading of the
Scripture alone, without hearing or read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some learned Men of their Party, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to make them understand the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
Points? If they own they ought to
hear them, why not the opposite Side? If
they were to hear neither, they would be
more likely to form a true Judgment, than
to hear the studied and elaborate Arguments
on one Side only. If the People are not to
be trusted to hear all that can be said on all
Sides, for fear of taking a different Opinion
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51550:64"/>
from the licensed Guides, why shall they
be more trusted with reading the Scriptures,
which they may apprehend in a Sense dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from that of their Guides? except
you say, that as long as these alone have the
interpreting of it, and have the Force of
the Magistrate on their Side, they may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
what Opinion they please on the People.</p>
               <p>In short, did the Priests of any Protestant
Party act consistent with their own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and had a mind that the People should
not blindly follow them, they would be so
far from hindering them (by restraining the
Liberty of the Press and Pulpit) from exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
the Reasonableness of those Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that are contrary to theirs, that they
would make it their Business to perswade
them to it, and obtain an entire Liberty for
their Adversaries to preach and print what
they think good.</p>
               <p>3. It was the Protestant Priests acting
most apparently, and most shamefully incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with themselves, that put a sudden
stop to the Reformation, which at first, like
a mighty Torrent, overturned all that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
it: And here it is that the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> insults, and saith, That the Principles
of the Protestants, by which they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to justify their Separation from her,
are so absurd, that themselves are obliged
to act contrary to them, and do the very
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51550:64"/>
same things they condemn in her. Thus
the Persecution of the Popish Church has
been kept in Countenance by the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
following her Example, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
would have appeared so odious, that
all must have abhorred her for it, or else
obliged her to grant that Liberty which
would infallibly ruin her.</p>
               <p>4. As Persecution was the chief Cause of
hindering the further spreading of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
so to that we must impute that this
was not more perfect and compleat. For
tho the first Reformers deserve very great
Commendation for what they did, yet it
cannot be imagined, that being bred up in
Popish Darkness and Superstition, they
should be able to discern, much less remove
all those Corruptions that had been so long
a gathering, (that could only be the Work
of Time, or Men inspired); and therefore
it's no wonder there were so many different
Opinions amongst them at first. But had
those that succeeded them, instead of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a blind implicit Submission to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
and getting them established by Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Laws, taken the same Liberty in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
their Opinions as the Reformers did
their Predecessors, all Differences, at least of
any moment, would in some Time have
been composed; which became impossible
by the Clergy, being obliged (as they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51550:65"/>
their subsistence) to assert such Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
right or wrong, as were established by
Law, and by Persecution causing such Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities
and Prejudices amongst the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Sects, that instead of examining one
anothers Opinions sincerely and impartially,
they ran daily further into Ignorance, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,
Narrowness and Uncharitableness.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Method to destroy not only Schisms
and Heresies, but Hatred and Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableness
amongst Christians, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
their different Opinions.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUT suppose few or none of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Opinions that are amongst
Protestants, had been composed by their
acting consistent with their own Principles;
yet there could not well be any Divisions or
Schisms amongst them, which do wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
from that Antiprotestant and impious
Practice in imposing on others our own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
and dubious Comments as necessary
Terms of Communion, and requiring Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to profess them on pain of Temporal or
Eternal Punishment; which is nothing less
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51550:65"/>
than making our own Opinions of Divine
Authority, and as necessary to Salvation as
the express words of the Scripture; which
if Men did only make use of in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
Point in the publick Forms of
Worship, they might be of the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
for all their variety of Opinions.
And indeed nothing seems more absurd, than
that instead of the Expressions the infinite
Wisdom of God thought fit to make use
of, Men should be so zealous for imposing
on their Brethren their own Conceits, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of things they confess to be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable,
and their own Explications of
what they acknowledg to be inexplicable,
and their own Reason of what they own is
above their Reason, and their own meaning
of what they confess their Words cannot
reach the meaning.</p>
               <p>But it's no wonder that they that make
themselves wiser than God in contriving
Methods, even opposite to those he requires,
to make Men embrace the Faith, should
think themselves better able to express that
Faith than God himself, and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
those as Hereticks who declare their
Belief in the Terms of Truth, except also
they will admit their Expressions and Terms,
from which it's by no means lawful to vary;
which shows that they put a greater value
on them, than on the Divine Word.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:51550:66"/>
2. To this they say, they oblige People to
use their Expressions in order to discover
Hereticks.</p>
               <p>But if God requires no more of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
than that he believes the Scripture, and
endeavours to find out the true Sense of it,
and to live according to it; he that does
this can be in no fault, but is to all intents
and purposes as safe in respect to his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Happiness as if he were infallible, and
consequently is far from being a Schismatick
or Heretick. Tho the Imposers are not
only Schismaticks, by causing a needless Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
but Hereticks by their own defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of Heresy, which is erring in Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals,
and erring obstinately against
Knowledg; because when they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
the Holy Scriptures to be the only
foundation of Faith, nevertheless they lay
down certain Propositions as Fundamental
that are not in the Scripture; which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
against their own Principles, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
the very Foundation they have
laid: so that instead of finding out others
to be Hereticks, they make themselves such
by requiring a Divine Faith to their own
imagined Deductions; which how clear so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they seem to themselves to be drawn
from Scripture, appear quite contrary to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
If a King going a far Journey, should
give certain Injunctions to his Subjects,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51550:66"/>
and appoint no Judg to determine any Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
that should happen about interpreting
them, but that every one according to the
best of his Skill should judg for himself, and
not act until he was fully perswaded in his
own Mind; Would not they that do this,
how much soever they were mistaken in
interpreting his Injunctions, have done all
that he required? And would not he be
justly enraged at his return to see them, for
doing this, beaten and abused by their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Subjects?
And what Reason therefore
can there be urged why Christ should deal
otherwise, at his return to Judgment, with
your persecuting Heretick Starters, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
those Good and Faithful Servants (the
supposed Hereticks) for following his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
in judging of his Will according to
the best of their Abilities?</p>
               <p>3. If the Predestinarians and Antiprede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinarians,
who condemn one anothers Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
as most impious, may, and ought, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their different Sentiments, to
continue in the same Church; or if the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
can so infinitely differ in Matters of
Faith, that one Party of them shall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
but one Infinite Almighty Being or
Spirit, and another three such, and yet be
of the same Communion, and agree in the
same Terms of Human Invention; Why
may not all (since it's scarce possible any
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51550:67"/>
should differ more widely) join together in
the same Communion, if nothing be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in those Matters wherein they differ,
but in Scripture-expressions, in which they
all agree? And is it not the Imposers, that
not only in the Arminian Controversy
(which has caused a Schism in the Protestant
Countries beyond Sea) but in all others, that
are guilty of the Separation? <q>For I do
not see (as that very Honest and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
Man Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> in his Tract of
Schism, observes) That <hi>Opinionum varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
&amp; Opinantium unitas</hi> are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or that
Men of different Opinions may not hold
Communion <hi>in Sacris,</hi> or both go to the
same Church. Why may not I go, if
occasion requires, to an Arian Church, so
there be no Arianism expressed in their
Liturgy? and were Liturgies and publick
Forms of Service so framed as they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
no particular and private Fancies,
but contained those things in which all
Christians agree, Schisms on Opinions were
utterly vanished.</q> And let me add, that
not only Schisms or Heresies, but all Hatred,
Animosities, and Uncharitableness would
be destroyed: For then the Clergy, since it
would be their common Interest to unite
together, would maintain Peace, Love,
and Kindness amongst themselves, and
preach the same to the People, who would
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51550:67"/>
never, were they but left to themselves,
hate, or molest one another for meerly spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
Opinions (which make but little
impression on them) especially too, when
they did not create any Divisions or Schisms
amongst them; nay, then all Opinions of
Moment (I mean those which Men cannot
neglect examining into without a Fault)
would, being handled without Prejudice or
Passion, quickly be rightly understood; and
those of little or no Moment (which are
chiefly kept up by the Hatred and Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of the different Sects, and the Artifices
of the Priests) soon fall to the Ground. And
this is the sense of the ablest Champion that
the Protestant Religion could ever boast
of, the brave <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> who tells us,
<hi>Ch. 3. n.</hi> 8. <q>If Men would be themselves,
and be content that others should be,
in the choice of their Religion, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of God and not of Men; if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of being zealous Papists, earnest
Calvinists, rigid Lutherans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they
would become themselves, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that others should be plain and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Christians; if all Men would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Scripture, and freeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from Prejudice and Passion, would
sincerely endeavour to find the true Sense
of it, and live according to it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
no more of others than to do so,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51550:68"/>
not refusing their Communion to those
that do so, would so order their Publick
Service of God, that all may, without
Scruple, or Hypocrisy, or Protestation
against any part of it, join with them
in it; who does not see, that seeing all
necessary Truths are plainly and evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
set down in Scripture, there would of
necessity be amongst all Men in all things
necessary Unity of Opinion, and (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any other Differences that are or
could be) Unity of Communion and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and mutual Toleration; by which
Means all Schism and Heresy would be
banished the World, and those wretched
Contentions which now rend and tear in
pieces, not the Coat, but the Members
and Bowels of Christ, with mutual Pride
and Tyranny, would speedily receive a
most blessed Catastrophe.</q> So, <hi>Chap. 4.
n.</hi> 16. <q>This presumptuous imposing of the
Senses of Men upon the Word of God,
the special Senses of Men upon the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Words of God, and laying them on
Mens Consciences, under the equal Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Death and Damnation; this vain
Conceit, that we can speak of the Things
of God, better than the Words of God;
this deifying our own Interpretations,
and tyrannous enforcing them upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
this restraining the Words of God
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51550:68"/>
from that Latitude and Generality, and
the Understanding of Men from their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
where Christ and his Apostles left
them, is and hath been the only Fountain
of all Schisms of the Church; and that
which makes them immortal, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Incendiary of Christendom, <hi>Riden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
Turca, nec dolente Judaeo.</hi> Take away
these Walls of Separation, and all will
quickly be one: Take away this perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting,
burning, cursing, damning of
Men, for not subscribing to the Words
of Men as the Words of God; require
of Christians only to believe Christ, and
to call no Man <hi>Master</hi> but him only:
Let those leave claiming Infallibility, that
have no Title to it; and let them that in
their Words disclaim it, disclaim it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in their Actions. In a word, Take
away Tyranny, which is the Devil's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
to support Errors, Superstitions,
and Impieties, in the several Parts of the
World, which could not otherwise long
withstand the Power of Truth: I say,
take away Tyranny, and restore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
to the just and full Liberty of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating
their Understanding to Scripture
only; and (as Rivers, when they have
a free passage, run all to the Ocean) so
it may well be hoped, by God's Blessing,
that Universal Liberty thus moderated,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51550:69"/>
may quickly reduce Christendom to
Truth and Unity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But to add a greater Authority, even that
of the Apostles themselves; who tho they
were to teach the People the Christian Faith
before they baptized them into it; nay, it's
impossible any should be of the Christian
Church, before he knew the Faith that must
make him a Christian; yet they required no
more of those that before believed the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of God, to qualify them to be Members of
the Church, than to believe Jesus to be the
Christ, and that God has raised him from
the Dead, and the Doctrine of Repentance:
And upon this Belief which all Christians
profess, they constantly admitted both Jews
and Gentiles into the Church; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
whilst this Belief remains, they are
not unqualified to be Members of the
Church, except Men have a Right now-a-days
to disown those for Brethren and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church that the Apostles owned
as such. <q>But They are indeed (as Mr.
<hi>Chillingworth</hi> observeth) the greatest
Schismaticks, who make the Way to
Heaven narrower, the Yoke of Christ
heavier, the Differences of Faith greater
than they were made at the beginning
by Christ and his Apostles; they talk
of Unity, and aim at Tyranny, and
will have Peace with none but their Slaves
and Vassals.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:51550:69"/>
4. But it's said; A Heretick, after two
or three Admonitions, is to be rejected, or
(more properly) avoided; therefore Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of Opinions will hinder Men from
being of the same Communion.</p>
               <p>By a Heretick is not meant one that thrô
the weakness of Understanding is in an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
but an immoral Man that acts against
his Conscience, for the Apostle describes him
as one that's conscious of his Crime, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
condemned of himself, on whom Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
might have a good Effect; or if they
should not be sufficient, yet that the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Disgrace of being shunned by his
Brethren, might reclaim him; which Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
could have no such Effect, if his
Fault had been a meer Error of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding:
And Heresy cannot but be a
Fault of the Will, because it's called <hi>a Work
of the Flesh, and damnable,</hi> which a meer
Error of the Understanding by no means
is: And if the Apostle had meant, that a
simple erroneous Person was to be avoided,
he would have contradicted himself, since
(as it has been already proved) he requires
such a One to be born with.</p>
               <p>5. But it's said, We are bid (<hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17.)
to mark and avoid those that cause Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Offences.</p>
               <p>To which I answer, That bare differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Opinions do not cause them; for what
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51550:70"/>
two Men, even of the same Communion,
agree in all Points of Divinity? No, it's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
that has been the unhappy Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all the Offences, Schisms, Divisions,
and Heresies, that have confounded the
Church. Besides, it's plain, the Apostle does
not speak here of the meerly Erroneous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he says they are those that serve not the
Lord Jesus Christ, but their own Belly; and
<hi>Philip.</hi> 3. where he renews the same Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
he describes them as Enemies of the
Cross of Christ, <hi>Whose end is Destruction,
whose God is their Belly, who mind earthly
Things.</hi> A Character which generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
but too well with those that are for
Imposition, who thereby cause Divisions
and Offences, contrary to the Doctrine the
Apostle taught them.</p>
               <p>If Schism be (as it's pretended) so great
a Crime, that every one that is guilty of it
is out of the ordinary way of Salvation;
what can be more Uncharitable and Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
than to make so many things even of
an indifferent Nature, necessary to Church-Communion,
as tho it were on purpose to
make Schismaticks?</p>
               <p>6. In a word, To be shunned and avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by every one as some Pest or Plague, can
be no small Punishment to so sociable a
Creature as Man; and therefore none ought
to be so punished for an Error of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51550:70"/>
an involuntary thing, and no
Fault at all, when also that Punishment
does not tend to convince him of his Error,
but to make him act against his Conscience,
and to cause Uncharitableness, and most of
those other pernicious Consequences (tho
not in so high a degree) that Force does. In
a word, none can forfeit his Right to the
civil Converse and Familiarity of his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Creatures, so that they shall combine
together to avoid him, but by his being a
Man of no Conscience, or of such Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
as engage him to break those common
Rules which tend to their mutual Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and thereby is become their common
Enemy. And if Christians would not act
against the Light of Nature in doing as
they would not be done unto, they ought
to give to all Men (how different soever
their Religion may be) the same Freedom
of Judging and Acting according to their
Judgment as they would desire from them,
and impose no more on them than they
would be willing to suffer themselves were
they in their Power; and require no more
of their own People who have the same
Rule of Faith, than to endeavour to find
out the true meaning of it, and to live up
to it; and of their Clergy, than their best
Diligence to discover the true Sense of it,
and their Sincerity in instructing others in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:51550:71"/>
7. Without this Freedom it's morally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
but that the Clergy must be the
chief Promoters, not only of Schisms and
Heresies, but of Uncharitableness, Envy,
Strife, Fewds and Factions; since not only
their Interest, but the Method of their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
enclines them thereto. For Men
that are bred in the World, as they every
Day meet with variety of Opinions, so they
can with ease see others differ from them,
and freely give them the same Liberty they
take themselves: On the contrary, they
that are educated (as the Clergy are) in
Cloisters or Colleges, where they come not
to examine the Truth of such Opinions as
are established by Law, but to profess them
as a Trade they are to get their Living
by, and consequently are all as to those
Matters of the same Opinion, when they
come into the World, and set up for Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
they cannot bear so unusual a thing as
the least opposition; whereas were they left
to themselves to examine things in their
own Minds, and after this to profess what
they judg to be Truth; this would teach
them Patience, Modesty, and Humility,
by showing how subject, not only them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but even the most Celebrated are to
be mistaken; and that nothing discovers
Truth like a free and sincere examination;
and consequently they must abhor any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51550:71"/>
to the freedom of judging. That
this different way of Education has as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Effects on the Minds of Men, is so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
evident, that you will scarce find a think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Man but abhors all Imposition, and
every thing that tends to hinder Freedom
and Liberty of judging. On the contrary,
you shall scarce meet with one who has
had a different Method of Education, whose
Reason generally lieth in Authority, and
his Brains in his Common-place Book, that
can bear with any Opposition, but is for
imposing upon others by Force and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
And this proud imperious perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
Spirit betrays it self in all their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
where, without respect to Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or good Manners, they stick at no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
tho never so scurrilous and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
that will but serve to expose and vilify
their Adversaries. And which not a little
adds to this sort of Temper, is the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
and Despotical Government in the
places of their Education; for there is none
so insolent and assuming, so apt to insult
and domineer, when he has an Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as he that has been bred in an absolute
Obedience, and a slavish Compliance: and
Experience shows, that the longer People
have lived in such Places, the readier they
are to fly into Extravagance when they
come abroad into the World; and if they
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51550:72"/>
happen to influence the Counsels of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
they seldom fail to press him on to
illegal Arbitrary Practices, or to practise
the same themselves in those Places of
Power they are advanced to. And the
chief Reason that makes the Regular Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
amongst the Papists so much more for
Persecution and Cruelty than the Secular,
is, because the Government in their Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
is more Tyrannical and Arbitrary than
the others: therefore it behoves all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to take special Care that those Places
where the Youth receive their Learning,
should be, what they are usually called, <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of free and ingenious Education.</hi> But to
return.</p>
               <p>Can it be expected from Men thus edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
that they should by their Precepts
and Examples, perswade those of their
own Party to any Charity and Benignity
for any other Sect that looks on them (as
all Sects do on each other) either as Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
or Hereticks, and endeavours to
perswade all People to do the same? which
strikes not only at the Power and Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
but even the Maintenance the People
bestow on these Priests.</p>
               <p>It's no wonder that in this Case they pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
the People with Hatred and Animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
against all Dissenters, and are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
urging the Magistrate to persecute
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51550:72"/>
them. But it would be as absurd for him
to be governed by them, as it would have
been in the Town-Clerk of <hi>Ephesus</hi> to have
been ruled by <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and the rest of
the Silver-Smiths in punishing <hi>Paul,</hi> whose
Preaching spoiled their Trade.</p>
               <p>8. Did the Clergy but consider the ill Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
that Persecution has all along had on
them, they would not be so zealous for it.
As long as the Emperors had the Power in
their own Hands, there never was a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
but what was an Imperial Machine, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for or against a Trinity, or worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it seemed good, not
to the Holy Ghost, but to those Emperors:
and when the Priests, by their cunning com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
in Matters of Faith, had by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
advanced their own Power above the
Emperors, and the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as
their Head, had the summoning of Councils;
then they were meer Papal Engines, and in
their Synods voted and acted as they were
influenced from the Vatican. But if these
things be too remote, the English History
affords us fresher Examples in the Reigns of
<hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th, Edward</hi> the <hi>6th, Mary</hi> and
<hi>Elizabeth;</hi> how easily and how smoothly
did the Clergy then change their Articles of
Faith, and Forms of Worship, nay eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing, according to the Inclinations of
those Kings and Queens? But we need not
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:51550:73"/>
go so far back for Examples; let us but cast
our Eyes upon the present State of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in every part of Christendom, and we
cannot but see that the Opinions of the
Clergy (as much as they pretend not to
take things on trust) are every where such
as the Terms of Preferment (appointed by
the Laws of each Country) require of
them. Are they not in <hi>Italy,</hi> and in all the
Dominions of <hi>Spain,</hi> zealous and thorow
Roman-Catholicks? In <hi>France</hi> Catholicks,
tho with reserve to the Liberties of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican
Church, and the Regalities? Or rather
are they not whatever that absolute King
will have them to be, as we see by their
acting with the See of <hi>Rome?</hi> And are they
not in one half of <hi>Germany</hi> Papists, in the
other Protestants? In <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
Lutherans, in the <hi>Alps</hi> Calvinists,
<hi>&amp;c.?</hi> This is impossible should so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
happen, if Interest had not too great
an Influence over them, which makes them
very unfit Instruments to find out Truth;
or if found, sincerely to discover it. And
how can they be fit Guides to others, who
are not trusted to guide themselves, but,
right or wrong, are obliged to assert such
Opinions, or else to starve? which certainly
destroys all manner of Argument from their
Authority, since interested Persons are of
no Credit, and therefore are every where
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51550:73"/>
repelled from giving their Testimony.
But,</p>
               <p>9. The Clergy had a quite different De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
by such Imposition, <hi>viz.</hi> To keep the
People in a blind Obedience, and make them
give an implicite Faith to what they so una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously
agree in, whether Con or Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,
or any other such Points;
which has had the designed Effect: for, to
speak the Truth, the great Fault of the
Laity has been in paying a servile and blind
Deference to the Opinions of the Clergy;
or, as Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> in his Tract of Schism,
speaking of the Laity even of the second
Century, expresseth it, <q>Through Sloth and
blind Obedience, they examined not the
things that they were taught, but like
Beasts of Burden, patiently couched down,
and indifferently underwent whatever
their Superiors laid upon them.</q> And thus
much do the Clergy of each Sect object
to the Laity of those Sects they differ
with: and tho the Laity are so much more
numerous, and it's their Business, as well
as the Clergy's, to examine into Matters of
Religion in order to know what they are to
believe or practise; yet if we look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
History, we shall find that most, if not
all, the Errors, Schisms, Heresies, that have
confounded the Christian World, have had
their Origin and chief Support from the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:51550:74"/>
Clergy, and that the Laity have been with
much ado perverted; and as they have held
out longest against false and absurd Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
so they have been always the first and
most forward for a Reformation.</p>
               <p>10. It's to the Clergy's being every where
obliged to defend the established Opinions,
we in a great measure owe that in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of Controversial Points the Words
there used are much more obscure, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and undetermined, than they are even
in ordinary Conversation, by which means
they are enabled to talk eternally in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
or defending any Proposition, tho never
so absurd; for Men may wrangle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
if they affect an Obscurity and an
Uncertainty in the Use of their Words: and
in truth, the whole Learning of the Schools
is only disputing about Words; there a Man
may be furnished with several Words, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Ideas annexed to them; and nothing so
common as Distinctions without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
But it had not been so intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
if this sort of Jargon had been confined
to things meerly speculative, and had not
obscured the material Truths of Law and
Religion, nor invaded the Concernments
of Human Life and Society, bringing
Confusion, Disorder, and Uncertainty into
all Affairs of Moment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:51550:74"/>
But I shall say no more on this Point, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
adding, that it was Imposition, and the
consequence of it, Excommunication for
matters of Opinion, which first brought in
Uncharitableness, Envy, Strifes, Fewds,
Factions amongst Christians; and after that,
Persecution not only heightened them, but
was the occasion of the prodigious encrease
of all other Wickedness, by forcing Men
to break the Ties and Obligations of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
and it's impossible but that all
manner of Immorality must abound whilst
Imposition prevails, which eats out the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Heart and Life of Religion, and at the
best makes Men profess, as a matter of Form,
whatever Opinions they find necessary for
their worldly Convenience. And this I
think is sufficient to show the Execrableness
of it, especially in Protestants, whose Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
it's so inconsistent with.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That the Good of the Society obligeth the
Magistrate to hinder different Professions
of Religion, examin'd.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. AND now I am at leisure to examine
the only remaining Pretence for the
Magistrate's using force in Matters of meer
Religion, that without this Power he
would be destitute of the Means to prevent
Tumults, Disturbances, Commotions, Wars;
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the necessary Consequences of
a Toleration.</p>
               <p>Not to repeat what I have said, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.
§. 22. or <hi>Chapter</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> of the horrible
Mischief of Persecution; nor to mention
that what is so directly contrary to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God, and the Good of Souls (as I
have proved it to be) can no wise contribute
to the Temporal Good of Mankind; I say,
if the professing of any Religion that in
whole or part is different from that esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by Law, will cause these dismal
Effects, then the Protestant Perswasion in
Popish Countries, and the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in those of the Heathen, will produce
them. But if Persecutors cannot affirm this,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51550:75"/>
it's false to say that any Religion, meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it's different from that of the Publick,
tends to create Disturbances; therefore if
they have any value for the true Religion, they
ought not to make use of such an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for Persecution, which will make that
criminal, and subjects its Professors to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution.
And if those wide and many Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
that distinguish the Christian from
all other Religions, will not cause any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
in Heathen Countries; why should
these fewer and minuter Differences that
are among Christians themselves, produce
them in Christian Countries? Mens different
Opinions, in meer Religious things, are no
more apt to create those Effects, than diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Opinions in Philosophical Matters,
which certainly would equally cause Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances,
did Men persecute one another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them; and we see different Opinions
in Religious Matters do not, when Men
for all their different Sentiments are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to continue in the same Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
It's said, 'tis not barely different Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but the Schism and separate Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
caused by those Opinions, that create
Disturbances.</p>
               <p>If Schisms have such Effects, they are in
the fault that by Imposition cause those
Schisms. Yet there's no Reason why Mens
meeting at different Places, with different
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51550:76"/>
Forms and Ways of Worship, should sooner
cause Commotions or Wars, than their
meeting at different Places with the same
Forms and Ways of Worship, did not Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Disadvantages attend one, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
the other. In a word, there are
no Reasons upon the account of any Danger
to the State, which forbid Religious Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
that are open and free to all, and where
Men are so far from Caballing, that they do
not discourse together, but do more strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hold against all Meetings of any other
sort. It's said, those Meetings are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of Persons of the same Opinions; but
being of the same Opinions (except they
are such as are prejudicial to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and those I do not defend) cannot
be of any ill consequence to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But this or any other Argument that
is drawn from what is common to all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Assemblies, will make the Magistrates
own Church as dangerous as any other;
and it can be nothing but the different Usage,
that one is caressed, and the other persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that makes one dangerous, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not. In a word; there can be no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
drawn from the safety of the Society, for
the different Sects of Christians to condemn
the Religious Assemblies of each other,
if they teach nothing that's destructive
to the Civil Society, as seditious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51550:76"/>
and Nurseries of Rebellion, but
what would have justified the Heathen for
treating all Christian Congregations as such.
And if the differences in Opinion, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Sects amongst the Heathens were
far greater than those amongst the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and yet there was no Commotion
upon the Account of Religion, there can be
no Reason but that the Christians, did they
allow the same Liberty, would be as free from
any such Mischief, because as long as each
Sect thinks it their Duty to tolerate others,
no Quarrel can possibly happen upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of a Toleration. <q>It's not therefore
Error (as the Bishop of <hi>Sarum</hi> observes)
or Mens following the Dictates of their
Understandings, that has caused Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances,
and broke the Peace and Order
of their Civil Government, and of the
Church; but the Spirit of Imposing so
commonly found in prevailing Parties:
the Erroneous, as the stronger side think
they may call them, would have been
quiet if they had not been made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
Inquisitions, or other Miseries,
or ill Usage upon the Account of their
Opinions; but when they have cause
given them to fear bad Treatment for a
bare dissent in an Article of Faith, the
natural and most just Principle of Self-preservation
obligeth them to combine
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51550:77"/>
together for their necessary Defence. And
from hence have risen all those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions
that have so violently shaken
Churches and Kingdoms.</q>
               </p>
               <p>2. Seeing this is evidently so, what can
be more disingenuous, as well as wicked,
than to ill use and oppress People, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
render them justly disaffected, and then
make use of that as a Pretence for the
punishing them? If Men in such cases
are disaffected, take away the Cause of it by
forbearing to use them ill (which is a very
easy and natural Remedy) and you take
away all pretension of Dissatisfaction. It
destroys all assurance of Human Affairs to
suppose Men will run the risque of losing
their Lives, or being ruined by a Civil War
upon the Account of Religion, when they
have all the Freedom in Religious Matters
they are capable of. For which unusual Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation,
they will be ever studious to show
a grateful Fidelity, and endeavour by all
Services imaginable to lay up a stock of
Merit, to secure their future Quiet; and the
different Sects, as so many Guardians of the
Publick Peace, will be very watchful over
one another, and do their utmost to discover
and prevent the Designs of any Party
whatever, that would be innovating or
changing the Form of Government, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
by such Alteration they are likely to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51550:77"/>
be losers, and they can hope for nothing
better than what they already enjoy; so
that the more numerous the Sects are, the
safer the Government is like to be.</p>
               <p>3. But on the contrary, where they want
this Liberty, the Publick Peace will never
be secure; for common Interest will oblige
the persecuted Sects (tho never so contrary
in their Principles) to combine together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their Common Enemy: and Men
when they fight for their Religious as well
as Civil Liberties, do it with more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Resolution; and there's scarce any
Party so inconsiderable but what upon some
Emergency or other may endanger a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Therefore it's evident, 'tis the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
Security, as well as Duty, to grant
an impartial inviolable Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
The Truth of what has been said,
sufficiently appears by the different Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of the Dissenters, who (tho widely
differing from one another) did in the time
of Persecution combine together for their
just and necessary Defence against their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors;
yet since they enjoy Liberty of
Conscience, are most entirely Loyal, Hearty,
and Zealous for the Government that grants
it. And it's visible to all that are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
blind, that the quiet and peaceable
Behaviour of the Sectaries, (since each
Party worships God according as they think
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51550:78"/>
best, without endeavouring to molest or
disturb their Neighbours for doing the same)
destroys all the Arguments against Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon the Account of Discord and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances;
and the longer the Toleration
endures, the more Peaceable and Inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
will the different Sects be to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
because by degrees all those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of Animosities and Hatred, that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
did produce, will wear off.</p>
               <p>I believe there can be no Instance where
ever a general and impartial Toleration did
produce any Disturbances and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
much less that there ever was any
Government overturned by an Indifferency
and Impartiality to different Sects; but
when that has happened, it has always been
by a professed Partiality for one side against
the others: For the People will never be so
wholly void of all Humanity and Pity, as
to be pleased to see their Relations, Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and Countreymen barbarously used,
for serving God according to the Dictates of
their Consciences. And there's no Person,
where he has not a direct Interest to the
contrary (as the Body of the People have
not) but would wish that Men had the
choice of serving God as they think best,
rather than that any one Way (even that
which himself at present espouses) should be
forced on them by Penal Laws, because not
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51550:78"/>
only his own, but any of those Magistrates
he may chance to be subject to changing
their Opinions, (neither of which is in his
Power to hinder) must subject him to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment;
beside, the thing in general being
so prejudicial to the Publick, must make
them abhor it: therefore it's Madness to
suppose they are fond of any persecuting
Laws, much less that they will create a
Civil War to obtain them; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
by a Toleration, all colour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is taken away from those that might
be supposed to desire Civil Commotions;
and the more People are used to Liberty of
Conscience, the greater and more irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable
will their dislike be of Imposition,
and consequently will the more heartily
unite in a general abhorrence of Popery as
the grand Promoter of it, and by no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
whatever will be brought to endure
the Thoughts of Popish Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>4. It may be urged, That tho the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of themselves will be content that others
should have the same freedom of judging
for themselves, and acting according to that
Judgment; yet that the Clergy, by the
great Influence they have over them, may
engage them in Commotions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where Men have liberty to examine
what the Priests teach, and dissent from
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51550:79"/>
them, if they think fit, they will never be
able so far to impose on them, as to oblige
them to act so directly contrary to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest:
It's Persecution that chiefly supports
a blind implicit Faith and Obedience, but an
entire Liberty will put a Necessity on the
People (their Guides differing amongst
themselves) of judging and examining for
themselves; and the longer Toleration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues,
the more will they be freed from a
blind implicit Obedience: And in these
Days, where Light and Knowledg does so
much aboud, it's impossible they should
be so grosly imposed on by the Clergy,
whose Conduct, especially in Points relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Interests, have given them too
just an Occasion not to give a blind Assent to
what they affirm. And whoever does but
consider with what Zeal and Fury the Clergy
are for persecuting Men for a dissent in Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
Points, or a Matter of Form, above
what they are in Matters of Vice and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality,
nay, that they are for caressing
even very wicked Persons, if they appear
but zealous for their Interest, will quickly
see it's not a Sense of Religion that hurries
them on, and consequently how little Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
People have to be blindly guided by
them in those Points.</p>
               <p>Besides, the Magistrate may make the
Clergy be for Liberty of Conscience, by not
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51550:79"/>
suffering them to enjoy any Preferment, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they will declare their Abhorrence of
Force in Matters meerly Religious, and
then they will be as much for Liberty as
now they are against it; except we can sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that they will be true to their Interest,
only when that is against the Truth.</p>
               <p>5. On the contrary; Let us suppose the
most favourable that can happen to a perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
Magistrate, that he destroys all Sects
but his own. All that he would get by it,
would be to make himself a Property to
his Priests; to whom then it would be too
late to deny any thing, and who will not fail
to advance such Antichristian Doctrines as
shall exalt them above <hi>all that's called God;</hi>
and make all the Bigotted and Superstitious
(which would then be the greatest part)
of their Side: So that all the Magistrate
would get by persecuting his Subjects,
would be to enslave himself. And what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I pray, was the Effect of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Kings and Emperors persecuting their
Subjects, but to make themselves Vassals to
the Pope the Head, and to the rest of the
Clergy? And had it not been for the Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
(without which a Reformation was
impossible) that was allowed the first Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
they had been daily more and more
enslaved; so that it's owing to those Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
the Popish Magistrates are for extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51550:80"/>
that the Chains are filed off from
their Hands and Necks, and that they
no longer lie prostrate at the Feet of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent
Priest, or are obliged to hold his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
or Stirrup, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And tho since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
much of the extravagant Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of the Popish Clergy are abated; yet
it's observable, that in those Places where
Persecution is highest, the Magistrates are
most subject to the Power of the Priests.
And if the Magistrates themselves are thus
dealt with, what Usage must the People
have, who are indeed made most miserable
and wretched Slaves, as tho Nature had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
them to be (what the Clergy there
suppose they are) <hi>Asini ad portenda onera
Clericorum?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. It may be said, This will only happen
in Popish Countries. But if Persecution
was the Cause of these most pernicious Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
in the more early Times of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
when Men were supposed to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
What Reason is there to imagine, that
in these latter and worser Times, it will not
have as bad if not worse Effects? And if
the Protestant Clergy can perswade the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
to use Force to hinder People from
examining, or even knowing any Doctrine
but what they have a mind to impose on
them, a thing so contrary to the Light of
Nature, the Gospel, and their own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51550:80"/>
what is there that by their joint En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
they could not, or would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
when it served to promote their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest?
Nay, have not the Protestant Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
been every jot as much, if not more
zealous and industrious than the Popish,
to enslave the People, and promote Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Power, and have preached up abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Passive Obedience even as much as
Faith in Christ, as knowing that the only
way to secure Tyranny in the Church, was
first to get it established in the State; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Tyranny, by bringing the generality
to Poverty and Slavery, must depress their
Minds, and debase their Thoughts, and
make them ready blindly to submit to the
Determinations of the Clergy? And tho
some would be in better Circumstances, yet
what they enjoy would be so precarious,
that they could not be secure without they
comply with the Religion of the Prince;
who if he be a great Bigot, (as the Clergy
would do their utmost to make him so)
would be sure to use all the Violence Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Power could give him to force Men
to profess the Court Religion: Or if he
should turn to the other Extream, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of being Superstitious, should have
little or no regard for Religion; yet if he
should sometime or other be troubled in
Conscience, (as even the most vicious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51550:81"/>
are) the Clergy would be sure to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him, that the only way to expiate
his former Guilt, would be to promote the
true Religion, by depriving those that are
not of it of their Possessions, and investing
the Church (that is, themselves) with it.
And to speak the Truth, it's to such that
the Clergy have been most obliged, either
for destroying their Opposers, or else for
endowing them with vast Riches. In a
word; It's not meerly Speculative Matters,
or Forms, or Ceremonies, wherein the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
differ from the Protestants; but those
things (which I have now mentioned, and
wherein they agree) that make Popery and
Slavery inseparable: Nay in Church-Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
do not the Protestant Clergy (even those
that own the Magistrate, under Christ, to
be, no Causes or Persons excepted, <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Head or Governour of the Church</hi>)
claim, as well as the Papists, a Supream
Power, and assert themselves Independent
and Absolute Governours of the Church?
And consequently, since there cannot be
two Supreams in the same Matters, they
can extend that Power, as occasion serves,
even further than the Pope does, since they
and not their Subject the Magistrate, will
be Judg of the Extent of their own Power.
And have not the Priests of the different
Parties, as occasion served, enlarged their
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51550:81"/>
Pretences? witness the Kirk, which as it
had an Opportunity, exercised as great a
Power, and with as high a Hand as the Pope
himself. And had <hi>Laud</hi> and that Party
conquered, there's no doubt but the People
had been as much enslaved to them, as they
are in other Countries to the Pope. In short,
could any one Party have extirpated by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
the others, (it being the Division
amongst the Clergy, which of them should
lord it over God's Heritage, that has hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
each others Attempts) we had long
before now been under as great a Tyranny
as the Papists; especially had they those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues,
which in a manner enabled the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Priests to effect what they had a mind
to, and which our Clergy think so much
their due, that they look on it no less than
Sacrilege that they are hindred from enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them. But,</p>
               <p>7. This is not all the Mischief that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
forcing the People to a Uniformity in
all those Points the Priests get to be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
as necessary to Church-Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
because where People are wise, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and have any Value for Religion, they
will be sure to employ their Thoughts about
it; which if they do, it's morally impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that they should be of a Mind in all
those Points: Therefore such a Uniformity is
only practicable in a Nation overrun with
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51550:82"/>
sottish Ignorance and gross Stupidity. But
what can be more prejudicial to a Nation,
than want of Knowledg, which is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to preserve a State, and encrease its
Strength and Riches, by promoting all use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Arts and Trades, which we see by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
will not thrive but where there is
Liberty of Conscience?</p>
               <p>Besides, where Ignorance and Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the necessary Consequence of Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
prevails, it's almost unavoidable but
that Men, either of themselves will run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
or else by designing Persons be perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into several Opinions prejudicial to the
State, as amongst the Papists so many Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-days
are; or, which is much more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial,
such prodigious Numbers going
into Orders, (by which the Clergy are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to carry on the Common Interest, and
therefore will every where design it) which
oppresseth the Common-Wealth with so
many useless Persons, who no-wise contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to the Support or the Encrease of
the Riches of a Country; who also, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
how they must be maintained, will
be more burdensome than a standing Army
of double the Number. These, or other
as prejudicial Superstitions, are scarce pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to be avoided where Persecution
reigns.</p>

8. But I need mention no other Effects of
Persecution than the Disorders, Tumults,
Confusions, Wars, Desolations, which are
the immediate and necessary Consequences
of it, and which have always happened in
persecuting Countries; which to relate,
would be to write a History of those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and which alone is sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
any one how fatal it is to Human So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties.</p>
               <p>It was Persecution that so weakened and
ruined the Roman Empire, that it became
an easy Prey to the Barbarians: And it had
done the same to the Germans, had not the
Treaty of <hi>Munster</hi> put some stop to it;
since which time the Papists and Protestants
(taught by woful Experience) are content
to allow one another, in several places, not
only their distinct Congregations, but to
meet in the very same Churches; and
(which is more to be wondered at) the
Preferments of those Churches are enjoyed
by them alternately with the greatest Quiet
and Peace imaginable. But if we have a
mind to have a nearer prospect of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of Liberty of Conscience, we need
not look farther than the Province of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
which tho a very small Tract of
Land, labouring under a great many natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Disadvantages, and in which, before a
Toleration was indulged, were only a few
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51550:83"/>
small scattered Villages and Huts of Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
is now crowded with vast Numbers
of People, filled with immense Riches, and
adorned with many stately and magnificent
Cities; and all this in a manner owing to
its receiving those Saints and Confessors,
(for so I must call them, whatever their
Opinions are) who for their Love to God,
and Zeal for his Service, were forc'd to
leave their Country, and fled there for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.
And it's to this (the greatest and
noblest Charity) that <hi>Amsterdam</hi> (in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
manner the Care of Heaven) ows its
Greatness. Here especially 'tis that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
of <hi>Esay</hi> seems to be fulfilled, that the
<hi>Wolf shall lie down with the Lamb, and the
Leopard with the Kid,</hi> &amp;c. each Sect striv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to outvie one another in promoting the
Interest of the City, and in being charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to those that want it; no Differences of
Opinions causing the least distrubance to the
Publick, or hindering the Friendship of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Persons; tho it was otherwise, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in this City, but in all Places of the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Provinces,</hi> when they had the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
to be influenced by the Clergy, and
the weakness to call a Synod on pretence
of composing the <hi>Arminian</hi> or <hi>Quinquar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularian</hi>
Controversies: Which, as it usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
happens, only encreased them; and
which is worse, created not only Animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51550:83"/>
and Rancour in the Minds of Men,
but Discontents, Disorders, Tumults, to
almost the Ruin of the Common-Wealth;
whilst in <hi>England,</hi> the Government neither
condemning or censuring either Party, the
Contention had no mischievous Effect, but
of it self died away. Had the Nation
acted as wisely with respect to those foolish
Controversies about Ceremonies and other
Trifles, how much Blood and Treasure had
it saved, and how happy had it been, tho
now it has (grown wiser by Experience)
clearly perceived that nothing but Liberty
in those Points could quiet and compose the
Minds of the People, or preserve the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so much exhausted by Persecution.</p>
               <p>9. We need not look abroad for Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for a Toleration, since we never made
a step towards it, but what has been of happy
Consequence to the Nation; witness the
mighty Advantages we gained by the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
allowed the Walloons, and other
Dissenters from the Church established by
Law. What was it that made <hi>Norwich,</hi>
(which in the beginning of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s
Reign was so desolate, that it was
often debated in Council, whether it should
be demolished as being a Receptacle of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant
and idle Persons, and therefore dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to the Government) become so very
considerable for its Riches and Trade, but
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51550:84"/>
the granting Liberty to the Flemins (whom
<hi>D'Alva</hi>'s Cruelty had forced to fly their
Countrey) to settle there, and set up their
Manufacture of Stuffs, as they did at <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi>
their Bays, to the infinite Advantage
of the Nation? And there's no Reason why
we may not expect greater Advantages by
those Manufactures and Trades the French
Refugees (if well encouraged) may set up
with us. On the contrary, Persecution has
been as prejudicial to the Nation, by driving
not only the Traders and Trades themselves
beyond Seas, (as it has happened with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to those Woollen Manufactures
wrought in <hi>Sussex</hi> and <hi>Essex,</hi> which those
that by Persecution were forced to leave
their Countrey, have set up in <hi>Holland</hi> and
other Places, to the almost ruin of our Trade
of those Woollen Manufactures in the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
within the <hi>Sound</hi>) but by hindring great
Numbers (of which many Instances can be
given) who had they Liberty to exercise
their Religion, would have settled here to
as great Advantage to the Nation as any
it has permitted to inhabit here. But it
would be endless to mention the great
Mischiefs Persecution has caused, even in
the Memory of Man, by either driving
great Numbers of our most useful People
beyond Seas, or by starving them, or cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them to perish in noisom Jails, or by
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51550:84"/>
imprisoning or beggaring them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
depriving them of the Opportunity and
Means to carry on their Trades. To give
no other Instance but in <hi>Bristol,</hi> where, by
reason of the Persecution in <hi>Ch. 2d</hi>'s Time,
the Customs of that Place were diminished
by almost three parts in four; and it's no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
for Men will not then expose themselves
by Trading, but hide their Heads to avoid
Persecution. And 'tis owing to Toleration,
that our Trade is in so good Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as it is. But nothing was so fatal to
<hi>England</hi> as that unnatural War in King
<hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>1st</hi>'s Reign, chiefly caused by
Imposition and Persecution, fatal at last to
the Persecutors themselves. And the King
after he had seen the great Encourager and
Promoter of them brought to condign Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
was himself publickly executed
before that Palace from whence he issued out
his persecuting Orders; yet his Son <hi>Charles</hi>
the Second, to the unspeakable Prejudice of
the Nation, took the same Method of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting
his Protestant Subjects, even those
that were the chief Instruments of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration;
which however ungrateful as
well as unjust it was in him, yet in respect
of several of them, it was but a just Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who, when it was in their own
Power, were themselves Persecutors. And
it's more than probable, that that King
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51550:85"/>
(who had no other design in causing the
Protestants to persecute one another, but
that they might more easily become a Prey
to the Papists) was taken off by those very
People whose Interest by it he designed to
promote. And as to the late King (the chief
promoter of Persecution in his Brother's
Time) the Nation was very sensible, for all
his prevaricating, what a dreadful Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he intended them, and therefore it's not
strange they would not trust him.</p>
               <p>10. It's no wonder that God brings down
signal Judgments on the Heads of Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors,
since they, like the Giants of old,
make War against Heaven it self, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to deprive God of his peculiar
Empire over Conscience, which obligeth
him (if I may so say) to assert his Right
by making Examples of such bold and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
Men. And Examples of this Nature
are so frequent, that Men begin to wonder
at the long uninterrupted Prosperity of the
grand Persecutor, the French King. But
let it be considered, that Persecution is much
more odious in Protestants in general, as
being directly contrary to their Principles,
but with all the aggravating Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in these Nations, if upon their being
freed from the danger of Popery, they
should themselves practise the worst part
of it, in persecuting those they judg to be
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51550:85"/>
Hereticks, which is the very same thing
they so loudly exclaim against in the French
King. And let it be remembred, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Power is every where the same, and
that they have as much right in <hi>France</hi> to
judg who are Hereticks as any where else.
Therefore may it not be feared, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of the French King being made an
Example of God's Anger, he may be made
an Instrument to punish others?</p>
               <p>11. The great Advantage the Nation has
gained by the Liberty that has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
might, one would think, destroy all
the remains of a persecuting Spirit, since it
is that which has preserved Church and
State; else it had been impossible that the
Nation could have supported it self under
such Calamities as a War and a general Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution.
And it's the securing to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
their Religious as well as their Civil
Rights, that has made them with so much Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and Contentedness undergo all hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,
and in the midst of them be so very
zealous for the Government. And for my
part, I doubt not but it's owing to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that so signally declares it self for
Liberty of Conscience, that in the Course
of this War we have had so many signal
Mercies and miraculous Favours: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
we ought not to provoke God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of his Mercies, by persecuting any Sect
whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:51550:86"/>
12. By a partial Toleration we act incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with our selves, for either the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
ought to punish, or ought not to
punish those that err in Matters meerly
Religious. If the first, why are there so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Erroneous exempted even from
the least Punishment? If the last, why
are not all exempted? Where shall we
find a Rule to punish some and not others,
nay with the same Punishment, if the End
of it be, as it's pretended, to make Men im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
consider?</p>
               <p>I do not mention this so much upon the
account of a small Sect that's still liable to
the lash of the Law, but for the sake of all
Sects in general; because whilst that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of using Force upon the Account of
Matters meerly Religious, is not wholly
abhorred, no Sect can be safe. For,</p>
               <p>13. If any one Sect is to be punished up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Civil or Religious Account, it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
all: for as to the first, the Arguments
from Discord and Disturbances will equally
affect all that dissent in Matters simply
Religious. And as to the last, there's
no Reason to excuse Schisms, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Heresies; since, as it's owned by all,
a Schismatick cannot be a Member of the
Church of Christ, which is but one, and
consequently he is out of the ordinary
way of Salvation; and a Heretick, nay an
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:51550:86"/>
Infidel can be but so; and the Antient
Church, as Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> has sufficiently
proved, made no difference between a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick,
and a Schismatick that pretended to
justify his Schism upon Principles.</p>
               <p>14. Besides, the greater Moment any
Point is of, the greater Reason there is for
Liberty of Conscience, because Men ought
not by Punishment to be hindred from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
into it, which if they do sincerely,
and should be mistaken (as we are all falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
very fallible Men) that Mistake will
never be imputed to them. And if all that
are mistaken in these nice abstruse Points
of Belief should be punished, it would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
the greatest part of the now Orthodox
Clergy, who are so much divided amongst
themselves in these Points, that there's no
one Party equal to all the rest, and yet
there can be but one Party in the right.
And it ought to be observed, that the
Arguments any one Party of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
formerly urged for their own Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
tho otherwise unanswerable, were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
evaded by saying, they would equally
hold for allowing Liberty to Hereticks as
well as them; so that it's evident, except
Persecution is wholly abhorred, any little
Accident or Turn may hazard the Liberty
of any Sect whatever.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Some few Reasons for the Dissenters not
taking the Sacramental Test but in their
own Churches, and for a General Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalization.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. BEFORE I conclude, I must first beg
leave to add a word in behalf of
all the Dissenters in general, that hold no
Opinions destructive to the Government,
disown all Foreign Power, acknowledg the
King to be Rightful and Lawful, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
equally to the support of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
that they may be capable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
all Places of Trust and Profit: for how
is it consistent with that Justice and Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
the Government ought to have for
all its Subjects, to deprive any of them of
the Privileges of their Countrey to which
they are born, (and for the discharge of
which they have no ways incapacitated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
for no other Reason, but because their
Consciences will not permit them to receive
the Sacrament after the manner of the Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
Church, which is a Matter wholly
foreign to Civil Power, and a Dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a thing in it self indifferent? And since
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51550:87"/>
the Parliament has made them Legal
Churches in other respects, why should not
the receiving the Sacrament in their own
Meetings qualify them as well as at any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
The denying it them can only hinder
the truly Conscientious (of which there
never was a Nation that had more need)
from supplying Places of Trust. And as
this (with humble Submission) is a very great
Hardship on them, so it is as great a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to the Publick, not only as it tends to
discourage the Loyalty and Affection of
those that have such marks of Suspicion and
Disgrace fixed on them, but as it depriveth
the Government (which at this Time espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
has need of the Hearts and Hands of
all its Subjects) of the Service of no small
number of the most useful, who in spight
of all the Disadvantages they lie under, are
most hearty and zealous for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Had they sworn to bear true Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
to the King, and yet looked on him
as a Usurper, or (which is all one) a King
<hi>de facto,</hi> and had made use of such foolish
Equivocations, Distinctions, Reservations,
(as would even shame a Jesuit) to evade the
Force of their Oaths, and under-hand act
against the Government, there might be
some preten<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> to exclude them from these
Advantages; but otherwise there can be no
Reason for it, and those that will be disob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51550:88"/>
by the granting it, are as much so
already, as they well can be by the Liberty
that is given them.</p>
               <p>In short, no Government can be well
served that makes any thing a Condition
of obtaining an Advantage but what evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
contributes to its Establishment, or
any thing a means of Exclusion but what
tends to its Ruin: and as Capacity and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
should be the only just Titles to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
Men, so Incapacity and Infidelity to
debar or exclude them. But when the being
of this or that Sect is a step to Preferment,
they will be sure to prefer the Interest of
that Sect before the Publick; and Men will
be more considered for their Zeal to a Party,
than for their Ability to serve their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
And when they shall be commended
or condemned, favoured or opposed, not
according to their Merits, but as they are of
this or that Sect or Party, it must fill all
Places, even the chief Council of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with Confusion and Faction, and make
them influenced by indirect and sinister
Ends, instead of the Publick Good.</p>
               <p>But if all Sects were equally and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
dealt with, there would be no
other than a noble Emulation amongst them
who should do most good to the Publick,
and be most serviceable to their King and
Countrey, and with respect to one another,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51550:88"/>
a most laudable Contention to outvie each
other in all Acts of Charity and Kindness,
and all other good Offices, and a pious Strife
who should be most exemplary in their
Lives and Conversations, as the best way to
support themselves, and gain Credit and
Esteem to their Party; which must needs
bring an unexpressible Happiness to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and restore again the Golden Age, by
reviving amongst us the true Spirit of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.</p>
               <p>By what has been said, I think I may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
conclude, that a universal, impartial,
inviolable Liberty of Conscience, (except
where the Principles of any sort of Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
tend evidently to the Prejudice of the
Community, and the Ruin of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
is the true Interest and great Duty,
both of Governours and Governed. And,</p>
               <p>If to this Liberty a General Naturaliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was added, it could not fail of causing
an infinite deal of Good to the Nation, and
quickly repair the Loss we have sustained,
either by the War, or by Persecutions: For
the Excellency of our Constitution and
Laws (not to be equalled in any other
Country) and the Happiness of the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
abounding with so many natural Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
especially for Trading, will tempt,
not only great Numbers of useful Handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts-men,
but also of Merchants and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51550:89"/>
trading People to settle here, and bring
their Effects with them; by which Means
we should have no reason to doubt of our
being Masters of those Trades we want,
and improving those we have already, by
making the Manufactures either cheaper or
better. And then, and not till then, we
shall have a sufficient number of Hands
to carry on the Fishing Trade, and not
want them any where else; by all which
means we should so encrease our Seamen
and Shipping, that we could not fail of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Masters at Sea, tho all <hi>Europe</hi> should
combine against us. And since the Success
of a War does now in a manner wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the Riches of a Nation; and they
that have most Money, are almost certain
to have the better of it; the Riches that
must flow into the Nation by this Means,
would enable them (tho they stood alone)
to be a Match for their most potent Enemy,
when perhaps otherwise we may sometime
or other be in danger of being oppressed by
him. And when a troublesome Neighbour
encreases in Riches and Strength, we are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much wanting to our selves, if we do not
to our utmost endeavour to do the same. All
that the Government would suffer by a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalization,
would be to have not only the
Number of its Subjects (in which consists
the Riches and Strength of a Nation) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51550:89"/>
and them also under as strict an
Obligation of Loyalty and Duty as any
of the Native Subjects, but its Revenues
also augmented, by not only more of the
Exciseable Commodities being consumed,
but by the vast Encrease of Trade, which
must proportionably increase the Customs.
All the Disadvantage the Natives would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
by such an Act, would be, that by a
quick Vent and Consumption of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
of the Country, the Value of all
home Commodities would be raised, Land
and Houses yield greater Rents, and Money
by its Encrease and quick Circulation be
plenty; and those that have a mind to dispose
of their Estates, would (the Number of the
Chapmen being so much encreased) sell to
a much greater Advantage; and all the
Purchase-Money the Foreigners give, would
be an additional Treasure to the Nation.</p>
               <p>But it requires a just Treatise to show,
(what I have not as much as time to hint at
here) all the Advantages we should receive
by a Naturalization Act: Therefore I shall
only answer an Objection of some, who tho
they cannot but own that it would be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to the Nation, yet are against
it, upon an Apprehension it may be prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to Religion. But I think I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
proved, that no Part of Religion can be
opposite to, or inconsistent with the Good
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51550:90"/>
of Societies; but on the contary, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
the Publick Good is the chiefest
Part of it. And if to supply the Wants of
the Poor and Needy be the greatest Duty,
<hi>viz.</hi> of Charity, and to visit the Fatherless
and Widows, in order to relieve their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,
be <hi>pure and undefiled Religion,</hi> it
must be so in the highest manner, to prevent
Peoples falling into Want and Poverty:
And whatever contributes to this, (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when it tends to the Support, not only
of a few, but of a whole Nation) must be
the Duty of every one to promote that is a
lover of his God, his King, and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
And whatsoever is inconsistent with
doing this, is so far from being a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Religion, that it must be either sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in it self, or by the Circumstances that
attend it become so, and therefore by no
means is to be opposed to the Good of a
Nation. And indeed nothing can be more
strange, than to suppose God has command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any thing inconsistent with the Publick
Good: Yet without this Supposition, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Persecution, Humane Sacrifices, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Passive Obedience, (the most perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Doctrines that can be) but no other
destructive Ones could have prevailed. And
it's this monstrous Absurdity that <hi>Jacobites</hi>
are guilty of, in thinking they are obliged
to sacrifice the Peace and Happiness of a
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51550:90"/>
Nation to the Interest of a particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>But I shall conclude, only adding, That
I hope what I have said will not displease
the Magistrate, since I have no other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
than to hinder him from committing
one of the greatest Sins Humane Nature is
capable of, and which cannot but turn to
his Prejudice here, as well as hereafter.</p>
               <p>And as to the Clergy, This cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
those that have what the Bishop of
<hi>Sarum</hi> (in his Preface to <hi>Lactantius</hi>) calls
<hi>Lay Pity,</hi> since I have endeavoured to show
how much they are in the right in abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Persecution, and how causlesly they
are for that Reason hated (as generally
they are) by their Brethren: And for those
that are for Persecution, the greatest Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
I could do them, was to represent, as
fully as I could, in so short a Discourse, the
fatal Tendency and Consequence of that
Doctrine, that they may repent of it;
which if I any ways contribute to, I think
my Pains happily bestowed; if not, I yet
hope a Reward from him who accepts the
hearty sincere endeavour of those that do
their best to promote Peace and Charity:
which if any hinder or obstruct, it's the
Duty of all good Christians to pray that
God would abate their Pride, asswage their
Malice, and confound their Devices; that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51550:91"/>
there may be <hi>Glory to God on High, Peace on
Earth, and good Will towards Men.</hi>

Judging for themselves about Religious Doctrines
and Opinions.</p>
            <p>1. The Author of this Letter (<hi>P.</hi> 3.) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
<hi>That the Indifference of all Religion is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to be established by the Pleas for the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Necessity of a Vniversal unlimited Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
Which Assertion, were it true, would
make the King and Parliament indifferent whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were Quakers, since they have given
them a Toleration: But it's so far from being
true, that there cannot well be a greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of Mens not thinking all Religions
indifferent, than a desire to be tolerated in the
Profession of that they judg the best. Did they
suppose all Religions equal, it would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
to them whether there was a Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
since they would be sure to avoid all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51550:91"/>
by being of the Magistrate's Religion.</p>
            <p>2. The Author (<hi>P.</hi> 19.) saith, <hi>Tho the Clergy
have no Power of changing, adding, or diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Law of God, yet the applying this Law to
particular Cases, explaining the Doubts that may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
concerning it, deducing Consequences from it in
things not explicitly determined already by that Law,
and the enforcing Submission and Obedience to their
Determinations, are the proper Objects of their
Power and Jurisdiction, who are to act by ordinary
and natural Means, such as Assembling, Deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and by majority of Voices Deciding.</hi> But
here I must demand, Who shall judg whether
what the Clergy thus determine, be either ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
changing, or diminishing the Law of God?
If the Priests, to be sure they will not say their
Determinations are so: But if I must judg, then
I ought to reject their Determinations, if I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them not consonant to Scripture; but if I
think them agreeable to it, then I must believe
them (not for the sake of their Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but) because I judg them to be so; and
consequently I must be guided by my own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in all things of Religion.</p>
            <p>If by <hi>the Doubts that may arise,</hi> be meant
any thing that admits of dispute, there is scarce
any thing so clear but what may, or does; and
if in all such Cases I am obliged to submit to the
Determinations of the Clergy, I may be forc'd
to believe what I judg is either adding, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or diminishing the Law of God, as it's
manifest all Sects, by believing it to be of their
own Side, do judg their Adversaries do add, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But if it be meant, that the Clergy have a
Right to make me believe a thing whilst I
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51550:92"/>
doubt of the Truth of it, that is impossible;
and so it is to change my Mind, before I see
Reason for it. It may be said, tho it's not in
my Power to believe as they will have me, yet
I may do as they command, even whilst I doubt
of the Lawfulness of the Action: But then to
obey them, would be the ready way to damn
my self; for <hi>he that acts when he doubts, is damn'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No Law, whether of God or Man, can scarce
be of any use, without applying it to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Cases, and deducing Consequences from it,
and explaining Doubts that arise: But if the
Laity must be determined by the Priests in all
such Cases, they must become Brutes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
their Reason, where they ought to make
the most use of it.</p>
            <p>Our Author, I confess, says not that a Man
should rest in the Determinations of the Clergy
in deducing Consequences in things explicitly
determined by the Law of God: But what is
meant by things explicitly determined, I do
not well understand; for tho Words are expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit,
yet the Things implied in those Words, are
certainly implicit: And if the Clergy can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
Men to follow (right or wrong) their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
in deducing Consequences in things
implicitly determined by Scripture, they may
oblige Men to add, change or diminish the Law
of God in most Points.</p>
            <p>3. The Popish Priests never carried their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
higher than this Author does; they have
not the Impudence to assert, they can oblige
People to believe contrary to the Law of God;
but that for the sake of the Church's Peace,
they have a Right to determine those Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51550:92"/>
that may arise among the Faithful; and
when they have done so, none ought to begin
to examine those Points again. In a word,
there is no Medium between the Protestant
Doctrine of every one having a Right to judg
for himself, and the Popish one of being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to believe as the Church does. But this
Author is much more absurd than the Papists,
in making Truth and Falshood to be decided,
not by an Infallible Pope or Council, whose De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
are to bind the Catholick Church, but by
the casting Voices of a Fallible Convocation in
every Nation; which may in <hi>Spain</hi> oblige the
People to believe Transubstantiation, in <hi>Sweden</hi>
Consubstantiation, in <hi>England</hi> the Real Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
Presence; so that a Man may be bound to
change his Sentiments with his Habitation, and
the Difference of a Degree or two may oblige
him to opposite Opinions. And yet, as absurd
as this is, since the Clergy are so infinitely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
amongst themselves, the Laity must either
do so, or else judg for themselves, if it were
but to know which of the Clergy were in the
Right. But,</p>
            <p>4. <hi>The Pamphleteer supposes this impossible,
and</hi> (pag. 18. <hi>where he speaks out) he round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tells the Commons of</hi> England, <hi>That</hi> it's a
little too much to suppose Countrey Gentlemen, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
or Lawyers, to be nicely skill'd in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
of the Bible, Masters of all the Learning of
the Fathers, or of the History of the Primitive
Church, which they must in some measure be, who
sit Judges of Religious Doctrines and Opinions,
which ought to be left to their proper Tribunal, a
Convocation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:51550:93"/>
Had People at the Reformation been of this
Mind, we might still have groaned under the
Popish Yoke; for the Majority of the Clergy,
not only in <hi>England,</hi> but every where else,
were as averse to this Reformation (which may
justly be called a Lay one) as the Jewish Priests
were to that of Christ and his Apostles.</p>
            <p>If to be Masters of all the Learning of the
Fathers, be necessary to the judging of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Doctrines, it's as necessary the Laity should
understand them, because the Clergy are strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
divided amongst themselves about them, each
Sect pretending they are on their Side; which
shows that either the Clergy are not to be
trusted with giving us the Sense of those Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
because they make them say any thing
according as it serves their present Interest;
or that the Fathers talk forward and backward,
contradict themselves as well as one another;
which if so, shows great disingenuity in the
Clergy not to own it: and if we may trust
Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> (a Man unsuspected of the least
Priestcraft) he tells us, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <q>That he sees
plainly, and that with his own Eyes, that
there are Councils against Councils, some
Fathers against others, the same Fathers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
themselves, a Consent of Fathers of
one Age against a Consent of Fathers of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Age, the Church of one Age against
the Church of another Age.</q>
            </p>
            <p>5. The Apostles were so far from requiring
the Christians to give up their Judgments to any
Number of fallible Men, that they command
them all to make use of their Reason in judging
of Religion, commend those (as the Bereans)
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:51550:93"/>
that did so, and blame those that did not; <hi>Why
have you not judged these things of your selves?</hi>
And if Men were then obliged to try the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
because there were many false Prophets
gone out into the World, there is certainly
much more reason to do so now. But having
spoken fully to this Point in <hi>Ch. 2. Par.</hi> 1. I shall
only add, that it's a Rule authorised by common
Sense, not to consent to any thing till we are
capable of judging of its Truth; nor can we,
without renouncing our Reason, suppose God
will have us believe any thing without seeing
good Reason for it: And nothing can reflect
more on the Wisdom and Goodness of God,
than to suppose that he, who would have all
Men come to the Knowledg of his Will, should
yet make it so obscure, that not one in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
is capable of knowing it, because it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon Skill in Fathers, Criticks, Church-History,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> A Man may therefore justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
if there be any such Doctrines pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
(as there are in most Systems) the impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of the Peoples judging of them, alone
demonstrates they come not from God; who
as he was able, so his Goodness made him wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to express Truth so clearly, that all who
are not wilfully blind may understand it in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to practice; and it would seem strange
that God should chuse Fishermen, and such sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Persons, to preach a Religion intelligible on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Learned and Philosophers. There's no
need of running to Fathers, Criticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For <hi>he
that will do the Will of God, shall know</hi> (as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<hi>John</hi> 7. saith) <hi>of the Doctrine whether it be
of God;</hi> that is, if it be such as tends to make
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:51550:94"/>
me love, reverence and honour God, or is bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
to Man; and a Doctrine cannot shew it self
to be of God any otherwise than as it has
this Mark and Character stampt upon it. Hence
it is that God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. speaking of the Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
and Covenant, saith, <hi>I will put my Laws
into their Minds, and write them in their Hearts:
And they shall not teach every Man his Neighbour,
and every Man his Brother, saying, Know the Lord;
for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.</hi>
And to interpret this Law (which is written in
our Hearts, and which we cannot from the
greatest to the least fail to discover, if we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to our own Minds) by Fathers, Councils,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> is to interpret a Rule that's clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in it self, by what is most obscure and
mysterious. If the Gospel be hid from any,
it's not the Poor, the Babes, the Simple, but
the Pretenders to vain <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
falsly so called,</hi> the Wranglers and
<hi>Disputers of this World,</hi> who would fain be
thought to be the <hi>Wise and Prudent;</hi> and
as it was their Prejudices and Prepossessions
made them esteem the Gospel the <hi>foolishness of
Preaching,</hi> so it afterward made some of them
corrupt the foolishness of Preaching with their
wise unintelligible Philosophy; and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
by <hi>following the Tradition of Men, made
void the Commandments of God.</hi> The first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
despised any Authority but that of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Scripture; and had those that succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them followed their Example, they had no
doubt destroyed Popery, whose chief Support
consists in Human Traditions, as Fathers, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:51550:94"/>
6. The Subject of this Book shows how little is
to be relied on the Authority of those Men, on
which they will have every thing to rely: for
tho the Light of Nature, by placing Man in
such a helpless Condition, that he cannot subsist
without the Assistance of others, does oblige all
Men (except he that is Orthodox to himself is
Al sufficient for himself) to be most kind, loving
and friendly one to another; and agreeable to
this, the Scripture most passionately recommends
the Love of our Neighbour, but most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
and zealously when we differ from him;
and tho the observance of this Command has at
all times been absolutely necessary, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
from the beginning being divided in their
Sentiments; yet for all this, there never was a
Convocation of Priests, but what notoriously
broke this Rule, by not only most uncharitably
anathematizing and damning those that could
not comply with their Sentiments, but by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
Men to abstain from all Commerce and
Converse with them, and (as soon as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
had the Power of the Sword) to treat
them most inhumanely and barbarously: And
by degrees the Clergy so intoxicated the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that they were perswaded that this Branch
of the Fundamental Law of Nature and the
Gospel, (so absolutely necessary in this State of
Ignorance and Darkness) was one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Crimes imaginable. The Author of the
<hi>Letters concerning Toleration,</hi> is (if not absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the first) the first that amongst us has ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
to assert the Justice and Necessity of a
Toleration in its due and full Extent. An
Author that on more Accounts than one, is
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:51550:95"/>
to be esteemed a Patron of the Liberties of
Humane Nature, and a Guardian of the
Happiness and Safety of Civil Societies, and
who has by his Writings been most ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to Mankind, in enlightning their
Minds, and in improving their Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
for which he must never expect for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
by Men of the Pamphleteer's Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>But to return: Tho our Author supposes it
no small Crime</hi> (P. 15.) <hi>for the Parliament to
judg of Matters of Religion; yet he grievously
complains, that</hi> notwithstanding the urgency of
the Occasion, no Relief has been effected that way;
and tho the Commons have a standing Committee
for Religion, nothing (as I remember) has since the
Revolution been done by them in behalf of it.</p>
            <p>But what can Men in a Legislative Capacity
do more for Religion, than (besides punishing
Vice and Immorality) to protect every one
in worshipping God as they judg most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to his Will, and give them the best Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of informing themselves of his
Mind? And have they not done this, by grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Toleration, and by refusing a Bill for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining
the Liberty of the Press?</p>
            <p>8. In short; when the Clergy had corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Christian, as much as the Heathen Priests
had Natural Religion, it pleased God, out of
his great Goodness, that the <hi>Noble Art of Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
should be discovered, whereby Men could
with ease communicate their Thoughts to the
World; and some free-spirited Men (who durst
judg with their own Understandings) do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, and Copies of their Works being
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:51550:95"/>
dispersed, it caused many to perceive how
miserably they had been imposed on by
their Spiritual Guides, which (as it may well
be imagined) strangely alarm'd the Kingdom
of Darkness, of which I shall give but one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Woolsey</hi> (Lord <hi>Herb.</hi> Hist. of <hi>H.</hi> 8.)
in a Letter to the Pope, tells him, <q>That his
Holiness could not be ignorant what divers
Effects the new Invention of Printing had
produced; that it had brought in and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
Books and Learning, and had been the
occasion of those Sects and Schisms that daily
appear in the World, and chiefly in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
where Men begin to question the Faith
and Tenets of the Church; that if this were
suffered, the common People, besides other
Dangers, might come to believe there was
not so much need of the Clergy.</q> The Priests,
to secure themselves from any harm from this
new Invention, did their utmost to hinder any
thing from being printed but what was on their
own side, and by that means to turn this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Engine on their Enemies, which as far as it
was quickly and steddily put in Execution, had
its desired Effect in preserving of Popery; but
in those Places where (by the Connivance of
the Government, or otherwise) this Method was
not strictly observed, the People threw off the
Popish Yoke, and the generality of the Clergy
were forced to comply; yet loth to forgo their
beloved Empire over the Consciences of Men,
they quickly endeavoured to make the People
pay the same Obedience to their Determinations
as they formerly did to the Romish Clergy;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:51550:96"/>
and as they made use of the same Arguments
and the very same Method to enslave them, so
they were no less zealous to hinder the Liberty
of the Press (which puts me in mind of what
<hi>Le Clere</hi> observes at the latter end of the Life
of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> that tho Theology is subject to
Revolutions, as well as Empire, and has under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
considerable Changes, yet that the Humour
of the Divines is not much altered;) but the
Powers the Clergy claimed to themselves being
inconsistent with the Principles of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and in <hi>England</hi> with the Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
and that Power the Laws have inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
the King with, there is nothing so contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
as their pretended Power, and that which
they are forced to own does belong to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate:
So that our high Church-men are not
consistent with themselves, no not in one Point,
but (what is worse) assert such Principles as
make the Reformation it self criminal; and
which must unavoidably oblige a Man that acts
agreeable to those Principles, to return to the
Popish Yoke, as shall be demonstrated in my
next Discourse. It was these Principles that
made the most judicious Person the Church
could ever brag of, the famous <hi>Chillingworth,</hi>
return to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and continue
there a long time: But what his Principles were
upon leaving it, and how inconsistent with that
of High Church, may be learn'd by what I
have quoted of him. And I could give an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of one who in the late Reign going into
the World from the University, (where he had
a long time imbibed these Notions of the Power
of the Clergy) and meeting with the Romish
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:51550:96"/>
Priests, who then were very busy, they quickly
show'd him the Inconsistency of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and the Protestant Religion with these
Powers; which had that Influence over him, as
to cause him (who did not then suspect the false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of those Notions owned by both Churches)
to join with them, who are consistent with
themselves in the Powers they claim, until so
many particular Absurdities in their Practice
made him happily examine these Notions;
which had like to have cost him dear, for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to join with them after <hi>Candlemass</hi> 87, and
receiving the Sacrament the next Opportunity,
the <hi>Easter</hi> after, in his College Chappel, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
him to the Malice and Revenge of the
Popish Priests, (then in the height of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity)
who of all Men will the least spare a
relapsed Heretick. But why do I instance in
Particulars, since it's these extravagant Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Clergy's Power the support the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
Cause, and make thousands embrace that
Religion; for Men with scorn and contempt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
contradictory and inconsistent Opinions.
But of these things more fully in my next Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
where I doubt not to demonstrate, as
far as a thing of such a Nature is capable, that
the Clergy are so far from having these Powers
by the Law of God, that there is no Power or
Jurisdiction whatever belongs to them by that
Law. But to return;</p>
            <p>9. I'll demand of this Author, Should a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
determine contrary to his Judgment,
(which may easily enough be supposed, since he
saith, <hi>P.</hi> 7. That <hi>there is no Order, Degree, or
Place amongst us, wholly free from the Infection of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:51550:97"/>
undermining or overthrowing the Catholick Faith</hi>)
whether he could, or (were it in his Power)
would renounce his Faith for the sake of the
casting Voice or Voices in a Convocation? If he
dares not say he will prostitute his Belief at so
vile a Rate, Why should he suppose others
either should or would do so? Tho I believe he
may assure himself that there's none amongst
those he calls <hi>infected,</hi> so little Christians and
Protestants, but what think they ought to be
able to give a better Account and Reason of
their Faith than the Determination of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
now-a-day, especially when they know
that not only Particular but General Councils,
have constantly made their Market of their
Faith, and always sold it to the fairest Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and that it was a meer Accident that
established the present Orthodoxy; <hi>Theodosius</hi>
being bred that Way, and so resolved to force
his Subjects to be of the same Sentiments, and
his living a long time so as to survive most of
the Hereticks, was the Cause that there were
no more Emperors to make the Christian
World become again Arian: And the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
used to establish Orthodoxy, would at
the same Rate have established Mahometism:
So that the mere Authority of a Convocation
can no ways influence Hereticks, who by being
out of the Church, show how little they value
the Authority of Church-men. And for any
Power, by which they might be forced, he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
honestly owns the Church has none over
them: For (<hi>P.</hi> 27.) you <hi>pretend not to meddle
with those without, nor to exercise any Act of Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
over them, but only to frame Rules and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:51550:97"/>
that shall hold within your selves, and to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
and judg your own Members.</hi> And the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of a Convocation is, it seems, to censure
some of the Church, and make them retract
their Opinions: For, (<hi>P. 13.) as long as these
Books pass uncensured and unretracted, under the
Stile and Name of Men of great Place and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
in the Church, the Mischief which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
they have yet left with some Men may be
able to do, is not sufficiently prevented, nor the
Scandal wiped off from our Church and Nation.</hi>
But what can be more scandalous to the Church
and Nation, than to force People to lie both to
God and Man, by making them retract those
Opinions they believe to be true? And nothing
can be more abominable than this constant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Clergy, in making Men solemnly
and publickly disown what in their Hearts they
still believe: and this is generally done without
the least colour of convincing them, nay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
giving them any new Arguments, or any
further Time to consider; and lest they should
<hi>relapse,</hi> as they call it, that is, dare to be no
longer Hypocrites, they threaten them with
greater Punishments, and even Death it self.
So that if this be the Business of a Convocation,
I know not a more compendious way of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men Villains.</p>
            <p>I have been the longer insisting on this Point,
to show that the very End and Reason that the
Author pretends for the Sitting of a Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the Powers, he saith, belong to them
of judging of Religious Doctrines for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and enforcing Submission and Obedience
to their Determinations concerning them, are
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:51550:98"/>
Antiprotestant and Antichristian, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
not to be permitted in any Protestant
Country.</p>
            <p>10. It's one of the most important Duties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
on the Clergy (as I have shown, <hi>Par.
2. Chap.</hi> 6.) to take care that Differences of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
(which in this State of Darkness and
Ignorance are unavoidable) should not destroy
Love and Charity, nor disturb the Peace of the
Church, by erecting Schisms and Divisions:
But the Pious Clergy, so far from doing this,
have made the direct contrary their almost sole
Business, by imposing their own Conceptions
(instead of the Word of God) on the People, and
by industriously contriving such Expressions as
are the likeliest to create Divisions, and then
cursing, damning, persecuting, and ruining
them for those Divisions themselves were the
sole Cause of; and this has been their constant
Practice in their Synods and Councils. And
therefore it's not at all strange that that Great
and Good Man, the late ABp should say (what, <hi>P.
8.</hi> of the <hi>Letter,</hi> is objected to him) <hi>That he never
knew any Good come from those sort of Meetings:</hi>
But he is not the only Person has said it; for
<hi>Gregory Nazianzen (Epist.</hi> 55.) has long ago
said, (when Heresy was more universal than
now it is) <hi>That he was resolved to avoid all Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
of Bishops, because he never saw a Synod that
had any Success, but what did rather encrease than
lessen the Evil; without any Exaggeration the Spirit
of Dispute and Ambition is so very great in them,
that it cannot be expressed.</hi> And this was not
spoke in a Heat, or dropt carelesly from him,
for he repeats it, not only in his <hi>65th, 71st,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:51550:98"/>
72d</hi> and <hi>74th</hi> Letters, but in his Poetical Pieces,
<hi>P.</hi> 80. where he saith, <hi>He will never go to any
Synod, because there's nothing to be heard there but
Geese and Cranes, who fight without understanding
one another: There one may see Divisions, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
and shameful Things which were hid before,
and are collected into one place with cruel Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Basilius</hi> (in his 102 <hi>Epist.</hi>) is of the same
Mind, in resolving carefully to avoid all Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
of Bishops, of whom he saith most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
things, even worse than <hi>Nazianzen.</hi> It
cannot be supposed that these Good Men (and
I might add, all that had any Ingenuity amongst
them) would say so very shameful things of
their Brethren, were there not very great Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
amongst them: But I need not mention
the Opinions of particular Persons, when the
Church-History sufficiently shews there can
scarce be more Scolding, Wrangling, Disorder
and Confusions in a Bear-Garden, than there
has constantly been in those sort of Meetings:
So that one would be apt to think there was
some Ground for what the Great <hi>Episcopius</hi> saith
in his <hi>Institutes,</hi> That <hi>the Bishops led on by Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Faction and Madness, did not so much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
as huddle up Creeds for the Christian World.</hi>
And considering the Heats and Animosities,
as well as differences of Opinions amongst the
Clergy, no better Effect at present can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from a Convocation, which instead of
destroying, will in all likelihood encrease Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
widen our Breaches, heighten our Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities,
and rend and tear the Church, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
all those (who are no contemptible
Number) that could not agree with the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:51550:99"/>
of the prevailing Party, and treating
them (according to usual Custom) as Hereticks.
And what Thoughts (prejudicial to the State
as well as the Church) this Disgrace, and the
loss of their Preferments, may inspire them
with; or what a Ferment by their instigation
it may cause in Peoples Minds, cannot well be
imagined. The Confusion was so great after
the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> that the good Emperor
begs of his Bishops to vouchsafe him peaceable
Days and quiet Nights, that he might continue
his Expedition against the Infidels, and not be
obliged to return to keep them in order. And
in all probability, the Consequence of a Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
would be a great interruption to the
King's prosecuting the War against the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of our Religion and Liberties, tho I hope
our Author has no such Design in seeming
so very zealous for a Convocation; yet who
can think him in earnest when he supposeth
(<hi>pag.</hi> 7.) The next Age will not believe a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
revealed by Heaven, except the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
make such a Declaration? Which
is so far from being true, that nothing would
more expose revealed Religion than the Heats
and Quarrels, and other Irregularities that
would happen in a Convocation. If Synods are
so necessary to preserve the Christian Religion,
how comes it that Mahometism (propagated at
first but by a private Man) should in spight of
frequent Councils get in most Places so much
the better; and that in others nothing but the
Name of the Christian Religion should be left,
the Councils having destroyed the Essence of it,
by introducing Ignorance, Superstition, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableness,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:51550:99"/>
Persecution, Popery, and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.
And no considering Man can doubt,
that had Convocations ever since the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
not only met, but debated of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Matters as they thought fit, as frequently
as our Author pretends it's their Right, the
Clergy long before now had assumed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
a Papal Power; or if since the Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
only, a Toleration as well as all other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Matters had been left to a Convocation,
which was to sit as frequently, and to debate
Matters as freely as the Parliament does, but
it would have caused such a Ferment both in
Church and State as would have destroyed both:
so that nothing has shown the Prudence and
Wisdom of our Protestant Ancestors more
than not allowing them those Powers our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
so zealously pleads for.</p>
            <p>11. Nothing more preserved the Church in the
late King's Reign, than the Dissenting Gentry
and Nobility unanimously refusing to join with
him in taking off the Test and Penal Laws, for
which the Church-men were not wanting in
words to express their grateful Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to promise them upon the first Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
all the Kindness imaginable; which
when it was in their Power, and the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was desired to come to some Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the Dissenters, they thought (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their former Obligations) that
Faith was as little to be kept with Schismaticks,
as the Council of <hi>Constance</hi> did with Hereticks:
But this is not the worst.</p>
            <p>A great many, it's to be feared, of our high
Church-men were so dissatisfied with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment's
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:51550:100"/>
depriving them of the Power of
persecuting their Brethren, (which is almost as
great a Grievance as to be persecuted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
that they have ever since hated the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and have endeavoured, as far as they
durst, to subvert it; tho they cannot but be
sensible that at the same time they attempt the
Ruin both of Church and State, and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into the bargain. But where will not
some Mens Spleen and Revenge carry them?
And it's plain, 'tis for want of their beloved
Persecution they are thus prejudiced, for none
were more zealous (notwithstanding the <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
Decree) than these Church-men to Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate
in defence of their Legal Rights, and for
the Security of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Person,
and did several other things more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with their former Notions, than any
they now pretend to scruple; but none seems
more inveterate than this Author, who (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing endears the King to the People
more than his Zeal for the Protestant Religion,
and securing to them the quiet Enjoyment of it
with the daily hazard of his Life) has endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to take off their Affections, by mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
insinuating as if his Majesty were a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of no Religion: For not to mention his
Hints and sly Insinuations, as <hi>P.</hi> 27. That <hi>those
that were against the Sitting of a Convocation, were
Enemies to all Religion, and the Professors of it;</hi>
and, <hi>P.</hi> 23. to this effect, as if <hi>Men whispered
that it was not the King's Judgment and Piety that
inclined him to be present at the Service of the
Church,</hi> and a great deal more to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
he speaks out more plainly, <hi>P.</hi> 22. where
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51550:100"/>
he takes occasion, (nothing to the purpose) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he has said, <hi>As for his Majesty's good Will,
we do not, I say we will not in the least doubt it,</hi> to
add, <hi>Tho some, who would be thought to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
his Mind best, and to be most in his Interests,
are pleased in all Companies to admire and celebrate
a Prince of no Religion as the best of Governours:</hi>
Which is more malicious, than if he had said it
himself in direct Terms, since it's the likeliest
way, not only to make it the more creditable
by laying it at their Door who pretend to know
the King best, and to be most in his Interest,
and to make them as well as his Majesty, be
thought Men of no Religion, for not only once
or twice, but in all Companies admiring and
celebrating a Prince of no Religion as the best
of Governours, but to make the King discharge
his Friends from any Trust about him when he
hears they suppose such dishonourable Things
of him, and to imploy his Enemies, Men of our
Author's Principles: So that <hi>Fenwick,</hi> it seems,
is not the only Person the Party has put on this
hellish Contrivance of aspersing those that are
most in the King's Interest, knowing they have
no way of doing their Business like creating in
his Majesty a Jealousy of his true Friends. And
our <hi>Author,</hi> that he might not be thought to speak
without Book, endeavours to make the King
guilty, not only of a Breach of his Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but of his Coronation-Oath, in not causing
the Convocation to sit and act as frequently as
he has done the Parliament. It's true, after
this he saith, with his usual way of Hypocrisy,
<hi>P. 63. We are sure his sacred Majesty did never
oppose their Sitting and Acting.</hi> But how could
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:51550:101"/>
he oppose it otherwise than by not calling them
to sit and act, which our Author says by his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation-Oath
he is bound to do? Which brings
me to his Law-part, in which (as I shall shew
in a few words) he is as much mistaken as in his
Divinity.</p>
            <p>12. He asserts, First, That the Convocation
is the highest Court of Judicature, having Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in Crimes Ecclesiastical.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That a Convocation is not only to
meet as often as the Parliament, but has the same
Right to debate as freely of Ecclesiastical Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as the Parliament has about Temporals.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That a Convocation is as necessary
and essential to the Church and Constitution, and
does bind all People in Ecclesiasticals, as a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
does in Civils.</p>
            <p>As to the first: If a Convocation be a Court
of Judicature, they must have Cognizance of
Original Causes, or of Appeals. If they had
to do with any Causes in the first Instance, they
would have a greater Power than either House
of Parliament claims; and our Author dares
not assert that a Convocation has greater Power
belonging to it than a Parliament. Besides, by
23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. none is to be cited out of his own Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
except in some few Cases, whereof Heresy is
one, for which the Arch-Bishop of the Province,
and he only, can summon a Man out of his own
Diocess; by whom (24 <hi>H.</hi> 8.) Causes were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to be determined, except Causes touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King, his Heirs and Successors, for
which there was an Appeal to the Prelats, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots,
and Priors of the Upper House, (and
this excepted Case confirms the Law in the non-excepted:)
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:51550:101"/>
And by a Statute made the next
Year, (<hi>C. 19.) All manner of Appeals, of what
Nature, Condition or Quality soever they be of,
or what Cause or Matter soever they shall concern,
shall be made according to</hi> 21 H. 8. <hi>with this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Proviso, That there lieth an Appeal from the
Arch-Bishop's Courts to the King in</hi> Chancery,
<hi>from whence no further Appeal is to be had or made.</hi>
Which cuts off all Pretences from the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of having any Jurisdiction now, whatever
they had in the Popish Times.</p>
            <p>13. As to the second; Whether a Convocati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on
is to be summoned as often as a Parliament;
tho he has offered nothing that looks like a Proof
of it, yet that I shall not dispute with him at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
but I shall whether they have a Right
to confer about making any Canons without a
special Licence from the King: Which tho he
asserts, he cannot bring one Lawyer of his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
they being all against him, as is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Practice of the Clergy, as zealous as they
are to maintain their Privileges, who never
since 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. attempted the making any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
without the King's Licence first obtained
under the Broad-Seal of <hi>England;</hi> which our
Author supposes to be but a meer Compliment,
and a bare Mark of Respect: And he affirms,
<hi>To say otherwise, is to wound the Liberties of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
through those of a Convocation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But is there no difference between the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
desiring, by the Mouth of their Speaker,
Liberty of Speech (that is, that the King would
not be displeased with their Freedom in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of those things they have a Right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate)
and a solemn Licence under the Broad-Seal
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:51550:102"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> to enable the Convocation to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
about such or such particular Points? It's
ridiculous to suppose the Broad-Seal is used
with so much Formality for the sake of mere
Compliments, to convey nothing but a Right the
Convocation had without it: The Broad-Seal is
so necessary to enable the Clergy to make Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
that all that is done without it is null and
void; and so would it be in respect of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
themselves, if they were to have such a
Licence to debate of any particular Point, in
order to make it a Law. As for Instance, by
an Act made 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. call'd <hi>Poining</hi>'s <hi>Act,</hi> it's
provided, <hi>That all such Bills as shall be offered
to the Parliament in</hi> Ireland, <hi>shall be first tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
hither under the Great Seal of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
and having received Approbation, shall be
put under the Broad-Seal bere, and so offered to
that Parliament: And if a Parliament be held con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to this Form, it shall be deemed null and void.</hi>
And in <hi>Scotland</hi> the Parliament, until this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution,
could debate of nothing but what the
Lords of the Articles had first agreed should be
debated.</p>
            <p>The Act of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. (which we say forbids
the Clergy to confer about making any Canons
without the King's Licence first obtained) was
made at the Petition of the Clergy, and in
the very words of that Petition: And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they were good Judges of the Sense of their
own Petition, and how far they meant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
themselves. And we find that the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:51550:102"/>
Years after, 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. (therefore several of them
the same Persons at whose Petition the Act
was made) do most humbly desire, that the
King's Licence for them may be obtained ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Effect of the said Statutes, (25
and 27) authorising them <hi>to attempt, entreat and
commune of such Matters, and therein freely to
give their Consents, which otherwise they may not do
upon pain and peril premised,</hi> that is, of being
fined and imprisoned during the King's Will.</p>
            <p>And now we come to the Act it self, which
recites in the Preamble the Petition and Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Clergy, wherein they promise, <hi>in
verbo Sacerdotii, That they never from henceforth
would presume to attempt, alledg, claim, enact,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>any new Canons, Constitutions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>unless the
King's Licence may be to them had, to make,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>the same, and his Majesty do give his most Royal
Assent and Authority in that behalf. And be it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
according to the Submission,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That the
Clergy shall not presume to attempt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>unless
they have the King's most Royal Assent and Licence
to make,</hi> &amp;c. So that it's evident the King's
Licence is antecedently necessary to their mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or even attempting (which includes all
conferring or debating in order to the making)
any new Canons; and that they are to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
unless they have the King's Authority
on that behalf. And none but our Author can
be so absurd as to think the King's confirming
the Canons the Convocation has made, is a
Licence to them to make, or attempt the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
new ones: Is the King's signing an Act
a Licence to the Parliament to make a new
one? But the Author's Ingenuity in reciting
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:51550:103"/>
this Act, and his Reasoning upon it, is much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</p>
            <p>14. The Author demands, Why are the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
called to a Convocation, if when they come
they are not to act?</p>
            <p>The Convocation was once a Limb of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Writ they are now summoned
by, is not much different from that of the
Commons; and no doubt did then meet, were
Adjourned, Prorogued, Dissolved with the
rest of the Parliament; and this continued till
<hi>H.</hi> 8. when they lost all their Parliamentary
Rights but of Taxing themselves, for the doing
of which they were still summoned according
to the Antient Form; and tho they have now
lost that Right too, and so the Reason of sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning
wholly ceaseth, yet the Writs are is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
out still after the same manner. It is not
their being summoned by this Writ that alone
makes them a Synod for Ecclesiastical Matters:
for in the Popish Times they were always sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
with the rest of the Parliament, yet
they were not a Synod, nor could not act as
such without Authority from the Pope; and
instead of any such Authority now, the King
makes them a Synod, and gives them Power to
enact Canons by Licence under the Broad-Seal:
and this with Submission I take to be the true
state of the Case.</p>
            <p>15. As to the third, that a Convocation is as
essential and necessary to the Church and Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
and binds all People in Ecclesiasticals, as
a Parliament does in Temporals: I answer.</p>
            <p>If the Clergy have another Right to make
Canons besides the Will of the Legislative Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:51550:103"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> a Divine Right, their Canons would
be valid without the King's confirming them;
nor could an Act of Parliament abrogate or
annul any of those Canons made by a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Authority; which is so far from depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on theirs, that the Parliament it self is
subject to them in those Matters; nor could
they hinder them from sitting when, and as long
as they had a Mind to, because they that have a
Divine Right to make Ecclesiastical Laws, must
have the same Right to sit in order to make
them, which is but necessary to the making
them: and in a word, they must be as absolute
and independant in all things relating to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticals,
as the Lay-state is in Civils; but
there cannot be two Independant or Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Powers about the same or different things,
for then People would be obliged to obey contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Commands about the same things, or different
Commands at the same Time, which is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible;
but that Power which can annul the
Commands of the other, must be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in all Cases, and be alone Supreme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
as great a Power is required to take off
as to lay on. If therefore the Civil Power can
annul any Ecclesiastical Laws, the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
can have no Power but what is dependant
on theirs, which they can abridg, curtail, or
annul, as they think fit; therefore it's absurd
to pretend that a Convocation has the same
Rights or Privileges, or is as essential to the
Constitution as a Parliament, without whose
Authority no Laws relating to Church or State
can be made. And a Convocation is so far from
being necessary to make Laws for the Church,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:51550:104"/>
that it's usurping the Rights of the English
Churches, or Christian People of <hi>England,</hi> who
are to be tied up by no Laws about indifferent
things (which alone are subject to humane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire)
whether of a Civil or Ecclesiastical Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but by their own Consent given in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And I know no Law of Christianity
that deprives them of this Right, which from
the first spreading of the Gospel here they have
always claimed. There were no Laws in the
British and Saxon Times that concerned the
whole Church, but (as our Historians testify)
were made by the same Power that made the
Temporal Laws, and were put in execution by
the same Persons. The tearing the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Power from the Temporal was the cursed
Root of Antichrist; those Powers were not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
in <hi>England,</hi> nor in most Nations, till the
See of <hi>Rome</hi> got the Ascendant; then, and not
till then, did the Clergy attempt to bind the
Laity by those Laws they never consented to:
but their design was never brought to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for such was the Genius of a Government
built upon this noble Foundation, <hi>That no Man
ought to be bound by a Law he does not consent to,</hi>
that as muffled up in Darkness and Superstition as
our Ancestors were, yet that Notion seemed to
be so strongly engraven in their Nature that
nothing could deface it; and accordingly we
often find them protesting that this and the
other thing does not bind them because done
without their Consent<note n="*" place="bottom">Rot. Parl. 40 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. Num. 7, 8. Rot. Parl. 5. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. Art. 46. Rot. Parl. 6 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. Num. 62.</note>; that they would not be
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:51550:104"/>
bound by any Ordinances of the Clergy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their Assent; that they would not subject
themselves to the Clergy no more than their
Ancestors had done: And 25 <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 21. they
tell the King, that besides Acts of Parliament,
<hi>The People are bound by no other Laws but what they
have taken at their free Liberty by their own Consent
to be used amongst them, and have bound themselves
by long Vse and Custom to the observance of the
same.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No marvel if we find this People submitting
to nothing in Religion, but what was ordained
by themselves. <hi>De majoribus omnes,</hi> was one of
their Fundamental Constitutions before they
came hither<note n="†" place="bottom">Tacitus de Moribus Germanorum, <hi>C.</hi> 11.</note>, and so it has continued to this
Day; and Matters of Religion were amongst
their <hi>Majora,</hi> even before they received Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.
And what neither the Pagan nor Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Priests could cheat or scare them from,
our Author will find a hard Matter to harangue
them out of. If no Canon is valid that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Custom or Law of this Realm;
How can a Canon oblige contrary to this most
antient Custom and Fundamental part of the
Constitution of the Peoples being obliged by no
Laws but of their own making? What's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of the boasted English Liberty, if they
may be excommunicated, and consequently
imprisoned for Contempt or Disobedience to a
Law they never made?</p>
            <p>This, I think, is sufficient to show the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volousness
of our Author's Reasons for making
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51550:105"/>
his Majesty guilty of the breach of his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-Oath,
in denying those Rights to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
he pretends are their due; which I
think I have proved to be contrary both to the
Law of God and the Realm. I shall therefore
conclude, praying that <hi>the God of Patience would
grant</hi> that no Priests of this Man's Principles,
in or out of Convocation, may hinder Men from
<hi>being like-minded one to another,</hi> nor disturb the
Peace of Church or State.</p>
