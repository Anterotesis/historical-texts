            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THeſe are the Words of Holy <hi>Job,</hi> who was an eminent Example, both of ſuffering Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and of Patience under it.</p>
            <p>If we look into the beginning of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we ſhall find that he was in a very proſperous and flouriſhing State and Condition; and yet a very upright Holy Man. Greatneſs and Goodneſs are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rare Conjunctions, but they met together in him: When he was full, he did not forget God, neither when he waxed fat, did he (<hi>Jeſhurun</hi> like) kick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: His temporal Riches did not impoveriſh his Soul, the World did not alienate his Affections from God, which greatly evidenc'd the Strength and Vigour of his Grace; but if we fix our Eyes upon the latter part of the Chapter, we ſhall ſee a great and

ſudden alteration made in his outward State, he ſoon rolled down the Mount of Proſperity into the loweſt Vale of Adverſity; one Meſſenger treads upon the heels of another, bringing doleful Tidings concerning the flight of his outward Comforts from him, and the laſt Meſſenger was laden with the heavieſt Tidings, who brought the News of his Childrens death, by a terrible ſtroke of God's hand. A Man's Children are more valuable than all his worldly Subſtance; they are a part of himſellf, Fleſh of his Fleſh, and Bone of his Bone. The loſs of an Eſtate is like the plucking off a Garment, the loſs of a Child is like the tearing off a Limb from the Body. God ſeemed to empty this good Man from Veſſel to Veſſel, to lay Stripe upon Stripe: Deep called unto Deep at the Noiſe of <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s Water ſpouts, and if not all, yet a great many of his Waves and Billows paſſed over him. It was certainly very terrible unto him, and muſt needs be ſo to us, for God to repeat his ſtrokes, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply our Afflictions; before we have ended our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations for the loſs of one outward Comfort, to behold and attend the Funeral of another. Before I paſs this, give me leave to Obſerve, <hi>That ſharp and ſore Afflictions are often times the Lot of God's deareſt Children in this Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They who have a large room in God's Heart, are often very ſeverely Diſciplin'd by his Rod: They who do moſt carefully eſchew the evil of ſin, are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exercis'd with the evil of Suffering. Let us make this profitable Uſe of this Note, <hi>viz. Not to conclude our ſelves to be the Objects either of Divine Love or Hatred, from any of the external Diſpenſations of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence towards us.</hi> We cannot Warrantably draw any ſuch Concluſions from ſuch Premiſes. God may load thee with Common Benefits, and yet not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29932:4"/>
thee with the Favour which he bears to his own People: He may Viſit thee with great Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and yet thou may'ſt be Viſited with his ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Salvation here, and his Eternal Salvation hereafter. Thy Wife may be as a Fruitful Vine, thy Sons like Plants grown up in their Youth, and thy Daughters as Corner ſtones poliſhed after the ſimilitude of a Palace, and yet thou may'ſt not be broken off from the wild Olive-tree of Corrupt Nature, nor engraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Chriſt the Noble Vine and the good Olive-tree: Thy Root may be dry, and thy Branches wither and be lopt off, the Deſire of thine Eyes, and the Fruit of thy Body, may be taken away by terrible ſtrokes, and yet God may be the ſtrength of thy Heart and thy Portion for ever.</p>
            <p>Now let us Obſerve <hi>Job</hi>'s Carriage and Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under this dark and gloomy Providence; and this may be gathered both from his Geſtures and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> From his Geſtures, <hi>Ver.</hi> 20. <hi>Then Job aroſe, and rent his Mantle, and ſhaved his Head, and fell down upon the ground and worſhipped:</hi> His renting his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſhaving his Head, were ſigns of his great Sorrow. When <hi>Jacob</hi> ſuppoſed <hi>Joſeph</hi> to be dead, he immediately rent his Garment, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. ch. 34. v. And after <hi>Abner</hi>'s Death, <hi>David</hi> to expreſs his Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, rent his Cloaths, and commanded all the People that were with him to do the like, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. ch. 31. v. And we find that Baldneſs is often joined with Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Weeping in the Scriptures; <hi>Cut off thine Hair, O Jeruſalem, caſt it away, and take up a Lamentation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.29. ſo <hi>Amos</hi> 8.10. <hi>Mich.</hi> 1.16. and ſeveral other places. His falling down upon the ground and Worſhipping, were ſigns of that Honour and Homage which he tender'd unto God, in and under the Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29932:5"/>
It is very Obſervable how <hi>Job</hi> divides himſelf between his outward Comforts and his God, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer have his Sorrow, to the latter he gives Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> From his Expreſſions, <hi>Ver.</hi> 21. Words are, or ought to be, the Interpreters of our Hearts, and a Comment upon our Actions. Leaſt ſome obſerving <hi>Job</hi> in ſuch a Poſture, might think that he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide himſelf, and thrown into a Frenzy by theſe dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tidings, he declares the Frame of his Heart, and the meaning of theſe forementioned Actions, by theſe following Expreſſions; <hi>Naked came I out of my Mothers Womb, and naked ſhall I return thither.</hi> Theſe Words are, as I conceive, uſed by him as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſupport his own Spirit under his preſent Afflictions; <hi>q. d.</hi> Altho' I am now in a Naked Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſtript and depriv'd of mine outward Comforts, yet, I have no Cauſe to Murmur, for I brought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing into the World, neither can I carry any thing with me out of it; and then, ſays he, in the Words of my Text, <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Words may be divided into two general Parts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Two Propoſitions, <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A natural and neceſſary Inference and Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from them both, <hi>Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall ſpeak to both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Two Propoſitions or Aſſertions. (1.) <hi>The Lord gave.</hi> (2.) <hi>The Lord hath taken away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The Lord gave:</hi> q. d. The Lord gave me thoſe Outward Comforts and Enjoyments; that Wealth, thoſe ſervants and Children which I lately had, but am now bereaved of. From hence I ſhall Obſerve,</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:29932:5"/>
            <p rend="italic">
               <label>Doct.</label> That all our Outward Comforts and Temporal Enjoyments come from, and are the Gift of God.</p>
            <p>God is the giver of every good and perfect Gift, <hi>James</hi> 1.17. Not only of the beſt and moſt perfect Gifts, but alſo of thoſe that are good and perfect in their kind. Temporal as well as Spiritual and Eternal Bleſſings are ſtreams flowing from this Fountain of Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>In the Proſecution of this Point I ſhall do two things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Lay down ſome Explicatory and Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Preſent you with ſome Practical Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Inferences.</p>

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall lay down ſome Explicatory and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>Firſt Prop. <hi>The God is the efficient Cauſe of all our Creature Comforts:</hi> Every good thing that we enjoy is God's Creature; for as every Creature of God is good, ſo nothing is good but what is his Creature. Sin which is eſſentially evil, is not God's but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's Creature. Our near and dear Relations muſt own God only for their Creator. Though Parents are the Inſtrumental Cauſes, yet God is the Principal Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cauſe of their Children's Beings; though their Bodies were formed of their ſubſtance, yet they were formed by God's Omnipotent Arm; by him they were fearfully and wonderfully made, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.14. and he animated and informed them with a rational Soul, therefore is he called <hi>the Father of Spirits,</hi> Heb. 12.9. and <hi>the God of the Spirits of all fleſh,</hi> Numb. 16.22. Hence,</p>
            <p>Second Prop. <hi>God hath an Original Right to, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in them:</hi> He muſt needs be the ſole Proprietor of thoſe things whereof he is the ſole Creator. Thoſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29932:6"/>
Bodies and Souls muſt needs be his, who derived their Being from him. The firſt Cauſe of every thing hath an unqueſtionable Dominion of Propriety in it upon the ſcore of Juſtice. By the Law of Nations, the firſt Finder of a Countrey is eſteemed the Rightful Poſſeſſor of that Countrey: And the firſt Inventor of an Art hath a right of exerciſing it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>All the Outward Comforts which we enjoy, were beſtowed upon us by God;</hi> they being Created by him, and he being the rightful Lord of them, we cannot enjoy them 'till we receive them from him: The Right and Title which we have to them is not Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive but Derivative. Some of our Relations (at leaſt) might have had an Exiſtence, and yet we might not have had an Intereſt in them. Haſt thou a good Husband or Wife? as God's Creating Power gave them being, ſo his wiſe and gracious Providence made them thine. He allotts one Perſon for a Conjugal Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with another, and by his Providence, and that ſometimes very ſtrangely and wonderfully, brings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout and effects it.</p>
            <p>Fourth Prop. <hi>All thoſe excellent Qualities which any of our Outward Enjoyments are the ſubjects of, whereby they are rendered very Comfortable and Delightful to us, proceed from God:</hi> All the natural and acquired En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of the Body and Mind, which endear Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to us, as Beauty, Ingenuity, a good Natural Temper and Diſpoſition, as well as Grace, which is a ſupernatural Endowment of the Soul, are beſtowed upon them, by the Fountain of all Perfections. He curiouſly formed their Bodies, and dignified their Minds with theſe Intellectual Qualities.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Whatſoever we receive from God, flows from the Free Grace and Sovereign Goodneſs of God:</hi> This is indeed the proper Notion of a Gift; It is a good thing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29932:6"/>
freely beſtowed upon us. When we receive ſome good from another which he is not Obliged to give us, it may properly be ſtyled a Gift. Now in this ſenſe all our Temporal as well as our Spiritual Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are the Gifts of the Supream Being: He is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no Engagement or Obligation to any of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but what he voluntarily and freely enters into and lays himſelf under: We are leſs than the leaſt of his Mercies, and unworthy of the ſmalleſt of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. Have any of us a Wife, Children, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Relations, which greatly add to the Comfort of our Lives, we muſt ſay concerning them, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did to his Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> concerning his Children, theſe <hi>God hath graciouſly given thy Servant,</hi> Gen. 33.5.</p>
            <p>Sixth Prop. <hi>When God beſtows any Outward Comforts upon us, he doth not diveſt himſelf of, nor make over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us an abſolute Propriety in them.</hi> Among Men there are ſeveral ſorts of Gifts, or ſeveral ways of giving: Sometimes Men cannot be ſaid to retain any Right to thoſe things which they have given unto another: All the right to the Gift paſſeth over from the Giver to the Receiver by Vertue of the Donation; and the Perſon that gave it, cannot without a Breach of the Rules of Juſtice reaſſume it, without the Receiver's full Conſent. But other things are ſo given by Men, that they ſtill retain their right to and Propriety in them, or indeed they are rather lent than given: We have an Inſtance hereof in Places of Profit and Truſt, which are beſtowed by Princes upon their Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, during their Pleaſure: This Donation is not abſolute, ſo as to diveſt the Sovereign of his Right to them, for he can take them away when he pleaſes, without committing any Act of Injuſtice. And of this latter ſort of Gifts are thoſe outward Comforts which we receive from God. He did not diveſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29932:7"/>
of the Propriety when he granted us the Uſe. Our Relations are His, and not Ours, even when they are in ſome ſenſe Ours: Though they may be Ours in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Men, yet they are not Ours in oppoſition to God; they are granted us only for our Uſe, as the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of Eſſes, and Sword, and other Enſigns of the Chief Magiſtrate in the City paſs through many Hands in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Uſe of them, but the Propriety remains in the Community and Body of the City. I ſhall now</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Preſent you with ſome Practical Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory Inferences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Hence I Inferr, <hi>That God is more excellent, and conſequently ought to be more highly prized and valued by us than any of our Outward Comforts:</hi> The Donor muſt needs tranſcend the Gift in Worth and Value: It is impoſſible for us perfectly to Conceive how far God tranſcends in Excellency thoſe good things which we receive from him: And the more excellent any Object is, the greater ſhare ought we to give it in our Eſteem and Love. We are all too prone to ſet up our outward Comforts in competition with God, to ſet them down in the Throne of our Hearts, a Seat only becoming the Father of Spirits. Let us make all our Temporal En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments ſtrike Sail to that Supream Being who gave them; let him be the Darling of our Souls, and the Sovereign of our Affections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hence I Inferr, <hi>That we ought thankfully to aſcribe the Glory of all the good things which we enjoy, to God:</hi> We muſt not Sacrifice to our own Net, nor burn Incenſe to our own Drag: We muſt not attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute thoſe outward Comforts which we are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of, to our ſelves or any of our Fellow Creatures as the principal Cauſes of them; but muſt own them to be the Gifts of God, and bleſs his Name for them. His Goodneſs to us Calls for our Thankfulneſs, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29932:7"/>
his Soveraignty over us Calls for an higher Elevation of it. A Smile from a Prince is more valued, and thought worthy of greater Gratitude than a Preſent from a Peaſant. What is Man, that Thou ſo great a Soveraign art mindful of him, to beſtow this or that Favour upon him! is but a due reflection upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bleſſing that we receive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Hence I Inferr, <hi>That all our Outward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts ſhould be Improved by us to the Glory of God.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more reaſonable, than that he who is the firſt Cauſe ſhould be the laſt End, than that what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon us by Divine Bounty ſhould be Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by us to God's Glory. We ought not to Napkin up, but to lay out our Talents; and ſuch are all our Outward Comforts, we receive them as Stewards, and therefore muſt be accountable for them to our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Lord. O that when he ſhall Call us to give an Account of our Stewardſhips, and we muſt be no longer Stewards, we may give up our Accounts with Joy and not with Grief.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to the Second Propoſition laid down in my Text; <hi>The Lord hath taken away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There ſeems to be ſomething of difficulty in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Aſſertion: You will be ready to ſay, Was it not told <hi>Job</hi> by the Meſſengers, that the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> and <hi>Sabeans</hi> came and took away his Cattel, and plunder'd and pillaged his Eſtate, that the Fire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed his Sheep and his Servants, and the Wind blew down the Houſe upon his Children, and had not Satan a hand in all this? How then could <hi>Job</hi> charge this upon God? Doth not this look like the Blaſphemy which the Devil expected out of his Mouth? I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Hereby <hi>Job</hi> only ſets forth the Supream Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Sovereignty of God, in ordering all things; and ſhews that the Devil, Wicked Men, and other ſecond
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29932:8"/>
Cauſes, could not have effected theſe things without a Divine Concurſe. And this was no Stain to the Holineſs of God, nor any reflection upon his Juſtice; for that Action which is impure and unrighteous in the Creature, is holy and righteous in God. Tho' Men injuriouſly diſpoſſeſs us of our outward Comforts, God doth it juſtly; tho' Men's Ends are baſe and ſordid, God's are Noble and Excellent. From this Branch of the Words I ſhall preſent you with the two following Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That there is a Viciſſitude and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainty in all our Outward Comforts and Temporal Enjoyments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That when we are deprived of any of our Outward Comforts, we muſt acknowledge the Efficiency of God therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt Prop. <hi>That there is a Viciſſitude and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in all our Outward Comforts and Temporal Enjoyments:</hi> Though ſpiritual Bleſſings are ſtable and durable, theſe Gifts of God are ſo without Repentance, that they ſhall never be taken away from us; yet Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is written in legible Characters upon all our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral good things: They are not only Vanity becauſe they cannot ſatisfie us while we have them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are tranſitory and ſhort-liv'd. When our Mountain ſeems to ſtand ſtrong, it is a vain thing for us to ſay, We ſhall never be moved. We may upon this account ſay of all Outward Comforts in general as the Wiſe Man doth of Riches in particular, <hi>They are not,</hi> becauſe they <hi>make themſelves Wings, and fly away as an Eagle towards Heaven,</hi> Prov. 23.5. <hi>Job</hi> had Cattel and Children, but now they were all gone from him; our living Comforts are dying Comforts. Death frequently rends thoſe from Men's Embraces who were of all Mortals neareſt and deareſt to them; this is a Truth which almoſt every Day's Obſervation will
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29932:8"/>
ſufficiently demonſtrate to us. Do not we ſee them who had Children one day, Childleſs the next; and thoſe who had Wives one day, to be Widdowers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the next? Let us ſtrike this Rock, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we cannot fetch Water from it; let us look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Bowels of this Lyon, that we may find ſome Honey in it; let us conſider what Improvement may be made of this doleful Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Hence I Inferr, <hi>How unreaſonable it is for any of the Children of Men to place their Happineſs in the fruition of Temporal good things:</hi> This is a great evil under the Sun, that which the generality of Mankind are guilty of; but did they act like reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they would not place their Felicity in thoſe things which are fading and uncertain, but in thoſe things which are durable and laſting. Oh that I could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf, and you from this Piece of Folly! Have we Relations who are extraordinary Comforts to us, let us not make them our chief good, nor eſteem them our higheſt Happineſs, for within a few dayes their Breath may be ſtopt, and how miſerable ſhall we then be, not only in reality, but even in our own Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions! then ſhall we ſay with <hi>Micah</hi> when the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> had taken away his Idol and his Prieſt, <hi>What have I more?</hi> Judges 18.24. Let us make God our higheſt Happineſs, and place our Felicity in Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to and Communion with him, and in the Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of him, who is an unchangable and an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, whoſe Perfections never leave him, and who never leaves any that truly enjoy him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hence I Inferr, <hi>That we ought diligently to improve our Outward Comforts, while they are continued with us:</hi> I ſhall inſtance particularly in Relations. Let us do what good we can to them, let us Inſtruct them in the things of God and the great Concerns of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29932:9"/>
World; let us as much as in us lies endeavour the Salvation of their Souls, and let us ſtrive to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what good we can from them, for we know not how ſpeedily Death may make a ſeparation between us and them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Hence I Inferr, <hi>That when we enjoy any Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Comforts, we ought to be continually expecting and preparing for the loſs of them:</hi> Let us not think that we ſhall always enjoy them, but look upon them as fading and uncertain; let us endeavour to wean our ſelves from them, to uſe them as if we uſed them not: In this reſpect, let thoſe who have Wives and Children be as if they had none. That Affliction which comes unlookt for, uſually comes unprepar'd for: The more looſe we ſit from our outward Comforts when we have them, the more eaſily ſhall we part with them. <hi>Jacob</hi> could better part with his ten other Sons into the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> than with his <hi>Benjamin,</hi> that almoſt brought his grey Hairs with Sorrow to the Grave. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if we immoderately grieve for thoſe things when abſent, which we immoderately Love when preſent: By dying daily to them, let us prepare to follow them to their Graves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I Inferr, <hi>How unreaſonable it is for us to be ſurprized, when any of our outward Comforts are removed from us:</hi> Theſe fiery Tryals ſhould not be thought ſtrange of by us, for no ſtrange thing hath happened to us. If we thought them durable, we were miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken about them; and if we thought them uncertain and vaniſhing, why ſhould we be ſurprized when they diſappear? It was an excellent ſaying of a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, when one told him of his Son's Death, <hi>Sciebam me genuiſſe mortales,</hi> I knew that I begat Mortals. O Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, did not ye know that your Daughter! O Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, did not you know that your Wife was a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal!
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29932:9"/>
be not then ſurprized at her Diſſolution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly</hi> and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Hence I Inferr, <hi>That we ought all of us to prepare for our own removal from our Relations.</hi> As our Relations who are Comforts to us, ſo we who are Comforts to them, are fading Dying Creatures: How ſoon our living Relations may walk the Streets in Mourning for us, as we have done for thoſe who are already gone to their long Home, we know not. The daily Inſtances of Humane Frailty which are given us, ſhould put us upon Conſidering and Preparing for our latter End, that we may not be hurried from our Relations Embraces into everlaſting Flames, but may enter into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom. Let none of us deferr the great Work of Preparation for Death, for we know not how ſoon we may enter into its gloomy ſhades. <hi>Job</hi>'s Children were ſnatcht away ſuddenly, and ſo are many others. Death is not always uſher'd in with the formality of a long and lingring Sickneſs. Our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Friend did not lye long upon her Bed of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, but was quickly carried off the Stage by that Diſtemper which ſeized upon her. It is not long ſince ſhe was Worſhipping God with us in this Aſſembly, and now ſhe is gone into the Congregation of the Dead: <hi>Therefore be ye alſo ready, for in ſuch an hour as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh,</hi> Matth. 24.44. Let not thoſe who are Young put off this Buſineſs of higheſt Concernment to Old Age, for young ones are often taken away by the ſtroke of Death. Our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Friend was like a pleaſant Flower, in her bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Age, blaſted by the Wind of Death; the Days of her appointed time were but few, before her Change came: Remember therefore your Creator, Oh young Ones! in the dayes of your Youth, for it may be ye may not live 'till Old Age comes: Your Maker may ſoon take you away. Get an Intereſt in Chriſt, who hath aboliſhed Death, and brought Life and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29932:10"/>
to light by the Goſpel: So when you come to dye, may ye chearfully reſign your Souls to him, and he will receive them into his Divine Embraces. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever your Judgments are now, when you come to lye upon a Death bed, you will think an Intereſt in Chriſt more valuable than the whole World, if you are not extreamly ſtupified. The Hopes which our Deceaſed Friend had of this, carried her comfortably through the Valley of the ſhadow of Death. Thus much for the firſt Propoſition.</p>
            <p>Second Prop. <hi>That when we are deprived of any of our Outward Comforts, we muſt acknowledge the Efficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God therein. The Lord hath taken away.</hi> Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is the Inſtrumental, God is the Efficient Cauſe of all our Afflictions. The <hi>Manichees</hi> of old tell us of two Beginnings, or two Gods, the one a good God, and the other an evil God; the former they aſſerted to be the Author of all Good, and the latter to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all Evil; the former they called <hi>A giving God,</hi> and the latter <hi>A taking God:</hi> But my Text will ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently confute that horrid Notion, for <hi>Job</hi> aſcribes the Donation and the Removal of his Outward Comforts to the ſame Divine Being, as the firſt Cauſe of both; and indeed it was neceſſary that he ſhould do ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is but one God. Yea, many Heathens taught better Doctrine than theſe Hereticks; for they feigned that their great <hi>Jupiter</hi> had two great Veſſels placed at the Entrance of his Palace, whereof the one was filled with Good, and the other with Evil, and theſe he diſpenſed according to the Dictates of his own Will, among the Children of Men. But not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you with Poetical Fictions, the Scriptures frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſert this Truth; ſays God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.9. <hi>I form the light, and create darkneſs; I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all theſe things:</hi> Says the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.38. <hi>Out of the mouth of the moſt high proceedeth not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29932:10"/>
evil and good!</hi> When any of our dear Relations are taken away by Death, they fall by the ſtroke of God's Hand; ſays God to the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel, Son of Man, behold I take away from thee the Deſire of thine Eyes, with a ſtroke,</hi> Ch. 24. v. 16. The Diſeaſes of which our Relations dye, are only the means w hereby God brings about his deſigned End, even their Diſſolution. Theſe Winds God holds in the Hollow of his Hand, and lets them looſe at his pleaſure, to blow poor Mortals from the River of Time into the Ocean of Eternity; and this is no Impeachment at all to Divine Goodneſs. Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments themſelves are not Moral Evils in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that inflicts, though they are Natural Evils in the Perſon that ſuffers them. I need not inſiſt farther upon the Proof of this Point, but ſhall preſent you with ſome Inferences from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Hence I Inferr, <hi>That when we are Threatned with the Privation of any of our Outward Comforts, it is our wiſeſt and ſafeſt way to apply our ſelves to God for the Continuance of them:</hi> We may allowably pray for, and deprecate the removal of our Temporal Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, provided we do it with Modeſty and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, with theſe neceſſary Limitations, If it be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Will, If it may be for his Glory and our good, to beſtow them upon us, or continue them with us. Though we may make uſe of all lawfull Means to obtain and preſerve Temporal good things, yet we muſt not forget to apply our ſelves unto God, whoſe Bleſſing alone can render them effectual. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians will be of no Value for the recovery of our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Relations, unleſs God ſends forth his Word and heals them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hence I Inferr, <hi>That they deſerve to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, who when they have ſuſtained any Loſſes, reflect upon, perplex themſelves about, and aſcribe thoſe Loſſes ſolely or principally to ſecond Cauſes:</hi> We are very prone
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29932:11"/>
in ſuch Caſes to blame Inſtruments, inſtead of eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Providence of the principal Efficient; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve all troubleſome Events into the malignity of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſes: This part of practical Atheiſm we are apt to be guilty of, thô common Obſervation might be ſufficient to Confute it. The ſame ſecond Cauſe which produces ſuch an effect at one time, or in one Perſon, ſhall not produce the like at another time, or upon another Perſon. Why ſhould we aſcribe the Death of our Relations principally to the Malignity of the Diſtemper wherewith they were ſeized, when we ſee others ſurviving the ſame Diſtemper, when at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the ſame dangerous Circumſtances?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I Inferr, <hi>That when any of our Outward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are taken away from us, we ſhould diligently enquire into the end and deſign of that ſeparation which hath been made between us and them.</hi> Tho' the Ends of Humane Acts are not always worthy of our ſearch and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet the ends of Divine Acts are always ſo: God hath Noble and Excellent Ends in all his Operations. Let us therefore at ſuch a time addreſs our ſelves to God in the words of Holy <hi>Job,</hi> 10. <hi>ch.</hi> 2. <hi>v. Shew me wherefore thou contendeſt with me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I Inferr, <hi>The Folly of thoſe who put their Truſt, and place their Confidence in any thing as a ſecurity from Death.</hi> Were they who go to their long Home only taken away by Men, then there might be ſome probability of warding off the fatal blow; but ſeeing they are taken away by God, what can prevent it? Can you think that the great Jehovah will be charm'd by your Beauty, or overpower'd by your Strength? Are there any Forts or Towers into which he cannot enter? Can you flie into any remote Countrey where his Arm cannot reach you? Will the Great God have any regard to your Worldly Riches, or Temporal Grandure? By none of theſe things can you deliver
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:29932:11"/>
either your own, or others Souls from Death, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from going down to the Pit. Thus much for the firſt part of the Words, I now proceed to the ſecond.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We have a Natural and Neceſſary Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or Concluſion, from both the forementioned Propoſitions, <hi>Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord:</hi> In which words we have two things contained, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, An Object, <hi>The Name of the Lord.</hi> This Phraſe hath various acceptations in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: But there are two things which I conceive may be intended by it in this place; and indeed the latter is plainly included in the former.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> By the Name of the Lord, is intended <hi>God himſelf.</hi> The Name of a Perſon, or Thing, is often put for the Perſon, or Thing named: Thus 1 <hi>Acts</hi> 15. <hi>The number of the Names together, were about an hundred and twenty;</hi> i. e. the number of Perſons, they being numbered by their Names: So 44 <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. and ſeveral other places.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By the Name of the Lord are intended <hi>the Attributes and Perfections of God:</hi> By them is his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture diſcovered unto his Creatures; and indeed all his Perfections are inſeparable from his Eſſence.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We have an Act which was exerted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Object, and that is <hi>Bleſſing.</hi> By bleſſing God, we are to underſtand, either what we expreſs in Words concerning God, or what we think concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. God is bleſſed by his Creatures, when his glorious Perfections are publiſhed with Praiſe and Thankſgiving; or when they have high, great and glorious Thoughts of him; when they inwardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, Honour and Love him: The former is a Bleſſing with the Tongue, the latter is a Bleſſing with the Heart; the Tongue bleſſing without the Heart, is but a tinkling Cymbal; the Heart bleſſing,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29932:12"/>
without the Tongue, makes ſweet, but ſtill Muſick: both in Conſort make that Harmony, which fills and delights both Heaven and Earth. When <hi>Job</hi> ſaith here, <hi>Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord,</hi> we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it both ways, <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks out the Bleſſing of God with his mouth, and likewiſe had high and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Thoughts of him: From theſe words I ſhall preſent you with the following Obſervation,</p>
            <p rend="italic">
               <label>Doct.</label> That it is the Duty, and will be the Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the People of God, when in a right frame of Spirit, to bleſs a taking as well as a giving God.</p>
            <p>This is indeed a very hard Work, but it is a very neceſſary Work: God's People are not at all times engaged in it, but they are ſo when in a right frame of Spirit. In the Proſecution of this Point, I ſhall take the following Method.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall more particularly ſhew you, what is intended by, or implyed in our Bleſſing a taking God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Endeavour the Proof and Demonſtration of the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Make ſome Improvement, and Application of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſhall more particularly ſhew you, what is intended by, or implyed in our bleſſing a taking God. This I ſhall do, by laying down the following Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
            <p>Firſt Prop. <hi>This is not excluſive of a holy mourning for the loſs of our Outward Comforts:</hi> At the ſame time that we bleſs God who hath taken away what we once enjoyed, we may Mourn for our Loſs. Theſe two (as plainly appears from the Text and Context) were joined together by <hi>Job;</hi> and their Conjunction was approved by God, as appears from the words
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29932:12"/>
following my Text, <hi>In all this Job ſinned not, nor char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged God fooliſhly.</hi> Mourning is allowable, if we exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe a Chriſtian Moderation therein.</p>
            <p>Second Prop. <hi>Our Afflictions are not in themſelves the proper Subject of Thankſgiving.</hi> Outward Comforts being in themſelves good things, the loſs of them ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely conſidered, is an evil: Now the proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Praiſe is ſomething that is Good.</p>
            <p>Third Prop. <hi>Bleſſing God is abſolutely excluſive of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directly oppoſite to every thing that is implyed in Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him:</hi> Bleſſing and Curſing are Oppoſites. To Curſe God, is to Blaſpheme him either in our thoughts or words; to think or ſpeak unworthily, or unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly of him: there is a Curſing God with the Heart, as well as a Curſing him with the Lips. We Curſe God, when our Hearts are imbitter'd againſt him, or our Tongues ſharpen'd to wound his Honour: Therefore they that Bleſs him, will not either think or ſpeak unbecomingly of him; they will not either mentally or verbally Murmur and repine at him; they will not Queſtion his Juſtice, Reproach his Goodneſs, or Accuſe his Providence.</p>
            <p>Fourth Prop. <hi>Bleſſing God implies the Exerciſe of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and our thinking and ſpeaking honourably of God under affliction:</hi> The Soul who bleſſes God, accounts and acknowledges God to be glorious in Holineſs, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Goodneſs and Truth, when he ſtrips him of his Outward Comforts; he juſtifies God in all his Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with him; the Language of both his Heart and his Lips is the ſame with <hi>David</hi>'s, <hi>Thou haſt dealt well with thy Servant, according to thy Word,</hi> Pſal. 119.65.</p>
            <p>Fifth Prop. <hi>This includes our offering up Praiſe and Thankſgiving to God under, if not for our Afflictions:</hi> He that thus Bleſſes God, will Praiſe his Name when he <hi>takes</hi> as well as when he <hi>gives;</hi> he will return Thanks for thoſe Mercies which are ſtill continued with him,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29932:13"/>
though he mourns for the removal of others from him; yea, if he obſerves Mercy either in the Circumſtances of the Affliction, or in the Iſſue and Event of it, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to offer up the Sacrifice of Praiſe to God, even when he hangs his Harp upon the Willows. I Proceed</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To Prove and Demonſtrate the Point, and this I ſhall do more Generally and more Particularly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> More Generally: <hi>God is to be Bleſſed by us at all times, and therefore when he deprives us of our Outward Comforts as well as when he gives them to us:</hi> This is evident from the Nature of God, our Relation to him, and the Revelations and Diſcoveries which he hath made of his Will to us. Is God the moſt excellent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? ſurely we who ſtand related to him, as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to a Creator, and as Subjects to a Sovereign, are Obliged at all times to Glorifie him, not by making him glorious, but by accounting and acknowledging him to be glorious our ſelves, and Proclaiming him to be ſo unto others. Is not Praiſe and Thankſgiving due from us to him at all times? unleſs he could ceaſe to be God, or we ceaſe to be Creatures, we can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no Circumſtances be freed from our Obligation to glorifie the Perfections of his Nature. Thoſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Diſpenſations of Divine Providence which make a great Alteration in our Outward State and Condition, neither make nor argue any Change in God. He is the ſame when he takes and when he gives, when he empties us and when he fills us. To ſuppoſe him a good God at one time, and an evil God at another, is a flat Contradiction; it is to ſuppoſe him not to be God: And hath he not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently prohibited thoſe things which are excluded by, and Commanded thoſe things which are implyed in Bleſſing a taking God. They muſt be greatly unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Holy Scriptures who are Ignorant hereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall more particularly demonſtrate, that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29932:13"/>
this Concluſion naturally and neceſſarily flows from the preceding Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>We ought to Bleſs a taking as well as a giving God, Becauſe the ſame God who takes them away from us, firſt gave them to us.</hi> The force of this Argument will be apparent from the two following Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That God who gave them to us, hath an unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable right to take them away from us:</hi> As I told you before, he retained his Propriety in them, when he had beſtowed them upon us, and may not God do what he pleaſes with his own? We may ſuppoſe <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaking to God after this manner, Lord, Thou haſt depriv'd me of my Wealth and my Children, but I will ſubſcribe to the Equity of thy Proceedings with me, for thou doſt but exerciſe thy Sovereign Right, thou gaveſt them to me, and yet ſtill they remained thine, therefore thou haſt righteouſly taken them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from me.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>When God takes our Outward Comforts from us, we have reaſon to Bleſs him for giving them to us.</hi> We are very prone to be guilty of this piece of Ingratitude towards both God and Man, our Creator and our fellow Creatures; if they ſhew Kindneſs to us for a time, and refuſe the Continuance thereof, inſtead of thanking them to quarrel with them. Let none of us ſay, when any of our Enjoyments are ſnatcht away from us, Better we had never enjoy'd them, than to be ſo ſoon depriv'd of them. Haſt thou loſt a Child, a comfortable Child, a Child in its ripe Age? thou haſt reaſon to bleſs God that he gave thee a Child, that he made it a Comfort which might have been a Croſs to thee, and hath continued it ſo long with thee: Haſt thou loſt a delightful Wife, one that was a Help Meet for thee? thou haſt reaſon to bleſs God that he gave thee ſuch a Wife, who might have given thee one that would have been a Continual Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29932:14"/>
and Vexation to thee, and that he hath ſpared her ſo long with you.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>We ought to Bleſs a taking God; becauſe it is the Lord Jehovah who takes our Outward Comforts from us. The Lord hath taken away.</hi> The Lord, who can do no wrong to any of his Creatures. The Lord, who is Righteous in all his Ways, and Holy in all his Works. The Lord, againſt whom we have ſinned, and by our ſins forfeited all our Mercies. The Lord, who had he dealt with us according to our Iniquities, or reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us according to our Inventions, might have caſt us into Hell long ago. The Lord, who is our God. The Lord, who hath done great things for our Souls, who is an alſufficient unchangable and everlaſting Good, who can make up the Loſs of Creature Comforts in himſelf. The Lord, who knows what Condition is good for us, better than we do our ſelves, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages all things according to the Dictates of his Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom. The Lord, whoſe ways are all Mercy and Truth to his People, and aims at their Good as well as his own Glory in all his Diſpenſations towards them, who will ſupport them under Afflictions, and ſanctifie Afflictions unto them. I proceed</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To make ſome Improvement and Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Point, which ſhall be only an Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all in general, and you the Relations of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Friend in particular, to this Neceſſary Duty of Bleſſing a Taking God.</p>
            <p>To enforce this I might preſent you with many Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, but I ſhall only offer you two, which ſhall be taken from the Context of that Scripture which is the Foundation of this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Hereby you will Diſappoint Satan:</hi> What was the Devil's deſign againſt <hi>Job,</hi> in endeavouring the removal of his Outward Comforts, but to make him Curſe God? as is evident from <hi>Ver.</hi> 11. of this Chap.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:29932:14"/>
and queſtionleſs he is in the ſame Plot againſt us, when in the like Condition: He would fain Create ſome Prejudices againſt God in our Minds, or draw ſome unbecoming Reflections upon him from our Lips: Now as his Deſign againſt <hi>Job</hi> was defeated, when inſtead of Curſing God he Bleſs'd him, ſo will his Plot againſt us miſcarry if we do the like; and ſhall not we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to fruſtrate his Deſigns who is an implacable Enemy both to our God and to us?</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Hereby you will pleaſe God.</hi> That this Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of <hi>Job</hi>'s was well-pleaſing to God, is apparent from his expreſs Approbation thereof in the words following my Text; <hi>In all this Job ſinned not, neither charged God fooliſhly.</hi> This is a Negative Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion incluſive of an Affirmative one; <hi>q. d.</hi> In all this <hi>Job</hi> acted becomingly, ſuitably to the Character which I have given of him, and ought it not to be our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in all things to pleaſe God? More particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you my Friends whoſe Loſs hath occaſioned this Diſcourſe, have cauſe to be thankful as well as to Mourn under that ſtroke of God's Hand which hath been lately laid upon you: God hath even in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remembred Mercy with you, in that he did not take away your Relation by a Violent, but by a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Death; the former is more terrible than the latter, not only to thoſe who undergo it, but to their ſurviving Relatives. Moreover, though your dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was taken away in a ſhort time, after Sickneſs began to ſeize her, yet ſhe did not dye ſuddenly, God gave you ſome Warning before he gave that fatal blow which ſeparated her from your Embraces. Have you not reaſon to Bleſs God for thoſe Supports which he gave her, and thoſe Manifeſtations and Diſcoveries of his Love which he made to her in the time of her Sickneſs: Had ſhe been ſtupid and inſenſible of her Condition, or gone out of the World full of Horrour,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29932:15"/>
your Burthen would have been the greater, though then you ought to have acquieſc'd in the Will of God, but now you have good ground to Hope that ſhe is not loſt, but gone before; that your Loſs is her Gain; that ſhe was ſeparated from you only in order to her Enjoyment of her Heavenly Father, and her deareſt Husband, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; that ſhe is gone to that bleſſed Place, from whence ſhe would not for a World return to you: That though you have had a doleful Parting, you will have a joyful Meeting, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to part more. And would you Bleſs this taking God? ſeriouſly conſider thoſe things which I Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to you, to demonſtrate the reaſonableneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, endeavour to clear up your Intereſt in him, go forth by Faith to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that you may derive that Grace and Strength from him, which may enable you to do this difficult Work; ſo I hope you may ſay with the Holy Man in the Words of my Text, <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi>
