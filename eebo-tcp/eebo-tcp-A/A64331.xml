            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>ONE Labour more, O <hi>Arethusa,</hi> yield</l>
            <l>Before I leave the Shepherds and the Field:</l>
            <l>Some Verses to my <hi>Gallus</hi> e'er we part,</l>
            <l>Such as may one day break <hi>Lycoris</hi> Heart</l>
            <l>

As She did his. Who can refuse a Song</l>
            <l>To one that lov'd so well, and dy'd so young!</l>
            <l>So maist thou thy belov'd <hi>Alpheus</hi> please,</l>
            <l>When thou creep'st under the <hi>Sicanian</hi> Seas.</l>
            <l>Begin and sing <hi>Gallus</hi>'s, unhappy fires,</l>
            <l>Whilst yonder Goat to yonder branch aspires</l>
            <l>Out of his reach. We sing not to the deaf;</l>
            <l>An answer comes from every trembling Leaf.</l>
            <l>What Woods, what Forests had intic'd your stay,</l>
            <l>Ye <hi>Nayades,</hi> why came ye not away!</l>
            <l>When <hi>Gallus</hi> dy'd by an unworthy flame</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Parnassus</hi> knew, and lov'd too well his name</l>
            <l>To stop your course; nor could your hasty flight</l>
            <l>Be staid by <hi>Pindus</hi> which was his delight.</l>
            <l>Him the fresh Laurels, Him the lowly Heath</l>
            <l>Bewail'd with dewy tears; his parting breath</l>
            <l>Made lofty <hi>Maenalus</hi> hang his piny head;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Lycaean</hi> Marbles wept when he was dead.</l>

            <l>The fair <hi>Adonis</hi> would be proud to keep.</l>
            <l>There came the Shepherds, there the weary Hinds,</l>
            <l>Thither <hi>Menalcas</hi> parcht with Frost and Winds.</l>
            <l>All ask him whence, for whom this fatal love</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Apollo</hi> came his Arts and Herbs to prove.</l>
            <l>Why <hi>Gallus?</hi> why so fond? He says; thy flame,</l>
            <l>Thy care, <hi>Lycoris,</hi> is another's game;</l>
            <l>For him she sighs and raves, him she pursues</l>
            <l>Through mid days heats, and through the morning dews;</l>
            <l>Over the snowy cliffs and frozen streams,</l>
            <l>Through noisy Camps. Up <hi>Gallus,</hi> leave thy dreams,</l>
            <l>She has left thee. Still lay the drooping Swain</l>
            <l>Hanging his mournfull head, <hi>Phoebus</hi> in vain</l>
            <l>Offers his Herbs, employs his counsel here;</l>
            <l>'Tis all refus'd, or answer'd with a tear.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:35140:8"/>
What shakes the branches! what makes all the trees</l>
            <l>Begin to bow their heads, the Goats their knees!</l>
            <l>Oh! 'tis <hi>Sylvanus</hi> with his mossy beard</l>
            <l>And leafy crown, attended by a herd</l>
            <l>Of Wood-born Satyrs; see! he shakes his Spear,</l>
            <l>A green young Oak the tallest of the year.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Pan</hi> the <hi>Arcadian</hi> god forsook the plains,</l>
            <l>Mov'd with the story of his <hi>Gallus</hi> pains.</l>
            <l>We saw him come with Oaten pipe in hand</l>
            <l>Painted with Berries-juice; we saw him stand</l>
            <l>And gaze upon his Shepherds bathing Eyes;</l>
            <l>And what, no end, no end of grief he cries!</l>
            <l>Love, little minds all thy consuming care,</l>
            <l>Or restless thoughts, they are his daily fare.</l>
            <l>Nor cruel Love with tears, nor grass with show'rs</l>
            <l>Nor Goats with tender sprouts, nor Bees with flow'rs</l>
            <l>Are ever satisfi'd. So said the god,</l>
            <l>And toucht the Shepherd with his hazle rod:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:35140:8"/>
He, sorrow-slain, seem'd to revive, and said,</l>
            <l>But yet <hi>Arcadians</hi> is my grief allay'd,</l>
            <l>To think that in these Woods, and Hills, and Plains,</l>
            <l>When I am silent in the grave, your Swains</l>
            <l>Shall sing my loves, <hi>Arcadian</hi> Swains inspir'd</l>
            <l>By <hi>Phoebus;</hi> Oh! how gently shall these tir'd</l>
            <l>And fainting Limbs repose in endless sleep,</l>
            <l>Whilst your sweet Notes my Love immortal keep!</l>
            <l>Would it had pleas'd the Gods I had been born</l>
            <l>Just one of you, and taught to wind a Horn,</l>
            <l>Or weild a Hook, or prune a branching Vine,</l>
            <l>And known no other Love but, <hi>Phillis,</hi> thine;</l>
            <l>Or thine, <hi>Amyntas;</hi> What though both are brown,</l>
            <l>So are the Nuts and Berries on the Down;</l>
            <l>Amongst the Vines, the Willows, and the Springs,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Phillis</hi> makes Garlands, and <hi>Amyntas</hi> sings.</l>
            <l>No cruel Absence calls my Love away</l>
            <l>Farther than bleating Sheep can go astray.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:35140:9"/>
Here, my <hi>Lycoris,</hi> here are shady groves,</l>
            <l>Here Fountains cool, and Meadows soft, our lvoes</l>
            <l>And lives may here together wear and end:</l>
            <l>O the true joys of such a fate and friend!</l>
            <l>I now am hurried by severe commands</l>
            <l>Into remotest parts, among the bands</l>
            <l>Of armed Troops; there by my foes pursu'd,</l>
            <l>Here by my friends; but still by love subdu'd.</l>
            <l>Thou far from home, and me, art wandring o'er</l>
            <l>The <hi>Alpine</hi> snows, the farthest Western shore,</l>
            <l>The frozen <hi>Rhine.</hi> When are we like to meet?</l>
            <l>Ah gently, gently, lest thy tender feet</l>
            <l>Be cut with Ice. Cover thy lovely armes;</l>
            <l>The Northern cold relents not at their charms:</l>
            <l>Away I'll go into some shady bow'rs,</l>
            <l>And sing the songs I made in happy hours;</l>
            <l>And charm my woes. How can I better chuse,</l>

            <l>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:35140:9"/>
And carve our loves upon the tender Trees,</l>
            <l>There they will thrive? See how my love agrees</l>
            <l>With the young plants: look how they grow toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</l>
            <l>In spight of absence, and in spight of weather.</l>
            <l>Mean while I'll climb that Rock, and ramble o'er</l>
            <l>Yon woody Hill; I'll chase the grizly Boar,</l>
            <l>I'll find <hi>Diana</hi>'s and her Nymphs resort;</l>
            <l>No frosts, no storms shall slack my eager sport.</l>
            <l>Methinks I'm wandring all about the rocks</l>
            <l>And hollow sounding woods: look how my locks</l>
            <l>Are torn with boughs and thorns! My shafts are gone</l>
            <l>My legs are tir'd, and all my sport is done,</l>
            <l>Alas! this is no cure for my disease;</l>
            <l>Nor can our toyls that cruel god appease.</l>
            <l>Now neither Nymphs, nor Songs can please me more,</l>
            <l>Nor hollow Woods, nor yet the chafed Boar:</l>
            <l>No sport, no labour, can divert my grief:</l>
            <l>Without <hi>Lycoris</hi> there is no relief.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:35140:10"/>
Though I should drink up <hi>Heber</hi>'s icy streams,</l>
            <l>Or <hi>Scythian</hi> snows, yet still her fiery beams</l>
            <l>Would scorch me up. Whatever we can prove,</l>
            <l>Love conquers all, and we must yield to Love.</l>

            <l>Strangers to breathe thy air their own would shun;</l>
            <l>And of thy children none abroad would roam,</l>

            <l>Come and embrace us in thy saving armes,</l>

            <l>Thou art indeed the Empress of the Sea.</l>
            <l>So may thy Ships about the Ocean course,</l>

            <l>So may no storms ever infest thy shores,</l>

            <l>Kindled by winds that blow from off thy Fleets.</l>
            <l>Maist thou feel no more fits of factious rage,</l>
            <l>But all distempers may thy <hi>Charles</hi> assuage,</l>

            <l>As none but ill and hated men may hate.</l>
            <l>And maist thou from him endless Monarchs see</l>
            <l>Whom thou maist honour, who may honour thee.</l>
            <l>May they be wise and good, thy happy seat,</l>

My LADY GIFFARD's
LOORY.</head>
            <l>OF all the questions which the curious raise</l>
            <l>Either in search of knowledge or of praise,</l>
            <l>None seems so much perplexed or so nice</l>
            <l>As where to find the seat of Paradise.</l>
            <l>But who could once that happy Region name</l>
            <l>From whence the fair and charming <hi>Loory</hi> came?</l>
            <l>To end this doubt would give the best advice,</l>
            <l>For this was sure the bird of Paradise.</l>
            <l>Such radiant colours from no tainted air,</l>
            <l>Such notes and humour from no lands of care,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:35140:28"/>
Such unknown smells cou'd from no common earth,</l>
            <l>From no known Climate could receive a birth.</l>
            <l>For he alone in these alive outvi'd</l>
            <l>All the perfumes with which the Phoenix di'd.</l>
            <l>About a gentle Turtle's was the size,</l>
            <l>The sweetest shape that e'er surprized eyes.</l>
            <l>A longish hawked bill, and yellow brown,</l>
            <l>A slick black velvet cap upon the crown.</l>
            <l>His back a scarlet mantle cover'd o'er,</l>
            <l>One purple sploach upon his neck he wore.</l>
            <l>His jetty eyes were circled all with flame.</l>
            <l>His swelling Breast was, with his back, the same.</l>
            <l>All down his belly a deep violet hue</l>
            <l>Was gently shaded to an azure blue.</l>
            <l>His spreading wings were green, to brown inclin'd,</l>
            <l>But with a sweet pale straw colour were lin'd.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:35140:29"/>
His tail, above was purples mixt with green,</l>
            <l>Under, a colour such as ne'er was seen,</l>
            <l>When like a Fan it spread, a mixture bold</l>
            <l>Of green and yellow grideline and gold.</l>
            <l>Thus by fond Nature was he drest more gay</l>
            <l>Than Eastern Kings in all their rich array,</l>
            <l>For Feather much, as well as Flow'r, outvies</l>
            <l>In softness, silk, in colour mortal dies.</l>
            <l>But none his beauty with his humour dare,</l>
            <l>Nor can his Body with his Soul compare.</l>
            <l>If that was wonder, this was Prodigy,</l>
            <l>They differ'd as the finest Earth and Sky.</l>
            <l>If ever any reasonable Soul</l>
            <l>Harbor'd in shape of either brute or fowl,</l>
            <l>This was the Mansion, Metamorphosie</l>
            <l>Gain'd here the credit lost in Poetrie.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:35140:29"/>
No passion moving in a humane breast</l>
            <l>Was plainer seen, or livelier exprest.</l>
            <l>No wit or learning, eloquence or song,</l>
            <l>Acknowledg'd kindness, or complain'd of wrong</l>
            <l>With accents half so feeling as his notes:</l>
            <l>Look how he rages, now again he dotes;</l>
            <l>Brave like the Eagle, meek as is the Dove,</l>
            <l>Jealous as Men, like Women does he love.</l>
            <l>With bill he wounds you sudden as a dart,</l>
            <l>Then nibling asks you pardon from his heart.</l>
            <l>He calls you back if e'er you go away,</l>
            <l>He thanks you if you are so kind to stay.</l>
            <l>When you return, with exultation high</l>
            <l>He raises notes that almost pierce the Sky,</l>
            <l>But all in such a language that we guest,</l>
            <l>Though he spoke ours, he found his own the best.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:35140:30"/>
Such a <hi>Badeen</hi> ne'er came upon the Stage,</l>
            <l>So droll, so monkey in his play and rage;</l>
            <l>Sprawling upon his back, and pitching pyes,</l>
            <l>Twirling his head, and flurring at the flies.</l>
            <l>A thousand tricks and postures would he show,</l>
            <l>Then rise so pleas'd both with himself and you,</l>
            <l>That the amaz'd beholders could not say</l>
            <l>Whether the bird was happier, or they.</l>
            <l>With a soft brush was tipt his wanton tongue,</l>
            <l>He lapt his water like a Tyger young,</l>
            <l>His Lady's teeth with this he pickt and prun'd;</l>
            <l>With this a thousand various notes he tun'd.</l>
            <l>A chagrin fine cover'd his little feet,</l>
            <l>Which to wild airs would in wild measures meet.</l>
            <l>With these he took you by the hand, his prey</l>
            <l>With these he seiz'd, with these he hopt away.</l>
            <l>With these held up he made his bold defence,</l>
            <l>The arms of safety, love and violence.</l>
            <l>

With all these charms <hi>Loory</hi> endow'd and drest,</l>

            <l>Fed with her hands, and percht upon her head,</l>

            <l>Nurst with her cares, preserved with her fears,</l>

            <l>Trouble in absence, by return relief.</l>

               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aristaeus</hi> was Son of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> Daughter to
one of the ancient Kings of <hi>Arcadia;</hi>
and by <hi>Apollo</hi> as was believed or at least
reported. His Birth was concealed, and
he was sent to be privately brought up
among the Shepherds of <hi>Arcadia;</hi> where
grown a Man, he applyed himself wholly
to the cares and stores of a Country Life,
in all which he succeeded, so as to grow
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:35140:33"/>
nowned for his Knowledge and Wealth.
He was esteemed the first Inventer of
Cheese, Oyl and Honey, or rather of
the Art of hiving Bees, which before
were wild, and their Stocks found only
by chance and in hollow Trees. For this
he was worshipt among the <hi>Arcadians</hi> as
Son of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and as other Inventers
of things necessary or most useful to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Life. He fell in love with <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridice</hi>
newly espoused to <hi>Orpheus;</hi> and
by his pursuit of her, was the occasion of
her Death, being bitten by a Snake as she
fled from him. This was followed by the
death of <hi>Orpheus</hi> after a long and incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
grief, whereupon <hi>Aristaeus</hi> was by
the Nymphs Companions of <hi>Euridice,</hi>
plagued in all his Stores, but most of all
in his Bees, of which he was fondest,
till he lost them all, and was in despair
ever to recover them: But by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of his Mother and of <hi>Proteus,</hi> to
whom she sent him, he came to find out
both the true cause of his loss, and means
of retrieving it.</p>
