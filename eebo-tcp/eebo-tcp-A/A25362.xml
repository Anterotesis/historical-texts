            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>BY the enſuing relation, it will appear that
<hi>France</hi> which was not until of late, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
amongſt the Nations, that were conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
for their Maritime ſtrength, was at laſt become
not leſs formidable at Sea than Land; and how great
it has been on the Continent is too well known by the
Mighty acquiſitions that Crown has made in one Age,
that <hi>France</hi> it ſelf is almoſt loſt in the midſt of that
vaſt Empire which it is now become, by moſt unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wreſting from all the Neighbouring Princes; But
the full Force was never known untill theſe laſt three
Years, in which it has made head againſt almoſt all
the Chriſtian World, and for the moſt part, rather
gained than loſt of thoſe Princes, and States in War
with her: From whence it is Obvious in what conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the reſt of <hi>Europe</hi> had been in, but for the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
oppoſition <hi>England</hi> has made, being influenced
by their Heroick King, which ſufficiently ſhews the
<pb facs="tcp:50977:3"/>
Neceſſity there was for the late Revolution. For from
that time may <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth date the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of his Project, and the reſt of <hi>Europe</hi> their
Enlargement from the Slavery he deſigned, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for them, for whatever turns like Fortune he
may have, they will rather ſeem, than really be the
effects of Strength, for nothing is plainer than that
<hi>France</hi> has been at the Zenith of its Greatneſs, and
now in the Declenſion may ſtrugle ſometimes, and do
ſome miſchief, but never recover power enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
the Structure he was forming. The Victory their
Majesties Fleet has obtained, having ſo ſhooke that
Monarchy, that not their Alpes, nor Barrier in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
can ſecure <hi>France</hi> from being pierced to the
Heart. Another way being now opend which a few
months will plainly demonſtrate, and which perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
I ſhall rather chooſe to write after, than the
Predictions now. I ſhall therefore proceed to relate ſome
particulars of this great Conqueſt, which is like yet
to be much greater in the Conſequence.</p>

            <head>AN
ACCOUNT
Of the LATE
ENGAGEMENT, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Power of <hi>France</hi> was ſo much encreas'd in
Shipping under the Reign of their Preſent
King, that it has not been an Imaginary hopes
which the <hi>French,</hi> and their Friends in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
Conceiv'd, that they might make themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
at Sea, eſpecially after they had in the Year Ninety,
made ſome Experiment of their Strength, which, if
they had been able to Effect this Preſent Year, they had
provided themſelves of Forces, Artillery, and Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
upon the Coaſts of <hi>Normandy,</hi> to have Embarkt on
Tranſport Ships for that Purpoſe, to have made a deſcent
on <hi>England,</hi> under pretence of reſtoring the Late King
<hi>James.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> promis'd themſelves ſuch aſſur'd Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
in this Deſign, that they acted with an unuſual Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
openly declaring their Intentions, (it being well
known, that whatever advantages they have obtain'd
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50977:4"/>
for the time paſt; Treachery, or Secrecy, at leaſt were the
means whereby they Compaſſed them) and that their Actions
might accompany their great Words, with indefatigable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
they work'd on their Fleet at <hi>Breſt,</hi> and on the 12th. of
<hi>May</hi> (their Stile) the Count <hi>de Tourville</hi> ſet Sail out of the
Road of <hi>Bertaume,</hi> for the Coaſts of <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>French</hi>
Endeavours were not Confined only to their Port of <hi>Breſt;</hi>
but at <hi>Thoulon</hi> alſo they had equipt 16 large Ships to bring
round out of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> to joyn the reſt, but the
difficulties they met with had prevented their haſte, and
they had not Patience to expect their Coming, but put
to Sea with what Strength they had, their Party in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
having given them repeated Aſſurances, that the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Preparations were very backward, having as yet
but few Ships at Sea, and thoſe ſmall, and weakly Mann'd,
that the Capital Men of War would not get out until the
end of <hi>May</hi> at the ſooneſt, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Squadron were not
yet joyn'd, nor ready, and that it was poſſible to get
between what were already out, and the other, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their ever coming together, and by theſe means de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
both.</p>
            <p>But as an Earneſt of their other Succeſſes, they had
News that the Count <hi>d' Eſtree</hi> with the <hi>Thoulon</hi> Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,
which at firſt conſiſted of 16 great Men of War,
6 Fireſhips, and 3 Galliots, had on the 18th. of <hi>April,</hi>
as he was about to paſs the Streights, fallen into a Storm
wherein 2 of his Ships, one of 64, the other of 70 Guns,
run aſhore on the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary</hi> near <hi>Ceuta,</hi> where 250
Men were drown'd, and about 500 more made Priſoners
by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> beſides theſe loſt, ſeveral others were
ſeparated.</p>
            <p>

<hi>Tourville</hi> on the 10 of <hi>May</hi> appear'd near <hi>Dartmouth,</hi>
with about 100 Sail of all Sorts, but the Wind being
Eaſterly in the Evening, he ſtood off towards their own
Coaſts; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet which was then out, under
the Command of Sir <hi>Ralph Delaval,</hi> and Rear-Admiral
<hi>Carter,</hi> was about St. <hi>Hellen</hi>'s; on the 12th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
<hi>Callenburge,</hi> and Rear Admiral <hi>Evertzen,</hi> with 9 or
10 great <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships paſs'd by <hi>Deal,</hi> and ſailed Weſtward,
and on the 13th. the Wind ſtill Favouring, another <hi>Dutch</hi>
Man of War ſailed after them, and on <hi>Thurſday,</hi> the 12th.
in the Afternoon, Admiral <hi>Ruſſel</hi> weigh'd out of <hi>Rye-Bay,</hi>
and about 11 a Clock on <hi>Friday</hi> Morning joyn'd the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
and <hi>Dutch,</hi> at which time the whole Fleet conſiſted of
about 90 Sail for the Line of Battle; on the ſame Day
Admiral <hi>Ruſſel</hi> acquainted the Officers that he had receiv'd
a Letter from the Earl of <hi>Nottingham</hi> by Her Majeſty's
Command, wherein he ſignified that Her Majeſty had
been inform'd, that a Scandalous Report had been ſpread
abroad, as if ſome of the Officers of the Fleet were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
to their Majeſty's Service, and that her Majeſty
had order'd the Diſcharge of ſeveral of them, but that
Her Majeſty was aſſured this Diſcourſe was raiſed Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
by the Enemies of the Government, and that Her
Majeſty was ſo well pleaſed, and ſatisfied with their Zeal
and Service to their Majeſties, and the Defence of their
Country, that ſhe had reſolved not to diſplace any one
of them. As ſoon as this was made known to them by
the Admiral, they made and ſent up an Addreſs, which was
the next Day preſented to the Queen by the Lord's
Commiſſioners of the Admiralty. And was in theſe
following Words.</p>

This Addreſs was Signed by Sir <hi>John Aſhby,</hi> Admiral
of the Blew, Sir <hi>Ralph Delaval,</hi> Vice-Admiral of the Red,
Mr. <hi>Rooke,</hi> Vice-Admiral of the Blew, Sir <hi>Clouſley Shovel</hi>
Rear-Admiral of the Red, Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> Rear Admiral of the
Blue, and the other Commanders of Their Majeſties Fleet,
and Her Majeſty received it very Graciouſly, being plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to ſay,</p>
            <p>That She always had this Opinion of the Commanders; but
was very glad this was come to ſatisfie others.</p>
            <p>The day before this Addreſs was formed, the <hi>French</hi>
Fleet was ſeen off of the <hi>Start point</hi> near <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> and
her Majeſty was aſſured that the <hi>Rochfort</hi> Squadron under
the Command of the Sieur <hi>De Vilette,</hi> had joined. the Count
<hi>de Tourville;</hi> but that the <hi>Thoulon</hi> Squadron was not as
yet arrived at <hi>Breſt.</hi> And Admiral <hi>Ruſſel</hi> on the <hi>17th.</hi>
Sailed with the whole Fleet <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> to the
<hi>Weſtward,</hi> having a fair Wind; and here it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that from the time the <hi>French</hi> put to Sea until
this time, the Wind proved <hi>Eaſterly,</hi> or to the <hi>North;</hi>
and that there had not been ſix hours of <hi>Southerly,</hi> or
<hi>Weſterly</hi> Winds which are ſo frequent, more eſpecially at
this time of the Year: Or elſe in all probability that
part of the Fleet which was firſt at Sea, was in danger
to have fallen under the power of the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> King had moſt certainly given poſitive
Orders to his Admiral to attack the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>
Fleet, when, and where ever he met them; his Reaſons
for ſo peremptory a Command, conſidering how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<hi>France</hi> has managed it ſelf during the whole War,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50977:6"/>
both at Sea and Land, has occaſioned the moſt curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
obſervers to enquire very carefully into the Cauſe,
and has produced very different Opinions concerning the
ſame; with ſome of which I ſhall acquaint you (<hi>viz.</hi>)
That the War bore ſo very hard upon him that he
lay under a neceſſity to make uſe of his utmoſt Efforts
to end it; which a great Victory at Sea would have
Contributed much to, and that if he was defeated
the loſs could be ſcarce heavier to him, than the vaſt
Charge of maintaining ſuch a Fleet at that extream Ebb
the War has reduced him to: But this being a Notion
taken up by Men of too fine Speculation, I ſhall wave
repeating any more of it; but proceed to ſome other
more believed, and more probable Reaſons; which are,
that Monſieur <hi>Pontchartain,</hi> his intendant General for
Maritime Affairs, or his Agents, had recourſe to the old
<hi>French</hi> method of Bribery. And had made ſuch offers
of Money to ſome that had Command in the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Fleet, that they making it known had leave to accept the
Money, and were only exhorted to perform their duty to
Their Majeſties, and their Country, or whether the <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite</hi>
party in <hi>England,</hi> after having told ſo many lyes of
their own ſtrength, and the general Inclination of the
People to return to their former Slavery, had alſo brought
themſelves to believe; that the Officers of the Fleet would
revolt, and had impoſed the ſame upon the <hi>French</hi> King
for Truth, or whether they had aſſured him their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or Cowardice was ſuch, that they were eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come;
one of theſe it's generally believed haſtned the
<hi>French</hi> to Sea, and upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſt, and which<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
it was, tho' no thanks are due to ſuch as would
betray their Country, yet more advantages have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50977:6"/>
by this Advice and Intelligence, to this Nation
than ever ſo inconſiderable a party for Sence, Fortunes, or
Courage, could have contributed with all their beſt Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Services, which makes it evident that there is
nothing ſo bad, that at ſometimes is not good for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>For now on the <hi>19th.</hi> Their Majeſties Fleet about ſix
Leagues from <hi>Cape Barfleur,</hi> got ſight of the <hi>French,</hi>
who came down with Wind at <hi>S. W.</hi> upon the <hi>Engliſh;</hi>

            <p>This Letter was ſent from the Admiral by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of the <hi>Mary Galley</hi> to <hi>Portsmouth;</hi> who brought
a further account (<hi>viz.</hi>) That at Eight a Clock on <hi>Friday</hi>
Morning, being the <hi>20th.</hi> of <hi>May;</hi> he left the Fleet at
<hi>S.</hi> and by <hi>W.</hi> about Fifteen Leagues diſtance off of
the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> that he ſaw the Seconds of two of
the <hi>French</hi> Admirals ſink, and many Ships on Fire;
that the Sea was full of Wrecks of Ships for two Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
together; but that he knew not, that any of Their
Majeſties Ships were loſt: That the <hi>French</hi> run, and ours
purſued them; and on the one twentieth we heard from
<hi>Portsmouth,</hi> that Their Majeſties Ship the <hi>Montague</hi>
came in diſabled, and Captain <hi>Foulk</hi> the Commander
confirmed the News of the <hi>French</hi> being beaten; that
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were in purſuit of them at Nine in the
Morning the day before; which was the time he left the
Fleet: and further ſaid that Admiral <hi>Carter</hi> was Killed,
who was Rear Admiral of the Blue, his Death was the
only allay to all this good News, being generally la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
both at Sea and Land; he was a very brave
Officer, and Faithful to Their Majeſties Service; and his
Memory will Live and ſerve for an Example to Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
others, for the Honour he had obtained was for his
Gallantry, having riſen from a much lower Capacity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:50977:7"/>
Captain <hi>Killingworth</hi> Commander of the the <hi>Fox</hi> Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
came alſo to <hi>Portſmouth</hi> in his Boat, and Confirmed
the foregoing Account, and further added, that he had
burnt his Fireſhip on Board a <hi>French</hi> Rear-Admiral, but
was put off with great Difficulty, that he ſaw a <hi>French</hi>
Man of War of about 70 Guns blow up, and another 3
Deck'd Ship on Fire.</p>
            <p>Thus every day produced ſeveral freſh Advices of the
happy ſucceſs of their Majeſty's Arms, and more were
expected, for Victory was not doubted from ſuch a Fleet,
ſo Commanded; for Admiral Ruſſel before the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
went on Board all the Men of War, to animate both
Officers and Sea-men, aſſuring them he had no diſtruſt
that they wanted Courage or Loyalty, and for his own
Part, if he failed in his Duty, he deſired that they would
not ſpare to throw him Over-board, and as he propoſed
himſelf the Pattern they ſhould follow, ſo if any ſuch were
found that neglected to imitate him, they ſhould be made
ſevere Examples. Although this might be of excellent uſe,
yet all the Commanders left us without Knowledge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it would have been wanting, every one ſtriving to
excel.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> the 21ſt. of <hi>May,</hi> the Queen receiv'd by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,
that by the former days Action the <hi>French</hi> Fleet was
ſo diminiſhed, that their Number was reduced to Thirty
Six, which were ſeen to the Leeward of us, at about
two Leagues Diſtance, the Wind at <hi>E. N. E.</hi> the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Fleet endeavouring to get up with them, and they
retiring, and on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 21. the Wind ſerving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
both for Eaſtward and Weſtward, the Enemy
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50977:8"/>
divided: about 9 that Morning, Admiral <hi>Ruſſel</hi> took his
Courſe towards <hi>Barfleur,</hi> having got ſight of ſeveral <hi>French</hi>
Ships under the Shoar, and Admiral <hi>Allemonde</hi> with the
Admiral of the <hi>Blue,</hi> ſailed to the Weſtward. The <hi>Dutch</hi>
Admiral Diſcovered Sixteen <hi>French</hi> Ships, which he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
were coming from <hi>France</hi> to joyn their Fleet, and
endeavoured to get up with them; in the mean time
Sir <hi>John Aſhby</hi> purſued the reſt of their Fleet, who ſtrove
in great Confuſion to get into the <hi>Race</hi> of <hi>Orney.</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
<hi>Allemonde</hi> loſt Sight of them he purſued in the
Night, and believing they had got in amongſt the Rocks
thought it not adviſeable to follow them, and ſo ſailed
Eaſtward again to join Admiral <hi>Ruſſel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 22d. in the Forenoon, Sir <hi>Ralph Delaval</hi> Burnt
under <hi>Cape de Wyke</hi> near the Shoar, the <hi>Royal Sun,</hi> being
the Ship of the Count <hi>de Tourville</hi> Admiral of the <hi>French</hi>
Fleet, ſhe carry'd 104 Guns; the Admirable comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by Monſieur <hi>Beaujeau</hi> his Second, that carryed 102
Guns, and the Conquerant of Eighty Guns, with two
Friggats, and three Veſſels of leſſer Rank; at this time
alſo Admiral <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was in cloſe purſuit of another part
of them. The Priſoners of the Ships that Sir <hi>Ralph De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laval</hi>
Burnt, Declar'd, that during the Engagement 4 or 5
of their biggeſt Ships were deſtroy'd.</p>
            <p>Colonel <hi>Anthony Haſtings</hi> who Commanded the <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi>
was kill'd in the Fight, and his Ship diſabled, which
was afterwards brought into <hi>Portſmouth</hi> to refit: Captain
<hi>Grayden</hi> that Commanded the <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> was Woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and his Ship, with the Seven Provinces, one of the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Squadron, and one or two more being diſabled were
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50977:8"/>
brought into <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> but not one Ship <hi>Engliſh</hi> nor
<hi>Dutch</hi> was miſſing. Her Majeſty commanded that Care
ſhould be taken that able Chirurgeons ſhould be ſent
down to look after the Sick and Wound<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d Seamen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
were brought into <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> belonging to the ſaid Ships,
or any other, and that the Hoſpitals in <hi>Southwark</hi> and
<hi>Smithfield</hi> might be fitted up to receive them.</p>
            <p>Four <hi>French</hi> Ships of Three Decks lay on the back of
the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Weight</hi> very much diſabled, and two <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Men of War that were refitted, with two <hi>Dutch</hi> Friggats
and a Fire-ſhip, were ordered to go out, and take or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
them.</p>
            <p>This Extraordinary Victory which coſt ſo little on our
ſide, and ſo much exceeded the expectation of all People,
was received by Her Majeſty with a great deal of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
plainly ſhewing that She had no other Joy in it
than the ſafety of Her People, and the Intereſt the reſt of
Chriſtendom had in their Majeſty's Succeſſes. But the
People ſo univerſally diſcovered their Pleaſure in having
beaten the <hi>French,</hi> who had ſo ſhamefully ſcandaliz'd the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation two Years before, that they knew not
ſufficiently how to expreſs themſelves; no other Buſineſs
was much talkt off, but Praiſes and Encomiums on the
Conduct and Courage of the Admiral, and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
and for ſeveral Days and Nights, Ringing of
Bells and Bonefires, yet ſuch was the Care of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that not a Perſon nor a Houſe was Damnified by
the common People of thoſe who were known to wiſh
well to the Enemies of this Kingdom, and were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
ſuſpected to have gone further than Wiſhes, to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50977:9"/>
Contribute towards enſlaving us, and all poſterity to the
<hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 25th. in the Evening came Captain
<hi>Mees,</hi> Commander of the <hi>Ruby,</hi> a Fourth Rate, with
Letters from Sir <hi>Ralph Delaval</hi> to my Lord <hi>Nottingham,</hi>
bearing Date the 22d. giving a particular Account of his
Burning the Three Ships before mentioned (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Sun,</hi> and his two Seconds, the <hi>Conquerant</hi> and the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable.</hi>
The moſt material Paſſages were, that after <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
Ruſſel</hi> had given the Signal for the Ships to cut their
Cables, Sir <hi>Ralph Delaval</hi> found that the <hi>French</hi> had quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the <hi>Race</hi> of <hi>Orney,</hi> and that ſome of them ſtood for the
<hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Cherbourg;</hi> he followed them, and ſaw three 3
deck'd Ships, but ſo cloſe to the Shoar, that it was unſafe
to follow them further, untill he had inform'd himſelf of
the Road, they being within ſhoal Water, and ſounding
within Gun-ſhot, they ſtrove to hinder it by continual
Firings; ſo to prevent loſs of time, Sir <hi>Ralph Delaval</hi> went
on Board the St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and hoiſted his Flag, ordering
the <hi>Ruby</hi> and two Fireſhips to attend him, with which
he ſtood in, leaving the great Ships without, but coming
near, the <hi>French</hi> gauled him ſo extreamly, and finding the
Fire-ſhips could not get in, he retreated out of ſhot, and
Anchored, and called a Council of War, where it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to attempt them in the Morningwith all the Third
and Fourth Rates, and Fireſhips, but finding that would
not doe the Buſineſs, the Water being ſhoal, Sir <hi>Ralph
Delaval</hi> order'd Three Fire-ſhips to attempt the burning of
them, going himſelf with Barges, and Tenders to take
them up, if the Enemies ſhot hinder'd the Deſign. The
Service was ſharp, the Enemy firing both from their Ships
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50977:9"/>
and Fort, yet the Bravery of the Officers and Men, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame
the difficulty, ſo that two of the Fire-ſhips did
Execution, burning two of them, the other Fire-ſhip by
a Random ſhot was ſet on Fire, being ready to Board
the Enemy. The Action was brave beyond Expreſſion, and
was earneſtly recommended to Her Majeſty by Admiral
<hi>Delaval,</hi> who obſerving the People goe out of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
<hi>French</hi> Ship by Boatfulls, he commanded the St.
<hi>Albans</hi> and the <hi>Reſerve,</hi> with others to fire at her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
it would make them quit her, and after ſome time
finding no reſiſtance, took all the Boats armed, and went
on Board where were a great Number of Men, but no
Officers, he took them all out maimed and whole, and ſet
her on Fire. Sir <hi>Ralph Delaval</hi> had ſet all the <hi>French</hi> on
ſhoar, but that he was told thirty ſail of Ships were ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with him, which afterwards prov'd to be Sir <hi>John
Aſhby</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> coming from the Weſtward, by
which means all the Priſoners remained on Board, and were
very uneaſie to him; from hence they ſailed Eaſtwards
towards the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>la Hogue,</hi> where it was expected to
find 3 or 4 more <hi>French</hi> Ships.</p>
            <p>This Action was of very great Conſequence, and as
great danger but the Admiral, Sir <hi>Ralph Delaval,</hi> well
knew the bravery, and Loyalty of them he Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
would ſurmount all difficulties: The Captains of
the Fireſhips Names were, Captain <hi>Heath,</hi> who burnt
the <hi>Royal Sun,</hi> which was the greateſt Action of all:
For that Ship, being the Admiral, made a ſtout Reſiſtance.
Captain <hi>Greenway,</hi> burnt the <hi>Conquerant,</hi> which was
alſo a brave Enterpriſe: The <hi>Admirable,</hi> was burnt
by the Boats, after Captain <hi>Fowlis</hi> his Fireſhip was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50977:10"/>
by the Enemies Shot; which if he had eſcaped
there was no fear of his performing his Orders.</p>
            <p>A Captain of a <hi>French</hi> Fireſhip being taken declared,
that during the firſt Engagement on the Nineteenth
day, Monſieur <hi>Gabaret</hi> Admiral of their Blue, loſt his
Ship which carried Ninety Guns, and that four others
were burnt, or ſunk at the ſame time, and at the time
when the three afore mentioned Ships were burnt, in the
Bay of <hi>Cherbourg,</hi> four ſmaller were deſtroyed, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
three hundred of their Men periſhed; what the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> could ſave were made Priſoners, and ſome others
were not hindred going on Shore.</p>
            <p>Whileſt this Gallant Action was Effecting, Admiral
<hi>Ruſſel</hi> lay with the remainder of the Fleet before <hi>La
Hogue,</hi> having cloſely ſhut up all that were left of the
<hi>French</hi> biggeſt Ships; there being Ten three Decks each,
beſides others. But about Twenty of their ſmaller Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
got away through the <hi>Race</hi> of <hi>Orney,</hi> and made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their own Harbours: It was impoſſible for the
reſt to eſcape the Vigilance of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Admiral;
who had now almoſt finiſhed his Propoſals, in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he ſent to My Lord <hi>Nottingham,</hi> in which he ſays that
if it pleaſed God to ſpare him a little clear weather, he
doubted not to deſtroy their whole Fleet. And that ſuch
weather he had appears by the ſucceſs; and through the
whole time it is very Remarkable, that an eſpecial Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
attended their Majeſties juſt undertaking; for from
the day the <hi>French</hi> Fleet put firſt to Sea, the Wind was
for the moſt part full againſt them, or ſo contrary, that
they could never get up to Admiral <hi>Delaval,</hi> and <hi>Carter,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:50977:10"/>
when they had the only time to perform any thing, and
as ſoon as Admiral<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Ruſſel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> were joined, a
Wind ſerved fair which brought them to their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and hindred their Return.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thursday</hi> the <hi>26th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> came an Account by Letter from
Admiral <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> bearing Date the <hi>24th</hi> of the laſt and
greateſt Deſtruction of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, which I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
lay in the <hi>Bay La Hogue:</hi> That on the day before
he ſent Admiral <hi>Rooke,</hi> with a Squadron of Ships, and Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
and all the Boats in the Fleet, to burn Thirteen
Ships that lay there: And notwithſtanding the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Firing the <hi>French</hi> made from their Ships, and Platforms
(it being at their own Shore) it ſucceeded ſo that ſix
three Deck Ships were burnt that Night, but then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
dark, and thick weather, the remainder were let
alone until the next Morning, at which time the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
was renewed; the Enemy were beaten from ſeveral
of their own Ships, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Seamen took poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them, and turned their own Guns upon them, with
which they beat them from their Platforms. This Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
cauſed a great ſlaughter of the <hi>French,</hi> for one Ship of
Fifty ſix Guns was overſet and utterly loſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the reſt were
all burnt: and now there was not known to be one more
of that Fleet at Sea, from which the <hi>French</hi> King and his
favourers in <hi>England</hi> derived ſuch hopes, and had coſt
him ſo much labour and Treaſure to get together. That
that which had been the Work of an Age to Compleat
with all the Aſſiſtance <hi>England</hi> had in ſome foregoing
Reigns been able to afford him, was in leſs than one
Weeks time ſo Shattered, that it's now impoſſible <hi>France</hi>
ſhould ever make any Conſiderable Figure on that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50977:11"/>
either in War, or Trade, ſo that the Hands that
raiſed them, have pull'd them down. And their own
Dear Friends the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> who have ſo magnified the
ſtrength of that now Vincible Monarch, and ſo Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that of their Native Country, from which they have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
under the Government of Princes (to whom they would
render themſelves Obnoxious) received greater Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
and Advantages than the <hi>French</hi> King's Favourites
in <hi>France.</hi> Theſe alſo have Contributed their ſhares
by deceiving themſelves firſt, and next their Maſter,
for whom they gathered Intelligence; by which means
the <hi>French</hi> Fleet was Truſted at Sea, and have given an
opportunity to that Admiral and other Commanders
(which can never be ſufficiently commended) to obtain
a Victory, the greateſt that ever was upon the Ocean,
and as great in its Conſequences. For at the loweſt
Computation, there have been burnt, and ſunk no leſs
than Twenty Eight, or Thirty (the greateſt part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
of the biggeſt Ships not only that the <hi>French</hi> had,
but that were in the World, and more than ſeven
Years Peace, and all the Hands, and Treaſure he can
imploy can build over again, and ſet forth: But of
that he will find his account ſhort, being not in view
of a proſpect of Peace, nor may it be expected that
<hi>England</hi> will fall into ſuch another Lethargy, as to
ſuffer themſelves to be Rivalled in a Fleet, that had
nothing that rendred them inferiour to us, but the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
of our Officers, and Seamen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:50977:11"/>
To the End it may be known what ſtrength the <hi>French
Fleet</hi> was compoſed of (without the <hi>Thoulon</hi> Squadron) I
ſhall inſert the moſt exact Account that could be obtained
thereof (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
            <p>Eighteen Ships, from upward of Eighty Guns to One
hundred and ſix, and Thirty ſix from upwards of Sixty
Guns to Eighty, Twelve Ships from Fifty Guns to Sixty,
and Seven from thirty to Forty ſix, beſides Twenty four
Fire-ſhips, Twenty ſix Frigats, Twenty ſix Pinks, Fourteen
Long-boats: The whole of the Men of War being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to be Seventy three, which were to have on board
Forty thouſand, Two hundred, Ninety nine Men, and Five
thouſand and Nineteen Guns: Beſides theſe, Officers and
Volunteers. And in the Fire-ſhips, One hundred, Sixty
Guns, and Two hundred and Forty in the Long-boats.</p>
            <p>By the foregoing relation it will be found, that whatever
part of this Fleet was out; yet the great Ships are very
near every one deſtroyed, and the ſmaller ſo diſabled, that
ſome will never be repaired; and ſuch that can, will be a
work of Time, and when that is done will be very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable;
for 'tis eaſie to determine the ſtrength of ſuch a
Fleet, whenas they had that vaſt Addition, and were not
able to diſpute with the Force and Bravery of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
and <hi>Dutch.</hi> Beſides, all the loſs of the Seamen is irrepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the huge number of them that have been cut off by the
ſeveral ways of burning, drowning and killing in the time
of the Battel, may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to be more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
than remains in Service in the Trade of <hi>France;</hi> and
though thoſe may be poſſibly ſpared for their King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
(for I queſtion not but their Trade is near at an end,
their victorious Neighbours will carefully attend the Increaſe
of more Seamen by that means) it is plain that the Power
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50977:12"/>
of <hi>France</hi> is in its declenſion at Sea, which is the place
<hi>England</hi> had moſt reaſon to fear it; and as 'tis not probable
they can ever recover their ſtrength; ſo 'tis poſſible
and that by a reaſonable Conjecture, that in a few
Months to come, the <hi>French</hi> King will be Maſter of as
few Ships as he found at his coming to the Crown.</p>
            <p>For ſince the coming away of the News of this laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of their Men of War, we have received advice
of burning more than twenty of their Tranſport-Ships,
which lay in the Bay of <hi>La Hogue,</hi> and which the Priſoners
declare were deſigned for embarking of Men for the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Invaſion of <hi>England,</hi> the Admiral found ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
in the Execution of this Deſign, from two ſmall
forts that were on the Shore, and their ſmall Shot, which
the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> being drawn down from their Camp,
made upon our Seamen. But the former Succeſſes, and
the Chearfulneſs they undertook this Enterprize with,
made all reſiſtance ineffectual, ſo that the Admiral's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
were as punctually performed, as they were readily
obeyed; for not one Ship that lay in all that Bay eſcaped.
The Admiral after this, commanded the Admiral of the
<hi>Blue</hi> Squadron to ſail towards <hi>Havre de Grace</hi> (and if it
was practicable) to ſerve the reſt of the Tranſport-Ships
that were in that Harbour in the ſame manner, whilſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
with the reſt of the Fleet, ſailed towards the Coaſt of
<hi>England;</hi> and where on the 26th. he arrived at <hi>Spithead,</hi>
and commanded that the 27th. ſhould be obſerved with
Publick Prayers and Thankſgivings throughout the Fleet,
for the Victory obtained over Their Majeſties Enemies.</p>
            <p>On the 30th. of <hi>May</hi> it was credibly reported, that a
Perſon of great Quality received a Letter from <hi>Plymouth,</hi>
or ſome place near adjoining, that of the four great <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:50977:12"/>
Ships, formerly mentioned to be diſabled, and ſeen off the
Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> three were taken by thoſe refitted at <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
and one ſunk. Thus nothing but further Additions
to the Victory come from all Parts, and the Reports of
the <hi>French</hi> Priſoners confirm their loſs greater than we
knew, and ſome material Paſſages, which we had no other
way to be informed of, but from themſelves; one of which
I ſhall in this place recite, which is, that the <hi>French</hi>
Admiral of the <hi>Blue</hi> Squadron, which was ſet on Fire the
firſt night of the Engagement, had Mr. <hi>Fitz James</hi> on
board, that is Brother to the Duke of <hi>Berwick;</hi> but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he periſhed in the Flames, or ſaved himſelf by chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
his Ship, is not yet certainly known.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch,</hi> both Officers and Seamen, ſhowed great
forwardneſs as often as it was their Turn to have the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to engage: But they who had ſo melancholy a ſhare
two years before when they were over-powered by the
Enemies ſuperior Force, were now made amends by the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> who happened to have the greateſt part of this
Action upon their own hands, and ſo gallantly behaved
themſelves, that they never gave an Opportunity to them
to ſignalize themſelves when they had the <hi>French</hi> firſt to
engage (as it appears for the moſt part the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had
the Chance of that.) The firſt Five hours on the 19th. day,
the <hi>French</hi> are owned by all that have hitherto given any
Account of the Fight, to have purſued the Attack they
ſo briskly begun, with more Reſolution and Bravery than
ever that Nation were known to fight at Sea before; and
had they had any other than ſuch Enemies to deal
with, might with great Reaſon have expected the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
But the two extreme parts of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, that
compoſed the Line of Battle, not being able to come up
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50977:13"/>
with the <hi>French</hi> to aſſiſt thoſe of their own part, yet knew
how to make the beſt Improvement of the Time, which
they did; for whilſt Admiral <hi>Ruſſel</hi> engaged the <hi>French</hi>
Admiral and another or two, ſingly by himſelf, part of the
<hi>Blue</hi> Squadron got the Weather-gage, which the <hi>French</hi>
had before from the beginning of the Fight. And as this
very much animated the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> ſo it diſpirited
the Enemy; they ſoon after towing off Weſt-ward. And
thus happily concluding what may materially be expected
at Sea both for this Year, and others to come, I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
you with a Copy of a Letter from an Officer
in the Fleet to his Friend in <hi>London;</hi> which is in theſe
Words.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

UPON the opening of the Day in the Nineteenth in the
Morning, we were Alarm'd by our Scouts from the
Windward of the approach of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
us both to draw into a Line of Battle, with the Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
Tacks on board, the <hi>Dutch</hi> leading the Van. The
White Squadron of the <hi>French</hi> commanded by <hi>Tourville,</hi>
bore down with all imaginable Gallantry on Mr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> our
Admiral, and the Red; the White and Blue, commanded
by <hi>Amfrevile</hi> on the <hi>Dutch,</hi> though at ſo great diſtance
there was little done on either ſide; and <hi>Gabaret</hi> with the
<hi>French</hi> Blue Squadron kept ſo far a-Head, that the laſt
Twenty Ships of ours a-Stern, had hardly any Body to Fire
at, but what was at a great diſtance; the Rear-Admiral of
the Blue, who was next the Red, had ſomething to do, but
not much; and the Vice-Admiral of the Enemies Blue, who
ought to have engaged the ſame Diviſion on our ſide, took
Heart-a-grace, and with his whole Diviſion run quite away
from the Fleet, without Firing a Gun the whole Day; ſo that
the whole Battle fell on the Red on our ſide, attacked by the
<hi>French</hi> White, and aſſisted by the Rear-Admiral of their
Blue: For ſome time of the Day Sir <hi>Cloudſley Shovel</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
them of the Blue: It was very hotly diſputed doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
on both ſides, being within Muſquet Shot, pelting ſuch
vaſt Quantities of great Shot; but the advantage in leſs
than two Hours appeared on our ſide, by the <hi>Britannia</hi>'s ſo
handling the <hi>Royal Sun,</hi> that ſhe lay by an Hour without
hardly Firing a Shot. The whole Day there was but a little
Gale of Wind, and hindred our Blew Squadron from getting
in nearer to Windward of the Enemy; and to add to this
Misfortune the whole Day was attended with ſuch a Fog,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50977:14"/>
that after the first two Hours of the Fight, one could ſcarce
ſee the next Ship's Head. Just in the cloſe of the Evening
the <hi>French</hi> White, taking the occaſion of the Fogg, and the
Flood Tide, and a little Wind, let go their Anchors to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate
their retreat, and our Blue in the thick Fogg drove
through them, which cauſed hot Firing on both ſides, which
was at Night ſtopt by the Fogg, the Darkneſs being ſuch
that we could not ſee a Ship's length a-Head; and ſo ended
this Day with all Honour to the Red, who were engaged
very hard, and bravely beat all their Oppoſers; and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
<hi>Ruſſel</hi> hath all Honour imaginable due to him, First,
in commanding in Chief on ſo Happy a Day; next having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
the whole Battle with his Squadron; but in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
chiefly having Hand to Hand ſilenced the best Ship of
the Enemies in leſs than two Hours time, ſo as to be Fired
at without making a Shot. This Gentleman, Monſieur <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
was handled juſt as he did two years ago the Crippled
Dutch. And thus you may ſee what influence inequality of
Number has on the beſt of Men; for Monſieur <hi>Tourville,</hi>
(brave Enemy) could not move <hi>Amfreville</hi> in the Van hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to come within a long random Shot, nor Vice-Admiral
<hi>Panetir</hi> in the Blue to ſtrike a ſtroke; and indeed Admiral
<hi>Gabaret</hi> ſo far kept his diſtance that little could be done by
him; yet theſe three Men have particular Characters in
<hi>France</hi> for Fighting Men, the two latter, being Soldiers
of Fortune, raiſed <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

any other ſtead than to frighten their Fighting Ships, which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50977:14"/>
gave us a Victory with ſaving of much Blood, and with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of their Ships, which has ſince happened.</p>
                  <p>And ſo, Sir, I have given you the Proceedings of a Happy
Day to our Country; but unhappy to my ſelf, who had no ſhare
in this Honour, my Post being the very laſt of the Fleet, on
that Tack of the last Twenty Ships of ours, with which the
Vice-Admiral of the <hi>French</hi> Blue run away, and the
reſt wearily kept the Wind, ſo that we had not one Ship
to Fire at. The little Wind and very Foggy Weather hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
us from getting up to our Friends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Next to our Admiral, Sir</hi> Ralph Delaval, <hi>Sir</hi> Cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſley

Royal Katharine, <hi>have ſuffered much with loſs of Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As I ſaid the whole Fleets coninued driving all Night in a
Fogg, without ſeeing one another: The Morning following the
Wind came about to the Eaſt, when we all met, both <hi>Engliſh</hi>
and <hi>Dutch,</hi> and purſued the Enemy to the Weſt-ward; about
ten a Clock it cleared up, and we ſaw above Thirty Sail bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down, who about Noon came to an Anchor with the ſtrong
Flood Tide near <hi>Cherbourge;</hi> when the Wind came Weſt,
at the Night Flood the <hi>French</hi> got looſe; and plyed, and in
the Morning were at an Anchor near to <hi>Alderney;</hi> and we
without having better ground and leſs Tide, by Eight a
Clock happily found about Twenty Sail of their beſt Ships to
drive to the Eaſtward along their own Coaſts; and when it
was fit, our Admiral made the Sign to cut our Cables and
follow them, which we did, and Monſieur <hi>Tourville</hi>'s, and
Two other Three-Deck'd Ships, and Two Frigats run aſhore
at <hi>Cherbourge,</hi> and were ſince burnt by Sir <hi>Ralph Delaval:</hi>
Thirteen more of their Ships, of which Eight were Three-Deck'd,
run into <hi>La Hogue,</hi> near <hi>Cape Barfleur,</hi> and theſe thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen

            <p>Beſides theſe there were to this Squadron fourteen Frigats
and Fireſhips: This Squadron was compoſed of thirty ſix
Men of War, which carried on Board 12350 men and
2494 Guns.</p>

Scouts, Spyes and other Boats.</p>
            <p>But of theſe ſome of the Engliſh were either not ready,
or not all the Dutch Joyned, or were otherwiſe diſpoſed
of, for in the Engagement there was not quite Ninty Sale,
however ſo many as there were, are ſtill remaining through
the mercy of God, and the ſingular Care and Conduct of
the Admiral, who being ſafely arrived at <hi>Spithead,</hi> Her
Majeſty ordred ſome of the principal Nobility down
to Compliment him upon his proſperous Succeſs; and
Her Majeſty has made proviſion to give teſtimonies of Her

Approbation to all the reſt of the Officers of their Fidelity,
and Gallantry: And commanded a great ſum of Money to
be diſtributed amongſt the Seamen, who behaved themſelves
to Admiration. And thus ends the total Defeat of the
<hi>French</hi> Fleet, and the moſt conſiderable Action that ever
was done on theſe Seas; and earlier in the year then two
great Fleets ever fought in the memory of Man. Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
diſpatched away Expreſſes thereof to the King at his
Campe in <hi>Flanders,</hi> who has ſince acquainted his Allies
with it, by whom it was recieved with all the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations

Succeſſes to their Majeſties Arms.</p>
