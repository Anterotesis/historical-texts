         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Sermons under his owne

taken from his mouth, in the publi≈øhing of which,
the be≈øt care is and ≈øhall be taken, to publi≈øh them by,

be gotten. In both you have the Authours mind,
as neare as can be, expre≈ø≈øed, in his own words, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
adding or detracting. In the latter, you ≈øhall
finde the heads of the Sermons (which were all that
were la≈øt perfected by the Authour) in a methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Analy≈øis prefixed before them: they were his
owne, both for forme and words; onely what he
wrote in Latine, is tran≈ølated into Engli≈øh, for the
benefit of all, and the Latine you ≈øhall have in≈øerted
in the margin, in his own words, an≈øwerable to the

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Purpo≈øed to have entred into

fir≈øt words which ≈øtand as it

of ≈øpeciall inference from
the former, and therefore of
nece≈ø≈øary reference to them, tell me that I
mu≈øt borrow light at the next doore, that I
may walke inoffen≈øively. To give a touch
then of the coherence. You may take notice
of it, either as they depend upon the next ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes

in the whole building, and are as it were woven
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:220:9"/>
into the whole frame of the Apo≈øtles di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe.
The connexion with the precedent
ver≈øes is very ea≈øie and per≈øpicuous: you may
areed the meaning, if you will but read the
words, <hi>And all things are of God,</hi> &amp;c. the≈øe
are the words out of which you may ea≈øily
draw, and (with a little turning of the wheele
of your under≈øtanding) as it were ≈øpin the

by the bloud of Ie≈øus Chri≈øt: We have ≈øuch a

to ob≈øerve how the≈øe make to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
end and ≈øcope of the Apo≈øtle: give me
leave to go back a little, and take the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of a run, that I may the better open the
meaning of the≈øe words. The faithfull Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle
(as it is the condition of all that will be
faithfull) met with many rubs and much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition
at <hi>Corinth,</hi> e≈øpecially from the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of proud <hi>Phari≈øees</hi> and learned <hi>Rabbins</hi>
among them: among other things, his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
were laid in his di≈øh, and that ≈øcandall
of the meanene≈ø≈øe of his per≈øon, was interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as a reall prejudice again≈øt the truth of his
profe≈ø≈øion. You will ≈øay, a bruti≈øh collection,

outward impertinencies, rather than appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
they cannot fancy the truth, becau≈øe
of the ragged garment that ≈øhe weares. As on
the contrary, the tyrant boa≈øted that the Gods
approved of his ≈øacriledge, becau≈øe he ≈øailed
home with a faire gale of wind: <hi>Foelix ≈øcelus

of the ≈øincerity of their religion:
belike they have clipt the wings of pro≈øperity
(as the <hi>Athenians</hi> did the wings of victory) that
≈øhe cannot flie away from their Church: ≈øo

according to their barbarous divinity,

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:220:10"/>
though our per≈øon be contemptible; our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtery

ve≈ø≈øells, though they have but a ba≈øe matter,

Lord negligently,</hi> in the 10. and 11. Ver≈øe of
this Chapter, <hi>For we mu≈øt all appeare,</hi> &amp;c. and
though here were weight enough to ≈øet the

mo≈øt ru≈øty wheeles a going: yet becau≈øe the≈øe
two may work in ba≈øe minds, and are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves
but ≈øini≈øter ends, which many that ≈øeem
to goe ≈øtreight, may looke a ≈øquint upon: feare
in the foreward, and reward and hope in the
rereward mar≈øhall all his forces, and love in
the maine battell, or rather, <hi>tota in toto &amp; tota in
qualibet parte,</hi> animates every one to valour and
victory; puni≈øhment is ≈øervile, and hope of re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward
mercenary. He addes a third motive,
which is the peculiar character of a Chri≈øtian
mind, and that is love, in the 14 <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> of this
<hi>Chap. For the love of Chri≈øt con≈øtraineth us,</hi> this is
that which winds up his affections to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of zeal and fervencie. And I pray mark
the words. Reward hath an attractive, and
puni≈øhment an impul≈øive, but love hath a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pul≈øive
facultie. Reward drawes him, puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
drives him, but love hales him forward,
to the di≈øcharge of his duty: Hope like a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Mother entices him with a reward, feare
like a ≈øevere Ma≈øter incites him with puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but love like a Soveraigne Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
him. Hope hales before him, and feare
blowes behind him, and both on each ≈øide row
him, but love within him like the very ≈øoule
of obedience teaches him a naturall motion.
Behold againe a ≈øtrange agreement, force and
freedome, violent and voluntary, nece≈ø≈øity and
liberty met together, and married; and which
is more, the mo≈øt pure liberty with the mo≈øt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:220:11"/>
powerfull nece≈ø≈øity, <hi>For the love of Chri≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtraineth
us,</hi> the ≈øweete≈øt natured affection.
Love is growne a tyrant and will needs force
and ravi≈øh the virgin, freedome of will; which
hitherto hath been inviolate. Love con≈øtrains
not by <hi>forcible but by loving nece≈øsitie,</hi> as <hi>Plato</hi>

why doth not every man that is not a ≈øtocke

what he did, and therefore all the≈øe wrought
upon him, and encouraged him to doe it dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.
This is the handle on which they all

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:220:12"/>
for Chri≈øt, as though God did be≈øeech you

≈øee the words of their owne accord fall into
two parts. 1. Yee have the Amba≈ø≈øadors,
2. The Emba≈ø≈øage: The Amba≈ø≈øadors in the
fir≈øt words, <hi>We are Amba≈ø≈øadors for Chri≈øt,</hi>
The Emba≈ø≈øage in the re≈øt; and then the la≈øt
words of the fir≈øt part [<hi>for Christ</hi>] are as it
were the corner ≈øtone, in which the two build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are coupled; the middle ring, in which
the two extreames are joyned; the <hi>communis

the joynts upon which they turne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves,
and cla≈øp one with another: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
I may expre≈ø≈øe the ≈øame thing in better
termes, if I call the fir≈øt the charge, the ≈øecond
the di≈øcharge; the fir≈øt, the in≈øtitution of an
Office; the ≈øecond, the execution of it: In the
fir≈øt, we have one Propo≈øition con≈øi≈øting of a
≈øimple antecedent, and a triple con≈øequent;
the antecedent <hi>We,</hi> we are Amba≈ø≈øadors for
<hi>Chri≈øt:</hi> the primary con≈øequent is <hi>Amba≈ø≈øadors;
We are Amba≈ø≈øadors,</hi> which is attended with a
double illu≈øtration, and ≈øo altogether make a
treble attribution, as I told you: Fir≈øt from
the Object about which they are employed,
<hi>for Chri≈øt; We are Amba≈ø≈øadors for Chri≈øt:</hi> The
≈øecond from the Author, by whom they are
imployed, <hi>from God; We are Amba≈ø≈øadors for
Chri≈øt from God:</hi> indeed this is implyed in the
text, but mu≈øt be ≈øupplyed out of the context,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:220:12"/>
as you may ≈øee ea≈øily, and ≈øhall ≈øee ≈øhortly.
This is the fir≈øt part, and the ≈øecond is like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, as our Saviour ≈øaid of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
for there we have one propo≈øition like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe,
which hath a ≈øen≈øible proportion with
the former, but yet accompanied with ≈øome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
alterations: for, 1. It con≈øi≈øts of a
triple antecedent, and a ≈øimple con≈øequent
cleane contrary to it. 2. That which was the
con≈øequent before hath ≈øhifted his place, and
is now become the antecedent, the whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enriched with a new con≈øequent, which
was not in the former. 3. The three parts of
the con≈øequent have had a remove, that which
was la≈øt, is commended and preferred to be
fir≈øt; and which was fir≈øt, is degraded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to be la≈øt; only the middle, as the center,
is unmooved. And now thus it is; <hi>We are
Amba≈ø≈øadors for Chri≈øt from God,</hi> ther's the
antecedent, peeced out with the three parts of
the former con≈øequent: <hi>pray you be ye reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to God,</hi> ther's the con≈øequent, but the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

The ≈øecond, <hi>We as Amba≈øsadors pray you to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled

was ≈øo perplexed, that I am afraid my ≈øpeech
hath not given window enough to let in light
enough to cleare the pa≈ø≈øages: I am ≈øure I am
glad that I have wound my ≈øelfe out of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
Labyrinth, though I were to breake the
clue that guided me, and the thread of my di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe
pre≈øently.</p>
               <p>But now we have cut out the ≈øtuffe, we mu≈øt
goe about to make up the garment. To begin
with the fir≈øt. As the Stars in the Firmament
have a double vertue, of illumination and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
whereby they communicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:220:13"/>
to the inferiour bodies: So hath every
text in holy writ, an illumination of truth upon
the under≈øtanding, and an influence of grace
and goodne≈ø≈øe upon the will; and therefore I
will endeavour to ≈øhew your apprehen≈øions
the light of truth in the explication of the
words, ≈øo that they may ≈øhed their influence of
grace upon your affections in their application.
The fir≈øt word that offers it ≈øelfe to our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
is the ≈øubject <hi>we:</hi> which though it be
≈øo concrete with that which followes in the
originall that it hath lo≈øt it ≈øelfe, for there all
that ≈øentence is wrapped up in one word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>;
as the le≈ø≈øer Starres when they have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
in too near a degree of propinquity
to the Sunne, as it were con≈øcious of their own
pre≈øumption, they dare not be ≈øeene, or el≈øe
they forfeit their light to the Sunne their ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne,
and are eclip≈øed. Yet a good Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician,
with his <hi>Prometheus</hi> fire, would ≈øever
the≈øe heterogeneals, and re≈øolve them into
their pure and primitive natures, and then
would appeare a paire of arguments, be≈øides
the yoke that holds them together, as our
tran≈ølation renders it, <hi>We are Amba≈øsadors.</hi>
Well then, that fir≈øt word (that we may take
the ju≈øt mea≈øure of the meaning of it) mu≈øt be
con≈øidered in three degrees of latitude. 1. It
re≈øpects him≈øelfe. 2. All his fellow Apo≈øtles.
3. All his Fellow-labourers in the Lords har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve≈øt.
The body of it moves within him≈øelfe,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:220:14"/>
as in his proper and particular Spheare, the
beames are ca≈øt abroad upon all the Apo≈øtles
in a direct and perpendicular line, the beautie
and lu≈øtre diffu≈øeth it ≈øelfe yet further in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall
liberality to every Mini≈øter of the
Word; I, and they, and all, we are Amba≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
for <hi>Christ.</hi> 1. Him≈øelfe, I, who was an
abortive birth, a ≈øtranger, a wolfe, a per≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
a traitor, an enemy to the grace of God,
in my be≈øt principles of nature; I am become,
by the rich mercy of God, a darling ≈øonne, a
Subject, a Shepheard, a Preacher, a Favourite,
an Amba≈ø≈øador of the grace of God in <hi>Ie≈øus
Chri≈øt:</hi> I am an Amba≈ø≈øador. Thus the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtle
chewes as it were upon his office, as the
wounded <hi>Hart</hi> upon the famous <hi>Dictamum,</hi>
and all the poi≈øoned Arrowes of reproach and
obloquy, drop off. Thus he ≈øhakes the <hi>Viper</hi>
off his hand, which tho≈øe barbarous enemies
thought to have beene deadly<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> but the rea≈øon
why he ≈øpeakes in the plurall number, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe
of humility partly, and partly of wi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
It is the language of humility, when a
man is urged to a nece≈ø≈øary<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> ≈øelfe-prai≈øe, and
forced by the importunity of others, to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
him≈øelf, yet to qualifie his ≈øpeech as much
as may be. So doth the Apo≈øtle here excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently,
it ≈øeemes good to him to di≈øtribute this
honour to many, that he may not ≈øeeme to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
too much to him≈øelfe, and this plurall
number is a phra≈øe of ≈øingular humility, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:220:14"/>
thus the ≈øtile of Princes runnes (we will and
our plea≈øure) joyning their Coun≈øell or the
whole State with them≈øelves: For I rather
take that frequent anomalie for an intimation
of mode≈øty, then of maje≈øtie, though I am not
ignorant how others apprehend it. Again here
is a my≈øtery of wi≈ødome in this word. For as
a Deere that is eagerly pur≈øued will immer≈øe
it ≈øelfe into the whole heard, that ≈øo ≈øhe may
≈øu≈øpend the violence of the cha≈øe, by the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity
of the choi≈øe in ≈øuch variety of game:
So <hi>Paul</hi> being ≈øingled out by calumny, doth
mingle him≈øelfe with the whole fellow≈øhip of
Apo≈øtles. Or as one in danger of arre≈øting
will take ≈øanctuary in ≈øome priviledged place:
So <hi>Paul</hi> takes ≈øanctuary at the Colledge of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtles.
2. This word be≈øides the particular
appropriation which it hath to <hi>Paul</hi> him≈øelfe,
mu≈øt needs be interpreted, according to the
true propriety of the number, and meaning;
and ≈øo it extends it ≈øelfe. 1. To all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles.
2. To all Mini≈øters of the Word, both
of them are Amba≈ø≈øadors, for they agree in the
≈øub≈øtance of their commi≈ø≈øion, though there
be ≈øome difference in the circum≈øtance of the
execution: the Apo≈øtolike office, indeed, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
a more lively re≈øemblance of an Amba≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage,
then the ordinary Mini≈øtery, in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards.
1. They were authorized by <hi>Chri≈øt</hi>
him≈øelfe, and ≈øo received their in≈øtructions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from his mouth, who is the King of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:220:15"/>
the Church; and accordingly were furni≈øhed
with all ≈øufficiencies, by the in≈øpiration of
his Spirit; they be≈øtowed not much time and
travaile to ≈øpeake forreine languages, (a thing
nece≈ø≈øary for Amba≈ø≈øadors) but as <hi>E≈øaie's</hi>
tongue was touched by a <hi>Seraphim</hi> with a cole
from the Altar, ≈øo they had cloven and fiery
tongues, be≈øtowed on them by the Spirit: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øide
that, they had the gift of miracles, as it
were the broad ≈øeale of Heaven, annexed to
their letters of credit. But with our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters
it is not ≈øo, but they are brought up at the
feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and trained up in the Schooles
of the Prophets, and purcha≈øe their abilities (as
he in the <hi>Acts</hi> did his freedome) with a great
≈øumme of labour, and time, and co≈øt: and then
the Church the Spou≈øe of <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> ≈øince her
Lords departure, as a Matron, weares the keyes
of authority at her girdle, opens to them a
doore of utterance and admits them to the ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Altar. As they had a more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall
mi≈ø≈øion, ≈øo they had a motion more
ob≈øervable, which addes as it were life and ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to the image, and picture of Amba≈ø≈øadors.
They were di≈øpatched into all coa≈øts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the world; but ours are fa≈øtned to ≈øome
one place, like pillars of re≈øidence; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding
the≈øe petty differences, ≈øeeing
they have the ≈øame ≈øphear of activity, in which
they moove, to reconcile men to God, and the
≈øame Sun of authority, by which they moove,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:220:15"/>
the power of the Church, being the power of
<hi>Chri≈øt</hi> derived to her, (as we call them the
Kings officers, who are created not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
by his Maje≈øtie, but in vertue of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and in ≈øubordination to his Royall prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative)
And la≈øtly, ≈øeeing the ≈øimilitude may
be pre≈øerved entire in both, though this varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be confe≈ø≈øed: there being a difference in the
type Amba≈ø≈øadors, much like that in the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type
of Mini≈øters; ≈øo that either may an≈øwer
the patterne: And our ordinary Mini≈øters ≈øute
with agents or leiger Amba≈ø≈øadors, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtles
came neerer to extraordinary. In all
the≈øe re≈øpects they al≈øo being included, the
whole extent of this word <hi>We</hi> hath three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees:
1. Him≈øelfe, 2. All his fellow Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles,
3. All his fellow-labourers in the Lords
harve≈øt. I have made ≈øome ha≈øte, but the
time I feare hath over runne me much, and
therefore for that which is behind of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
I will lay downe but the rude linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and proportion, and leave the perfect
colours and complexion to another time. The
≈øecond word (<hi>Amba≈ø≈øadors</hi>) is a ≈øpeech bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
from Princes Courts, and applyed to
<hi>Chri≈øt</hi> his Church, by a decent analogy. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øadors
are me≈ø≈øengers from one Prince or
State to another, about ≈øuch affaires as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
both. You may ob≈øerve three moments
of being, in this rude de≈øcription; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
draw out three paralell lines, in which,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:220:16"/>
the termes of compari≈øon do runne along one
by another in a ≈øweet proportion. 1. They are
both Me≈ø≈øengers. 2. They are both from
Princes. 3. They are both about matters of
mutuall behoofe.</p>
               <p>But, becau≈øe you know a ≈øimilitude is a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thing, and mu≈øt be gently handled, you
mu≈øt not ≈øqueize it too much, and ≈øtretch it too
farre, le≈øt you breake the harmony and analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
the Mu≈øicke and Logicke of the parts; I

with ≈øome be≈øeeming port and pompe, that

third word of the Text remaines, [<hi>for Chri≈øt</hi>]

but a delineation of the≈øe things: only give
me leave to clo≈øe up all, with one ob≈øervation
out of the words: I noted before that this ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
[<hi>We are Amba≈ø≈øadors</hi>] is clo≈øer tru≈ø≈øed
up in the Originall, into one word <gap reason="foreign">

abated, and very dilute, almo≈øt lo≈øt in the tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
for that word of action, ≈øignifying the
office, may tell us ≈øo much in our eares, that
tho≈øe officers mu≈øt be men of action, they mu≈øt
be of a nimble and active con≈øtitution. The
men of the earth may be of a more dull and ≈øad
temper, they may fold their armes, they may
≈øtretch them≈øelves upon their beds of Ivory,
and turne them≈øelves upon them, as the doore
turnes upon the hinges: But the≈øe Me≈ø≈øengers

if they but once forget their daily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈ø≈øe.
They that preach <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> the Sonne of

that are frozen to their lu≈øts, and will

That Mini≈øters of the Word, are Gods Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øadors.
I touched lightly both the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtantiall

not ≈øome of tho≈øe glorious Cherubims, and

why are not ≈øome of the≈øe preferred to this

for the≈øe things?</hi> But it is time to frame an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer:
Though neither our ≈øhallow capacitie
can ≈øound the depth of Gods coun≈øels, nor he
be bound to render a rea≈øon of his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
yet he gives us both liberty to enquire
with ≈øobriety, and light to finde out ≈øo much
that we may go away with rea≈øonable ≈øatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And therefore I pray ob≈øerve with
me three principall Rea≈øons, why the Lord
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:220:20"/>
who wants neither wi≈ødome, or power, to
contrive it otherwi≈øe, either by immediate ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiation,
upon the under≈øtanding, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
into the will, or by the mini≈øterie of the
ble≈ø≈øed Angels, yet thought good rather to
make u≈øe of the helpe of man, for the bringing
of man to him≈øelfe, and working that mighty
worke of conver≈øion, which our Divines have
thought, and taught not without ≈øome proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
of rea≈øon, to be greater than the great
worke of the fir≈øt creation. The fir≈øt, I take
to be from the nature of the thing, wherewith
this order ≈øtands in greater congruity divers
wayes: For fir≈øt of all, ≈øuppo≈øing things <hi>in ≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu
quo,</hi> that God will have men de≈øcend by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
propagation, and divide them≈øelves into
politicall ≈øocieties; of which, and out of
which, he will call ≈øome to grace, which ≈øhall
come by degrees, not powred in all at once,
but dropped in, <hi>by little and little, here a
line, and there a line.</hi> It ≈øures not with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Angels, to have ≈øuch ordinary, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible
commerce with men, as is nece≈ø≈øary to
accompli≈øh this: for men in this ca≈øe, mu≈øt be
alwaies feeding, as children u≈øe, and mu≈øt have
continuall hand and tending: well indeed they
may be dry nur≈øes, to watch, and pre≈øerve, and
protect the children of God; but to be fathers
to beget them by the immortall ≈øeed of the
Word, to be wet nur≈øes, to ≈øuccle them with
the ≈øyncere pure milke of the Word, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:220:21"/>
be. So that, unle≈ø≈øe we would imagine
the whole face of nature changed, and all
moulded into a new frame, this peece would
not hold proportion with the re≈øt. Nay, it
were a thing irregular, and a kinde of violence
to the Angelicall nature, to conver≈øe with men
in this kinde, whereas we all know, <hi>nullum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olentum
e≈øt perpetuum,</hi> there be few Analogies,
but there be none Anomalies that are perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
Indeed the Lord u≈øes them for the good
of man many times, but their part is not to be
alwayes on the Stage. 2. By this meanes,
man is drawne to God in ≈øuch a manner, as is
mo≈øt convenient for his nature, not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his compo≈øition (for by preaching of
the Word, his ≈øen≈øible part is wrought upon,
and affected) but al≈øo in regard of his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
for as in the free motions of nature, there
is (that I may u≈øe a di≈øtinction ≈øomething nice
for the termes, but nece≈ø≈øary for the thing) I
≈øay, a cooperation, without any coaction: ≈øo
in the fir≈øt motion of grace, though the Lord
worke with a certaine infallibility, and as I
may ≈øay, a ≈øweet nece≈ø≈øity, yet he doth not offer
violence to any principle of nature, which hath
≈øome evidence, ever from this, that God<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
workes it by man; ≈øo that if you looke to both
the cau≈øes, the principall, and in≈øtrumentall,
you may ≈øay it is the work of God, therefore
there is no po≈ø≈øibilitie of re≈øi≈øtance; it is the
work of man, therefore there is no ≈øhew nor
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:220:21"/>
≈øhadowes of violence: and the≈øe two mu≈øt goe

no ba≈øe bribe: So may we ≈øay in this ca≈øe,

fully, for feare of unkind con≈øtructions, but
that I mu≈øt make ha≈øte. 3. There is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
that ≈øeeing the Sonne of God became
the ≈øonne of man, that the ≈øons of men might
become the ≈øonnes of God; and we having all
received of his fulne≈ø≈øe grace for grace, his
gifts of grace ≈øhould be conveighed as by a

all men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the organicall parts of that
body, which receive ≈øen≈øe, and motion, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
from the head: and for this purpo≈øe,
he is (as the head) <hi>annointed with the oyle of
gladne≈ø≈øe above his fellowes,</hi> that is, in greater
mea≈øure, and above, that from him it may di≈øtil
by the higher to the lowe≈øt members. Now
the Angels are not univocall members with

of <hi>Chri≈øts</hi> merit, whether it may any way
redound to tho≈øe ble≈ø≈øed Spirits, I will neither
peremptorily deny, nor di≈øpute for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent:
and therefore it is more meet, the Word
≈øhould be committed to men than Angels, or

tryed this, for when the <hi>Lord appeared to them
in Mount Sinai with thunder and lightning,</hi> they
pre≈øently found their owne weakne≈ø≈øe, and
made ≈øuit to <hi>Mo≈øes, Let not the Lord ≈øpeake unto

whom the Lord makes choice of, to
be≈øtow the riches of his grace upon, not the

ones. Now as you have ≈øeene in a Faire, the
Countrey people will not venture into the rich

be≈øtow their money on ≈øome countrey Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
≈øo it may bee in this ca≈øe: and
therefore the Lord appoints men, and meane
men, that even the meane≈øt Chri≈øtians may
more freely repaire unto them. 2. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the mini≈øtery of Men, is more credible then
Angels, or any other could be; for though
their te≈øtimony be of more weight in it ≈øelfe,
by rea≈øon of their acurate knowledge, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
fidelity; yet I know not how a man may
have more advantages to deale with us: for to
let pa≈ø≈øe the irrefragable authority of the word
of God, upon which all divine truths mu≈øt
≈øtand, which would be needle≈ø≈øe, if it plea≈øed
God to take any other cour≈øe than this; and to
omit that it is hard to give ≈øuch infallible cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
wherby divine illuminations, might be
di≈øtingui≈øhed from diabolicall illu≈øions, that
all ambignity might be taken away; I ≈øay,
1. Fir≈øt, men conver≈øe with us, are knowne,
they are our brethren, fle≈øh of our fle≈øh, and
bone of our bone, and therefore what ≈øu≈øpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:220:23"/>
can ari≈øe, that they, who are otherwi≈øe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
≈øhould goe about to deceive us, in a
thing that is as much worth as our ≈øoule is.
2. They cannot deceive others, but they mu≈øt
deceive their owne ≈øoule, being they are in <hi>e√¢<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
navi,</hi> in the ≈øame condition. 3. They
confirme their owne words, and adde a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
of practice to the text of preaching,
with their workes; and by ta≈øting them≈øelves
of what they pre≈øcribe to us, ≈øecuring us of
all feare of poy≈øon. 4. La≈øtly, they may, and
doe ≈øometimes ≈øet a ≈øeale of ≈øuffering to their
≈øaying: but I pa≈ø≈øe to the third. Thirdly, the
mini≈øtery of men is mo≈øt effectuall, as for
tho≈øe re≈øpects touched before, and becau≈øe
they ≈øymbolize in qualities; whereas Philo≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
teacheth, that there is ea≈øie≈øt tran≈ømutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
where there is a Symbolicall quality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the agent and the patient: and becau≈øe
they ≈øympathize in nature, ≈øo that there may be
a ≈øecret attractive power, as we ≈øee in the
Load≈øtone to the Iron, or rather a mutuall
con≈øpiring to embrace one another: So
even by the very art of per≈øwading: I know
not what the tongue-eloquence of Angels is,
and the Apo≈øtle ≈øeems to mention them with
intimation of excellency, neither will I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
again≈øt all commers that a man may be a
better Orator than an Angell: but I know the
Lord is, and he hath put his Word into the
mouth of man, he that made the heart and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:220:24"/>
tryes the reines, he knowes how to frame
words that will affect the heart, and ≈øo they
doe in≈øinuate them≈øelves into the darke≈øt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of it with wondrous power and efficacie.
And this I know and dare avouch, that the
highe≈øt my≈øterie in the Divine Rhetorick is to
feele what a man ≈øpeakes, and then ≈øpeak what
a man feeles.<note place="margin">

heart. But as this ordinance is profitable to
men, becau≈øe it is honourable to the Mini≈øter,

utility redounds to both. For thirdly, it
is one of the ≈øtronge≈øt bonds of love betweene

knot to tie man and God together, God ≈øpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

his Amba≈ø≈øadors, and it mu≈øt not be omitted,
becau≈øe it is the mo≈øt principall among the

that cou≈øened him≈øelfe with a ≈øilly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logi≈øme,

it withall: <hi>Quae ferramenta, quae machinae,

perhaps, I ≈øay, he, when he heard of Amba≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors

he in his wi≈ødome u≈øes this cour≈øe, for the
cau≈øe alledged. It is time to conclude, but
yet give me leave to confirme this with two
places of Scripture, and two examples: The
fir≈øt is the 2 <hi>Corinth 4. 7. But we have this
trea≈øure in earthen ve≈øsels, that the excellencie of
the power may be of God and not of us:</hi> I will not
urge it becau≈øe I have u≈øed it before, ≈øince I
entred into this argument. The ≈øecond is, the
1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1. from 17. to the end of the <hi>Chapter,</hi>
a known Text, where as Apo≈øtle di≈øcour≈øes
this at large, The ≈øumme is this: <hi>It plea≈øed God
by the fooli≈øhne≈ø≈øe of Preaching to ≈øave them that

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:220:26"/>
wherefore is this? <hi>God hath cho≈øen the fooli≈øh
things of this world, to confound the wi≈øe, and God
hath cho≈øen the weake things of the world, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the things that are mighty, and ba≈øe things

no fle≈øh ≈øhould glory in his pre≈øence:</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion
of all is according as it is written, <hi>He
that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</hi> The words
need no Commentary, and therefore I pa≈ø≈øe to
the examples. The fir≈øt you ≈øhall finde in the

the <hi>Midianites by Gideon,</hi> who at fir≈øt had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

were too many for the Lord to worke with,
therefore he will have them as it were boyled
by two decoctions, till they ≈øunke fir≈øt to ten

to three hundred, and then they march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt
the enemy, who were more then one
hundred and thirty thou≈øand, and covered the
land like Gra≈øhoppers: but I pray, how were
the≈øe three hundred appointed? we doe not

choi≈øe of the≈øe the rather, among infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,

is but like the ≈øounding of Rams-hornes (in

≈øhaking of the wals of <hi>Iericho,</hi> towards the

Trumpet of the Go≈øpell, and in his martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
break his body, like ≈øome earthen pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that the glory of God might breake forth,
through the humane frailtie, like a Lamp, and
≈øhine more bright and cleare. But I mu≈øt pa≈ø≈øe
over the≈øe, I will touch but one thing, and
≈øo conclude: for there is yet another re≈øpect
in which God gets glory by this order, and
that is, becau≈øe by this meanes, he takes try all
of the obedience of his children, whether they
will entertaine ≈øuch homely me≈ø≈øengers for his
≈øake, who ≈øends them, and yeeld obedience to
him, who≈øe will they publi≈øh. But too much
of this argument, which I am affraid ≈øome
may think needle≈ø≈øe, or fruitle≈ø≈øe: and the truth
is, I ≈øhould not have gone ≈øo farre in this path,
if I had not ob≈øerved ≈øome worthies of <hi>I≈ørael</hi>

preferre your ≈øervants, before the ≈øervants of
your God, that they be brave and co≈øtly, and
the≈øe be ba≈øe and beggarly, I will never em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace

that will pick a hole in the coat of Gods
true ≈øervants, his Amba≈ø≈øadors, that ≈øo they
may picke a quarrell with Gods true religion:
I may not thinke ≈øo. And yet I thinke I may
take occa≈øion here, to take away all occa≈øion
of doubting, that may perhaps ari≈øe in ≈øome
weake judgements. For as <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> could not
better apprehend, or expre≈ø≈øe the magnitude
of God, then by the magnificence of the King
of <hi>Per≈øia:</hi> ≈øo there may be ≈øome babes in <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi>
not throughly weaned from the vanities of this
world, that would require ≈øome outward emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies
in the Mini≈øters of the Word, to prove
that they are Gods Amba≈ø≈øadors; which if
they be wanting, though they dare not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
the truth, becau≈øe they profe≈ø≈øe to believe
≈øo much, yet they cannot conceive the my≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
becau≈øe they do not believe ≈øo much as they
profe≈ø≈øe. And therefore having cleared this the
la≈øt time, why God made choi≈øe of meane
men for this honourable office, rather then of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:220:29"/>
the Glorious Cherubims, and Seraphims, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then of the ≈øonnes of the mighty: give
me leave now to produce ≈øome few evidences,
by which it may appeare, that the≈øe men are
indeed Gods Amba≈ø≈øadors. The ground of
this is plaine (as I touched al≈øo before) for
this great world, is a little Kingdome, wherein<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
God is the ≈øoveraign Lord, the King of Kings,
and all men for their po≈ø≈øie≈ø≈øions, are his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants;
for their functions, his Lievtenants; and
in this great world, the little flock of <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> is
a great family, in which, God is the great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter
of the family. There can nothing be done
in this family, in this Kingdome, without the
authority of this Ma≈øter, of this King, and
therefore the Mini≈øters of the Word, mu≈øt
needs be di≈øpen≈øers of his ≈øpeciall favour, in
the great family of his Church, from him, as
from the great Ma≈øter of this family. And
againe, Amba≈ø≈øadors of his Royall plea≈øure, in
his Kingdome of the world, from him, as from
their ≈øupreme Lord the King of Kings. But
why doe I produce the ground? the Text is
plaine: <hi>We are Amba≈ø≈øadors for Chri≈øt,</hi> and if
you ca≈øt your eyes back to the foregoing <hi>ver≈øe,</hi>
you ≈øhall ≈øee from whom, namely <hi>from God.</hi>

their very countenance, ≈øhould command as
much reverence, as the Pontificall garments,
in which <hi>Iuddus</hi> the high Prie≈øt met with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
the Great, who was ≈øo affected with
that augu≈øte ≈øtate, and bravery of them, that he
fell downe at his feet, and wor≈øhipped him, as
<hi>Io≈øephus</hi> records. I have done with the in≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:
a word or two of incouragement.</p>
               <p>I will not be ≈øo bold my ≈øelfe, but I would
commend any thing, to ≈øome that were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to put our great Rabbins in mind, wherein
their honour lies: it is not Silks, nor Velvets,
nor Scarlet, nor a goodly traine (what doe I
≈øpeake of the≈øe) it is not Throns, nor Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
nor Powers, nor any dignities, that can
make a man ≈øo truly honourable, as the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Go≈øpell to poore ≈øoules, to be Gods
Amba≈ø≈øadors, ≈øurely they are mi≈øtaken, they
need not feare, the frequency in this duty,
≈øhould prove a di≈øparagement or imminution
to greatne≈ø≈øe. Excellently ≈øaith our Saviour,
<hi>All power is given unto me both in Heaven
and Earth:</hi> I will now prefer all my ≈øervants,
and make you Lords and Rulers, but wot yee
how? it followes, <hi>Go preach to all Nations,</hi> but
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:220:58"/>
this, by the way. I conclude this with a
word to ≈øome, with whom I may be bold. Let
no man here that is in a way to the Mini≈øtery,
believe the fal≈øe ≈øpies that rai≈øe an ill report
upon that good land, that flowes with milk and
honey. I will ≈øay no more now, but is it thinke
you a ba≈øe thing and ≈øordid, to be Amba≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
to the King of Heaven? I will repeat it
once more, becau≈øe I can ≈øcarce heare without
≈øome indignation, that that ≈øhould be a maxime
in the worlds Heraldrie, for earthly Kings, once
Amba≈ø≈øador, ever honourable: And it is a ba≈øe
thing to be Amba≈ø≈øadors for the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
And now I come to the third deduction,
concerning the people, which I mu≈øt run over.
I ≈øhall not need to tell you, that you mu≈øt not
offer any di≈øcourte≈øie to the≈øe Amba≈ø≈øadors:
Amba≈ø≈øadors are inviolable by the law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
and the Lord hath ≈øet a better mark then
<hi>Cain</hi> had, and given them a better pa≈øport, <hi>touch
not mine annointed, and do my Prophets no harm:</hi>
And if any ≈øhould ri≈øe up again≈øt them, I would
tell them boldly, what one whi≈øpered in the
Captains eare, when he was ≈øomthing too bu≈øie
with <hi>Paul, Take heed what thou doe≈øt, this man is a
Romane:</hi> Take heed what thou doe≈øt, this man
is an Amba≈ø≈øador. The <hi>Romans</hi> ≈øacked the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Corinth</hi> and razedit to the ground, for a
little di≈øcourte≈øie they offer'd to their Amba≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors:
And what ≈øhall the Lord of the Vineyard
doe to tho≈øe husbandmen, that beat and ≈øton'd
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:220:58"/>
and killd his ≈øervants, that he ≈øends unto them?
It is a ≈øymptome of a di≈øordered and de≈øperate
e≈øtate. When the≈øe Amba≈ø≈øadors are violated,
we pull all Gods judgements upon our heads,
with the chaines of our ≈øinnes: but this is the
linke of the chaine that immediately drawes
them. It is a remarkable place, in the la≈øt of the
<hi>Chronicles, Moreover all the chiefe of the Prie≈øts
and the people tran≈øgre≈ø≈øed very much after all the
abominations of the Heathen, and polluted the hou≈øe
of the Lord, that he hallowed at Ieru≈øalem:</hi> here be
many links, but ob≈øerve that followes, <hi>And the
Lord God of their Fathers ≈øent to them by his Me≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øengers,
ri≈øing up betimes and ≈øending, becau≈øe he had
compa≈øsion on his people, and on his dwelling place.
But they mocked the me≈øsengers of God, and de≈øpi≈øed
his words, and mi≈øu≈øed his Prophets</hi> (this is the
la≈øt linke, and ye ≈øee judgement fa≈øtned, chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and linked to it) <hi>untill the wrath of the Lord
aro≈øe again≈øt his people, till there was no remedie.
Therefore he brought upon them the Chaldees, &amp;c.</hi>
I pa≈ø≈øe from this. When <hi>Ehud</hi> told the King of
<hi>Moab, I have a Me≈ø≈øage to thee from God, O King,
he ro≈øe from his thron and bowed him≈øelf.</hi> I think
it was <hi>Francis</hi> that ≈øaid, if he ≈øhould meet a
Preacher and an Angell together, he would
fir≈øt ≈øalute the Preacher, and the Angell after.
I am ≈øure <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaith of the <hi>Galathians,</hi> that they
received him as an Angell of God, yea as <hi>Ie≈øus
Chri≈øt,</hi> and that they would have plucked out
their eyes for him, <hi>how beautifull are the feet of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:220:59"/>
tho≈øe upon the mountaines that bring the glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of Peace,</hi> ≈øaith the Church in the Prophet:
the Spou≈øe of <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> is ≈øo humble, or mode≈øt,
or both, that ≈øhee dares looke no higher then
the feet, and yet ≈øhe ≈øpies <hi>beautifull,</hi> written in
the very du≈øt of their feet (as you have ≈øeene a
contrary word other where) and that in ≈øuch le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
characters, that ≈øhe reads it afar off, before
they come neare her, <hi>upon the mountaines,</hi> as
though it had beene written with a Sun beame
upon ≈øome Ea≈øterne hill in a goodly morning:
and tho≈øe letters printed ≈øuch affection in her,
that being not able to expre≈ø≈øe it by art, ≈øhee
throwes down her pen≈øill, (as you have heard
of the Painter) and expre≈ø≈øes it with a pa≈ø≈øion,
or rather, ≈øhe ≈øhadowes that ≈øhe could not ≈øet
forth in a patheticall exclamation: <hi>How beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
are the feet of tho≈øe upon the mountaines, that
bring glad tydings of peace!</hi> and what ≈øhe did in
≈øpeeches, <hi>Mary</hi> in the Go≈øpell ≈øpake in deed,
<hi>≈øhe fell downe at the feet of Chri≈øt, ≈øhe broke her box
of precious ointment and powred it upon them,</hi> ≈øhe
let fall a ≈øhower of more precious tears, (peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
teares are ≈øomething like to pearls, but that
they are more precious) with which ≈øhe wa≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them: ≈øhe wiped them with a mo≈øt precious
towell, the haires of her head: me thinks the≈øe
golden haires were like to threads of gold, with
which <hi>Mary</hi> tyed her ≈øelf (as it were) in a true
lovers knot to her be≈øt beloved Saviour. Would
you know plainly what entertainment you mu≈øt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:220:59"/>
give the≈øe Amba≈ø≈øadors. I will tell you in a
word. Give attention, credit, obedience to their
words: if they thunder and lighten out of
Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> if the Lion roare, let the proude≈øt
bea≈øt in the forre≈øt quake and tremble: if Mount
<hi>Sion</hi> let fall her ≈øilver drops, if the ≈øilver trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
of the Go≈øpell ≈øound peace and comfort,
let the poore≈øt worm forget that he creeps up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the earth, and think he hath a title to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
I know you long till I make an end, and ≈øo
do I too. To conclude therefore: I wi≈øh you
could forget all that hath beene ≈øpoken, and
blot it out of your memory, to fa≈øten this one
thing which I am now to ≈øay. Let this be our
remembrance when we go to the Lords hou≈øe,
I go now to heare what Gods Amba≈ø≈øadors
≈øhall ≈øay unto me: they that dre≈ø≈øe them≈øelves
to go with any colder or ba≈øer conceits, may
well bee checked, as <hi>Caligula</hi> was wont to ≈øay
tyrannically, what <hi>Antidotum contra Cae≈øarem:</hi>
and that is a reall crime in them only, which
was a ridiculous accu≈øation of <hi>Trebonius, Quod
telum toto pectore non exceperit.</hi> Again let this be
our meditation, when we returne from thence,
with benefit, <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed be thou, and ble≈ø≈øed be thy
coun≈øell, and ble≈ø≈øed be the Lord that ≈øent thee out to
meet me this day:</hi> Surely this is a man of God,
a man of Heaven: tell me, O you that are cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
lingui≈øts, did he not ≈øpeak with the tongue
of Angels? was not I in heaven while I heard
him? is it but an imaginary fancie? or did I
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:220:60"/>
heare the more then <hi>Pythagorean</hi> harmony of
the ≈øphears? His words like Soveraigne balme
dropt into my wounded ≈øoule, like the ≈øweet
influence of the <hi>Pleiades</hi> upon this lower world:
me thought, I felt my heart (while he ≈øpake)
≈øhoot up into my eares, as it were to meet and
ki≈ø≈øe the ble≈ø≈øed lips, which di≈øtilled ≈øuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
dew, ≈øuch golden ≈øhowres, and drinke
them as the parched, and thir≈øty earth the dew
of Heaven: and yet, in the ≈øweet remembrance
thereof, <hi>My ≈øoule magnifieth the Lord, and my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
rejoyceth in God my Saviour.</hi> Ble≈ø≈øed be the
Lord that hath ≈øent his Angels, (as he did to
<hi>Peter</hi>) to draw me out of the dungeon of ≈øinne
and mi≈øery, that hath ≈øent his Amba≈ø≈øadors, as
<hi>David</hi> did to <hi>Hanun,</hi> to comfort me. <hi>Signa

into the meaning of the words, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient

me to ≈øeeke farther then I needed: yet I
re≈øolved when I had done, not to trouble you
with any thing in this kinde, but then it was too
late, I was compelled by another nece≈ø≈øity.
Wherefore I mu≈øt intreat you to accept it as it
is. The Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul,</hi> like a faithfull labourer
in the Lords Vineyard, had planted a Church
at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and watered it with a whole yeares
Preaching, as it were, ≈øhowring downe the
≈øweet dewes of Heaven upon it. After his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
though he had both his hands full of
other imployments, yet, being jealous of the
≈øucce≈ø≈øe of his labour, both his eyes were
watchfull, if he might by any meanes further
the worke he had begun: being thus de≈øirous,
there could not want occa≈øion: For behold ere
long, both his eares are filled with newes from
<hi>Corinth; Tho≈øe of the hou≈øe of Chloe,</hi> on the one
≈øide, welwillers to the welfare of the Church,
have recour≈øe to him, to informe him of ≈øome
corruptions wherewith the Church was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled:
for the envious man had ≈øowne Tares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the good Seed, while the good man was

the other ≈øide, make repair to him to be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in ≈øome que≈øtions, wherw<hi rend="sup">th</hi> their con≈øcience
was troubled: for the gracious Lord had ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed
the labour of his good ≈øervant in planting
and watering, with a ble≈ø≈øed increa≈øe. And thus
you ≈øee a double occa≈øion of writing, which
makes a double argument of this golden Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle.

end of the Epi≈øtle concerning que≈øtions: <hi>Sed

≈øuch as were generally committed by all, not

Ince≈øt mu≈øt be cured by cutting; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian

mind, a ≈øimple meaning, and a ≈øyncere
manner in the Preaching of the Word, that ≈øo
the glory of God may be advanced, and all the
pride of man trampled in the du≈øt.</p>
               <p>The argument of Schi≈øme is continued from
the 10. of the 1. to the end of the 4. Chapter,

               <p>The ≈øumme of the Letter is an exhortation
to unitie from one argument e≈øpecially, and is
couched and concluded in this Enthymeme,
<hi>You are all one in Chri≈øt Ie≈øus who is one, you agree
with one mind, and one mouth:</hi> the Propo≈øition
being ≈øuppo≈øed as very rea≈øonable, and therfore
≈øuppre≈ø≈øed as not very nece≈ø≈øary. The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion
is propo≈øed in the tenth of the fir≈øt, where
becau≈øe it ≈øtands (as it were) in the forefront
without the premi≈øes, it is guarded on the one
≈øide with a ≈øweet entreatie, <hi>I be≈øeech you brethren:</hi>
on the other ≈øide with a ≈øound authority, <hi>By the
name of the Lord Ie≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> being (as it were)
edged with the one, the ≈øweet entreatie; and
backed with the other, the ≈øound authority, that
it might the better peirce into the very tower
of their affections; and force them with a ≈øure
charme to all ≈øyncere obedience, and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion
iterated in the 14. of the 4. clo≈øes up
the whole argument.</p>
               <p>The A≈ø≈øumption follows in the 13. of the 1.
whetted, as it were, and pointed, with nimble
interrogations, which all ≈øpeake as Spaniards
in the language of Pike, with invincible po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
and unavoidable nece≈ø≈øity, that <hi>Chri≈øt</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:220:67"/>
is the onely one, and undivided Saviour.</p>
               <p>But here the <hi>Corinthians</hi> barre up the way
with an objection, which is in≈øinuated in the
12. ver≈øe, and is but in≈øinuated in the whole
progre≈ø≈øe: yet ≈øo, that you may ea≈øily perceive
that all <hi>Pauls</hi> paines in the foure fir≈øt Chapters,
is ≈øpent in the remoovall of this rub, the antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of this objection: Now this it is.</p>
               <p>Though there be but one <hi>Christ,</hi> one Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter,
yet there be many of <hi>Chri≈øts</hi> Mini≈øters, and
they have different gifts; one likes <hi>Pauls</hi> ≈øimple
per≈øpicuitie; others, <hi>Apollos</hi> ample plentie; a
third, <hi>Cephas</hi> ≈øolid potency; and therefore, why
may not I apply my ≈øelf to <hi>Paul,</hi> I, to <hi>Apollo,</hi>
I, to <hi>Cephas?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This their di≈øcour≈øe (if you marke it) is a
di≈øcovery of all the cau≈øes of their di≈øorder.
They are two: the <hi>bewitching tongues</hi> of the
teachers, and, the <hi>itching eares</hi> of the people:
the teachers arrogance, the peoples ignorance.
The teachers, faithle≈ø≈øe teachers, wooe for
them≈øelves, in≈øtead of their Lord: the people,
fooli≈øh people, fall in love with the man, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtead
of the ma≈øter, the ≈øervant, in≈øtead of the
≈øoveraigne: And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> in≈øtructs them
both: the teachers, what they ≈øhould do, from
the 14. of the 1. to the 5. of the 3. where im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
an occa≈øion, he ≈øweetly pa≈ø≈øes to the
people, what they ≈øhould doe: the people
mu≈øt not account too highly of their Mini≈øters,
for two rea≈øons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:220:67"/>
1. They are but the <hi>Lords ≈øervants.</hi> They
may well take up the embleme of a watering-Pot
dropping, with this word, <hi>Nil mihi praete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,
praeterea mihi nil. For Paul may plant, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo
may water, but it is the Lord that gives the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe.</hi>
And therefore they mu≈øt not ≈øet up the
labourer again≈øt the Lord.</p>
               <p>Nay ≈øecondly, the Mini≈øters, they are the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi>
≈øervants in the Lord, <hi>For all things are
yours, whether Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, or the world
or life, or death, or things pre≈øent, or things to come,
all are yours, and ye are Chri≈øts, and Chri≈øt is Gods.</hi>
And therefore, you mu≈øt not make them lords
of your faith: and therefore, <hi>Let no man glory in
men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the Mini≈øters duty. It is not to
≈øeeke them≈øelves, but the glory of God, and
the good of the people; and therefore, not to
preach them≈øelves in quaint words, and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
eloquence, but to preach both for <hi>matter,
Christ Ie≈øus;</hi> and for <hi>manner, with all plainne≈ø≈øe,</hi>
and without all affectation, nothing but <hi>Chri≈øt
Ie≈øus</hi> with all humility, and without all o≈øten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
nothing but <hi>Chri≈øt Ie≈øus crucified. Chri≈øt
Ie≈øus,</hi> mu≈øt be the argument of their preaching,
for in him God will be glorified: <hi>Chri≈øt Ie≈øus</hi>
mu≈øt be the ornament of their preaching, that
<hi>he that glorieth may glory in the Lord.</hi> This is
the Summe of that which is laid downe at
length in <hi>Pauls</hi> example: his ≈øtory reports both
the fact that he did ≈øo, and the cau≈øes, both ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficients,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:220:68"/>
and ends: efficients, <hi>God</hi> peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commanding, <hi>Paul</hi> voluntarily obeying <hi>God</hi>
as a royall Soveraigne, <hi>Paul</hi> as a loyall ≈øubject,
<hi>God imperio, Paul ob≈øequio;</hi> both which have
their ends the ≈øame, to wit, the glory of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
God, and the eternall good of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians:</hi>
yet with this different di≈øtinction,
<hi>God</hi> independently, <hi>Paul</hi> in dependency; <hi>God</hi>
as ≈øupreme head pre≈øcribing, <hi>Paul</hi> as ≈øubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
≈øub≈øcribing to his holy plea≈øure: and with
this di≈øpo≈øition <hi>God</hi> intending his glory, is ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
treated of in the fir≈øt Chapter, <hi>Paul</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
the peoples good, ≈øpecially propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in this Chapter. This is the <hi>≈øeries rei,</hi> but
the <hi>≈øeries hi≈øtoriae</hi> con≈øi≈øts in three ≈øteps.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>God</hi> commanded <hi>Paul,</hi> and all, ≈øo to do,
from the 17. ver≈øe of the 1. to the end.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Paul</hi> determined ≈øo to doe, in the ver≈øe
of my Text.</p>
               <p>3. He did ≈øo, in the fir≈øt ver≈øe, for thus they
lie in order: and therefore you mu≈øt ob≈øerve
two things for the method.</p>
               <p>1. That the fir≈øt ver≈øe of this Chapter
holds hands with the 17. of the 1. and all
which is in≈øerted, is but a commoration in
the ≈øtorie, illu≈øtrating the command of God
from the cau≈øe of his coun≈øell, and the contrary
conceit of the worldlings.</p>
               <p>2. That the order of the two latter parts in
his determination and action inverted, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
placed after the 1. ver≈øe, which in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:220:68"/>
method, ≈øhould have had the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie.</p>
               <p>To contract all that hath beene ≈øaid: two
things may be ob≈øerved here, a <hi>Precept,</hi> and an
<hi>Example.</hi> The Precept is a de≈øcription of a
Mini≈øter of the Go≈øpell, to be ≈øuch an one, as
now being ≈øent of God, is to preach the glad
tydings of <hi>Chri≈øt Ie≈øus</hi> come into the World,
for the redemption of mankinde, for the glory
of God, and the ≈øalvation of his people: This
de≈øcription containes the chiefe cau≈øes, as is
≈øhewed. The example is <hi>Paul,</hi> in whom, as
in a gla≈ø≈øe, all this is repre≈øented, for three
Rea≈øons.</p>
               <p>1. For <hi>Pauls own ≈øake,</hi> to vindicate his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie
with the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> inveigled with
their Rabbinicall Doctors, and thence offended
with <hi>Pauls</hi> ≈øimplicitie, began to call in que≈øtion:
as you may ≈øee.</p>
               <p>2. For the <hi>Doctors ≈øake,</hi> that if they would
not learne their duty from God, they might
learne it from him, ≈øo lofty a patterne, of ≈øo
lowly a pietie: as you may ≈øee.</p>
               <p>3. For the <hi>Corinthians ≈øake,</hi> to provoke them
to a filiall imitation, by the patriall example of
his humilitie.</p>
               <p>To draw now to a conclu≈øion. You ≈øee the
<hi>context</hi> is a Commentary upon the <hi>Text:</hi> and
the <hi>Text</hi> is a Compendium of the <hi>context;</hi> for
the Text is a recapitulation of all the ≈øeveralls

The meaning then is, as if <hi>Paul</hi> had ≈øaid, <hi>I
thought nothing worthy to be knowne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
determined to make ≈øhew of no other knowledg

               </p>
               <p>This being the meaning, you ≈øee what this
ver≈øe containes in it, namely, a generall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
and a ≈øpeciall example, a generall precept
in a ≈øpeciall example. <hi>The generall precept</hi> is,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:220:69"/>
that every Mini≈øter mu≈øt preach, for matter,
<hi>Chri≈øt Ie≈øus</hi> only; for manner, with all humility
<hi>Chri≈øt Ie≈øus</hi> crucified: this is in the Text, and
the context, as a Commentary, ≈øhews why this
mu≈øt be done, from the efficients.</p>
               <p>1. God he commands.</p>
               <p>2. The Mini≈øter, it is his duty to obey. And
from the ends.</p>
               <p>1. He mu≈øt ≈øeeke Gods glory, not his owne
applau≈øe.</p>
               <p>2. He mu≈øt ≈øeeke the peoples ≈øalvation, not
his owne approbation.</p>
               <p>And ≈øecondly, it ≈øhewes what is here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
all humane wi≈ødome and humane elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
which tend any way to ≈øelfe ≈øeeking,
and, therefore all the≈øe doctrines are plainly
contained in this precept, be≈øide what may be
collected: as.</p>
               <p>1. That the only way to ≈øeeke Gods glory and the
≈øalvation of the people, is by teaching Chri≈øt Ie≈øus,
and him Crucified, and him only: <hi>and therefore,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That we can hardly preach in humane e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence
and wi≈ødome, but we ≈øhall be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of bewraying our owne vainglory, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
the Lords honour, and the ≈øoules of
his people.</p>
               <p>3. The preaching in humility, is the be≈øt
way to prevent Schi≈ømes in charity.</p>
               <p>Now all the≈øe are made more illu≈øtrious
in a mo≈øt illu≈øtrious example, to which every

Crucified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much for the entrance into this

becau≈øe it is the ≈øumme of all Religion,

the ≈øumme of all, the de≈øire of <hi>Paul</hi> here, and
of all Chri≈øtians, and the ≈øumme of my de≈øire:
for I count all things lo≈ø≈øe, for the excellent
knowledge ≈øake of <hi>Christ Ie≈øus</hi> my Lord, for
whom I could ≈øuffer the lo≈ø≈øe of all things, and
do count them but dung, that I may win <hi>Chri≈øt;
For I determined</hi> (and therefore wonder not at

two things out of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and
tho≈øe both of ≈øpeciall con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
1. <hi>Quid docendum:
What is the dutie of every Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
2. Quid di≈øcendum: What
is the duty of every man.</hi> The duty of every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øter
is expre≈øly implyed, in the particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Pauls</hi> determination: the duty of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man is directly deduced by an ea≈øie con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
out of the nature of Relation. For if
the dutie of the teacher be to teach <hi>Christ,</hi> and
nothing but <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> as it appeares in <hi>Paul, who
determined to know nothing, but Chri≈øt Ie≈øus, and
him Crucified:</hi> then the duty of the learner can
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:220:72"/>
be nothing el≈øe, but to <hi>learne to know Chri≈øt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus
and him crucified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Mini≈øters duty is more naturall to the
≈øcope of the Text: the duty of every man is
more generall in the order of nature; ≈øo that
they may both challenge and ≈øtrive for the
precedency. Therefore I determined to take
an indifferent cour≈øe: The la≈øt time I handled
the former, ≈øo farre as it made for the clearing
of the Text, but de≈øcended not to any ≈øpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
wherein I pointed only what was the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the Mini≈øter, generally out of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,
particularly in the words.</p>
               <p>And lea≈øt any man ≈øhould object, that <hi>Paul</hi>
indeed did thus, but we are not pinned to his
≈øleeve, we live not by examples, <hi>&amp; nos habemus
Spiritum Sanctum,</hi> I ≈øhewed how his example
did conteine, not only a <hi>precept</hi> concerning the
argument of preaching, but al≈øo an argument
to provoke us to the ob≈øervation of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.
For it was,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was brought up at <hi>Gamaliels</hi>
feet, <hi>rapt up into the third heaven,</hi> taken for a
<hi>god at Ly≈øtra,</hi> even <hi>Mercurie</hi> the god of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
if <hi>Paul</hi> then be exemplified for this
humble vaine of preaching, who then is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted?</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Paul</hi> did it not out of <hi>rudene≈ø≈øe,</hi> or <hi>ra≈øhne≈ø≈øe,</hi>
but he <hi>deliberated</hi> what was be≈øt to be done, and
<hi>determined of this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. He <hi>determined not ≈øo much as to know,</hi> as if
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:220:73"/>
he ≈øhould ≈øay, <hi>deleo dehinc ex animo omnes,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>4. Not to know <hi>any thing,</hi> not a <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>5. Not any thing, no, not among the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi>
among you, rich, learned <hi>Graecians,
Corinthians.</hi> All which inferre, or rather inforce
this conclu≈øion.</p>
               <p>That if Paul upon the≈øe termes would not, then
no Mini≈øter, upon any termes must preach any
thing, but Chri≈øt Ie≈øus, and him crucified.</p>
               <p>And thus much I thought good to premi≈øe
concerning the fir≈øt, <hi>Quid docendum,</hi> what is the
duty of every Mini≈øter, becau≈øe it ≈øeemes to be
≈øomthing more ≈øpecially intended in the ver≈øe:
now I come to the ≈øecond.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quid di≈øcendum, What is the duty of every
man,</hi> which I will pro≈øecute, becau≈øe it is more
generally extended in u≈øe: or rather I come to
the Doctrine which is common to both, and
out of which both of them are derived. The
Doctrine is this.</p>
               <p>That the knowledge of Chri≈øt Ie≈øus crucified, is
≈øufficient to ≈øalvation.</p>
               <p>Which in a word ju≈øtifies both <hi>Pauls</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
as a rea≈øon, and warrants <hi>Calvins</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervation,
for the duty both of Preacher and
People, as a ground and foundation: therefore
≈øeeing the whole frame of this building lies
upon it, it will not be ami≈ø≈øe to take a ≈øpeciall
view of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:220:73"/>
The ri≈øe of this Doctrine out of the≈øe words
is evident: for if <hi>Paul</hi> who was ≈øent by God to
preach ≈øalvation to tho≈øe that believe, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to preach nothing among them but <hi>Ie≈øus
Chri≈øt</hi> and him crucified, then either that was
≈øufficient to that end, or els it mu≈øt needs be, that
he either <hi>weakly conceived</hi> of the means, and ≈øo
was <hi>unskilfull;</hi> or <hi>wilfully concealed</hi> ≈øome part of
them, and ≈øo was <hi>unfaithfull</hi> in his office; but
it were bla≈øphemy to ≈øay ≈øo; for, as for his fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe
he was not inferiour to the greate≈øt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles;
and as for his fidelitie, <hi>he revealed to them
the whole will of God:</hi> and this very place, (≈øo
eminent it was) propounds him as an exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
patterne: and therefore I thinke it is firme
out of this place, <hi>That the knowledge of Chri≈øt
Ie≈øus crucified is ≈øufficient to ≈øalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that we may the more di≈øtinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of this truth, I will endeavour to cleare
the≈øe two things.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That</hi> Chri≈øt Ie≈øus is a ≈øufficient Saviour.</p>
               <p>2. That <hi>faith</hi> (for this I under≈øtand here
by knowledge) <hi>is ≈øufficient to make him our
Saviour:</hi> For the≈øe two things mu≈øt con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in our ≈øalvation, the <hi>appretiation,</hi> (that I
may ≈øo ≈øpeak) and the <hi>appropriation,</hi> the <hi>gift,</hi> and
the <hi>conveyance,</hi> and both the≈øe are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in that propo≈øition: for, <hi>Christ</hi> crucified is
the price paid, which is made ours by faith,
when his ≈øpirit enlightening our minds to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
his mercy, and inclining our wils to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:220:74"/>
imbrace it, unites us to our Saviour: and if
there be any defect in the ≈øufficiencie, it mu≈øt
needs be, either becau≈øe <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> is not a ≈øuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Saviour, or, becau≈øe faith is not ≈øufficient
to make him our Saviour: but neither of the≈øe
can be.</p>
               <p>1. For the fir≈øt, <hi>That Chri≈øt is a ≈øufficient Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour:</hi>
I will fir≈øt point out what Salvation is:
and ≈øecondly, prove that <hi>Christ</hi> hath wrought
it ≈øufficiently.</p>
               <p>1. By <hi>Salvation,</hi> I meane the <hi>Summum bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
the utmo≈øt end, the <hi>chief happine≈øse</hi> of man,
which cannot con≈øi≈øt in any thing in the world,
≈øave in his <hi>conjunction and conformity with his
Creator:</hi> For the Lord made all things for
man, and man for him≈øelfe. Indeed he imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the <hi>ve≈øtigia</hi> of his power, and wi≈ødome,
and all his Attributes, in the glorious worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man≈øhip
of the World; but as for all other
creatures, though they contain the arguments
of his prai≈øe, written in golden Letters, yet
they have no eye to read them, though they
obey the word of his will, for he did but ≈øay,
<hi>let it be ≈øo, and it was ≈øo,</hi> yet it was without a free
and voluntarie obedience; therefore it plea≈øed
God to create man, who might glorifie him in
the <hi>carefull ob≈øervation of his wi≈ødome,</hi> written in
the volume of his workes, and in the chearfull
<hi>ob≈øervance of his will</hi> ingraven in the table of his
heart; and for this cau≈øe was he made, as he
was the <hi>image of God,</hi> in ≈øcience and ≈øanctitie;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:220:74"/>
and on this condition was he made the Lord of
all the creatures, that in their names that could
not, he might that could, offer the tribute of
prai≈øe to his Lord and Maker. And this was
the rea≈øon, that man was the la≈øt of all his
workes, as though all proceeded from him, but
ended in man, and man only ≈øtood betweene
them and God, receiving all the profit of them
with the one hand, and re-delivering all the
prai≈øe of them with the other hand, into the
hands of the Lord. This then was the end of
man, in the ob≈øervation of his wi≈ødome, and
the ob≈øervance of his will to glorifie God, and
this ≈øhould have beene his honour, and his
happine≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you doe not well under≈øtand yet
what I meane by Salvation; neither indeed can
you well under≈øtand it, till you have con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>≈øtate that man now is in:</hi> and therefore I
pray give me leave to touch it briefly.</p>
               <p>I ≈øay then that every man of us, every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
≈øonne is born by nature a ve≈ø≈øell of wrath,
a va≈ø≈øall of Satan, an enemy to God, and all
goodne≈ø≈øe. If you aske me whence this comes,
I an≈øwer as <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> in another ca≈øe, <hi>Ab initio
non fuit ≈øic:</hi> for as I told you before, and now
tell you againe, Man was created the mo≈øt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
piece of this goodly frame, a Citizen of
Heaven, Inhabitant of Paradi≈øe, Brother of the
Angels, Lord of the Creatures, Sonne of the
Almightie, even the glorious image of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:220:75"/>
Lord of glory, the lively picture of the living
God, his body being graced with many orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and his ≈øoule adorned with many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
≈øo that Heaven and Earth might ≈øeeme to
have beene maried in his making.</p>
               <p>Now, then man was no ≈øooner made but he
rebelled again≈øt his maker, he that was right,
was fat and kicked again≈øt his Lord, and we in

               <p>I marvaile I heare no more cry out with

if we cannot adde that which follows, reiterate
the ≈øame againe, and ≈øay? <hi>O mi≈øerable man that I
am, who ≈øhall deliver me from this body of death!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ye ≈øee now the mi≈øery of a naturall man,
con≈øi≈øting in the <hi>con≈øcience of ≈øinne,</hi> and the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence

culpae, malum poenae:</hi> this is the mi≈øerie of man,
which e≈øtranges him farre from the ≈øtate of
happines: and out of this ye may gather what
≈øalvation is. For every Salve ≈øuppo≈øes a Sore,
and the ≈øore is ≈øinne and paine, and therefore
the ≈øalve is that which will free us from this
horrible condition: and re≈øtore, and re-e≈øtate us
into the favour of the Lord, and ≈øo into our
former felicitie. This is that which I meane by
Salvation.</p>
               <p>And thus am I falne into the ≈øecond point,
<hi>That Chri≈øt is a ≈øufficient Saviour.</hi> The Sunne
≈øhines not ≈øo cleare in his ≈øtrength, as this truth
I hope ≈øhall ≈øhine, though through my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe:

for, to let pa≈ø≈øe all that might bee
alleadged for it, and to make u≈øe of tho≈øe
grounds onely, which have beene laid already.
Yet it will be more then evident: for as you
heard, Salvation is the redeeming us from that
mi≈øerable condition, in which by nature we lie
plunged mo≈øt de≈øervedly, and re≈øtoring us to
that happy ≈øtate which we ≈øhould have enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
had we continued in our integrity: But
<hi>Christ Ie≈øus</hi> hath performed both the≈øe for us:
therefore he is a ≈øufficient Saviour. The proofe
of the Propo≈øition was provided for before:
the A≈ø≈øumption I will make good in the parts.
For fir≈øt <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> hath redeemed us from all our
mi≈øery, whether ≈øinne, the roote, or puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the fruit be con≈øidered.</p>
               <p>1. He hath taken away <hi>all ≈øinne,</hi> both our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall
impuritie, by the originall purity of
his manhood, which was therefore ≈øanctified
in his conception, by the worke of the Holy
Gho≈øt, that it might be exempted from the
common condition of corruption; and our
actuall impietie, by the actuall ob≈øervance of
the whole Law of God. The <hi>Phari≈øees</hi> could
not take him tripping in a word, though they
laid many traines to intrap him. The <hi>High
Prie≈øts</hi> could lay nothing to his charge, though
they hired fal≈øe witne≈ø≈øes again≈øt him. <hi>Pilate</hi>
him≈øelfe was con≈øtrained, through the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie
of his cau≈øe, <hi>ceremonially</hi> to ju≈øtifie him
by wa≈øhing his hands, though he were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrained
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:220:76"/>
through the importunitie of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<hi>judicially</hi> to proceed again≈øt him, and ≈øo
≈øpill blood guiltle≈ø≈øe. Thus was <hi>Chri≈øt Ie≈øus
the Lambe without ≈øpot, the I≈øraelite without guile,
fairer then the children of men,</hi> that ≈øo he might
take away the pollution of our nature, with
which we were wholly defiled. And this was
his active obedience, wherein hee did that
which we ≈øhould have done, but could not, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
fulfilling even the rigorous exaction of
all Gods Commandements.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Puni≈øhment of ≈øinne</hi> he tooke away
likewi≈øe by ≈øuffering and overcomming that
which we mu≈øt have ≈øuffered, but could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome,
even the full viols of Gods wrath,
and the weight of his hand, the heavie weight
of his heavie wrath, which was due to us for
our offences: for he tooke not on him <hi>our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
only, but the <hi>infirmities of our nature:</hi> hee
that was <hi>rich</hi> became <hi>poore</hi> for our ≈øakes, that
we which were <hi>poore</hi> might be made <hi>rich:</hi> hee
that was <hi>cloathed with maje≈øtie</hi> as with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
became <hi>naked,</hi> that we might be decked
with the <hi>robes of his righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe:</hi> he that was
<hi>annointed with the oile of gladne≈øse above his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
wept;</hi> that all teares might be wiped
from our eyes: he who≈øe throne was in the
Heavens, wandred and <hi>had not whereon to re≈øt his
head,</hi> that he might lead us, who had lo≈øt our
≈øelves in the Labyrinth of ≈øinne, to eternall re≈øt,
and fix us like ≈øtarres in the Firmament.</p>
               <p>

Doe you believe in him for the≈øe things (as
he once ≈øaid to <hi>Nathaniel</hi>) follow me a little
with your attention, and you ≈øhall ≈øee greater
things then the≈øe: For he tooke upon him the
cha≈øti≈øements of our ≈øinnes, and bare the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of our iniquities: he was <hi>accu≈øed,</hi> that wee
might be <hi>acquitted;</hi> he was <hi>condemned,</hi> that wee
might be <hi>condoned;</hi> he was <hi>accur≈øed,</hi> that wee

might be cro≈ø≈øed out of the booke of accounts,
and we might be accounted holy and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and wholly righteous. <hi>Who now ≈øhall lay

of all the enemies, they were three, like the

he vanqui≈øhed in the grave, even in his owne

≈øufficient to make him our Saviour:</hi> which I will
handle according to my former order, but exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
briefly. 1. What faith is, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the true
≈øence of our own mi≈øery by nature, and ≈øweet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen≈øion
of Gods mercy offered, an humble
denyall of our ≈øelves, and all creatures, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
relying on the mercy of the Lord in <hi>Christ
Ie≈øus:</hi> This may ≈øerve for a weake delineation of
that worthy grace, framed according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of my former principles.</p>
               <p>And that this is ≈øufficient, needs no more proof,
but to point at that which ye have heard already:
for ≈øeeing our Salvation mu≈øt be wrought by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and he that wrought it is <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> what can be
further requi≈øite, then that <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> and his merits
be made ours, which can be done by faith only:
be≈øide which, there can be no other affection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
God and man: for the Spirit of God is
the bond that unites and knits us to <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> by faith:
and faith is the hand that receives the trea≈øure of
<hi>Chri≈øts</hi> merits, that inrich us: and <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> is all our
riches: for being once tran≈øplanted out of the old
<hi>Adam,</hi> and ingrafted into the new, which is <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi>
and made one with him, the Lord cannot chu≈øe
but repute us righteous, through the imputation of
his righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:220:81"/>
Hence it is, that all our ≈øinnes are remitted and
blotted out of the booke of remembrance, and our
≈øelves re-admitted into his favour, and into his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily:
hence it is, that we are adopted to be his
≈øonnes, and adorned with his ≈øonnes holine≈ø≈øe:
hence it is, that the cur≈øe of our ≈øinnes is take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and we have peace with God and all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
the Angels pitch their Tents about us, and
the ≈øtones of the field are in league with us: for it
is written, <hi>He hath given his Angels charge over
us, to pre≈øerve us in all our wayes, lea≈øt at any time
we ≈øhould hurt our foot again≈øt a ≈øtone:</hi> hence it is, that
<hi>the old man, with the lu≈øts of the ≈øame, dye in us, and
decay, and the new man is renewed daily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ≈øoone as we begin to believe in the Lord <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus,</hi>
the ≈øcales fall from our eyes, that we can not
only read in the book of the Scripture, the will of
God, which before, was a booke clo≈øed, a booke
≈øealed up to us, but al≈øo lift up our eyes to Heaven,
and looke into the volumes of eternitie, and read
our names written in the booke of life: The ≈øhac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kels

are enabled, not only to walk in the Lords Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
but al≈øo, <hi>to run the way of his Commandements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though we groane under the burden of
our ≈øinnes, ≈øo long as we live here cloathed with

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:220:81"/>
through his mercy, who hath ≈øo dearely bought
us, and brought us thither: where we ≈øhall enjoy
the ble≈ø≈øed pre≈øence of God, <hi>in who≈øe pre≈øence, there

But all this is made ours by faith only, which enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
us to the merits of <hi>Christ,</hi> who purcha≈øed it

               </p>
               <p>And thus I ≈øee I have taken up my ≈øpeech
where I let it fall the la≈øt time: for if you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
when I ended I ≈øaid a great word, <hi>That faith in

               <p>I feare not that you ≈øhould thinke I make <hi>quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet
ex quolibet,</hi> as Alchymi≈øts they ≈øay can fetch
oyle out of flint, and as the Papi≈øts ≈øay, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is a no≈øe of wax, and make it ≈øo, when they
conclude the <hi>Popes ≈øupremacie</hi> out of <hi>Peters walking
on the waters:</hi> for I ≈øee my Text will warrant me
in what I have ≈øaid: for if <hi>Paul would preach nothing
but Chri≈øt Ie≈øus, and him Crucified,</hi> and yet was to
preach <hi>all that was nece≈ø≈øarie to ≈øalvation,</hi> then que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtionle≈ø≈øe
he judged <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> crucified to bee the
≈øumme of all: be≈øide this evidence that convinced
me, nece≈ø≈øity compelled me to take this cour≈øe:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:220:83"/>
for when I ≈øought for witne≈ø≈øes of that I had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in the Scripture, the whole booke of God
offered it ≈øelfe: and therefore in ≈øuch copious
plentie, I deemed this the mo≈øt compendious path,
to prove that in generall, which otherwi≈øe would
have proved infinite, if I had once minced it into
the particulars.</p>
               <p>Having thus ≈øcoured the way, I come now to
enter upon the point, to ≈øhew, <hi>that faith in Chri≈øt is
the ≈øumme of Divinitie, the ≈øcope of the Scripture:</hi> and
fir≈øt, I will begin with <hi>Divinitie,</hi> becau≈øe the rule
of it being the <hi>Analogie of faith,</hi> will light us in the
≈øearch of the ≈øecrets of the Scripture, and lead us
into the native meaning therof with more facility:
and this I will apply to the double con≈øideration
of Divinitie, both in the <hi>maine ≈øub≈øtance,</hi> which was
alway the ≈øame, and the <hi>mutable circum≈øtances</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
which according to divers times had ≈øome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øitie.</p>
               <p>The maine ≈øub≈øtance of Divinitie was alway
that <hi>Doctrine and Rule</hi> that chalked out the way, in
which man was to walk to eternall ≈øalvation, and
eternall happine≈ø≈øe: which will ea≈øily appeare to
be ≈øummarily compri≈øed in <hi>faith,</hi> if that be true,
which is mo≈øt true, which I have already proved,
that it is ≈øufficient to attaine ≈øalvation: and the ≈øame
will ≈øhine yet more brightly, if we do but lay
downe the ≈øeverals of the art, for this will be the
≈øumme that all will amount to, this will be the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitome
of all, even <hi>Chri≈øt Ie≈øus,</hi> who is the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of faith,</hi> and the <hi>fountaine of all obedience,</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:220:84"/>
which are both, and all the parts of Divinitie.</p>
               <p>Take the≈øe a≈øunder now, and con≈øider them ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally:
That <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> is the foundation of our faith,
I will alledge but one place for it: heare what <hi>Paul</hi>
≈øaith, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 16. Great is the my≈øterie of godlines,
God manife≈øted in the fle≈øh, ju≈øtified in the Spirit, ≈øeene
of Angels, preached of Men, believed in the World,
received into glory.</hi> See here the my≈øterie, the whole
my≈øterie of godline≈ø≈øe, and that a great my≈øterie,
yea, and without controver≈øie, great is the my≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of godline≈ø≈øe; and yet this is all, even <hi>Christ
Ie≈øus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rea≈øon</hi> it ≈øelfe will ≈øub≈øcribe to this Article, and
proove it too: for you know, the object of faith is
God alone, and by it we are united unto him, and
this was the condition of our integritie: our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
were temples of his ble≈ø≈øed Spirit, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
of the Lord was in the ≈øonnes of men: but
now having provoked him to indignation again≈øt
us, by our voluntarie tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, his mind is ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated,
and the ca≈øe is altered: his good Spirit
being grieved, is departed from us, and he frowns
upon us with an angry countenance: neither can
it be otherwi≈øe, for he could not <hi>love</hi> his owne ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice,
if he did not <hi>hate</hi> our iniquitie.</p>
               <p>We may read <hi>our mi≈øery</hi> in <hi>Adams</hi> ≈øtory, who
after his ≈øinne, when he <hi>heard the voyce of the Lord
walking in the Garden, was afraid, and hid him≈øelfe:</hi>
And againe, in the children of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> who hearing
the <hi>terrible thunders, and ≈øeeing the thick fla≈øhes of
lightning, and the mountaine ≈ømoaking, when the Law
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:220:84"/>
was given at Mount Sinai,</hi> in a great fright, came
to <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> and ≈øaid, <hi>Speake thou unto us, and we will
heare, but let not God ≈øpeake to us, lest we die:</hi> and the
rea≈øon of this is, becau≈øe our guiltie con≈øcience
≈øugge≈øts no other conceit of God unto us, but as of
an angry Judge, who is <hi>cloathed with revenge and
terrour, as with a garment, and who≈øe garments are
dyed in blood,</hi> as the Prophet el≈øewhere ≈øpeaketh.

                  </gap>. And the≈øe examples teach us, in
what need we ≈øtand of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> who might
treate of <hi>peace,</hi> and make an <hi>attonement</hi> for us; for
otherwi≈øe, what faith, what confidence can we
have in God, whom ≈øinne hath made our enemie?
Now <hi>Chri≈øt alone is that Mediator:</hi> for hee by his
≈øuffering hath ≈ømooth'd his Fathers brow, having
<hi>≈øatisfied his ju≈øtice:</hi> and be≈øide hath <hi>purcha≈øed</hi> his
Spirit for us, who teacheth us to <hi>call him Abba
Father;</hi> and through <hi>whom we have acce≈ø≈øe with
boldne≈øse to the throne of grace:</hi> therefore he is the
<hi>foundation of our faith,</hi> which was the fir≈øt part of
Divinitie.</p>
               <p>He is (in the ≈øecond place) the <hi>fountaine of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience:</hi>
I will content my ≈øelfe here al≈øo with
one place, looke <hi>Phil. 1. 9 And this I pray</hi> (≈øaith

the 11. againe, <hi>that ye may be fild with all the fruits

and glory of God:</hi> behold here, love in all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and that love in aboundance, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance
yet more and more: behold againe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:220:85"/>
the fruits of righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and all the fruits, and
a fulne≈ø≈øe of all the fruits, and yet all this, and
more, if more may be, by <hi>Ie≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> for he is the
<hi>Tree planted by the rivers of water,</hi> of which the
<hi>P≈øalmist</hi> ≈øpeaketh, who is <hi>tran≈øplanted</hi> out of the old
<hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>ingrafted</hi> into the <hi>new,</hi> which is <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi>
he is the <hi>tree that bringeth forth her fruit in her ≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon:</hi>
for as ≈øoone as we are in him, ingrafted into
his ≈øtocke, watered with his blood, warmed with
his Spirit, who is the <hi>Sunne of righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe,</hi> we are
inabled to bring forth the <hi>fruits of Righteou≈øne≈øse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And well may he challenge this intere≈øt in all
our obedience in a triple right.</p>
               <p>1. Becau≈øe he hath <hi>performed all obedience in his
owne per≈øon,</hi> but in our name, and therefore for us.</p>
               <p>2. Becau≈øe all the <hi>abilitie</hi> we have to performe
any thing, is <hi>his gift,</hi> and the worke of his Spirit
in our hearts: <hi>For of our ≈øelves, as of our ≈øelves, we
can do nothing, but it is he that worketh in us both the
will and the deed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Becau≈øe he <hi>hides the deformities</hi> and <hi>wa≈øhes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the <hi>≈øpots</hi> of our actions, for otherwi≈øe, <hi>all our
righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe is as a menstruous cloth:</hi> he perfects
all our imperfect performances. Survey but all
the parts of obedience, you ≈øhall find this true. In
the ob≈øervation of the Decalogue, it is worth the
ob≈øervation, that this is the preface, <hi>I am the Lord
thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt,
out of the hou≈øe of bondage:</hi> we mu≈øt be let at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
by <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> out of the bondage of <hi>Egypt,</hi> out of
the fetters of ≈øinne and Satan, before we can ≈øet a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:220:85"/>
≈øtep in the way of Gods Commandements. And
for our <hi>prayers,</hi> we need no other Beades, or bed-roll,
<hi>Chri≈øt</hi> is the only Pearle of price in them: it
is his Spirit that kindles the fire of our zeale, that
<hi>teaches us how to pray, for we know not how to pray as
we ought:</hi> and it is him≈øelfe a≈øcending in the flame
of our ardent de≈øires, as he did once in <hi>Manoahs
≈øacrifice,</hi> that makes God ≈ømell a ≈øweet ≈øavour,
which otherwi≈øe, would ≈øtinke in his no≈øthrils,
would be an abomination, and turne to ≈øinne. For
as <hi>Themi≈øtocles</hi> pre≈øented him≈øelfe to the King of

yea, <hi>the Lord will ble≈ø≈øe us,</hi> as <hi>I≈øaac</hi> ≈øaid, <hi>and
we ≈øhall be ble≈ø≈øed:</hi> The Sacrament receiving, is the
la≈øt act of our obedience, which without <hi>Christ</hi> are
but cold and dead carka≈øes of Lions, unprofitable.</p>
               <p>In a word therefore, <hi>Christ</hi> alone is he that adds
<hi>value,</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> to our weake faith; <hi>beautie,</hi> to
our ≈øtained obedience: being the very <hi>foundation</hi>
of our faith, and the <hi>fountaine</hi> of our obedience: as
I have ≈øhewed of each of them <hi>≈øeverally</hi> taken, and
will endeavour to the doe ≈øame of both <hi>joyntly</hi>
con≈øidered.</p>
               <p>If you looke for the proper place of <hi>faith in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:220:86"/>
Christ,</hi> in the <hi>bodie of Divinitie,</hi> you ≈øhall find it
≈øeated in the very center, where it ≈øtands in a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
relation, <hi>of that which goes before,</hi> and that <hi>which
followes after.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which goes before, is the former part of
the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> which all mooves to it: that
which followes after it, is the <hi>Rule of life,</hi> and is all
mooved from it, and all the lines of either meet
in it.</p>
               <p>As it repre≈øents a <hi>Center,</hi> it is the <hi>heart of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</hi>
For, as in the naturall generation, the heart
is fir≈øt articulated, and then the other parts: ≈øo in
our ≈øpirituall regeneration, faith in <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> is fir≈øt
formed, before any other graces; and therefore
<hi>Paul</hi> cals the <hi>Galatians, his Children, of whom he
travelled in birth, till Christ were formed in them:</hi>

               <p>As wee looke upon it in that double relation,
(me thinks) upward and downeward, it expre≈ø≈øes
<hi>Iacobs ladder</hi> which appeared in a vi≈øion, by which
he ≈øaw <hi>Angels a≈øcending, and de≈øcending, and God

of all, is that <hi>≈øcala coeli,</hi> by which we a≈øcend to
God, and de≈øcend to good workes: and <hi>Paul</hi> hath
excellenty de≈øcribed that compari≈øon in a mo≈øt
≈øweet gradation, <hi>Rom. 8. 29. Tho≈øe whom God hath
foreknowne, tho≈øe al≈øo he prede≈øtinated to be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the image of his ≈øonne; whom he prede≈øtinated,
tho≈øe al≈øo he called; whom he calleth, them he ju≈øtifieth;
whom he ju≈øtifieth, tho≈øe al≈øo he glorifieth:</hi> behold a

               <p>1. In their <hi>Sacraments,</hi> their ordinary Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

in Circumci≈øion, and <hi>≈øprinkled</hi> on their doore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øts
in the Pa≈ø≈øeover, but the <hi>blood of Christ, ≈øhed
for the remi≈øsion of ≈øinnes,</hi> and <hi>≈øprinkled in our</hi> hearts,
to <hi>purge and clean≈øe</hi> all our iniquities: for <hi>Chri≈øt</hi>
was the true <hi>Pa≈øchall Lambe,</hi> in whom therefore
the law of it was fulfilled,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 29</note> 
                  <hi>Not a bone of him ≈øhall
be broken:</hi> and of whom <hi>Iohn</hi> ≈øayes, <hi>Behold the
Lambe of God that taketh away the ≈øinnes of the world.
Chri≈øt</hi> is the Lambe ≈ølaine from the beginning of
the World for that purpo≈øe, and the very name of
<hi>Pa≈ø≈øeover</hi> notes as much: for in <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> it plea≈øed
God, when he judges all the World, in <hi>mercy</hi> to

when hee had celebrated the Pa≈ø≈øover with
his Di≈øciples, in≈øtituted the <hi>Sacrament of his body

the <hi>Lambe</hi> was but a repre≈øentation. And in that

they mu≈øt eat it with <hi>≈øowre hearbs,</hi> to wit, <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
and <hi>mortification,</hi> that they may the better
ta≈øte the ≈øweet mercy of God, in their delivery
from the bondage of ≈øinne and Sathan, ≈øhadowed
out in the bondage of Egypt: ≈øo it is unto us a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
<hi>of our union to Chri≈øt our head:</hi> then they
were to eate it with ≈øweet unleavened bread,
that they might bee taught to take heed of the

of communion with Saints, the bodie of
<hi>Chri≈øt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The difference betweene ours and theirs is,

prayers in or toward the Temple, becau≈øe all
were ≈øanctified and accepted in <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> who was
the true Temple, for ≈øo he ≈øayes of his body, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy
this temple, and I will rai≈øe it againe in three

the world, <hi>the true light which enlightneth all men
that come into the world,</hi> all the≈øe ≈øhadows vani≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at his pre≈øence and fled away.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Leviticall Mini≈øterie</hi> cea≈øed, as you may ≈øee
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:220:91"/>
in a ≈øweet allu≈øion which ≈øome have ob≈øerved:
When God promi≈øed <hi>Iohn Bapti≈øt</hi> to <hi>Zachary,</hi> as
he was di≈øcharging his office in his cour≈øe, <hi>he was
≈øtricken dumbe,</hi> and therefore; when the people ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
he ≈øhould have ble≈ø≈øed them, he could not
≈øpeake, <hi>tacuit Zacharias generaturus vocem,</hi> ≈øaith
one: this ≈øilence proclaimed that that ≈øervice was
at an end: the ≈øilence of a Leviticall Prie≈øt, made
way for the voice of an Evangelicall Preacher, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>Iohn,</hi> who was a <hi>voice preparing the way of the
Lord Ie≈øus,</hi> the only High Prie≈øt of our ≈øalvation.</p>
               <p>You have heard that the <hi>Heathen Oracles</hi> cea≈øed
at the birth of <hi>Chri≈øt;</hi> ≈øo did the <hi>Iewi≈øh Oracles</hi> too,
before his birth, for they had no an≈øwer from
God by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> all the time of
the ≈øecond Temple, and ≈øo you ≈øee that the <hi>Iewi≈øh
Prie≈øthood</hi> cea≈øed too: and at the death of <hi>Chri≈øt,
the vaile of the Temple rent in≈øunder: Theophylact</hi>
hath a witty conceit, a pretty glo≈ø≈øe, that the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
rent her vaile, hearing of the bla≈øphemies of
the <hi>Iewes</hi> uttered again≈øt <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> according to the
fa≈øhion of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who rent their garments when
they heare any bla≈øphemies: but this was the
meaning ≈øurely, to ≈øhew that by the rents of his
body the true Temple, the <hi>way</hi> was opened to all
the faithfull into the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> the highe≈øt
Heavens.</p>
               <p>And no marvaile it is, that <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> upon the
cro≈ø≈øe ≈øhould cau≈øe all ≈øhadowes to vani≈øh: the T
(which men make the figure of the Cro≈ø≈øe) in
the Egyptian my≈øteries, is an Hieroglyphick of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:220:92"/>
eternall life, which (≈øay they) when it comes,
≈øhall put an end to our Religion. It may be they
had ≈øome notion of ≈øuch a thing from the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
or rather it is an after-birth: but this is certaine,
that <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> lifted up upon the Cro≈ø≈øe was in his
Meridian exaltation, no marvaile then, if the ≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
vani≈øhed.</p>
               <p>We reade of one that wondred how his Ho≈øt
had furni≈øhed his table with ≈øo rare variety, his
Ho≈øt an≈øwered, that all was but Swines fle≈øh, only
the art of the Cooke had made the difference:
and I according to my abilitie have di≈øcovered,
that all the di≈øhes of the old Ceremonies, furni≈øh
us with no other thing but <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> only the wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the Lord diver≈øly dre≈ø≈øed his ≈øons fle≈øh,
in proportion to the times, and palats of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
in ≈øuch admirable variety.</p>
               <p>Come we now to the la≈øt period of times, the
<hi>time of the Go≈øpell,</hi> and ≈øee the mu≈øicall harmony
thereof with the former: wherein me thinks, I
pre≈øage already, that my talke will be more ea≈øie:
for what meanes the departure of all the Legall
≈øhadowes, at the approach of <hi>Christ;</hi> if he were
not the ≈øub≈øtance of all: and therefore the aboliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of tho≈øe is a cleare evidence, that <hi>Chri≈øt now is
all in all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Doctrine preached every where, is a ≈øilver
Trumpet of this ≈øacred truth: but that having
beene alway the ≈øame, my cour≈øe propounded,
permits me not to in≈øi≈øt upon it: only this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
it hath, that as it pointed forward before to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:220:92"/>
                  <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> to come, ≈øo now it pointeth backward to
<hi>Chri≈øt</hi> come, in whom it teacheth every man to
looke for ≈øalvation, and no other: the outward
≈øignes that are left are few, but they con≈øpire in the
≈øame te≈øtimonie with the Doctrine, and the old
ceremonies, ≈øealing the ≈øame thing, but with more
≈øimplicity, and with more ≈øignificancie.</p>
               <p>The <hi>water of Bapti≈øme</hi> hath a ≈øutable Analogie
with the blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> by which we are purged
from our ≈øpirituall uncleanne≈ø≈øe of ≈øinne, as we are
purged by water from all corporall uncleanne≈ø≈øe.
<hi>In the Lords Supper</hi> we have bread and wine, meat
and drinke perfect nouri≈øhment: bread the ≈øtaffe
of mans life, and wine that maketh glad the heart
of man, the be≈øt <hi>elements</hi> to expre≈ø≈øe the be≈øt <hi>ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi>
which how fully doe they ≈øet forth <hi>Chri≈øt</hi>
Crucified: the Bread is broken, ≈øo was his body
broken; the Wine is powred forth, ≈øo was his
blood powred forth upon the Cro≈ø≈øe, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion
of ≈øinnes, to all tho≈øe that come to him
with an hunger and thir≈øt after his righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe,
and feed on him by a lively faith.</p>
               <p>The ≈øignification is ≈øo emphaticall, that I may
≈øay of tho≈øe that are partakers of this, as <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaid
of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who had heard him preach
<hi>Christ</hi> crucified,<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>before who≈øe eyes Christ cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

they bee fooli≈øh <hi>Galatians,</hi> and except they bee

               <p>And thus I conclude this point, That <hi>Chri≈øt

               <p>And thus you ≈øee, I have overtaken, or rather,
met with the ≈øame point, and in the ≈øame place
where I left it the la≈øt time: for, as you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
after I had treated of the ≈øufficiency of

was the <hi>≈øumme of Divinitie,</hi> and the <hi>≈øcope of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:</hi>
that it was the ≈øumme of Divinitie, as I
could, I then evinced, by ca≈øting up the reckoning
of both the parts thereof, faith, and obedience,
which amounted to no more but this: for wee

of his fle≈øh, <hi>to fulfill all righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe.</hi> And perhaps
the 19. <hi>P≈øalme</hi> may have ≈øome relation to this

               <p>Now both the≈øe were the <hi>≈øame light,</hi> for the
Moone receives hers from the Sunne, and the

is but idle, but the conclu≈øion is infallible,

               <p>And thus many God would have for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of our Faith, that in the mouth of two or

<hi>Prophets, Evangeli≈øts, Apo≈øtles,</hi> the truth of the
word, the word of truth ≈øhall ≈øtand a≈ø≈øured: yet

the ointment, but this was not it: here was the

of ≈øinnes:</hi> the place is very plaine, and tho≈øe
words of the Prophets are thri≈øe repeated in the

all in a mo≈øt cele≈øtiall harmony; two of which,

and two, the two <hi>Evangeli≈øts Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi>
witne≈ø≈øes of that which they wrote, that all
pretext of doubting might be excluded.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Acts</hi> have nothing but the ≈øame <hi>Chri≈øt</hi>
preached among the Gentiles, for he brake downe
the wall of ≈øeparation. And as after the flood, there
was a confu≈øion of tongues, to hinder the building
of <hi>Babel:</hi> ≈øo was there the <hi>effu≈øion of the gift of
tongues,</hi> to further the <hi>building of the heavenly Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øalem,</hi>
that all knees might bow, and all tongues
confe≈ø≈øe that <hi>Ie≈øus</hi> is the Lord.</p>
               <p>All the <hi>Epi≈øtles</hi> have no other argument but <hi>≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
by Chri≈øt,</hi> as may appeare out of the ≈øalutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Grace and peace in Chri≈øt Ie≈øus, grace</hi> the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and <hi>peace</hi> the perfection of all happine≈ø≈øe, and
both by <hi>Chri≈øt Ie≈øus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is ob≈øerved, that the very name of <hi>Ie≈øus</hi> is
u≈øed by <hi>Paul</hi> alone, above five hundred times: and
no wonder, for there be in it a thou≈øand trea≈øures,
as <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtome</hi> ≈øaid, yea all the <hi>trea≈øures of wi≈ødome
and knowledge</hi> and comfort, are hid and lockt up in
him: The whole <hi>Revelation</hi> what is it but a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitorie
for the ob≈øervation of the government
of the Church by <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> the King thereof, and the
expectation of his glorious comming, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion
of all evidences, <hi>Come Lord Ie≈øus, come

                  <q>
                     <l>Tanquam habeat ≈øcriptum tota tabella, veni.</l>
                  </q>
That I may didicate an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Jewell to the ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Tabernacle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:220:103"/>
And thus I ≈øhut up this part, that <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> is the
≈øumme of both <hi>Old and New Te≈øtament:</hi> in the≈øe
three differences, as to come in the Old, and in the
New as come, and to come againe to judgement.</p>
               <p>And me thinks, tho≈øe two are like the two <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims,</hi>
that ≈øhadowed one Mercy-≈øeat, their faces
were one toward another, and their wings; but
both toward <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> the Mercy-≈øeat: like <hi>Ezekiels
vi≈øion,</hi> where the foure creatures ≈øtirred and ≈øtood
≈øtill both together: who≈øe wheels were, as it were,
one wheele within another, and <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> in all: like
the Spies, that returned to <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> out of <hi>Canaan:</hi>
for as they brought the clu≈øters of Grapes (a map
of that good Land) betweene them, ≈øo the two
Te≈øtaments bring nothing but <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> betweene
them: now <hi>Chri≈øt is the true Vine,</hi> as him≈øelf ≈øayes,
like the <hi>clu≈øters of Grapes,</hi> as the <hi>Spou≈øe</hi> ≈øpeaks: and
his blood is the Wine of the Sacrament, the wine
that maketh glad the heart of the faithfull, which
was ≈øcruzed out of his body upon the Cro≈ø≈øe, the
<hi>Winepre≈øse of Gods wrath;</hi> where you may behold
him excellently, <hi>tanquam uva pa≈ø≈øa, Christ Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> is like the hinges, upon
which the whole frame of time, upon which the
<hi>bifores valvae</hi> of the hou≈øe of the Sunne, the two
Tabernacles, the two gates of Heaven, doe hang
and turne them≈øelves.</p>
               <p>And now I hope, though this my di≈øcour≈øe bee
very imperfect, yet it will not bee altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
or unprofitable: for this one point, that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:220:103"/>
                  <hi>faith in Chri≈øt crucified is the ≈øumm of al the Scripture,</hi>
well con≈øidered, mu≈øt needs give very much light
to the reading of every part thereof: it will be like
a key, to unlock the meaning, and ≈øo make way to
the rich trea≈øure therein, like a clue of thread, to
lead us thorow many intricate Labyrinths therof.
And this makes me call to mind, what I forgat e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
now, that the <hi>red thread that Rahab</hi> hung out of
her window, when <hi>Iericho</hi> was be≈øeiged, was an
Embleme of <hi>Chri≈øt Crucified,</hi> by whom all the
faithfull mu≈øt be ≈øaved from eternall death, as ≈øhe
was then pre≈øerved from pre≈øent de≈øtruction:
much bettet then <hi>Leucotheae vitta,</hi> or <hi>Ariadnes
filum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let me wind up all that hath beene ≈øaid, <hi>Chri≈øt
is the ≈øumme of all Divinity:</hi> me thinks the <hi>Clypeus
fidei,</hi> is like that <hi>Clypeus Phidiae,</hi> the <hi>Buckler of faith</hi>
like the buckler of <hi>Phidias,</hi> that Hi≈øtorians ≈øpeake
of, I meane the Buckler of <hi>Minerva,</hi> which <hi>Phidias</hi>
made: for as in it he had ≈øo curiou≈øly intrailed his
owne name, that it could not be taken out without
the di≈ø≈øolution of the whole frame; ≈øo hath <hi>Chri≈øt</hi>
≈øo divinely wrought his <hi>name</hi> in the worke of ≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
the rule of Divinitie, that it cannot be taken
out, but that golden chaine, that <hi>≈øeries cau≈øarum,</hi>
will all fall in ≈øunder.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ephe≈øians,</hi> when <hi>Croe≈øus</hi> be≈øeiged them,
chained their City to the <hi>Temple of Diana,</hi> the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
theirs, when <hi>Alexander,</hi> to the Statue of
<hi>Hercules:</hi> and ≈øo all the precepts of Divinitie ≈øeem
to be chained to the Cro≈ø≈øe of <hi>Chri≈øt:</hi> he is the <hi>um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilicus,</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:220:104"/>
where all the intrails are knit together, the
Center, where all lines meet: and therefore in the
<hi>Creed</hi> of twelve Articles, ten of them concern him,
and be≈øide the other two of God the Father, and
the Holy Gho≈øt, have their dependance on him
too, for he hath obtained the Spirit for us, and by
<hi>him we have acce≈øse unto the Father,</hi> as I ≈øhewed
before.</p>
               <p>And therefore as in the fir≈øt book we learn, the
Cro≈ø≈øe begins the row, as though all the 24. Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were but Commentaries upon the Cro≈ø≈øe: ≈øo
≈øurely, this is the ≈øumm of all our learning, to learn
to know <hi>Chri≈øt Ie≈øus</hi> and him Crucified.</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>Chri≈øt is the Scope of all the Scriptures,</hi>
Me thinks, the Scripture is a Ring of Gold, which
<hi>Chri≈øt</hi> hath given his Spou≈øe the Church, as a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

not to be <hi>invocated</hi> as <hi>Saviours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That <hi>Sinners cannot be their owne Saviours;</hi>
and therefore, that our <hi>works</hi> on earth, are not <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>
of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Out of the ≈øecond, two things.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That</hi> the Scripture is mo≈øt perfect, <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
needeth not to be patched up with Tradition.</p>
               <p>2. That <hi>the Scriptures are per≈øpicuous,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
neede not to be <hi>locked up from the Laitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the third, two things.</p>
               <p>1. How <hi>a man may know the true Religion,</hi> by
<hi>Chri≈øt</hi> the corner-≈øtone, the <hi>Lydius lapis,</hi> the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtone
of Religion.</p>
               <p>2. How a man may unmaske Antichri≈øt, and
his counterfeit Religion, by <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> and his.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:220:106"/>
2. For <hi>Exhortation,</hi> out of all jointly.</p>
               <p>1. For <hi>Mini≈øters,</hi> what is the true Rule of
Preaching, the Art, (and that I may ≈øo ≈øpeak with
reverence) the very tricke of Preaching, <hi>viz.</hi> to
<hi>Preach Chri≈øt, and him crucified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. For all, what ≈øhould be all our chiefe ≈øtudy,
the aime and ≈øcope of all our ≈øtudies, <hi>viz.</hi> only to
know, believe, and love <hi>Chri≈øt Crucified.</hi> If any of
you think any of the≈øe too farre fet, rather haled
then drawn out of this Text, when I come to the
particulars, I hope to give him a rea≈øonable ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
               <p>And thus I have drawne a Map of the holy
Land: or rather as God brought <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> to the
top of Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> where he ≈øhewed him a ≈øight,
a <hi>Synop≈øis</hi> of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ≈øo have I you:
but as it was then, ≈øo it is now, and ≈øo it will ever
be, we mu≈øt travaile ≈øome dayes journies, before
we can enter into that good Land: we mu≈øt winn
it, and weare it, we mu≈øt fight with the enemies
of God, before we can fill our ≈øelves of the milke
and honey, of that Land which flowed with milke
and honey.</p>
               <p>Thus much I think I may be bold to ≈øay in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
that he that is indifferent, if he thinke advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øedly
on the matter, will ≈øay, that I have taken an
indifferent cour≈øe: I have taken the≈øe to try my
≈øelfe, but I have refu≈øed more which I might have
taken, becau≈øe I would not tire my auditors: I
have ≈øelected the≈øe to exerci≈øe my meditations, out
of many other which I neglected, that I might
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:220:107"/>
not exceed the proportion of this exerci≈øe: for
who ≈øees not that <hi>Antichri≈øtiani≈øme</hi> is nothing
el≈øe but an <hi>oppo≈øition in a my≈øterie,</hi> to the my≈øterie of
<hi>godline≈ø≈øe</hi> revealed in <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> either by open op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning,
or ≈øecret undermining: or if there be any
that cannot ≈øee, he may well heare the Proverb,
<hi>Who is ≈øo blind, as he that will not ≈øee:</hi> ≈øo that if I had
a minde to favour my ≈øelfe, I have a faire occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to make choi≈øe of mine enemie, among all the
troopes of the Romi≈øh Antichri≈øt, and ≈øingle out
the weake≈øt: but I rather follow the direction of
the lot that is falne into my lap, and ≈øet upon him
that ≈øtands neare≈øt, though he ≈øtrout wide, and
≈øpeake boi≈øtrous, and looke big with horrour and
di≈ødainfulne≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>I remember, how <hi>David</hi> with a little ≈øtone
which he found by the brook, branded that proud
<hi>Goliah</hi> in the forehead, and foundred the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumci≈øed
<hi>Philistim,</hi> that defied the Hoa≈øt of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi>
and the Lord of Hoa≈øts. And <hi>Daniel</hi> makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a ≈øtone that was cut out of the mountaine
without hands, which brake the glorious image
of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who≈øe head was of gold, the
armes and brea≈øts of ≈øilver, the thighs and legs of
bra≈ø≈øe, the feet of iron, (a man would think all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall)
and yet that little ≈øtone battered it all to pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Behold, I ≈øtand by the brooke of water, by
the book of God, for the <hi>Scripture is the river, that
makes glad the City of God:</hi> behold in the≈øe chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtall
≈øtreames, the ≈øtone, the <hi>Lord Chri≈øt,</hi> for <hi>Christ
is the ≈øtone</hi> which the proud builders of <hi>Babel</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øed,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:220:107"/>
but is become the head of the corner, which
the <hi>Ma≈øter-builder</hi> hath put in <hi>Sion,</hi> and <hi>elect and
precious ≈øtone:</hi> me thinks I want nothing but <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
hand, or <hi>Davids</hi> ≈øling, to check the ≈øcornefull
Whore with a blow, and ≈øpoile the <hi>mysterie</hi> that is
written in her forehead: and yet againe me thinks
I need not <hi>Davids</hi> hand, ≈øince I have his ≈øtone: for
his ≈øtone is the ≈øame, that <hi>Daniels ≈øtone, and Daniels
≈øtone</hi> (like the <hi>Phoenician</hi> ≈øhips in <hi>Homer</hi>) is guided
by an higher Intelligence, and can doe the feat
without hands: and as the ≈øtone without hands
intimates, according to our interpreters, the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie
of <hi>Mary,</hi> out of whom <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> was hewen,
without the help of man: ≈øo <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> in my Text,
may be taken out without hands, without any
great paines of man, to breake the clay feet, the
brittle pillars of that bra≈øen-faced Whore, to
breake them like a Potters ve≈ø≈øell. And though I
know the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councels,</hi> like <hi>Sauls Armour,</hi>
are not needfull for <hi>David</hi> in his combate: yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it were no hard matter for the happy cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,
when he hath foyled his enemy with a ≈øtone
out of the Scripture, and laid him grovelling in
the du≈øt, to ≈øet his victorious foot upon his necke,
and ≈øtrike off his head with the edge of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as it were with his owne ≈øword, in which he
gloried.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you wonder wher's the point all this
while: is that lo≈øt? is that forgotten? tis true:
but I choo≈øe rather to leade you into my further
di≈øcour≈øe, though with an un≈øea≈øonable preface,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:220:108"/>
then trouble you with an un≈øeemely repetition of
the former: though I might plead the pre≈øcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of time, enough to ≈øecure me from exception or
obloquie: and yet I pre≈øume that, with your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
con≈øtruction, I have erred indeed, but ≈øo
as not <hi>praeter ca≈øam,</hi> no nor <hi>praeter cau≈øam</hi> neither.
I come now to it.</p>
               <p>The fir≈øt point of the Explication was, that
<hi>Christ is a ≈øufficient Saviour:</hi> out of it I deduced,
1. <hi>That Saints are no Saviours,</hi> nor therefore to be
<hi>invocated as Saviours:</hi> here is no ≈øuch magneticall
and invi≈øible Sympathie, that any man ≈øhould
wonder what nece≈ø≈øity tyes the≈øe two together:
neither is their any ≈øuch forced deduction, that a
man ≈øhould need to pumpe or cherne to make it
come: the dependance is ea≈øie<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> as it is in the links of
a chain, draw one, and the re≈øt will follow: as it is
in water ≈øpilt upon an even table, it is very docible
to go which way ≈øoever the finger will lead it; ≈øo
willingly doth this con≈øequent offer it ≈øelf to your
con≈øideration, out of the precedent po≈øition. Well
then, this is our Theme, for this time, that <hi>Saints
are not Saviours,</hi> nor therefore <hi>to be invocated as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours:</hi>
wherein I purpo≈øe fir≈øt to repre≈øent unto
your view a light adumbration, a rude draught of
it, in≈øtead of an expo≈øition of the ≈øtate of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion,
which ≈øhall containe (as it were) a <hi>Sciagraphy</hi>
of the truth, and a <hi>Sciamachy</hi> again≈øt the fal≈øhood:
I ≈øhall mea≈øure but three paces in this porch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I bring you into the maine building, the fir≈øt

in generall:</hi> the la≈øt, in that which particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
the <hi>Virgin Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the fir≈øt: It was ≈øaid of old <hi>Rome,</hi> that it

                  <hi>The Epitomie of a Family, or rather of ≈øupersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

Lord! what a world of trinkets, and tra≈øh, and
trumperie, is their great <hi>Colo≈ø≈øus</hi> ≈øtuffed withall?
what <hi>api≈øh imitation,</hi> what <hi>≈øotti≈øh devotion,</hi> what
<hi>popi≈øh ≈øuper≈øtition</hi> is among them? in≈øomuch that
a man would doubt, whether he ≈øhould laugh, or
≈øcorne, or abhorre tho≈øe fardels of folly; whether
hee ≈øhould laugh at the act, or weep for the actors;
whether he ≈øhould pity their ≈øimplicity, or ≈øpit at
their ≈øinfulne≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>If ever the ≈øaying of the <hi>Preacher</hi> were verified
in ≈øimple truth, <hi>Vanitie of vanities, all is vanitie:</hi>
here it is more then true, and that with advantage,
by a kind of tran≈øcendent ≈øupereminency of truth,
<hi>Vanitie of vanities, all is vanitie:</hi> or if there be any
thing <hi>viler than vanitie,</hi> they ≈øhall vie with it for
vilene≈ø≈øe: or if there be any thing <hi>lighter then va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi>
they ≈øhall weigh with them in the ballance
for lightne≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Egyptian</hi> blindne≈ø≈øe was nothing compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to this; the <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkne≈ø≈øe, not halfe ≈øo
palpable: or if that were more palpable, I am
≈øure, this is more culpable: The <hi>Egyptians</hi> wor≈øhipt
vile creatures, but yet living creatures; the <hi>Romanes</hi>
wor≈øhip ≈øtocks and ≈øtones, and dead carka≈øes: they

wor≈øhip Oxen, and Owles, and Rats, and Mice,

the≈øe wor≈øhip <hi>Iudas</hi> his Lanthorne, <hi>Francis</hi> his

≈øorry Saints I trow: They ≈øute at the Catadupes of

his barbarous language, and (as it were) rockt

better fruits: no marvail then, if they wor≈øhip <hi>Nilus,</hi>
who≈øe ≈øteps dropt to them fatne≈ø≈øe, who≈øe rich in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation

did not preferr the ≈øeat of the ≈øcorners, they might
be preferred to the chaire of <hi>Mo≈øes:</hi> they <hi>≈øit in

and yet they heare no more, then their ≈øtocks and
≈øtones heare them: the dew of Heaven hath rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
falne among them, and yet like <hi>Gideons fleece,</hi>
they are dry, when all the Regions about them

But I pray tell me, what is the ≈øumme of their
devotions, or, if you will heare me, I will tell you
what it is, by my ca≈øting a ≈ømooth-faced ≈ømiling
picture, a Sainti≈øh ≈øtone, a rotten ragg of a na≈øtie
Relique, a B in a box, a Crucifixe I meane, a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
co≈ø≈øet <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> the≈øe are the particulars, now
lay them altogether, and the Summe amounts to
this (if my Arithmetick faile me not) pretty mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,
pretty puppets for ≈øuch wanton babies as
they are to play withall, and as we u≈øe to promi≈øe
children fine gay things of nothing: this is the
≈øumme of their devotion. Behold, the≈øe are thy
gods, √¥ thou ≈øonne of the rebellious woman, √¥
thou daughter of <hi>Rome,</hi> thy gods in which thou
tru≈øte≈øt: this is the precious merchandi≈øe that hath
drawne all the trafique of the World into thy
≈øtreets, the≈øe are the Apples after which thy ≈øoule
lu≈øteth.</p>
               <p>Pardon me, if the≈øe termes ≈øeeme ≈øomething
light: the toyes them≈øelves are ≈øo ridiculous, that
I could not finde in my heart to vouch≈øafe them
any graver ≈øpeech: but I will make amends, and
turn them all away packing: only let me remember
what your worthy Bi≈øhop <hi>Claudius Taurinen≈øis</hi> ≈øaid
excellently of ≈øome of them your <hi>Agnus Deies, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctos
adorant, vivos devorant,</hi> I will make bold to
Engli≈øh it rudely, <hi>they worry the living Saints, while
they wor≈øhip the dead:</hi> but <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> did not ≈øay, <hi>Pinge
Agnos tuos,</hi> frame thee Lambs that may repre≈øent
me, but <hi>Pa≈øce agnos meos, Feed the Lambes</hi> that doe
repre≈øent me: but it ≈øeemes they do not much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:220:110"/>
what hee ≈øaid: and yet he did not only ≈øay
thus, but he conjured them al≈øo with the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
charme of love, if thou love me (<hi>Peter) feed
my Lambs:</hi> and yet the≈øe devout adorers, like <hi>deafe
Adders, ≈øtop their eares and will not heare the charmer,
charme he never ≈øo wi≈øely.</hi> I conclude this point:
As <hi>Ari≈øtippus</hi> once an≈øwered him that asked,
what his ≈øonne ≈øhould be the better for learning, if
he be≈øtowed it on him: <hi>Vt nihil aliud</hi> (≈øaid he) <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t√®
in Theatro non ≈øedebit lapis ≈øuper lapidem:</hi> ≈øo may I
make an≈øwer to him that ≈øhould demand, what
≈øhould any man be the better to <hi>come out of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
out of <hi>Rome,</hi> and betake him≈øelfe into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome
of the faithfull Spou≈øe of <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> our Church,
our Religion: <hi>Vt nihil aliud cert√®, in Templo non ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
lapis ad lapidem,</hi> blocks ≈øhall not pro≈øtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves
before blocks, nor ≈øtones pro≈øtitute
them≈øelves to ≈øtones, living ≈øtones, to livele≈ø≈øe
≈øtones; ≈øen≈øitive blocks, before ≈øen≈øle≈ø≈øe blocks,
be≈øide a thou≈øand priviledges.</p>
               <p>And thus I pa≈ø≈øe to take the ≈øecond ≈øtep, which
was concerning <hi>Saints in generall. Bellarmine</hi> hath
a very tragicall and pa≈ø≈øionate preface to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover≈øie:
hee fals fowle with us Prote≈øtants, hee
termes us ≈øcoffing <hi>Lucians,</hi> and Gyants, that make
warre again≈øt the Gods, and ≈øuch like flowers of
his wild Rhetorick, <hi>Canina facundia,</hi> dogged elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
he be≈øtowes upon us: and perhaps he was
at great co≈øt to gather them, but we conne little
thanks: and then like ≈øome de≈øperate Fencer, that
hath more heart then braine, more malice then
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:220:110"/>
might, he hewes, and la≈øhes, and foynes, and
≈øtrikes blindfold, he cares not where, and hits he
cares not whom: or like ≈øome mad dogg, he hath
a quarrell to every one he meets: he grins at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra≈ømus,</hi>
he ≈ønarles at <hi>Melancthon,</hi> and barkes at <hi>Illy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus,</hi>
and ≈ønatches at <hi>Luther,</hi> and worries <hi>Calvin,</hi>
as though hee had to deale with ≈øome carion car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øe;
this is the only difference, the teeth of a mad
dogg are poi≈øon, but his tongue is no ≈ølander: at
la≈øt, as a man newly awaked out of a trance or
≈øleepe, he throwes his envious eyes to heaven
with great devotion, (for≈øooth) and wonders why
the ≈øtarres are ≈øuffered to ≈øtand there, belike hee
thinks to convince their workes of darkne≈ø≈øe: hee
wonders at the patience of God that ≈øuffers us he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
to di≈øcover their Catholick abominations,
in the fal≈øe wor≈øhip of Saints, and vindicate the
glory of God, from their impudent impo≈øtures.
Me thinks, this preface is like the Painters Table.
One ≈øpake to a Painter to draw him a Hor≈øe run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in full ≈øpeed: he did, and gave it him, but
gave it with the wrong ≈øide upward: the man di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked
it, and told him, he ≈øpake for a runner, this
was a tumbler, no hurt, quoth the Painter, turne
the Table and this will runne: ≈øo in that Preface,
all may be true, but all is turned up≈øide downe;
like the Hor≈øe with his heeles upward, ≈øprawling
toward Heaven: but change the per≈øons, and let
that bee ≈øaid of the Papi≈øts, that hee would faine
make the world believe is true of the Prote≈øtants,
and I blame not the Picture: or as the Painter ≈øaid,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:220:111"/>
turne the Table, and all may runne well enough, or
at lea≈øt go currant. But what if we ≈øhould let the
Je≈øuite goe, perhaps he had as live be ≈øome where
el≈øe, and as live be doing ≈øomething el≈øe, as bee
brought in for a tumbler to play tricks: if you
thinke ≈øo, I am content to di≈ømi≈ø≈øe him: well then,
to leave the Cardinall, and come to the cau≈øe.</p>
               <p>The Papi≈øts have brought in ≈øo many new Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours,
that the true Saviour is gone out: I know
not how they will find Heaven, but I am ≈øure, they
have lo≈øt <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> they have lo≈øt the way to Heaven:
for he is the <hi>way.</hi> And if there be any ≈øpark of faith,
any remnant of the faithfull flocke among them,
they may well complain, as <hi>Mary</hi> did to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener,
when ≈øhe went to vi≈øite the ≈øacred body of
the Lord, and found it not, <hi>Sir, they have taken away
my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him:</hi>
if there be (I ≈øay) any faithfull <hi>Mary</hi> among them,
like <hi>a Lilie among thornes,</hi> which led with an holy
zeale indeed, but mi≈øled by ignorance, ≈øhould
thinke to find him in their crowd of Saints, wrapt
up in ≈øome of their reliques, as he was once in lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin
cloaths, I thinke ≈øome Angell would tell her,
as he did, <hi>He is not here;</hi> I thinke <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> him≈øelfe
would take the paines to meet her, and in≈øtruct her
thus: <hi>Mary,</hi> I ≈øee thou meane≈øt well, but yet thou
mi≈ø≈øe≈øt much, thou art in a right mind, but thou
art in a wrong box: it is but lo≈øt labour to ≈øeeke
<hi>the living among the dead, the living Saviour, among
the dead Saints:</hi> I would have thee know therefore,
I have retired my ≈øelfe from this Garden, and ≈øhall
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:220:111"/>
not feed any more among the≈øe Lillies, <hi>but untill
the day breake and the ≈øhadowes flee away, I go, my wel-beloved,
I go to the mountain of ≈øpices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why do I pre≈øume as it were to teach <hi>Chri≈øt</hi>
to ≈øpeake, who is the <hi>word,</hi> in whom God ≈øpeakes
to us? or why doe I relate his ≈øpeech, who am <hi>a
child and know not how to ≈øpeake?</hi> I know the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
taxe <hi>Homers</hi> ra≈øhne≈ø≈øe, in reporting the ≈øong
of the Sirens, becau≈øe it cannot be thought, how it
≈øhould be done, but it mu≈øt needs fall many bowes
≈øhort of expectation: ≈øuch things are better ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed,
then expre≈ø≈øed; or if expre≈ø≈øed, better
<hi>velo,</hi> then <hi>penicillo;</hi> that veile of ≈øilence is the be≈øt

the Kings map, the word of God in all the≈øe:
there is a <hi>lying ≈øpirit gone out,</hi> and gone into the

               <p>2. They <hi>have made the way wide.</hi> You know

we will thinke, that they thinke at lea≈øt, that they
would come to heaven: But when they heare
<hi>Chri≈øt</hi> ≈øaying, <hi>I am the way,</hi> they thinke in their

him ≈øay plainly, <hi>that the way is narrow,</hi> they ≈øay

the <hi>young man that came to Christ,</hi> went away griev'd
at a like ≈øpeech: ≈øo they are grieved indeed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe
they were as covetous as he was: but they
will not goe away becau≈øe they are not ≈øo ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as hee was. But why was the young man
grieved, and why are they grieved, as the young
man was? becau≈øe he was <hi>rich,</hi> becau≈øe they are
<hi>riotous:</hi> they are afraid that narrow way will not
receive their goodly traine, their great retinue:

that will not ≈øhake hands with that <hi>folly,</hi> that they

away as the young man did? hee was a young
man they thinke, and they are grown gray in mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
devi≈øes: they meane to try conclu≈øions
ere they goe away. What doe they then? they
hire a ra≈øcall rout of hungry ditchers to breake up
the fence, that the word hath made, to make the
way broader then the merits of <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> and then
they eke it out with the forged merits of Saints:
and being ≈øo drunken with ≈øuper≈øtition, that they
cannot pa≈ø≈øe the lake that burnes with fire and

<hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> as they ≈øay the barbarous Turkes doe,
when they meet a deepe river in the way that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupts
their cour≈øe, they ≈ølay their poore va≈ø≈øals,
and make a bridge of their dead corps: ≈øo they
inlarge that bridg with the rotten boords of Saints
mediation: but it is to be feared, that while they,
in their Pontificall fancies imagine the bridge (by
their deceitfull moone-≈øhine) wider then it is, they
find them≈øelves deeper then they would, plunged

               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>They have made the gatewider:</hi> They are ≈øo
cram'd with the ≈øinnes of the people, and fed ≈øo
fat with their <hi>follies,</hi> and ≈øo puft up with the winde

Ma≈øter would faine have the gate ≈øo large, that he

without <hi>vailing his triple crowne,</hi> or bending his

they are no joynts: and like <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
their leggs are of bra≈ø≈øe, they cannot bow, ≈øo
much as to him that made them: they are like
≈øome nice and cold hearers of the word, that are
willing to heare and make toward the Church
(perhaps they made a ≈øhort dinner for ha≈øte) but
when they come there, and ≈øee a little doore be≈øet
with a great throng about it, they ≈øhrinke their
heads into their ≈øhell againe: they meant to heare,
but they never meant to croud for the matter:
the Cat loves fi≈øh, but will not wet her foot: they

twelve Pearles,</hi> every ≈øeverall gate was one Pearle:
the tran≈ølation abates ≈øomething of the worth, for
tho≈øe Pearles in <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> are <hi>Margarites</hi> in <hi>Greek,</hi>

               <p>But here ≈øeemes to be many gates. I pray mark:

               <p>This is the gate which the Angell of God hath

us our gates made of the rotten wood of Saints, if

the≈øe filthy mon≈øters do ≈øo plea≈øe them≈øelves in

of riot.</hi> Like ≈øome fond and amarous bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome
newly wedded, that dotes, may chance,
upon an homely ≈øpou≈øe, and wonders that all his

of their faith: he is ≈øo well acquainted with

it any other) hath ≈øo frozen and congeal'd their

               <p>But the truth is, as I ≈øaid before, we give more
unto the Virgin, that they do: they would have

               <p>And therefore we have taken ≈øuch a cour≈øe

upon them by a generall di≈øcour≈øe, as faithfull
