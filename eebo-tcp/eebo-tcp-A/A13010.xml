            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Purpoſed to have entred into
theſe words abruptly; but the
firſt words which ſtand as it
were in the porch, being parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of ſpeciall inference from
the former, and therefore of
neceſſary reference to them, tell me that I
muſt borrow light at the next doore, that I
may walke inoffenſively. To give a touch
then of the coherence. You may take notice
of it, either as they depend upon the next ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
immediately going before, or as they ſtand
in the whole building, and are as it were woven
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:220:9"/>
into the whole frame of the Apoſtles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
The connexion with the precedent
verſes is very eaſie and perſpicuous: you may
areed the meaning, if you will but read the
words, <hi>And all things are of God,</hi> &amp;c. theſe
are the words out of which you may eaſily
draw, and (with a little turning of the wheele
of your underſtanding) as it were ſpin the
words that I have read, thus: <hi>We have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion
to preach the word of reconciliation, that
is the good will of God, for reconciling man to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
by the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt: We have ſuch a
commiſsion from God: Ergo, we are Ambaſſadors
for Chriſt.</hi> But there is ſomething more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to obſerve how theſe make to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
end and ſcope of the Apoſtle: give me
leave to go back a little, and take the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of a run, that I may the better open the
meaning of theſe words. The faithfull Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
(as it is the condition of all that will be
faithfull) met with many rubs and much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
at <hi>Corinth,</hi> eſpecially from the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of proud <hi>Phariſees</hi> and learned <hi>Rabbins</hi>
among them: among other things, his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
were laid in his diſh, and that ſcandall
of the meaneneſſe of his perſon, was interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as a reall prejudice againſt the truth of his
profeſſion. You will ſay, a brutiſh collection,
and againſt a common rule of humanity; and
yet, to ſay truth, it is the common opinion of
carnall men; they judge of Religion by theſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:220:9"/>
outward impertinencies, rather than appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
they cannot fancy the truth, becauſe
of the ragged garment that ſhe weares. As on
the contrary, the tyrant boaſted that the Gods
approved of his ſacriledge, becauſe he ſailed
home with a faire gale of wind: <hi>Foelix ſcelus
virtus vocatur, Miſchief happy in the ſucceſſe is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vertue:</hi> and with the Papiſts, the oſtentation
of the proſperity of their eſtate, is the beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
of the ſincerity of their religion:
belike they have clipt the wings of proſperity
(as the <hi>Athenians</hi> did the wings of victory) that
ſhe cannot flie away from their Church: ſo
in this, <hi>Iobs</hi> friends reaſon thus, ſurely thou art
an hypocrite, or elſe thou hadſt never come
to this: And the <hi>Barbarians</hi> in the <hi>Acts</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
thus in their countrey barbarous Mood
and Figure, when they ſaw a viper upon <hi>Pauls</hi>
hand,<note place="margin">Acts 28. 4.</note> ſurely that man is a malefactor, juſtice
purſues him, and that vermin, as an officer of
juſtice, hath arreſted him. So do they of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi>
according to their barbarous divinity,
ſeeing <hi>Pauls</hi> miſery, as they conceived it, call
his miniſtery into queſtion: But the <hi>Apostle</hi>
wipes away both theſe imputations, the one
caſt upon his perſon, the other on his calling,
with one anſwer, and ſtops two gaps with one
buſh, looke 4. <hi>Chap. 7. Verſ. But we have this
treaſure in earthen veſſels, that the excellency of
the power may be of God, and not of us.</hi> As if he
ſhould have ſaid, our profeſſion is honourable,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:220:10"/>
though our perſon be contemptible; our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
is a treaſure, though we Miniſters be
but earthen veſſels; and theſe very earthen
veſſells, though they have but a baſe matter,
yet they have a bleſſed end: for they proclaim
to all the world, <hi>that the excellency of the power is
of God, and not of us.</hi> Is it thus, might ſome
man ſay, and is there nothing then that comes
to your ſhare? have you nothing but your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for your paines? is there nothing to be
gotten by the Goſpell but blowes and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Why then you may take all the gaines,
and put them in your eye (as we uſe to ſpeake)
and ſee never a whit the worſe, and then weep
them out againe. But I wonder what makes
you ſo faithfull in ſuch a fruitleſſe thing? why
are you ſo hot for that which yeelds ſuch cold
recompence? The <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> beſides the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of his function, alledges three reaſons
why afflictions did not daunt him, and daſh
him out of countenance, but he held on his
courſe and diligence in publiſhing the Goſpell:
I will but point them out and paſſe them over.</p>
               <p>1. From the hope of a bleſſed reward in
heaven, from the 13. Verſe of the 4. Chapter
to the 10. of this 5.</p>
               <p>2. From the feare of juſt puniſhment, and
a curſe, if he ſhould have done <hi>the worke of the
Lord negligently,</hi> in the 10. and 11. Verſe of
this Chapter, <hi>For we muſt all appeare,</hi> &amp;c. and
though here were weight enough to ſet the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:220:10"/>
moſt ruſty wheeles a going: yet becauſe theſe
two may work in baſe minds, and are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
but ſiniſter ends, which many that ſeem
to goe ſtreight, may looke a ſquint upon: feare
in the foreward, and reward and hope in the
rereward marſhall all his forces, and love in
the maine battell, or rather, <hi>tota in toto &amp; tota in
qualibet parte,</hi> animates every one to valour and
victory; puniſhment is ſervile, and hope of re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward
mercenary. He addes a third motive,
which is the peculiar character of a Chriſtian
mind, and that is love, in the 14 <hi>verſ.</hi> of this
<hi>Chap. For the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us,</hi> this is
that which winds up his affections to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of zeal and fervencie. And I pray mark
the words. Reward hath an attractive, and
puniſhment an impulſive, but love hath a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive
facultie. Reward drawes him, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
drives him, but love hales him forward,
to the diſcharge of his duty: Hope like a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Mother entices him with a reward, feare
like a ſevere Maſter incites him with puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but love like a Soveraigne Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
him. Hope hales before him, and feare
blowes behind him, and both on each ſide row
him, but love within him like the very ſoule
of obedience teaches him a naturall motion.
Behold againe a ſtrange agreement, force and
freedome, violent and voluntary, neceſſity and
liberty met together, and married; and which
is more, the moſt pure liberty with the moſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:220:11"/>
powerfull neceſſity, <hi>For the love of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth
us,</hi> the ſweeteſt natured affection.
Love is growne a tyrant and will needs force
and raviſh the virgin, freedome of will; which
hitherto hath been inviolate. Love conſtrains
not by <hi>forcible but by loving neceſsitie,</hi> as <hi>Plato</hi>
ſpeakes.<note place="margin">

why doth not every <hi>Vzzah</hi> lay hands upon the
Arke of God without any checke of juſtice?
why doth not every man that is not a ſtocke
or a Stoick, that hath any hope or feare or love,
become a Preacher, a publiſher of the Goſpell?
Yes I will tell you, <hi>Paul</hi> was an Apoſtle, he
had a calling which authorized him, to doe
what he did, and therefore all theſe wrought
upon him, and encouraged him to doe it dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.
This is the handle on which they all
lay hold; <hi>Now we being Ambaſſadors for Chriſt,
hope</hi> invites us, and <hi>feare</hi> commands us, and
<hi>love</hi> conſtraines us to ſtrive for our victory, to
ſee for our ſafety, to condeſcend to your infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in the faithfull execution of our miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and therefore in all earneſt, obedient, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:220:11"/>
humble manner, <hi>we pray you be ye reconciled to
God.</hi> I have made bold to crop theſe few tops
of flowers out of this Divine Garden which
lies before my text, where I muſt dwell ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
longer, and I meane to ſcruze the juyce
of them into my following diſcourſe. And
therefore if you find that it ſhall taſte of this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence,
you ſee the ingreedients, you need not
ſuſpect the operation. The ſumme of the
words is the ſumme of the Word of God,
they are a little Bible, an Enchiridion of the
whole volume, all the letters are compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly
abbreviated in theſe few characters,
all the particular words caſt up into this totall
ſumme, all the ſilver ſayings reduced into this
golden ſentence, that it may be more portable.
<hi>We pray you be ye reconciled to God,</hi> for here is the
knowledge of God; we pray you <hi>be ye reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to God,</hi> here is the knowledge of man; we
pray you be ye reconciled to God, here is the
knowledge of him that is both God and man;
we pray you in Chriſts ſtead, be ye reconciled
to God, here is the knowledge of them that
are ſent from God to man, to bring man to
God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We pray you in Christs ſtead be ye reconciled to
God.</hi> I ſhall not be curious in laying out the
parts, a popular argument will be content with
a popular diſtribution, I will but let the words
fall into your eares and they will breake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into two parts. <hi>Now therefore we are Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:220:12"/>
for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you
by us, we pray you be ye reconciled to God.</hi> You
ſee the words of their owne accord fall into
two parts. 1. Yee have the Ambaſſadors,
2. The Embaſſage: The Ambaſſadors in the
firſt words, <hi>We are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt,</hi>
The Embaſſage in the reſt; and then the laſt
words of the firſt part [<hi>for Christ</hi>] are as it
were the corner ſtone, in which the two build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are coupled; the middle ring, in which
the two extreames are joyned; the <hi>communis
terminus,</hi> in which the two parts are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
the joynts upon which they turne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and claſp one with another: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
I may expreſſe the ſame thing in better
termes, if I call the firſt the charge, the ſecond
the diſcharge; the firſt, the inſtitution of an
Office; the ſecond, the execution of it: In the
firſt, we have one Propoſition conſiſting of a
ſimple antecedent, and a triple conſequent;
the antecedent <hi>We,</hi> we are Ambaſſadors for
<hi>Chriſt:</hi> the primary conſequent is <hi>Ambaſſadors;
We are Ambaſſadors,</hi> which is attended with a
double illuſtration, and ſo altogether make a
treble attribution, as I told you: Firſt from
the Object about which they are employed,
<hi>for Chriſt; We are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt:</hi> The
ſecond from the Author, by whom they are
imployed, <hi>from God; We are Ambaſſadors for
Chriſt from God:</hi> indeed this is implyed in the
text, but muſt be ſupplyed out of the context,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:220:12"/>
as you may ſee eaſily, and ſhall ſee ſhortly.
This is the firſt part, and the ſecond is like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, as our Saviour ſaid of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
for there we have one propoſition like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
which hath a ſenſible proportion with
the former, but yet accompanied with ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
alterations: for, 1. It conſiſts of a
triple antecedent, and a ſimple conſequent
cleane contrary to it. 2. That which was the
conſequent before hath ſhifted his place, and
is now become the antecedent, the whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enriched with a new conſequent, which
was not in the former. 3. The three parts of
the conſequent have had a remove, that which
was laſt, is commended and preferred to be
firſt; and which was firſt, is degraded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to be laſt; only the middle, as the center,
is unmooved. And now thus it is; <hi>We are
Ambaſſadors for Chriſt from God,</hi> ther's the
antecedent, peeced out with the three parts of
the former conſequent: <hi>pray you be ye reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to God,</hi> ther's the conſequent, but the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the parts are inverted: for they ſhould
run as I propounded them, but they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
ſo, that they run cleane backward in
a<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> retrograde motion, as the Artiſts ſpeake:
We as Ambaſſadors for Chriſt from God,
comming from God, as though God did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you by us, comming for Chriſt, in
Chriſts ſtead, or in Chriſts name: comming
as Ambaſſadors or Orators, do play the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:220:13"/>
we pray you be ye reconciled to God.
The laſt point of the firſt, is the firſt of the laſt;
and the laſt of the laſt, is the firſt of the firſt,
and ſo they cloſe together much like the figure
which the Rhetoricians called<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>a circular fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,</hi>
and more like the yeare, of which the <hi>Poet,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>So that ye have in theſe words two propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
like two Semicircles, and <hi>we</hi> is the Center
upon which they both move; like two Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphears,
and <hi>we</hi> is the Horizon, which divides
the ſuperiour from the inferiour; both which
together make one ſolid Globe, and <hi>we</hi> is the
Diameter, that cuts it into equall portions, a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircle
of being, and a Semicircle of operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
an Hemiſphear of office, and an Hemiſphear
of action: The firſt, <hi>We are Ambaſſadors for God,</hi>
The ſecond, <hi>We as Ambaſsadors pray you to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to God.</hi> The contriving of theſe rooms
was ſo perplexed, that I am afraid my ſpeech
hath not given window enough to let in light
enough to cleare the paſſages: I am ſure I am
glad that I have wound my ſelfe out of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
Labyrinth, though I were to breake the
clue that guided me, and the thread of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
preſently.</p>
               <p>But now we have cut out the ſtuffe, we muſt
goe about to make up the garment. To begin
with the firſt. As the Stars in the Firmament
have a double vertue, of illumination and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
whereby they communicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:220:13"/>
to the inferiour bodies: So hath every
text in holy writ, an illumination of truth upon
the underſtanding, and an influence of grace
and goodneſſe upon the will; and therefore I
will endeavour to ſhew your apprehenſions
the light of truth in the explication of the
words, ſo that they may ſhed their influence of
grace upon your affections in their application.
The firſt word that offers it ſelfe to our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
is the ſubject <hi>we:</hi> which though it be
ſo concrete with that which followes in the
originall that it hath loſt it ſelfe, for there all
that ſentence is wrapped up in one word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>;
as the leſſer Starres when they have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
in too near a degree of propinquity
to the Sunne, as it were conſcious of their own
preſumption, they dare not be ſeene, or elſe
they forfeit their light to the Sunne their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne,
and are eclipſed. Yet a good Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician,
with his <hi>Prometheus</hi> fire, would ſever
theſe heterogeneals, and reſolve them into
their pure and primitive natures, and then
would appeare a paire of arguments, beſides
the yoke that holds them together, as our
tranſlation renders it, <hi>We are Ambaſsadors.</hi>
Well then, that firſt word (that we may take
the juſt meaſure of the meaning of it) muſt be
conſidered in three degrees of latitude. 1. It
reſpects himſelfe. 2. All his fellow Apoſtles.
3. All his Fellow-labourers in the Lords har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt.
The body of it moves within himſelfe,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:220:14"/>
as in his proper and particular Spheare, the
beames are caſt abroad upon all the Apoſtles
in a direct and perpendicular line, the beautie
and luſtre diffuſeth it ſelfe yet further in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall
liberality to every Miniſter of the
Word; I, and they, and all, we are Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
for <hi>Christ.</hi> 1. Himſelfe, I, who was an
abortive birth, a ſtranger, a wolfe, a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
a traitor, an enemy to the grace of God,
in my beſt principles of nature; I am become,
by the rich mercy of God, a darling ſonne, a
Subject, a Shepheard, a Preacher, a Favourite,
an Ambaſſador of the grace of God in <hi>Ieſus
Chriſt:</hi> I am an Ambaſſador. Thus the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
chewes as it were upon his office, as the
wounded <hi>Hart</hi> upon the famous <hi>Dictamum,</hi>
and all the poiſoned Arrowes of reproach and
obloquy, drop off. Thus he ſhakes the <hi>Viper</hi>
off his hand, which thoſe barbarous enemies
thought to have beene deadly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the reaſon
why he ſpeakes in the plurall number, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of humility partly, and partly of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
It is the language of humility, when a
man is urged to a neceſſary<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> ſelfe-praiſe, and
forced by the importunity of others, to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
himſelf, yet to qualifie his ſpeech as much
as may be. So doth the Apoſtle here excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently,
it ſeemes good to him to diſtribute this
honour to many, that he may not ſeeme to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
too much to himſelfe, and this plurall
number is a phraſe of ſingular humility, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:220:14"/>
thus the ſtile of Princes runnes (we will and
our pleaſure) joyning their Counſell or the
whole State with themſelves: For I rather
take that frequent anomalie for an intimation
of modeſty, then of majeſtie, though I am not
ignorant how others apprehend it. Again here
is a myſtery of wiſdome in this word. For as
a Deere that is eagerly purſued will immerſe
it ſelfe into the whole heard, that ſo ſhe may
ſuſpend the violence of the chaſe, by the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity
of the choiſe in ſuch variety of game:
So <hi>Paul</hi> being ſingled out by calumny, doth
mingle himſelfe with the whole fellowſhip of
Apoſtles. Or as one in danger of arreſting
will take ſanctuary in ſome priviledged place:
So <hi>Paul</hi> takes ſanctuary at the Colledge of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.
2. This word beſides the particular
appropriation which it hath to <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe,
muſt needs be interpreted, according to the
true propriety of the number, and meaning;
and ſo it extends it ſelfe. 1. To all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.
2. To all Miniſters of the Word, both
of them are Ambaſſadors, for they agree in the
ſubſtance of their commiſſion, though there
be ſome difference in the circumſtance of the
execution: the Apoſtolike office, indeed, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
a more lively reſemblance of an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
then the ordinary Miniſtery, in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards.
1. They were authorized by <hi>Chriſt</hi>
himſelfe, and ſo received their inſtructions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from his mouth, who is the King of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:220:15"/>
the Church; and accordingly were furniſhed
with all ſufficiencies, by the inſpiration of
his Spirit; they beſtowed not much time and
travaile to ſpeake forreine languages, (a thing
neceſſary for Ambaſſadors) but as <hi>Eſaie's</hi>
tongue was touched by a <hi>Seraphim</hi> with a cole
from the Altar, ſo they had cloven and fiery
tongues, beſtowed on them by the Spirit: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
that, they had the gift of miracles, as it
were the broad ſeale of Heaven, annexed to
their letters of credit. But with our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
it is not ſo, but they are brought up at the
feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and trained up in the Schooles
of the Prophets, and purchaſe their abilities (as
he in the <hi>Acts</hi> did his freedome) with a great
ſumme of labour, and time, and coſt: and then
the Church the Spouſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſince her
Lords departure, as a Matron, weares the keyes
of authority at her girdle, opens to them a
doore of utterance and admits them to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Altar. As they had a more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall
miſſion, ſo they had a motion more
obſervable, which addes as it were life and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to the image, and picture of Ambaſſadors.
They were diſpatched into all coaſts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the world; but ours are faſtned to ſome
one place, like pillars of reſidence; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
theſe petty differences, ſeeing
they have the ſame ſphear of activity, in which
they moove, to reconcile men to God, and the
ſame Sun of authority, by which they moove,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:220:15"/>
the power of the Church, being the power of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> derived to her, (as we call them the
Kings officers, who are created not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
by his Majeſtie, but in vertue of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and in ſubordination to his Royall prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative)
And laſtly, ſeeing the ſimilitude may
be preſerved entire in both, though this varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be confeſſed: there being a difference in the
type Ambaſſadors, much like that in the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type
of Miniſters; ſo that either may anſwer
the patterne: And our ordinary Miniſters ſute
with agents or leiger Ambaſſadors, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
came neerer to extraordinary. In all
theſe reſpects they alſo being included, the
whole extent of this word <hi>We</hi> hath three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees:
1. Himſelfe, 2. All his fellow Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
3. All his fellow-labourers in the Lords
harveſt. I have made ſome haſte, but the
time I feare hath over runne me much, and
therefore for that which is behind of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
I will lay downe but the rude linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and proportion, and leave the perfect
colours and complexion to another time. The
ſecond word (<hi>Ambaſſadors</hi>) is a ſpeech bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
from Princes Courts, and applyed to
<hi>Chriſt</hi> his Church, by a decent analogy. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
are meſſengers from one Prince or
State to another, about ſuch affaires as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
both. You may obſerve three moments
of being, in this rude deſcription; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
draw out three paralell lines, in which,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:220:16"/>
the termes of compariſon do runne along one
by another in a ſweet proportion. 1. They are
both Meſſengers. 2. They are both from
Princes. 3. They are both about matters of
mutuall behoofe.</p>
               <p>But, becauſe you know a ſimilitude is a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thing, and muſt be gently handled, you
muſt not ſqueize it too much, and ſtretch it too
farre, leſt you breake the harmony and analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
the Muſicke and Logicke of the parts; I
ſhall pray you to carry along with you three
maine diſcords in which they jarre, leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
your ſelves an harmony, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in
every note and point; you be offended too
much with every harſhneſſe and inequality.
1. Ambaſſadors are therefore ſent from Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
becauſe them ſelves cannot be preſent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where: but the Lord of theſe Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,
as he is in no predicament of time, becauſe
he inhabiteth eternity; ſo he is in no <hi>vbi,</hi> but
ubiquity. 2. Ambaſſadors are directed to
Princes only, or free Eſtates, and that from
ſome Peere, who can neither claime ſubjection
of them, nor ſuperioritie over them to whom
he ſends. But theſe are ſent to ſubjects, to
vaſſalls, to rebels; from him, to whom all
owe an oath of allegiance; to whoſe ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
the higheſt muſt ſubſcribe; to whoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigntie,
all the ſonnes of the mighty are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
in a politicall, naturall, eſſentiall order
of dependance. 3. Ambaſſadors are ſet forth
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:220:16"/>
with ſome beſeeming port and pompe, that
they may ſuſtaine the perſon of majeſtie, and
ſupport the majeſtie of the perſon, whom they
repreſent. But with theſe it is nothing ſo, the
Chariots of their glory, are the ſhame of their
Lords houſe, who, to ſpeak with reverence, is
like ſome rich Gentleman in the Countrey,
who in a bravery, ſcornes to bee brave. The
third word of the Text remaines, [<hi>for Chriſt</hi>]
which may beare a threefold conſtruction:
wherein <hi>Christ</hi> may be conceived, either, as
the author, or the end, the Alpha and Omega
of this Ambaſſage, or thirdly, the object of
theſe Ambaſſadors, the center, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of their imployment. But I promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but a delineation of theſe things: only give
me leave to cloſe up all, with one obſervation
out of the words: I noted before that this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
[<hi>We are Ambaſſadors</hi>] is cloſer truſſed
up in the Originall, into one word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a
word of a precious emphaſis, which is much
abated, and very dilute, almoſt loſt in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
for that word of action, ſignifying the
office, may tell us ſo much in our eares, that
thoſe officers muſt be men of action, they muſt
be of a nimble and active conſtitution. The
men of the earth may be of a more dull and ſad
temper, they may fold their armes, they may
ſtretch themſelves upon their beds of Ivory,
and turne themſelves upon them, as the doore
turnes upon the hinges: But theſe Meſſengers
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:220:17"/>
of Heaven, muſt be like Heaven in perpetuall
motion: They may well fall to a <hi>motus trepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dationis,</hi>
if they but once forget their daily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe.
They that preach <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Sonne of
righteouſneſſe, muſt be like the Sunne, who
commeth forth of his chamber, like a bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome,
and rejoyceth to runne his race, as a
mighty man; and yet when they have done all,
there will be many ſonnes of darkneſſe, that
will live in a night of ſecurity, and ſleepe and
ſnort in ſinne: there will be many cold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,
that are frozen to their luſts, and will
not be thawed by that Divine Lamp, and mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the teares of true repentance. And
therefore this tranſlation, We are Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,
<hi>nimis lentum eſt:</hi> We <hi>ergo</hi> Ambaſſadors,
<hi>hoc quoque eſt nimis lentum.</hi> Theſe Miniſters
muſt fly, like the <hi>Cherubims</hi> that give atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
in the preſence of God, they muſt have
ſixe winges for expedition, in the execution of
his will: they have wings upon their feet, a
ſtrange thing, wings upon their feet; no they
cannot foot it faſt enough, but they muſt
ſpeed their race with flight, <hi>remis velíſque,</hi> the
booke they carry, is ſuch as the Prophet ſaw, a
flying booke; and <hi>Christ</hi> himſelfe in their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery,
ſitteth betweene the Cherubims, and
rideth upon the wings of the winde, and ſo
communicates himſelfe to all Nations.</p>

thus farre the laſt time,
to lay downe the coherence of
theſe words, with the former,
and to lay open the particulars
in them contained. The firſt
point of Doctrine, that we ſtarted then, was,
That Miniſters of the Word, are Gods Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors.
I touched lightly both the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiall
differences, which might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected;
and the ſubſtantiall agreement, which
muſt be obſerved, as it was intended, in this

reſolution of a queſtion, before I goe any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For what neceſſity can be imagined,
that God ſhould ſend his Ambaſſadors to us;
or, if that be ſuppoſed, what conveniency may
be conceived, that men, and meane men ſhould
be imployed in ſo honourable a ſervice? To
the firſt part of the queſtion, I ſhall ſhape an
anſwer briefly. Looke as ſome royall King,
when his naturall ſubjects, have unnaturally
rebelled, and taken up armes againſt him; (like
the churliſh <hi>Iſraelites, We have no portion in
David, no inheritance in the ſonne of Iſhai, every
man to his tents O Iſrael.</hi>) that he may curb their
inſolencie, with the bridle of Soveraigne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
is ready to ſend forth a decree of
wrath, by the hand of the meſſengers of death:
But the young Prince, out of his ſpeciall grace
and princely compaſſion, ſtepping betweene
them and the blow, and interceeding for them,
is intreated to reverſe the ſentence, and diſpatch
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:220:18"/>
a Proclamation of pardon, to all ſuch of them as
within the prefixed period ſhall return to their
obedience: So we having committed high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
againſt the moſt High, in moſt ungracious
manner, and lifted up the hand againſt our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
(like the proud tyrant that belched forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this,
<hi>Who is God, that we ſhould obey him? or
who is the Lord, that we ſhould ſerve him?</hi>) whoſe
hands had but even then faſhioned us; and the
decree of death being gone forth againſt us,
Thou ſhalt dye the death; <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Sonne of God, the Prince of peace, hath
interpoſed himſelfe for us, and latched the
blow (that would have ſunk us to Hell) upon
his owne body, which he gave for us on the
Croſſe; that ſo reconciliation being made in
his blood, the Father might be well pleaſed in
him, to ſpeake peace unto us, and proclaime a
free pardon to all that ſhould believe, by the
ſilver Trumpet of the Goſpell: <hi>Returne, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
for why will ye die ô houſe of Iſrael?</hi> This
is the neceſſity: wherein you may obſerve on
mans part, no meritorious excellencies, but
miſerable extremity: On Gods part, no forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
compulſion, but a moſt feeling and free
compaſſion, that cauſed him to viſite us, with
theſe comfortable meſſengers. And this I
might exemplifie in all, if I would run through
all kinde of Ambaſſages. As, ſome are to
moove, and make marriages: So is this, to
eſpouſe the Soule to a noble Bridegroome, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:220:19"/>
                  <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Some are for commerce and
traffick; and ſo is this: that we might have a
ſecure and ſweet entercourſe with the Lord, as
once we had, before the league was broken in
Paradiſe, in integrity: that the Lord might
tranſport us to that <hi>aureum vellus,</hi> the robe of
<hi>Christs</hi> righteouſneſſe, who was the <hi>Lambſtain
from the beginning of the world;</hi> that <hi>Pearle</hi> of
price, that rich <hi>Margarite,</hi> the Kingdome of
Heaven; and might receive againe of us, by
way of exchange, (a poore exchange, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
precious in his ſight) our humble and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
obedience. But which way ſoever you
pleaſe to patterne the materials of the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
you ſhall find no other motive but what
I ſaid before, Gods incomparable mercy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
with a tender and compaſſionate eye,
mans irrecoverable miſery. This may ſuffice
for a taſte of a farther anſwer, to the firſt point
in the queſtion, concerning the neceſſity why
God ſends Ambaſſadors; for I ſhould but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
my following diſcourſe, if I ſhould
labour to give the full ſatisfaction. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
point comes now to be conſidered. For
if there muſt needs be Ambaſſadors, why are
not ſome of thoſe glorious Cherubims, and
Seraphims, that ſhine with knowledge, and
burne with zeale, that cry, <hi>holy, holy, holy, Lord
God of Sabbath;</hi> that like courtiers of the King of
Heaven, attend upon his Royall perſon, and
behold the face of their heavenly Father, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:220:19"/>
ready to execute his will and pleaſure;
why are not ſome of theſe preferred to this
honour? I am ſure ſuch a liturgie, might
well beſeeme the higheſt Hierarchie; ſuch a
meſſage, the tongue of Angels; ſuch ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
truths, ſuch Angelicall and Seraphicall
Doctors. And who more fit to diſpence the
Word of God, the heavenly Mannah, the food
of Angels, then the ſonnes of God, then An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels?
Who can tell me the miſtery of this
ſtrange proceeding, that they ſhould be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
and man exalted to this dignity?
May not every one preſume to refuſe this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
without preſumption, and diſobey ſuch a
command, without diſobedience; or will not
ſuch preſumption, be counted humility; and
ſuch diſobedience, modeſtie? As <hi>Moſes</hi> when
he ſhould have gone in Gods errand, <hi>What am
I, that I ſhould goe to Pharaoh, or deliver the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Iſrael out of Egypt?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 3. 11. 12.</note> though the Lord
removed the ſcruple, when he anſwered, <hi>I am

number farre exceeded his; but how many

of God, <hi>by which we are that which we are,</hi> and

And who is ſo highly priviledged above <hi>Moſes,</hi>
that might not ſhrinke as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, when hee
ſhould conſider with himſelf the weightineſſe
of the worke, and the weakneſſe of his owne
perſon,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 16.</note> and ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>who is ſufficient
for theſe things?</hi> But it is time to frame an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer:
Though neither our ſhallow capacitie
can ſound the depth of Gods counſels, nor he
be bound to render a reaſon of his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
yet he gives us both liberty to enquire
with ſobriety, and light to finde out ſo much
that we may go away with reaſonable ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And therefore I pray obſerve with
me three principall Reaſons, why the Lord
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:220:20"/>
who wants neither wiſdome, or power, to
contrive it otherwiſe, either by immediate ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiation,
upon the underſtanding, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
into the will, or by the miniſterie of the
bleſſed Angels, yet thought good rather to
make uſe of the helpe of man, for the bringing
of man to himſelfe, and working that mighty
worke of converſion, which our Divines have
thought, and taught not without ſome proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
of reaſon, to be greater than the great
worke of the firſt creation. The firſt, I take
to be from the nature of the thing, wherewith
this order ſtands in greater congruity divers
wayes: For firſt of all, ſuppoſing things <hi>in ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu
quo,</hi> that God will have men deſcend by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
propagation, and divide themſelves into
politicall ſocieties; of which, and out of
which, he will call ſome to grace, which ſhall
come by degrees, not powred in all at once,
but dropped in, <hi>by little and little, here a
line, and there a line.</hi> It ſures not with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Angels, to have ſuch ordinary, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
commerce with men, as is neceſſary to
accompliſh this: for men in this caſe, muſt be
alwaies feeding, as children uſe, and muſt have
continuall hand and tending: well indeed they
may be dry nurſes, to watch, and preſerve, and
protect the children of God; but to be fathers
to beget them by the immortall ſeed of the
Word, to be wet nurſes, to ſuccle them with
the ſyncere pure milke of the Word, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:220:21"/>
be. So that, unleſſe we would imagine
the whole face of nature changed, and all
moulded into a new frame, this peece would
not hold proportion with the reſt. Nay, it
were a thing irregular, and a kinde of violence
to the Angelicall nature, to converſe with men
in this kinde, whereas we all know, <hi>nullum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olentum
eſt perpetuum,</hi> there be few Analogies,
but there be none Anomalies that are perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
Indeed the Lord uſes them for the good
of man many times, but their part is not to be
alwayes on the Stage. 2. By this meanes,
man is drawne to God in ſuch a manner, as is
moſt convenient for his nature, not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his compoſition (for by preaching of
the Word, his ſenſible part is wrought upon,
and affected) but alſo in regard of his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
for as in the free motions of nature, there
is (that I may uſe a diſtinction ſomething nice
for the termes, but neceſſary for the thing) I
ſay, a cooperation, without any coaction: ſo
in the firſt motion of grace, though the Lord
worke with a certaine infallibility, and as I
may ſay, a ſweet neceſſity, yet he doth not offer
violence to any principle of nature, which hath
ſome evidence, ever from this, that God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
workes it by man; ſo that if you looke to both
the cauſes, the principall, and inſtrumentall,
you may ſay it is the work of God, therefore
there is no poſſibilitie of reſiſtance; it is the
work of man, therefore there is no ſhew nor
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:220:21"/>
ſhadowes of violence: and theſe two muſt goe
together, for as the King in <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaid of a
groat,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> it is
no baſe bribe: So may we ſay in this caſe,
to worke with danger of failing, agrees not
with the power of God, whoſe will is not
will, if not omnipotent, except it can worke
what it will. Againe, to worke by way of
forcing, agrees not with the nature of man,
whoſe will is not will, except it will what it
workes. I ſhould enterpret my ſelfe more
fully, for feare of unkind conſtructions, but
that I muſt make haſte. 3. There is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
that ſeeing the Sonne of God became
the ſonne of man, that the ſons of men might
become the ſonnes of God; and we having all
received of his fulneſſe grace for grace, his
gifts of grace ſhould be conveighed as by a
conduit pipe by the ſame nature: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apoſtle, painting forth unto us that
goodly body of the Church, of which, <hi>Christ</hi>
is the head, makes <hi>Apostles, Evangelists, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,</hi>
all men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the organicall parts of that
body, which receive ſenſe, and motion, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
from the head: and for this purpoſe,
he is (as the head) <hi>annointed with the oyle of
gladneſſe above his fellowes,</hi> that is, in greater
meaſure, and above, that from him it may diſtil
by the higher to the loweſt members. Now
the Angels are not univocall members with
us, under the ſame head, though for the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:220:22"/>
of <hi>Chriſts</hi> merit, whether it may any way
redound to thoſe bleſſed Spirits, I will neither
peremptorily deny, nor diſpute for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:
and therefore it is more meet, the Word
ſhould be committed to men than Angels, or
any other creatures. The ſecond principall
reaſon may be this, becauſe it is moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for man, that men ſhould be Gods Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors,
and that in three reſpects. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this honour is both a fruit of <hi>Chriſts</hi> exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<hi>Who aſcended on high and led captivitie
captive, and gave gifts unto men;</hi> and thoſe gifts,
are the miniſteriall gifts, as you may ſee in the
place: and beſides it is a reall pledge of Gods
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> affection to man, not only to the perſons ſo
dignified, but alſo in them to all mankinde, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as great offices in the Court beſtowed on
any, are ordinarily arguments of great grace
with the King. 2. Becauſe it is a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
and likely way to bring men to God, for
many reaſons, which I will but propound, and
ſo proceed. 1. In that God deales familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with us, which is a wondrous art to win af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
You know the Fable of the <hi>Theban</hi>
Dame, that was miſperſwaded to intreat <hi>lupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
to company with her in all his majeſtie, to
which when he condeſcended, ſhe was ſo
farre from taking that pleaſure ſhe promiſed
her ſelfe from her goodly Bridegroome, that
ſhe loſt her life: So could not our feeble ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
brooke the preſence of the Divine glory,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:220:22"/>
if he ſhould vouchſafe to come unto us in all
his Royaltie. I will not tell you any Poeticall
Fable, but the truth of God. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
tryed this, for when the <hi>Lord appeared to them
in Mount Sinai with thunder and lightning,</hi> they
preſently found their owne weakneſſe, and
made ſuit to <hi>Moſes, Let not the Lord ſpeake unto
us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 20 18, 19</note> 
                  <hi>leſt we die, but ſpeake thou unto us, and we will
heare thee.</hi> And therefore <hi>Iob</hi> wiſhes that God
would lay aſide his <hi>terrour,</hi> and reaſon with
him <hi>familiarly,</hi> to which when the Lord gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
condeſcended, what was the iſſue? in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of his former diſputation, he grew to this
concluſion,<note place="margin">Iob. 42. 6. Deut. 18. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>I abhorre my ſelfe in dust and aſhes.</hi>
And God promiſes this as a bleſſing, <hi>I will
raiſe you up a Prophet from among your brethren,
he ſhall teach you.</hi> And therefore the Lord
ſtooping to our capacitie, gives us ſo as we
may receive, and ſpeakes to us men by the
mouth of men, as the moſt proportionable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
to worke upon us. Not much unlike
<hi>Aſtyanax,</hi> in the Poet, who when his father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
armed came to embrace him,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> the child
forthwith hid his face in his nurſes boſome,
cryed, and being afraid at the ſight of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when he ſaw his hairy Plume upon his
Headpeece bending towards him. Like as
the Sunne when he liſts to be ſeene, delayes
his beames in ſome thicker cloud, that the
edge of his brightneſſe being abated, our dim
eyes may not be too much offended. Againe,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:220:23"/>
thus the troubled ſoule, may have free acceſſe
to the Miniſter, which comfort could hardly
be conveighed another way: eſpecially, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
whom the Lord makes choice of, to
beſtow the riches of his grace upon, not the
great ones of the world ſo much, but the mean
ones. Now as you have ſeene in a Faire, the
Countrey people will not venture into the rich
Shops, among the fine Citizens, but had rather
beſtow their money on ſome countrey Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
ſo it may bee in this caſe: and
therefore the Lord appoints men, and meane
men, that even the meaneſt Chriſtians may
more freely repaire unto them. 2. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the miniſtery of Men, is more credible then
Angels, or any other could be; for though
their teſtimony be of more weight in it ſelfe,
by reaſon of their acurate knowledge, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
fidelity; yet I know not how a man may
have more advantages to deale with us: for to
let paſſe the irrefragable authority of the word
of God, upon which all divine truths muſt
ſtand, which would be needleſſe, if it pleaſed
God to take any other courſe than this; and to
omit that it is hard to give ſuch infallible cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
wherby divine illuminations, might be
diſtinguiſhed from diabolicall illuſions, that
all ambignity might be taken away; I ſay,
1. Firſt, men converſe with us, are knowne,
they are our brethren, fleſh of our fleſh, and
bone of our bone, and therefore what ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:220:23"/>
can ariſe, that they, who are otherwiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
ſhould goe about to deceive us, in a
thing that is as much worth as our ſoule is.
2. They cannot deceive others, but they muſt
deceive their owne ſoule, being they are in <hi>eâ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
navi,</hi> in the ſame condition. 3. They
confirme their owne words, and adde a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
of practice to the text of preaching,
with their workes; and by taſting themſelves
of what they preſcribe to us, ſecuring us of
all feare of poyſon. 4. Laſtly, they may, and
doe ſometimes ſet a ſeale of ſuffering to their
ſaying: but I paſſe to the third. Thirdly, the
miniſtery of men is moſt effectuall, as for
thoſe reſpects touched before, and becauſe
they ſymbolize in qualities; whereas Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
teacheth, that there is eaſieſt tranſmutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
where there is a Symbolicall quality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the agent and the patient: and becauſe
they ſympathize in nature, ſo that there may be
a ſecret attractive power, as we ſee in the
Loadſtone to the Iron, or rather a mutuall
conſpiring to embrace one another: So
even by the very art of perſwading: I know
not what the tongue-eloquence of Angels is,
and the Apoſtle ſeems to mention them with
intimation of excellency, neither will I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
againſt all commers that a man may be a
better Orator than an Angell: but I know the
Lord is, and he hath put his Word into the
mouth of man, he that made the heart and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:220:24"/>
tryes the reines, he knowes how to frame
words that will affect the heart, and ſo they
doe inſinuate themſelves into the darkeſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of it with wondrous power and efficacie.
And this I know and dare avouch, that the
higheſt myſterie in the Divine Rhetorick is to
feele what a man ſpeakes, and then ſpeak what
a man feeles.<note place="margin">

taking the patterne from that paſſion which he
felt in his owne heart. And therefore this
advantage a man hath, that he having a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

himſelfe taſted, how ſweet the blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
is, how ſoveraigne to a ſinfull ſoule, by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentall,
as well as contemplative Divinitie.
The heart beſt underſtands the language of the
heart. But as this ordinance is profitable to
men, becauſe it is honourable to the Miniſter,
and beneficiall to the people, ſo there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
utility redounds to both. For thirdly, it
is one of the ſtrongeſt bonds of love betweene
Chriſtians, who are hereby made givers and
receivers in the moſt precious things, it is a
knot to tie man and God together, God ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to man by the Miniſter, and man ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to God, it is the mid way as it were,
in which they meet, and though there be more
ſubtile bonds of faith, and Gods Spirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we are immediately united to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and
made members of his myſticall body: yet for
our viſible communion with him in his politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:220:24"/>
body, the Miniſters are as it were the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments.
There remains yet one of the three
principall reaſons, Why the Lord makes men
his Ambaſſadors, and it muſt not be omitted,
becauſe it is the moſt principall among the
three: and this it is. 3. He gaines moſt glory
this way, for, the weaker the inſtrument is for
outward pomp, or appearance, the greater had
need to be the power, and ſo the praiſe of the
artificer;<note place="margin">Eccl. 10. 10.</note>

it very often, and very pathetically, <hi>O
that men would therefore praiſe the Lord for his

for the children of men, Pſalme</hi> 107. He gives
all the commodity of the world to the ſonnes
of men, receiving only this Royaltie to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;
he cals for no other tribute, but that we
attribute all to him. Now when he workes by
ſimple meanes, all the glory comes entirely to
him, there is none to ſhare with him, none to
cry halfes with him, mens mindes cannot reſt
in the inferiour cauſes, they muſt needs looke
higher and ſay, <hi>This is the Lords doing, and it is
marvellous in our eyes:</hi> whereas if the meanes
had many faire probabilities in them, God
muſt needs be robbed of a great part of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
both becauſe men are ready to thinke
highly of themſelves, and magnifie their owne
actions, and alſo becauſe others are ready to
aſcribe much to the immediate agent, who is

bonitie (which we call bountie) hath
ſuch a lively reſemblance of the Divinitie, that
weake eyes can hardly know them aſunder:
it was once <hi>Dionyſius</hi> his ſophiſtry, <hi>Dii boni
ſunt, eorum ergo bonitate utendum;</hi> but it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all mens naturall Logick, <hi>Boni ſunt, ergo

<q>

               <p>And therefore the Lord to prevent all ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
uſurpation, and vindicate his owne
title, effects great things ſometimes without
meanes, ſometimes with very ſmall meanes,
that in all matter of praiſe, the image and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
may be his only. And therefore as
when <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Bibulus</hi> were Conſuls toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and <hi>Bibulus</hi> did nothing, being over-awed
by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> they were wont to write in jeſting
manner, <hi>Iulio &amp; Caeſare Conſulibus:</hi> So if it
pleaſe God at any time to aſſume man to be
his colleague, in any great action, we muſt not
ſay God and man did ſuch a thing, but God
and his grace, did ſuch a thing. And it may be
ſaid well enough of him, as it was of <hi>Caeſar</hi> in
in another cauſe, <hi>Socium habet neminem,</hi> he may
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:220:26"/>
have a companion, but he muſt not have a
competitor. Perhaps indeed, the fooliſh Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
that couſened himſelfe with a ſilly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme,
and concluded, that God did not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
the world, becauſe he had nothing to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
it withall: <hi>Quae ferramenta, quae machinae,
qui vectes, qui miniſtri tanti operis fuerunt?</hi>
perhaps, I ſay, he, when he heard of Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
from a God, and a new creation, and ſaw
nothing but men, and weak men, Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
would make a ſcoffe againe, <hi>at qui Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtri?</hi>
and would either denie the thing, becauſe
he did not like the meanes, or would hardly
be perſwaded, that ſuch Atomes could do ſuch
great wonders. But God ſees not as man ſees:
he in his wiſdome uſes this courſe, for the
cauſe alledged. It is time to conclude, but
yet give me leave to confirme this with two
places of Scripture, and two examples: The
firſt is the 2 <hi>Corinth 4. 7. But we have this
treaſure in earthen veſsels, that the excellencie of
the power may be of God and not of us:</hi> I will not
urge it becauſe I have uſed it before, ſince I
entred into this argument. The ſecond is, the
1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1. from 17. to the end of the <hi>Chapter,</hi>
a known Text, where as Apoſtle diſcourſes
this at large, The ſumme is this: <hi>It pleaſed God
by the fooliſhneſſe of Preaching to ſave them that
believe.</hi> And againe, <hi>Brethren, you ſee your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
how not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mighty, not many noble that are called:</hi> And
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:220:26"/>
wherefore is this? <hi>God hath choſen the fooliſh
things of this world, to confound the wiſe, and God
hath choſen the weake things of the world, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the things that are mighty, and baſe things
of the world, and things that are deſpiſed, hath God
choſen; yea, and things that are not, to bring to
nought, things that are:</hi> and what of this? <hi>That
no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence:</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of all is according as it is written, <hi>He
that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</hi> The words
need no Commentary, and therefore I paſſe to
the examples. The firſt you ſhall finde in the
7. of <hi>Iudges,</hi> There the Lord overthrowes
the <hi>Midianites by Gideon,</hi> who at firſt had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
thirty two thouſand men, but theſe
were too many for the Lord to worke with,
therefore he will have them as it were boyled
by two decoctions, till they ſunke firſt to ten
thouſand, but there were yet too many, then
to three hundred, and then they march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the enemy, who were more then one
hundred and thirty thouſand, and covered the
land like Graſhoppers: but I pray, how were
theſe three hundred appointed? we doe not
read ſo much as of a ſword they had, but they
carried a <hi>Trumpet in their right hand, and emptie
Pitchers, with a Lampe in their Pitchers in
their left hand:</hi> and what did they? we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
find a ſtroke they ſtrooke, but only they
<hi>blew their Trumpets, and brake their Pitchers, and
cryed, The ſword of the Lord, and of Gide on,</hi> and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:220:27"/>
their enemies fell downe dead, or fled before
them: and the end of all is couched in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> Leſt <hi>Iſrael ſhould
vaunt himſelfe againſt nee, and ſay, mine owne hand
hath ſaved me.</hi> The ſecond, is the 6. of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi>
where the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> beſeiged <hi>Iericho,</hi> and won
it, a ſtrange ſeige, and a ſtrange victory: the
Prieſts carried the Arke of God about the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and blew with Rams-hornes, they compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it about ſix dayes, and ſeven times the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day, and this was all: there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

ſeige laid, but the Arke of God; no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Arietes</hi> to batter the wals, but the Rams<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hornes;
no Ordnance, but the ordinance of
God that commanded this; they did not
lift up an hand againſt it, only they lifted up
their voyces; they did not ſhoot once, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhout, and the wals of <hi>Iericho,</hi> as it were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to doe ſome holy ſervice, on Gods holy
Sabboth, did obeyſance to the Arke of God,
(as <hi>Dagon</hi> did) they fell downe flat, as it were,
and worſhipped the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> I made
choiſe of theſe the rather, among infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
becauſe I may paralell both with the
thing in hand, for the Preaching of the Word
is but like the ſounding of Rams-hornes (in
the judgement of carnall men) towards the
ſhaking of the wals of <hi>Iericho,</hi> towards the
caſting downe the ſtrong holds of ſinne. And
the former would make a ſweet Embleme of
it. A Souldier with a Trumpet in the right
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:220:27"/>
hand, and an earthen Pitcher with a Lamp in
the left hand, lively repreſenting the Miniſter,
who doth both in his miniſtery ſound the
Trumpet of the Goſpell, and in his martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
break his body, like ſome earthen pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that the glory of God might breake forth,
through the humane frailtie, like a Lamp, and
ſhine more bright and cleare. But I muſt paſſe
over theſe, I will touch but one thing, and
ſo conclude: for there is yet another reſpect
in which God gets glory by this order, and
that is, becauſe by this meanes, he takes try all
of the obedience of his children, whether they
will entertaine ſuch homely meſſengers for his
ſake, who ſends them, and yeeld obedience to
him, whoſe will they publiſh. But too much
of this argument, which I am affraid ſome
may think needleſſe, or fruitleſſe: and the truth
is, I ſhould not have gone ſo farre in this path,
if I had not obſerved ſome worthies of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
all the way before me.</p>

that ſitting in the Emperors

obſerving two tables full of
gueſts; the lower, of poore

he asked what they were: the Emperor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered;
Theſe are the Servants of our God,

<hi>Saracen</hi> among theſe true ſonns of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
ſonnes of Promiſe, ſonnes of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
that will pick a hole in the coat of Gods
true ſervants, his Ambaſſadors, that ſo they
may picke a quarrell with Gods true religion:
I may not thinke ſo. And yet I thinke I may
take occaſion here, to take away all occaſion
of doubting, that may perhaps ariſe in ſome
weake judgements. For as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> could not
better apprehend, or expreſſe the magnitude
of God, then by the magnificence of the King
of <hi>Perſia:</hi> ſo there may be ſome babes in <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
not throughly weaned from the vanities of this
world, that would require ſome outward emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies
in the Miniſters of the Word, to prove
that they are Gods Ambaſſadors; which if
they be wanting, though they dare not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
the truth, becauſe they profeſſe to believe
ſo much, yet they cannot conceive the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
becauſe they do not believe ſo much as they
profeſſe. And therefore having cleared this the
laſt time, why God made choiſe of meane
men for this honourable office, rather then of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:220:29"/>
the Glorious Cherubims, and Seraphims, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then of the ſonnes of the mighty: give
me leave now to produce ſome few evidences,
by which it may appeare, that theſe men are
indeed Gods Ambaſſadors. The ground of
this is plaine (as I touched alſo before) for
this great world, is a little Kingdome, wherein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
God is the ſoveraign Lord, the King of Kings,
and all men for their poſſieſſions, are his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants;
for their functions, his Lievtenants; and
in this great world, the little flock of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is
a great family, in which, God is the great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the family. There can nothing be done
in this family, in this Kingdome, without the
authority of this Maſter, of this King, and
therefore the Miniſters of the Word, muſt
needs be diſpenſers of his ſpeciall favour, in
the great family of his Church, from him, as
from the great Maſter of this family. And
againe, Ambaſſadors of his Royall pleaſure, in
his Kingdome of the world, from him, as from
their ſupreme Lord the King of Kings. But
why doe I produce the ground? the Text is
plaine: <hi>We are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt,</hi> and if
you caſt your eyes back to the foregoing <hi>verſe,</hi>
you ſhall ſee from whom, namely <hi>from God.</hi>
And the ſame Apoſtle, in the laſt of the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi>
uſeth the ſame word to the ſame purpoſe,
<note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 20. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>For whom I am an Ambaſsador in chaines:</hi>
where a man would think, hearing of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador,
that he ſpake of a golden chaine, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:220:30"/>
in ſome kind of vanity boaſted of it. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
the ſervants of God are noble and free,
though fettered in chaines of Iron, as the ſlaves
of ſinne are baſe priſoners, though in chaines
of Gold. And in this ſenſe I thinke I may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
to the ſtory and cuſtome of wearing
chaines, and ſay the Divell deales with them, as
the <hi>Aetoli</hi> ſcoffingly ſaid of <hi>Titus Flaminius</hi> the
<hi>Romane</hi> Generall, who pretended liberty to
the <hi>Graecians,</hi> but yet held ſome principall Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

And again,<note n="*" place="margin">

ſtocks, but their necke is under the yoke: but
this by the way. The ſame thing is affirmed
every where through the Scripture in equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
termes: Prophets are called <hi>Men of God</hi> in
the Old Teſtament; and <hi>Timothy</hi> in the New
is ſtiled <hi>a Man of God;</hi> and all Apoſtles <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of Ieſus Chriſt, the Servants of God,</hi> and
<hi>Angels of the Churches,</hi> for this reaſon. But
why do I enforce the Text? the truth is plain,
and who is there here that doth not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it? Who is ſuch a freſh Proſelyte in the
Lords familie, that doth not know his cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance,
his livery? As the Diſciples ſaid igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
to <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf, <hi>Art thou only a ſtranger
in Iſrael, and knowest not theſe things?</hi> So it may
be truly ſaid to that Chriſtian, if there be ſuch
an one, Who is ſuch a novice in <hi>Gods</hi> ſchoole,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:220:30"/>
that if he hath but learned the Alphabet of the
language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> cannot tell that they ſpeak
the language of <hi>Canaan? Thou art a Galilean,
thy very ſpeech bewrayes thee,</hi> ſaid the maid to
<hi>Peter:</hi> So may every Chriſtian ſee the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
by his ſpeech, (as <hi>Socrates</hi> did) and know
where they are, and from whom they come: or
if any doe not underſtand them when they tell

they have not an interpreter (as the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch

much uſed, much urged by the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

a good argument, if I had not little time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for better: for though I have not ſuch an
overweening opinion of every Moth-eaten
Manuſcript, as your young and buſie Criticks
ſeeme to have: though I do not ſuperſtitiouſly
admire, and adore every relique, and ragg of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Father, (perhaps of their own getting) as
the Papiſts do: though I know there be ſins of
the forefathers mentioned in Scripture, there
be an old Serpent, an old man, not commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
I wiſt there is <hi>vetuſtas erroris,</hi> as a Father
ſpeakes: there are <hi>veteratores</hi> as well as <hi>veteres,</hi>
and not farre diſtant: to conclude, the <hi>Gibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onites</hi>

conclude, I thinke, that true antiquitie in any

the firſt Text of the Sermon, that <hi>Adam</hi>

aske you any more, but I tell you plainly, that
man is from God. For, behold in theſe truths
not a beame of Divinitie (ſuch as <hi>Plato</hi> ſpied in

for his beame was no more, (the word may
be ambiguous) but a perfect body of Divinity.
Neither is it poſſible that any man ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,

worſhipped them as gods, with Prieſts, and

would give you a ſhort draught of ſome truths,
as they have degenerated into fables, among
the Heathen, I might make them ſeeme with
oce labour more perſpicuous, and more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
for as their unlikeneſſe to themſelves

2. Without any help, <hi>ex parte medii,</hi> no inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations

with downe right blowes: and I could wiſh all
unſaid that hath beene ſpoken, that I might
ſpend my ſelfe wholly in theſe things, but I
muſt touch them briefly. The heart of man is
the moſt free and hard of any thing to worke
upon, and to make an impreſſion and ſtampe
upon this hard heart, this heart that is ſo ſtonie,
Adamantine, <hi>harder then the mother Milſtones,</hi>
as the Scripture teacheth. To compell this
freewill, that <hi>Domina ſui actus,</hi> the Queene in

they mollifie, and wound, and break this heart,
they incline, and bow, and draw this free will
whither the ſpirit liſteth: And <hi>Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus</hi>

boy, and then cauſed him to be opened, and
finding the Arrow in the middeſt of his heart,
he made this argument, that he was no drunken
man, and turning him to the father asked him
(with a cruell ſmile) what he thought of it: O
my Lord (ſaid <hi>Prexaſpes,</hi> betwixt griefe for
his ſonne, and feare for himſelfe:) I think the
gods cannot ſhoote better: I may paralell this

judges, whether I may not well ſay as he did
with a little alteration, O Lord I thinke none
but God, none but thou can ſhoot ſo well.
I conclude this, the Miniſters of the Word are
ſtars in the right hand of God, (as it is in the
<hi>Revelation</hi>) and therefore they dart their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
into the ſecret corners of the ſoule: their

               <p>I can remember but one that gave ſuch te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony

It is more then time to ſhut up this point: brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
therefore, it is abſurd to ſay of naturall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
<hi>Sol &amp; homo generant hominem,</hi> and yet
to thinke of ſpirituall regeneration, that the
ſonne of man can doe it without the ſonne of

that the maſters of that art have delivered in

makes a man aſcend to God, muſt needs have
deſcended from God firſt, and the Conduit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipes,

The ſecond inſtruction followes, for
their doctrine: For this title of Ambaſſadors,
commends many things unto them, as, 1. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie.
Ambaſſadors have a commiſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
which they muſt not go, and I thinke it
is diſputed and determined by Lawyers, that a
Legate may not tranſgreſſe it, though he
might, in probability advantage his maſter

Gods Ambaſſadors, the Word is their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
from which if they ſwerve, the Lord
will commence an Action,<note n="*" place="margin">

Embaſſage, againſt them: And if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
that traditions, and humane inventions,
could gain more glory then this, yet, they that
preſumed to uſe them, might juſtly looke to be
handled as the Triumvirs did the ſervant of a
noble Senator of <hi>Rome,</hi> that betrayed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
whom they had proſcribed: they rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him for his ſervice to them, becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
him who was proſcribed, they proving
him guilty; and then they rewarded him for
his treachery to his maſter, whom he ſhould
have preſerved, they caſt him down headlong
from the Capitoll, and brake his neck. 2. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.
They go for another, they muſt not wo
for themſelves: <hi>Non nobis Domine, non nobis,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:220:54"/>
not unto us O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name
be given all the praiſe and glory,</hi> muſt be their
ſong. They may take up the Embleme that a
noble Lady of <hi>France,</hi> being ſuſpected of a
crime, and not well knowing how to waſh it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
otherwiſe, uſed a watering Pot dropping,
with this Motto, <hi>Nil mihi praeterea, praeterea mihi
nil:</hi> The Miniſters I ſay may well uſe this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
pot, for <hi>Paul may plant, and Apollo wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but it is God that giveth the increaſe.</hi> In a
word, (becauſe I am forced to poſt over theſe
things) as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> having healed a lame
man, that lay at the beautifull gate of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
ſaid to the people that beheld it, and began
to have them in ſome admiration, <hi>Why gaze you
upon us, as if we had done this by our owne power,
&amp;c?</hi> And as the King <hi>Canutus</hi> in our Engliſh
Hiſtorie, tooke off the Crowne from his owne
head, and ſet it upon the Crucifixe at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter:</hi>
So Gods Ambaſſadors, muſt not receive
honour for themſelves, but muſt be like the
Mercuriall Statues to point men the right way
to <hi>Christ.</hi> 3. Diligence, <hi>Curſed be he that doth
the worke of the Lord negligently,</hi> eſpecially they
that are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is Ambaſſadors, they muſt not ſay,

That the nature of their ſervice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
much diligence, and expedition: Their
maſter and their errand, the authority of the
one, the neceſſity of the other, the reward, the
puniſhment, the horrour of the one, the hope
of the other, will compell them to diſcharge
their office, with all poſſible induſtrie. Who
would not runne like a ſtar in perpetuall motion
upon earth, that he might ſhine like a ſtar in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
hereafter, in perpetual reſt and glory but to
leave this, as not ſo proper, <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid wittily
of a ſervant, <hi>Minùs nocet ignavus fur, quàm ſeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis

Foxes that the <hi>Canticles</hi> ſpeaks of that ſteals the
Grapes, do not ſo much hurt, as the idle Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
lazie labourers in the Lords Vineyard.
4. Courage and reſolution againſt all feare or
flattery, <hi>Feare not their faces,</hi> (ſaith the Lord to
<hi>Ieremy) leſt I deſtroy thee. Popilius a Romane</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
to <hi>Antiochus</hi> the great, having deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his meſſage, and the King deferring his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
and demurring on it, drew a circle round
about him with his wand, and conjured him,
to determine, and reſolve, whether he would
have peace or warre, before he went a foot out
of the circle: which wondrous reſolution and
confidence, cauſed him preſently to define,
peace. And doe not we ſee how bold every
petty Conſtable will beare himſelfe upon the
higher power, I charge you in the Kings name,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and why ſhould only Gods Ambaſſadors
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:220:55"/>
like children, be afraid of ſhadowes and bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beares?
The world hath many reproachfull
nicknames for Gods Ambaſſadors, Prieſt, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
Vicar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what ſhould we doe? as he in

of every prophane ſcoffer; away with ſuch ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble,

theſe, we are too too nice and daintie, <hi>Chriſti
nimis delicati martyres,</hi> as one ſpeakes, if wee
thinke the worſe of our ſelves, or of our profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

like curs they barke, becauſe they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of you, they would not have you come

you do well, or as he ſaid plainly, being asked
why they did ſo, <hi>quia malefacere nequeunt.</hi> In the
wilderneſſe, theſe wilde beaſts goe looſe, and
prey upon Gods children: but in this proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of <hi>Sion,</hi> the Law chaines them, and chaines
them ſo, that they cannot hurt, and therefore
they grin the more afarre off. Let them know,

ſpeake of theſe) it is not Throns, nor Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
nor Powers, nor any dignities, that can
make a man ſo truly honourable, as the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Goſpell to poore ſoules, to be Gods
Ambaſſadors, ſurely they are miſtaken, they
need not feare, the frequency in this duty,
ſhould prove a diſparagement or imminution
to greatneſſe. Excellently ſaith our Saviour,
<hi>All power is given unto me both in Heaven
and Earth:</hi> I will now prefer all my ſervants,
and make you Lords and Rulers, but wot yee
how? it followes, <hi>Go preach to all Nations,</hi> but
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:220:58"/>
this, by the way. I conclude this with a
word to ſome, with whom I may be bold. Let
no man here that is in a way to the Miniſtery,
believe the falſe ſpies that raiſe an ill report
upon that good land, that flowes with milk and
honey. I will ſay no more now, but is it thinke
you a baſe thing and ſordid, to be Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
to the King of Heaven? I will repeat it
once more, becauſe I can ſcarce heare without
ſome indignation, that that ſhould be a maxime
in the worlds Heraldrie, for earthly Kings, once
Ambaſſador, ever honourable: And it is a baſe
thing to be Ambaſſadors for the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
And now I come to the third deduction,
concerning the people, which I muſt run over.
I ſhall not need to tell you, that you muſt not
offer any diſcourteſie to theſe Ambaſſadors:
Ambaſſadors are inviolable by the law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
and the Lord hath ſet a better mark then
<hi>Cain</hi> had, and given them a better paſport, <hi>touch
not mine annointed, and do my Prophets no harm:</hi>
And if any ſhould riſe up againſt them, I would
tell them boldly, what one whiſpered in the
Captains eare, when he was ſomthing too buſie
with <hi>Paul, Take heed what thou doeſt, this man is a
Romane:</hi> Take heed what thou doeſt, this man
is an Ambaſſador. The <hi>Romans</hi> ſacked the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Corinth</hi> and razedit to the ground, for a
little diſcourteſie they offer'd to their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors:
And what ſhall the Lord of the Vineyard
doe to thoſe husbandmen, that beat and ſton'd
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:220:58"/>
and killd his ſervants, that he ſends unto them?
It is a ſymptome of a diſordered and deſperate
eſtate. When theſe Ambaſſadors are violated,
we pull all Gods judgements upon our heads,
with the chaines of our ſinnes: but this is the
linke of the chaine that immediately drawes
them. It is a remarkable place, in the laſt of the
<hi>Chronicles, Moreover all the chiefe of the Prieſts
and the people tranſgreſſed very much after all the
abominations of the Heathen, and polluted the houſe
of the Lord, that he hallowed at Ieruſalem:</hi> here be
many links, but obſerve that followes, <hi>And the
Lord God of their Fathers ſent to them by his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers,
riſing up betimes and ſending, becauſe he had
compaſsion on his people, and on his dwelling place.
But they mocked the meſsengers of God, and deſpiſed
his words, and miſuſed his Prophets</hi> (this is the
laſt linke, and ye ſee judgement faſtned, chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and linked to it) <hi>untill the wrath of the Lord
aroſe againſt his people, till there was no remedie.
Therefore he brought upon them the Chaldees, &amp;c.</hi>
I paſſe from this. When <hi>Ehud</hi> told the King of
<hi>Moab, I have a Meſſage to thee from God, O King,
he roſe from his thron and bowed himſelf.</hi> I think
it was <hi>Francis</hi> that ſaid, if he ſhould meet a
Preacher and an Angell together, he would
firſt ſalute the Preacher, and the Angell after.
I am ſure <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of the <hi>Galathians,</hi> that they
received him as an Angell of God, yea as <hi>Ieſus
Chriſt,</hi> and that they would have plucked out
their eyes for him, <hi>how beautifull are the feet of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:220:59"/>
thoſe upon the mountaines that bring the glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of Peace,</hi> ſaith the Church in the Prophet:
the Spouſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſo humble, or modeſt,
or both, that ſhee dares looke no higher then
the feet, and yet ſhe ſpies <hi>beautifull,</hi> written in
the very duſt of their feet (as you have ſeene a
contrary word other where) and that in ſuch le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
characters, that ſhe reads it afar off, before
they come neare her, <hi>upon the mountaines,</hi> as
though it had beene written with a Sun beame
upon ſome Eaſterne hill in a goodly morning:
and thoſe letters printed ſuch affection in her,
that being not able to expreſſe it by art, ſhee
throwes down her penſill, (as you have heard
of the Painter) and expreſſes it with a paſſion,
or rather, ſhe ſhadowes that ſhe could not ſet
forth in a patheticall exclamation: <hi>How beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
are the feet of thoſe upon the mountaines, that
bring glad tydings of peace!</hi> and what ſhe did in
ſpeeches, <hi>Mary</hi> in the Goſpell ſpake in deed,
<hi>ſhe fell downe at the feet of Chriſt, ſhe broke her box
of precious ointment and powred it upon them,</hi> ſhe
let fall a ſhower of more precious tears, (peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
teares are ſomething like to pearls, but that
they are more precious) with which ſhe waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them: ſhe wiped them with a moſt precious
towell, the haires of her head: me thinks theſe
golden haires were like to threads of gold, with
which <hi>Mary</hi> tyed her ſelf (as it were) in a true
lovers knot to her beſt beloved Saviour. Would
you know plainly what entertainment you muſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:220:59"/>
give theſe Ambaſſadors. I will tell you in a
word. Give attention, credit, obedience to their
words: if they thunder and lighten out of
Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> if the Lion roare, let the proudeſt
beaſt in the forreſt quake and tremble: if Mount
<hi>Sion</hi> let fall her ſilver drops, if the ſilver trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
of the Goſpell ſound peace and comfort,
let the pooreſt worm forget that he creeps up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the earth, and think he hath a title to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
I know you long till I make an end, and ſo
do I too. To conclude therefore: I wiſh you
could forget all that hath beene ſpoken, and
blot it out of your memory, to faſten this one
thing which I am now to ſay. Let this be our
remembrance when we go to the Lords houſe,
I go now to heare what Gods Ambaſſadors
ſhall ſay unto me: they that dreſſe themſelves
to go with any colder or baſer conceits, may
well bee checked, as <hi>Caligula</hi> was wont to ſay
tyrannically, what <hi>Antidotum contra Caeſarem:</hi>
and that is a reall crime in them only, which
was a ridiculous accuſation of <hi>Trebonius, Quod
telum toto pectore non exceperit.</hi> Again let this be
our meditation, when we returne from thence,
with benefit, <hi>Bleſſed be thou, and bleſſed be thy
counſell, and bleſſed be the Lord that ſent thee out to
meet me this day:</hi> Surely this is a man of God,
a man of Heaven: tell me, O you that are cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
linguiſts, did he not ſpeak with the tongue
of Angels? was not I in heaven while I heard
him? is it but an imaginary fancie? or did I
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:220:60"/>
heare the more then <hi>Pythagorean</hi> harmony of
the ſphears? His words like Soveraigne balme
dropt into my wounded ſoule, like the ſweet
influence of the <hi>Pleiades</hi> upon this lower world:
me thought, I felt my heart (while he ſpake)
ſhoot up into my eares, as it were to meet and
kiſſe the bleſſed lips, which diſtilled ſuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
dew, ſuch golden ſhowres, and drinke
them as the parched, and thirſty earth the dew
of Heaven: and yet, in the ſweet remembrance
thereof, <hi>My ſoule magnifieth the Lord, and my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
rejoyceth in God my Saviour.</hi> Bleſſed be the
Lord that hath ſent his Angels, (as he did to
<hi>Peter</hi>) to draw me out of the dungeon of ſinne
and miſery, that hath ſent his Ambaſſadors, as
<hi>David</hi> did to <hi>Hanun,</hi> to comfort me. <hi>Signa

And therefore, I pray give me leave to draw
the whole pedegree of my Text by the line of
method, that ſo I may lead your underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:220:65"/>
into the meaning of the words, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
conſtruction, and lead my obſervations
out of the meaning of the words, without any
violent conſequution. Wherein if my diſcourſe
be tedious, I will make no apologie, but this,
neceſſity forced me to ſeeke further then my
Text, and when I was entred, delight perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
me to ſeeke farther then I needed: yet I
reſolved when I had done, not to trouble you
with any thing in this kinde, but then it was too
late, I was compelled by another neceſſity.
Wherefore I muſt intreat you to accept it as it
is. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> like a faithfull labourer
in the Lords Vineyard, had planted a Church
at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and watered it with a whole yeares
Preaching, as it were, ſhowring downe the
ſweet dewes of Heaven upon it. After his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
though he had both his hands full of
other imployments, yet, being jealous of the
ſucceſſe of his labour, both his eyes were
watchfull, if he might by any meanes further
the worke he had begun: being thus deſirous,
there could not want occaſion: For behold ere
long, both his eares are filled with newes from
<hi>Corinth; Thoſe of the houſe of Chloe,</hi> on the one
ſide, welwillers to the welfare of the Church,
have recourſe to him, to informe him of ſome
corruptions wherewith the Church was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled:
for the envious man had ſowne Tares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the good Seed, while the good man was
aſleepe. Thoſe of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> on
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:220:65"/>
the other ſide, make repair to him to be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in ſome queſtions, wherw<hi rend="sup">th</hi> their conſcience
was troubled: for the gracious Lord had bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the labour of his good ſervant in planting
and watering, with a bleſſed increaſe. And thus
you ſee a double occaſion of writing, which
makes a double argument of this golden Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.
Concerning corruptions, to the ſeventh
Chapter, where he fixes a tranſition
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as it were a marke of his paſſage to the
ſecond; which beginning there, holds on to the
end of the Epiſtle concerning queſtions: <hi>Sed
tranſeat iſta.</hi> The corruptions were either
ſuch as were generally committed by all, not
only permitted, as Shiſme, in the 4. Chapter,
or permitted only by all, not generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
as unnaturall inceſt, Chapter 5. unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
quarrels, Chapter 6. Ye ſee then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities
of <hi>Corinth,</hi> overſpreading the whole
face, and overgrowing the whole body of the
Church. All the Governours were guiltie:
The Preachers with their affected eloquence
and ambitious affectation had rent the people
in ſunder, from unity to mutiny, from faith to
faction. The whole Presbyterie was tardie in
their dutie, inceſt, horrible inceſt was among
them, the ſhame of the Church, the ſcorn of
the Gentiles, the ſcandall of the Chriſtians, in
ceſt, horrible inceſt was among them, jetting
in their ſtreets, and yet they ſee it not, or wink
at it, crying to Heaven and was heard; and yet
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:220:66"/>
their ſword ſleeps in his ſcabbard and cannot
be awaked. See yet further, they are but a little
handfull, hemmed in with enemies round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
who watch them with a thouſand eyes,
and yet they cannot leave wrangling among
themſelves, they muſt needs hale one another
to the judgement ſeates, and there in a goodly
Theater ſet themſelves, Themſelves? nay, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
the precious word of God, the joy, glory,
aud jewell of a Chriſtian, for which, a mans life
were not deare, if he bought it ſo: I ſay, they ſet
the Goſpell to ſale, to the deriſion of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.
Theſe then were the maladies of <hi>Corinth,
Schiſme</hi> broken out with <hi>arrogancie,</hi> and not
bound up with <hi>humility: Inceſt</hi> committed by
<hi>villany,</hi> and not controlled by <hi>authority: law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutes</hi>
proſecuted at Heathen courts, and not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up with Chriſtian care: and <hi>Paul</hi> like a
skilfull Phyſitian, applies Doſes to theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.
Inceſt muſt be cured by cutting; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
caution, may prevent unchriſtian conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
but Schiſme is a longer task; that ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
humour of pride and vaine-glory, muſt be
abaſed and abated with the ſpare diet of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
mind, a ſimple meaning, and a ſyncere
manner in the Preaching of the Word, that ſo
the glory of God may be advanced, and all the
pride of man trampled in the duſt.</p>
               <p>The argument of Schiſme is continued from
the 10. of the 1. to the end of the 4. Chapter,
where a double courſe, uſed in the cure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
is intimated.</p>

1. That which he <hi>premiſes.</hi> 2. That which
he <hi>promiſes.</hi> He premiſes this Letter ſent by the
hand of <hi>Timothy,</hi> that he might further the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe:
and promiſes, that if this will not doe,
himſelfe will ſhortly come and take further
order.</p>
               <p>The ſumme of the Letter is an exhortation
to unitie from one argument eſpecially, and is
couched and concluded in this Enthymeme,
<hi>You are all one in Chriſt Ieſus who is one, you agree
with one mind, and one mouth:</hi> the Propoſition
being ſuppoſed as very reaſonable, and therfore
ſuppreſſed as not very neceſſary. The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is propoſed in the tenth of the firſt, where
becauſe it ſtands (as it were) in the forefront
without the premiſes, it is guarded on the one
ſide with a ſweet entreatie, <hi>I beſeech you brethren:</hi>
on the other ſide with a ſound authority, <hi>By the
name of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> being (as it were)
edged with the one, the ſweet entreatie; and
backed with the other, the ſound authority, that
it might the better peirce into the very tower
of their affections; and force them with a ſure
charme to all ſyncere obedience, and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
iterated in the 14. of the 4. cloſes up
the whole argument.</p>
               <p>The Aſſumption follows in the 13. of the 1.
whetted, as it were, and pointed, with nimble
interrogations, which all ſpeake as Spaniards
in the language of Pike, with invincible po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
and unavoidable neceſſity, that <hi>Chriſt</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:220:67"/>
is the onely one, and undivided Saviour.</p>
               <p>But here the <hi>Corinthians</hi> barre up the way
with an objection, which is inſinuated in the
12. verſe, and is but inſinuated in the whole
progreſſe: yet ſo, that you may eaſily perceive
that all <hi>Pauls</hi> paines in the foure firſt Chapters,
is ſpent in the remoovall of this rub, the antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of this objection: Now this it is.</p>
               <p>Though there be but one <hi>Christ,</hi> one Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
yet there be many of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Miniſters, and
they have different gifts; one likes <hi>Pauls</hi> ſimple
perſpicuitie; others, <hi>Apollos</hi> ample plentie; a
third, <hi>Cephas</hi> ſolid potency; and therefore, why
may not I apply my ſelf to <hi>Paul,</hi> I, to <hi>Apollo,</hi>
I, to <hi>Cephas?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This their diſcourſe (if you marke it) is a
diſcovery of all the cauſes of their diſorder.
They are two: the <hi>bewitching tongues</hi> of the
teachers, and, the <hi>itching eares</hi> of the people:
the teachers arrogance, the peoples ignorance.
The teachers, faithleſſe teachers, wooe for
themſelves, inſtead of their Lord: the people,
fooliſh people, fall in love with the man, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of the maſter, the ſervant, inſtead of the
ſoveraigne: And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> inſtructs them
both: the teachers, what they ſhould do, from
the 14. of the 1. to the 5. of the 3. where im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
an occaſion, he ſweetly paſſes to the
people, what they ſhould doe: the people
muſt not account too highly of their Miniſters,
for two reaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:220:67"/>
1. They are but the <hi>Lords ſervants.</hi> They
may well take up the embleme of a watering-Pot
dropping, with this word, <hi>Nil mihi praete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,
praeterea mihi nil. For Paul may plant, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo
may water, but it is the Lord that gives the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</hi>
And therefore they muſt not ſet up the
labourer againſt the Lord.</p>
               <p>Nay ſecondly, the Miniſters, they are the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi>
ſervants in the Lord, <hi>For all things are
yours, whether Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, or the world
or life, or death, or things preſent, or things to come,
all are yours, and ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi>
And therefore, you muſt not make them lords
of your faith: and therefore, <hi>Let no man glory in
men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the Miniſters duty. It is not to
ſeeke themſelves, but the glory of God, and
the good of the people; and therefore, not to
preach themſelves in quaint words, and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
eloquence, but to preach both for <hi>matter,
Christ Ieſus;</hi> and for <hi>manner, with all plainneſſe,</hi>
and without all affectation, nothing but <hi>Chriſt
Ieſus</hi> with all humility, and without all oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
nothing but <hi>Chriſt Ieſus crucified. Chriſt
Ieſus,</hi> muſt be the argument of their preaching,
for in him God will be glorified: <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi>
muſt be the ornament of their preaching, that
<hi>he that glorieth may glory in the Lord.</hi> This is
the Summe of that which is laid downe at
length in <hi>Pauls</hi> example: his ſtory reports both
the fact that he did ſo, and the cauſes, both ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficients,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:220:68"/>
and ends: efficients, <hi>God</hi> peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commanding, <hi>Paul</hi> voluntarily obeying <hi>God</hi>
as a royall Soveraigne, <hi>Paul</hi> as a loyall ſubject,
<hi>God imperio, Paul obſequio;</hi> both which have
their ends the ſame, to wit, the glory of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
God, and the eternall good of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians:</hi>
yet with this different diſtinction,
<hi>God</hi> independently, <hi>Paul</hi> in dependency; <hi>God</hi>
as ſupreme head preſcribing, <hi>Paul</hi> as ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
ſubſcribing to his holy pleaſure: and with
this diſpoſition <hi>God</hi> intending his glory, is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
treated of in the firſt Chapter, <hi>Paul</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
the peoples good, ſpecially propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in this Chapter. This is the <hi>ſeries rei,</hi> but
the <hi>ſeries hiſtoriae</hi> conſiſts in three ſteps.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>God</hi> commanded <hi>Paul,</hi> and all, ſo to do,
from the 17. verſe of the 1. to the end.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Paul</hi> determined ſo to doe, in the verſe
of my Text.</p>
               <p>3. He did ſo, in the firſt verſe, for thus they
lie in order: and therefore you muſt obſerve
two things for the method.</p>
               <p>1. That the firſt verſe of this Chapter
holds hands with the 17. of the 1. and all
which is inſerted, is but a commoration in
the ſtorie, illuſtrating the command of God
from the cauſe of his counſell, and the contrary
conceit of the worldlings.</p>
               <p>2. That the order of the two latter parts in
his determination and action inverted, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
placed after the 1. verſe, which in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:220:68"/>
method, ſhould have had the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie.</p>
               <p>To contract all that hath beene ſaid: two
things may be obſerved here, a <hi>Precept,</hi> and an
<hi>Example.</hi> The Precept is a deſcription of a
Miniſter of the Goſpell, to be ſuch an one, as
now being ſent of God, is to preach the glad
tydings of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> come into the World,
for the redemption of mankinde, for the glory
of God, and the ſalvation of his people: This
deſcription containes the chiefe cauſes, as is
ſhewed. The example is <hi>Paul,</hi> in whom, as
in a glaſſe, all this is repreſented, for three
Reaſons.</p>
               <p>1. For <hi>Pauls own ſake,</hi> to vindicate his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie
with the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> inveigled with
their Rabbinicall Doctors, and thence offended
with <hi>Pauls</hi> ſimplicitie, began to call in queſtion:
as you may ſee.</p>
               <p>2. For the <hi>Doctors ſake,</hi> that if they would
not learne their duty from God, they might
learne it from him, ſo lofty a patterne, of ſo
lowly a pietie: as you may ſee.</p>
               <p>3. For the <hi>Corinthians ſake,</hi> to provoke them
to a filiall imitation, by the patriall example of
his humilitie.</p>
               <p>To draw now to a concluſion. You ſee the
<hi>context</hi> is a Commentary upon the <hi>Text:</hi> and
the <hi>Text</hi> is a Compendium of the <hi>context;</hi> for
the Text is a recapitulation of all the ſeveralls
above mentioned, the very quinteſſence of all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:220:69"/>
the ſimples afore unfolded: and the Context
is a light diſcovering what is contained in the
Text, both for words and meaning, and what
may be collected out of the Text, for inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The words may now be eaſily interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:

                  </gap> muſt be rendred by a Metonymy of
the Cauſe for the Effect, by the word Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
not ſo much as know, even as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

or in competition. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is a
Synechdoche, for all that was to be taught
concerning <hi>Christ Ieſus,</hi> namely, faith in him,
and ſalvation by him; even as the laſt words
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, comprehend all his ſufferings
in generall, of which, this is a ſpecies <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
The meaning then is, as if <hi>Paul</hi> had ſaid, <hi>I
thought nothing worthy to be knowne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
determined to make ſhew of no other knowledg
among you, but of the counſell of God, for your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
by a true faith in Chriſt Ieſus, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was crucified for you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being the meaning, you ſee what this
verſe containes in it, namely, a generall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
and a ſpeciall example, a generall precept
in a ſpeciall example. <hi>The generall precept</hi> is,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:220:69"/>
that every Miniſter muſt preach, for matter,
<hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> only; for manner, with all humility
<hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> crucified: this is in the Text, and
the context, as a Commentary, ſhews why this
muſt be done, from the efficients.</p>
               <p>1. God he commands.</p>
               <p>2. The Miniſter, it is his duty to obey. And
from the ends.</p>
               <p>1. He muſt ſeeke Gods glory, not his owne
applauſe.</p>
               <p>2. He muſt ſeeke the peoples ſalvation, not
his owne approbation.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, it ſhewes what is here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
all humane wiſdome and humane elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
which tend any way to ſelfe ſeeking,
and, therefore all theſe doctrines are plainly
contained in this precept, beſide what may be
collected: as.</p>
               <p>1. That the only way to ſeeke Gods glory and the
ſalvation of the people, is by teaching Chriſt Ieſus,
and him Crucified, and him only: <hi>and therefore,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That we can hardly preach in humane e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence
and wiſdome, but we ſhall be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of bewraying our owne vainglory, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
the Lords honour, and the ſoules of
his people.</p>
               <p>3. The preaching in humility, is the beſt
way to prevent Schiſmes in charity.</p>
               <p>Now all theſe are made more illuſtrious
in a moſt illuſtrious example, to which every
word in the Text payes tribute, that it may be
excellent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:220:70"/>
1. <hi>Paul</hi> did not ſeek the wiſdome of words,
to ſeeke his owne worſhip; and therefore no
mans greatneſſe, or learning, no exemption can
priviledge, no priviledge can exempt any man
from this neceſſary humilitie: for if any, then
might <hi>Paul</hi> have pretended this, who was
brought up at <hi>Gamaliels</hi> feet, and accompliſhed
with all humane inſtitution, who was rapt
into the third heavens, and acquainted with all
divine revelations: and that you may not think,
that ignorance in letters, was the mother of
this devotion to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he was at <hi>Lyſtry</hi> taken
for a god, even for <hi>Mercurie,</hi> the god of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence:
yet <hi>Paul</hi> did it not: yea.</p>
               <p>2. He ſhaked off all tickling inticements;
and ſhunned all inducements, for he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
not to doe it: yea.</p>
               <p>3. He determined not ſo much as to know
any thing beſide <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>dele
de hinc ex animo,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and
ſurely, if we make an anatomie of the whole
body of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, you ſhall find, <hi>Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Crucified,</hi> written in the heart of them, in
golden characters, as truly, as they falſly report
that they were ſeene in the heart of <hi>Ignatius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Marke the word, not any thing, not a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
not a tittle of any thing, but <hi>Chriſt Ieſus Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:</hi>
and yet we have not done, for behold yet
a further wonder.</p>
               <p>5. He would not know any thing, no not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> if any where, then ſurely
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:220:70"/>
he might have ſhewed learning and eloquence
at <hi>Corinth,</hi> a City of <hi>Greece,</hi> a famous City, a
learned City, where they could underſtand,
and did expect it, and, as it ſeems, and as I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before, were offended with his homlineſſe:
yet all this could not draw <hi>Paul</hi> from his
charge, no more then they could draw the Sun
from his Charriot. Me thinkes, I ſee the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi>
amazed at the hearing of the firſt
verſe, to ſee that <hi>Paul</hi> ſo lightly eſteemed, that
which they ſo highly admired, and aſſaulting
him in this manner.</p>
               <p>It was once ſaid, much learning, ô <hi>Paul,</hi> hath
made thee mad; but now much love hath made
thee mad. When we heare of a meſſenger from
<hi>God,</hi> we look'd to have ſeen one cloathed, clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with the Moon, crowned with a Crown of
Stars, and lookt thou ſhouldeſt have ſpoken in
the language of heaven, with the tongue of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:
but ſee what it is, a ſilly ſimple man, in a
ſilly ſimple manner, ſomething like <hi>Archimedes,</hi>
naked, and yet as earneſt in crying <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
as though it were ſome great matter, and yet
upon tryall we find nothing, but Croſſe, and
fooliſhneſſe, the fooliſhneſſe of Preaching, and
the word of the Croſſe; in a word, nothing but
<hi>Christ Ieſus Crucified:</hi> is this the majeſtie of
Gods word? is this the eloquence of Gods Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador?
or rather may not we ſay, as he ſaid
once, much learning hath made thee mad; may
not we ſay, much love hath made thee mad?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:220:71"/>
But here doth <hi>Paul</hi> anſwer. I am not mad,
ô Noble <hi>Corinthians,</hi> but if you will needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
me of my duty neglected to my Lord, I
charge you tell him (what ſhall you tell him?)
I charge you tell him, that I am ſicke of love.
Neither can I ſee what you can blame in my
preaching, you cannot call it raſhneſſe, for I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined;
you cannot call it rudeneſſe, for I
might have done otherwiſe, if I had not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
determined; or ſay it were both rude and
raſh, yet you may ſtay the cenſure, for,
<q>—Si crimen erat, crimen amoris erat.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For it was among you, it was for your good:
and if all this will not ſatisfie you, yet becauſe
it was <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> I preached, I am well ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the loſſe of eſtimation, and the leaving
of eloquence, for I count all things loſſe, for the
excellent knowledge ſake of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> my
Lord: for whom I have ſuffered the loſſe of
all things, and doe count them but dung that
I may winn <hi>Chriſt:</hi> O noble Apoſtle! noble
<hi>Paul!</hi> would God not only all we here preſent,
but all the Lords ſervants were like thee in all
things, like in this eſpecially, to count nothing
worthy to be knowne, but <hi>Chriſt Ieſus and him
Crucified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much for the entrance into this
Text, which I therefore made choiſe of, to
dedicate my firſt entrance into the Lords ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
becauſe it is the ſumme of all Religion,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:220:71"/>
the ſumme of all, the deſire of <hi>Paul</hi> here, and
of all Chriſtians, and the ſumme of my deſire:
for I count all things loſſe, for the excellent
knowledge ſake of <hi>Christ Ieſus</hi> my Lord, for
whom I could ſuffer the loſſe of all things, and
do count them but dung, that I may win <hi>Chriſt;
For I determined</hi> (and therefore wonder not at

two things out of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and
thoſe both of ſpeciall conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
1. <hi>Quid docendum:
What is the dutie of every Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
2. Quid diſcendum: What
is the duty of every man.</hi> The duty of every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
is expreſly implyed, in the particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Pauls</hi> determination: the duty of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man is directly deduced by an eaſie conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
out of the nature of Relation. For if
the dutie of the teacher be to teach <hi>Christ,</hi> and
nothing but <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as it appeares in <hi>Paul, who
determined to know nothing, but Chriſt Ieſus, and
him Crucified:</hi> then the duty of the learner can
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:220:72"/>
be nothing elſe, but to <hi>learne to know Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
and him crucified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Miniſters duty is more naturall to the
ſcope of the Text: the duty of every man is
more generall in the order of nature; ſo that
they may both challenge and ſtrive for the
precedency. Therefore I determined to take
an indifferent courſe: The laſt time I handled
the former, ſo farre as it made for the clearing
of the Text, but deſcended not to any ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
wherein I pointed only what was the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the Miniſter, generally out of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,
particularly in the words.</p>
               <p>And leaſt any man ſhould object, that <hi>Paul</hi>
indeed did thus, but we are not pinned to his
ſleeve, we live not by examples, <hi>&amp; nos habemus
Spiritum Sanctum,</hi> I ſhewed how his example
did conteine, not only a <hi>precept</hi> concerning the
argument of preaching, but alſo an argument
to provoke us to the obſervation of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.
For it was,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was brought up at <hi>Gamaliels</hi>
feet, <hi>rapt up into the third heaven,</hi> taken for a
<hi>god at Lyſtra,</hi> even <hi>Mercurie</hi> the god of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
if <hi>Paul</hi> then be exemplified for this
humble vaine of preaching, who then is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted?</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Paul</hi> did it not out of <hi>rudeneſſe,</hi> or <hi>raſhneſſe,</hi>
but he <hi>deliberated</hi> what was beſt to be done, and
<hi>determined of this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. He <hi>determined not ſo much as to know,</hi> as if
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:220:73"/>
he ſhould ſay, <hi>deleo dehinc ex animo omnes,</hi>

               <p>4. Not to know <hi>any thing,</hi> not a <gap reason="foreign">

this concluſion.</p>
               <p>That if Paul upon theſe termes would not, then
no Miniſter, upon any termes must preach any

               <p>And thus much I thought good to premiſe
concerning the firſt, <hi>Quid docendum,</hi> what is the
duty of every Miniſter, becauſe it ſeemes to be
ſomthing more ſpecially intended in the verſe:
now I come to the ſecond.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quid diſcendum, What is the duty of every
man,</hi> which I will proſecute, becauſe it is more
generally extended in uſe: or rather I come to
the Doctrine which is common to both, and
out of which both of them are derived. The
Doctrine is this.</p>
               <p>That the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus crucified, is
ſufficient to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Which in a word juſtifies both <hi>Pauls</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
as a reaſon, and warrants <hi>Calvins</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
for the duty both of Preacher and
People, as a ground and foundation: therefore
ſeeing the whole frame of this building lies
upon it, it will not be amiſſe to take a ſpeciall
view of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:220:73"/>
The riſe of this Doctrine out of theſe words
is evident: for if <hi>Paul</hi> who was ſent by God to
preach ſalvation to thoſe that believe, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to preach nothing among them but <hi>Ieſus
Chriſt</hi> and him crucified, then either that was
ſufficient to that end, or els it muſt needs be, that
he either <hi>weakly conceived</hi> of the means, and ſo
was <hi>unskilfull;</hi> or <hi>wilfully concealed</hi> ſome part of
them, and ſo was <hi>unfaithfull</hi> in his office; but
it were blaſphemy to ſay ſo; for, as for his fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
he was not inferiour to the greateſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;
and as for his fidelitie, <hi>he revealed to them
the whole will of God:</hi> and this very place, (ſo
eminent it was) propounds him as an exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
patterne: and therefore I thinke it is firme
out of this place, <hi>That the knowledge of Chriſt
Ieſus crucified is ſufficient to ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that we may the more diſtinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of this truth, I will endeavour to cleare
theſe two things.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That</hi> Chriſt Ieſus is a ſufficient Saviour.</p>
               <p>2. That <hi>faith</hi> (for this I underſtand here
by knowledge) <hi>is ſufficient to make him our
Saviour:</hi> For theſe two things muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in our ſalvation, the <hi>appretiation,</hi> (that I
may ſo ſpeak) and the <hi>appropriation,</hi> the <hi>gift,</hi> and
the <hi>conveyance,</hi> and both theſe are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in that propoſition: for, <hi>Christ</hi> crucified is
the price paid, which is made ours by faith,
when his ſpirit enlightening our minds to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
his mercy, and inclining our wils to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:220:74"/>
imbrace it, unites us to our Saviour: and if
there be any defect in the ſufficiencie, it muſt
needs be, either becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Saviour, or, becauſe faith is not ſufficient
to make him our Saviour: but neither of theſe
can be.</p>
               <p>1. For the firſt, <hi>That Chriſt is a ſufficient Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour:</hi>
I will firſt point out what Salvation is:
and ſecondly, prove that <hi>Christ</hi> hath wrought
it ſufficiently.</p>
               <p>1. By <hi>Salvation,</hi> I meane the <hi>Summum bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
the utmoſt end, the <hi>chief happineſse</hi> of man,
which cannot conſiſt in any thing in the world,
ſave in his <hi>conjunction and conformity with his
Creator:</hi> For the Lord made all things for
man, and man for himſelfe. Indeed he imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the <hi>veſtigia</hi> of his power, and wiſdome,
and all his Attributes, in the glorious worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip
of the World; but as for all other
creatures, though they contain the arguments
of his praiſe, written in golden Letters, yet
they have no eye to read them, though they
obey the word of his will, for he did but ſay,
<hi>let it be ſo, and it was ſo,</hi> yet it was without a free
and voluntarie obedience; therefore it pleaſed
God to create man, who might glorifie him in
the <hi>carefull obſervation of his wiſdome,</hi> written in
the volume of his workes, and in the chearfull
<hi>obſervance of his will</hi> ingraven in the table of his
heart; and for this cauſe was he made, as he
was the <hi>image of God,</hi> in ſcience and ſanctitie;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:220:74"/>
and on this condition was he made the Lord of
all the creatures, that in their names that could
not, he might that could, offer the tribute of
praiſe to his Lord and Maker. And this was
the reaſon, that man was the laſt of all his
workes, as though all proceeded from him, but
ended in man, and man only ſtood betweene
them and God, receiving all the profit of them
with the one hand, and re-delivering all the
praiſe of them with the other hand, into the
hands of the Lord. This then was the end of
man, in the obſervation of his wiſdome, and
the obſervance of his will to glorifie God, and
this ſhould have beene his honour, and his
happineſſe.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you doe not well underſtand yet
what I meane by Salvation; neither indeed can
you well underſtand it, till you have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>ſtate that man now is in:</hi> and therefore I
pray give me leave to touch it briefly.</p>
               <p>I ſay then that every man of us, every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſonne is born by nature a veſſell of wrath,
a vaſſall of Satan, an enemy to God, and all
goodneſſe. If you aske me whence this comes,
I anſwer as <hi>Chriſt</hi> in another caſe, <hi>Ab initio
non fuit ſic:</hi> for as I told you before, and now
tell you againe, Man was created the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
piece of this goodly frame, a Citizen of
Heaven, Inhabitant of Paradiſe, Brother of the
Angels, Lord of the Creatures, Sonne of the
Almightie, even the glorious image of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:220:75"/>
Lord of glory, the lively picture of the living
God, his body being graced with many orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and his ſoule adorned with many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
ſo that Heaven and Earth might ſeeme to
have beene maried in his making.</p>
               <p>Now, then man was no ſooner made but he
rebelled againſt his maker, he that was right,
was fat and kicked againſt his Lord, and we in
him:<note place="margin">

that is good, our <hi>nature</hi> catcht a fall, like <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiboſheth,</hi>
in the cradle of her infancie, and we

<hi>bodies</hi> are ſubject to <hi>deformities, infirmities,
death,</hi> our <hi>ſoules and bodies</hi> to the <hi>wrath of God,</hi>
which lies heavie upon us here, proſecuting us
with armies of plagues, and will never leave us
till it hath brought us (unleſſe his mercy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent

               <p>No marvaile then, if <hi>Plato</hi> complaine that

if they who had but one eye ſaw theſe things,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:220:75"/>
even through the cloudes of obſcuritie: I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
rather, that among Chriſtians, who have
both their eyes, the <hi>eye of reaſon,</hi> and the <hi>eye of
faith,</hi> and beſides, live in the Sunneſhine of the
Goſpell, ſo few ſee this, as they did, or at leaſt,
the reaſon of this, which they could not.</p>
               <p>I marvaile I heare no more cry out with
S. <hi>Paul, O miſerable man that I am, who ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
me from this body of death!</hi> for if <hi>Paul</hi> ſo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically
cryed out, who could ſo triumphant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give thanks; how much more juſtly may we,
if we cannot adde that which follows, reiterate
the ſame againe, and ſay? <hi>O miſerable man that I
am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ye ſee now the miſery of a naturall man,
conſiſting in the <hi>conſcience of ſinne,</hi> and the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of ſinne,</hi> the <hi>fault</hi> and the <hi>guilt, malum
culpae, malum poenae:</hi> this is the miſerie of man,
which eſtranges him farre from the ſtate of
happines: and out of this ye may gather what
ſalvation is. For every Salve ſuppoſes a Sore,
and the ſore is ſinne and paine, and therefore
the ſalve is that which will free us from this
horrible condition: and reſtore, and re-eſtate us
into the favour of the Lord, and ſo into our
former felicitie. This is that which I meane by
Salvation.</p>
               <p>And thus am I falne into the ſecond point,
<hi>That Chriſt is a ſufficient Saviour.</hi> The Sunne
ſhines not ſo cleare in his ſtrength, as this truth
I hope ſhall ſhine, though through my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:220:76"/>
for, to let paſſe all that might bee
alleadged for it, and to make uſe of thoſe
grounds onely, which have beene laid already.
Yet it will be more then evident: for as you
heard, Salvation is the redeeming us from that
miſerable condition, in which by nature we lie
plunged moſt deſervedly, and reſtoring us to
that happy ſtate which we ſhould have enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
had we continued in our integrity: But
<hi>Christ Ieſus</hi> hath performed both theſe for us:
therefore he is a ſufficient Saviour. The proofe
of the Propoſition was provided for before:
the Aſſumption I will make good in the parts.
For firſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath redeemed us from all our
miſery, whether ſinne, the roote, or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the fruit be conſidered.</p>
               <p>1. He hath taken away <hi>all ſinne,</hi> both our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall
impuritie, by the originall purity of
his manhood, which was therefore ſanctified
in his conception, by the worke of the Holy
Ghoſt, that it might be exempted from the
common condition of corruption; and our
actuall impietie, by the actuall obſervance of
the whole Law of God. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> could
not take him tripping in a word, though they
laid many traines to intrap him. The <hi>High
Prieſts</hi> could lay nothing to his charge, though
they hired falſe witneſſes againſt him. <hi>Pilate</hi>
himſelfe was conſtrained, through the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie
of his cauſe, <hi>ceremonially</hi> to juſtifie him
by waſhing his hands, though he were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:220:76"/>
through the importunitie of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<hi>judicially</hi> to proceed againſt him, and ſo
ſpill blood guiltleſſe. Thus was <hi>Chriſt Ieſus
the Lambe without ſpot, the Iſraelite without guile,
fairer then the children of men,</hi> that ſo he might
take away the pollution of our nature, with
which we were wholly defiled. And this was
his active obedience, wherein hee did that
which we ſhould have done, but could not, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
fulfilling even the rigorous exaction of
all Gods Commandements.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Puniſhment of ſinne</hi> he tooke away
likewiſe by ſuffering and overcomming that
which we muſt have ſuffered, but could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome,
even the full viols of Gods wrath,
and the weight of his hand, the heavie weight
of his heavie wrath, which was due to us for
our offences: for he tooke not on him <hi>our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
only, but the <hi>infirmities of our nature:</hi> hee
that was <hi>rich</hi> became <hi>poore</hi> for our ſakes, that
we which were <hi>poore</hi> might be made <hi>rich:</hi> hee
that was <hi>cloathed with majeſtie</hi> as with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
became <hi>naked,</hi> that we might be decked
with the <hi>robes of his righteouſneſſe:</hi> he that was
<hi>annointed with the oile of gladneſse above his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
wept;</hi> that all teares might be wiped
from our eyes: he whoſe throne was in the
Heavens, wandred and <hi>had not whereon to reſt his
head,</hi> that he might lead us, who had loſt our
ſelves in the Labyrinth of ſinne, to eternall reſt,
and fix us like ſtarres in the Firmament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:220:77"/>
Doe you believe in him for theſe things (as
he once ſaid to <hi>Nathaniel</hi>) follow me a little
with your attention, and you ſhall ſee greater
things then theſe: For he tooke upon him the
chaſtiſements of our ſinnes, and bare the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of our iniquities: he was <hi>accuſed,</hi> that wee
might be <hi>acquitted;</hi> he was <hi>condemned,</hi> that wee
might be <hi>condoned;</hi> he was <hi>accurſed,</hi> that wee
might be <hi>acquitted;</hi> he was <hi>hanged</hi> upon the
<hi>Croſſe</hi> and accounted a ſinner, that our ſinnes
might be croſſed out of the booke of accounts,
and we might be accounted holy and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and wholly righteous. <hi>Who now ſhall lay
any thing to the charge of Gods elect?</hi> Take a view
of all the enemies, they were three, like the
three ſonnes, all terrible Gyants, terrible to all
the ſonnes of <hi>Adam, Sinne, Death,</hi> and <hi>Hell.
If the Lord had not beene on our ſide, may we now
ſay, if the Lord had not beene on our ſide, they had
ſwallowed us up quicke:</hi> But thanks be to God in
<hi>Chriſt Ieſus, the net is broken, and we are eſcaped,</hi>
and behold, <hi>they are dead that ſought our lives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Divell, like a <hi>Serpent in the Garden,</hi> ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Adam</hi> to ſinne; and Sinne, like a <hi>Serpent in
the Wilderneſſe,</hi> ſtung <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the death: but our
Saviour hath overcome them all: he tamed the
Serpent in the wilderneſſe, that tempted <hi>Adam</hi>
in the Garden to ſinne: and he tooke out the
ſting of ſinne, the Serpent of the Deſart, by the
<hi>deſert</hi> of his ſuffering: for ſinne was the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and the ſting of ſin was death, and death
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:220:77"/>
he vanquiſhed in the grave, even in his owne
denne, even on his owne dunghill. So that if
death ſhould now reaſon that he hath us ſtill in
captivitie, becauſe he hath us ſtill in keeping,
we may ſay as <hi>Tully</hi> once to <hi>Atticus, O mors,
ubi eſt acumen tuum?</hi> or rather as S. <hi>Paul</hi> prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pteth
us, <hi>O death, where is thy ſting? ô grave, where
is thy victorie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus was <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Lambe ſltaine,</hi> the
price paid, the propitiatory ſacrifice for his
choſen: and this was his <hi>paſsive obedience,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he ſuffered and overcame that which we
ſhould have ſuffered, but could not have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
ſatisfying even the rigorous exaction
of Gods exact juſtice: and theſe are both the
parts of the payment, which he tendred up to
God in our behalfe and for our behoofe: by
which he hath not only freed us from our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
miſery, which was the firſt part of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and hath beene ſhewed hitherto, but
hath alſo filled us with all good things, which,
as the former, conſiſts in two things, <hi>Holineſſe,</hi>
and <hi>Happineſse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath furniſhed us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
out of the rich ſtorehouſe of his merits; for
what he did he did for us, and we are righteous
in his righteouſneſſe; and what he merited, for
us he merited; and we are victorious in his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie:
in a word, he hath cloathed us with an
undefiled immaculate<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>And if any man doubt yet of the ſufficiency
of his ſatisfaction, weighing the heinouſneſſe
of our tranſgreſſion: let that man conſider but
who it was that did theſe things, and what the
things were that he did and ſuffered, and then
I hope he ſhall be ſufficiently ſatisfied. It was
the <hi>Lord of glory</hi> that <hi>emptied himſelfe into the

<hi>ſhed his precious blood</hi> for us: he <hi>humbled</hi> himſelf

deſcended out of the boſome of bleſſedneſſe,
into the bottome of baſeneſſe: and therefore
needes muſt his paſſion be very meritorious,
whoſe perſon was ſo magnificent: his deſert
muſt needs be great, whoſe deſcent was ſo
glorious.</p>
               <p>Neither need any man doubt of Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation:
for beſide that which hath beene
ſaid, that what he did, and what he ſuffered, it
was for us, becauſe he was man: he tooke not
the nature of Angels upon him, but of man;
and it was ſufficient, becauſe hee was God,
which adds infinite value to both: beſide this,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:220:78"/>
I ſay, who could be ſo fit to reconcile man to
God, as he who was both God and man? Man,
<hi>quia ſolus Deus ſentire;</hi> God, <hi>quia ſolus homo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perare
non potuit mortem quam pro nobis obire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buit:</hi>
yea, and it was the counſell of the Lord,
that this ſhould be the meanes to bring this to
paſſe, and therefore hee laid his wrath upon
him, which otherwiſe had beene injuſtice: his
wrath, I ſay, ſo heavily upon him, that it wrung
out ſtrange words, <hi>My God, my God, why hast
thou forſaken me?</hi> and therefore, he that accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him a ſinner for our ſakes, muſt needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of the ſacrifice that he offer'd for our ſins.</p>
               <p>Now when I review all that I have ſaid for
his ſufficiency, me thinks I need not have gone
further off my text, for demonſtration of this
truth; for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he determined to know
nothing but <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> and him crucified:
therefore he is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and crucified,
therefore he is an alſufficient Saviour: for theſe
three, like the three termes of a Syllogiſme,
draw in a demonſtrative Concluſion: like the
three tongues that were written upon the
Croſſe, Greeke, Latine, Hebrew, to witneſſe
<hi>Christ</hi> to be the King of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> doe each of

this will ſuffice to have ſpoken of his ſufficiencie.</p>
               <p>I come now to the ſecond point, <hi>That Faith is
ſufficient to make him our Saviour:</hi> which I will
handle according to my former order, but exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
briefly. 1. What faith is, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the true
ſence of our own miſery by nature, and ſweet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of Gods mercy offered, an humble
denyall of our ſelves, and all creatures, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
relying on the mercy of the Lord in <hi>Christ
Ieſus:</hi> This may ſerve for a weake delineation of
that worthy grace, framed according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of my former principles.</p>
               <p>And that this is ſufficient, needs no more proof,
but to point at that which ye have heard already:
for ſeeing our Salvation muſt be wrought by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and he that wrought it is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> what can be
further requiſite, then that <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his merits
be made ours, which can be done by faith only:
beſide which, there can be no other affection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
God and man: for the Spirit of God is
the bond that unites and knits us to <hi>Chriſt</hi> by faith:
and faith is the hand that receives the treaſure of
<hi>Chriſts</hi> merits, that inrich us: and <hi>Chriſt</hi> is all our
riches: for being once tranſplanted out of the old
<hi>Adam,</hi> and ingrafted into the new, which is <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
and made one with him, the Lord cannot chuſe
but repute us righteous, through the imputation of
his righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:220:81"/>
Hence it is, that all our ſinnes are remitted and
blotted out of the booke of remembrance, and our
ſelves re-admitted into his favour, and into his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily:
hence it is, that we are adopted to be his
ſonnes, and adorned with his ſonnes holineſſe:
hence it is, that the curſe of our ſinnes is take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and we have peace with God and all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
the Angels pitch their Tents about us, and
the ſtones of the field are in league with us: for it
is written, <hi>He hath given his Angels charge over
us, to preſerve us in all our wayes, leaſt at any time
we ſhould hurt our foot againſt a ſtone:</hi> hence it is, that
<hi>the old man, with the luſts of the ſame, dye in us, and
decay, and the new man is renewed daily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoone as we begin to believe in the Lord <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
the ſcales fall from our eyes, that we can not
only read in the book of the Scripture, the will of
God, which before, was a booke cloſed, a booke
ſealed up to us, but alſo lift up our eyes to Heaven,
and looke into the volumes of eternitie, and read
our names written in the booke of life: The ſhac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kels
alſo fall from our feet, and we being inlarged,
are enabled, not only to walk in the Lords Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
but alſo, <hi>to run the way of his Commandements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though we groane under the burden of
our ſinnes, ſo long as we live here cloathed with
this body of death; yet we are freed from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of them, and ſtill grow on to perfection:
which then wee ſhall attaine, when we ſhall bee
tranſlated into the Heavens: where we ſhall receive
the end of our faith, even the ſalvation of our ſouls,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:220:81"/>
through his mercy, who hath ſo dearely bought
us, and brought us thither: where we ſhall enjoy
the bleſſed preſence of God, <hi>in whoſe preſence, there
is fulneſſe of joy, and pleaſure for evermore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bleſſed are the people that are in ſuch a caſe,</hi> in ſuch
a place, <hi>yea, bleſſed are the people whoſe God is the Lord.</hi>
But all this is made ours by faith only, which enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
us to the merits of <hi>Christ,</hi> who purchaſed it
for us: therefore faith is ſufficient. I ſhould now
juſtifie this by Scripture, but to ſay truth, this
truth and this Text, is the only ſcope of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
the theme of Theologie, the pith of all pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety:
and therefore becauſe it deſerves ſome better
obſervation, I will deferre it to ſome better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie.</p>

the golden Legend of Poets, of a fruitfull tree, of
which he ſayes,
<q>—Vno avulſo non deficit alter Aureus—</q>
and ſomething like, in <hi>Alcinous</hi>'s Garden: but
<hi>Chriſt</hi> is the tree of life, in the middeſt of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe

<hi>Chriſt</hi> is a fountaine, better then that Well of <hi>Iacob,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And thus I ſee I have taken up my ſpeech
where I let it fall the laſt time: for if you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
when I ended I ſaid a great word, <hi>That faith in
Chriſt crucified, was the theme of all Theologie, the
ſcope of all the Scripture;</hi> which now that I may <hi>libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare
fidem,</hi> I muſt endeavour to make good.</p>
               <p>I feare not that you ſhould thinke I make <hi>quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet
ex quolibet,</hi> as Alchymiſts they ſay can fetch
oyle out of flint, and as the Papiſts ſay, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is a noſe of wax, and make it ſo, when they
conclude the <hi>Popes ſupremacie</hi> out of <hi>Peters walking
on the waters:</hi> for I ſee my Text will warrant me
in what I have ſaid: for if <hi>Paul would preach nothing
but Chriſt Ieſus, and him Crucified,</hi> and yet was to
preach <hi>all that was neceſſarie to ſalvation,</hi> then que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe
he judged <hi>Chriſt</hi> crucified to bee the
ſumme of all: beſide this evidence that convinced
me, neceſſity compelled me to take this courſe:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:220:83"/>
for when I ſought for witneſſes of that I had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in the Scripture, the whole booke of God
offered it ſelfe: and therefore in ſuch copious
plentie, I deemed this the moſt compendious path,
to prove that in generall, which otherwiſe would
have proved infinite, if I had once minced it into
the particulars.</p>
               <p>Having thus ſcoured the way, I come now to
enter upon the point, to ſhew, <hi>that faith in Chriſt is
the ſumme of Divinitie, the ſcope of the Scripture:</hi> and
firſt, I will begin with <hi>Divinitie,</hi> becauſe the rule
of it being the <hi>Analogie of faith,</hi> will light us in the
ſearch of the ſecrets of the Scripture, and lead us
into the native meaning therof with more facility:
and this I will apply to the double conſideration
of Divinitie, both in the <hi>maine ſubſtance,</hi> which was
alway the ſame, and the <hi>mutable circumſtances</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
which according to divers times had ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie.</p>
               <p>The maine ſubſtance of Divinitie was alway
that <hi>Doctrine and Rule</hi> that chalked out the way, in
which man was to walk to eternall ſalvation, and
eternall happineſſe: which will eaſily appeare to
be ſummarily compriſed in <hi>faith,</hi> if that be true,
which is moſt true, which I have already proved,
that it is ſufficient to attaine ſalvation: and the ſame
will ſhine yet more brightly, if we do but lay
downe the ſeverals of the art, for this will be the
ſumme that all will amount to, this will be the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitome
of all, even <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> who is the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of faith,</hi> and the <hi>fountaine of all obedience,</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:220:84"/>
which are both, and all the parts of Divinitie.</p>
               <p>Take theſe aſunder now, and conſider them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally:
That <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the foundation of our faith,
I will alledge but one place for it: heare what <hi>Paul</hi>
ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 16. Great is the myſterie of godlines,
God manifeſted in the fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit, ſeene
of Angels, preached of Men, believed in the World,
received into glory.</hi> See here the myſterie, the whole

               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> it ſelfe will ſubſcribe to this Article, and
proove it too: for you know, the object of faith is
God alone, and by it we are united unto him, and
this was the condition of our integritie: our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
were temples of his bleſſed Spirit, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
of the Lord was in the ſonnes of men: but
now having provoked him to indignation againſt
us, by our voluntarie tranſgreſſion, his mind is ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated,
and the caſe is altered: his good Spirit
being grieved, is departed from us, and he frowns
upon us with an angry countenance: neither can
it be otherwiſe, for he could not <hi>love</hi> his owne ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
if he did not <hi>hate</hi> our iniquitie.</p>
               <p>We may read <hi>our miſery</hi> in <hi>Adams</hi> ſtory, who
after his ſinne, when he <hi>heard the voyce of the Lord
walking in the Garden, was afraid, and hid himſelfe:</hi>
And againe, in the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who hearing
the <hi>terrible thunders, and ſeeing the thick flaſhes of
lightning, and the mountaine ſmoaking, when the Law
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:220:84"/>
was given at Mount Sinai,</hi> in a great fright, came
to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Speake thou unto us, and we will
heare, but let not God ſpeake to us, lest we die:</hi> and the
reaſon of this is, becauſe our guiltie conſcience
ſuggeſts no other conceit of God unto us, but as of
an angry Judge, who is <hi>cloathed with revenge and
terrour, as with a garment, and whoſe garments are
dyed in blood,</hi> as the Prophet elſewhere ſpeaketh.
<hi>Moſes à</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And theſe examples teach us, in
what need we ſtand of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> who might
treate of <hi>peace,</hi> and make an <hi>attonement</hi> for us; for
otherwiſe, what faith, what confidence can we
have in God, whom ſinne hath made our enemie?
Now <hi>Chriſt alone is that Mediator:</hi> for hee by his
ſuffering hath ſmooth'd his Fathers brow, having
<hi>ſatisfied his juſtice:</hi> and beſide hath <hi>purchaſed</hi> his
Spirit for us, who teacheth us to <hi>call him Abba
Father;</hi> and through <hi>whom we have acceſſe with
boldneſse to the throne of grace:</hi> therefore he is the
<hi>foundation of our faith,</hi> which was the firſt part of
Divinitie.</p>
               <p>He is (in the ſecond place) the <hi>fountaine of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience:</hi>
I will content my ſelfe here alſo with
one place, looke <hi>Phil. 1. 9 And this I pray</hi> (ſaith
S. <hi>Paul) that your love may abound yet more and
more, in all knowledge, and in all judgement:</hi> and in
the 11. againe, <hi>that ye may be fild with all the fruits
of righteouſneſſe which are by Ieſus Chriſt, to the praiſe
and glory of God:</hi> behold here, love in all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and that love in aboundance, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance
yet more and more: behold againe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:220:85"/>
the fruits of righteouſneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all the fruits, and
a fulneſſe of all the fruits, and yet all this, and
more, if more may be, by <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> for he is the
<hi>Tree planted by the rivers of water,</hi> of which the
<hi>Pſalmist</hi> ſpeaketh, who is <hi>tranſplanted</hi> out of the old
<hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>ingrafted</hi> into the <hi>new,</hi> which is <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
he is the <hi>tree that bringeth forth her fruit in her ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:</hi>
for as ſoone as we are in him, ingrafted into
his ſtocke, watered with his blood, warmed with
his Spirit, who is the <hi>Sunne of righteouſneſſe,</hi> we are
inabled to bring forth the <hi>fruits of Righteouſneſse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And well may he challenge this intereſt in all
our obedience in a triple right.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe he hath <hi>performed all obedience in his
owne perſon,</hi> but in our name, and therefore for us.</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe all the <hi>abilitie</hi> we have to performe
any thing, is <hi>his gift,</hi> and the worke of his Spirit
in our hearts: <hi>For of our ſelves, as of our ſelves, we
can do nothing, but it is he that worketh in us both the
will and the deed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Becauſe he <hi>hides the deformities</hi> and <hi>waſhes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the <hi>ſpots</hi> of our actions, for otherwiſe, <hi>all our
righteouſneſſe is as a menstruous cloth:</hi> he perfects
all our imperfect performances. Survey but all
the parts of obedience, you ſhall find this true. In
the obſervation of the Decalogue, it is worth the
obſervation, that this is the preface, <hi>I am the Lord
thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt,
out of the houſe of bondage:</hi> we muſt be let at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> out of the bondage of <hi>Egypt,</hi> out of
the fetters of ſinne and Satan, before we can ſet a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:220:85"/>
ſtep in the way of Gods Commandements. And
for our <hi>prayers,</hi> we need no other Beades, or bed-roll,
<hi>Chriſt</hi> is the only Pearle of price in them: it
is his Spirit that kindles the fire of our zeale, that
<hi>teaches us how to pray, for we know not how to pray as
we ought:</hi> and it is himſelfe aſcending in the flame
of our ardent deſires, as he did once in <hi>Manoahs
ſacrifice,</hi> that makes God ſmell a ſweet ſavour,
which otherwiſe, would ſtinke in his noſthrils,
would be an abomination, and turne to ſinne. For
as <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> preſented himſelfe to the King of
the <hi>Moloſsi,</hi> under the protection of his ſon, and that
was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerves:
ſo unleſſe we come to God, in the name of his
ſonne, there is little hope of ſpeeding: unleſſe <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
come in the garments of his <hi>elder brother Eſau,</hi>
there is ſmall likelihood of <hi>a bleſsing;</hi> and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
we come cloathed with the <hi>Robes of Chriſt our
elder brother:</hi> but if we do, behold it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
yea, <hi>the Lord will bleſſe us,</hi> as <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſaid, <hi>and
we ſhall be bleſſed:</hi> The Sacrament receiving, is the
laſt act of our obedience, which without <hi>Christ</hi> are
but cold and dead carkaſes of Lions, unprofitable.</p>
               <p>In a word therefore, <hi>Christ</hi> alone is he that adds
<hi>value,</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> to our weake faith; <hi>beautie,</hi> to
our ſtained obedience: being the very <hi>foundation</hi>
of our faith, and the <hi>fountaine</hi> of our obedience: as
I have ſhewed of each of them <hi>ſeverally</hi> taken, and
will endeavour to the doe ſame of both <hi>joyntly</hi>
conſidered.</p>
               <p>If you looke for the proper place of <hi>faith in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:220:86"/>
Christ,</hi> in the <hi>bodie of Divinitie,</hi> you ſhall find it
ſeated in the very center, where it ſtands in a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
relation, <hi>of that which goes before,</hi> and that <hi>which
followes after.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which goes before, is the former part of
the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> which all mooves to it: that
which followes after it, is the <hi>Rule of life,</hi> and is all
mooved from it, and all the lines of either meet
in it.</p>
               <p>As it repreſents a <hi>Center,</hi> it is the <hi>heart of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</hi>
For, as in the naturall generation, the heart
is firſt articulated, and then the other parts: ſo in
our ſpirituall regeneration, faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi> is firſt
formed, before any other graces; and therefore
<hi>Paul</hi> cals the <hi>Galatians, his Children, of whom he
travelled in birth, till Christ were formed in them:</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>As wee looke upon it in that double relation,
(me thinks) upward and downeward, it expreſſes
<hi>Iacobs ladder</hi> which appeared in a viſion, by which
he ſaw <hi>Angels aſcending, and deſcending, and God
ſtanding on the top thereof:</hi> for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of all, is that <hi>ſcala coeli,</hi> by which we aſcend to
God, and deſcend to good workes: and <hi>Paul</hi> hath
excellenty deſcribed that compariſon in a moſt
ſweet gradation, <hi>Rom. 8. 29. Thoſe whom God hath
foreknowne, thoſe alſo he predeſtinated to be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the image of his ſonne; whom he predeſtinated,
thoſe alſo he called; whom he calleth, them he juſtifieth;
whom he juſtifieth, thoſe alſo he glorifieth:</hi> behold a
<hi>ſcala coeli,</hi> a <hi>golden chaine,</hi> and in it a <hi>deſcent of God</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:220:86"/>
to man, by the ſtepps <hi>of election and vocation,</hi>
and an <hi>aſcent of man to God,</hi> by the ſtaires of <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
and ſanctification,</hi> to the higheſt ſtate
of glory.</p>
               <p>I thinke now that I may conclude this point,
<hi>That Faith in Chriſt is the ſumme of Divinitie,</hi>
conſidered in the conſtant truth thereof; for in
him it pleaſed God <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect
and recapitulate all,</hi> even in this ſenſe: in
him it pleaſed <hi>God that all fulneſse ſhould dwell,</hi>
and in him dwels <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>fulneſſe</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
and it may be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> too, for the <hi>fulneſse of the
Divinitie bodily,</hi> and the <hi>body of Divinitie fully</hi>
dwell in him.</p>
               <p>Let us come yet a little lower, and take this
truth in the <hi>Rule of Divinitie,</hi> as it is in a double
difference, <hi>before Christ, and after Chriſt:</hi> before
<hi>Christ,</hi> againe as it was before the Law, or <hi>under
the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before <hi>the Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> I pray, what was the Religion
of <hi>Adam? Moſes</hi> touches it in a word, <hi>The ſeed
of the woman ſhall breake the head of the Serpent:</hi>
ſee the firſt prophecie concerning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and
that by God himſelfe: he that <hi>promiſed</hi> him, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyed</hi>
of him: for <hi>Chriſt</hi> was that <hi>Seede of the
woman,</hi> which brake the head of the Serpent,
and therefore was <hi>borne of a woman</hi> onely, a
<hi>Virgin</hi> that had not knowne a man, the <hi>Virgin
Mary:</hi> and therefore at the very time when hee
fulfilled this promiſe, when hee hung upon the
Croſſe, he ſaid to his Mother, <hi>woman, behold thy
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:220:87"/>
ſonne,</hi> (meaning <hi>Iohn</hi> to whoſe care he committed
her) <hi>woman,</hi> not <hi>mother,</hi> intimating, that he was
that ſeed of the woman, of whom God foretold
ſo long ago, that ſeed of the woman that brake the
head of the Serpent, the counſell of the Divell.</p>
               <p>Goe now to <hi>Abraham,</hi> what was the Religion
of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his familie? the Lord himſelfe
hath left it recorded, <hi>Abraham ſaw my day and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 56.</note>
this then was <hi>Abrahams</hi> joy, and <hi>Abrahams</hi>
Religion, even the expectation of the promiſed
ſeed, which was the <hi>ſoule</hi> of the covenant that God
made with him, the <hi>ſeale</hi> whereof was <hi>Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
an image of his bloodſhed: and therefore <hi>Iſaac
the ſonne of promiſe,</hi> if he had not beene called <hi>Iſaac
the ſonne of laughter,</hi> becauſe <hi>Sarah</hi> laughed in the
Tent doore, when ſhe heard the newes of a ſonne,
ſaying, <hi>Shall I that am barren beare a ſonne in mine
old age?</hi> he might have beene called <hi>Iſaac</hi> the ſonne
of laughter,<note place="margin">Gen. 21. 3 6.</note> becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw his day, who
was indeed the ſonne of promiſe, and rejoyced.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Iſaac</hi> was not that promiſed ſeed, of which
God ſaid, <hi>in thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the earth
be bleſſed:</hi> for by the ſame reaſon ſhould many
more be that ſeed, even all, that proceeded out of
the loines of <hi>Ahraham</hi> in the line of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> which
were like the ſtarrs of the Heaven in number: but

but of thy ſeed, as of one, which was Chriſt,</hi> in thy ſeed,
in this thy ſeed, ſhall all the Nations of the earth be
bleſſed.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Iſaac</hi> was but a <hi>type</hi> of that ſeed, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:220:87"/>
him in many reſemblances: <hi>Iſaac</hi> was borne
of <hi>Sarah</hi> a barren woman, and paſt beareing: <hi>Ieſus</hi>
was borne of <hi>Mary</hi> an unſpotted virgin, ſpringing
<hi>like a branch out of a drie land,</hi> as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeakes, like

which he was crucified: <hi>Iſaac</hi> was bound, <hi>Ieſus</hi>
was bound, <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhould have beene offered for a
ſacrifice, <hi>Ieſus</hi> was offered a ſacrifice for the ſinns
of the world: <hi>Iſaac</hi> on Mount <hi>Moriah, Ieſus</hi> as ſome

<hi>in the Mount will the Lord be ſeene,</hi> in <hi>Ieſus</hi> it
is much more true, <hi>for no man hath ſeene the father

and in him we ſee all the love of God, for <hi>behold

               </p>
               <p>Many ſuch like types had thoſe times, like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective

ſold by <hi>Iudahs</hi> motion, ſtood <hi>before Pharaoh</hi> at
thirty yeares old, whoſe coate dipped in blood
turn'd the wrath of his Father from his brethren,
even as <hi>Chriſt</hi> was ſtripped by the Souldiers, ſold
by <hi>Iudas</hi> treaſon, ſtood before God in his office
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:220:88"/>
about thirty yeares old, and in whoſe blood we
being dipped, are delivered from the wrath of
God the Father.</p>
               <p>From hence then we paſſe to the <hi>time under the

Indeed, all things then were more <hi>obſcurely</hi>

the <hi>ceremonies</hi> fled away, which were the <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes</hi>
of that <hi>ſubſtance:</hi> yet were they not deſtitute

               <p>Take an Emblem of their condition. The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their journey into the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
where guided by the conduct <hi>of a Pillar of
cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by night:</hi> their day
was ſomething overcaſt with a cloud, and yet
their darkneſſe was ſomething overcome with a
light: they had a day, but not without ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe
of a cloud; they lived in a night of darknes,
yet not without ſome glimpſe of light, for the
Lord led them to the heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> with a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
of cloud by day, and by night with a pillar
of fire.</p>
               <p>And perhaps the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> may inſinuate ſo
much, where he ſayes, <hi>Thy word is a Lanthorne to
my feet,</hi> for a Lanthorne argues <hi>much darkneſſe,</hi>
and is uſed in the night only; as for the day, mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
it were, <hi>ſplendente ſole lucernam accendere,</hi> but
againe, it argues <hi>ſome light,</hi> for otherwiſe, why
was it kindled? Neither is <hi>Peter</hi> farre from this

alluſion,<note place="margin">2 Pet 1. 19</note> when he compares the Word of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,

in a darke place.</hi> Agreeable to the firſt adum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration,
ther was a day, but with a pillar of cloud,
and a pillar of fire, but by night: and here wee
have a light, but of a Lanthorne, a light ſhining,
but in a darke place: this was then the ſtate of
Religion.</p>
               <p>Now all the light they had was borrowed
from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the ſtarres do theirs from the Sun:
and all lead us to <hi>Chriſt</hi> againe, as little Rivers to
the Ocean. See this.</p>
               <p>1. In their <hi>Sacraments,</hi> their ordinary Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to thoſe, we have <hi>Baptiſme</hi> and the <hi>Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:</hi>
which both, had reference to the ſame <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
grace,</hi> though there were a difference <hi>in the
outward elements:</hi> for what meant the <hi>blood,</hi> ſhed
in Circumciſion, and <hi>ſprinkled</hi> on their doore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts
in the Paſſeover, but the <hi>blood of Christ, ſhed
for the remiſsion of ſinnes,</hi> and <hi>ſprinkled in our</hi> hearts,
to <hi>purge and cleanſe</hi> all our iniquities: for <hi>Chriſt</hi>
was the true <hi>Paſchall Lambe,</hi> in whom therefore
the law of it was fulfilled,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 29</note> 
                  <hi>Not a bone of him ſhall
be broken:</hi> and of whom <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayes, <hi>Behold the
Lambe of God that taketh away the ſinnes of the world.
Chriſt</hi> is the Lambe ſlaine from the beginning of
the World for that purpoſe, and the very name of
<hi>Paſſeover</hi> notes as much: for in <hi>Chriſt</hi> it pleaſed
God, when he judges all the World, in <hi>mercy</hi> to
paſſe over us, and when he paſſed over all the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:220:89"/>
World in <hi>juſtice,</hi> to take his elect in mercy, and
make them his children. Yea <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when hee had celebrated the Paſſover with
his Diſciples, inſtituted the <hi>Sacrament of his body
and blood,</hi> to ſhew that he was that <hi>truth,</hi> of which
the <hi>Lambe</hi> was but a repreſentation. And in that
<hi>Paſſeover</hi> we may diſcerne a modell of our <hi>Supper:</hi>
they muſt eat it with <hi>ſowre hearbs,</hi> to wit, <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
and <hi>mortification,</hi> that they may the better
taſte the ſweet mercy of God, in their delivery
from the bondage of ſinne and Sathan, ſhadowed
out in the bondage of Egypt: ſo it is unto us a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
<hi>of our union to Chriſt our head:</hi> then they
were to eate it with ſweet unleavened bread,
that they might bee taught to take heed of the
ſowre leaven of malice: ſo is ours to us, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of communion with Saints, the bodie of
<hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The difference betweene ours and theirs is,
that their Sacraments were not without blood,
becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> as then had not ſhed his blood, but
ours are, becauſe the truth being come, the type is
needleſſe.</p>
               <p>Againe, what were the <hi>pillar of cloud and fire,</hi>
and the <hi>red Sea,</hi> in which they were <hi>baptiſed,</hi> as

<hi>Baptiſme of water and fire,</hi> even the <hi>effuſion</hi> of

the <hi>merit</hi> of his paſſion, and the efficacie of his

the <hi>Rocke,</hi> by ſtriking it with his Rod, when the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> were like to periſh in the wilderneſſe for
want of water, but the blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> iſſuing out
of all his body in a bloody ſweat in the Garden,
when the very wrath of God, the Rod of God
(for the <hi>chaſtiſements of our ſinnes was upon him</hi>) lay
heavie upon him, and ſtreaming out of his bleſſed

               <p>And that <hi>Mannah, that heavenly food,</hi> with

               <p>The <hi>Braſen Serpent,</hi> tell me, what can you ſee in
it, but <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was lifted up on the Croſſe, as
that was lifted up in the Wilderneſſe: and as that
ſaved all that looked to it, from the ſtinging of the
poyſonous Serpents, ſo hath <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaved us from
the power of the old Serpent the Divell, and all
the power of darkneſſe: he hath healed all our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
<hi>for by his ſtripes we are cured, and by his
wounds we are healed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee then, how all their Sacraments, <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:220:90"/>
and <hi>extraordinary,</hi> receive all their life from
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> and give all their light to him againe.</p>
               <p>All the laborious and teadious paedagogy of
their <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> was to no other end then this nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
in which this truth was written, as it were in
great Letters, that he that ran might read them,
becauſe all words of a thing not ſinſible, but ſo
farre off, could not be halfe ſo legible.</p>
               <p>So the <hi>blood of all the Sacrifices</hi> propitiatory, and
gratulatory, of <hi>Bullocks, and Rams, Goats, and Lambs,
Sheep, and Dove,</hi> were all but <hi>types</hi> and copies drawn
from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and drawing to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was the
true ſacrifice in which al the other were ſanctified,
(which otherwiſe were of no value) and by which
Gods juſtice is ſatisfied: and they were ſo many,
in ſuch varietie to ſeale to them his alſufficiencie.</p>
               <p>So were all their curious <hi>ablations,</hi> and chargable
<hi>oblations</hi> of roſt, baked, ſod, fryed, to teach our
perfect waſhing by his blood, and perfect nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by his body, which ſuffered the heat of <hi>Gods</hi>
wrath, and ſo was dreſſed to our appetite, and ſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with ſuch diverſity, that he might take away
our ſatietie.</p>
               <p>Sweet was the figure of the two <hi>Goates,</hi> one
of which was offered as a <hi>Sacrifice for the ſinnes of
the people,</hi> and the other (the <hi>Scape Goat</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
cals it) being charged with all their ſinnes,
<hi>Aaron laying both his hands upon his head, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsing
the ſinnes of the congregation over him, was let
goe into the wilderneſse:</hi> both which expreſſe <hi>Chriſt</hi>
in a double reſpect, either becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> was ſlaine
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:220:90"/>
that we might eſcape, or becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> the ſame
<hi>was dead and is alive,</hi> as the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſpeakes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he <hi>dyed for our ſinnes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 8. Rom. 4. 25</note> 
                  <hi>and roſe againe for our

               <p>Much like another in the <hi>purgation of the Leper,</hi>
where two Birds or Sparrows were to be brought
the one was to be <hi>kild,</hi> the other to be <hi>let flie,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dipped firſt in the blood of the former, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in a veſſell for that purpoſe, even as <hi>Chriſt</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for us, and wee being dipped in his blood,
eſcape, for by him the nets are broken, and we are
eſcaped.</p>
               <p>Yea and all their <hi>holy perſons</hi> did but repreſent
unto the people the perſon of the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> all their
<hi>Prieſts,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>High Priest,</hi> they ſacrificed,
and bleſſed the people in his name, who was that
<hi>Benedictum ſemen, in whom all the nations of the earth
were to be bleſſed, even Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> who is <hi>God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
for ever, and who gave himſelfe for us, a pleaſing
and acceptable ſacrifice to his father.</hi> And the <hi>High
Prieſt</hi> many wayes, he <hi>bare the names of the Tribes
of Iſrael on his ſhoulder,</hi> when he appeared before
God: ſo did <hi>Chriſt</hi> of all his faithfull: he <hi>entred
into the Holy of Holies once a yeare not without blood:</hi>
ſo did <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his owne blood, open the way for
us into the higheſt heavens, and make a paſſage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Paradiſe, in which we could not keep our ſelvs,
and out of which we were kept, by the flaming
ſword of a Cherubim: upon which the Poets
harping, have hatched a pretty Fable, that the <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea
Heſperidum mala,</hi> are kept by the vigilant guard
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:220:91"/>
of a fierie Dragon, but <hi>Hercules</hi> overcame him:
which in ſober truth is thus much, that the way
to the <hi>Tree of Life</hi> in the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> is guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the glittering blade of a glorious Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bim,
but <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath removed him.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the <hi>Holy places</hi> themſelves, were teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the ſame truth, ſo that if thoſe (the <hi>Prieſts</hi> I
meane) ſhould hold their tongues, theſe (the
ſtones I ſay) would cry thus much.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Tabernacle</hi> was a viſible ſigne of Gods
preſence among his people, and therefore in it
were placed (among many other things) the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
ſeat,</hi> even <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> in whom it hath pleaſed
God to have <hi>mercy on whom he will have mercy;</hi> and
the <hi>Table of Shew-bread,</hi> is the ſame <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whoſe
body is the true bread, by which we are fed to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life, which, as one obſerves, was <hi>panis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitionis,</hi>
in the Law, but is become <hi>panis aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis</hi>
in the Goſpell, even the bread of the Lords
Table.</p>
               <p>So was the Temple, and therefore they were
to offer their Sacrifices at the Temple, and their
prayers in or toward the Temple, becauſe all
were ſanctified and accepted in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was
the true Temple, for ſo he ſayes of his body, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
this temple, and I will raiſe it againe in three
dayes:</hi> and therefore when <hi>Christ</hi> was come into
the world, <hi>the true light which enlightneth all men
that come into the world,</hi> all theſe ſhadows vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at his preſence and fled away.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Leviticall Miniſterie</hi> ceaſed, as you may ſee
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:220:91"/>
in a ſweet alluſion which ſome have obſerved:
When God promiſed <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> to <hi>Zachary,</hi> as
he was diſcharging his office in his courſe, <hi>he was
ſtricken dumbe,</hi> and therefore; when the people ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
he ſhould have bleſſed them, he could not
ſpeake, <hi>tacuit Zacharias generaturus vocem,</hi> ſaith
one: this ſilence proclaimed that that ſervice was
at an end: the ſilence of a Leviticall Prieſt, made
way for the voice of an Evangelicall Preacher, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>Iohn,</hi> who was a <hi>voice preparing the way of the
Lord Ieſus,</hi> the only High Prieſt of our ſalvation.</p>
               <p>You have heard that the <hi>Heathen Oracles</hi> ceaſed
at the birth of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſo did the <hi>Iewiſh Oracles</hi> too,
before his birth, for they had no anſwer from
God by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> all the time of
the ſecond Temple, and ſo you ſee that the <hi>Iewiſh
Prieſthood</hi> ceaſed too: and at the death of <hi>Chriſt,
the vaile of the Temple rent inſunder: Theophylact</hi>
hath a witty conceit, a pretty gloſſe, that the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
rent her vaile, hearing of the blaſphemies of
the <hi>Iewes</hi> uttered againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> according to the
faſhion of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who rent their garments when
they heare any blaſphemies: but this was the
meaning ſurely, to ſhew that by the rents of his
body the true Temple, the <hi>way</hi> was opened to all
the faithfull into the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> the higheſt
Heavens.</p>
               <p>And no marvaile it is, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon the
croſſe ſhould cauſe all ſhadowes to vaniſh: the T
(which men make the figure of the Croſſe) in
the Egyptian myſteries, is an Hieroglyphick of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:220:92"/>
eternall life, which (ſay they) when it comes,
ſhall put an end to our Religion. It may be they
had ſome notion of ſuch a thing from the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
or rather it is an after-birth: but this is certaine,
that <hi>Chriſt</hi> lifted up upon the Croſſe was in his
Meridian exaltation, no marvaile then, if the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
vaniſhed.</p>
               <p>We reade of one that wondred how his Hoſt
had furniſhed his table with ſo rare variety, his
Hoſt anſwered, that all was but Swines fleſh, only
the art of the Cooke had made the difference:
and I according to my abilitie have diſcovered,
that all the diſhes of the old Ceremonies, furniſh
us with no other thing but <hi>Chriſt,</hi> only the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the Lord diverſly dreſſed his ſons fleſh,
in proportion to the times, and palats of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
in ſuch admirable variety.</p>
               <p>Come we now to the laſt period of times, the
<hi>time of the Goſpell,</hi> and ſee the muſicall harmony
thereof with the former: wherein me thinks, I
preſage already, that my talke will be more eaſie:
for what meanes the departure of all the Legall
ſhadowes, at the approach of <hi>Christ;</hi> if he were
not the ſubſtance of all: and therefore the aboliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thoſe is a cleare evidence, that <hi>Chriſt now is
all in all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Doctrine preached every where, is a ſilver
Trumpet of this ſacred truth: but that having
beene alway the ſame, my courſe propounded,
permits me not to inſiſt upon it: only this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
it hath, that as it pointed forward before to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:220:92"/>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> to come, ſo now it pointeth backward to
<hi>Chriſt</hi> come, in whom it teacheth every man to
looke for ſalvation, and no other: the outward
ſignes that are left are few, but they conſpire in the
ſame teſtimonie with the Doctrine, and the old
ceremonies, ſealing the ſame thing, but with more
ſimplicity, and with more ſignificancie.</p>
               <p>The <hi>water of Baptiſme</hi> hath a ſutable Analogie
with the blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> by which we are purged
from our ſpirituall uncleanneſſe of ſinne, as we are
purged by water from all corporall uncleanneſſe.
<hi>In the Lords Supper</hi> we have bread and wine, meat
and drinke perfect nouriſhment: bread the ſtaffe
of mans life, and wine that maketh glad the heart
of man, the beſt <hi>elements</hi> to expreſſe the beſt <hi>ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi>
which how fully doe they ſet forth <hi>Chriſt</hi>
Crucified: the Bread is broken, ſo was his body
broken; the Wine is powred forth, ſo was his
blood powred forth upon the Croſſe, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of ſinnes, to all thoſe that come to him
with an hunger and thirſt after his righteouſneſſe,
and feed on him by a lively faith.</p>
               <p>The ſignification is ſo emphaticall, that I may
ſay of thoſe that are partakers of this, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid
of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who had heard him preach
<hi>Christ</hi> crucified,<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>before whoſe eyes Christ cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
was ſet forth,</hi> I may ſay it of all ſuch, except
they bee fooliſh <hi>Galatians,</hi> and except they bee
bewitched.</p>
               <p>And thus I conclude this point, That <hi>Chriſt
Crucified, is the Summe of all Divinitie, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:220:93"/>
of all ceremonies, the ſoule of all Sacraments,
the Kernell, and Key of all knowledge, the Center,
and circumference of all Divine wiſdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I had thought to have gone a little further, as
<hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Goſpell, beyond <hi>Emaus,</hi> but the
importunity of the time, which will take no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall,
forces me to turn in here againſt my will.</p>

was the <hi>ſumme of Divinitie,</hi> and the <hi>ſcope of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:</hi>
that it was the ſumme of Divinitie, as I
could, I then evinced, by caſting up the reckoning
of both the parts thereof, faith, and obedience,
which amounted to no more but this: for wee
found that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the <hi>foundation</hi> of faith, and
the <hi>fountaine</hi> of obedience, the <hi>Iacobs</hi> Ladder, of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and deſcent, <hi>deſcent</hi> of God to man, <hi>aſcent</hi> of
man to God: and as the <hi>Spouſe</hi> ſpeaks in the <hi>Ganti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
he is <hi>Sigillum cordis, &amp; Sigillum brachii,</hi> for he
is the ſtampe of faith in the heart, that is <hi>Sigillum
cordis,</hi> and he is the ſtampe of good works in the
hand, that is <hi>Sigillum brachii:</hi> in the hands<note n="*" place="margin">

is <hi>Chriſt</hi> the ſumme of Divinitie.</p>
               <p>It remaines now then that we ſhould cleare the
other, that he is the <hi>Scope of all the Scripture:</hi> which
I will do firſt in generall, and ſo leade you on into
the particulars. In generall, this may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated,
by that which hath been before delivered:
for if faith in <hi>Christ</hi> be the Epitome of the Rule of
Divinitie, then needs muſt it be ſo likewiſe of the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:220:95"/>
Scripture that containes that Rule: and that in a
double reſpect.</p>
               <p>1. As the <hi>immutable ſubſtance</hi> of the Rule is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
the ſubſtance was alway that which leads
man to eternall Salvation, which is by <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi>
only: and this is the maine ſcope of the Scripture
in generall.</p>
               <p>For all the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> being guilty of
high treaſon againſt the moſt High: the <hi>hand wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Law inditeing us: Heaven</hi> and <hi>earth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſsing
againſt us:</hi> the <hi>Grand jurie of the bleſſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
finding us guiltie: our <hi>owne conſciences</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
guilty; what remaines, but to heare the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſentence of condemnation pronounced againſt
us, by the mouth of the moſt juſt Judge, the Lord
Almightie? Yet the <hi>mercy of the Lord</hi> was ſuch,
that when the Law had caſt us, the Lord called us
to pardon. And as the Clergie of our Land is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged
in many caſes to have their booke: ſo
was it his pleaſure, to give his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>his inheritance,</hi>
his peculiar, their booke, that by their booke they
may be ſaved, and this booke is the booke of the
Scripture.</p>
               <p>The Scripture againe is the <hi>Letter of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie</hi>
to the ſonnes of men (as one cals it) <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by God himſelfe, and the Angell of his great coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
Chriſt Ieſus</hi> (for ſo <hi>Eſay</hi> ſtiles him) together
with his <hi>Spirit, penned</hi> by his principall Secretaries
the <hi>holy Prophets and Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>ſealed</hi> with the
<hi>blood of the Lamb:</hi> let me goe a little further, they
are the <hi>Literae laureatae,</hi> the <hi>Superſcription</hi> is, <hi>To the</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:220:96"/>
faithfull, the <hi>Salutation</hi> is <hi>Salutem in Chriſto:</hi> The
<hi>Argument</hi> is nothing but a Proclamation of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
pardon in his name to all penitent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
ſinners.</p>
               <p>This is the Summe of the Scriptures in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
and this is the firſt demonſtration that <hi>Christ</hi>
is the ſumme thereof: becauſe Divinitie and it,
like two twinnes, keepe pace with a mutuall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency,
like two parallels, runne on in equall
extent, beginning and ending both together, and
the ſumme of the one is the ſumme of the other,
and the ſumme of both is eternall happines, which
is to bee looked for, and can bee found in <hi>Chriſt</hi>
alone.</p>
               <p>2. This is the firſt proportion we find between
them: the ſecond offers it ſelfe to your conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the Scripture may be accommodated to
the <hi>mutable circumſtances</hi> of the Rule, according to
the difference of time before and after <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord made in the beginning <hi>duo magna Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaria,
the great to rule the day, and the leſſe to rule
the night,</hi> the Sunne and the Moone. Much like to
this, there be two portions of the light which God
hath revealed, concerning our ſalvation, given to
guide two times: the <hi>old Teſtament,</hi> the leſſer light,
like the Moone, to rule the night of ignorance,
when the Doctrine of the Meſſiah was more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely
delivered: the <hi>New,</hi> the greater light, like
the Sun, to rule the day of knowledge, which the
faithfull have injoyed, ever ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Sunne
of righteouſneſſe appeared. When it was night
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:220:96"/>
there muſt needs be many <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> like many
ſhadowes, and many humours, by reaſon of the
feeble light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and heat the influence of the Moone
afforded, which the vertue of the Sun hath ſince
dryed up or driven away.</p>
               <p>Or, the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> is like the <hi>light created the
firſt day,</hi> which though it wanted that glorious and
reſplendent luſtre, yet it ſeparated betweene night
and day, <hi>Goſhen</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> the beloved City and
the Gentiles: and the porportion holds of a day
to a thouſand yeares, <hi>for a thouſand yeares is as but a
day in thy ſight,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt:</hi> and ſo as the
Sunne was ſet in his Tabernacle the fourth day of
the world; ſo the Sunne of righteouſneſſe came in
the 4000. yeare of the World, in the Tabernacle
of his fleſh, <hi>to fulfill all righteouſneſſe.</hi> And perhaps
the 19. <hi>Pſalme</hi> may have ſome relation to this
compariſon: for there the <hi>Sunne is deſcribed, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam
Sponſus,</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi> is deſcribed, <hi>tanquam Sponſus
Eccleſiae:</hi> and the Prophet ſlides there from the
Sunne, it may be becauſe of this Analogie, to the
Elogies of the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Now both theſe were the <hi>ſame light,</hi> for the
Moone receives hers from the Sunne, and the
light of the Sunne is but the conglobation of the
firſt light: Even as both the Teſtaments teach
but one <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for he only dyed for us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are both his Teſtaments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Old Teſtament</hi> containes him in the Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks
of Sacrifices, and Types, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies:
the <hi>New,</hi> in legible and ordinary characters:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:220:97"/>
                  <hi>in the old,</hi> he was like the corne in the eare, <hi>in the
New,</hi> like the corne ſhaken out. <hi>in the Old,</hi> like the
<hi>Mannah</hi> which was hidden in a pot, for he is that
<hi>hidden Mannah,</hi> in the Arke: <hi>in the New,</hi> like the
<hi>Shew-bread,</hi> that was ſet upon the Table: in both
of them, the ſame <hi>Chriſt, heri, hodie &amp; in aeternum
idem Chriſtus: yeſterday, in the Old Teſtament,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the time of the Law; <hi>to day, in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
under the time of the Goſpell: <hi>yeſterday and
to day and for ever the ſame Chriſt, who is God bleſsed
for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For they both are but one booke, but the booke
that was ſhut before by the comming of the Lamb
is opened, for the Lambe opened the booke that
we may fetch a reſemblance of this Revelation,
out of the booke of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> Compare the
Miniſters of both the covenants, and we ſhall ſee
the ſame: for as it was ſaid once,<note n="*" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Divines have ſaid as much, that the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
is but <hi>Novum involutum,</hi> and <hi>the new,</hi> but
<hi>Vetus revelatum:</hi> as the Stoicks of old ſaid of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick
and Logick; comparing them to <hi>pugnus &amp;
palma,</hi> as though the difference were no more but
in contraction and explication, obſcurity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuitie.
This ſhall ſerve for the propoſition of my
ſecond generall Reaſon: that the Old and New
Teſtament, contain nothing but faith in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:220:97"/>
But theſe two are the whole Scripture: ſome
have gathered out of thoſe words of Chriſt,
<hi>Matth. 13. 52. Every Scribe learned to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Heaven, is like a certaine houſhoulder, which
brings out of his treaſure old and new:</hi> The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quution
is but idle, but the concluſion is infallible,
that there is no more Scripture, but the old and
new Teſtament.</p>
               <p>And thus many God would have for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of our Faith, that in the mouth of two or
three witneſſes every word might ſtand. For
though <hi>Origen</hi> do but deſcant upon thoſe words,
when he ſayes, <hi>in the mouth of two, that is the old
and new Testaments;</hi> and <hi>in the mouth of three,</hi> that is,
<hi>Prophets, Evangeliſts, Apoſtles,</hi> the truth of the
word, the word of truth ſhall ſtand aſſured: yet
this is moſt certaine, that the foretelling, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of the ſame thing, I ſay, the ſame thing <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told</hi>
ſo long before it was <hi>fulfilled,</hi> and <hi>fulfilled</hi> ſo
long after it was <hi>foretold,</hi> makes exceedingly for
the ſupporting of our faith, as being an invincible
argument, that this word is the word of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
God, before whom all times are preſent.</p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>Teſtament</hi> then, like <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi>
build the faith of the elect; like two ſiſters inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
companions hold hand in hand: chained
faſter together then the invincible Armado: for
<hi>Malachie</hi> gives his Lampe to <hi>Marke,</hi> as they
did in the games at <hi>Athens,</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> takes it
where he leaves it, the <hi>end of Malachie</hi> reaches to
the <hi>beginning of Marke: Mark</hi> begins, and <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:220:98"/>
ends with <hi>Iohn Baptiſt:</hi> ſo are they ſecretly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
together, and holding hands (take this by
the way) they plucke a Crow with the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrypha,</hi>
if I may ſo ſpeake in ſo grave an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe premiſes, that the <hi>old and new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
containe nothing but the <hi>doctrine of Faith in
Chriſt, and ſalvation by Chriſt,</hi> and yet they two
make up the intire body of the Scripture, and this
is my inference, that <hi>Faith in Christ is the ſcope of
the Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I deſcend now from the <hi>generall</hi> to the <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>
declaration of this point: And firſt, <hi>for the old
Testament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To let goe all their <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> with
the whole ancient ſtate of Religion among the
<hi>Iewes,</hi> which all had reference to the comming of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> the promiſed Meſſiah, which make a great
part of the argument of the booke of the firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
becauſe I touched them the laſt time: and
to let paſſe whole bookes which have nothing but
this, as the booke of <hi>Ruth,</hi> a Grand-mother of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Booke of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> a ſweet E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithalamie,
or ſpouſall of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Church,
I will divide it for this time into two portions, <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricall</hi>
and <hi>Propheticall,</hi> and make good the point
in either of them, and that briefly, becauſe I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that my entrance hath exceeded already the
ſcantling of time allotted to this exerciſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I reſolve to end this at this time, that ſo I
may ſet afreſh upon the uſe of this Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:220:98"/>
The <hi>Hiſtoricall part</hi> of the old <hi>Teſtament,</hi> beſide
the hiſtorie of life openly propounded, containes
the <hi>myſterie of faith</hi> alſo ſweetly couched therin: as
will eaſily appeare, if you doe but conſider the
<hi>periods</hi> of times, the context and continuation of
the ſtorie, with the remarkable examples here and
there diſperſed.</p>
               <p>A man would thinke thoſe many <hi>Genealogies</hi>
and many names very harſh and teadious, like
craggy mountaines full of ſtones, but barren of all
fruit: but if you will vouchſafe to make but a
little inquiſition, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to digge into the bowels
of thoſe mountaines, you ſhall find a golden vaine,
a golden chaine, conſiſting of many linkes, from
the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> to the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> to derive his
pedigree and ſhew his generation, of whom
<hi>Eſay</hi> ſayes, <hi>Who can tell his generation,</hi> for hee
is the <hi>eternall Word of his Father, and the ancient
of dayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I pray tell me, wherefore is there ſuch a
curious context of ſucceſſion from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah,</hi>
from <hi>Noah</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>David,</hi>
from <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Zorubabell,</hi> from <hi>Zorubabel</hi> to <hi>Mary,</hi>
but to draw a golden line (as you have ſeene the
golden line in the Genealogies) a <hi>via lactea</hi> to lead
to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in whom all Genealogies are ended, and
accounted by <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſame ranke with Matae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologies,
and old wives Fables. And therefore
<hi>Matthew</hi> begins his Goſpell with this, and cals it
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a Booke, a Bible,</hi> becauſe this is the very Map
and Epitome of the whole Bible, as it was in the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:220:99"/>
old Teſtament, that he might by this divine art of
inſinuation, teach the end and uſe of all that was
then written.</p>
               <p>The like may be picked out of the very <hi>names
there regiſtred;</hi> for though the conceit of the <hi>Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts</hi>
be fond and vaine, that patch up the names of
<hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Ieſus,</hi> by a ſtrange Alchymie of Rapſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and Anagrams, out of diverſe paſſages
of the Scripture, yet this ought to be of ſome
importance, that religious parents impoſed ſuch
names to their children, as might be monuments
of the Meſſiah: Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> hath obſerved
many, and I ſpare to repeate any.</p>
               <p>View againe the <hi>Succeſsion of Kings, Prieſts and
Prophets,</hi> you ſhall finde that all thoſe ſeverall cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
emptie themſelves into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as rivers into
the Ocean, and Crown him with a triple Crown,
for hee is the <hi>King, Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Prophet</hi> of his
Church, of whoſe comming all the reſt were but
Harbengers. I ſay, they three, like the three <hi>Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
offer Gold, and Myrrhe, and Frankincenſe,</hi> and
ſo make a triple Crowne for <hi>Christ:</hi> and ſo again,
make a three twined ſcourge, to whip the uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Whore out of the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi>
ſerved the <hi>Truckſters, buyers and ſellers, and money
changers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus is the <hi>ſeries</hi> of the ſtorie contracted into
<hi>Chriſt</hi> the ſumme of all, the ſame leſſon may be
read written in great letters (that hee that runnes
may read them) in thoſe many illuſtrious exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
of all thoſe three kinds recorded in Scripture:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:220:99"/>
ſo that if there were not many expreſſe notes, yet
there were many notable impreſſions, many <hi>viſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia
omnia te adverſum ſpectantia,</hi> all looking to
<hi>Christ</hi>-ward, each of them giving a taſte of that
which <hi>Chriſt</hi> performed in all fulneſſe.</p>
               <p>1 For <hi>Prieſts,</hi> I need not name any, becauſe
they all repreſented <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if not in their <hi>perſonall
excellencies,</hi> yet in their <hi>officiall performances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. For <hi>Prophets,</hi> I will name a few, becauſe they
were ſo many: Two aſcended into Heaven, <hi>Enoch</hi>
before the Law, <hi>Elias</hi> in the Law: thus was <hi>Chriſts</hi>
aſcenſion, who was <hi>primitiae dormientium,</hi> a maine
Article of our faith prefigured: Three before
<hi>Chriſt</hi> were raiſed from the dead, one by <hi>Eliah,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
by <hi>Eliſha,</hi> a third, by touching the bones of
<hi>Eliſha</hi> being dead, revived: even as three were
raiſed in the Goſpell, the <hi>daughter of Iairus</hi> in the
houſe, the <hi>Widowes ſon</hi> in the gate, <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the grave: thus was one of the greateſt
miracles of our Saviour, and his owne reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who was <hi>primitiae dormientium,</hi> prefigured.
<hi>Elias</hi> after his wearie perſecution by <hi>Ahab,</hi> lying
under the Juniper tree, complained, and deſired
that he might die: ſo did <hi>Ionas,</hi> when the Sunne
beate upon his head, after the <hi>Gourd was withered,</hi>
and ſomething more frowardly: thus was the <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Chriſt</hi> prefigured, and the moſt uncouth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igent
thereof: for when the wrath of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
like the rayes of the Sunne, beat upon him,
when hee hung upon the Croſſe, then was hee
brought under the Juniper tree: for the heat of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:220:100"/>
the heat of the wrath of God, was hotter than Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper
coales, yet he underwent it for the love of
us men, and our ſalvation <hi>conſtrained him,</hi> for the
fire of love is hotter then the coales of Juniper:
<hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> faſted forty dayes in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
ſo did <hi>Chriſt;</hi> who notwithſtanding fed five
thouſand with five loaves, as <hi>Eliſha</hi> typically had

               <p>I had intended to have propounded more; but

otherwiſe were they but glaſſes which did not
bound the light, but tranſported the godly to the
contemplation of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The accommodation is eaſie, but I haſten: yet
I cannot paſſe by the type of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> it was ſo
lively: for as <hi>Sampſon</hi> by his owne death was the
death of thouſands of <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ſlew
<hi>Goliah</hi> with his owne ſword: ſo <hi>Christ</hi> overcame
death, by undergoing death, and brake the head
of the Serpent, by ſuffering him to bruiſe his heel:
for in him the fiction of <hi>Achilles</hi> is no fiction, that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:220:100"/>
being otherwhere impenetrable, his heele was
not: for <hi>Chriſt</hi> was only penetrable in his heele,
<hi>his humanitie,</hi> his <hi>Deitie</hi> remaining altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſible.</p>
               <p>I am raviſhed with delight in theſe ſacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of antiquitie: yet I muſt cut off what I
thought to have added: and me thinks I heare
ſome wondring, what all this makes to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in hand: I anſwer, as <hi>Tamar</hi> convinced <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
by his <hi>ſtaffe</hi> and his <hi>ſignet,</hi> and <hi>Theſeus</hi> his

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that made him knowne, were a paſport
and certificate to his father of his legitimation: ſo
<hi>Christ</hi> is acknowledge to be <hi>Ieſus, to be Meſsiah,</hi> by
theſe performances: for theſe are the <hi>teſſerae</hi> of
commerce, the watch word betweene the old and
new. Teſtament: the badges of the whole booke,
proclaiming to us they doe belong: the joynts and
gimmers by which either of them is (as it were)
ſcrued into the other: Mercuriall ſtatues, pointing
the way to <hi>Christ:</hi> Starres in ſtorie, like the <hi>ſtarre
that appeared to the Wiſemen,</hi> guiding them to
<hi>Bethlehem,</hi> where it ſtood ſtill: for all ended in
<hi>Christ,</hi> and he is the end of all.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Hiſtoricall part of the old Teſtament</hi> is
full of Aſterisks, and hands, and lines, that draw
the intelligent reader to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> To conclude this
point, this is the uſe of <hi>Genealogies,</hi> to track
the way of ſalvation, by the golden line that
leades to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and this is the wiſdome of
wiſemen, to follow the conduct of the ſtarre,
till we come to him, who is the true morning-ſtar,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:220:101"/>
the true Load-ſtarre that guides our wandring feet
in our wearie pilgrimage to eternall reſt in the
heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Propheticall</hi> part is more plaine by many
degrees almoſt palpable: for there was not any
thing almoſt <hi>fulfilled</hi> by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but it was <hi>foretold</hi>
by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> as there was not any thing <hi>foretold</hi>
by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> which was not fulfilled by <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

in <hi>Ionas,</hi> comming out of the <hi>Whales bellie:</hi>
He aſcended into Heaven, as <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi>

               <p>2. Becauſe <hi>Chriſt crucified</hi> more ſpecially
makes for our purpoſe; conſider it of his <hi>paſsion</hi> in

me,</hi>

                  <hi>my familiar in whom I trusted,</hi> ſaith <hi>David:</hi>
ſold for thirty pieces of ſilver: ſome would have
it to anſwer to the price of the ointment that <hi>Mary</hi>
powred upon his feet, becauſe <hi>Iudas</hi> murmured:
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:220:101"/>
and ſo that hee did it, <hi>ut impleretur,</hi> that the bagge
might be filled: thus the covetous Traitor ſhould
have ſold the <hi>annointed of the Lord,</hi> to have gained
the ointment, but this was not it: here was the
true reaſon, <hi>ut impleretur, that the Scripture might
be fulfilled,</hi> that ſaid ſo much, <hi>Zach. 11. 12. So they
weighed my price thirty pieces of ſilver, a goodly price,
that I was prized of them:</hi> he was Crucified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
two Thieves, for ſo ſaith the Scripture,
<hi>with the wicked was he counted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Nay, even petty things were not omitted:
he thirſted, well might he thirſt, who was ſo

weight of Gods wrath <hi>that he ſweat water and blood,</hi>
and therefore well might he ſay <hi>he thirſted, ut im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleretur,</hi>
that he might quench it, but this was the
maine cauſe, <hi>ut impleretur,</hi> that the Scripture might
be fulfilled, <hi>for it was meat and drink for him to doe
his fathers will:</hi> they gave him vinegar to drinke,
ſo <hi>David:</hi> They caſt lots for my garments, ſo

                  </gap>: ſo <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie,</hi>
they <hi>ſhall ſee him whom they have pierced.</hi> I
might be infinite: and <hi>Matthew</hi> alone hath gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>I end this point with that of <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 10. 43.
<hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſſe, that through his
name whoſoever believeth in him ſhall receive remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:220:102"/>
of ſinnes:</hi> the place is very plaine, and thoſe
words of the Prophets are thriſe repeated in the
third of that booke: for all the <hi>Prophets</hi> are many
times <hi>Boanerges,</hi> ſonnes of thunder, and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they fetch all from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> where there
were thunder and lightning and earthquakes when
the Law was given: but all theſe ſtormes uſually
end in ſome calme of conſolation: and when they
would be <hi>Barnabas,</hi> ſons of conſolation, they fetch
all from Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> the ſweet promiſes of the
<hi>Meſsiah,</hi> and ſteepe all their words in his blood.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the ſcope of the <hi>Propheticall part</hi>
of the old Teſtament: I ſhould ſhew the ſame in
the new alſo, but it will be needleſſe: every letter
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by the very ſound, as the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
ſpeakes, avouches this truth: The foure <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts,</hi>
what are they but the ſtorie of his life and
death?<note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 31</note> Let <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeake for them all, <hi>Theſe things

believing have everlaſting life, through his name:</hi> I
will not hunt for compariſons, nor ſhew what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
they have to the foure <hi>beaſts</hi> in <hi>Ezekiel:</hi>
but me thinkes all the reſt aime at his <hi>humanitie</hi>
more principally: <hi>Iohn</hi> only, like the <hi>Eagle,</hi> is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
eyed, and as though he had ſome window into
his breaſt, as well as he leaned on his breaſt, hee
peirceth through the vaile of his fleſh to his <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
and draws his pedigree from heaven through
eternitie.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Providence of the Lord</hi> is worth obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that he would have foure to write this ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:220:102"/>
all in a moſt celeſtiall harmony; two of which,
the two Apoſtles <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were <hi>ocular,</hi>
and two, the two <hi>Evangeliſts Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi>
witneſſes of that which they wrote, that all
pretext of doubting might be excluded.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Acts</hi> have nothing but the ſame <hi>Chriſt</hi>
preached among the Gentiles, for he brake downe
the wall of ſeparation. And as after the flood, there
was a confuſion of tongues, to hinder the building
of <hi>Babel:</hi> ſo was there the <hi>effuſion of the gift of
tongues,</hi> to further the <hi>building of the heavenly Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
that all knees might bow, and all tongues
confeſſe that <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the Lord.</p>
               <p>All the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> have no other argument but <hi>ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
by Chriſt,</hi> as may appeare out of the ſalutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Grace and peace in Chriſt Ieſus, grace</hi> the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and <hi>peace</hi> the perfection of all happineſſe, and
both by <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is obſerved, that the very name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> is
uſed by <hi>Paul</hi> alone, above five hundred times: and
no wonder, for there be in it a thouſand treaſures,
as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaid, yea all the <hi>treaſures of wiſdome
and knowledge</hi> and comfort, are hid and lockt up in
him: The whole <hi>Revelation</hi> what is it but a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitorie
for the obſervation of the government
of the Church by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the King thereof, and the
expectation of his glorious comming, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of all evidences, <hi>Come Lord Ieſus, come
quickly,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Tanquam habeat ſcriptum tota tabella, veni.</l>
                  </q>
That I may didicate an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Jewell to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Tabernacle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:220:103"/>
And thus I ſhut up this part, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the
ſumme of both <hi>Old and New Teſtament:</hi> in theſe
three differences, as to come in the Old, and in the
New as come, and to come againe to judgement.</p>
               <p>And me thinks, thoſe two are like the two <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims,</hi>
that ſhadowed one Mercy-ſeat, their faces
were one toward another, and their wings; but
both toward <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Mercy-ſeat: like <hi>Ezekiels
viſion,</hi> where the foure creatures ſtirred and ſtood
ſtill both together: whoſe wheels were, as it were,
one wheele within another, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> in all: like
the Spies, that returned to <hi>Moſes</hi> out of <hi>Canaan:</hi>
for as they brought the cluſters of Grapes (a map
of that good Land) betweene them, ſo the two
Teſtaments bring nothing but <hi>Chriſt</hi> betweene
them: now <hi>Chriſt is the true Vine,</hi> as himſelf ſayes,
like the <hi>cluſters of Grapes,</hi> as the <hi>Spouſe</hi> ſpeaks: and
his blood is the Wine of the Sacrament, the wine
that maketh glad the heart of the faithfull, which
was ſcruzed out of his body upon the Croſſe, the
<hi>Winepreſse of Gods wrath;</hi> where you may behold
him excellently, <hi>tanquam uva paſſa, Christ Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> is like the hinges, upon
which the whole frame of time, upon which the
<hi>bifores valvae</hi> of the houſe of the Sunne, the two
Tabernacles, the two gates of Heaven, doe hang
and turne themſelves.</p>
               <p>And now I hope, though this my diſcourſe bee
very imperfect, yet it will not bee altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
or unprofitable: for this one point, that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:220:103"/>
                  <hi>faith in Chriſt crucified is the ſumm of al the Scripture,</hi>
well conſidered, muſt needs give very much light
to the reading of every part thereof: it will be like
a key, to unlock the meaning, and ſo make way to
the rich treaſure therein, like a clue of thread, to
lead us thorow many intricate Labyrinths therof.
And this makes me call to mind, what I forgat e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
now, that the <hi>red thread that Rahab</hi> hung out of
her window, when <hi>Iericho</hi> was beſeiged, was an
Embleme of <hi>Chriſt Crucified,</hi> by whom all the
faithfull muſt be ſaved from eternall death, as ſhe
was then preſerved from preſent deſtruction:
much bettet then <hi>Leucotheae vitta,</hi> or <hi>Ariadnes
filum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let me wind up all that hath beene ſaid, <hi>Chriſt
is the ſumme of all Divinity:</hi> me thinks the <hi>Clypeus
fidei,</hi> is like that <hi>Clypeus Phidiae,</hi> the <hi>Buckler of faith</hi>
like the buckler of <hi>Phidias,</hi> that Hiſtorians ſpeake
of, I meane the Buckler of <hi>Minerva,</hi> which <hi>Phidias</hi>
made: for as in it he had ſo curiouſly intrailed his
owne name, that it could not be taken out without
the diſſolution of the whole frame; ſo hath <hi>Chriſt</hi>
ſo divinely wrought his <hi>name</hi> in the worke of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
the rule of Divinitie, that it cannot be taken
out, but that golden chaine, that <hi>ſeries cauſarum,</hi>
will all fall in ſunder.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Epheſians,</hi> when <hi>Croeſus</hi> beſeiged them,
chained their City to the <hi>Temple of Diana,</hi> the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
theirs, when <hi>Alexander,</hi> to the Statue of
<hi>Hercules:</hi> and ſo all the precepts of Divinitie ſeem
to be chained to the Croſſe of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> he is the <hi>um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilicus,</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:220:104"/>
where all the intrails are knit together, the
Center, where all lines meet: and therefore in the
<hi>Creed</hi> of twelve Articles, ten of them concern him,
and beſide the other two of God the Father, and
the Holy Ghoſt, have their dependance on him
too, for he hath obtained the Spirit for us, and by
<hi>him we have acceſse unto the Father,</hi> as I ſhewed
before.</p>
               <p>And therefore as in the firſt book we learn, the
Croſſe begins the row, as though all the 24. Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were but Commentaries upon the Croſſe: ſo
ſurely, this is the ſumm of all our learning, to learn
to know <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> and him Crucified.</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>Chriſt is the Scope of all the Scriptures,</hi>
Me thinks, the Scripture is a Ring of Gold, which
<hi>Chriſt</hi> hath given his Spouſe the Church, as a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of his <hi>love,</hi> and himſelfe, like the Diamond
in the Ring: the Scripture is the field menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in the Goſpell, and <hi>Chriſt like the jewell in the
field,</hi> which <hi>a wiſe Merchant</hi> knowing of, would
<hi>ſell all he hath to purchaſe:</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> the <hi>box,</hi> and

the <hi>Word,</hi> as though every word ſounded of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
and all the Word of <hi>God</hi> were nothing elſe: and
<hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Alpha and Omega thereof, as himſelf
ſayes, <hi>Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end;</hi>
for all the Letters, without which the Spirit in the
Scripture breaths not, for ſo <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>In a word to cloſe up all, the</hi> knowledge of Chriſt

him we have acceſſe by one Spirit to the Father, being
no more ſtrangers, and forreiners, but fellow-Citizens

                  <hi>ſeminilegus,</hi> ſuch an one as they
that ſtood in the Corne-markets, and gathered up
the Corne that fell beſide the Sacks in emptying,
as <hi>Caſaubon</hi> obſerves, that is, a man of no worth, an
<hi>earthen veſſell,</hi> as the Apoſtle cals <hi>Miniſters</hi> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
and the word will beare it.</p>
               <p>I preſume the meaneſt in this place conceives
my meaning, yet I will endeavour to ſpeake more
plainly, that if there be any ſeeming riddle, you
may plow with my Heifer, as <hi>Sampſons</hi> compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
did, and reed the interpretations. I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
given you the explication of theſe words,
and ſo, as it were, threſhed the Corne out of the
eare, with the flaile of the Spirit: I come now to
the application in two parts.</p>
               <p>1. For <hi>confutation</hi> of popiſh errors, and ſo I will
chide away the chaffe out of this ſtoore with the
fanne of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>For</hi> exhortation, <hi>and ſo I will caſt the ſeed
into your eares, and charme it in the phraſe of the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:220:106"/>
Spouſe in the</hi> Canticles, Ariſe ô North, and come ô
South, and blow upon my Garden, that the Spices there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
may flow forth.</p>
               <p>In the Explication I have handled alreadie theſe
three points.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That</hi> Chriſt crucified is a ſufficient Saviour.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>That</hi> Chriſt Crucified is the ſumme of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
               <p>3. That <hi>Chriſt Crucified is the ſumm of Religion:</hi>
Which may ſtand as ſo many reaſons, to warrant
the wiſdome and equitie of <hi>Pauls</hi> determination,
to <hi>know nothing among the Corinthians, but Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
and him Crucified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now out of theſe ſhall be deduced, Firſt, for
<hi>Confutation:</hi> out of the firſt two things.</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>Saints are not Saviours,</hi> and therefore
not to be <hi>invocated</hi> as <hi>Saviours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That <hi>Sinners cannot be their owne Saviours;</hi>
and therefore, that our <hi>works</hi> on earth, are not <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>
of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Out of the ſecond, two things.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That</hi> the Scripture is moſt perfect, <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
needeth not to be patched up with Tradition.</p>
               <p>2. That <hi>the Scriptures are perſpicuous,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
neede not to be <hi>locked up from the Laitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the third, two things.</p>
               <p>1. How <hi>a man may know the true Religion,</hi> by
<hi>Chriſt</hi> the corner-ſtone, the <hi>Lydius lapis,</hi> the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
of Religion.</p>
               <p>2. How a man may unmaske Antichriſt, and
his counterfeit Religion, by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:220:106"/>
2. For <hi>Exhortation,</hi> out of all jointly.</p>
               <p>1. For <hi>Miniſters,</hi> what is the true Rule of
Preaching, the Art, (and that I may ſo ſpeak with
reverence) the very tricke of Preaching, <hi>viz.</hi> to
<hi>Preach Chriſt, and him crucified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. For all, what ſhould be all our chiefe ſtudy,
the aime and ſcope of all our ſtudies, <hi>viz.</hi> only to
know, believe, and love <hi>Chriſt Crucified.</hi> If any of
you think any of theſe too farre fet, rather haled
then drawn out of this Text, when I come to the
particulars, I hope to give him a reaſonable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
               <p>And thus I have drawne a Map of the holy
Land: or rather as God brought <hi>Moſes</hi> to the
top of Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> where he ſhewed him a ſight,
a <hi>Synopſis</hi> of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſo have I you:
but as it was then, ſo it is now, and ſo it will ever
be, we muſt travaile ſome dayes journies, before
we can enter into that good Land: we muſt winn
it, and weare it, we muſt fight with the enemies
of God, before we can fill our ſelves of the milke
and honey, of that Land which flowed with milke
and honey.</p>
               <p>Thus much I think I may be bold to ſay in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
that he that is indifferent, if he thinke advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
on the matter, will ſay, that I have taken an
indifferent courſe: I have taken theſe to try my
ſelfe, but I have refuſed more which I might have
taken, becauſe I would not tire my auditors: I
have ſelected theſe to exerciſe my meditations, out
of many other which I neglected, that I might
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:220:107"/>
not exceed the proportion of this exerciſe: for
who ſees not that <hi>Antichriſtianiſme</hi> is nothing
elſe but an <hi>oppoſition in a myſterie,</hi> to the myſterie of
<hi>godlineſſe</hi> revealed in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> either by open op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning,
or ſecret undermining: or if there be any
that cannot ſee, he may well heare the Proverb,
<hi>Who is ſo blind, as he that will not ſee:</hi> ſo that if I had
a minde to favour my ſelfe, I have a faire occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to make choiſe of mine enemie, among all the
troopes of the Romiſh Antichriſt, and ſingle out
the weakeſt: but I rather follow the direction of
the lot that is falne into my lap, and ſet upon him
that ſtands neareſt, though he ſtrout wide, and
ſpeake boiſtrous, and looke big with horrour and
diſdainfulneſſe.</p>
               <p>I remember, how <hi>David</hi> with a little ſtone
which he found by the brook, branded that proud
<hi>Goliah</hi> in the forehead, and foundred the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed
<hi>Philistim,</hi> that defied the Hoaſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
and the Lord of Hoaſts. And <hi>Daniel</hi> makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a ſtone that was cut out of the mountaine
without hands, which brake the glorious image
of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> whoſe head was of gold, the
armes and breaſts of ſilver, the thighs and legs of
braſſe, the feet of iron, (a man would think all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall)
and yet that little ſtone battered it all to pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Behold, I ſtand by the brooke of water, by
the book of God, for the <hi>Scripture is the river, that
makes glad the City of God:</hi> behold in theſe chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall
ſtreames, the ſtone, the <hi>Lord Chriſt,</hi> for <hi>Christ
is the ſtone</hi> which the proud builders of <hi>Babel</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:220:107"/>
but is become the head of the corner, which
the <hi>Maſter-builder</hi> hath put in <hi>Sion,</hi> and <hi>elect and
precious ſtone:</hi> me thinks I want nothing but <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
hand, or <hi>Davids</hi> ſling, to check the ſcornefull
Whore with a blow, and ſpoile the <hi>mysterie</hi> that is
written in her forehead: and yet againe me thinks
I need not <hi>Davids</hi> hand, ſince I have his ſtone: for
his ſtone is the ſame, that <hi>Daniels ſtone, and Daniels
ſtone</hi> (like the <hi>Phoenician</hi> ſhips in <hi>Homer</hi>) is guided
by an higher Intelligence, and can doe the feat
without hands: and as the ſtone without hands
intimates, according to our interpreters, the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie
of <hi>Mary,</hi> out of whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> was hewen,
without the help of man: ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> in my Text,
may be taken out without hands, without any
great paines of man, to breake the clay feet, the
brittle pillars of that braſen-faced Whore, to
breake them like a Potters veſſell. And though I
know the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councels,</hi> like <hi>Sauls Armour,</hi>
are not needfull for <hi>David</hi> in his combate: yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it were no hard matter for the happy cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,
when he hath foyled his enemy with a ſtone
out of the Scripture, and laid him grovelling in
the duſt, to ſet his victorious foot upon his necke,
and ſtrike off his head with the edge of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as it were with his owne ſword, in which he
gloried.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you wonder wher's the point all this
while: is that loſt? is that forgotten? tis true:
but I chooſe rather to leade you into my further
diſcourſe, though with an unſeaſonable preface,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:220:108"/>
then trouble you with an unſeemely repetition of
the former: though I might plead the preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of time, enough to ſecure me from exception or
obloquie: and yet I preſume that, with your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
conſtruction, I have erred indeed, but ſo
as not <hi>praeter caſam,</hi> no nor <hi>praeter cauſam</hi> neither.
I come now to it.</p>
               <p>The firſt point of the Explication was, that
<hi>Christ is a ſufficient Saviour:</hi> out of it I deduced,
1. <hi>That Saints are no Saviours,</hi> nor therefore to be
<hi>invocated as Saviours:</hi> here is no ſuch magneticall
and inviſible Sympathie, that any man ſhould
wonder what neceſſity tyes theſe two together:
neither is their any ſuch forced deduction, that a
man ſhould need to pumpe or cherne to make it
come: the dependance is eaſie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is in the links of
a chain, draw one, and the reſt will follow: as it is
in water ſpilt upon an even table, it is very docible
to go which way ſoever the finger will lead it; ſo
willingly doth this conſequent offer it ſelf to your
conſideration, out of the precedent poſition. Well
then, this is our Theme, for this time, that <hi>Saints
are not Saviours,</hi> nor therefore <hi>to be invocated as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours:</hi>
wherein I purpoſe firſt to repreſent unto
your view a light adumbration, a rude draught of
it, inſtead of an expoſition of the ſtate of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
which ſhall containe (as it were) a <hi>Sciagraphy</hi>
of the truth, and a <hi>Sciamachy</hi> againſt the falſhood:
I ſhall meaſure but three paces in this porch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I bring you into the maine building, the firſt
will be in the <hi>generall Idolatry of the Synagogue of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:220:108"/>
Rome,</hi> which offends againſt <hi>Chriſt crucified:</hi> the
ſecond, in that which is committed <hi>with the Saints
in generall:</hi> the laſt, in that which particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
the <hi>Virgin Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt: It was ſaid of old <hi>Rome,</hi> that it
was<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>The Epitomie of a Family, or rather of ſupersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
folly.</hi> But it is more true of new <hi>Rome:</hi> good
Lord! what a world of trinkets, and traſh, and
trumperie, is their great <hi>Coloſſus</hi> ſtuffed withall?
what <hi>apiſh imitation,</hi> what <hi>ſottiſh devotion,</hi> what
<hi>popiſh ſuperſtition</hi> is among them? inſomuch that
a man would doubt, whether he ſhould laugh, or
ſcorne, or abhorre thoſe fardels of folly; whether
hee ſhould laugh at the act, or weep for the actors;
whether he ſhould pity their ſimplicity, or ſpit at
their ſinfulneſſe.</p>
               <p>If ever the ſaying of the <hi>Preacher</hi> were verified
in ſimple truth, <hi>Vanitie of vanities, all is vanitie:</hi>
here it is more then true, and that with advantage,
by a kind of tranſcendent ſupereminency of truth,
<hi>Vanitie of vanities, all is vanitie:</hi> or if there be any
thing <hi>viler than vanitie,</hi> they ſhall vie with it for
vileneſſe: or if there be any thing <hi>lighter then va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi>
they ſhall weigh with them in the ballance
for lightneſſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Egyptian</hi> blindneſſe was nothing compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to this; the <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkneſſe, not halfe ſo
palpable: or if that were more palpable, I am
ſure, this is more culpable: The <hi>Egyptians</hi> worſhipt
vile creatures, but yet living creatures; the <hi>Romanes</hi>
worſhip ſtocks and ſtones, and dead carkaſes: they
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:220:109"/>
worſhip Oxen, and Owles, and Rats, and Mice,
and Cats, and Crocodiles, and ſuch like vermin:
theſe worſhip <hi>Iudas</hi> his Lanthorne, <hi>Francis</hi> his
Cowle, <hi>Beckets</hi> ſhooes, and <hi>Ioſephs</hi> breeches, and a
peece of ſtone that was in the Well where the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
Mary</hi> waſhed the ſwadling cloutes of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as
ſorry Saints I trow: They ſute at the Catadupes of
<hi>Nilus,</hi> and their heauy eares were made deafe with
his barbarous language, and (as it were) rockt
aſleep: there fell no dew from Heaven upon their
heads, that might wet their locks, that might ſoften
their rockey hearts, and make them bring forth
better fruits: no marvail then, if they worſhip <hi>Nilus,</hi>
whoſe ſteps dropt to them fatneſſe, whoſe rich in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation
filled their Vallies with Corne, and
crowned their yeares with gladneſſe, ſo are the
words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt:</hi> no marvaile if they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip't
<hi>Nilus,</hi> and that curſed vermin, the fruitfull
ſpawne of his too fruitfull wombe: but theſe men
are <hi>brought up at the feet of Gamaliel:</hi> and if they
did not preferr the ſeat of the ſcorners, they might
be preferred to the chaire of <hi>Moſes:</hi> they <hi>ſit in
the Temple of God,</hi> and heare the ſilver Trumpet of
the everlaſting Goſpell of God, proclaiming war
againſt ſuch idolatrie from the Lord of Hoaſts:
and yet they heare no more, then their ſtocks and
ſtones heare them: the dew of Heaven hath rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
falne among them, and yet like <hi>Gideons fleece,</hi>
they are dry, when all the Regions about them
are wet: their ſtubborn hearts remaine as hard as
the Adamant, to ſpeak with <hi>Iob, as hard as the nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
milſtone,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:220:109"/>
But I pray tell me, what is the ſumme of their
devotions, or, if you will heare me, I will tell you
what it is, by my caſting a ſmooth-faced ſmiling
picture, a Saintiſh ſtone, a rotten ragg of a naſtie
Relique, a B in a box, a Crucifixe I meane, a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
coſſet <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> theſe are the particulars, now
lay them altogether, and the Summe amounts to
this (if my Arithmetick faile me not) pretty mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,
pretty puppets for ſuch wanton babies as
they are to play withall, and as we uſe to promiſe
children fine gay things of nothing: this is the
ſumme of their devotion. Behold, theſe are thy
gods, ô thou ſonne of the rebellious woman, ô
thou daughter of <hi>Rome,</hi> thy gods in which thou
truſteſt: this is the precious merchandiſe that hath
drawne all the trafique of the World into thy
ſtreets, theſe are the Apples after which thy ſoule
luſteth.</p>
               <p>Pardon me, if theſe termes ſeeme ſomething
light: the toyes themſelves are ſo ridiculous, that
I could not finde in my heart to vouchſafe them
any graver ſpeech: but I will make amends, and
turn them all away packing: only let me remember
what your worthy Biſhop <hi>Claudius Taurinenſis</hi> ſaid
excellently of ſome of them your <hi>Agnus Deies, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctos
adorant, vivos devorant,</hi> I will make bold to
Engliſh it rudely, <hi>they worry the living Saints, while
they worſhip the dead:</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not ſay, <hi>Pinge
Agnos tuos,</hi> frame thee Lambs that may repreſent
me, but <hi>Paſce agnos meos, Feed the Lambes</hi> that doe
repreſent me: but it ſeemes they do not much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:220:110"/>
what hee ſaid: and yet he did not only ſay
thus, but he conjured them alſo with the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
charme of love, if thou love me (<hi>Peter) feed
my Lambs:</hi> and yet theſe devout adorers, like <hi>deafe
Adders, ſtop their eares and will not heare the charmer,
charme he never ſo wiſely.</hi> I conclude this point:
As <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> once anſwered him that asked,
what his ſonne ſhould be the better for learning, if
he beſtowed it on him: <hi>Vt nihil aliud</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tè
in Theatro non ſedebit lapis ſuper lapidem:</hi> ſo may I
make anſwer to him that ſhould demand, what
ſhould any man be the better to <hi>come out of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
out of <hi>Rome,</hi> and betake himſelfe into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
of the faithfull Spouſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> our Church,
our Religion: <hi>Vt nihil aliud certè, in Templo non ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
lapis ad lapidem,</hi> blocks ſhall not proſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
before blocks, nor ſtones proſtitute
themſelves to ſtones, living ſtones, to liveleſſe
ſtones; ſenſitive blocks, before ſenſleſſe blocks,
beſide a thouſand priviledges.</p>
               <p>And thus I paſſe to take the ſecond ſtep, which
was concerning <hi>Saints in generall. Bellarmine</hi> hath
a very tragicall and paſſionate preface to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie:
hee fals fowle with us Proteſtants, hee
termes us ſcoffing <hi>Lucians,</hi> and Gyants, that make
warre againſt the Gods, and ſuch like flowers of
his wild Rhetorick, <hi>Canina facundia,</hi> dogged elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
he beſtowes upon us: and perhaps he was
at great coſt to gather them, but we conne little
thanks: and then like ſome deſperate Fencer, that
hath more heart then braine, more malice then
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:220:110"/>
might, he hewes, and laſhes, and foynes, and
ſtrikes blindfold, he cares not where, and hits he
cares not whom: or like ſome mad dogg, he hath
a quarrell to every one he meets: he grins at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſmus,</hi>
he ſnarles at <hi>Melancthon,</hi> and barkes at <hi>Illy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus,</hi>
and ſnatches at <hi>Luther,</hi> and worries <hi>Calvin,</hi>
as though hee had to deale with ſome carion car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe;
this is the only difference, the teeth of a mad
dogg are poiſon, but his tongue is no ſlander: at
laſt, as a man newly awaked out of a trance or
ſleepe, he throwes his envious eyes to heaven
with great devotion, (forſooth) and wonders why
the ſtarres are ſuffered to ſtand there, belike hee
thinks to convince their workes of darkneſſe: hee
wonders at the patience of God that ſuffers us he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
to diſcover their Catholick abominations,
in the falſe worſhip of Saints, and vindicate the
glory of God, from their impudent impoſtures.
Me thinks, this preface is like the Painters Table.
One ſpake to a Painter to draw him a Horſe run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in full ſpeed: he did, and gave it him, but
gave it with the wrong ſide upward: the man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked
it, and told him, he ſpake for a runner, this
was a tumbler, no hurt, quoth the Painter, turne
the Table and this will runne: ſo in that Preface,
all may be true, but all is turned upſide downe;
like the Horſe with his heeles upward, ſprawling
toward Heaven: but change the perſons, and let
that bee ſaid of the Papiſts, that hee would faine
make the world believe is true of the Proteſtants,
and I blame not the Picture: or as the Painter ſaid,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:220:111"/>
turne the Table, and all may runne well enough, or
at leaſt go currant. But what if we ſhould let the
Jeſuite goe, perhaps he had as live be ſome where
elſe, and as live be doing ſomething elſe, as bee
brought in for a tumbler to play tricks: if you
thinke ſo, I am content to diſmiſſe him: well then,
to leave the Cardinall, and come to the cauſe.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts have brought in ſo many new Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours,
that the true Saviour is gone out: I know
not how they will find Heaven, but I am ſure, they
have loſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they have loſt the way to Heaven:
for he is the <hi>way.</hi> And if there be any ſpark of faith,
any remnant of the faithfull flocke among them,
they may well complain, as <hi>Mary</hi> did to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener,
when ſhe went to viſite the ſacred body of
the Lord, and found it not, <hi>Sir, they have taken away
my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him:</hi>
if there be (I ſay) any faithfull <hi>Mary</hi> among them,
like <hi>a Lilie among thornes,</hi> which led with an holy
zeale indeed, but miſled by ignorance, ſhould
thinke to find him in their crowd of Saints, wrapt
up in ſome of their reliques, as he was once in lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin
cloaths, I thinke ſome Angell would tell her,
as he did, <hi>He is not here;</hi> I thinke <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe
would take the paines to meet her, and inſtruct her
thus: <hi>Mary,</hi> I ſee thou meaneſt well, but yet thou
miſſeſt much, thou art in a right mind, but thou
art in a wrong box: it is but loſt labour to ſeeke
<hi>the living among the dead, the living Saviour, among
the dead Saints:</hi> I would have thee know therefore,
I have retired my ſelfe from this Garden, and ſhall
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:220:111"/>
not feed any more among theſe Lillies, <hi>but untill
the day breake and the ſhadowes flee away, I go, my wel-beloved,
I go to the mountain of ſpices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why do I preſume as it were to teach <hi>Chriſt</hi>
to ſpeake, who is the <hi>word,</hi> in whom God ſpeakes
to us? or why doe I relate his ſpeech, who am <hi>a
child and know not how to ſpeake?</hi> I know the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
taxe <hi>Homers</hi> raſhneſſe, in reporting the ſong
of the Sirens, becauſe it cannot be thought, how it
ſhould be done, but it muſt needs fall many bowes
ſhort of expectation: ſuch things are better ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,

               <p>The word of God, in the deſcription of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Land, hath foure things obſervable in the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
line that directs our paſſage thither: two for
the <hi>way,</hi> and two for the <hi>end:</hi> for the way,</p>
               <p>1. That it is <hi>ſtreight</hi> without crooke.</p>
               <p>2. That it is <hi>narrow</hi> without croud.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>end,</hi> that the gate of the Royall City,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:220:112"/>
1. Is <hi>narrow,</hi> 2. Is <hi>one:</hi> but the Popes Itinerary,
made out of the lying Legend, the coſoning
Calender, the Ephemerides of the Saints, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
the Kings map, the word of God in all theſe:
there is a <hi>lying ſpirit gone out,</hi> and gone into the
mouths of the Prophets of <hi>Iezebel,</hi> to ſend <hi>Ahab</hi>
upon an unhappy voyage: and as the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi>
ſpies, (all beſide <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua</hi>) ſpake evill of
the good Land, ſo the Romiſh ſpies, which they
have ſent to view this Land, ſpeake falſe of the
true way, which the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God muſt walke
in, if they meane to come to the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. They have made the <hi>way crooked:</hi> As the
man in the Goſpell that offered himſelf to follow
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> would faine have taken a vagarie, and
fetched a circuit by his fathers houſe, that hee
might <hi>have ſaluted him, and bidden him farewell</hi>
with a kiſſe: and another, would have viſited his
fathers tombe, and ſeen him honourably interred,
whereas they ſhould have followed <hi>Chriſt</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
ſo the Papiſts will not goe the neareſt way to
Heaven, by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but will needs coaſt about, by
the <hi>Sepulchers of Saints,</hi> for feare belike, that if they
ſhould make too much haſte, they, ſhould come
too ſoone thither: But the Lord commands us,
<hi>to make ſtreight ways for our ſteppes,</hi>

                  <hi>every greazie

Temple) would make a ſtay at every greene hill,
and everyſhadie grove (the Lord complains thus)
as ye have ſeen ſome hackney Jades at every green
banck, with a moneths minde to bait there, and
ſteale a ſweet bit, a mouthfull of Idolatry.</p>
               <p>2. They <hi>have made the way wide.</hi> You know
the man who ſaid, he would not leave his part in
<hi>Paris,</hi> for his part in <hi>Paradiſe:</hi> And I thinke it
not impoſſible to finde ſome daintie minion in the
Whores lap, that would not exchange his <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nals
Hat,</hi> for a <hi>Martyrs Crowne.</hi> But for this time,
we will thinke, that they thinke at leaſt, that they
would come to heaven: But when they heare
<hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaying, <hi>I am the way,</hi> they thinke in their
conſcience that's too narrow; and when they heare
him ſay plainly, <hi>that the way is narrow,</hi> they ſay
plainly that's <hi>an hard ſaying, who can beare it?</hi> And as
the <hi>young man that came to Christ,</hi> went away griev'd
at a like ſpeech: ſo they are grieved indeed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were as covetous as he was: but they
will not goe away becauſe they are not ſo ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as hee was. But why was the young man
grieved, and why are they grieved, as the young
man was? becauſe he was <hi>rich,</hi> becauſe they are
<hi>riotous:</hi> they are afraid that narrow way will not
receive their goodly traine, their great retinue:
fond men, that cannot be contented to <hi>go to heaven,</hi>
except they <hi>goe in ſtate:</hi> very fooles, that will not
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:220:113"/>
(as the Proverb is) leave their bables for the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of London, their towers of <hi>Bable</hi> for the <hi>Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
that will not ſhake hands with that <hi>folly,</hi> that they
imbrace this <hi>felicitie.</hi> But why will not they goe
away as the young man did? hee was a young
man they thinke, and they are grown gray in miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
deviſes: they meane to try concluſions
ere they goe away. What doe they then? they
hire a raſcall rout of hungry ditchers to breake up
the fence, that the word hath made, to make the
way broader then the merits of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and then
they eke it out with the forged merits of Saints:
and being ſo drunken with ſuperſtition, that they
cannot paſſe the lake that burnes with fire and
brimſtone for evermore, upon that one planck of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> as they ſay the barbarous Turkes doe,
when they meet a deepe river in the way that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupts
their courſe, they ſlay their poore vaſſals,
and make a bridge of their dead corps: ſo they
inlarge that bridg with the rotten boords of Saints
mediation: but it is to be feared, that while they,
in their Pontificall fancies imagine the bridge (by
their deceitfull moone-ſhine) wider then it is, they
find themſelves deeper then they would, plunged
in that <hi>Lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone for
evermore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>They have made the gatewider:</hi> They are ſo
cram'd with the ſinnes of the people, and fed ſo
fat with their <hi>follies,</hi> and ſo puft up with the winde
of <hi>pride,</hi> that they have no hope to get into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
if all that get in muſt do as <hi>Christ</hi> ſaid, <hi>Strive
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:220:113"/>
to enter into the ſtrait gate:</hi> beſide their great.
Maſter would faine have the gate ſo large, that he
might goe in with full ſoope, top and top-gallant,
without <hi>vailing his triple crowne,</hi> or bending his
ſtubborn knees: for he is as ſtiffe as though he had
eaten a ſtake: his joynts are like the Elephants,
they are no joynts: and like <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
their leggs are of braſſe, they cannot bow, ſo
much as to him that made them: they are like
ſome nice and cold hearers of the word, that are
willing to heare and make toward the Church
(perhaps they made a ſhort dinner for haſte) but
when they come there, and ſee a little doore beſet
with a great throng about it, they ſhrinke their
heads into their ſhell againe: they meant to heare,
but they never meant to croud for the matter:
the Cat loves fiſh, but will not wet her foot: they
had rather ſwell and putrifie, and die with ſin and
ignorance, then be ſo ſweezed. But what doe they
in this caſe to helpe themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they have ſet on
worke many skilfull Carpenters (perhaps ſome
apprentiſes of that jolly Carpenter, that made a
gate of a window by his learned interpretation of
a place in the <hi>Acts</hi>) they have furniſhed them
with ſtore of timber out of the Popes ſtorehouſe
of Saints Reliques, and theſe have promiſed to
give ſo much ſcope to the gate, that the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
bellies may ſtep in and not complaine for
want of elbow-roome.</p>
               <p>4. They <hi>have made many gates inſtead of one:</hi>
The Grammer of the Goſpell writes it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

I am the doore,</hi> not the doores: <hi>I am, and no other,</hi> as
the Lord ſpeaketh in another place: But theſe
fooliſh <hi>Florentines,</hi> (I think <hi>Florentines,</hi> I know
fooliſh) theſe fooliſh <hi>Florentines,</hi> have a ſtrong
conceit, upon a weak ground, that the more gates
go out of their City, the more gaine comes in, and
therefore have made <hi>ſo many Saints as are gone to
heaven,</hi> ſo many <hi>gates to goe to heaven.</hi> Excellently
ſaith the Spirit of God in the <hi>Revelation, Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
21. <hi>and the 21. And the twelve gates were
twelve Pearles,</hi> every ſeverall gate was one Pearle:
the tranſlation abates ſomething of the worth, for
thoſe Pearles in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> are <hi>Margarites</hi> in <hi>Greek,</hi>
and thoſe <hi>Margarites</hi> are the beſt of Pearles, and
repreſent <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe, and that moſt ſweetly:
for thoſe <hi>Margarites</hi> are begotten of the divine
influence of the ſtarres, and conceived of the pure
dew of Heaven, though a poore ſhell gives them
entertainment: ſo was <hi>Christ the Sonne of the moſt
High,</hi> begotten by his eternall father, and conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Holy Ghoſt, though he did not <hi>abhorre
the wombe of the Virgin,</hi> though the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>
brought him forth.</p>
               <p>But here ſeemes to be many gates. I pray mark:
there is a <hi>double number,</hi> and a <hi>double unitie:</hi> there
is a <hi>number</hi> of twelve, and a <hi>number</hi> of three: of
twelve, round about for the twelve tribes of <hi>Iſrael:</hi>
of three, on each ſide for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the world, three to the Eaſt, three to the
Weſt, three to the North, three to the South:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:220:114"/>
twelve, that the fulneſſe of the <hi>Iewes</hi> may come in
by thoſe gates; three, that the fulneſſe of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
may come in and ſit <hi>with Abraham in the
Kingdome of God.</hi> Againe, there is a <hi>double unitie,</hi>
an <hi>unitie of matter,</hi> all theſe gates are made of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garites:</hi>
an <hi>unity of forme,</hi> they are all made of one
<hi>Margarite</hi> a peece; and that <hi>Margarite</hi> I told you
was <hi>Chriſt:</hi> ſo that in effect, there be many goers,
but one gate: there be many <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> to
enter,<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>this gate will receive them all,</hi> both <hi>Iewes</hi>
and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that ſhall be gathered from all the
foure winds of the earth.</p>
               <p>This is the gate which the Angell of God hath
meaſured with his golden reed: but the leaden
meetwand of the Popes Canonization hath laid
us our gates made of the rotten wood of Saints, if
it did but chance to glow a little in a gloomy night
of darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>I will end now this point of <hi>Saints in generall.</hi>
We read of ſome that <hi>take the Kingdome of Heaven

and yet theſe men are commended: for it ſuffers

but we doe not read of any that <hi>crept into the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,</hi>
but <hi>thievs and robbers,</hi> and they are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:220:115"/>
but ſuch thieves and robbers are the Papiſts,
that thinke to ſteale in by the windowes of Saints
prayers: and that when the gate ſtands wide open,
when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtands forth and invites all, <hi>Come unto
me, all yee that are heavie laden, and I will eaſe you:</hi>
and yet theſe thievs had rather pray to Saints, and
neglect <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But me thinks, their prayers without Chriſt,
are like the womans Beere, when ſhe forgat to
put in the Malt: they are prayers of their owne
brewing, and they are like to drinke as they brew,
faint beere, faint prayers, thin beere, thin prayers.
What if they be ſtrong of the Hop of Saints, yet
when there is no graine of faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not ſo
much as a graine of Muſtard-ſeed in them, I hope
I may well terme them thin beere, thin prayers,
faint beere, faint prayers. Let me then ſay to them,
Behold, theſe are thy Saviours, ô thou ſonne of
the rebellious woman, ô thou daughter of <hi>Rome,</hi>
thy Saviours in whom thou truſteſt: and let mee
ſay to you, <hi>Sonne of man, ſeest thou theſe abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</hi>
then learne to ſay with me, O the patience

               <p>Follow me but a little further with your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and I will ſhew you <hi>greater abominations then
theſe:</hi> for now I come to the third ſtep, concerning
their <hi>Idolatry with the Virgin Mary</hi> in particular.
<hi>Revelation</hi> 9. There is mention made of a <hi>bread of
Locuſts out of the ſmoake of the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> which
are at large deſcribed there: among other, this is
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:220:115"/>
one particular, that they have womens haire, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the judgement of learned Interpreters:
theſe <hi>Locuſts</hi> typifie the flocks of <hi>Eaſterne Saracens'</hi>
and the <hi>Westerne ſwarmes of Monkes:</hi> but how can
ſhaven crownes (for ſo Monkes are, and it went
before, that they had like crownes upon their
heads, which notes, that round ſhaving in forme
of a crowne, which was indeed as precious as a
crowne to them, to keepe them ſacred and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable)
how can thoſe bald-pates be ſaid to have
womens haire? yes, not litterally, but myſtically;
becauſe they gloried in <hi>womens haire:</hi> the thing
is plaine in ſtorie. The <hi>Saracens</hi> deſcended indeed
of <hi>Hagar</hi> the bond-woman, as it were of purpoſe
to verifie this type, will needs be called <hi>Saracens,</hi>
of <hi>Sarah the free woman:</hi> and ſo they boaſt of their
womens haire. And who knowes not, how the
Monks brag of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and ſo their
bare skuls have borrowed a periwig (as it were) of
womens haire. But what doe they with it? As
the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Matrons once ſuffered themſelvs
willingly to be ſhorne, that the men might make
Engines of their haire, for the defence of their

                  <hi>Mary;</hi> as they did ſcoffingly, whether <hi>Alexander</hi>
were gracious with <hi>Hephaeſtion: Mary</hi> hath all the
ſutors, <hi>Mary</hi> hath all the preſents, <hi>Mary</hi> doth all in
the Court of Heaven. It is not here, as it was once
ſaid of <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> his ſonne, that he ruled all
<hi>Greece,</hi> becauſe his father ruled all, and his mother
ruled his father, and he ruled his mother: For the
Popes Sophiſti call Logick in a <hi>Sorites,</hi> and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Rhetorick in a <hi>Climax,</hi> is cleane contrary:
God rules the World, his Sonne rules him, and
<hi>Mary</hi> rules his Sonne; therefore <hi>Mary</hi> rules the
World. She is become, againſt the <hi>Lex Salica,</hi> I
am ſure, againſt the <hi>Lex Coelica,</hi> the new Queene
of Heaven, at leaſt, as though her ſonne were in his
minority, the Queene Regent. She complaines
her ſelf in <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> that ſhe hath ſo many Clyents,
ſo much cuſtome, <hi>tantum non enecant,</hi> ſhee hath
much adoe to take reſpite enough, to take breath
enough, to keepe life and ſoule together: belike
they meane to kill her with kindneſſe, to preſſe her
to death with loads of honour; as the perfidious
Virgin was ſerved that betrayed the Capitoll:
they come ſomething neare alreadie, <hi>tantum non
enecant.</hi> But if there be any that make ſhew to <hi>kiſſe
the Sonne,</hi> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeakes, it is to be feared,
that it is not becauſe they are <hi>afraid-least he, but leſt
ſhe be angry:</hi> or according to our commonſpeech,
many kiſſe the child for the nurſes ſake: they kiſſe
the child, but their mouth waters at the mothers
lips, they make much of the child and dandle it in
their armes, but it is but to inſinuate themſelves
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:220:117"/>
into the ſweet embraces of the mother.</p>
               <p>And yet theſe filthie monſters of luſt (for they
are no better then monſters, bewitched out of the
ſhape of men, by the powerfull charmes of
the Romiſh <hi>Circe,</hi> and her golden Cup offorni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation)
theſe filthie monſters do ſo pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

and thinke it ſtrange, that we doe not runne with them
into the ſame exceſſe of riot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Like ſome fond and amorous Bridegroome
newly wedded, that dotes may chance upon an
homely ſpouſe, and wonders that all his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
doe not meet him with their mouths full of
wonder and gratulation, that they doe not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
her whom he adores: becauſe forſooth, ſhee
is written for a Saint in the Calender of his heart,
he thinks ſhe ſhould be received for a Queene in
the Charter of their Pariſh: becauſe ſhe is the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll
of his fancie, he thinks ſhe ſhould be the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe
of their faith: he is ſo well acquainted with
the zeale of his owne private devotion, that hee
cannot but admire, what cold blaſt of ſtupid igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
or envie, (for he hath not the power to think
it any other) hath ſo frozen and congeald them,
that they do not melt into his mold, that they will
not be reduced to his temperature.</p>
               <p>But to give them their anſwer. The <hi>Old Iewes
baked for the Queene of Heaven,</hi> and the New Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyridians
did the like for the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> whom

               <p>If they could but open their eyes, I doubt not,
but they might ſee <hi>that we give more to the Virgin
then they,</hi> that we are not Hereticks, becauſe wee
doe not give ſo much to the Virgin as they doe;

and yet to ſay truth, we give her more then they

he <hi>ſpeakes the word of God in truth, without reſpect of

Doctrine, let him be accurſed:</hi> and though he refuſe

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:220:124"/>
For as it was ſaid of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that while he reſtored
the ſtatutes of <hi>Pompey,</hi> he eſtabliſhed his owne: ſo
while he reſerves to God the <hi>propriety</hi> of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,

Angels are not to be adored, therefore much leſſe
Saints: to make a compound of the double Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis:
Angels are not to be adored, therefore
much more Saints are not to be invocated.</p>
               <p>The fourth place is, 1 <hi>Timoth. 2. 5. For there is
one God, and one Mediator betweene God and Men, the

We have three things in this Text worth obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,

Atheiſme to ſet up more then one Mediator, as it
is to ſet up more then one God.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>ſecret deſcription of a Mediator,</hi> he muſt
be one betweene God and Man, that is, <hi>both God

                  <hi>Mediator,</hi> the true <hi>Ieſus,</hi> that can

3. It followes, <hi>who gave himſelfe a ranſome for
all,</hi> which is like that which I noted before in <hi>Iohn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might adde a fourth out of the Context: that
<hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of a <hi>Mediator of interceſsion</hi> only, for
hee had before recited, that prayers ſhould bee
made for all men, and now he directs to the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
in whoſe name theſe prayers muſt be offered,
that they may be acceptable to God, and ſayes
plainly, there is but one Mediator, and that one is
<hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which may ſerve to ſtop the mouth of <hi>Papiſts,</hi>
which think to elude all with a diſtinction of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators

<hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Mediator of Redemption, <hi>Saints</hi> may
be of interceſſion: if theſe men did ſpeake ſo wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as they might, and think ſo truly as they ought,
yet we might ſay to them, as the Artificer did,
that wrought finely, but ſpake meanely, when hee

                  <hi>their deeds ſpeak more then their

               <p>But they do not ſpeake well, and yet they mean
worſe: therefore I will endeavour to anſwer them.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Populus non diſtinguit,</hi> is an Axiom in Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks:
the peoples gowtie fingers, cannot handle
the ſlender threads of theſe daintie diſtinctions,
(which theſe ſubtile ſpinners make) ſo tenderly,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:220:125"/>
but they will be in great danger of breaking: and
ſo while theſe ſupplanting Jeſuites are counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting
<hi>Iacobs ſmooth voice</hi> (that I may alter the
ſtorie a little) the poore peoples hands are rough
and horrid with ſuperſtition, as <hi>Eſaus</hi> were: and it
were hard to ſay which are in the better caſe: <hi>The
people draw in iniquitie with cart-ropes of vanitie,</hi> (as
the fooliſh <hi>Trojans</hi> did the fatall Horſe into their
Citie) and ſo go down to the pit directly: The Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites
ſpin a fine thread out of their brain (as the
Spiders do, out of their bellie) and upon that
they thinke to climb to Heaven as wiſely: Or like
two Buckets at a Well, the people are like to that
which goes down in a rope directly; the Jeſuite as
the other, ſeems to be comming up (not upon that
thick rope, for he ſees the other go down in it) but
he thinks to winch himſelfe up upon a ſilly thread.</p>
               <p>I think the people in the better caſe, for though
they go down in the rope, yet they go emptie, and
the rope (as it were) moderates the violence of the
fall, ſo that they are not like to ſinck ſo deep: but
the Jeſuite comming up full upon his ſlender
thread (ſuppoſe hee ſhould wind himſelfe a little

cannot chooſe but breake, and then hee cannot

The poore King of the <hi>Indians,</hi> when he heard

let him claime the right of diſpoſſeſſing Princes,

theſe figg-leaves? why doth he rend the ſeameles

               <p>The fifth. <hi>Eph. 3. 12. In whom we have acceſſe
and boldneſſe, with confidence by the faith in him: in

according to our tranſlation, we have not ſo much
as any acceſſe to God the Father, but by <hi>Chriſt,
who is the way and the doore:</hi> I think the word may
be rendred <hi>Preſentation,</hi> I am ſure, the thing is ſaid

may well call the <hi>mountaine of viſion,</hi> as the lower

that ſhould returne richly laden, with the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

and tremble and tremble, till it come to <hi>Chriſt;</hi>
who will rebuke the Fever, and heale the Palſie:
and then it will ſtand ſtill, and ſtand with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
for <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a <hi>Magneticall rock</hi> whoſe attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
grace it is that drives it thither: and the houſe
of faith is builded upon that rocke: let the raine
fall, and the Windes riſe, and the Sea rage, it ſtands
unmovable, like to Mount <hi>Sion</hi> that cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved:
and why, becauſe it is builded on a Rock.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts then that goe without this faith in
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> may come with a <hi>ſhivering of feare,</hi> but they
cannot come with <hi>boldneſse:</hi> or, that we may be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall

they cannot come with <hi>boldneſse:</hi> for in <hi>Chriſt</hi> wee
<hi>have acceſse with boldneſſe,</hi> faith the <hi>Apostle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus farre have I exerciſed my ſelfe in the
Scripture: if any ſay, I might have made choiſe
of more and more pregnant places. I anſwer: that
I thinke theſe pregnant enough, and I know this
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:220:128"/>
truth impregnable, and therefore I need not be
very ſcrupulous.</p>
               <p>You have heard how the Papiſts <hi>diſhonour
Chriſt crucified,</hi> by the honour that they give to
Saints canonized: the Saints that have gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, are indeed a <hi>cloud of glorious witneſſes,</hi> as
the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeakes to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> wherewith we,
who are the ſonnes of promiſe, are encompaſſed
in our journey: but they comming after them,
have made them a <hi>cloud of groſſe idolatry,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſſe,</hi> is
<hi>eclipſed</hi> in his glory: You have heard in particular
how they commit folly with the <hi>Virgin Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I touched that point but ſparingly: but if a man
would take the paines to turne over their ſtinking
Roſaries, but halfe ſo much as they do their beads
in a day, he ſhould ſoone perceive that the <hi>name of
Chriſt</hi> is out of faſhion, out of date, and <hi>the name
of the Virgin</hi> in the freſheſt honour: the withered
lawrels of Chriſt are faine to vaile the bonnet, and
give place to the flouriſhing, prime, and greene
garlands of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> as <hi>Lucullus</hi> did once to
<hi>Pompeyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if there be any that make ſhew <hi>to kiſſe the
Sonne,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, it is to be feared,
that it is not becauſe they are afraid <hi>leaſt he,</hi> but
<hi>leaſt ſhe be angry:</hi> or, according to our common
ſpeech, Many kiſſe the child for the mothers ſake:
they kiſſe the child, but their mouth waters at the
mothers lips: they make much of the child, and
dandle it in their armes, but it is but to inſinuate
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:220:129"/>
themſelves into the ſweet imbraces of the
mother.</p>
               <p>And yet theſe filthy monſters, of luſt (for they
are no better than monſters, bewitched out of the
ſhape of men by the powerfull charmes of the
<hi>Romiſh Circe,</hi> and her golden cup of fornication)
theſe filthy monſters do ſo pleaſe themſelves in
their filthineſſe, that, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>they ſpeak
evill of us, as of thoſe that doe evill, and thinke it
ſtrange that we do not run with them into the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſse
of riot.</hi> Like ſome fond and amarous bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome
newly wedded, that dotes, may chance,
upon an homely ſpouſe, and wonders that all his
neighbours do not meet him with their mouthes
full of wonder and gratulation: that they do not
worſhip her whom he adores: becauſe, forſooth,
ſhe is written for a <hi>Saint</hi> in the Calender of his
heart, he thinks ſhe ſhould be received for a <hi>Queen</hi>
in the Charter of their Pariſh: becauſe ſhe is the
<hi>idoll</hi> of his fancy, he thinks ſhe ſhould be the <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe</hi>
of their faith: he is ſo well acquainted with
the zeale of his owne private devotion, that he
cannot but admire what cold blaſt of ſtupid igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
or envie (for he hath not the power to think
it any other) hath ſo frozen and congeal'd their
dull ſpirits, that his Sun doth not melt them into
his mold, that they will not be reduced to his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature.</p>
               <p>But the truth is, as I ſaid before, we give more
unto the Virgin, that they do: they would have
her <hi>worſhipfull,</hi> we would have her <hi>honourable:</hi> an
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:220:129"/>
                  <hi>eaſie Herald</hi> would decide the controverſie, which
were the better title: and an <hi>eaſie Divine,</hi> which
were the <hi>Antidicomarianitae,</hi> they or we: but it is a
fit of <hi>frenzie,</hi> not of <hi>love,</hi> that tranſporteth them:
the untamed horſes of diſtempered paſſion, as <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
cals them, have ſo hurried and whirled about
the crazie chariot of their reaſon, that they have
frighted them out of their little wits, and ſet the
wheeles of judgement (upon which they ſhould
have run ſteadily) quite beſide the ſocket.</p>
               <p>And therefore we have taken ſuch a courſe
with them, as, you know, 1. We have cal'd
upon them by a generall diſcourſe, as faithfull
friends, to reclaime them from this folly. 2. We
have ſet the Scripture, as a grave over-ſeer, to
frowne upon them, and chide them into their wits
againe: this hath done little good yet; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt now try the laſt remedy: if they
will not learne of the word at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> we muſt
ſend them to ſchoole to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> (a place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for men in their caſe) and there ſet Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
like a ſevere maſter, to diſple them every day,
and whip their wandring wits from place to place,
(as they do vagabonds) till they returne to the
place from whence they came, and regaine
the ſeat of their Nativity, together
with the Scepter of their
Regencie.</p>
