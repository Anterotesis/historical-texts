         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The illustrations which they bring to justifie this manner of speech, did the time permit, I could retort upon themselves, and make them speake more plainly for my opinion, than for theirs. It shall be sufficient by the way to note the imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie of the application, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the instances brought, were in themselves justifiable by the illustrations they bring: or how little it could weaken our assertion, although it might intercept all the strength or aid this place affords for the fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it. What can it helpe them to turne these words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they make towards us,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1251:11"/>
from their ordinary or usuall meaning, or to restraine Gods love only unto such as are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; when as the current of it in other passages of Scripture is evidently extended unto such as perish? In stead of many words uttered by him that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie, unto this purpose, those few, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 11. shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent mee: <hi>As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turne from his way and live: turne yee, turne yee from your evill wayes; for why will yee die, Oh house of Israel?</hi> If God minde the safety of <hi>such as perish,</hi> yea even of most <hi>desperate</hi> and <hi>stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne sinners:</hi> no question but he

                  </p>
                  <p>The former distinction then will not stop this passage.

Hee had power, no doubt, in his hands, to have dispensed with this particular, without any danger to his person. And most Princes would have done as much as they could for the safety of their successour. Nor could privileges or indulgences upon such speciall circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be held as breaches or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of publike lawes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the prerogative of the person offending cannot be drawne into example. But <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus</hi> could not be brought to dispense with his law, because he loved justice no lesse dearly than his Sonne, whom he loved as dearly as himselfe. And to manifest the equality of his love
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1251:28"/>
to all three, hee caused one of his owne eyes, and another of his sonnes to be put out: that so the law might have her due, though not wholly from his Sonne that had offended; but in part from himselfe, as it were by way of punishment for this partiality towards his Sonne.</p>
                  <p>It were possible no doubt for a King to reclaime many inferiours from theft, from rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, or other ungracious cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; so hee would vouchsafe to abate his owne expences to maintaine theirs, or afford them the solaces of his Court, make them his Peeres, or otherwise allow them meanes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe their wonted pleasures.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1251:28"/>
But thus farre to descend to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifty subjects humors, were ill beseeming that Majestie and gravity which should bee in Princes. If one should give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to a Prince how easie and possible it were to him by these meanes, to save a number from the gallowes: his replie would be, <hi>Princeps id potest quod salva Majestate potest: That onely is possible to a Prince, which can stand with the safety of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie:</hi> but thus to feed the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable appetites of greedy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifts (though otherwise such as hee loves most dearly, and whose welfare he wishes as heartily as they doe that speake for them) is neither Princely nor
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1251:29"/>
majesticall. For a King in this case to doe as much as by his authority or other meanes hee is able to doe, were an act of weaknesse and impotencie, not an act of Soveraigne power; a great blot to his wisdome, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and dignity; no true ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of royall love or Princely Clemencie.</p>
                  <p>In like manner we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that God, albeit in power infinite, yet his infinite power is matched with goodnesse as truly infinite; his infinite love, as it were, counterpoised with infinite Majestie. And though his infinite mercy be as Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne to his orher Attributes: yet is it in a sort restrained by
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1251:29"/>
the tribunitiall power of his justice. This equality of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitenesse betwixt his attributes being considered, the former difficulty is easily resolved. If it be demanded whether God could not make a thousand worlds, as good or better than this: it were infidelity to deny it, why? Because this is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of meere power; and might be done without any contradiction to his goodnesse, to his Majestie to his mercy or justice: all which it might serve to set forth. And this is a Rule of faith, <hi>that all effects of meere power, though greater than wee can conceive as possible, may be done of him with greater ease, than we can
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1251:30"/>
breath.</hi> His onely Word would suffice to make ten thousand worlds. But if it be questioned, whether God could not have don more than he hath done for his Vineyard, whether he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not save such as dayly perish: the case is altered, and breeds a fallacy <hi>Ad plures interrogationes.</hi> For mans salvation is no worke of meere power: it necessarily requires a harmony of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, of majesty, of mercy and justice, whereunto the infinite power is in a manner subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Nor are we to consider his infinite power alone, but as matched with infinite majesty; nor his infinite mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse alone, but as matched with
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1251:30"/>
infinite justice. And in this case it is as true of God as man; <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us id potest, quod salva Majestate potest; quod salva bonitate &amp; ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitia potest: God can doe that which is not prejudiciall to his Majestie, to his goodnesse and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</hi> And hee had done (if wee may beleeve his oath) as much for his vineyard, as the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of his infinite power and wisdome could effect without disparagement to the infinitie of his Majestie, or that internall law or rule of infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, whereby hee created man after his owne image and simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude.</p>
                  <p>God as he hath his being, so hath he his goodnesse of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1251:31"/>
and his goodnesse is his being: as impossible therefore, that he should not be good, as not be. Man, as he had his life and being, so had he his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse wholly from his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. And as actuall existence is no part nor necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his essence: so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is his goodnesse necessarie or essentiall to his existence. As his existence, so his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is mutable: the one neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily including a possibilitie of declination or decay; the other an inclination of relapse, or falling into evill. As he was made after the similitude of God, he was actually and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently good. Yet was not his
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1251:31"/>
goodnesse essentiall, necessarie or immutable. Nor did hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble his Creator in these es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall attributes: but rather in the exercise of them <hi>ad extra.</hi> Now the exercise of them was not necessarie, but free in the Creator. For God might have continued for ever Most holy, righteous and good in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, albeit hee had never crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man, nor other creature. Wherefore hee made them good, as hee was freely good. And such is the goodnesse communicated to them in their creation, not necessarie, but free: And if free, as well including a possibilitie of falling into evill, as an actuall state in goodnesse.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1251:32"/>
by restraint: hee had made him uncapable of that happinesse, whereto by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodnesse hee had ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him; for by this supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hee had not beene good in himselfe, nor could he be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of true felicitie, but he must bee capable likewise of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and miserie. The ground of his interest in the one, was his actuall and inherent good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse communicated in his creation: nor was hee liable to the other, but by the mutability of his goodnesse, or possibilitie of falling into evill. In like manner, hee that gave that knowne power and vertue to the load-stone, could as easily

draw the most stony hearted son of <hi>Adam</hi> unto Christ, as it doth steele and iron. But if hee should draw them by such a necessarie and naturall motion, hee should defeat them of all that hope or interest in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive glorie, which hee hath prepared for those that love him. If againe it bee demanded, why God doth not save he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent and stubborne sinner; it is all one, as if wee should aske, why hee doth not crowne bruit beasts with honour and immortality. That this he could doe by his infinite power, I will not deny. And if this he would doe, no creature justly might controll him, none possibly

But if
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1251:45"/>
wee admit the former extent of Gods unspeakable love to all, and his desire of their eternall safety, which desperately pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish; every man may, nay, must undoubtedly thus conclude; <hi>Therefore, Gods love extends to mee: It is his good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, to have mee saved amongst the rest, as well as any other: and whatsoever he unfainedly wils, his power is able effectually to bring to passe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The danger of sinne, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of that dreadfull day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first made knowne to our Auditory; the pressing of these points, as effectually as they might bee, (were this doctrine held for current) would kindle

the love of God in our hearts, and inflame them with desires answerable to Gods ardent will of our salvation: and these once kindled, would breed sure hope, and in a manner inforce us to embrace the infallible meanes thereunto ordained.</p>
                  <p>Without admission of the former doctrine, it is impossible for any man rightly to measure the hainousnesse of his owne or others sinnes. Such as gather the infinity of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

meanly affected by him, or in respect of which hee is little more than indif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>erent, may bee neglected without greater of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, than meaner persons may justly take for foule indignities or grievous wrongs. But if a Princes soveraigne command in a matter which he desired so much as his owne life, should be contemned; a loyall subject conscious of such contempt, though hapning through riot, or perswasions of ill company, would in his sober fits be ready to take revenge of himselfe; specially if hee knew his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes love or liking of him to be more than ordinary. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then, that as the Majesty
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1251:46"/>
and goodnesse of our God, so his love and mercy towards us is truly infinite: that he desires our repentance as earnestly, as wee can desire meat and drinke in the extremity of thirst or hunger; as wee can doe life it selfe, whiles wee are beset with death: This our <hi>God manifested in our flesh,</hi> did not desire his owne life so much as our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.

And though these were as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant to his humane nature, as to ours: yet were our sinnes to him more displeasant. As he was loving to us in his death:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1251:49"/>
so was hee wise towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and in submitting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe unto his cruell and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious death did of two evils chuse the lesse; rather to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the punishment due to our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>innes, than to suffer sinne still to raigne in us, whom he loved more dearely than his owne life. If then, we shall continue in sinne after the manifestation of his love: the hainousnesse of our offence is truly infinite: in so much as wee doe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, which is more distast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to our gracious God, than any torments can be to us.

For us then to ree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie the workes of Satan, or abett his faction, is still more offensive to this our God, then was his <hi>Agonie</hi> or bloudy sweat.</p>
                  <p>For taking a fuller measure of our sinnes: let us hereunto adde his patient expectation of his enemies conversion after the resurrection. If the sonne of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus</hi> before mentioned should have pardoned any as deeply
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1251:50"/>
guilty as himselfe had beene of that offence for which hee lost one of his eyes, and his father another; the world would have taxed him, either of unjust fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, or too much facilitie, rather than commended him for true justice or clemencie. But that we may know how farre Gods mercy doth over-beare his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie, he proceeds not straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to execute vengeance upon those Jewes which wrecked their malice upon his deare and onely Sonne, which had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted nothing worthy of blame, much lesse of death. Here was matter of wrath and indignation so just as would have moved the most mercifull
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1251:50"/>
man on Earth to have taken speedy revenge upon these spil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of innocent blood; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the law of God permitting thus much. But Gods mercy is above his law, above his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. These did exact the very abolition of these sinners in the very first act of sinne commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against God made man for their redemption: yet hee pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently expects their repentance which with unrelenting fury had plotted his destruction. <hi>Forty yeares long had hee beene grieved with this generation</hi> after the first Passeover celebrated in signe of their deliverance from <hi>AEgyptian</hi> bondage, and for their stubbornnesse <hi>Hee swore
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1251:51"/>
they should not enter into his rest.</hi> And now their posterity, after a more glorious deliverance from the powers of darknesse, have forty yeares allotted them for repentance, before they bee rooted out of the land of <hi>Rest</hi> or <hi>Promise. Yet hath not the Lord given them hearts to perceive, eyes to see, or eares to heare unto this day: because seeing they would not see, nor hearing would not heare</hi>; but hardened their hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Spirit of grace. Lord give us what thou didst not give them; hearts of flesh that may melt at thy threats; eares to heare the admonirions of our peace; and eyes to foresee the day of our visitation: that so
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1251:51"/>
when thy wrath shall be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led against sinne and sinners; wee may bee sheltered from flames of fire and brimstone, under the shadow of thy wings so long stretched out in mercie for us.

God sought to prepare them to glorie, yet had they a possibilitie or libertie utterly to spoile themselves in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.

                     <p>And here wee must request our Reader alwayes to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that the Apostle compares God, not to a frantick, or fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick potter, delighted to play tricks to his losse; as to make a vessell scarce worth a groat, of that peece, which with the same ease and cost, might bee made worth a shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;

                     <p>The summe then of our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles intended inference is this; As it is an unmannerly point for any man to contest, or wrangle with a skilfull arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer in his owne facultie, of whom hee should rather desire to learne with submission: so it

                  <p>Now when God had made <hi>Light,</hi> and had made it to these purposes, <hi>Hee saw that the light was good,</hi> sayes <hi>Moses.</hi> This <hi>See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> implyes a consideration, a deliberation, a debatement: That a religion, a forme of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing the <hi>Gospell,</hi> be not taken, or accepted blindly, nor impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly.

                  <p>

But God severed them otherwise than so too: hee severed them (as wee say in the Schooles) <hi>Non tanquam duo positiva,</hi> that <hi>Light</hi> should have a being here, and <hi>Darknesse</hi> a being there; but <hi>tanquam Positivum &amp; priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivum,</hi> that <hi>Light</hi> should have an essentiall being, and <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> utterly abolished.

this severing must hold in the <hi>Profession</hi> of <hi>the Gospell</hi> too; not so severed as here shall be a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and there a Masse: but that the true religion be really professed, and corrupt Religion be utterly abolished.
