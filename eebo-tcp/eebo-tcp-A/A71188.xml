            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Eere the Antient Cittie of <hi>Lyons</hi> towards the Weſt, lieth that part of the Country called <hi>Forreſts,</hi> which in it's little circumference com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends more varities then the reſt of <hi>France:</hi> for being divided into Plaines and Mountaines both of them are ſo fertile, and ſeated in ſuch a temperate Aire, that the ſoile is capable of whatſoever the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious Husbandman can expect or deſire. In the heart of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is a moſt Pleaſan, plaine circled about, as with a ſtrong wall, by its Neighbour hills, and watered with the River <hi>Loyre;</hi> which from its (not farre off) originall, glides gently through the midſt of it, without any ſwelling pride. Many other Rivulets doe in divers places beſtow their chryſtall ſtreams, the chiefe of which is <hi>Lignon,</hi> which, though extravagant in its courſe, as well as delectable in its Scource, runs <hi>Meander-like</hi> through the plaine, neere unto the loſty mountaines of <hi>Servieres</hi> and <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſel,</hi> unto <hi>Feures,</hi> where the <hi>Loyre</hi> receiving it, and ſwallowing up its name, carrieth it as tribute unto the Ocean.</p>
            <p>Upon the banks of theſe delighting Rivers, are continually to be ſeene abundance of ſhepheards, who though litle beholding to fortune, yet by reaſon of the aires naturall ſweetneſſe, and the Soiles fertilitie do live in abundance of contented happineſſe.</p>
            <p>They would never have envied the golden contentedneſſe of the firſt happy age, had Love let them alone to enjoy that felicitie of which the heavens were ſo prodigall unto them: but ſlumbering upon the downy beds of eaſe, they became ſubject unto Loves flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, who preſently turned his Authoritie into Tyranny. <hi>Celadon</hi> was one of them who did moſt feelingly reſent it, and who was ſo captivated with the perfections of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that the very <hi>odium</hi> of their Parents could not preſerve him from loſing himſelfe in her. The truth is, that if ever happineſſe could be found in the loſſe of ones ſelfe, it was by him, in loſing himſelfe to gaine the favour of the faire <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> who being aſſured of his affection, did ſcorne ingratitude, and received him and his ſervices with reciprocall affection: ſo that if any changing bee ſeene in either of them afterwards, 'tis probable that the heavens did allow it, to ſhew, that nothing is more conſtant then inconſtancie, which is conſtant in alteration. For theſe two having lived together moſt happily the ſpace of three yeares, even then when they leaſt feared any dyſaſterous accident, they found themſelves betrayed unto the worſt of loves misfortunes, by the perfidie of <hi>Semyres:</hi> ſo as <hi>Celadon</hi> to diſguiſe his affection from their Parents, who by reaſon of an inveterate hatred amongſt themſelves, did ſtrive to thwart their amorous deſignes, did ſeeme as if his addreſſes to that ſhepheardeſſe were rather out of civill courſe, then any courtſhip: This umbrage was handſome enough, if <hi>Semyres</hi> had not made it his ſtalking horſe to betray <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> which ſhe ſince repayed by many a ſigh and Teare.</p>

good morrow, and leaving his flocke to graze, he went to reſt himſelfe upon the banks of the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> there expecting the appearance of his faire ſhepheardeſſe, who was not long behind him: for ſhe out of too much fancy, had ſcarcely cloſed her eye that night. The Sunne no ſooner begun to gild the top of the mountains of <hi>I ſoures</hi> and <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

She followed her flock as if her ſhooes were Lead; and, as might be judged by the garbe, ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thing much troubled her mind, ſo as being neare her ſhepheard ſhe did not ſo much as tur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> &amp; ſhe ſat in ſo ſad a poſture that if <hi>Celadon</hi> had not beene more then halfe blind, he mightplainely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that this ſorrow could not proceed from any thing but an opinion of a change in his affection, for no other dyſaſter had power enough to cauſe ſuch ſad thoughts. But an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected misfortune being far more hard to reliſh then an other, it ſeemes fate had a minde to ſurpriſe him unawares.</p>
            <p>Thus being ignorant of his ill hap, after a choice of the fitteſt place for the grazing of his flock neare his deareſt ſheepherdeſs, he went to bid her good morrow, being extreamly joyed to ſee her: ſhe returned anſwer with looks and language ſo cold, as if a chill winter had frozen every ſyllable. The ſhepheard, unaccuſtomed to ſuch a ſight, was infinitly aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and though he could not imagine his dyſaſter ſo great as afterwards he found it, yet the very thought of offending her he loved, was enough to coſt him his life. Had the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſs deigned him a look, or had his zealous fancy permitted him to conſider what might be the cauſe of her coldneſs, certainly his apprehenſions had vaniſhed. But <hi>Celadon</hi> muſt not be the Phoenix of happineſs, as he was of Love; nor will fortune afford him more favour then other men, in matter of content. After a long and penſive extaſie, he rowſed up himſelfe, and turning towards his ſhepheardeſs, he perceived that ſhe looked upon him, but it was with ſo ſad an aſpect, that ſhe ſtruck him ſoulleſs. They were both ſo neer the River, that <hi>Celadon</hi> might eaſily reach it with the end of his ſheephooke; and ſome ſhowers had ſo ſwelled the water above its common marke that it diſgorged it ſelfe with a very impetuous ſtreame, into the River <hi>Loure.</hi> The place where they ſat was a hill, a litle raiſed above the common levell, againſt which the waves did beat in vaine, the foundation of it being a Rock covered over with ſome moſs. From this place, the ſhepheard did beat the waves of water with his ſheephook, and thoſe waves were not halfe ſo turbulent as his thoughts; he ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned up every action of his life, nay not a thought eſcaped inquiſition, and all to find out wherein he had offended: but his innocencie cleering up his conſcience, he was enboldned to aske her the reaſon of her anger. She not obſerving his actions, or elſe obſerving them to his diſadvantage, her heart begun to be the more inflamed with choler; ſo as when he offered to ſpeake, ſhe would not permit him to expreſſe himſelfe without interruption, ſaying: Is it not enough &amp; too much (perfidious and injurious ſhepheard) to have deluded her who leaſt deſerved it from you; but you muſt ſtill perſiſt in your wickedneſſe? how dare you be ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently bold, as to looke her in the face whom you have ſo groſly offended? Canſt thou without a bluſh bring that diſſembling face into my preſence? does not thy double ſoule tremble at its own villany, before me? Go go, and deceive ſome other; get thee gone traytor, and imploy thy perfidies in beguiling ſome that knowes them not; think not any longer to delude me, who am too too well accquainted with thy falſneſſe. At this the poore ſhepheard fals downe upon his knees; lookes pale and wanne, as if blaſted with a Thunderbolt. Is it your deſigne onely to try me, faire ſhepherdeſſe, (ſaid he unto her) or elſe to kill me with deſpaire? Nay, nay, falſe man, repli'd ſhe; I need not try thy infidelitie, for I am too well accquainted with it: Oh heavens, ſaid the ſhepherd. I wiſh this fatall day had never dawnd: It had beene happy for us both, replied ſhe, if neither of us had ever ſeen the light, then had thy infidelitie never troubled me. Go, go, perfidious wretch, I charge thee to be gone, and never againe looke me in the face, unleſſe I command it. <hi>Celadon</hi> would have replyed, had not his extafie of love bedeafed him: And as ſhe was going away, he was forced to pull her
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53526:4"/>
by the gowne, ſaying, I do not ſtay you deare ſhepherdeſſe, to begge a Pardon for my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne fault; but only to ſhew you that this is the laſt day of his life, whom you ſeeme ſo much to abhorre: but ſhe being all in a fury, and not ſo much as looking upon him did violently break away, and left behind her a Riband, upon which by accident his hand did lie; and alſo a Ring, which her Father had given her, was tyed in that Riband. The ſad ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard ſeeing her depart in ſuch a fury did ſtand awhile like a ſtock immovable; ſcarce know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he had in his hand, though his eye was upon it. At laſt recollecting himſelfe with a deer ſigh and taking notice of the Riband Witneſſe, deare Riband, ſaid he, that rather then untie the leaſt knot of my affection, I would loſe a hundred lives; when I am dead and my cruell faire one ſhall happily ſee thee on my arme, aſſure her that never any was more faithfull, then I; nor never any more cruell, then ſhe. Then tying it upon his arme, and kiſſing the Ring And thou, right emblem of true affection, ſaid he, let me enjoy thee to the laſt, as a pledge of her promiſed affection to me. He had no ſooner uttered theſe words, but tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his eyes toward <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> he leaped into the River with croſſed arms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lignon</hi> in that place was very deep and violent, &amp; by reaſon of the Rocke which repulſed the water, there was a kind of whirlpit: ſo as the ſhepheard was long before he ſunk to the bottom, and longer in comming up to the top againe. And when he did appeare, nothing could be ſeen, but firſt a leg, and then an arm: at laſt being gulfed up by the turning of the waves, he was carried away under the water. Now <hi>Aſtrea</hi> runs to the Water ſide, and ſeeing him whom ſhe could not chuſe but love by her meanes ſo neer his death; ſhe was ſo affrighted, that in lieu of lending any help, ſhe falls into a ſwound and that ſo neer the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that when ſhe returned to her ſelfe, at the firſt motion ſhe fell in, and was in ſo much danger, as all that ſome ſhepheards cloſe by could do was litle enough to ſave her by pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her out by her garments; which kept her above the water, and gave them time to draw her unto the ſide: but life was ſo farre ſpent, as ſhe perceived it not. They carried her unto the next ſhepherds cabbin, whereby accident <hi>Phillis</hi> was, and where they ſhifted her cloaths: ſhe all this while was ſo aſtoniſhed both at her owne accident and at that of <hi>Celadons,</hi> that ſhe could not ſpeake. Mean while, <hi>Celadon</hi> was hurried by the fury of the waves a farre off on the other ſide of the River, amongſt ſome little trees; but with very little ſigne of life.</p>
            <p>As ſoone as <hi>Phillis</hi> heard of this accident unto <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſhe made all haſte poſſible and had not <hi>Lycidas</hi> met her, nothing elſe could have ſtopped her, yet ſhe told him briefly, the danger in which <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was; not mentioning a word concerning <hi>Celadon,</hi> for ſhe knew not any thing of his diſaſter: this <hi>Lycidas</hi> was <hi>Celadons</hi> brother, and theſe two were tyed faſter together in amity then conſanguinitie: on the other ſide, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> being Couſens, did love each other ſo well, as they deſerved to be compared with the two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: As <hi>Celadon</hi> had a Sympatheticall affection unto <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> ſo <hi>Lycidas</hi> had as ſtrong an inclination to ſerve <hi>Phillis,</hi> as <hi>Phillis</hi> had to favour <hi>Lycidas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So it chanced, that as they came into the cottage, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> opened her eyes, but you may imagine that they had loſt much of their wonted luſtre, and looked heavy and dull, and their ſprightlineſs drowned in tears yet ſuch tears, as, flowing from an enflamed heart and lovely eyes moved abundance of love and pitty from all her beholders. When ſhe eſpied her companion <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſhe was much moved; but much more when ſhe ſaw <hi>Lycidas</hi> and though ſhe was loath to let the people about her know the cauſe of her diſaſter; yet ſhe was forced to ſay, hat his brother was drowned in helping her. <hi>Lycidas</hi> was ſo aſtoniſhed at the newes, that he ran immediatly to the fatall place with all the reſt of the ſhepheards, leaving <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> alone, who preſently after, began to follow them, but ſo ſad a pace, that though they had much to ſay, yet they could not ſpeake one ſyllable. Meane time the ſhepheards came to the River ſide, and looking on every ſide they could not finde the leaſt ſigne of what they ſought; for only thoſe, who went the loweſt downe the River, chanced to find his hat, which the waves had caſt up upon ſome willows and reeds which grew by the water ſide: this was all the newes they could heare: As for <hi>Celadon,</hi> he was carried by the water much lower and into a place where it was unpoſſible for them to find him. for as I told you before, the waves had wafted him over to the other ſide, and he ſtucke upon a thick ruſh of trees, where it was very hard to ſee him.</p>
            <p>When he was even betwixt life and death, there came to the place, three fair Nymphs, with diſheavelled haire waving and hanging upon their ſhoulders, under a garland of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Pearles; their breſts were naked their ſleeves turned up to the elbow, and their arms bare, onely covered with pureſt Lawne to the Wreſts, on which they wore
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53526:5"/>
rich bracelets of Orientall Pearls: each of them wore a quiver full of arrows, and in their hands they carried bowes of Ivorie: their petticotes were tucked up ſo high as permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their golden buskins to be ſeene, as high as the knee. It ſeems they came unto that place upon ſome deſigne: for (ſaid one of them) this is the very place, ſearch well the ſide of the River; See, ſee! how impetuouſly it ſwells it ſelf above its common levell: obſerv that Tuft of trees, doubtleſſe it is the very ſame which was repreſented to us in the mirror. 'Tis true, (ſaid the chiefe of them,) but all the reſt is nothing reſemblant: but me thinkes I ſee another odd place, more likely to find that which we looke for: its very probable (ſaid the third, who had not yet ſpoke) for the place is ſo exactly deſcribed, as I beleeve there is not one tree, but you ſaw in the mirrour. In ſuch diſcourſe as this, they came ſo neere the place where <hi>Celadon</hi> was, that nothing but a few leaves did interpoſe betweene him and their ſight. They having exactly ſurvayed every thing, they concluded it to be the place which was ſhewed unto them, and therefore reſolved to ſit downe. The principall of theſe Nymphs as ſhe was ſitting downe, eſpyed <hi>Celadon:</hi> and ſuppoſing him to be ſome ſhepheard aſleepe and beckning with one hand unto her companions, ſhe pointed to the place with the other; and treading very gently for feare of waking him ſhe ſtepped forward; but being neerer, ſhe beleeved him to be dead. For his feet did lie in the water, his right arme upon his head, and the left carleſly hanging behind him; his neck awry as if his head were too heavy; his mouth halfe open, and almoſt full of ſand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his face pale and dirtie, his eyes almoſt cloſed: and his haire which he wore very long, ſo wet, that the water ran like a ſtream from it his countenance was the very picture of death; his backe ſo bended, that it ſeemed broke: and that made his belly ſeeme the more ſwelled. The Nymphs, ſeeing him in this deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, were mooved with much pitty; and <hi>Leonida,</hi> as moſt officious and pittifull, was the firſt which laid hand upon him to draw him out of the river. The water, which he had ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed came from him in ſuch abundance, that the Nimph finding ſome warmth yet in him, did beleeve him to be recoverable. Then <hi>Galathia,</hi> who was the chiefe of them, turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the other Nymph, who looked on but did not help; Come <hi>Sylvia,</hi> (ſaid ſhe unto her) why are you ſo idle? come and help, if not to eaſe your companions, yet out of pittie to this poore ſhepheard. I am conſidering, Madam, (ſaid ſhe) that though he be very much changed, yet me thinkes I ſhould know him. Then taking him by the other arme, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him more preciſely, Certainly (ſaid ſhe) I am not miſtaken: Tis he I meane; and beleeve it, he merits all our helps: for he is not only of the firſt family in all the country, but his merits are ſo many, as our beſt indeavours to ſave him will be well imployed: All this while, the water came from him in ſuch abundance, that the ſhepheard being more empty, began to breathe: but did not yet open his eyes nor come unto himſelf. <hi>Galathia</hi> having an opinion that he was the man, of whom the Druid had ſpoken unto her, ſhe her ſelfe did help her companions: and commanded them to carry him unto her Pallace of <hi>Iſoures,</hi> where he might have the beſt accommodations of help. And accordingly with much adoe, they carryed him to the place, where the litle Merill wood with their chariot, into which they all did get. <hi>Leonida</hi> undertooke to be their guide; and, becauſe they ſhould not be ſeene by the guards of the Caſtle, they went in at a backe ſecret dore. As ſoone as they were gone, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> reviving from her ſwounding fit, did fall into the water, as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: <hi>Lycidas</hi> and they who went to ſearch for <hi>Celadon,</hi> could heare no other tidings of him, then, as formerly I told you: ſo as <hi>Lycidas,</hi> being but too well aſſured of his brothers death, he went to <hi>Aſtrea</hi> to condole with her their common diſaſter. She, ſad ſoul, did nothing elſe but walk mourning along the River ſide, untill ſhe was ſo weary that ſhe was forced to ſit downe as full of anger griefe and amazement, as a little before, ſhe was of inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and jealouſie. She was ſitting a lone by herſelfe; for, <hi>Phillis</hi> ſeeing <hi>Lycidas</hi> returne, went out to heare ſome newes, as the reſt did. This Shepheard when he came, being weary and deſirous to know how this misfortune came to paſſe, he did ſit downe by her; and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her by the hand began to talke; Oh heavens, fair ſhepherdeſſe, (ſaid he) what a fatall miſchance is this, which hath happned unto us; I ſay, us, for as I have loſt a deare brother ſo you have loſt one who was not himſelfe without you. Whether <hi>Aſtreas</hi> mind was intent upon ſome other thing, or whether this diſcourſe was diſpleaſant unto her, I know not, but ſhe returned no anſwer; At which <hi>Lycidas</hi> being angry thus ſaid; Is it poſſible <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that the loſſe of this unfortunate Son (for ſo <hi>Aſtrea</hi> called him) ſhould ſo little perplex you, that you cannot afford him one teare? Had he not loved you; or had you been ignorant of his affection, then to reſent his misfortune ſo ſlightly, had been excuſable: but ſince he loved you infinitly above himſelfe and that you could not be ignorant of it; beleeve me, <hi>Aſtrea,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:53526:5"/>
it grieves me to ſee you, as little concerned at it as if he were a meere ſtranger unto you.</p>
            <p>The ſhepherdeſs then looked ſadly towards him, and after a little pauſe of conſideration, anſwered. Shephered, I am much grieved at the death of your brother, not in conſideration of any affection which he bore unto me, but in reſpect of his many other excellent qualities, which might well move any to grieve at his misfortune: for, as for the affection which you ſpoke of, it was ſo common unto other ſhepheardeſſes my companions, as it was their parts to lament him more then mine. Oh moſt ungratefull ſhepherdeſſe, cryed out <hi>Lycidas,</hi> I ſhall thinke the gods unjuſt, if they do not puniſh you for your injuſtice: you have ſmall reaſon to thinke him unconſtant, who, for all the anger of his Parents and cruelty of your rigour, would not diminiſh the leaſt ſparke of his affection to you. This is ingratitude in the height, ſince all his actions and ſervices could not aſſure you of the thing, which none living ever doubted of, but your ſelfe: This am I certaine of, that he would ſooner have diſobeyed the Supreame gods, then the leaſt of your commands. Then did the ſhepheardeſſe in an angry manner anſwer, that this diſcourſe was diſadvantagious to his Brother; for ſhe had ſufficient teſtimonies of his infidelitie. You fill me full of wonder (replied <hi>Lycidas,)</hi> but I beſeech you how came you to the knowledge of it? Shepherd, (anſwered <hi>Aſtrea)</hi> the ſtory is too long and lamentable to be told: ſatisfie your ſelfe with this that if you do not know it you are the only one that is ignorant of it: for there is not a ſhepherd about the banks of <hi>Lignon</hi> which cannot tell you, that <hi>Celadon</hi> had a hundred Miſtriſſes. And, to be ſhort, theſe eares of mine were no longer then yeſterday witneſſes of the amorous diſcourſe which he held with his <hi>Aminthé</hi> (for ſo he called her) and I had hearkned longer unto it, had I not beene diſpleaſed at his perfidie, or, to tell you truly, had I not other buſineſſe which was more advantagious unto me. <hi>Lycidas</hi> at this, like a man diſtracted, cryed out: oh now, I ſee the cauſe of my brothers death; it was your jealouſie, <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> your jealouſy is the onely cauſe of this dire diſaſter. Poore <hi>Celadon!</hi> I now remember thy Prophetique words, when thou ſaideſt, thy fain'd affection would coſt thee thy life. Then addreſſing himſelfe unto her, Is it poſſible <hi>Aſtrea</hi> (ſaid he) that you ſhould forget thoſe commands, which you ſo often and preſſingly, did lay upon him? five or ſix times at the leaſt, I can witneſſe he was down upon his knees, begging a revocation of them: You may remember when he returned from <hi>Italie</hi> it was your firſt injunction to diſſemble love unto another, which he intreated you rather to bid him die then do. My deare <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſaid he, (I ſhall never forget his words) though I muſt &amp; will be perfectly obedient unto all your commands, yet I cannot chuſe but throw my ſelfe at your feet, imploring onely ſo much favour as to bid me Die, rather then bid me ſerve any other then <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> And you did anſwer, Nay, Shepheard, far be it from my thoughts to command you to Die; but it is to try your affection, and principally to blind the eyes and ſtop the mouths of all inquiſitive ſpies, that I do enjoyn this diſſimulation upon you. He, not being able to diſobey you in any thing, undertooke the difficulty; and indeed difficulty I rightly phraſe it. For he never went unto the place, where hee was to put his diſſimulation into practice, but he firſt laid himſelfe downe upon his bed, as if a trembling fit of a feaver came upon him. Not above two dayes ſince, I found him engraving upon a tree, theſe enſuing verſes, whoſe characters, if you have not quite forgotten both him and his ſervices, you will know, if you pleaſe to turne your eyes towards yonder tree on the other ſide of the River, which containes theſe lines:</p>
            <lg>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But then to play the Hypocrite</l>

            <p>It was long before <hi>Aſtrea</hi> anſwered a word; for the diſcourſe of <hi>Lycidas</hi> had almoſt aſtoniſhed her: but the ſparks of jealouſie which yet had ſome power in her ſoul, cauſed her to take the letter, as doubting whether or no it was <hi>Celadon</hi> which writ it And though ſhe knew it well enough to be his hand, yet according to the humor of many who will often argue againſt their owne opinions, ſhe diſputed it. At the ſame time, many ſhepheards came from the queſt of <hi>Celadon,</hi> but had found no other ſignes of him, then that of his Hat, which was no ſmall grief unto <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> She remembring a privat retyring place which love helped them to find out, and which ſhe would not have found out, did becken unto <hi>Phillis</hi> to take that away: but every one, began to lament, and extoll the poore ſhepherd, and not one but had ſome Noble act or other to Trumpet, in his praiſe. But <hi>Aſtrea</hi> who was the moſt ſenſible was the leaſt talkative: ſhe was conſtrained to be mute, and to ſhew her ſorrow the leaſt, knowing that it is the higheſt point of prudence, in love to conceale affection, or at leaſt never to let it appeare unprofitably: but becauſe the conſtraint ſhe was in, was great, and ſhe not able to endure it, ſhe came to <hi>Phillis</hi> and entreated her not to follow her, to the end others might do the like. So taking <hi>Celadons</hi> hat into her hand, ſhe ſtole away alone, and followed the firſt path ſhe lightt upon. Every ſhepherd in the company knew of <hi>Celadons</hi> affection to <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> though the perverſneſſe of their Parents did diſcover it more then his actions: but ſhe did carry the matter with ſo much diſcretion, that none knew of hers to him, except <hi>Semira, Lycidas</hi> and <hi>Phillis:</hi> And though they knew very well that the loſſe of <hi>Celadon</hi> did much perplex her, yet they did attribute it more unto the goodneſſe of her nature then her love. However, ſhe continued on her way; and every ſtep had its thought or rather griefe: ſo as, ſometimes doubtfull, ſometimes aſſured of <hi>Celadons</hi> affection, ſhe knew not whether ſhe ſhould lay the blame upon him or herſelfe when ſhe thought upon what <hi>Lycidas</hi> had ſaid ſhe judged him innocent: when the diſcourſe he had with the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe <hi>Aminthé,</hi> came into her memorie, ſhe thought him culpable. In this labirinth of thoughts, ſhe went wandring through a wood, without any election of path: but either by fortune, or by the direction of heaven, to manifeſt the innocence of <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſhe came to the place where <hi>Lycidas</hi> ſaid he had engraved ſome verſes, upon a tree: which was ſo freſh that ſhee quickly found them out. Oh heavens, how ſoone ſhe knew them to be <hi>Celadons,</hi> and how readily ſhe ran to read them! She ſat downe upon the ground, and beholding <hi>Celadons</hi> hat and letter in her lappe, ſhe wrong her hands and looked fixedly upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of her deare ſhepherd: and ſeeing his hat to ſwell a little in the place, where he was wont to put his letters, when he had a deſigne to convey a letter unto her, ſhe unripped the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with her fingers, and pulled out a paper which <hi>Celadon</hi> the ſame day, had put there: this was a device contrived betwixt them, when their parents had forbidden them any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe of language: for, he ſeeming to throw his hat in jeaſt unto her, they might eaſily convey letters unto each other. With a trembling heart and hand, ſhe tooke this letter out, and after ſhe had remooved from her eyes a thouſand pearly teares, ſhe read theſe words.</p>

            <p>Oh how theſe words did wound her ſoul, when ſhe called to memorie, the command ſhe had laid upon him, and the reſolution which they fixed upon, to diſſemble their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But ſee the ſtrange enchantments of love; for though ſhee grieved extremely at the death of <hi>Celadon;</hi> yet ſhe was not without ſome conſolation in the midſt of her ſorrowes, to think that he was not perfidious, though this conſideration brought much force with it to torment her: ſo as having no other remedie to fly unto but teares, as well to lament <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> as her owne loſſe, ſhe began with a river of teares, and afterwards with a thouſand pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull groanes, and ſad ſighes: She called to mind the faithfull affection of that ſhepheard, and the deſpaire wherein he was at her ſevere anſwer: then againe, thinking upon the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py times paſt, the pleaſures and contentments which he formerly afforded her, and now the loſſe both of him and them, ſhe extreamly condemned her ſelfe of ſilly imprudence.</p>
            <p>On the otherſide, <hi>Lycidas</hi> being ſo extreamly diſpleaſed at <hi>Aſtrea</hi> that he could hardly with patience thinke upon her, he did riſe up from <hi>Phillis,</hi> and went away with eyes ſo full of teares and ſo ſad a countenance, that his ſhepherdeſſe ſeeing him in that condition, did follow him, not fearing how others might cenſure her for it: he went away with folded armes, his hat pulled downe but his ſoul much more downe in ſorrow: and pittie obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the reſt of the ſhepheards to participate of his ſorrowes, they followed alſo and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him. But theſe officious complements were only additions to his griefe: for in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, the ſoule dares not ſo freely disburthen it ſelfe of its load; but when it is once diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of its venime, then it is capable of conſolation. Being in this ſad eſtate, they acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally found a young ſhepherd lying upon the graffe and two ſhepherdeſſes with him: the one of them holding his head in her lappe, and the other playing upon a L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Lycidas</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> had a good mind to enquire the cauſe of this ſhepherds griefe, if their owne would have permitted them but finding him to ſtand as much in need of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation as themſelves, they would not add the miſeries of another unto their owne. And therefore leaving the reſt of the ſhepherds to hearken further, they went on their way and none followed them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lycidas</hi> was no ſooner gon but they heard another voice a far off, which ſeemed to draw neere them: and ſetting themſelves to hearken, they were interrupted by that ſhepherdeſſe who held the head of a ſhepherd in her lappe, and uttered theſe complaints; Fie, fie, thou obdurate peece of cruelty, thou pittileſſe ſhepheard; how long will thy heart be marble, and eares ſtopped to my prayers? Why ſhould one who is not, be preferred before one that is vowed thine? <hi>Tircis, Tircis,</hi> thou Idolizer of the dead, and enemy of the living; looke upon my poore affection; Love thoſe that are alive, and let the dead reſt quiet; trouble not their happie aſhes with thy unprofitable teares; take heed, thou doſt not draw vengance upon thy ſelfe, for thy cruelty and injuſtice. The ſhepherd, not ſo much as turning towards her, coldly anſwered; I wiſh, faire ſhepherdeſſe, that I could give you ſatisfaction by my death: I would willingly die to rid both you and my ſelfe from our torments: conſider I beſeech you <hi>Laonice,</hi> that you have no reaſon to urge me to put my deare <hi>Cleon</hi> twice to death; Its enough, ſhe has once paid the debt due to Nature. If now ſhe is dead, ſhe ſhould once againe revive in me, by force of my affection: would you have me remove her, by enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a new love into my ſoul? No, no, ſhepherdeſſe, all your arguments are too weake to make me hearken unto any ſuch counſell: that which you call cruelty in me, I tearm fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie; and that which you thinke worthy of puniſhment, I conceive deſerves exceeding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations: I have already told you, that the ſacred memory of my <hi>Cleon</hi> ſhall live with me in my grave. I have vowed it a thouſand times both unto her and the immortall gods with whom ſhe is; and do you not thinke that they would puniſh <hi>Tircis,</hi> if he ſhould breake all thoſe ſolemne vowes, and become unfaithfull? Yes yes: the heavens ſhall ſooner raine Thunderbolts upon my head, then I will either offend againſt my vowes, or my deare <hi>Cleon.</hi> She would have replyed, when the ſhepheard, which they heard ſinging came neere and interrupted her with theſe verſes.</p>

            <p>At this laſt verſe, this Shepherd was ſo neare <hi>Tircis,</hi> that he perceived the teares of <hi>Laonice:</hi> and, though ſtrangers, yet having a ſuperficiall acquaintance, <hi>Hilas</hi> knowing how it was betweene <hi>Laonice</hi> and <hi>Tircis,</hi> he addreſſed himſelfe thus unto him Diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſhepheard (for ſo every one did call him by reaſon of his ſadneſſe) If I were like unto you. I ſhould thinke my ſelfe the moſt pittifull peece of misfortune that lives upon earth. <hi>Tircis</hi> hearing this, thus anſwered. And I <hi>Hylas,</hi> were I like unto you, I ſhould think my ſelfe more unfortunate then I am. Should I like you, (replied <hi>Hylas)</hi> drop teares for every Miſtriſſe that I have Loſt, I ſhould teare out my eyes before I had done. Were you like unto me, (anſwered <hi>Tircis</hi> you would have but one to drop any teares for. And were you like unto me (ſaid <hi>Hilas)</hi> you would not drop a teare for any. Thats the reaſon (replyed the ſad ſhepheard) I do think you miſerable; for if love be the only price and reward of Love never any did love you, becauſe you never loved any. How do you know (anſwered <hi>Hilas)</hi> that I never loved any? I know it, ſaid <hi>Tircis,</hi> by your perpetuall changing You and I do differ in opinions (ſaid he) for I ever thought that the more a workman is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in his trade, the more perfect he is in it. Tis true, anſwered <hi>Tircis,</hi> when he workes by the rules of Art: but if otherwiſe, he is like unto travellers out of their way, the more they goe, the more they erre, and further from the right way. And as the rowling ſtone never ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers any moſſe, but rather dirt; ſo your leight inconſtancy may get ſome ſhame, but never any Love. You muſt know, <hi>Hilas,</hi> that the wounds of Love are ſuch as will never heale. Heavens deliver me from any ſuch (ſaid <hi>Hilas).</hi> You have good reaſon for your prayer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Tircis,</hi> For if every time you were wounded with a new beautie, you ſhould receive an incurable wound, I am afraid there would not be one ſound part in all your body. Moreover you never can reliſh any of thoſe ſweets and felicities which Love beſtowes upon all true Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and that miraculouſly, like the reſt of his actions: for they are cured by the ſame, which wounds, like the ſword of <hi>Telephus</hi> which both cuts and heales: and I am perſwaded that were you once permitted to know the ſecrets of that god, you would preſently renounce your inconſtancy. <hi>Hilas</hi> at this ſmiled and ſaid. There is very great reaſon, <hi>Tircis,</hi> that you ſhould put your ſelfe in the number of thoſe whom Love uſeth very well but as for my part, I do with all my heart quit my ſhare in all his ſweets: you may keep to your ſelfe all his felicities and contentments without any feare that ever I ſhall envie you. 'Tis now a whole month ſince firſt we met, and I think we met every day; I do not remember that day, that hour, nay nor that minute in which you were not entertaining your Love forſooth, with that good company of teares: on the contrary, tell me that day, that hour, or that minute in which you hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

up and live Will you by your patience make your ſelfe a complice with him in his crimes? do you not ſee, that he glories in your teares? know you not, that your ſupplications doe puff him up with ſo much arrogancy, as he thinkes you to be highly obliged unto him if he does hearken unto you with diſdaine? The Shepheardeſſe with a deepe ſigh anſwered, It is an eaſie matter, <hi>Hylas,</hi> for him that is ſound to counſell the ſick: but if you were in my ſtead, you would know that all this advice is in vaine: you might find that ſorrow would ſooner drive my ſoule out of my body, then reaſon can drive this paſſion out of my ſoul. For this my beloved Shepheard has ſuch a Soveraigne power over me, that his authoritie can command what he pleaſeth: ſpare then all your ſapient adviſements <hi>Hylas:</hi> they will but feſter my wounds the more; for I am ſo wholly devoted unto <hi>Tircis,</hi> that my will is not my owne How! (ſaid the Shepheard) your will not your owne? to what purpoſe is it then to Love and ſerve you? The ſame (anſwered the Shepheardeſſe) that my Love and ſervices are unto this Shepheard. That is as much to ſay (anſwered <hi>Hilas)</hi> that I ſhould loſe both all my time and my paines, and that if I ſhould profeſſe my affection unto you, you would only make uſe of my words to expreſſe your affection unto <hi>Tircis</hi> but ſince ſuch is your humour, and ſince I have more command over my ſelfe then you over yours, I will only kiſſe your hand and take my leave: for I ſhall be aſhamed to ſerve ſuch a poore and pittifull Miſtriſſe. Neither you nor I (anſwered ſhe) ſhall receive any great loſſe by it. Were you as ſenſible of your loſſe in loſing me, ſaid <hi>Hilas,</hi> as you ſhew ſimplicitie in courting him, you would lament the loſſe of me, ſooner then deſire the affection of <hi>Tircis:</hi> but if you care no more for loſing me, then I do for loſing you, ile warrant you, neither of our ſorrowes ſhall ever hurt us.

            <p>Had this Shepheard come into the country in a more merry ſeaſon, doubtleſſe with more friends: but <hi>Celadons</hi> loſſe did ſit ſo ſadly upon the ſoules of all that neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, that none was in any mood of rallarie; and therefore they left him: ſome returned to their cabins &amp; others in farther queſt of <hi>Celadon;</hi> ſome on this ſide, &amp; ſome beyond the River <hi>Loire;</hi> neither tuft nor tree eſcaped their inquiſitive ſearch, yet all in vaine: for no newes could be heard of him. Only <hi>Silvander</hi> did meet <hi>Polemas</hi> juſt at the place, where <hi>Galathea</hi> and the other Nymphes had a little before taken him up. And becauſe he Governed the country under the Authoritie of the Nymph <hi>Amaſis</hi> the Shepheard, who had often ſeene him at <hi>Marcelles,</hi> did render him all poſſible honour; and acquainted him with the loſſe of <hi>Celadon;</hi> at which <hi>Polemas</hi> was very ſorry, being ever a Lover of all <hi>Celadons</hi> familie.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide <hi>Lycidas,</hi> who was walking with <hi>Phillis,</hi> after a long ſilence, at laſt he turned towards her; well, faire Shepheardeſſe (ſaid he unto her) what do you thinke of your companion? ſhe not yet knowing of <hi>Aſtreas</hi> Jealouſie, did anſwere him, that ſhe could not be much blamed, if ſhe upon ſuch a ſad accident did ſhun all company; for <hi>Phillis</hi> thought that he complayned becauſe ſhe went away alone: Nay, nay, replyed <hi>Lycidas,</hi> that's nothing; but I doe thinke her to be the moſt ungratefull woman in the world, and the leaſt worthy of any Love: for my brother never intended, nor could he Love any but only ſhe: ſhe knew it well enough, cruell woman that ſhe was: the teſtimonies he gave her, were too evident to be doubted: he overcame all difficulties, he ſtopt not at impoſſibilities: he valued not the anger of Parents, but endured her rigours, her cruelties, and ſcorns, and all this ſo long, that I beleeve no other but <hi>Celadon</hi> was able to do it. And yet for all this, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> did moſt unworthilie change her mind: her fooliſh pretences of hatred and jealouſy has
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53526:8"/>
eternally exiled him: and being grown deſperate, he did chuſe death rather then ſuch a piece of crueltie as ſhe. Oh Heavens! <hi>Lycidas,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi> in a great amazement) whats this you ſay? Is it poſſible, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſhould ever commit ſuch a crime? It is moſt certainly true (anſwered the Shepheard) ſhe has partly told me as much, and I do conjecture the reſt by his diſcourſe. She tryumphs in the death of my brother, and her infidelitie and ingratitude can palliate her crime: but I do ſweare unto you by all that's ſacred, never any Lover was fuller of affection and fidelitie then he: I care not whether or no ſhe ever know her error, unleſſe to vexe and grieve her; for now I am as profeſſed an enemy unto her, as ever my brother was faithfull. Thus <hi>Lycidas</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> diſcourſed, he being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely grieved for the death of his brother, and as much offended againſt <hi>Aſtrea:</hi> and ſhe, very ſorry for <hi>Celadons</hi> death, angred at the anger of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and aſtoniſhed at the Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of her companion would not apply any extreame remedies, at the firſt; but only ſome gentle preparatives to mollifie him. She would not by any meanes that the death of <hi>Celadon</hi> ſhould coſt her <hi>Lycidas:</hi> and ſhe conſidered that if any hatred was betweene him and <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> ſhe muſt of neceſſitie breake off with one of the two; yet Love would not yeeld unto friendſhip. On the other ſide, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was ſo ſwelled in teares and ſuncke in ſorrow: as having not teares enough to waſh away her error, nor words enough to expreſſe her griefe, both her eyes and mouth did leave their offices unto her imaginations ſo long as both eyes, toung, imagination, and all other faculties being tyred out, ſhe fell aſleepe.</p>
            <p>Whilſt things paſſed thus amongſt the Shepheards and Shepheardeſſes, <hi>Celadon</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the three Nymphes in the Pallace of <hi>Iſoures</hi> with all indulgent care: but the hurt which the water had done him was ſo great, that for all their remedies which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, he could not open his eyes nor give any ſigne of life, but only by the beating of his heart, paſſing all the day and a good part of the night, before he came to himſelfe; And when he opened his eyes, he was in a great amazement to find himſelfe in that place: for he very well remembred what he had done and how a raſh deſpair had made him throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into the water: but he knew not how he came thither. And after he had ſtayed a long while in this confuſed thought, he asked whether he was alive or dead. If I be alive (ſaid he) how is it poſſible that the cruelty of <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſhould not kill me? And if I be dead, why, cruell Love, doſt thou torment me in the ſhades of death? is it not enough that thou haſt my life, but thou muſt receive my old flames out of my dead aſhes? And the great perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in which <hi>Aſtrea</hi> had left him having now forſaken him, he called into his memory all his former conceptions, and his mind being full of imagination both of his miſeries and alſo of his former happineſſe, he fell into ſuch a ſound ſleepe, that the Nymphes had time enough to come and ſee him, and finding him faſt aſleepe, they opened the curtaines and windowes very gently, and did ſit downe by him, the better to view and contemplate upon him. <hi>Galathea,</hi> after a whiles confideration, did in a low voice for feare of wakeing him, ſay, oh how this Shepheard is changed ſince yeſterday? What a freſh complexion is upon a ſuddaine come into his face? ſeriouſly I do not repent of all the paines I have taken in ſaving his life; for as you ſaid, ſweetheart (ſaid ſhee, and turned towards <hi>Silvia)</hi> he is one of the principall in al the country: Madam, (anſwered the Nymph) moſt certainly he is; for <hi>Alſippes</hi> is his Father, and <hi>Amarillis</hi> his Mother. How? ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> that <hi>Alſippe</hi> ſo famous, who to ſave his freind, did break open the Priſon of the Viſigotts at <hi>Uſſum?</hi> The very ſame, (ſaid <hi>Silvia)</hi> I have ſeene him ſeverall times at feaſts, which are kept by the Townes about <hi>Lignon.</hi> And becauſe <hi>Alſippes</hi> ſeemed unto me moſt worthy of obſervation, I looked long upon him: for the formalitie of his beard, and the gravitie of his venerable age, did exact honour and obſervance from every one.</p>
            <p>But as for <hi>Celadon</hi> I remember, that of all the Shepheards, there was only he and <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> who had confidence enough to approach me; by <hi>Silvander</hi> I knew which was <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and by <hi>Celadon</hi> which <hi>Silvander:</hi> for both of them, had in their Garbes and diſcourſe ſomthing more generous, then the name of Shepheard uſeth to owne. Whilſt <hi>Silvia</hi> ſpake, Love, in mock age of the ſubtiltie of <hi>Climante</hi> and <hi>Polemas,</hi> who were the cauſe of <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theas</hi> coming to the place where ſhe tooke up <hi>Celadon,</hi> did begin to kindle new flames in this Nymph; for all the while that <hi>Silvia</hi> ſpoke, ſhe had her eyes upon the Shepheard; and the applauds which ſhe gave him, did enter into her ſoul; and the more eaſilie, becauſe ſhe was prepared for it by the coming of <hi>Climante,</hi> who counterfetting himſelfe to be a <hi>Druide,</hi> had foretold her, that the man whom ſhe ſhould meet with, in the place where ſhe found <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſhould be her husband, unleſſe ſhe would be the moſt miſerable woman in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53526:9"/>
world; the plot being, that <hi>Polemas</hi> ſhould go to that place at the hour, to the end that ſhe might more willingly be induced to marry him, which otherwiſe, the affection ſhe bore unto <hi>Lindamor</hi> would not permit. But Fortune and Love, are too hard for Prudence; and ſent <hi>Celadon</hi> thither by chance, as I have told you: ſo as <hi>Galathea,</hi> intending to fixe Love upon this Shepheard, did thinke him to be extreame Lovely: And ſeeing he did not wake, ſhe went out as gently as ſhe could, to entertaine her new thoughts.</p>
            <p>There was neere his chamber a backe paire of ſtaires, which opened to a low Gallerie, out of which, by a draw bridge one might go into a Garden full of choice varieties, Fountaines, Statues Walkes, Arbors and all that Art could invent; out of this Garden was a dore into a Wilderneſſe of ſeverall ſorts of Trees: in which was ſeverall Labirinthes, wherein one might wander to the loſſe of ones ſelfe, yet by reaſon of the umbrage were very delightfull: In one of which was a Fountaine called The truth of Love, a place in truth marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly pleaſing: for by force of Inchantment, a Lover who looked in it might ſee her, he loved: if he were Loved, he might ſee his Miſtriſſe by him if ſhe Loved another, that other would be preſented and not himſelfe: And becauſe it did diſcover all the deceipts of Lovers, it was called the Truth of Love. In another, Labirinth was the Cavern of <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Fortune;</hi> and in another was the denn of an old Mandrake, full of ſo many wonders and witchcrafts, that every vanitie appeared a freſh miracle. Moreover, in the other parts of the wood, there was ſeverall other Grotts, ſo well counterfeited, and neere the naturall, as the eye did oft deceive the judgment. It was in this Garden, where the Nymph did walke wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the waking of the Shepheard: And becauſe her new deſires would not permit her to be ſilent, ſhe faigned to forget ſomthing which ſhe commanded <hi>Silvia</hi> to go and ſeeke: for ſhe confided leſſe in her green youth, then in <hi>Leonidas</hi> whoſe age was arrived at more matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, though both theſe Nymphes were her ſecret confidents. And being alone with <hi>Leoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> ſhe thus ſaid unto her; what do thinke, <hi>Leonida,</hi> has not this <hi>Druide</hi> a ſtrange know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things? Does not the gods freely communicate themſelves unto him? for what is future, he knowes as well as the preſent: The truth is, anſwered the Nymph, he did very directly ſhew you in the Mirror, the very place where you found this Shepheard, and alſo told you the very time; but his words were ſo ambiguous, that I beleeve he hardly underſtood them himſelfe. Why do you ſay ſo, anſwered <hi>Galathea,</hi> ſince he hath particularly told me every thing as perfectly as I my ſelfe do not now kow them, better than he did before they happened? he only told you, anſwered <hi>Leonida,</hi> that you ſhould find in this place a thing of an ineſtimable value, though formerly it had beene diſdayned: Nay, <hi>Leonida,</hi> ſaid ſhe, he has told me more then that: particularly; Madam, ſaid he, you have two very contrary influences: the one the moſt unfortunate under the heavens; the other the moſt happie that can be deſired: And it is in your choice to take which you will: And to the end you may not deceive your ſelfe, be pleaſed to know, that you are and ſhall be coveted by many great and Noble perſonages, where vertues and merits may eaſily moove you: but if you meaſure your affection by their meritts, or their Love, and not by what I ſhall tell you: from the ſupream gods, I do Prognoſticate, that you will be the moſt miſerable woman alive. And to the end you may not be miſtaken in your choice, remember that ſuch a day you ſhall ſee at <hi>Marſeilles</hi> a Knight in ſuch a habit, who does and will court you for marriage: which if you permit, then I do pronounce your miſery. And therefore I adviſe you to ſhun ſuch a man and thinke upon him rather as your ſad fate, then as your ſervant: on the contrary, obſerve well the place which is repreſented in this Mirror, for on ſuch a day at ſuch an hour you ſhall there meet a man, in whoſe affection the heavens has placed all your felicitie: if you can ſo order it, that he do Love you, never beleeve the gods againe, if you become not more happie then you can deſire: but be ſure, that the firſt of you two who ſhall meet, be the firſt that ſhall begin Love. This, <hi>Leonida,</hi> is as cleere as the Sun at noone, and I do already perceive that his predictions are true. For I ſeeing this Shepheard firſt, I muſt tell you truly, I find ſome ſparkes of affection towards him. Good heavens! Madam (ſaid <hi>Leonida</hi> unto her) do you intend to place your Love upon a Shepheard? do you not remember who you are? I do ſo, <hi>Leonida,</hi> ſaid ſhe, and you muſt know that Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards are men as well as <hi>Druides</hi> and Knights, and their Nobleneſſe is as great as others, both being ſprung from one and the ſame originall: ſo as if this Shepheard be well borne, why ſhould I not think him as worthy of me as any other: The truth is Madam, ſaid <hi>Leon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> diſgrace it as you will, he is a Shepheard: The truth is, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> he is a well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed man. But Madam, anſwered <hi>Leonida,</hi> you who are ſo high a Nymph, Lady; after <hi>Amaſis,</hi> of all theſe goodly Countries: can your courage deſcend ſo low as to Love a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53526:9"/>
man of common ranke? a Ruſtique a Shepheard, a man not worth a ſtraw? Friend, replyed <hi>Galathea,</hi> remember that <hi>Enone</hi> became a Shepheardeſſe for <hi>Paris</hi> his ſake, and when ſhe loſt him, She ſhed many a bitter teare. Madam, laid <hi>Leonida, Paris</hi> was a Kings ſonne; and the error of another, ought not to move you to the like. If it be an error, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſhe, the blame is in the gods who adviſe me unto it by the Oracle of their <hi>Druides:</hi> but, my freind, <hi>Celadon</hi> is not ſo farre off in kindred from <hi>Paris:</hi> are they not both come from the ſame originall? Did you not heare what <hi>Silvia</hi> ſaid of him and his Father? You muſt know they are not ſhepheards out of any want, but becauſe they would enjoy that ſweet and harmleſſe kind of life. But deare Madam, added <hi>Leonida,</hi> can you thus forget the affection and ſervices of the generous <hi>Lindamour?</hi> I am not willing, ſaid <hi>Galathea</hi> that oblivion ſhould be the recompence of his ſervices: but I am unwilling withall, that my affection unto him ſhould be the utter ruine of all my happineſſe. Oh Madam (ſaid <hi>Leoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da)</hi> I beſeech you remember how full of fidelity he hath ever been. Oh my friend, ſaid <hi>Galathea</hi> I beſeech you conſider what it is to be eternally miſerable. Certainly, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> an extream affection, a pure fidelitie, the imployment of a whole age and continuall ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought not to be ſo long entertained, but merited a better requitall then a change. For God ſake Madam, conſider what impoſtures all theſe Fortune tellers are: they vent for truthes the idle imaginations of their fond dreames: they are flat lyars, ſince of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred predictions hardly one happens truly, they are ſo fooliſhly ignorant, ſince for all their buſineſſe in others mens matters they know not their owne fortune: will you bee perſwaded by the fantaſticall talke of this fellow, to make that man miſerable who hath bin ſo much yours? Look but a little upon his Love; conſider what hazards he hath run for you; how he fought with <hi>Polemas;</hi> what deſpaire he was then in; what torments you now prepare for him, and how hee will certainly invent ſome way of death to himſelfe when he knowes it. <hi>Galathea</hi> did ſhake her head, and thus anſwered; <hi>Leonida,</hi> I muſt not now thinke upon either <hi>Lindamor</hi> or <hi>Polemas</hi> as heretofore; but upon my owne eternall either happineſſe or miſery; the motives you uſe are very good for your ſelfe, who will be concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned no further then to a little pittie: but for my ſelfe they are very dangerous, ſince the miſery does not menace me for a day but for ever. Tis true, were I in your place, and you in mine, perhaps I ſhould give the ſame advice: but certainly an eternall miſery is very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible: As for the fabulous conjectures of thoſe Divinres which you ſpeak of; I will for your ſake beleeve, that perhaps they will not ſo fall out, and perhaps they will but I beſeech you tell me, do you think any prudent perſon will for the ſatisfaction of another, conclude all his happineſſe or all his miſery upon a perhaps? But if you Love me, uſe no more of this diſcourſe: for if you do, I ſhall thinke you aime at the ſatisfaction of <hi>Lindamure,</hi> more then mine. And as for him, never feare, but he will find out a better way of care then death: reaſon and time will temper him how many deſparato's have you ſeene, whom a little time has not perfectly cured? Theſe two faire Nymphs thus diſcourſed, when they ſaw <hi>Silvia</hi> returne, and therefore they broke off this diſcourſe; but <hi>Galathea</hi> ſaid thus unto <hi>Leonida,</hi> conſider that not only my contentment, but all my felicitle is at the ſtake: <hi>Leonida</hi> could not reply, beeauſe <hi>Silvia</hi> was ſo neere as to heare their diſcourſe. She being come, <hi>Galathea</hi> underſtood that <hi>Celadon</hi> was awake, for liſtning at the dore, ſhe heard him ſigh and groane: Tis very true, that a little while after their departure from his chamber, he did waken and the Sun ſhining very ſplendently upon his bed, as he opened his eyes he was ſo dazled that being confuſed with ſo great a light, he knew not where he was: his laſt dayes paine had much aſtoniſhed him, but at that time he was without any pain; ſo as remembring his fall into the River and the opinion which he had a little before of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, and now finding himſelfe in ſuch a glorious light, he knew not what to thinke, unleſſs that Love had raviſhed him into heaven in recompence of his fidelitie: and that which moſt induced him to this opinion, was to ſee the chamber hung with ſuch rich hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and admirable pictures, ſo lively that his yet weake eye could not diſtinguiſh them from ſubſtances. On the one ſide, he ſaw <hi>Saturne</hi> leaning upon her ſithe with her dangling long treſſes, her forehead wrinkled, her eyes ſullen, her Eagle noſe, her mouth beſmeared with blood and yet full with a morſell of her children, one of which halfe eaten was an her left hand which by the prints of teeth did emblem cruelty to the life. This little infant was reverſed, ſprawling with heeles upward and armes hanging downwards, all ſmeared with blood which trickled from the wound which this hag had made with her teeth, whoſe long and dangling haire did drop with blood in which it had been ſteeped her nervous and uglie armes were growne over in many places with grieſly haire, as well as her leane and withered
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53526:10"/>
thighes: She trode upon heapes of bones ſome growne white with antiquitie, others green and halfe fleſhy. All about him was nothing but peeces of broken ſcepters crownes craſhed into peeces, ruined edifices, ſo as only ſome ſleight reſemblance of what they had beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained. A little further off was to be ſeene the picture of great <hi>Jupiter</hi> with an enflamed countenance, but grave and full of Majeſtie, in his eyes, a mixture of benignitie and terror: with a Croune upon his head: in his left hand a Scepter, which he reſted upon his thigh where was to be ſeene the ſcarre which he gott, when by the imprudence of the Nymph <hi>Semele,</hi> to ſave little <hi>Bacchus,</hi> he was forced to open that place, and carry the marke of it unto the end of his tearme. In the other hand he held his three poynted Thunderbolt, ſo well repreſented, that it ſeemed to fly from thence through the Aire. His feet trampled upon a great Globe: and neere him was a great Eagle which carried in her crooked beak a Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt: upon the back of this bird did ride the little <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mimede,</hi> cloathed after the mode of the Inhabitants on the mountaine <hi>Ida;</hi> fat, plump, faire Golden and curled Lockes: with one hand he ſtroked the head of the bird; and with the other he offered to take hold of <hi>Jupiters</hi> Thunderbolt but the bird with her traine did repulſe his feeble arme. Cloſe by, ſtood the Baſin and Eure out of which this little Skinker powred out <hi>Nectar</hi> unto his Maſter: and this little officer, powring it upon the hands of <hi>Jupiter:</hi> he let the Eure fall and looked back as if aſhamed of his act. At the feet of this God was a great Tun: and all about him the Vowes, Prayers, and Sacrifices of Mortals variouſly repreſented; for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were figured by ſmoke intermingled with fire: and vowes and prayers were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by ſuch light <hi>Ideas,</hi> as the eye might know the meaning of them This diſcourſe would be too long, if I ſhould relate every picture particularly: for the chamber was full of them. <hi>Venus</hi> alſo in a Sea ſhell amongſt the reſt, looked upon the wound which the Grecian gave her in the Trojan warre: and litle <hi>Cupid</hi> looked upon her by the Lamp of the too curious <hi>Psyche;</hi> And this ſo well repreſented, that the Shepheard could not diſcerne it from counterfeit. When he was thus deepe in contemplation, the three Nymphes came into his chamber, whoſe beautie and Majeſty, did more plunge him into admiration That which moſt helped on his conceipt of being dead, was, his fancying the three Nymphes to be the three Graces, eſpecially ſeeing the litle Merill amongſt them whoſe ſtature, beautie, plumpneſſe, Golden Lockes and Jolly Lookes ſeemed unto him, a <hi>Cupid.</hi> And though he was much confuſed in himſelfe, yet his courage which was alwayes above the qualitie of a Shepheard did prompt him unto ſo much confidence, as to aske them in what place he was. Unto which <hi>Galathea</hi> anſwered <hi>Celadon</hi> you are in a place where the people of it do intend your perfect cure; and we are thoſe who finding you floting in the water, did bring you hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where you have full power to command whatſoever you pleaſe. Then <hi>Silvia,</hi> ſtepped forward &amp; ſaid is it poſſible <hi>Celadon</hi> you ſhould not know me? Did you never ſee me in your Village? I hope faire Nymph (anſwered <hi>Celadon)</hi> that the condition I am in, will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the frailty of my memory; Do you not remember <hi>Silvia,</hi> (ſaid ſhe) and two of her companions, who went to ſee your ſports upon the day which you dedicated to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe <hi>Venus?</hi> And after you had won the courſe, <hi>Silvia</hi> was ſhe who gave you a Garland of Flowers which you did preſently put upon the head of the Shepheardeſſe <hi>Aſtrea?</hi> I know not whether theſe paſſages be vaniſhed out of your memorie; but I am ſure when you Crowned <hi>Aſtrea</hi> with my Garland, every one did wonder at it, by reaſon of the emnitie which was betweene your two families; particularly betweene your father <hi>Alcippes,</hi> and <hi>Alces</hi> the Father of <hi>Aſtrea:</hi> And when I enquired the occaſion of it, I could not learne any further, then that <hi>Amarillis</hi> being the Miſtriſſe of thoſe two Shepheards, they did Rival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like perpetually quarrell, untill ſuch time as <hi>Amarillis</hi> married your Father: and then <hi>Alces</hi> and the prudent <hi>Hippolita</hi> marrying together, they did both of them harbor an inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate hatred againſt them: ſo <hi>Celadon,</hi> you ſee I know you, and have given you good teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of what I ſay. The Shepheard hearing this, did by degrees recollect into his memorie all ſhe ſaid, but he was ſo aſtoniſhed that he knew not how to anſwere, for knowing <hi>Silvia</hi> to be the Nymph of <hi>Amaſis,</hi> and by reaſon of his Rurall life, having no acquaintance with her nor her companions, he could not now imagine how he ſhould come amongſt them. At laſt he replyed; all you ſay, faire Nymph, is moſt true, and I remember that upon the Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall of <hi>Venus,</hi> three Nymphes did beſtow three Garlands: It was my fortune to winne that of running: <hi>Lycidas</hi> my Brother won, that of leaping, and gave his Garland unto <hi>Phillis;</hi> and <hi>Silvander</hi> did winn that of ſinging, and preſented it to the ſage <hi>Belinda.</hi> But truly, I cannot remember the names of thoſe Nymphes the doners, only we contented our ſelves with knowing that they were the Nymphes of <hi>Amaſis</hi> and <hi>Galathea:</hi> for we alas, are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53526:10"/>
Country Inhabitants of fields and woods, and our wits are not Calculated for any higher Meridian, and therefore made no further inquity of you. Have you met with no further knowledge of us ſince that (ſaid <hi>Galathea?)</hi> The information that I had (anſwered the Shepheard) was from the diſcourſe which my Father made of his fortunes, in which I have often obſerved him to mention <hi>Amaſis,</hi> but I am not at all acquainted with any particulars concerning her, though I have much deſired it. Your deſire, Shepheard, replyed <hi>Galathea,</hi> ſhall be ſatisfied, and I will tell you, both who <hi>Amaſis</hi> is, and who we are.</p>
            <p>Know therefore, welcome Shepheard, that Anciently this Country now called <hi>Forreſts,</hi> all floated with a deepe Abyſſe of waters, &amp; only the high Mountaines about it was uncove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red except ſome hills in the middeſt of the plaine, as the Rock of <hi>Iſoures</hi> &amp; mount <hi>Verdon:</hi> ſo as all the Inhabitants did live upon the tops of the Mountaines. The Ancient families of this Country, have their names engraved upon old ruines, upon the tops of the hills. But about fourteen or fifteen ages ſince, a Romane who in ten yeares conquered all the Gaules, did cut ſome of the Mountaines, by which the water rann away and drained our plaines: which ſeemed ſo pleaſant unto him as he would needs make them habitable: and to that end cauſed all thoſe who lived on the Mountaines to come and live in the plaines and cauſed the firſt building there, to be called after his owne name <hi>Julius.</hi> And becauſe the humid plaines produced abundance of Trees, ſome ſay the country was called <hi>Forreſts,</hi> and the people <hi>Forreſters;</hi> whereas before they were called the <hi>Seguſians:</hi> but thoſe were much deceived. For the name of <hi>Forreſt</hi> did come from <hi>Forum,</hi> a little Towne which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans built and called <hi>Forum Seguſianorum,</hi> as if they would have ſaid, the place or the marſh of the <hi>Seguſians,</hi> which indeed was onely the place where they kept their Armes whilſt they were putting their neighbour Countries into order.</p>
            <p>This, <hi>Celadon,</hi> is the antiquitie of this Province, as ſome do confidently hold; but there are two opinions quite contrary. The Romans ſay that when our plaines were all covered with water, the chaſte goddeſſe <hi>Diana,</hi> thought the place ſo pleaſant that ſhe dwelt there ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much: for her <hi>Driades</hi> and <hi>Amadriades,</hi> did live and hunt in thoſe great woods and high hills, which circled about this great Levell of waters: and becauſe there was no great ſtore of Fountaines, ſhe came hither often with her <hi>Naiades</hi> which alſo dwelt here: but when the waters were let out, the <hi>Naiades</hi> were forced to follow, and go with them into the wide Ocean. So as the Goddeſſe loſing halfe her Nymphs, and not being able to take her full ſwinge of delight with ſo ſmall a Traine, ſhe made choice of ſome daughters of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall <hi>Druides</hi> and Knights, and joyned them unto the Nymphs which remained, unto whom alſo ſhe gave the name of Nymphs. But ſo it hapned, that many amongſt them, ſome being brought up under fond and tender Mothers, others uſed to the courtſhip of ſervants; and not being able to take the paines of hunting, nor loſe the memorie of their affectionate ſervants, they would needs go back to their houſes againe and Marrie. At which the Goddeſſe was ſo incenſed that She forſooke this prophane Country, and did fly from that vice which ſhe ſo much abhorred. But not to puniſh the vertues of ſome for the errours of others, before ſhe departed ſhe did for ever moſt ignominiouſly baniſh out of the Country, all thoſe who had beene faultie, and made choice of one, unto whom ſhe gave the ſame Authoritie which ſhe had over all the Country, and willed that the Race of this one ſhould have all the Soveraigne power for ever: And ever after ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to marry. Yet expreſly forbidding that any man ſhould ever ſucced her. Since this time there hath been no abuſe amongſt us, &amp; our Lawes have been ſince moſt inviolably obſerved. But our <hi>Druides</hi> do tell a quite contrary tale: For they ſay that our great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Galathea;</hi> daughter unto the King of <hi>Celtes,</hi> wife of the great <hi>Hercules,</hi> and Mother of <hi>Galathea</hi> who gave name unto the <hi>Gaules,</hi> that were before called <hi>Celtes,</hi> being infinitly in Love with her husband did follow him whither ſoever his courage and vertue did invite him againſt the Monſters and Gyants: At that time, theſe mountaines which ſeperate us from <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vergne,</hi> and thoſe more on the left hand which are called <hi>Cemene</hi> and <hi>Gebene,</hi> were a retreat unto ſome Gyants, who were terrible unto all the Country. <hi>Hercules</hi> being adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed thereof, went thither and becauſe he did infinitly love his deare <hi>Galathea,</hi> he left her in this Country, which was neareſt to him, &amp; where ſhe might take much pleaſure, either in hunting or in the company of the Country Ladies: and becauſe ſhe was Queen of all the <hi>Gaules,</hi> when <hi>Hercules</hi> had vanquiſhed the Gyants, &amp; neceſſitie of affaires called him away; before her departure, in eternall memorie of the delight ſhe tooke in that Country, ſhe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned that which the Romans ſay the Goddeſſe <hi>Diana</hi> did. But whether it was <hi>Galathea</hi> or <hi>Diana,</hi> yet ſo it is, as if by a ſupernaturall priviledge, we have ever ſince been maintained
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53526:11"/>
in our priviledges, ſince none ever troubled our tranquillitie. Nay <hi>Alaricke</hi> King of the <hi>Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots,</hi> when with <hi>Aquitaine</hi> he had conquered all the Provinces on this ſide <hi>Loire,</hi> knowing our ſtatutes, did confirme the priviledges, and without any uſurpation, did leave us in our antient freedome. Perhaps you will thinke it ſtrange I ſhould ſo particularly talke of things which tranſcend the capacity of my age; but you muſt know that <hi>Pimander</hi> my Father was very inquiſitive unto the Antiquities of this country; ſo as the moſt knowing <hi>Druides</hi> did commonly make it their diſcourſe with him, &amp; I gleaned ſuch fragments from them as moſt delighted me. Thus I came to know that <hi>Amaſis</hi> my Mother was in a continued line deſcended from her whom the Goddeſſe <hi>Diana</hi> or <hi>Galathea</hi> did elect: ſhe being ſole Lady of all theſe Countryes, and having one Sonne called <hi>Clidaman;</hi> She brought up with us many young maides and daughters of <hi>Druides</hi> and Knights, where being in ſo good a ſchoole, they might learne all the vertues which their age and ſexe was capable of. The Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins go habited as you ſee us, in the ſame faſhion which <hi>Diana</hi> or <hi>Galathea</hi> was accuſtomed to weare, and which in memorie of her we have conſtantly kept. Now, <hi>Celadon,</hi> I have acquainted you with our condition; and I am confident that before you part from us (for I would have you ſee us altogether before you go) you will confeſſe, that our aſſembly will not yeild unto any other, either in vertue or beautie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Celadon</hi> now knowing who theſe Nymphes were, he knew alſo what reverence was due unto them; and though his converſation had been onely amongſt his equall Shepheards, yet his good education had taught him how to behave himſelfe unto his ſuperiors. After he had rendred them all the honour which he thought himſelfe obliged unto, I cannot chuſe but wonder, ſaid he, to find my ſelfe amongſt ſo many great Nymphs: and I who am but a ſimple ſillie ſhepheard, to receive ſo many favours from them. <hi>Celadon</hi> (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Galathea)</hi> vertue, in what place ſoever it is will merit both Love and Honour as well when it is ſhrowded under the cheap habit of a ſhepheard, as under the rich and glorious Purple of a King; and for your particular, you are in no leſſe conſideration amongſt us, then the greateſt of the <hi>Druides</hi> or Nobles of our Court; for ſince your merits are as great, our favours ſhall be no leſſe. And as for your wonder at finding your ſelfe amongſt us, know that it proceeds from the Providence of the Gods, who have ſo ordained it (as at more leaſure you may know) either becauſe they would not have ſo much vertue loſt in the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts;</hi> or, intending to make you greater then you are, they will by you, make a perſon who loves you, happy: live then, and be happy, for you need deſire no more then your health. Madam (anſwered the Shepheard who did not well underſtand this language) If I muſt deſire mine owne health, it ſhall be only to render you ſervice, in exchange of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny favours which you are pleaſed to conferre upon me: But for my part, I muſt thinke of no other courſe but returning to the woods and Paſtures; otherwiſe the ſolemne vow which our Fathers have made unto the Gods, will accuſe us to be unworthy children of ſuch Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. What vow is that, ſad the Nymph? The Hiſtory of it would be too long replyed <hi>Celadon,</hi> but in ſhort this, Madam; All thoſe about the Rivers of <hi>Loire, Turan, Argent</hi> and all the reſt of the Rivers, have ſeverall yeares with one accord, aſſembled in that great Plaine which is neere Mount <hi>Verdum,</hi> and conſidering the Inconveniences which ambition and deſire of rule, in that people called Romans, hath brought upon all their Neighbours, they do all by mutuall conſent ſweare to fly all ambition for ever, and they and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to live peaceably in the habit of ſhepheards. And ever ſince it hath been obſerved (ſo pleaſing was this vow unto the Gods) that whoſoever broke this oath, did never proſper. And amongſt us, my Father is the moſt remarkable example: So as now ſeeing the will of heaven is to have us live in reſt, we have a new ratified this vow, with ſo many ſacred oathes, as he that breakes it ſhall be moſt deteſtable. I do profeſſe, anſwered the Nymph, I am very glad to heare this: for I never knew before, the reaſon why ſo many good and antient fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies have forſaken Townes and ſpend their dayes in woods and ſolitary places. But, <hi>Celadon,</hi> if your condition will permit you, I ſhall be very glad to heare you relate the fortune of your Father <hi>Alſippes,</hi> and why he betooke himſelfe to that kind of life, which he had ſo long laid aſide; for I am moſt confident, it is moſt worthy of knowledge. Then the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, though not very well, yet conſtrained himſelfe to obey her, and began thus.</p>

                  <hi>The Hiſtory of</hi> Alcippes.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madam,</hi> you command me to relate the moſt intricate ſtory in the world; and in which one may learne that whoſoever contrives the hurt of another muſt prepare himſelfe for a great part of it. In obedience therefore to your commands I ſhall briefly tel you, what I have gleaned from the ordinary diſcourſe of him, unto whom all the things hapned: for, to make us more ſenſible of our happineſſe in living at reſt, my Father hath often related unto us his ſtrange fortunes. Be pleaſed to know then, Madam that <hi>Alcippes,</hi> being educated by his Father in the ſimplicitie of a ſhepherd, had ever a Genius far different from his education; and any thing that ſmelt of a Town pleaſed him much better then a Field: So as when he was a little boy, his delight was in aſſembling other boys together, and ſetting them into order; and do what the grave Signiors could, he would ſtill be teaching them how to arme themſelves, and ſhoot in bowes. The Ancients of our village, who obſerved his actions did Propheſie great troubles to enſue upon their country, and that <hi>Alcippes</hi> was of too turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a ſpirit to be kept within the compaſſe of a ſhepherd. When his age became more virile he fell in Love with the ſhepherdeſſe <hi>Amarillis,</hi> who was then ſecretly corrted by another ſhepheard called <hi>Alces.</hi> And <hi>Alcippes</hi> having ſo good a conceipt of himſelfe, that he thought any ſhepherdeſs would bid his affection welcome whenſoever it was offered, he reſolved not to uſe much artifice, in declaring himſelfe: ſo as meeting her at one of the Sacrifices unto <hi>Pan.</hi> as ſhe was returning home to her village he ſaid unto her; I could never have believed my ſelfe ſo weake, as not to reſiſt the blowes of an enemy, who hath woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me and never thought upon it. She anſwered him, that he who wounds againſt his will ought not to be called an enemy. But I do find it otherwiſe, anſwered he, and therefore I may very well give this name unto you: who I? replyed ſhe, I was never ſo, either in thought or act: for I ever ſet a great valew upon your merit. This is one of the wounds you give me, ſaid he: but I ſee you can carry Love in your eyes and in your mouth, but will not harbour it in your heart: The ſhepherdeſſe then finding her ſelfe ſurpriſed, and that he did meane matter of Love, ſhe anſwered: I do ſet ſuch a value upon your vertue <hi>Alcippes</hi> as I ought to do; but as for any Love, whereof you ſpeak, beleeve me I have none for any, either in my eyes or heart; eſpecially for ſuch pittyfull ſpirits as can content themſelves to live like Savages in woods. It is not the election of love but my deſtinie which makes me yours, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the ſhepherd; and ſuch a reſemblance of humor there is betwixt us, that I have borne a moſt deadly hatred unto a ſhepherds life, which you ſcorne ſo much, even from my very cradle: I do proteſt that if changing my condition will promote me into your favour I wil immediatly quit my flock and ſheephooke, and live amongſt men, not amongſt Salvages. You may change your condition, anſwered <hi>Amarillis,</hi> but not me; for I am reſolved to be ſtill ſo much my ſelfe, as not to give my affection unto another. If therefore you would have us live as formerly we have done leave off this diſcourſe of affection and Love, and talke of ſuch things as we were wont, elſe thinke it not ſtrange that I baniſh you my preſence ſince it is impoſſible that Love and the Civilitie of <hi>Amarillis</hi> ſhould dwell together. <hi>Alſippe</hi> not expecting ſuch an anſwer was ſo confounded that it was a long while before he could anſwer but, being come to himſelfe, he was perſwaded, that it was the baſhfullneſſe of her age and ſexe, not want of any good will to him, made her give ſuch an anſwer: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he anſwered: whatſoever you are pleaſed to be or ſay, I ſhall never be any thing but your devoted ſervant. And if the command you have impoſed upon me were not incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with my affection, you may moſt confidently beleeve, that nothing in the world can make me diſobey. But I beſeech you excuſe and ſuffer me to continue my deſigne which is onely a teſtimony of your merit: for whether you will or no, I am reſolved to proſecute it. The ſhepherdeſſe then turning her eye ſmilingly upon him, I know not <hi>Alſippe</hi> (ſaid ſhe unto him) whether this be for ſome wager, or out of willfullneſſe, that you ſpeake thus. It is both (anſwered he) for I have laid a wager with my deſires to overcome you, or to die: and this reſolution is changed into obſtinate willfullneſſe, ſince nothing can divert me from that oath which I have taker. I ſhould have been very glad, anſwered <hi>Amarillis,</hi> if you had made choice of ſome other marke for your importunities: Nay, nay, ſaid the ſhepherd, all this cannot make me alter my deſigne; Then think not much, replyed <hi>Amarillis,</hi> if I be as firme in my obſtinacie, as you are in your importunitie. The ſhepherd would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, but he was interrupted by many ſhepherds comming towards them. So as <hi>Amarillis</hi> for a concluſion ſaid unto him in a low voice, you will do me a great diſpleaſure <hi>Alcippe,</hi> if your reſolution ſhould be knowne: I can be contented to know your follies, but ſhould,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53526:12"/>
be much diſpleaſed if any other ſhould know them. Thus ended my Fathers firſt diſcourſe with <hi>Amarillis,</hi> which did infinitly angment his deſire of ſerving her. As they went along the way they met <hi>Celion</hi> and <hi>Belinda,</hi> who were obſerving two turtles, billing and making Love unto each other, not caring a ſtraw who ſaw them, which gave <hi>Alcippes</hi> an occaſion to remember the laſt commands of <hi>Amarillis,</hi> and to ſing theſe verſes; and becauſe his voice was very good, every one did lend a ſilent eare.</p>

                  <l>All faculties do droop and mourne, till <hi>Amarillis</hi> do returne.</l>

               </lg>
               <p>But he, not being able to abide in that place where he was wont to ſee her, he reſolved (whatſoever came on't) to be gone; and as ſoone as he ſought for an occaſion, he found it to his hearts deſire. A little before, the Mother of <hi>Amaſis</hi> died: and Preparations were in hand to entertaine her in the great Citie of <hi>Marſelles</hi> as their new Lady, with abundance of Tryumph. This ſolemnity, did draw thither out of curloſitie, moſt of the Country: and amongſt the reſt, my Father obtained leave to be one: from hence did ſpring much of his miſerie. He was in the prime of his age; faire, beyond any in the Country; his hair flaxen which naturally curled in rings, and which he wore very long; in briefe, Madam he was ſuch a one as I beleeve Love did chuſe out for a marke of revenge; and thus it was. There was a certain Lady which had ſeen him and loved him in ſuch a ſecret diſguiſe that we could never know her name. When he came firſt to <hi>Marſelles,</hi> he came as a ſhepherd, but in a very handſom mode; and to the end he ſhould not run into any extravagancyes, as he did in his owne Hamlet his Father ſent two ſhepherds with him as guardians, the principall of which was called <hi>Cleantes,</hi> a man whoſe humour was ſutable unto my Fathers, inſomuch as he affected him exceedingly. This <hi>Cleantes</hi> had a Son called <hi>Clindor</hi> equall in age with my Father, and had a naturall inclination to Love <hi>Alcippe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alcippe,</hi> in retaliation of this affection, did alſo Love him above any other; which was ſo pleaſing unto <hi>Cleantes,</hi> that he could not deny my Father any thing and therefore, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had obſerved how other Gallants were habited: how they were armed; and how they fought at Barriers, both of them beſeeched <hi>Cleantes</hi> for ſuch allowance as might put them into the equipage of appearing amongſt thoſe Knights and Gallants. Have you ſo much courage (ſaid <hi>Cleantes</hi> unto them) as to equal your ſelves with them? Why not? (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Alcippes)</hi> have I not armes and thighes as well as they? Though you have, (ſaid <hi>Cleantes)</hi> yet you have not learned the Garbe, and civill deportment of Townes. Tis true (anſwered he) but ſuch ceremonies are not ſo difficult as to blaſt the hopes of quickly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them. You have not yet the uſe of your armes (ſaid <hi>Cleantes)</hi> nor know how to fence, or fight as they do: Tis no matter replyed <hi>Alcippes,</hi> we have courage enough to ſupply that defect. Why would you leave off a country life? Said <hi>Cleantes;</hi> what ſhould men do in woods (Anſwered <hi>Alcippes)</hi> and what good can men learne amongſt beaſts? It will vexe you, ſaid <hi>Alcippe,</hi> to be ſlighted by the Ladies, who will ſlight and ſcorne you, and upbraid you with the name of ſhepheards. If to be a Shepheard be ignominious, (ſaid <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cippe)</hi> let us own that profeſſion no longer; and if it be not, then the diſdain will not hurt us: for if they do, I will indeavour by my actions to get honour and eſteem amongſt them. At laſt <hi>Cleantes</hi> ſeeing their reſolutions to change their lives; well children (ſaid he) ſince you are thus reſolved, let me tell you that though you paſſe under the notion of ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, yet your extraction is from the beſt branch in the Country, and the nobleſt Knights in all <hi>France,</hi> have no better a pedigree then you have, though your Ancienters upon ſome certain conſiderations, made choice of ſuch a retired kind of life. Never fear, therefore, the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53526:13"/>
finding a good reception amongſt theſe Cavaliers, ſince the very beſt amongſt them is of your own blood. Theſe words, did kindle the ſparks of their deſire unto a flame; and made them more forward to put their reſolutions into execution; never reflecting upon the future, nor thinking what inconveniency that kind of life might bring them; nor dorring at the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>Alcippes</hi> Father. <hi>Cleantes</hi> provides them all neceſſaries; they did quickly inſinuate themſelves into acquaintance, and get love amongſt the beſt; <hi>Alcippes</hi> was grown ſo expert in armes; that he was accompted one of the beſt Knights of his time.</p>
               <p>During this feaſt, which laſted two monthes, a certain Lady as I told you before, had ſeen my Father, and was ſo much taken with him that ſhe deviſed this Stratagem to bring her ends about. Upon a day when my Father was in the Temple; an old woman came and ſet her ſelfe cloſe by him: and ſeeming as if ſhe were at her prayers, ſhe ſaid two or three times, <hi>Alcippes, Alcippes,</hi> but never looked towards him. He hearing himſelfe named, did think to ask her what ſhe would have with him, but ſeeing her eyes turned another way; he thought ſhe had ſpoken to ſome other. She perceiving that he heard her, continued, <hi>Alcip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes,</hi> it is to you I ſpeak, though I did not look upon you; if you will enjoy a better fortune, then ever any Knight in our Court did, meet me in the twilight at the <hi>Piazza</hi> neere the Pallace, and there I will accquaint you further. <hi>Alcippe</hi> hearing this, anſwered her with a regardleſſe look, that he would be there: and he failed not. For as ſoon as night came, he went to the place appointed, where he tarried not long for the old woman, who mufled up in a taffatle hood, took him aſide and ſaid unto him, Young man thou art the happieſt man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live in the affection of the faireſt Lady, and greateſt beautie in all this Court, whom (upon ſuch conditions as I ſhall require) if thou wilt, thou ſhalt enjoy, and receive fullneſſe of delight. Young <hi>Alcippe</hi> hearing this faire offer, asked who the Lady was? Firſt, ſaid ſhe, you muſt promiſe never to enquire her name, but to keep your happy fortune extreamly ſecret; the next condition is, that you let me blind your eyes, when I conduct you to her. <hi>Alcippe</hi> told her, that as for enquiring her name, and keeping ſecreſy, he would moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly conſent; but as for his being blinded, he would never ſuffer it. What doſt thou fear man, (ſaid ſhe): I fear not any thing, anſwered he, but I would have mine eyes at liberty. Fond young man (ſaid the old woman) what a novice yet thou art? Canſt thou find a heart to ſlight ſuch a fair opportunity upon ſuch eaſie conditions? Come come, never dorr at it, nor doubt any danger: where is the courage that thy preſence promiſeth? can any ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary perill affright thee from a moſt certain happineſſe? Then ſeeing him un willing; Curſed be thy mother (ſaid ſhe) who brought thee forth: thou haſt thy countenance &amp; thy courage more from her, then thy father: Young <hi>Alcippes</hi> could not hear the language of this angry old woman without laughing: and afterwards bethinking himſelfe what enemyes he had, he reſolved to go along with her, provided ſhe would let him weare his ſword; and ſo he ſuffered her to hood wink him, and conduct him whether ſhe would. I ſhould be too long and tedious, Madam, ſhould I relate every particular of this night: but after many turnings and windings, and perhaps ſeverall times one way, he was brought into a chamber, where blindfold, he was undreſſed by this old woman, and got into bed: A little after came the Lady who ſent for him, and went to bed unto him, where after the light was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away ſhe did unmuffle his eyes: but, do what he could, he could not draw one ſyllable from her. So as he roſe the next morning, and knew not who his bedfellow was, onely he imagined her to be young and fair: and an hour before day ſhe who brought him thither; came to conduct him back again with the ſame ceremonies: And it was agreed between them, that whenſoever he was to come again; he ſhould find a little ſtone in a corner of the <hi>Piazza</hi> the ſame morning.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe things thus paſſed, <hi>Alcippes</hi> Father dyed: ſo as he was ſole Maſter of himſelf; and had not the commands of <hi>Amarillis</hi> reſtrained him, perhaps he might have retired himſelfe into a Country life again. For all the favours of this unknowne Lady could not drive her out of his mind. The great gifts which he often received from her, could not do it: nor could the favours of <hi>Pimander</hi> and <hi>Amaſis,</hi> which he had obtained, have retained him from the woods. But, it being hard for a young ſpirit to keep any thing ſecret long, <hi>Clindor</hi> his dear friend ſeeing him ſpend after a vaſt rate, he asked him how he was able to maintaine ſo great an expence? At firſt he was ſomthing ſhie; but afterwards, told him his adventure of this unknown Lady; and how all the art he had, could not diſcover who ſhe was <hi>Clindor</hi> adviſed him the next time he went to cut off a peece of the fringe at the foot of the bed and the next morning to go unto all the houſes which he could ſuſpect, and try if he could find any ſuch bed; which he did; and by this trick my Father came to the knowledge
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53526:14"/>
of her who was ſo favourable unto him. Yet he ever kept it ſo ſecret, that neither <hi>Clindor,</hi> or any of his children could ever know it. But the firſt time he went to her after this, when he was ready to riſe in the morning he conjured her to conceal her ſelfe no longer, for he knew ſhe was ſuch a one. She, hearing her ſelfe named, was ready to ſpeak: yet ſhe kept ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, untill the old woman came: then when <hi>Alcippes</hi> was gone, ſhe terrified her with a thouſand meanaces, ſuppoſing that ſhe had diſcovered her unto him; ſo as the poor old band came trembling to my Father and told him that he had deceived her. Then he in a ſmiling manner told her his device which he had uſed, and that it was the invention of <hi>Clindor.</hi> She, extreamly glad of this diſcovery, after a thouſand denialls of it, went to tell this Lady of it. And when ſhe knew that <hi>Clindor</hi> was the inventor of this artifice, ſhe turned her anger againſt him, &amp; eaſily pardoned <hi>Alcippe,</hi> whom indeed ſhe could not hate: yet from that day ſhe never ſent for him again. And ſince nothing is ſo ſweet as revenge unto an offended ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, this woman was never at reſt till ſhe had ſprung a quarrell between <hi>Clindor</hi> and one that was Cozen unto <hi>Pimander,</hi> whom <hi>Clindor</hi> killed; and though he was purſued, yet by the help of <hi>Alcippes,</hi> he got into <hi>Anvergne</hi> and ſaved himſelfe: But <hi>Amaſis</hi> tranſacted ſo with <hi>Alerick</hi> King of the <hi>Viſigots</hi> who was then at <hi>Thoulouſe,</hi> as he did impriſon him at <hi>Uſſon</hi> with command unto his officers that they ſhould remit him into the hands of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,</hi> who intended his death. <hi>Alcippe</hi> left no ſtone unturned to obtain his pardon but all in vaine. Wherefore foreſeeing the inevitable ruine of his freind he reſolved at what rate ſoever, eyther to ſave him or die with him. He was then at <hi>Uſſon,</hi> as I told you before, a place ſo ſtrong, as it ſeemed meere folly to attempt the getting him out: however not being able to live without <hi>Clindor,</hi> he reſolved to be beforehand with thoſe who were to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Pimander:</hi> ſo as going away in a diſcontent, he get a dozen freinds, and came to the gates of the Caſtle, clad like Country fellowes, having under their jackets ſhort ſwords, and baskets on their armes, as if they came to ſell ſomething. I have ſince heard him ſay, that there was three Forts all one within another. Theſe reſolute Peaſants came to the outmoſt of them, where they found very few of the <hi>Viſigots</hi> upon the Guard: for moſt of them were gone into the Town, to provide neceſſaries for the Garriſon. Being come ſo neer, they offered their commodities to ſell at ſo cheap a rate, that almoſt all within came to buy them. Then my Father, ſpying his opportunity got him who guarded the gate by the neck, killed him; and at that very inſtant every one of his commpanions killed his man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in, kept the reſt out at the ſwords point: then running to the Priſons they found <hi>Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> and ſo many others, as being armed they thought able to maintaine the Garriſon. To abridge my diſcourſe, I will onely tell you Madam, that though upon the Alarme the gates of the Town were ſhut, yet they forced them and got out without the loſſe of one man, though the Governour who was killed there, did make a very brave reſiſtance. Thus was <hi>Clindor</hi> ſaved, &amp; <hi>Alerick</hi> being accquainted, that this enterprize was acted by my Father he was ſo incenſed againſt him, as he ſent to <hi>Amaſis</hi> to demand juſtice upon him &amp; ſhe unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to loſe his friendſhip, ſent preſently to ſeaſe upon my Father: but his friends gave him ſuch timely notice of it, that he got out of the Country, and joyned himſelfe with a Nation who a little after entred <hi>France</hi> and in hoſtile manner came as farr as the <hi>Roſne</hi> and <hi>Arar,</hi> and ſome part of the <hi>Allobroges;</hi> and being deſirous to enlarge their territories they made a fierce warr upon the <hi>Viſigots</hi> the <hi>Oſtrogots</hi> &amp; the Romans: amongſt theſe was my Father entertained, &amp; being known for a man of valour, was preſently honoured with ſeverall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. But within a few yeares, <hi>Gondioch</hi> King of this Nation dying, <hi>Gordebert</hi> his Sonn ſucceeded him in the Throne of <hi>Bourgundie:</hi> and being deſirous to ſettle his affaires in the beginning he contracted peace with his neighbours, marrying his Son <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> unto one of the Daughters of <hi>Theodorick</hi> King of the <hi>Oſtrogots:</hi> and to hold faire with <hi>Alerick</hi> who was implacably offended againſt <hi>Alcippes,</hi> he promiſed to entertaine him no longer. So as he departed thence, and cloſed with another people, who from the <hi>Reihn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> did ſeaſe upon part of <hi>France</hi> in ſpight of the <hi>Gaules</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> But Madam, the diſcourſe would be much too tedious ſhould I particulariſe every paſſage of this voyage; for from thence he was forced to <hi>London</hi> unto King <hi>Arthur,</hi> who as I have heard did at that time inſtitute the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Knights of the Round Table: afterwards being hunted out by <hi>Alerick,</hi> he paſſed the Seas, and went to <hi>Bizantium</hi> where the Emperour gave him the command of his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. But the Love to ones own country being above all others, my Father though in great favour with ſo many Emperours, yet had greater deſire to breathe in his own native aire: and Fortune did preſent the meanes unto him when he leaſt expected it. <hi>Alerick</hi> died: and <hi>Tyherre</hi> his Son ſucceeded him, who having many Brothers, had enough to do in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53526:14"/>
his own, without thinking upon his Fathers enemyes. And therefore, being deſirous to carry fair withall in the beginning of his Reigne, he publiſhed a generall Act of Oblivion, which pardoned all offences committed in his Kingdome. This was a good ſtep to <hi>Alcippes</hi> returne, if <hi>Pimander</hi> had once forgot the injurie which he received: yet as the <hi>Viſigots</hi> were inſtrumentall in his baniſhment, ſo Fortune would have them as forward in his repeal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> little before, (as I told you) <hi>Arthur,</hi> King of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> had inſtituted the Knights of the Round Table: an order conſiſting of a certain number of young vertuous men, who were obliged to go and ſeek adventures, to puniſh the wicked, to relieve the oppreſſed, and to defend the honour of Ladies. Then the <hi>Viſigots</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> which then dwelt in <hi>Pampo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luna,</hi> in imitation of this Order, did chuſe out a number of Knights, who went into many Countries and ſhewed their valour. And at that time, there came one of theſe <hi>Viſigots,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long wandring through many Countries, unto <hi>Marſelles;</hi> where having made his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed challenge, he vanquiſhed many of <hi>Pimanders</hi> Knights whoſe heads he all cut off, and as enſigns of his valour, ſent them unto a Lady in <hi>Spain</hi> whom he courted as his Miſtriſs Amongſt he reſt <hi>Amarillis</hi> loſt an Uncle, who, like my Father not reliſhing a Shepherds life, had betaken himſelfe to armes. As ſoon as <hi>Amarillis</hi> heard of this ſad Accident, ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted the news by letter unto my Father; not with any deſigne of his comming to her but only to make him a partner in her loſſe. Love, which ever prompts a noble ſoul unto a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand generous deſignes, would not permit my Father to know of <hi>Amarillis</hi> loſſe, and ſitt ſtill: but he reſolved immediatly upon revenge. Therefore with the Emperors leave he came diſguiſed into <hi>Cleantes</hi> houſe, who underſtanding his reſolution, did endeavour to diſſwade him, but Loves arguments were of more validity then his. One morning when <hi>Pimander</hi> was going to the Temple, <hi>Alcippes</hi> armed <hi>Cap a pe</hi> preſented himſelf before him; and though his helmet was up, yet his beard was ſo grown ſince his departure, that he was not knowable. As ſoon as <hi>Pimander</hi> underſtood his buſineſſe, he ſent an Herald to acquaint the <hi>Viſigot</hi> with it: To be ſhort, my Father overcame him; and preſented his ſword unto <hi>Pimander,</hi> who was exceedingly glad that this cruell <hi>Viſigot</hi> was vanquiſhed. Then, not making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe known unto any, except <hi>Amarillis,</hi> who ſaw him in the houſe of <hi>Cleantes,</hi> he returned unto <hi>Bizantium,</hi> where he found his accuſtomed entertainment. Mean while <hi>Cleantes</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nothing more then to ſee him in <hi>Forreſts</hi> at liberty, did diſcover him unto <hi>Pimander,</hi> who was extreamly deſirous to know the name of that man who fought with the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. <hi>Pimander</hi> at firſt was amazed; but afterwards being moved by the vertue of this man, he asked whether it was poſſible he ſhould be ſtill alive? To whom <hi>Cleantes</hi> made anſwer, relating all his long voyages and ſervices of ſo many Kings: Oh, ſaid <hi>Pimander,</hi> this mans vertue merits reward and not baniſhment: let him returne, and aſſure him that his deſerts ſhall find from me a full reward. I freely pardon him all that ever he did againſt me. Thus my Father, after he had been ſeaven yeares in <hi>Greece,</hi> returned into his Country, and was much honoured both by <hi>Pimander</hi> and <hi>Amaſis,</hi> who conferred upon him one of the greateſt offices about their perſons. Abundance of any thing cloys and faded deſires have no force in them. As ſoon as my Father, had taſted the favours of Fortune in a full meaſure, his taſt was glutted and he deſpiſed them. Some good Angell, intending to draw him out of that Gulfe, in which he had ſo often been ſo nigh a ſhipwrack, did inſpire him with ſuch conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations as theſe Come <hi>Alcippe,</hi> would he ſay unto himſelf, I muſt take thee under exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; what doeſt thou intend to do? Wouldeſt thou enjoy happineſſe before thou dyeſt? If thou wouldeſt; be confident, it is not to be found any where but in Tranquillity: if in tranquillity, then it muſt be farr from buſineſſe: if farr from buſineſſe, then far from the ambition of a Court: haſt thou not had ſufficient tryall of its inconſtancy? Conſider well with thy ſelfe; ambition is a deſire to command over many: and that many hath every one of them the ſame deſign as well as thee: they propoſe unto themſelves the very ſame wayes thou doſt; and ambition is ſo narrow a paſſage, that only one can keep it: ſo as thou muſt defend thy ſelfe againſt a thouſand, who will aſſault thee by a thouſand ſtratagems, or elſe thou muſt die; if thou doſt defend thy ſelfe, what tranquillitie, what reſt canſt thou expect? Thou muſt ſtand day and night upon thy Guard, both againſt friends and enemies: if thou doſt yeild, there is no creature ſo miſerable as a creſt-falne Courtier, out of favour. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe things <hi>Alcippes;</hi> thy Father and Anceſtors were full as wiſe as thou art; they well conſidered theſe things, and would never truſt themſelves upon the mutability of Fortune: Returne, returne therefore to thy native ſoil, caſt off thy Purple, and aſſume thy firſt habit; turne thy ſpeare into a ſpade, and thy ſword into a ſheephook there thou ſhalt meet with that tranquillity, which thou haſt ſought for, ſo many years, and couldſt never find it,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53526:15"/>
and which can never be found any where elſe. Theſe, Madam, were the conſiderations which brought my Father unto his firſt Profeſſion. Wherein he enjoyed the height of happineſſe: for he was ſo much beloved and honored by all his neighbours, that they held him for their Oracle; yet this was not the end: For he was no ſooner at home, but Love began to open his firſt wound: and <hi>Amarillis</hi> did coſt him more miſery, then all the reſt of his misfortunes. Then did he revive that Device which he bore in all his travells which was in French <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne de Gray,</hi> meaning thereby <hi>Peine I'ay;</hi> in Engliſh, The miſery I endure. From this Love of his did grow an inveterate hatred. For <hi>Alces, Aſtreas</hi> Father, was alſo infinitly in Love with <hi>Amarillis;</hi> and <hi>Amaril is,</hi> during my Fathers exile, did, by the command of her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, permit it: on the other ſide <hi>Alcippe,</hi> though he had caſt off his habit of Chivalrie, yet he retained his courage; and not being able to admit of any Rivall, did often fall foule with <hi>Alces,</hi> who alſo had courage enough; And it was the thought of everyone, that if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of <hi>Amarillis</hi> had not conſented to give her unto <hi>Alcippes,</hi> one of them two had died for it. But though this marriage ſtopped all quarrells, yet there ſtill remaines ſuch roots of hatred, as will never be quite eradicated ſo as ſtill there is no familiarity between <hi>Alces</hi> and <hi>Alcippes:</hi> Thus much fair Nymph (ſaid he unto <hi>Silvia)</hi> perhaps you have heard in our Town, when you were there for I am Son unto <hi>Alcippes</hi> and <hi>Amarillis;</hi> and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> is Daughter unto <hi>Alces</hi> and <hi>Hippolyta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Celadon</hi> ended his diſcourſe, and doubtleſſe not without much paine: for ſpeaking was troubleſome to him: and this was the reaſon he did ſo abreylate his relation. But <hi>Galathea</hi> was unimaginably ſatisfied, when ſhe heard of what Parents this Shepherd was deſcended, whom ſhe ſo much Loved.</p>
               <p>As long as day laſted, theſe faire Nymphes ſo entertained <hi>Celadon,</hi> that had not <hi>Aſtreas</hi> change infinitly diſpleaſed him, he had found no great cauſe to be weary of them: for they were very fair, and alſo full of diſcretion: Yet as the caſe was with him, he could not chuſe but deſire to be alone and foreſeeing that would not be till night, which would force them away, he wiſhed for it every minute. When he was moſt alone, he thought himſelfe beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied: for night being come, and the Nymphes retired to their chambers, his own thoughts came to accompany him with ſuch cruell Memorandums, as made him uncapable of any other companions diſmall deſpaire did look him in the face; for if againſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt ſentence of his Miſtris, he did oppoſe his innocency, then the ſuddain execution of it did appear in the eyes of his fancy. And as he was falling from one thought into another his hand fell a cidentally upon the Riband tyed to his arme, in which was <hi>Aſtreas</hi> Ring: Oh what horrid memorialls came then into his mind? Then did he fancy the fury which her ſoul expreſſed both by words and actions, when ſhe pronounced the ſentence of his baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Then after a long and ſad contemplation upon this laſt dyſaſter, he began to think upon the change of his Fortune; how happy he had been, and how ſhe favoured him. Then begun he to think what ſhe had done for him how for his ſake ſhe had ſlighted many well qualified ſhepherds how little ſhe valued the diſpleaſure of her Father, or anger of her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when they oppoſed againſt her affection: then began he to conſider, that Fortune is as fickle in matters of Love as in any thing elſe: and how few of all her favours remained with him, which was only a Bracelet of her hair tyed about his arme; and a Picture which he wore at his breſt, whoſe Caſe he kiſſed many a time: as for the Ring which he wore about the other arme he eſteemed that, rather as forced then of any benevolence. Then upon a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, he remembred the Letters which ſhe had writ unto him in the happie dayes of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in favour and which he alwayes carried about with him in a little bagg. Oh what rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was he in when he firſt thought upon them! for he feared leſt the Nymphes when they pulled off his cloathes ſhould have ſeen them. In this doubt he called out aloud for the little Merril: for he allwayes waited in a Lobby cloſe by. The little boy, hearing him call ſo haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two or three times, came to ſee what his pleaſure was. My little officer (ſaith <hi>Celadon)</hi> doeſt thou know what is become of my clothes? for they containe ſomthing which would much perplex me to loſe: Your clothes Sir, ſaid he, are not far from hence, but there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them, for I ſearched them. Oh <hi>Meril</hi> (ſaid the Shepheard) thou art much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for there was ſomething which I valued above my life; then turning towards the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the bed he began to make exceeding ſad complaints a long while together. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril</hi> hearing him, was on the one ſide very ſorry to heare him lament as he did; and on the other ſide was in great doubt whether he ſhould tell him all he knew: at laſt not being able to be longer a witneſſe of his ſorrowes; he told him that he needed not to trouble himſelfe ſo much for he was ſure the Nymph <hi>Galathea</hi> loved him too wel to keep from him any thing which he ſo much valued: At this, <hi>Celadon</hi> turned towards him, and asked whether
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53526:15"/>
that Nymph had them; I beleeve it is the ſame (ſaid he) at leaſt, I found a litle bundle of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and as I was bringing them unto you, ſhe met me and took them from me. Oh Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſaid the Shepheard, things are worſe and worſe, then turning on the otherſide, he would ſpeak no more. Mean time <hi>Galathea</hi> did read the Letters for it was true, ſhe did take them from <hi>Merill;</hi> and as thoſe in Love are alwayes full of curioſitie, ſo ſhe read them but ſhe had ſtrictly charged him to ſay nothing, becauſe ſhe intended to reſtore them, as unknown that ſhe had ſeen them. <hi>Silvia</hi> held the candle whilſt <hi>Galathea</hi> unlooſed the ſtring which tyed them together: we ſhall ſee (ſaid <hi>Silvia,)</hi> whether this Shepheard be ſuch a dull fellow as he would ſeeme to be and whether or no he be in Love: then <hi>Galathea</hi> took out the papers gently for feare of tearing them: and the firſt ſhe laid her hand upon, was this.</p>

               <p>How imperiouſly does this Shepherdeſs carry it, ſaid <hi>Galathea?</hi> She doth not injure him, (ſaid <hi>Silvia)</hi> ſince ſhe told him as much at the firſt. And truly if it be ſhe, whom I ſuppoſe it is, She is one of the faireſt and moſt admirably qualified perſons, that ever mine eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held: her name is <hi>Aſtrea:</hi> and that which induceth me to beleeve it is ſhe, is this word <hi>Phillis:</hi> for thoſe two Shepherdeſſes are intimate companions. And though, as I told you, her beauty be beyond al compariſons, yet it is the leaſt amiable quality in her for ſhe is ſo ful of ſeverall perfections, as her beauty is the leaſt conſiderable. This diſcourſe was but a wider opening of <hi>Galatheas</hi> wound, ſince ſtil greater difficulties appeared in the accompliſhment of her deſigne. And being unwilling to impart any more unto <hi>Silvia,</hi> ſhe tyed up the papers and went to bed not without a croud of various thoughts, which ſleep by degrees did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. As ſoon as the day dawned, litle <hi>Merill</hi> went out of the Shepherds chamber, who had done nothing but lament all the night long: and <hi>Galathea</hi> having commanded him to have a very ſtrict obſervance over all the actions of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and to make a report unto her, he went out to accquaint her with his obſervations: <hi>Galathea</hi> was awake, and talking aloud with <hi>Leonida,</hi> litle <hi>Merill</hi> knocked at the dore, and came in. Madam, ſaid he, not a wink of ſleep have I got all this night: for poor <hi>Celadon</hi> is even at deaths dore for want of thoſe papers you took from me yeſterday: and ſeeing him in ſuch lamentable deſpaire, I could not chuſe but comfort him a little, by telling him that you had them How? Replied the Nymph, knowes he that I have them? Yes Madam, ſaid <hi>Merill,</hi> and he told me that he would ask you for them, for he has a great eſteem of them: had you heard as I did, how he lamented the loſſe of them, it would have forced your heart to pitty him. Good <hi>Merill,</hi> ſaid the Nymph, tell me what he ſaid? Madam, replied he, after he had enquired whether I ſaw his papers, and I told him that you had them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he turned to the other ſide, as if diſtracted, and ſaid, Now are all things at the very worſt; and after a while ſilence, thinking me in bed and a ſleep, I heard him ſigh and ſay aloud. Oh <hi>Aſtrea, Aſtrea,</hi> muſt baniſhment be the recompence of all my faithfull ſervices? If thy affection be changed, why doſt thou blame me to excuſe thy ſelfe? If I have been faulty, why is not my fault made knowne unto me? Is there no Juſtice in Heaven, nor pitty in thy heart? If therebe, why do I find no favour from either? that I might either dy, or obey <hi>Aſtreas</hi> comwand. Oh moſt cruell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; if I ſhould die, would it not argue rather deficiency of Love, then exceſſe of courage? Then he pauſed a while and afterwards began again But whither would my flattering and truycerous hopes tranſport me? Dare ye once againe appear unto me? what ſhadow of any hope can poſſibly be, after ſo much time ſpent, after ſo many ſervices performed ſo much affection expreſſed; ſo many diſdaines endured, and many impoſſibilities vanquiſhed. Muſt abſence be the pittifull reward of all theſe? No, no, hope rather for a favour from a grave than from her. After much ſuch like diſcourſe, he was ſilent a long while; then turning himſelfe in bed, I heard him begin his lamentations, which continued untill day: and all were complaints againſt one <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> whom he accuſed of change, and cruelty. <hi>Galathea</hi> knew ſo much of <hi>Celadons</hi> eſtate, by <hi>Aſtreas</hi> Letters, and by <hi>Merills</hi> report, that it had been better for her, if ſhe had been more ignorant; yet flattering her ſelfe; ſhe imagined that <hi>Aſtrea's</hi> ſcorne might happily make the way more eaſie to accompliſh her deſires: But thoſe are Noviſts in the School of Love who know not, that Love never dies in a noble &amp; generous heart: and that the root of it, is never quite pulled up. Yet in this hope ſhe writ a note, and put it amongſt the Letters of <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> afterwards, giving the bundle to <hi>Merill,</hi> Here <hi>Merill</hi> ſaid flie, carry this bundle unto <hi>Celadon</hi> and tel him, that I wiſh I could as well render him all the contentments which he wants. If he be well and deſires to ſee me, tel him I am not wel this morning. She ſaid this, to the end, he might have the more leaſure to peruſe his papers,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53526:16"/>
and to read that which ſhe had writ. <hi>Merill</hi> he went away; and <hi>Leonida</hi> being in another bed ſhe did not ſee the bundle, nor hear the meſſage which <hi>Galathea</hi> ſent; but as ſoon as he was gone, ſhe called her into the ſame bed: then began thus to talke: You know <hi>Leonida,</hi> what diſcourſe we had yeſterday concerning this Shepherd; ſince that, I have met with more intelligence then I could have wiſhed; you heard what <hi>Merill</hi> ſaid, and what <hi>Silvia</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported concerning <hi>Aſtreas</hi> perfections; ſo as ſince the Fort is taken, I foreſee a double diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie in getting it againe: yet I find that this happy Shepheardeſſe hath much offended him, and a generous heart cannot brook a diſdain with out a reſent. Madam, anſwered <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onida,</hi> I could wiſh with all my heart, you could extinguiſh all theſe kind of thoughts: for if you continue in them, you will wrong your ſelfe exceedingly: do you think it poſſible to carry it alwaies ſecretly what a blame will it be unto your honour, if it ſhould be knowne? The whole courſe of your actions will be meaſured by it; what would you think of another that ſhould lead ſuch a life? You wil anſwer me perhaps, that you do no ill: Oh Madam, it is not enough for a perſon of your quality to be free from crime, but they muſt be alſo free from ſcandall. Were he a man worthy of you, I ſhould with ſome patience allow of it; but <hi>Celadon</hi> though he be the chiefe of the Country, yet he is a Shepherd, and not known for any more; and this vaine opinion of happy or unhappy can it ſo far bewitch you, and ſo degenerate your ſpirit as to equall ſheep-keepers, clownes and halfe-ſavages with your ſelfe. For Heavens ſake. Madam, conſider theſe things, and be your ſelfe, <hi>Leonida</hi> had continued on, if <hi>Galathea</hi> in a great rage had not interrupted her: I told you before, ſaid ſhe, that I wil not allow any more of ſuch moral doctrine: I am reſolved. When I ask your advice, ehen give it: mean time, no more of this diſcourſe, unleſſe you will incurre my diſpleaſure. Upon this, ſhe turned away to the other ſide of the bed in ſuch a fury, that <hi>Leonida</hi> knew ſhe had much diſpleaſed her. Nothing comes neerer the quick, then to object honour againſt Love; but the reaſons of Love will be predominate. A little after <hi>Galathea</hi> turn'd about, and told her, that ſhe did not, till now, ever think her ſo arrogant as to be her Governeſſe: Madam, anſwered ſhe, ſuch thoughts were never mine, I know my duty better then ſo: but ſince you take that ill, which I ſpoke, out of my affection to you, I ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after never give you any occaſion to be angry with me, for that cauſe. I wonder, replied <hi>Galathea,</hi> that your opinion ſhould be void of all reaſon can it ever be knowne that <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon</hi> is here? Only theſe are acquainted with it; we three, <hi>Meril,</hi> and my Nurſe his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: as for <hi>Merill</hi> he never goes out and beſides he is very diſcreet: as for my Nurſe her fidelitie is ſufficiently known; and beſides, the deſigne of all the whole buſineſſe hath its riſe from her: for ſhe reporting what the <hi>Druide</hi> foretold me, ſhe who Loves me, as if her own child, did adviſe me to ſleight the advice. I beſeech you Madam, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> what is your deſigne? To carry it ſo, anſwered ſhe, that this Shepheard may love me, and till then not to let him go from hence: and if I but get him once to love me, I will leave all the reſt to the conduct of fortune. Madam, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> Heavens ſwell all your deſires with full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: but I bſeeech you, give me leave to tell you only this once, that you will extreamly ſtaine your honour. It will be an age before his grounded affection to <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> will be rooted out: whoſe beautie and vertue has no ſecond. But <hi>Leonida,</hi> (anſwered <hi>Galathea) Aſtrea</hi> ſlights him, ſhe is offended at him, and ſhe hath baniſhed him: can you beleeve his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſo puſillanimous as to endure all this? Oh Madam, replied <hi>Leonida,</hi> extinguiſh ſuch vain hopes: if he have no courage at all, then he will never reſent theſe things: and if he have a noble ſpirit then let me tell you, that a generous minded man will never give over an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, becauſe he finds it full of difficulties: for example, remember your coorſe entertainment of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> how cruelly you have treated him, yet how little all thoſe diſdaines and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties do ſtartle him. But admit that <hi>Celadon</hi> who is a ſhepheard and whoſe courage cannot come in compare with <hi>Lindamors,</hi> admit I ſay that he ſhould fall off from <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> what hopes of any good can you conceive from thence? Do you think a man that's once deceived will ever be deceived a ſecond time by the ſame ſubject? No no Madam, he that is once burnt will not come neer the ſame fire again: perhaps (and herein is your moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous hopes) that time will cure him of his wound, and till then he will never ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject himſelfe to be wounded againe by another: how long that may be, Heavens know: mean time is it poſſible to keep the knowledge of it ſo long from the Guards in the Court? Either they will ſee him; for you cannot alwaies keep him mued up in your chamber, or elſe <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril,</hi> as diſcreet as he is, yet he is but a child &amp; may blab it out <hi>Leonida,</hi> ſaid ſhe, I charge you to ſpare your paines upon this ſubject: I am reſolved: &amp; if you will have me think you love me, advance my deſigne as much as you can: and leave the reſt to my care. If <hi>Celadon</hi> be recovered, you may carry him this morning into the Garden: for I find my ſelfe a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53526:17"/>
and ſhall ſcarce riſe out of bed till towards night: <hi>Leonida</hi> was very ſorry that no argument would prevaile and returned no anſwer: only this, that ſhe would contribute her beſt endeavours for her ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe two were thus diſcourſing, <hi>Merill</hi> did his office and delivered the meſſage: finding the ſhepherd awake, he bad him good morrow from the Nymph, and preſented the papers unto him. Oh how ready he was to riſe up and receive them? He cauſed the window and curtains to be opened in all haſte: he opened the bundle after ſeverall ceremonious kiſſes. Oh my dear papers, ſaid he, how have theſe ſtrange hands uſed you? then he ſorted them and laid them in order according to the time they were written, and finding another paper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, he opened it, and read theſe words.</p>
               <p>Celadon, <hi>I would have you know that</hi> Galathea <hi>Loves you: and that Heaven hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi> Aſtreas <hi>diſdaine, becauſe they would not have a ſhepherdeſſe any longer enjoy that which a Nymph deſires: acknowledge your happineſſe and do not ſleight it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Shepheard was all wonder; but ſeeing that little <hi>Merill</hi> kept an obſervant eye over all his actions, he would not ſuffer his wonder to be ſeene but tying up all the papers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and laying them in his bed, he asked, who gave them unto him? I took them out of my Ladies cloſet, (ſaid he) and had I not beene very deſirous to eaſe you of that paine in which I ſaw you were, I ſhould hardly have dared to have brought them: for my Lady is not very well. Who is with her (asked <hi>Celadon):</hi> the two Nymphes you ſaw yeſterday (ſaid he) the one is <hi>Leonida</hi> the Neece of <hi>Adamas;</hi> the other <hi>Silvia</hi> the Daughter of the glorious <hi>Deanta;</hi> and deſervedly his Daughter ſhe is; for ſhe is owner of the moſt ſtately Mine, that e're eye beheld.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Celadon</hi> came to the firſt notice of <hi>Galathea's</hi> affection to him. And he foreſaw that it would prove an addition of miſery unto him: therefore he prepared himſelfe for it. Now ſeeing halfe the day was already ſpent: and finding himſelfe very well, he would not any longer be a priſoner to his bed; conceiving that the ſooner he ſtirred abroad, the ſooner he might take his leave of the faire Nymphes Riſing therefore with that reſolution, as he was going out to walk, he met <hi>Leonida</hi> and <hi>Silvia,</hi> whom <hi>Galathea</hi> had ſent to beare him company; for ſhe her ſelfe would not riſe, nor be ſeene, being aſhamed of the Letter ſhe had written. They went into the Garden; and becauſe <hi>Caladon</hi> would conceale his ſorrowes, he conſtrained himſelfe into as blith an humour as he could; and ſeemed full of curioſitie to know every thing he ſaw. Fair Nymphes (ſaid he unto them) are we not neer the place where the Fountaine of verity in Love is? I do much deſire, if it may be, we may ſee our ſelves in it. Tis very neer (anſwered the Nymph) in yonder wood, but it is impoſſible to be ſeen for which you may thank that Lady who is the cauſe of it (ſaid ſhe, and pointed unto <hi>Silvia)</hi> I know no reaſon why you ſhould accuſe me (anſwered ſhe): for, ought the ſword be blamed if an imprudent man lay his hand upon it, and cut himſelfe? Tis very true (ſaid <hi>Leonida)</hi> but the perſon who wounds with it, is to be blamed, and beleeue it your beauty is ſuch as cannot be looked upon, without homicide: Be it what it will, (anſwered <hi>Silvia</hi> with a little bluſh) it hath cords ſtrong enough, never to let him go whom once it hath captivated. She ſaid this, as twitting her with the infidelitie of <hi>Agis,</hi> who once Loved her, and either out of jealouſie or ſome two monthes abſence, was quite changed: alſo upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her with <hi>Polemas,</hi> who was ſtolne from her by another beauty which <hi>Leonida</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood very well and thus replied; I muſt confeſſe Siſter, that my cords are eaſily untyed and the eaſier becauſe I would never take ſo much paines as to tye them faſter. <hi>Celadon</hi> heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto their pretty quarrells with much delight, and to the end, they ſhould not end too ſoon, he ſaid unto <hi>Silvia:</hi> fair Nymph, ſince it ſeemes you are the cauſe why this admirable Fountaine cannot be ſeen, I beſeech you oblige us ſo far, as to tell us, how it came to paſſe. <hi>Celadon,</hi> anſwered the Nymph and ſmiled, you have buſineſſe enough at home, and need not meddle much in that of others: but if your Love will allow of ſo much curioſitie, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onida</hi> if you requeſt her may perhaps tell you the end, as ſhe did undeſired, the beginning. Siſter anſwered <hi>Leonida,</hi> ſince you permit me, to tell the ſtory, I Love you ſo well, as I will not let your victories be unknowne, eſpecially thoſe which you ſo much deſire ſhould be knowne. But becauſe I will not tyre this ſhepherd I will be as brief as poſſible I can. Not for that reaſon, I beſeech you (ſaid the ſhepherd) but if you will, becauſe ſhe may have time enough to do the like office for you. Never doubt that (replied <hi>Silvia)</hi> but according as ſhe uſeth me, I ſhall know how to repay her: Thus from their own mouthes, <hi>Celadon</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:53526:17"/>
was acquainted with all the particulars of their lives: and to the end, he might the better hear as they walked, they placed him in the mindſt: and thus <hi>Leonida</hi> began.</p>

               <p>WHoſoever ſaith that Love is ſufficient to procure Love againe, never had any experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence either in the eyes or the courage of this Nymph for if they had, they would have known that as water runs from the fountaine, ſo the Love of ſuch as Love her, run away and never troubleth her. If when you have heard the diſcourſe I intend to make, you do not acknowledge as much, I will freely give you leave to taxe my judgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amaſis</hi> the mother of <hi>Galathea,</hi> hath a Son called <hi>Clidaman,</hi> owner of as many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent qualities, as any perſon of his age and ranke is capable of for he is exquiſite at any thing which relates either to Arms or Ladyes. About three years agoe, to give ſome teſtimonie of his gentle diſpoſition, and by the permiſion of <hi>Amaſis,</hi> he gave a ſervant unto all the Nymphs and this not by election, but lot: for having put the names of all the Nymphs into one baſin; and the names of all the young Caveliers into another, then in an open aſſembly, the baſin in which the Nymphs were, was preſented to the young Gallants: and the baſin in which the young Gallants were, was preſented unto the Nymphs. Then by the ſound of ſeveral trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets; the young <hi>Clidaman</hi> did draw his lot and it chanced to be <hi>Silvia</hi> afterwards the young Nymph did draw her lot, and it chanced to be <hi>Clidaman.</hi> Great were the applaudes which every one gave but the behaviour of <hi>Clidaman</hi> was moſt extolled who as ſoon as he had received his lot, went and kneeling down before this Nymph, did kiſs her fair hand She out of modeſty would not have ſuffered it without the command of <hi>Amaſis,</hi> who ſaid, it was the leaſt homage ſhe could receive. After her all the reſt took their chances: to ſome it happned according to their deſires, and to others, not. <hi>Galatheas</hi> fortune fel upon a brave Gallant called <hi>Lindamor,</hi> who then was newly returned from the armie: mine fell upon one, whoſe name was <hi>Agis,</hi> the moſt perfidious and unconſtant wethercock that ever was Some of theſe who took their fortunes did only in appearance like their chances: others did with their hearts ratifie what fortune had done: and thoſe who were moſt pleaſed with their chances, were ſuch as before that, had conceived ſome ſeeds of affection. Amongſt the reſt, young <hi>Ligdamon</hi> was one, whoſe lot light upon <hi>Silera;</hi> a Nymph truly very amiable, but not to him, who had already diſpoſed of his heart. And certainly it was happy for him that he was then abſent for he would never have performed that faigned homage which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſis</hi> would have commanded, &amp; that perhaps would have brought him into diſgrace. For you muſt know, that he was brought up amongſt us, and was ſo faire and handſome in all his actions, as every one eſteemed him; eſpecially <hi>Silvia,</hi> they being both of an age. At firſt their ordinary converſation begot a Love like unto that between Brothers and Siſters: ſuch a Love as their age was capable of; but as <hi>Ligdamon</hi> grew in years, ſo he did in affection, ſo as at fourteen or fifteen years of age, his wil began to change it ſelf into deſires; and his deſires, by degrees, became paſſions. Yet he carried the matter ſo diſcreetly, that <hi>Silvia</hi> her ſelfe had never knowne it, if ſhe had not forced him unto it. Afterwards when he knew his diſeaſe, and confidered what ſmal hopes there was of his cure, then the mirth and pleaſantneſſe which was wont to be in his lookes and all his actions, was turned into ſadneſſe, and from ſadneſſe into ſuch lumpiſh melancholy, that every one took notice of the alteration. <hi>Silvia</hi> was not the laſt of thoſe who asked him the reaſon; but ſhe could draw nothing from him but heartleſſe anſwers. At laſt when ſhe ſaw his dulneſſe continued, one day when ſhe was complaining againſt the coldneſſe of his affection, and obliging him to conceale nothing from her, ſhe perceived, that he could not ſo well conſtraine himſelfe, but that a ſad ſigh came out in lieu of an anſwer. This moved her to beleeve, that perhaps Love was the cauſe of his ill. Did not poor <hi>Ligdamon</hi> carry the matter very diſcretly all the while in all his actions, ſince ſhe could never imagine her ſelf to be the cauſe. Perhaps the Nymphes humour not liking the buſineſſe, was partly the cauſe; however his prudence was great that could conceal ſuch ardent affection. Now <hi>Silvia</hi> begins to urge him more then ſhe did before, and told him, that if Love was the cauſe ſhe would contribute all her aſſiſtance, and do all the good offices, he could deſire. The more he denied it, the more deſirous was ſhe to know it; at laſt, not being able to hold any longer, he confeſſed that it was Love: but ſaid that he had ſworn never to tell with whom. Tis moſt high preſumption, ſaid he to love her; but being compelled to it by ſuch an unreſiſtable beauty, I am the more excuſable: yet ſhould I name her, what excuſe could I find for my raſhneſſe? The ſame excuſe that your friendſhip

to me hath, ſaid <hi>Silvia.</hi> Then Madam; replied <hi>Ligdamor,</hi> that, and your command together, ſhall plead my excuse: do but look in that glaſſe, and you will ſee what you deſire to know. Upon this he took up a little glaſſe which ſhe wore, and held it before her eyes. You may imagine how ſhe was ſurpriſed at this: and ſhe hath ſince ſwore unto me, that ſhe verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved it to be <hi>Galathea</hi> whom he adored. Whilſt he ſtood amazed in contemplation of her, ſhe ſtood amazed at her own ſimplicity: ſhe was very angry with him, but more with her ſelfe, that ſhe ſhould be ſo ſimple as to force this manifeſto of Love from him. Yet all her haughty ſpirit would not permit her to condemne <hi>Ligdamor.</hi> but ſhe did riſe up upon a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and without a word went away full of rage, that any mortall durſt preſume to Love her. Proud beauty, that thinks none worthy of thee! Faithful <hi>Ligdamor</hi> ſtayes ſtill, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſoul, like an immoveable ſtatue. At laſt recollecting himſelfe, he got to his lodging as well as he could, out of which he ſtirred not a long time: for <hi>Silvias</hi> cold entertainment of his affection, did ſo pierce his heart, that he fell ſick; and when none hoped for any life, he writ this Letter unto her.</p>

               <p>This Letter was brought unto <hi>Silvia</hi> when ſhe was alone in her chamber; but I came in immediatly after, and indeed, happily for poor <hi>Ligdamor.</hi> For obſerve the humour of this Nymph; ſhe conceived ſuch a hatred againſt him ever ſince he diſcovered his affection to her, as their former friendſhip is not only out of mind: but ſhe hates him: and is ſo careleſſe of him, that when ſhe heares any, lamenting &amp; deſparing of his recovery, ſhe is no more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then if ſhe had never ſeen him. I who particularly took notice of it, did not know what to think unleſs that her youth might make her forget abſent perſons; but at this time, when I ſaw her refuſe the Letter which came from him, then I knew there was ſome fallings out betweene them. Therefore I took up the Letter which ſhe refuſed, and which the boy who brought it, had by his Maſters command left upon the table; <hi>Silvia,</hi> leſſe ſubtile then ſhe might have been, ran after me and deſired me not to read it. I am reſolved to ſee it (ſaid I) though for no other reaſon. but becauſe you forbid it. Then ſhe began to bluſh, and ſaid, deare ſiſter, do not read it, I beſeech you oblige me, and let it alone; I conjure you to it by our friendſhip: what can the buſineſſe be, (anſwered I) which you thus conceale from me? Beleeve it, <hi>Silvia,</hi> if you uſe any diſſimulations to hide your matters from me, it will fill me ſo full of curioſitie, as to diſcover you. Why ſiſter, (ſaid ſhe) may I not hope well in your diſcretion? No more, ſaid I, then I can in the ſinceritie of your affection.</p>
               <p>After a long wrangling about this Letter, I made her ſweare to tell me all upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſecrecy. Then ſhe told me, what I have told you concerning <hi>Ligdamor:</hi> and at this very hour, (ſaid ſhe) he troubles me with his Letters: but what have I to do with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, or rather diſſimulations? Nay, anſwered I, they are not diſſimulations, but truthes; Suppoſe they be, ſaid ſhe, what have I to do with his follies? You are obliged, anſwered I, to help ſuch miſerable men, as you have throwne downe a precipice. What helpe can I bring, ſaid ſhe? muſt I not live in the world? Why, is he where I am? Would you have me run away when he comes in preſence? Let him keep at home, and I ſhall never trouble him. All theſe excuſes, anſwered I, are of no validitie; for doubtleſſe you are an acceſſary, if not a principal, in his miſery: had you fewer perfections; were you leſſe amiable; did you not a uſe ſo much care in your dreſſe, beleeve it, he had never been brought to this extremity. Very good, ſaid ſhe and laughed: you are very pleaſant in charging me with theſe faults: what would you have me to be, if you would not have me to be what I am? Do you not know; <hi>Silvia,</hi> anſwered I that whoſoever ſharpens a ſword in a mad mans hand is culpable of all the harme he doth? That beauty which the heavens hath beſtowed upon you ſo liberally, hath
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53526:18"/>
had a ſharp edge ſet upon by you, ſo as no eye can look upon it without a wound; may not you be juſtly taxed with all the murders which your cruelty commits? <hi>Silvia</hi> you ought not to be ſo faire and full of perfections, unleſſe you ſtudie to make your ſelfe as good as you are fair, and get as much ſweetneſſe into your ſoul, as heavens have put into your face: but alas you are ſo farre from healing, that you are full of nothing but rigour and cruelty.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why I was ſo paſſionate in defence of <hi>Ligdamor,</hi> was beſides a relation of kindred, never any knew him but loved him, and I had heard, unto what a pittifull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he was brought. Then after much diſcourſe to this purpoſe, I opened the Letter and read it aloud, that ſhe might hear it. But it had no more operation upon her, than upon a ſtone, which I much wondred at, and perceived that I muſt uſe ſome violent reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which did induce me to tell her, that whatſoever came on it, I would not have <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor</hi> periſh. Well Siſter, ſaid ſhe, ſince you are ſo pittifull, I may cure him. It is not upon me, anſwered I, that his cure depends, but you; but I aſſure you, if you continue towards him as formerly you have, I ſhall ſpite you with a very notable diſpleaſure. For <hi>Amiſis</hi> ſhall know it and I will tell it to every one I meet. In ſhort, I Love <hi>Ligdamor,</hi> and will not ſee him dye, if I can hinder it. You ſay very well, <hi>Leonida,</hi> (ſaid ſhe in a fret) theſe are the good offices I ever expected from your friendſhip. My friendſhip, ſaid ſhe, ſhall be as much to you as him, and ſhall be for you againſt him if he were in the wrong. Here we made a long pauſe, and ſpoke not a word. At laſt I asked her what her reſolution was? What you will, ſaid ſhe, ſo you will not publiſh the follies of <hi>Ligdamor;</hi> for though I cannot be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any crime yet I ſhould be ſorry, the buſineſſe ſhould be divulged Oh <hi>Silvia,</hi> cryed I out this is an excellent humour; you are afraid it ſhould be known, that a man Loves you but you are not afraid to murder a man. Come, come looke a little better on <hi>Ligdamor</hi> give him as much hope, as may make him recover, then afterwards uſe him as you pleaſe, ſo you let him live<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Write two lines of a little comfort to him. I had much adoe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faine this favour from her, yet I ſtill did threaten to tell all, if ſhe did not; but after a long debate, ſhe writ thus unto him.</p>

               <p>This Letter came very opportunely: for when he had hardly ſo much ſtrength as to read it, he found a command from <hi>Silvia,</hi> to live: and when he was reſolved never to uſe any more remedies, yet in obedience to this Nymph, he ordered himſelfe ſo, as in a ſhort time he mended. But for all that, this fair peece of cruelty was ſtill as cold as ice towards him, when he was recovered: the moſt favorable anſwere he ever could obtaine from her was, I Love you not: neither do I hate you: let this ſatisfie you, that of all thoſe who ſerve me, you diſpleaſe me the leaſt. When either he or I made any addreſſes to her, ſhe gave us ſuch cruell language as is unimaginable by any but ſhe, and inſupportable to any but <hi>Ligdamor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to abbreviate this diſcourſe; <hi>Ligdamor</hi> loved her and courted her ever ſince with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other appearance of hope, but what I have told you; till <hi>Clidaman</hi> by Lot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>became her ſervant: And had he not known by me, that <hi>Clidaman</hi> fared no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then he in her affection, I know not what would have become of him. But though this did a little comfort him, yet the grandure of his rivall infuſed ſome fits of jealouſie I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when once I told him, that he need not fear <hi>Clidaman,</hi> he returned me this anſwer,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53526:19"/>
Fair Nymph, ſaid he, I will ingeniouſly tell you, from whence my jealouſie proceeds; and judge you whether or no I am in the right. I have had ſuch long experience of <hi>Silvia,</hi> as I muſt needs know, that fidelity of affection nor extremity of Love will never move her: ſo as doubtleſſe ſuch motives will never move her: yet as I have learned from the reverend <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> your Unckle, every one is ſubject unto ſome fatall ſtroke, which they cannot avoide when they are once touched by it: what can I imagine will ſubject this fair one, except it be grandure and power? Therefore I do fear, it is the fortune and not the merits of <hi>Clida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> will win her: his grandure and not his affection will carry her. But certainly, in this he was in the wrong, for neither the Love of <hi>Ligdamor,</hi> nor the grandure of <hi>Clidaman,</hi> could ever move the leaſt ſpark of goodwill in <hi>Silvia.</hi> I beleeve. Love reſerves her for an example unto others, intending to puniſh ſo much diſdaine by ſome unaccuſtomed way. At this time, there chanced a very notable teſtimonie of her beauty; or at leaſt, the power ſhe had to make her ſelfe loved. Upon that Feſtivall, which every yeare was celebrated the ſixth day of the Moon in July on which <hi>Amaſis</hi> was wont to offer a ſolemne ſacrifice, as well by reaſon of the feaſt, as becauſe it was the birth day of <hi>Galathea,</hi> in the midſt of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice there came into the Temple, a number of men in the morning; amongſt them was one ſo full of noble Majeſty as it was eaſy to imagine that he was Maſter to the reſt. He was ſo ſad and melancholy, as it was evident ſomthing did much afflict his ſoul. His habit was deep black trayling upon the ground, which did eclipſe the handſomeneſſe of his proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: his head was bare; his hair fair and curling, as bright as Sun beames, which attracted the eyes of every one upon him. He came up as farre as the loweſt ſtep of the Throne, where <hi>Amaſis</hi> did ſit; and after an humble reverence, he retired again waiting untill the ſacrifice was ended: and whether to his good or bad fortune I know not, he ſeated himſelfe directly oppoſite unto <hi>Silvia.</hi> He no ſooner caſt his eyes upon her but he knew her though he had never ſeen her before: but for more ſuerty, he asked one of his ſervants who knew us all, who anſwered only with a deep ſigh: Afterwards as long as the ceromony laſted, he never took his eyes off her. At laſt the ſacrifice being ended, <hi>Amaſis</hi> returned to her Palace, where when audience was permitted, him he ſpake thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>MADAM,</hi> Though the mourning you ſee in my habit, be much blacker in my ſoul; yet it cannot equall the cauſe; but though my loſſe be extreame, yet I do not thinke I am the only loſer; for you Madam, from amongſt your faithfull ſervants, are leſſed of one, who perhaps was not the leaſt affectionate nor the moſt unprofitable in your ſervice. This conſideration gave me ſome hopes, of obtaining a revenge of his death againſt the homicide: but as ſoon as ever I entred into the Temple, I loſt all my hopes, thinking that if the deſire of revenge did die in me, who am a Brother to the injured, it would ſooner die in you Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, who have leſſe relation to him. Yet becauſe I ſee the armes of my Brothers murderer already prepared againſt me, I ſhall as briefly as poſſible, tell you the Fortune of him whom I mourn for.</p>
               <p>Though Madam I never had the honour to be known unto you yet I am confident, that at the name of my Brother, who never lived but in your ſervice, you will liſt me in the catalogue of your moſt devoted ſervants. His name was <hi>Ariſtander,</hi> both of us Sonnes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the great <hi>Clemir,</hi> who in your ſervice did ſo often viſit <hi>Tiber, Reine,</hi> and <hi>Danube:</hi> I being the younger by nine yeares, as ſoon as he ſaw me capable of bearing armes, he ſent me into the Armie of the great <hi>Merovea,</hi> the delight of men, the moſt pleaſing Prince, that ever came in <hi>Gaule.</hi> I cannot well tell you why he rather ſent me to <hi>Merovea,</hi> then to <hi>Thierry</hi> King of the <hi>Viſigots</hi> or to the King of the <hi>Burgundians.</hi> Yet I conceave his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was becauſe I ſhould not ſerve a Prince ſo neer your Dominions, whom Fortune might make your enemy. My fate was this; that <hi>Childerick</hi> his Son, a warlike Prince and of great hopes, ſeeing me ſutable with him in age, did moſt particularly favour me with his affection, more then any other: when I came firſt to him, it was then when the great and prudent <hi>Aetius</hi> did treat an agreement with <hi>Merovea</hi> and the <hi>Frankes</hi> (for ſo he called all thoſe who followed him) to reſiſt that fatall ſcourge of Heaven, <hi>Attilla</hi> King of the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> who having gathered together in the deſerts of <hi>Aſia</hi> an uncredible number of men, even five hundred thouſand combatants, he deſcended like a <hi>Torrent,</hi> moſt furiouſly ravaging all Countries through which he marched and though this <hi>Aetius,</hi> the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General of <hi>Valentinian</hi> in <hi>Gaule,</hi> came with an intention of making war upon <hi>Mero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vea,</hi> who during the Government of <hi>Caſtinus</hi> had ſeiſed upon part of <hi>Gaule;</hi> yet he thought it better to make him, the <hi>Viſigots,</hi> and <hi>Burgundians</hi> alſo his freinds, rather then hazard a defeat by <hi>Attillaſ,</hi> who having already paſſed <hi>Germany,</hi> was upon the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53526:19"/>
banks of <hi>Rheyne</hi> where he ſtayed not a long time, before he advanced into <hi>Gaule,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiged the Towne of <hi>Orleans,</hi> till the comming of <hi>Thierry</hi> King of the <hi>Viſigotts,</hi> made him raiſe Seige, and take another way. But being met with by <hi>Merovea</hi> and <hi>Aetius</hi> with their confederates in the <hi>Cathalaunique</hi> fields, he was defeated, more by the valour of the <hi>Franks</hi> and prudence of <hi>Merovea,</hi> then any other force. After <hi>Aetius</hi> was ſlaine, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps by his Maſters command, upon ſome diſcontent, <hi>Merovea</hi> was received at <hi>Paris, Orleans,</hi> and the neighbouring Townes, as their Lord and King: and all the people ever ſince, have borne him ſo much affection, as they called themſelves <hi>Franks,</hi> as more pleaſing unto him: and their Country in lieu of <hi>Gaule,</hi> took the name of <hi>France.</hi> Whilſt I was imployed in the armes of <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Gaules,</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> the <hi>Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotts</hi> and the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> my Brother was imployed in the Armes of Love; Armes the more dangerous becauſe all wounds light upon the heart: ſuch was his diſaſter, that being brought up with <hi>Clidema,</hi> he ſaw the fair <hi>Silvia:</hi> and in ſeeing her he ſaw his death alſo, for he never was himſelfe ſince. I never knew the cauſe of this; for being with <hi>Childericke,</hi> I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed all imaginable content, as being very gracious which my Maſter, loved amongſt all my equals, and generally honoured of all, out of a good opinion which they conceived of me in the preſent affaires; which got me more credit and authoritie over them, then perhaps my age did merit: but hearing of my Brothers languiſhing condition, I could not ſtay any longer with <hi>Childericke;</hi> but taking my leave of him, and promiſing to returne ere long, I haſted to the place where my affection invited me: as ſoone as I came there, many did run to tell my Brother that <hi>Guyamant</hi> was come: for ſo I am called: when he heard it, his Love to me did give him ſo much feeble ſtrength as to riſe up in his bed, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace me with abundance of affection. It is to no purpoſe, to trouble you Madam, and grieve my ſelfe, with a relation of all particulars that paſſed betwixt us; only this, within two or three dayes after, my Brother was in ſuch extremity that he had hardly ſtrength enough to breathe: all he had was only ſighes and groanes, and nothing underſtood to come from him but the name of <hi>Silvia.</hi> I being extreamly perplexed at my Brothers ſad conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was ſuch an enemy unto this unknown <hi>Silvia,</hi> as I could not chuſe but curſe her: which my brother hearing, and his affection to her being above his malady; he forced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſay thus: unleſſe Brother you will become my enemy, ceaſe theſe imprecations, I beſeech you, which ttouble me more then all my miſery beſides. What will they profit you further then to teſtifie, that you hate what I do Love? I know my death will grieve you; but ſince all men are deſigned to the ſame, why rather do you not with me thank the fates who have choſen ſo good a death for me, and the faireſt murderer that ever any had? The abundance of my affection, and the abundance of <hi>Silvias</hi> vertues, are the armes which her beauty made uſe of, to bring me unto my grave: Can you curſe her, whoſe happineſſe I prefer before my own ſoul's? he would have ſaid more but his ſtrength failed him: I anſwer'd him thus. Brother, ſhe who thus will raviſh you from us, is the moſt unjuſt perſon that ever was: If ſhe be fair, the gods themſelves are guilty of injuſtice in making her ſo, for they ſhould have changed either her face or her heart. <hi>Ariſtander</hi> hearing this, aſſumed more ſtrength and replied: for Heavens ſake <hi>Guyamant,</hi> give over your blaſphemy, and beleeve that <hi>Silvias</hi> heart is ſutable to her face. As the one is all beauty, ſo the other is all vertue: if I die for Loving her, never wonder at it. As no eye is able to gaze upon the Sun, ſo my ſoul is dazled at the rayes of ſo many Suns as ſhine in this beauty: it is impoſſible to gaze upon ſo many Divinities and live. Then ſaid I unto him, Is it poſſible Brother; that one ſingle Divinity ſhould be the cauſe of your death? Brother, anſwered he, I am in ſuch extremity as I am not able to anſwer your demand; but Brother (continued he, and took me by the hand) I conjure you, by all that's ſacred, to promiſe me one thing: carry this kiſſe from me to <hi>Silvia,</hi> and then he kiſſed my hand: and when you ſee that Nymph, tell her I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath you unto her: at this word he expired, and lay cold in my armes.</p>
               <p>My reſentments of this loſſe is unimaginable by any but my ſelfe: but without more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doling this diſaſter, let me tell you Madam, that as ſoon as my ſorrow would permit me, I came to render unto you the homage which is due, and to demand Juſtice for the death of <hi>Ariſtander:</hi> alſo to preſent unto her, what he left her by his laſt will in writing. But as ſoone as I preſented my ſelf before you and would have accuſed the murderer, I found my Brothers words to be true, and do not only excuſe his death, but deſire and require the ſame.</p>
               <p>Here Madam, by your permiſſion, will I make my addreſſe Then making an humble reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto <hi>Amaſis,</hi> he choſe out <hi>Silvia,</hi> and kneeling unto her thus ſaid: Fair murderer, if
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53526:20"/>
but one poor tear of pitty do but drop into that fair boſome at the news of his death whom you conquered, your victory will be noble, and entire; but if you think ſo little water too much for thoſe flames which you kindled in him, then at leaſt receive a zealous kiſs which he hath ſent you, or rather his ſoul changed into this kiſs, which he preſents unto you. Upon this he kiſſed her hand, and did riſe up: then thus continued. Amongſt the papers where <hi>Ariſtander</hi> had left his laſt will we found this; and becauſe it was ſealed and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you, I have brought it with a proteſtation which by his teſtament he commanded me to make unto you before you open it, that if it be not your pleaſure, to grant the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt which he makes, then he beſeeched you not to read it, to the end in his death, as in his life, he may not reſent your cruelty: then he preſented unto her a Letter, which <hi>Silvia</hi> had refuſed but for the command of <hi>Amaſis.</hi> I have hitherto, ſaid <hi>Guyamant,</hi> fullfilled the laſt will of <hi>Ariſtander:</hi> it remaines that I proſecute againſt the murderer: but as heretofore I have been obedient to my Brothers commands, ſo Love now commands me to ſacrifice my own liberty upon the ſame Altar which yet reekes with my Brothers blood, who when he lived told me, that all eyes which ever looked upon you did owe their hearts unto you as a juſt tribute; and that thoſe men were unworthy to live, which did not live in your ſervice. <hi>Silvia</hi> a little aſhamed at this encounter, ſtood mute a long while and gave no anſwer: ſo that <hi>Amaſis</hi> took the Letter, and telling <hi>Guyamant</hi> that <hi>Silvia</hi> ſhould returne him an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſhe took her aſide, and breaking open the ſeale, ſhe read theſe words.</p>

                  <hi>Amaſis</hi> calling <hi>Silvia</hi> to her, asked her what kind of ſtrange cruelties ſhe had uſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Ariſtander,</hi> which had brought him to this extremitie? The Nymph with a bluſh anſwered, that ſhe knew not wherein ſhe had done him any wrong. I would have you, ſaid ſhe, entertain <hi>Guyamant</hi> in his room. Then calling both before her, ſhe asked him whether he would follow his Brothers inclination: He anſwered, yes with all his heart. Then ſaid <hi>Amaſis,</hi> I ſhell entreat this Nymph, to admit you to his place and to uſe you, better then ſhe did him. <hi>Guyamant,</hi> after a very humble reverence unto <hi>Amaſis,</hi> offered to kiſs the hand of <hi>Silvia,</hi> in ſigne of ſervitude: but ſhe ſo ſlighted the declaration of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that unleſſe <hi>Amaſis</hi> had commanded her, ſhe would never have looked upon him.</p>
               <p>When every one began to retire, <hi>Clidaman</hi> returned from hunting, and was told of this new ſervant unto his Miſtris. Againſt which he made ſuch loud complaints, that <hi>Amaſis</hi> and <hi>Guyamant</hi> did hear them: and ſince he could not imagine how this ſhould come about, ſhe told him the whole buſineſſe. When ſhe had done <hi>Clidaman</hi> complained more then before that ſhe ſhould ſuffer a thing ſo much to his diſadvantage, and told her that ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the decree of Fate which his lot had given him, and which none ſhould ever raviſh from him and live. This language proceeded from a heart full of affection, and was utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a bundance of vehemency, for he did Love <hi>Silvia</hi> extreamly. <hi>Guyamant,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the edge which his new Love had put upon him, had ſo good an opinion of himſelfe as not to yeild unto any', returned an anſwer, addreſſing his ſpeech unto <hi>Amaſis.</hi> Madam, ſaid he, it ſeemes ſome would not have me to be a ſervant unto the fair <hi>Silvia:</hi> but ſuch are ignorant what Love is, otherwiſe they would never think, that your ordinances, or the ordinances of all the gods together, have power enough to divert the courſe of affection: And therefore I do openly declare, that if any ſhall offer to forbid me that which is already permitted me, I ſhall diſobey and rebell: It is neither duty nor any other conſideration can make me change. Then turning towards <hi>Clidaman:</hi> as for you, Sir, I know what reſpects I
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53526:20"/>
owe you, but withall, I know what power Love hath over me: as the deſtinies did give <hi>Silvia</hi> unto you, ſo her beauty did give me unto her: Judge you whether of theſe gifts ought to be moſt pleaſing unto her. <hi>Clidaman</hi> would have replyed, but <hi>Amaſis</hi> interiupted him. Sonne, ſaid ſhe, you have no reaſon to complaine, unleſſe our ordinances were altred: you were commanded to ſerve <hi>Silvia,</hi> but others were not forbidden to do the ſame. Smells are moſt odoriferous, when ſtirred; and a Lover having Rivals has more teſtimonie's of his merit. Thus <hi>Amaſis,</hi> ordained that both of them ſhould ſerve her. And thus is <hi>Silvia</hi> well ſtored of ſervants, for <hi>Guyamant</hi> dreſſed up his affection in the beſt trim, and <hi>Clida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in envie of him, did ſtudie how to outvie him in courtſhip. <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> he ſerved her with ſo much diſcretion and reſpect, that, leaſt others ſhould take notice of his affection, he durſt ſeldome come neer her: and in my opinion his courtſhip was much more pleaſing then any of the reſt; but once, beleeve it, he was almoſt paſt all his patience. It hapned that <hi>Amaſis</hi> had a bodkin in her hand, which was made in the faſhion of a ſword, and which <hi>Silvia</hi> was wont to wear in her hair; and <hi>Clidaman</hi> being neer her, ſhe gave it unto him to carry unto his Miſtris: but he kept it all the day, purpoſely to vex <hi>Guyamant,</hi> never ſo much as dreaming upon <hi>Ligdamon:</hi> but ſee how one may wound one for another: the poyſon which was prepared for <hi>Guyamant,</hi> did ſo neerly reach the heart of <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> that not being able to diſſemble he retired to his lodging, where after he had a while ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomed himſelfe by his own thoughts, he took pen and writ theſe verſes.</p>

                  <hi>I cannot chuſe, fair</hi> Leonida, <hi>but reſemble</hi> Silvia <hi>to the Sun; which indifferently doth ſhine upon the moſt vile things as well as upon the moſt Noble.</hi>

               <p>He himſelf brought me this coppie: I read it; but though I ſtudied, yet for my life I could not underſtand it: nordraw any thing from it, unleſſe that <hi>Silvia</hi> had given him a great blow with a ſword, but he left me and went away the moſt loſt and undone man alive. Thus you ſee what a cunning cutter Love is, who with ſuch trifling Armes, can make ſuch deep wounds. He vexed me to ſee him in this condition, and to enquire further of things I went unto <hi>Silvia;</hi> but ſhe proteſted that ſhe knew not what they meant. At laſt after a reading of theſe verſes two or three times, ſhe lifted up her hand to her head, &amp; finding her bodkin not there, ſhe begun to laugh and ſay her bodkin was loſt, that ſome or other had found it, and that <hi>Ligdamon</hi> knew of it: She had no ſooner ſaid ſo, but <hi>Clidaman</hi> came into the Hall with this murdering ſword in his hand. I intreated her to let him have it no longer: I will firſt try his diſcretion, ſaid ſhe, afterwards, I will uſe all the power I have with him. She was as good as her word, for as ſoone as he came, ſhe ſaid unto him. This ſword is mine. He anſwered, ſo Madam is he that hath it. I would have it, ſaid ſhe. I wiſh with all my ſoul ſaid he, you would have all thats yours. Will you not reſtore it (ſaid the Nymph) how

You Madam have raviſhed it from me (ſaid he) and at this very minute it is changed into yours. Since it is ſo (ſaid ſhe) that your will is mine, you muſt reſtore the bodkin, becauſe my will is ſo. Since I would the ſome that you would (ſaid he) it muſt of neceſſity follow that I would have it alſo. <hi>Silvia</hi> ſmiled a little, but at laſt ſhe ſaid, I would have you give it me. I alſo, ſaid he, would have you give it me. Then the Nymph put out her hand and took it. I will never deny you (ſaid he) though you would have me and all. Thus <hi>Silvia</hi> receaved her ſword, and I writ this Note unto <hi>Ligdamon.</hi>

               <p>Thus was <hi>Ligdamon</hi> cured, not by the ſame hand, but by the ſame ſword which woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him. In the meane time, <hi>Guyamants</hi> affection grew to this height, as it was little ſhort of <hi>Ariſtanders.</hi> On the other ſide, <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> under the colour of Complement, did ſuffer a moſt paſſion at Love, to plant it ſelfe in his ſoul. After that both of them had vyed which ſhould moſt pleaſe <hi>Silvia,</hi> and found that ſhe did equally favour and frown upon them both, they reſolved one day to try which of them was moſt in favour, and to that end, they both came to <hi>Silvia,</hi> from whom they both received ſuch cold anſweres, that the controverſie could not be decided. Then by the counſel of a Druide who was grieved to ſeetwoſuch men, unprofitably loſe that time which might better be ſpent in defence of their countryes, they went unto the Fountain of the veritie of Love. You know, what the property of that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is, and how it diſcovers the moſt ſecret thoughts of Lovers: for he who lookes into it, ſhall there ſee his Miſtris, and if ſhe Love him he ſhall ſee himſelfe by her: but if ſhe Love another, then that other ſhall appear. <hi>Clidaman</hi> was the firſt which preſented himſelfe before this Fountain: he kneeled downe upon the ground; kiſſed the ſide of the Fountain; and after he had implored the Angell of the place to be favorable unto him, he leaned a little over: immediatly <hi>Silvia</hi> was ſeen, ſo admirably fair, that the tranſported Lover could not chuſe but ſtoope to kiſſe her hand: but his contentment was ſoone cooled when he ſaw no body by her. He retired with a perplexed mind, and after a diſcontented pauſe, he beckned unto <hi>Guyamant</hi> to come and try his fortune. He, having with all requiſite cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies prayed unto the Dietie of the place, did caſt his eye upon the Fountain, but he fared no better then <hi>Clidaman;</hi> for <hi>Silvia</hi> alone appeared, and with her fair eyes ſeemed to burn the water. Both of them much amazed at the matter, they went to a Druide who was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly verſed in Magique and asked the cauſe. He anſwered, that the reaſon was becauſe <hi>Silvia</hi> loved neither of them, nor any elſe, as being capable of burning others but not of burning, herſelfe. They who could not beleeve themſelves to be ſo much out of favour, as they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeverally before, ſo now they would returne and looke in the water both together: and though both of them leand over on ſeverall ſides, yet the Nymph appeared alone. The Druide ſaw them retire, and ſmiled, telling them that they might certainly beleeve themſelves not loved for ſaid he, you muſt know that as all other waters do repreſent the body, this repreſents the ſpirits. Now the ſpirit, which is only the will, the memorie, and the judgment, when it loves, is transformed into the thing loved. And therefore when you preſent your ſelfe here, it receives the figure of your ſpirit, and not of your body, and your ſpirit being changed into <hi>Silvia,</hi> it repreſents <hi>Silvia,</hi> and not you. If <hi>Silvia</hi> loved you, ſhe would have been changed as well into you, as you into her, and ſo repreſenting your ſpirit you ſhould ſee <hi>Silvia,</hi> and ſeeing <hi>Silvia</hi> changed by Love, as I told you, you ſhould ſee your ſelves alſo. <hi>Clidaman</hi> liſtned very attentively unto this diſcourſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the concluſion was an aſſurance of that which he moſt feared, he drew his ſword and ſtruck two or three times as hard as he could upon the Marble of the Fountain. His ſword broke in two, and left no impreſſion, or ſigns of his blows but ſtill ſtriving to break the ſtone, like an angry dogge, which bites the ſtone which is thrown at him, the Druide told him that he loſt his labour, for the inchantment of the place would never end

by force, but by extremity of love but if he would make it uſeleſſe, he could inform him of a way. <hi>Clidaman</hi> had brought up for rarity in great Iron Cages, two Lyons, and two Unicornes, which he often baited with ſeverall ſorts of Animals: Theſe the Druide beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for guards of the Fountain, and ſo enchanted them, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, though they ranne at libertie, yet they would never go <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rom the entrance into the grate, nor will they ever offer any hurt, unleſſe to ſuch as will attempt upon the Fountain; but ſuch as will be ſo adventurous, they aſſault with extream fury; for, the Lions are ſo great and terrible, their Clawes ſo long and ſharp, they are ſo nimble and active, and ſo unimated unto this defence, as is incredible. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the Unicomes have Hornes ſo ſharp and ſtrong, as they will pierce the hardeſt Rock, and do thruſt with ſuch force and nimbleneſſe as none can eſcape them. Aſſoon as this guard was placed, <hi>Clidaman</hi> and <hi>Guyamant</hi> went to travell, and departed ſo ſecretly, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Amaſis</hi> nor <hi>Silvia</hi> knew of it, untill they were gotten a great way from them. They went into <hi>Merovea</hi> and <hi>Childerick;</hi> for, finding themſelves equally treated by Love, they would try whether Armes alſo would be equally favourable unto them. Thus, courteous ſhepheard, have we loſt the benefit of this Fountain, which did ſo well diſcover all Juglers in love, as if all had been like <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> it had never been loſt. When I heard that <hi>Clidaman</hi> and <hi>Guyamans</hi> intended to go thither, I adviſed him to make a third, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring my ſelfe, that he would finde moſt favour; but, he made me this anſwer, Fair <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onida,</hi> ſaid he, ſuch as are in doubt of their good or bad Fate, may ſometimes hatard the enquitie; but, it were moſt groſſe folly for ſuch, as have not the leaſt ſpark of any hope, to ſearch for that, which they would moſt unwillingly finde. For my part, I am in no doubt whether <hi>Silvia</hi> do love me or no; alas, I am too well aſſured of it: And when I deſire to know more, I will never make enquirie of any, but her eyes and actions. However, his love was ſtill the ſame, and Heavens knowes, how cruelly this rigorous piece of Crueltie it ſelfe hath ever uſed him: the time's to come, when ever ſhe looked upon him without diſdam and ſeveritie. For my part, I wondered at his patience, for all her actions towards him, are rather injuries then ſeverities.</p>
               <p>One day when he met her walking with me, I intreated him to ſing; and having an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent voice, he ſung theſe lines.</p>

own vain deſires, and indeed, it is they only which torment you. The paſſionate <hi>Ligda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> anſwered, That it was true indeed; it was deſire which tormented him; but, it was not that which ought to be blamed: it was that which cauſed it, which was the vertues and perfections of <hi>Silvia.</hi> If deſires, replyed ſhe, be not irregular and extravagant, they will not torment; but if they be ſo unruly, as to tranſport beyond reaſon, then they muſt needs be but Baſtards and not the legitimate children of vertue, and are ſo unlike ſuch a mother, that they do nothing reſemble her. All extream deſires, Madam, (anſwered <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damon)</hi> are not againſt reaſon and vertue; for all excellencies and goodneſſe, may with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be extreamly deſired; Beauty, amongſt other excellencies, may, with reaſon, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly and paſſionately loved: for, it cannot be ſaid to be againſt reaſon, but above it. This is a very nice diſtinction, (replyed this cruell fair one) and I will never allow of any thing, either againſt or above reaſon. Then, to take away the opportunity of reply, ſhe went away unto one of her Companions which followed. Upon a time, when <hi>Amaſis</hi> returned from Mount <hi>Briſon,</hi> where the fineneſſe of the Gardens, and ſolitude together, had ſtayed her longer then ſhe intended, night did ſurprize us in our return to <hi>Marcelles;</hi> and the night being very cold, I went unto him, purpoſely to make him talk before his Miſtreſſe, and asked him, if he were not very ſenſible of the chill evening? To which he anſwered, that neither heat nor cold could do him much hurt: And asking him why, and what antidote he had againſt it? he anſwered, that to the one he oppoſed his burning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and to the other his cold hopes. If it be ſo, replyed I, how comes it to paſſe I ſhould ſo often hear you ſay, that ſometimes you burn with heat, and ſometimes freeze with cold? Ah! fair Nymph, anſwered he with a deep ſigh, my diſeaſe is not out wardly, but all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and that ſo deep, that there is not a corner of my ſoul, but ſadly reſents it. And you muſt know, that in any other perſon, heat and cold are inconſiſtent together: But I have in my heart a flaming fire, and alſo chill ice, and I only, the gods do know, do feel the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Silvia</hi> all this while was ſilent, and uſed none of her accuſtomed cruelties; but at laſt, ſeeing him turn towards me, and ſigh, ſhe alſo turned, and in a merry manner, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull, thus ſhe ſaid: Oh! what a happy man is <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> that can command both heat and cold when he pleaſeth? or, at leaſt, neither of them ever troubles him; for, if the coldneſſe of his hopes do freeze, his hot deſires can cauſe a thaw; and, if his hot deſires do burn him, he can freeze them up with a few cold hopes. It is but neceſſarie, faire <hi>Silvia,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Ligdamon)</hi> that I ſhould uſe theſe remedies to keep me alive; otherwiſe, I ſhould live but a little; but alaſſe, the Gods do know they are but poor comforts. Nay, nay replyed the Nymph, you can make your diſeaſe juſt as you would have it, either hot or cold. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Madam, anſwered <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> to ſcorch and freez both at once, is none of the leaſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which proceed from you; but, the greater wonder is, that my heat ſhould proceed out of your ice, and your ice proceed out of my heat. Nay <hi>Ligdamon</hi> replyed the Nymph, the greateſt wonder of all is, that a man, who has the reputation of rationall, ſhould have ſuch idle imaginations, and think ſuch impoſſibilities, as whoſoever ſhould credit them, may be taxed with want of as much judgment, as you of wit or truth. I do confeſſe, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid he, that my imagination does conceive many impoſſibilities; but, the cauſe of it is, either my too much affection, or your too much cruelty, or both. And as this is not one of your I aſt effects, ſo this, wherewith you upbraid me, is not one of my leaſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I believe, anſwered ſhe, that your torments and my effects lie moſt in your tongue. 'Tis very hard, Madam, for the tongue to expreſſe well, that which is not well reſented, anſwered <hi>Ligdamon.</hi> 'Tis very hard, replyed the Nymph, to underſtand all the vain Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as of an idle and a brain-ſick fancy. If truth, ſaid <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> did not accompany this imagination, then ſhould I ſtand leſſe in need of your compaſſion. No, no, anſwered the Nymph, men do build their trophees too much over the compaſſion of us women. Had it not been better ſaid, Madam, anſwered he, That women do build their Trophees too much over our ruines? I never ſaw any yet ſo ruined, replyed <hi>Silvia,</hi> but like you, they will quickly recover.</p>
               <p>The more of this Nymphs cruelties, and <hi>Ligdamon's</hi> patiences, I do relate, the faſter they come into my memorie. When <hi>Clidaman,</hi> as I told you before, was to travell, <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> would have the greateſt part of the young Gallantry in this Country, to go along with him under the conduct of <hi>Lindamour:</hi> amongſt the reſt <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> being a moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed Caveliere, he was not omitted: But this cruel Miſtriſſe would not ſo much as daigne him an Adien; but faigned her ſelfe ſick. Yet he would by ſome meants or other firſt let her know of it, and thereup on writ theſe verſes unto me.</p>

                  <hi>Galathea,</hi> who in good earneſt was in love, as long as <hi>Celadon</hi>'s ſickneſſe laſted, ſhe ſcareely ſtirred from his bed; and when ſhe was conſtrained to go away, either to reſt her ſelf, or do any other buſineſſe, ſhe left <hi>Leonida</hi> with him, and charged her to take all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, of letting the ſhepheard know her good-will towards him; thinking by this means to infuſe ſuch hopes in him, as his qualitie might perhaps forbid him: And certainly <hi>Leonida</hi> did not fail her; for, though ſhe wiſhed with all her heart, that <hi>Lindamor</hi> might thrive in his deſires; yet, ſince the hopes of her advancement depended wholly upon <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea,</hi> her deſigne was wholly to pleaſe and comply with her. But Love, which often uſeth to make himſelfe merry at the prudence of Lovers, and is pleaſed to thwart their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, did make <hi>Leonida,</hi> by the converſation of this ſhepheard, to ſtand more in need of one to ſpeak for her, then ſhe to ſpeak for another. The ſhepheard quickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it: But his affection to <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> for all her harſhneſſe, would not permit him to ſuffer this growing affection with patience. This was the reaſon that he reſolved to take his leave of <hi>Galathea,</hi> aſſoon as he began to be a little better.</p>
               <p>But aſſoon as ever he mentioned any ſuch offer: How <hi>Celadon?</hi> (ſaid ſhe unto him) has your entertainment by me been ſo bad, that you would be gone before you be recovered? And when he anſwered, That it was, becauſe he was troubleſome to her, &amp; becauſe of ſome buſineſſe of her own, alſo to aſſure his Parents and friends of his health; and therefore he deſired to return home unto his own Village; Then ſhe interrupted him, ſaying, No, no, <hi>Celadon,</hi> never fear any troubling of me; and as for your buſineſſe and friends, it is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; me thinks your greateſt buſineſſe ſhould be, to ſatisfie your obligations unto me; and it will be high ingratitude in you, not to ſpend each minute of that life which you hold of me, in my ſervice; beſides, you muſt not for the time to come, caſt your eyes upon ſo low a thing as your life paſt: You muſt leave your Village and your Flocks to ſuch as want thoſe merits which you have; and for the future, look upon me, who can and will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence you, to the height, if your actions do not take away my good-will unto you.</p>
               <p>Though the ſhepheard ſeemed, as if he did not underſtand the meaning of this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, yet he did; and therefore he avoided talking with her in private as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he could; and he did ſo much diſguſt this kinde of life, that being one day almoſt out of all patience, when <hi>Leonida</hi> heard him ſigh, ſhe asked him the reaſon, ſince he was in a place, where nothing was more ſtudied then his contentment? Fair Nymph, anſwered he, amongſt all the miſerable wretches of Fortune, I may profeſſe my ſelfe the moſt coorſly treated; for others may grieve, and enjoy ſo much comfort as to complain, but this is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed me, for my miſery is ſhadowed with a Mask of happineſſe; and therefore, in lieu of pittie, I am rather blamed and taxed for a man of ſhallow judgment: But if you and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathea</hi> knew, what bitter wormwood I do meet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> he, unleſſe you will get me leave to depart. Would you have me ſolicite <hi>Galathea</hi> for it, (ſaid ſhe)? I beſeech you do it, (ſaid he) and I conjure you to it by that which you moſt love. That then muſt be your ſelfe, (ſaid the Nymph, and bluſht). And ſo ſhe went out of the Chamber to ſeek <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea,</hi> whom ſhe found alone in the Garden, and who already began to ſuſpect, that <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nida</hi> was in love with him, conceiving that ſhe had not made any progreſſe in the charge which ſhe gave her, though ſhe ſeldome or never ſtirred from him: Alſo knowing very well, how charming the ſhepheard's beauty was, ſhe imagined, that he might as well wound two as one; yet, being conſtrained to carry fair with her, ſhe continued her uſuall affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and ſeeing her come towards her, ſhe enquired of her how the ſhepheard did: As they were walking together, <hi>Galathea</hi> turned her ſelfe towards <hi>Leonida,</hi> and ſaid, Well <hi>Leonida,</hi> tell me, was there ever ſuch a piece of inſenſibilitie as <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſince neither my behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, nor your perſwaſions, will work with him? I cannot tell what to think of him. For
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53526:23"/>
my part anſwered <hi>Leonida,</hi> I rather think him of a mean ſpirit, and wants judgment than one that wants apprehenſion, he wants courage to pretend ſo high: Your perfections and favours cannot raiſe his thoughts ſo high, but the poorneſſe of his merits and qualitie does more deject him; and no wonder, Vines will bear Grapes, and Okes Acornes, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing will produce according to its nature. Can you imagine, that the courage of a Country Clown can produce any deſignes, but ſuch as proceed from a baſe and Peſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique ſpirit? I do believe (anſwered <hi>Galathea)</hi> that the great difference between our qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities may beget a great reſpect in him; but, I cannot think him ſo dully ignorant, as not to underſtand unto what end I treat him ſo kindly: the greater fear is, that he is already ſo far engaged to <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that he cannot retire. Aſſure your ſelfe, Madam, replyed <hi>Leon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> it is nothing but a ſottiſh ignorance in him: I do believe as you do, that he loves <hi>Aſtreat</hi> but if he had any Judgment, he would ſlight her for you, who beyond all degrees of compariſon does merit more then ſhe. And yet he is ſo ſenceleſly ſimple that whenſoever I ſpeak of you, he anſwers me with his ſorrows for being ſo farre from <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and thinkes his being here, no better then a torment. This very morning hearing him ſigh, I asked him the reaſon, and he made me ſuch an anſwer as would have moved ſtones to pitty him: and the concluſion of all was, that I would be a Mediator unto you for his departure. Come come <hi>Leonida,</hi> (replyed <hi>Galathea,</hi> even red againe with anger, and unable to diſſemble her jealouſie) confeſſe the truth: has he not moved you? Yes Madam (anſwered ſhe) he has moved me to pitty him and me thinkes, ſince he has ſuch an extream deſire to go you ought not to keep him by force for Love is never whipped into a heart. I do not meane a matter of pitty (replyed <hi>Galathea)</hi> but tis no matter; perhaps when he is well recovered, he ſhall feele the effects of that anger which he hath infuſed into me, as ſoone as thoſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Love which he hath infuſed into you: meane time let me tell you, he ſhall not go from hence, when he, but when I will: as for you <hi>Leonida,</hi> (continued ſhe) content you that I ſay no more only be gone I care not for your company now you know my mind. Thus <hi>Leonida</hi> was put to ſilence, and forc'd to go away, taking this affront ſo to heart, that ſhe reſolved to go unto <hi>Adamas</hi> her Unckle, and never have any more to do with <hi>Galatheas</hi> ſecrets. <hi>Galathea,</hi> at the ſame time called for <hi>Silvia</hi> who was walking alone in another Alley. Unto whom, contrary to her deſigne, ſhe imparted that which ſhe had ſo cloſely concealed from her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and complayned againſt <hi>Leonida.</hi> But <hi>Silvia,</hi> though young yet full of diſcretion, did indeavour to excuſe <hi>Leonida</hi> all ſhe could; apprehending very wiſely, that if her companion ſhould be angry, and things come to be knowne, they would prove very ſcandalous unto her Miſtriſſe. And therefore after many other paſſages ſhe ſaid thus unto her. You know Madam that you never opened any thing of this buſineſſe unto me; and yet I can tell you ſo many particulars, as you ſhall ſee I was not altogether ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as I ſeemed. But ſuch is my humor, that I never could endure to meddle in matters, unto which I am not called. But perceiving my companion ſo aſſiduous about <hi>Celadon,</hi> I ſuſpected that Love might be the cauſe, more then her compaſſion upon his maladie; and becauſe it was a buſineſſe which neerely concerned us all, I reſolved before I ſpoke any more of it, to be a little better aſſured, and therefore began to obſerve her actions more narrowly then I was accuſtomed; ſo as I got behind the ſhepherds bed whilſt he was a ſleep, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently <hi>Leonida</hi> entred, who making a little noiſe, did waken him: then after much common diſcourſe, ſhe began to talk of his affection unto the ſhepherdeſſe <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and of hers to him: but beleeve me ſhepherd (ſaid ſhe) <hi>Aſtreas</hi> Love is nothing in compariſon of <hi>Galatheas</hi> unto you. To me? (ſaid he) Yes to you (replyed <hi>Leonida)</hi> you need not wonder ſo at it, for you know how oft I have told you ſo though all the language I have, cannot ſet forth the magnitude of it. Fair Nymph, (anſwered the ſhepherd) I neither can merit nor beleeve, ſo great an honour unto me. For what can her deſigne be upon poor me, who am a ſilly ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd and will both live and die ſo? Your birth (replyed my companion) muſt needs be noble, ſince you are owner of ſo many excellent qualities and perfections. Oh <hi>Leonida</hi> (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the ſhepherd then) I cannot chuſe but think you Jeere me: can you think me ſo ignorant as not to know who <hi>Galathea</hi> is, &amp; who I am 'Certainly, fair Nymph I know, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then ſo how to meaſure the meaneſſe of my qualitie with the grandure of her merits: with the meaſure of duty: Oh ſhepherd (anſwered <hi>Leonida)</hi> do you think that Love uſeth the ſame meaſures that men do? No no, meaſures are uſed by ſuch as uſe to buy and ſellt gifts are never meaſured, and Love being nothing elſe but a meere gift, is never conferred by meaſures: never make any queſtion of this truth; but not to faile in your duty, pay unto her as much Love and affection as ſhe beſtowes upon you. I do profeſſe Madam, that till
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53526:24"/>
now, I thought <hi>Leonida</hi> had ſpoken for her ſelfe, and her diſcourſe aſtoniſhed me: but ſeeing with how much diſcretion your actions are managed, I did much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the power you have over them; knowing, that it is a thing of greater diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie to command ones ſelfe, then another. Sweet heart, (anſwered <hi>Galathea)</hi> did you but know, how I ſtand in need of <hi>Celadon's</hi> amitie, you would commend and adviſe me unto this deſigne: For, do you remember the Druide who told us our Fortunes? Yes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, anſwered ſhe, my memory is not ſo bad, as to forget a thing of ſo late an age. Then you remember (continued <hi>Galathea)</hi> how many truths he did foretell, both unto you and <hi>Leonida;</hi> and how he aſſured me, that if I married any other then <hi>Celadon,</hi> I ſhould be the moſt miſerable perſon upon earth: Now ſince our own experience may well make us credit what he foretells, why ſhould I ſlight a buſineſſe which ſo nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certies me? And therefore I take it very ill from <hi>Leonida,</hi> that ſhe ſhould offer to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant me. Madam, anſwered <hi>Silvia,</hi> I would adviſe you not to vex her too much, leſt ſhe ſhould be provoked to make a diſcovery of the buſineſſe. Friend, anſwered <hi>Galathea</hi> (and embraced her) I do apprehend your advice to be both faithfull and good, and therefore promiſe you, to carry my ſelfe towards <hi>Leonida</hi> according to your counſell. Whilſt they were thus diſcourſing, <hi>Leonida</hi> went to <hi>Celadon,</hi> unto whom ſhe related word for word, all the diſcourſe betwixt <hi>Galathea</hi> and her; and told him, that though the place where he was, ſeemed to be a place of freedome, yet, the truth was, it was no better then a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Which newes did ſo pierce him to the heart, that he fell into a Feavour, and in ſuch a violent degree, that <hi>Galathea</hi> coming to ſee him, and finding him ſo much impaired, ſhe began to doubt his life, eſpecially the next day, when he ſwounded two or three times in their armes: And though theſe Nymphs did continually watch with him without any reſt, but interrupted ſlumbers, yet was he but very ill attended, there being in that place no manner of Medicines for one that was ſick, nor durſt they ſend abroad for any, leſt the matter ſhould come to a diſcovery; ſo as the Shepheard did run a hazard of his life, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as one evening the Nymphs gave him for dead: But at laſt he returned to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and after an exceſſive bleeding, he took a little reſt; and therefore the Nymphs left him alone with <hi>Merill:</hi> And being retired, <hi>Silvia</hi> much affrighted at this accident, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed her ſelfe unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> and ſaid, Madam, we ſhall all be brought into ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, unleſſe you take ſome order; in what a caſe would you be in, if this Shepheard ſhould die in your hands, for want of help? Alas, anſwered ſhe, I have conſidered all this, ever ſince his diſeaſe encreaſed; but what remedie is there? We are here deſtitute of all neceſſaries for him, and as for getting them from other places, for my life I dare not, for fear of diſcovery. <hi>Leonida,</hi> whoſe affection made her ſpeak more reſolutely then <hi>Silvia,</hi> ſaid thus unto her; Madam, thoſe fears are very good, ſo far as they do not concern the life of a man. Suppoſe this ſhepheard ſhould die, can any imagine his death can be kept without diſcovery? the Heavens themſelves, as a puniſhment, will at laſt lay all open. But, take every thing at the worſt, and ſuppoſe it were known that this ſhepheard were here, cannot you cover your act with a mask of compaſſion? If you will be pleaſed to truſt me with the whole buſineſſe, I will manage it ſo, as none ſhall ever know it: For Madam, I have an Uncle in this Country, <hi>Adamas,</hi> the chiefe of the Druides, as you know very well: No ſecret in Nature, or vertue in any Plant, is hid from him; he is a man full of wiſdome and diſcretion, and I know, he has a particular inclination to do you ſervice; if you will employ him in the buſineſſe, I am confident, that all things will ſucceed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your wiſh. <hi>Silvia</hi> apprehending this to be the beſt expedient and conceiving that by the means of the grave <hi>Adamas, Galathea</hi> might perhaps be diverted from her thoughts of this ſhepheard; ſhe adviſed her unto it as the ſafeſt courſe: Unto which <hi>Galathea,</hi> for want of another, conſented. Then Madam (ſaid <hi>Leonida)</hi> to the end I may keep within the compaſſe of your commands, I beſeech you tell me what is your pleaſure I ſhould ſay, or conceal, from <hi>Adamas? Silvia</hi> ſeeing <hi>Galathea</hi> ſtand mute, anſwered, That the only way to move him unto ſecreſy, was, to ſeem as if he were wholly truſted in the buſineſſe; for nothing will ſooner make a ſecret come out, then miſtruſt: ſo as I conceive the way to charm <hi>Adamas</hi> unto privacy, is, to acquaint him before he comes with every thing, that he may diſcover when he is here. I am ſo much beſides my ſelfe, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> that I know not what to ſay, and therefore I refer the whole buſineſſe unto your diſcretions. Thus <hi>Leonida</hi> departed, with intention, though the night was very dark at firſt, not to ſtop, untill ſhe came at her Uncles, whoſe houſe was on the ſide of <hi>Marcelles</hi> Mountain, towards the Veſtalls and Druides of <hi>Laigneau;</hi> but her journey proved longer then ſhe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53526:24"/>
expected, for when ſhe came at the break of day unto the houſe of <hi>Adamas,</hi> ſhe found that he was gone to <hi>Feurs,</hi> and would not return, untill three daies, thence; and therefore after halfe an houres reſt, ſhe went away; yet, ſo weary, that had ſhe not been very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of her ſhepheard's cure, ſhe would have ſtayed untill the return of <hi>Adamas:</hi> but, after ſhe had gone a mile of her way, ſhe ſpied afar off in the ſame way a Nymph all alone, whom a little after ſhe knew to be <hi>Silvia:</hi> This encounter put her into a ſad perplexitie, fearing that <hi>Silvia</hi> brought the newes of <hi>Celadon's</hi> death; but it proved quite the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for ſhe brought newes, that ſince her departure he had reſted very well, and that the Feaver had left him; therefore <hi>Galathea</hi> had ſent her, to give a ſtop unto her proceedings, and to tell her, that ſince the ſhepheard was in ſo good a condition, there was no need of bringing <hi>Adamas,</hi> or diſcovering the buſineſſe unto him. It is eaſily imagined, how glad <hi>Lemida</hi> was of this newes; and after her thanks to Heaven, ſhe ſaid thus unto her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, Siſter, I underſtand, that <hi>Galathea</hi> has acquainted you with her deſigne upon this ſhepheard, and therefore in all freedome of language I will tell you, that this kinde of life doth infinitely diſpleaſe me, and that I think it diſhonourable both for her and us: for ſhe is ſo paſſionately humorous, that upon every diſtaſte this ſhepheard ſhall give her, ſhe will be halfe diſtracted; and builds ſo much upon the predictions of the Druide, as ſhe thinks all her happineſſe depends upon loving him: Alſo, as all Lovers do, ſhe thinks him ſo lovely, as ſhe believes every one does the like, as if all did look upon him with the ſame eyes ſhe doth and that's my griefe, for ſhe is growne ſo jealous of me, that ſhe cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure I ſhould come neer him. Now Siſter, if this kinde of life come once to be known, as queſtionleſſe it will; ſince nothing is ſo ſecret, but at laſt is diſcovered, judge you how the world will cenſure us: I, for my part, have uſed all poſſible arguments to divert from it, but all in vain. The ſcope of all this my diſcourſe is, that I do think very fit to finde out ſome good remedie, and that I can conceive no better expedient, then the interpoſition and mediation of my Uncle, who by his prudence and good counſell, may happily do ſome good upon her. Siſter, anſwered <hi>Silvia</hi> I do extreamly like your advice and that you may have more time to bring <hi>Adamas</hi> unto her, I will return, and tell her, that I have been at the houſe of <hi>Adamas;</hi> but found neither him nor you. 'Tis very well, replyed <hi>Leonida,</hi> and it will not be amiſſe, if we go and reſt our ſelves under ſome hedge, that it may ſeem as if you had been longer ſeeking me: Alſo, to tell you truly, I am ſo tired that if I will get to my journeyes end, I muſt ſleep a little. Come then (ſaid <hi>Silvia)</hi> and believe, it is a good work for your ſelfe, if you can get <hi>Celadon</hi> from amongſt us; for I do foreſee by <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathea's</hi> humour, that his ſtay here in a little time may cauſe you a great deal of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And ſo looking about for a convenient place, where they might paſſe away part of the day, they ſpied a place on the other ſide of <hi>Lignon,</hi> which ſeemed to be very fit for that purpoſe; ſo as paſſing over at the Bridge of <hi>Botereux,</hi> and leaving <hi>Bonlieu,</hi> the houſe of the Veſtalls and Druides, on the left hand, and walking down the River, they came to a handſom thicket of wood, where they both ſlept together. As they were thus repoſing themſelves, <hi>Aſtrea, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> did accidentally drive their flocks unto the ſame place; and never ſeeing the Nymphs, they ſat down by them. And as that friendſhip which reſeth out of adverſitie, is often more firme, then that of proſperitie; ſo <hi>Diana</hi> had contracted a moſt firme league with <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſince the diſaſter of <hi>Celadon;</hi> and ſuch a correſpondency was grown between them, that they were every day together. And certainly <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſtood in need of all conſolation, for almoſt at one and the ſame time, ſhe loſt <hi>Alces</hi> her Father <hi>Hippolita</hi> her Mother; <hi>Hippolita</hi> died of a fright, when ſhe heard that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was fallen into the water: and <hi>Alces</hi> dyed for griefe, at the loſſe of his deer Wife: But, theſe loſſes were a kinde of comfort unto her; for under the umbrage of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for her Father and Mother, ſhe could lament the loſſe of <hi>Celadon.</hi> Now as I told you before, <hi>Diana,</hi> the Daughter of prudent <hi>Belinda,</hi> to perform the rites of neighbourhood, did go often unto <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and found her humours ſo pleaſing, and ſhe hers, and <hi>Phillis</hi> both, that they vowed eternall friendſhip, and never ſince could ſeperate. This was the firſt day <hi>Aſtrea</hi> came out of her Chamber ſince her ſad diſaſters; and ſhe was no ſooner ſet down, but ſhe eſpied <hi>Semires</hi> coming towards her. This ſhepheard had been long in love with <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and knowing that ſhe loved <hi>Celadon,</hi> he cauſed this ſedition betwixt them, conceiving, that if he could once get rid of <hi>Celadon,</hi> then he ſhould with eaſe ſtep into his ſteed: And now he came unto her, in hopes to advance his deſigne, but he was much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken: for <hi>Aſtrea</hi> having ſmelt out his ſubtletie, ſhe conceived ſuch an inveterate hatred againſt him, that aſſoon as ſhe ſaw him, ſhe put her hand before her eyes, as unwilling to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53526:25"/>
look upon ſuch a baſe impoſtor, and deſired <hi>Phillis</hi> to go and tell him from her, that ſhe could not endure his company: Theſe words were pronounced with ſo much vehemency, as her companions plainly perceived her great animoſitie againſt him, which made <hi>Phillis</hi> more haſty in running towards this ſhepheard. When he heard this meſſage, he was ſo Planet-ſtruck, as he ſeemed abſolutely immovable: At laſt being conſcious, and ſtung with the bitter ſenſe of his own errour, he ſaid unto her, Diſcreet <hi>Phillis,</hi> I muſt needs ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly confeſſe, that the heavens are moſt juſt, in puniſhing a heart with more griefe, then it is able to endure; I cannot chuſe but ſadly ſay, that the chaſtiſement cannot equall the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, ſince I have deſtroyed the moſt perfect league of friendſhip that ever was. But, to the end the gods may ſtop their vengeance, I beſeech you tell that fair ſhepheardeſſe, I moſt cordially beg a pardon, both from her, and the aſhes of <hi>Celadon;</hi> and aſſure her, that the extream affection which I bore unto her, was the only cauſe of my fault: But, I will go, and all my life long lament I have offended her, and thoſe fair eyes which are ſo juſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt me. After theſe words he went away, ſo diſmally dejected, that his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance moved ſome pitty in the heart of <hi>Phillis;</hi> who being returned to her companions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated all his anſwer unto them. Alas, alas, dear Siſter, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> what ſad cauſe have I to flie from this fatall villain? for 'tis he, he only, that is the cauſe of all my miſerie. How Siſter (ſaid ſhe) <hi>Semires</hi> the cauſe? has he had ſuch power over you? If I durſt relate his villanie, and my own ſimplicitie (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea)</hi> I ſhould tell you, that he hath uſed the moſt cunning artifice, that ever any ſubtle wit could invent. <hi>Diana</hi> believing, that it was by reaſon of her, that ſhe would not ſpeak more clearly unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſince their familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was not above ſeven or eight daies old, ſhe turned towards the ſad <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and ſaid, Fair Shepheardeſſe, you will give me occaſion to think you do not love me, if you uſe leſſe freedome towards me then towards <hi>Phillis;</hi> for, though I have not been ſo long happy in your acquaintance as ſhe hath, yet, you may be as confident of my affection as of hers. <hi>Phillis</hi> then anſwered, I aſſure my ſelfe, that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> does ſpeak as freely before you, as to her own ſelfe, for ſhe cannot be halfe a friend; and ſince amitie is vowed betwixt your, I believe ſhe will open the very cloſſet of her heart unto you. Moſt certainly I will (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea)</hi> but the reaſon why I would ſpeak no more of that ſad buſineſſe, was only, becauſe I would not too much vex a wound, with too much rubbing upon it. If that be all, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Diana,</hi> I ſhould think, that free imparting a miſery unto a friend, is halfe the cure; and if I durſt uſe ſo much free boldneſſe, as to deſire it, nothing would give me greater ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, then to know the Hiſtorie of your life; which in requitall, I will repay with a relation of my own, whenſoever you ſhall command it. Since it is your deſire, replied <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I ſhall make you a ſharer in my miſerable ſtorie; but with much brevitie, unleſſe it were fuller of good fortune then it is: So all three ſitting round, ſhe thus began.</p>

For <hi>Celadon</hi> no ſooner arrived at the age of fourteen or fifteen yeares, and I at twelve or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, but at an aſſembly in the Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> which is upon the top of a high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, neer the Caſtle of Mount <hi>Briſon,</hi> this young ſhepheard ſaw me; and as he ſince hath told me he had long before an extream deſire of it, by ſome reports he had heard of me: but the jarres which were amongſt our Parents was the impediment which hindred him: and I muſt ingeniouſly confeſſe that I think his deſire of it, was no greater then mine. For I know not why, but when I heard ſpeak of him, my heart did beat; unleſſe it was a preſage of thoſe troubles which afterwards befell me by reaſon of him, When he firſt ſaw me, I cannot tell what cauſes of Love he found in me, but ſo it is, that ſince that time he reſolved to Love and ſerve me: and it ſeemes, that at the firſt enterview we were both ſtrucken with
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53526:25"/>
the darts of Love, for as ſoon as ever they told me that he was the Son of <hi>Alcippes,</hi> I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a kind of chang in me, which was not ordinary; then all his actions beg in to pleaſe me, and ſeemed much more agreeable unto me then any other young ſhepheard whatſoever; and becauſe he durſt not yet approach me, alſo becauſe ſpeaking with me was forbidden him, his looks and eys by their turning to &amp; fro did utter ſuch language unto me as I knew he deſired to ſay more. And indeed at a Braul which was held at the foot of a Mountain under a plump of antient Elmes which caſt a pleaſant ſhaddow, he carried it ſo cunningly, that without any heed of me, and ſeeming as if it were out of a merry careleſſeneſſe he got me by the hand. For my part, I ſeemed as if I took no notice of it, but carried my ſelfe to him as to all the reſt, but he in taking my hand, did ſtoope with his head as if he would kiſſe his hand but I perceived his mouth upon mine; this did cauſe ſome colour to come into my face: but I feigning to take no notice, did turne away my head, as if I only minded the braule which we danced: this cauſed him to ſtay a while ſilent, not knowing I beleeve, how he ſhould begin to ſpeak: at laſt being unwilling to loſe ſuch an opportunitie as this which he had long longed for, he came very neer me and whiſpering <hi>Corilas</hi> (who took me out to dance) in the eare, yet ſo loud (but ſeeming to whiſper) that I did plainly heare what he ſaid, Oh <hi>Corilas</hi> (ſaid he) I wiſh with all my ſoul that the quarrells between this ſhepherdeſſes Father and Mine, might be decided by her and me. To which <hi>Corilas</hi> anſwered very loud, Nay never wiſh that, <hi>Celadon,</hi> for perhaps it is the moſt dangerous wiſh, that ever you made. Let the hazard be what it will (anſwered <hi>Celadon</hi> very lond) I'le not go from what I have ſaid, though I were to give my heart, as a pledge. And becauſe I ſeemed to take no notice of their diſcourſes, he addreſſed himſelfe unto me and thus ſaid: And you fair ſhepheardeſſe, what opinion have you of this offer? I do not know, anſwered I, what you ſpeak of. He told me, replied <hi>Corilas,</hi> that to draw a great good from a great evil, he wiſhes that the inveterate hatred of your Fathers, were changed into love amongſt their Children. How, (anſwered I, ſeeming not to know him) are you <hi>Alcippes</hi> Son? Yes, (anſwered he) and more then that; I am your moſt devoted ſervant. Me thinkes, ſaid I, that it had been more proper for you to have applied your diſcourſe unto ſome other, who may be more agreeable to you then I: I have heard ſay, replied <hi>Celadon,</hi> that the gods do uſe to puniſh the ſinns of the Fathers upon their Children; but this is not the uſe amongſt men, unleſſe your beauty, which is divine, will aſſume the ſame priviledges with the gods: and if you do, then like them, you muſt give pardon when it is asked: how now ſhepheard (ſaid <hi>Corilas)</hi> what? Do you begin your combate with crying mercy? In ſuch a combate as this anſwered he, to be vanquiſhed is a kind of victory: and for my part, I am moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be ſo, provided ſhe will be pleaſed to take the ſpoile. I think, they had continued their diſcourſe longer, had the Brawle, longer laſted: but at laſt we parted, and every one returned to his place.</p>
               <p>Not long after the ſhepheards uſed ſeverall exerciſes, as wraſtling, running, leaping, and throwing the barre; and a Garland to be given unto him, who got the better in the ſeverall activities. <hi>Celadon,</hi> as being too young was admitted only unto that of running, and did win the Garland, compoſed of divers flowers, which was put upon his head by all the aſſembly with high commendations, that being ſo young as he was, he ſhould overcome ſo many other nimble ſhepheards. He, not valuing himſelf did take it from his head, and put it upon mine, ſaying, This, fair one, is in confirmation of what I ſaid before. I was ſo ſurpriſed at this that I could not return any anſwer: &amp; had it not been for <hi>Artemis,</hi> your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Phillis,</hi> I had given it unto him again; not but that coming from his hand, it was very acceptable unto me; but it was becauſe I feared <hi>Alces</hi> and <hi>Hippolyta</hi> would be angry with me. But <hi>Artemis</hi> who deſired rather, to extinguiſh then enflame theſe old grudges, did command me to receive it, and thank him. Which accordingly I did, but in ſuch a hollow manner as made every one think I did it only upon my Aunts command. All that day was thus ſpent, and the next day alſo; in both which, the young ſhepheard loſt no opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of manifeſting his affection. And it was the cuſtome upon the third day, in the honour of <hi>Venus,</hi> to repreſent the judgement which <hi>Paris</hi> gave of the three goddeſſes. <hi>Celadon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to put himſelf amongſt the Maides in the habit of a ſhepherdeſſe. You know that upon the third day after the banquett, he Grand <hi>Druide</hi> has a cuſtome to throw a Golden Apple amongſt the Maides, upon which are written the names of the three ſhepheardeſſes which ſeem unto him to be the faireſt of all the company, with this <hi>Motto, Let this be given to the faireſt of the three.</hi> Afterwards the perſon that by lot was to repreſent <hi>Paris,</hi> does enter into the Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> with the three ſhepheardeſſes; where the dores being
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53526:26"/>
ſhut, judgement is given upon the beauty of theſe three ſeeing them all naked, except for a linnen cover which reacheth from the middle to the knee, and becauſe ſome abuſe had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been by ſome ſhepheards who uſed to mixe themſelves amongſt the ſhepheardeſſes, it was ordained by publique Edict, that he who ſhould commit the like crime, ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remiſſion be ſtoned by the Maides at the gates of the Temple: but ſo it was, that this young Boy, never conſidering the extream danger of it, did this day dreſſe himſelfe in the habit of a ſhepherdeſſe, and putting himſelfe into our company was taken for a maide. Then as if fortune was reſolved to favour him, my name, and <hi>Malthea,</hi> and <hi>Stella,</hi> were written upon the Apple, and when they came to draw the name that was to repreſent <hi>Paris,</hi> I heard <hi>Orithea</hi> named, which was the name that <hi>Celadon</hi> took upon him. Heavens knowes whether his ſoul was not infinitly joyed to ſee his deſigne thrive ſo well. At the laſt, we were conducted into the Temple, where the Judge being ſet upon his Throne, the dores ſhut, and we three only within with him, we began, according to the Law, to undreſſe our ſelves; and becauſe each apart did go and ſpeak unto the Iudge, and offer, as heretofore the three Goddeſſes did unto <hi>Paris; Stella</hi> was the quickeſt to undreſſe her ſelfe, and did firſt preſent her ſelfe whom the Judge did a while contemplate, and after a full hearing what ſhe would ſay for her ſelfe, he cauſed her to retire, and give place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Malthea,</hi> who was forwarder in undreſſing her ſelfe then I was; for I being much aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſhew my ſelfe ſo naked, I trifled out the time as much as I could. <hi>Celadon,</hi> unto whom time ſeemed too long, and after he had ſlightly looked upon <hi>Malthea,</hi> ſeeing I did not come, he called me; ſo, ſince conſtrained I went: But, Oh Heavens! how much aſhamed am I to think upon it? My haire was diſhevel'd, and almoſt covered me, over which, all the ornament I had, was the Garland which the day before he had given me. When the reſt were retired, and he ſaw me in this then dreſſe before him, I obſerved, that he changed colour two or three times; but I could not yet ſo much as ſuſpect the cauſe. For my part, ſhame had ſo dyed my cheeks with a freſh colour, that he has ſince vowed unto me, he never ſaw me fairer, and could have been well contented to have ſpent the whole day in this contemplation; but fearing to be diſcovered, he was conſtrained to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge his delight: And ſeeing I ſaid nothing unto him (for ſhame had tyed up my tongue) Why fair Star (ſaid he unto me) do you think your cauſe ſo good, that as the reſt have done, you need not plead it before your judge? No <hi>Orithia,</hi> anſwered I, I will ſubmit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Stella</hi> and <hi>Malthea,</hi> both as well in beautie, as in Rhetorick; ſo as had not cuſtomobli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ged me to come, I ſhould never have appeared before you, in any hopes to win the priſe. But if you do carry it from them both, anſwered the ſhepheard, what remuneration may I expect from you? I ſhall then think (ſaid I unto him,) that, I have more then I do deſerve What? (ſaid he) is this all the offer that you make? I know not what to offer (ſaid I, unto him) that deſerves a reception; and therfore you muſt firſt aske. Then ſwear unto me, (ſaid the ſhepheard) that you will give me what I ſhall aske, and my judgement ſhall be in your advantage. After I had promiſed that I would, he asked a lock of my hair, for a Bracelet which I gave him; and after he had lapt it up in a paper he ſaid unto me; now <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I will keep this hair as a teſtimonie of this oath which you have taken, to the end that if ever you break it, I may offer it unto the Goddeſſe <hi>Venus</hi> and beg revenge. That is but ſuperfluous, anſwered I, ſince I am fully reſolved never to faile in it. Then with a ſmiling countenance he ſaid unto me, the gods be praiſed, my faireſt <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that my deſigne hath ſo happily proſpered; for know, that the thing which you have promiſed is, to Love me better then any in the world, and to receive me as your moſt fathfull and vowed Servant, who am <hi>Celadon,</hi> and not <hi>Orithea,</hi> as you imagine: the very ſame <hi>Celadon,</hi> that in ſpight of all old emnities betwixt our Parents, is ſo infinitly devoted yours, as he will rather die at the dore of the Temple, then not give a teſtimony of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection unto you. Imagine, wiſe <hi>Diana,</hi> in what a perplexitie I was now in: Love did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid me from taking revenge; yet ſhame did animate me againſt Love: at laſt after a confuſed diſpute with my ſelf, I could not poſſibly conſent to make him die, becauſe his offence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded only from his exceſſe of loving me: but now knowing him to be a ſhepheard, I could not any longer ſtay in his ſight: but without returning any anſwer, I ran to my compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whom I found to be almoſt dreſſed; and not well knowing what I did, I dreſſed my ſelf as ſoon as poſſibly I could: But to be ſhort; when we were al ready, the diſguiſed <hi>Orithea</hi> ſtood at the threſhold of the dore, and having all three about him: I do ordaine, ſaid he, that the priſe of beauty be given unto <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> in teſtimonie whereof I do preſent unto her the golden apple: let none ever doubt of my judgement, for I have veiwed and examined
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53526:26"/>
her, and finds her to be full of all perfection. Upon theſe words, he preſented the apple un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, which I received with a troubled mind: but more, when he ſaid unto me in a low voice, take this apple as a pledge of my affection, which, like it, is pure, and endleſſe: To whom I anſwered be contented, raſh youth, that I receive it only to ſave thy life, which otherwiſe, comming from thy hand, I would refuſe. He could not reply for fear of being heard and known. And becauſe it was the cuſtom, that ſhe who received the Ball, ſhould by way of thankes, kiſs the Judge, I was conſtrained to kiſſe him. But, I aſſure you, I was at this ceremonie almoſt ready to diſcover him. Then the grand <hi>Druide</hi> cauſed me to be carried in a chair, through all the croud with loud applauds and acclamations, ſo as every one did wonder why I did not enjoy this honour with more alacrity for truly I was ſo confounded betwixt Love and Anger, that I hardly knew what I did. As for <hi>Celadon,</hi> as ſoone as the ceremonies were done, he thruſt himſelf amongſt the reſt of the ſhepherds and by little and little without any notice taken, got out of the croud and putting off his bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed habit, he aſſumed his own, in which he came preſently unto us with ſuch confident lookes, as none could ever ſuſpect him: For my part when I ſaw him again, my heart was ſo full of ſhame and anger, that it would ſcarcely let my eyes look upon him: but he who did take a ſeeming regardleſſe notice of it, did find an occaſion to accoſt me, and in a loud voice ſaid: The Judge who conferred the priſe upon you, hath ſhewed himſelf a very right Judge of beauty, and yet, though your cauſe did merit his ſentence, you are in ſome ſort obliged unto him. I think ſhepheard, anſwered I in a low voice, that he is more obliged to me then I to him: for he gave me an apple only, which in ſome degree, I deſerve and is my due; but I gave him his life, which for his impudent raſhneſſe he deſerved to loſe. This is no more then was before reſolved (anſwered <hi>Celadon)</hi> for he does not valew his life fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to proſtrate it at your feet. Were it not more in regard of my ſelf then him, replied I, I ſhould have puniſhed his impudence: but, <hi>Celadon,</hi> no more; let us leave this diſcourſe: and, know that the reaſon why I did not cauſe you to be puniſhed according to your merits is, only becauſe I would not bring my ſelfe upon the ſtage, and not for want of any will to ſee you chaſtised. If that be the only reaſon, ſaid he, I beſeech you tell me what death you will have me die: And you ſhall ſee that I have as much courage to obey you, as I have Love to offend you.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe would be very long and tedious, if I ſhould include every particular. But ſo it was, he gave me ſo many teſtimonies of his affection, that I could not poſſibly doubt it: but ſtill ſeeming to be all anger, I ſaid thus unto him Shepheard, conſider the emnity that is betwixt our Fathers, &amp; believe that mine to thee ſhal be the ſame, if thou doſt ſtill thus trouble me with thy follies, which for this time, thy youth and my own honour moves me to pardon. I mentioned a pardon, becauſe I would infuſe a little courage unto him: for the very truth is, his beautie, and courage, and affection, did pleaſe me; but to the end he ſhould not reply, I turned from him and went to <hi>Stella,</hi> who was neer me. He all aſtoniſhed at this anſwer, went out of the company ſo ſadly dejected as in a few dayes after he was grown not knowable, and kept himſelf ſo private that, he frequented no places but the moſt retired and wild partes of our woods. Of which, I being advertiſed by ſome of my companoins, who did in a cloſe manner tell me that I was the only cauſe; I began to reſent his condition, and reſolved to find out ſome way or other to give him a little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; and becauſe, as I told you, he ſhunned all manner of company, I was conſtrained to drive my flock towards that place which he moſt frequented: and after two or three times being there in vaine, at laſt after a long ſearch for him, me thought I heard his voice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſome trees, and I was not miſtaken. For going neerer; I found him lying all along upon the ground, his eyes ſweld with teares, and hands held up to heaven which ſeemed to be immoveable. This object moved me to ſo much pitty, that I was reſolved to give him a cordiall for his paine. And therefore, after a whiles conſideration, and not willing he ſhould think I ſought for him, I retired a little way from him, where ſeeming to take no notice I began to ſing, ſo loud that my voice reached both his eares and his heart. As ſoon as ever he heard me, I ſaw him leap up and turning his eyes towards the place where I was, he ſtood like a ſtatue ſtill in a raviſhing admiration. Which I obſerving, to give him ſo much boldneſſe as to approch neerer, I ſeemed as if I ſlept, yet held mine eyes halfe open to ſee what he would do. And indeed, he did as I did imagine he would: for drawing neerer me with a ſoft and gentle tread, he kneeled down as neer me as he could; and after a long ſtay in this poſture I ſtill ſeeming to be faſt aſleep, he ſtooped down and kiſſed me. Then ſeeing that he had taken courage enough; I opened mine eyes as if he had wakened me. And riſing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53526:27"/>
up as if in a raging anger, thus ſaid unto him. Uncivill ſhepherd, how durſt you be ſo bold as thus to interrupt my ſleep? He, with a trembling heart, and kneeling ſtill, ſaid thus unto me; It is your ſelfe fair ſhepherdeſſe, that did conſtrain me, and if I have ſinned, then, bright Starre, you muſt dim your Luſter, and puniſh your own perfections, which are the cauſe. This is alwayes your excuſe for your preſumption (ſaid I unto him) but ſhepheard beleeve it, if you continue in this courſe of offending me, I will not endure it. If you call it an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, to love and adore you (anſwered he) proceed to ſentence immediatly, and doome me to what death you pleaſe: for I do make a moſt ſolemne vow, that I will ſo offend you as long as my life is in me. It is neither the rigour of your cruelties, nor the emnity of our Parents, no, nor all the impediments in the whole univerſe conſpired together ſhall ever divert me from this reſolution. But, Fair <hi>Diana</hi> I muſt abbreviate theſe pleaſing diſcourſes, as being not ſutable unto my preſent diſaſters, And will only tell you, that being overcome I ſaid thus unto him; ſhepheard what good can you hope for, when thoſe who have the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of you, does diſapprove of your beginning? How? Said he, diſpoſe of me? Has <hi>Alcippe</hi> more power over my wil then I have my ſelf. You may diſpence with your own wil (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red I) but never with that obedience which is due unto a Father, without a moſt horrid crime. The obedience which I owe unto him (ſaid he) muſt be confined unto poſſibilities and it is no fault to faile, where power wants to performe: but admit, I muſt obey in al things, ſince of two evills, the greater is to be avoided. I will rather faile in my duty to him who is but a man, then in my duty to your fair ſelfe, who is all Divine. Our diſcourſe laſted ſo long, and ſo prevalent he was in it, that I was forced to admit him my ſervant: and both of us being too young to ſhadow our deſignes with any artifice, <hi>Alcippe</hi> did ſoone find us out; and being loath this amitie ſhould grow up to any higher pitch, he reſolved to ſend him upon ſo long a voyage with good old <hi>Cleantes,</hi> as that abſence might wear out this young impreſſion of Love, But the ſeperation did as little good as all the reſt of his artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which he uſed: for <hi>Celadon,</hi> though yet a Boy, did ſo fixe his reſolution to overcome all difficulties, that though any other would have taken them for torments, yet he looked upon them only as proofes of himſelfe, and called them the touchſtones of his fidelitie. And becauſe he knew that his voyage would laſt long, he intreated me leave to bid him adieu. This leave I granted; but, Fair <hi>Diana,</hi> had you heard how paſſionatly he begged me to Love him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the vowes he made never to change, doubtleſſe you would have concluded nothing more impoſſible, then that this affection ſhould ever decay. At laſt ſince his time of ſtay was but ſhort, he thus ſaid unto me. My <hi>Aſtrea</hi> (for ſo he phraſed me alwaies in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate) I ſhall leave with you my Brother <hi>Lycidas,</hi> from whom I will never conceale any of my thoughts he knowes how I have vowed my ſelfe unto your ſervice, I beſeech you promiſe me, (if it be your pleaſure I ſhould depart with any joy) that you will receive as from me all the ſervices which he ſhall do you and by his preſence renew the memorie of abſent <hi>Celadon.</hi> And truly he had good reaſon to make this requeſt unto me. For <hi>Lycidas</hi> during his abſence, was ſo diligent to obſerve his Brothers commands, that many thought that he ſucceeded his Brother, in the affection which he bore unto me: this was the reaſon why <hi>Alcippes</hi> after he had kept him three yeares out of this Country, did call him home, in a confidence that ſo long a time had worne away that light impreſſion of Love, which had a little entred into his green heart; and that he being now grown more wiſe, would weane <hi>Lycidas</hi> alſo from my affection. But his returne was an extreame aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his fidelitie abſence could not extinguiſh the ardency ot his Love; no nor all the ſo much admired Romane beauties, could ever ſtartle him. He intreated me by his Brother, that I would give him leave to come unto me: Oh Heavens, how gladly did he come when I gave him licence? I think I have his Letters about me, for alas, I have kept them better then him: then pulling a little bundle out of her pocket, like unto that which <hi>Celadon</hi>
uſed to carry, or in imitation of him and in which ſhe very charily preſerved thoſe which came from him, ſhe took the firſt, for ſhe kept them in order as they came unto her, then after ſhe had wiped away her pearly teares, ſhe read theſe words.</p>

               <p>Fair <hi>Diana,</hi> it is impoſſible to remember all the diſcourſe we then had unleſſe I ſhould open thoſe wounds again, which are more dolorous to me then death. During <hi>Celadons</hi> abſence, <hi>Artemis</hi> my Aunt and Mother of <hi>Phillis,</hi> did come upon a viſit unto us, and brought with her this Fair ſhepherdeſſe, <hi>Phillis:</hi> And becauſe our manner of living, ſeemed more pleaſant unto her then the ſhepherds of <hi>Allier</hi> ſhe was pleaſed to ſtay with us, which, beleeve it, was no ſmall contentment unto me: for her humours were very pleaſing unto me, and I have paſſed over many tedious hours with her. When <hi>Celadon</hi> returned his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſo good, and he liked her ſo well, as I may truly ſay he was the cauſe of the great League, which ever ſince hath been twixt her and me. At this time he arrived at the age of ſeaventeen or eighteen, and I at fifteen or ſixteen, and began to manage matters with more prudence: ſo as, to diſguiſe our loves, I did intreat him, or rather indeed conſtraine him, to be very familiar with all ſhepheardeſſes which could pretend unto any ſhadow of Beauty; to the end his applications unto me might be taken rather as common, then particular. I ſay, I conſtreyned him unto it, for he did ſeverall times upon his knees begge for a revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this command; and alas, he had good reaſon ſo to do, for he did too well foreſee, that from hence would proceed the cauſe of his death. Excuſe me, wiſe <hi>Diana,</hi> if a few due teares interrupt my diſcourſe, ſince I have ſo much ſad cauſe for them, as it were impiety to ſtop them: Then after ſhe had dryed her eyes, ſhe began her diſcourſe again.</p>
               <p>And becauſe that <hi>Phillis</hi> was moſt commonly with me, it was unto her that he firſt made his addreſſes unto, according to my command. I could ſcarſly forbear my ſmiles, eſpecially when <hi>Phillis</hi> beleeved him to be in good earneſt, and treated him as it is the cuſtome to treat ſuch as begin the like addreſſes. I remember that when he was once very ſharply treated, he ſang this Song which he compoſed upon this ſubject.</p>

               <p>I do very well remember (ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi> and interrupted her) how his addreſſes unto me made you laugh: for commonly his diſcourſe, was only a few fragments of words ſo diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as they could hardly hold ſenſe: And commonly when he would name me, his thoughts ſo run upon you, that he would call me <hi>Aſtrea:</hi> But ſee the variety of ſeverall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations! I know very well that <hi>Celadon</hi> had ſome advantages of nature above <hi>Lycidas;</hi> yet I thought, though I knew no reaſon for it, <hi>Lycidas</hi> to be much more agreeable unto my fancy. Siſter, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi> to her, you bring into my memorle a diſcourſe which once he had concerning you and this fair ſhepheardeſſe, (ſaid ſhe and turned towards <hi>Diana)</hi> Fair ſhepherdeſſe (ſaid he to me) the wiſe <hi>Belinda</hi> and <hi>Artemis</hi> your Aunt, are infinitly happy in two Daughters; and our <hi>Lignon</hi> is much obliged unto them ſince by their meanes it has the honour to have theſe two fair ones upon their bankes. And if I have any judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they only do merit the amitie of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and therefore I do adviſe you to love them, for by that ſhort acquaintance I have had with them, I do foreſee, you will receive much ſatisfaction in their familiarity: I wiſh that one of them would daigne to look upon my Brother <hi>Lycidas</hi> with as much affection as I do. And then, fair <hi>Diana,</hi> having but little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with you, I anſwered him, that my deſire was, he ſhould rather become a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant unto <hi>Phillis:</hi> and it hapned as I did wiſh: for ordinarie diſcourſe between them firſt begot a familiaritie, and at laſt a Love in good earneſt between them. One day finding fit opportunitie for it, he reſolved to declare his affection to her, and to couch the moſt Love in the feweſt words he was able. Fair one (ſaid he to her) I hope you know your ſelfe ſo well, as to beleeve, that thoſe who love you muſt needs love you infinitly: It muſt be my actions only which muſt make my affection known unto you; and at the firſt begge no more then an admittance into your favour. <hi>Celadon</hi> and I were ſo neer, as we could hear this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, and alſo the anſwer which <hi>Phillis</hi> returned, and which indeed was more ſharp then I expected from her. For ſhe and I did long before know, by the eyes and actions of <hi>Lycidas</hi> that he loved her, and ſhe did not diſlike of it, that at this time ſhe anſwered him with ſo much ſharpneſſe, that <hi>Lycidas</hi> was almoſt deſperate: and <hi>Celadon</hi> who loved his Brother very much, being extreamly angry he ſhould receive ſuch a baffle, he was halfe angry with me, at which I could not chuſe but laugh, and at laſt tell him: Never be ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry <hi>Celadon</hi> at this harſh anſwer which <hi>Lycidas</hi> hath received: <hi>Phillis</hi> could do no leſſe; ſhepheards of theſe times, do too much glorie in the eaſineſſe of their Miſtriſſes: but to the end you may ſee that I do very well know the humour of <hi>Phillis,</hi> I will undertake to bring <hi>Lycidas</hi> into favour with her, provided he will but practiſe a little patience and continue on his addreſſes. I muſt confeſſe, when firſt I ſpake unto her, ſhe was ſo ſhie, as I knew not what to think, but ſtill hoped and reſolved to win her with time: But <hi>Lycidas</hi> he was out of all patience, and reſolved to give her over, and Love her no longer: upon which occaſion he writ theſe verſes.</p>

               <p>Afterwards we heard him break out into theſe dolefull expreſſions, lifting up his eyes to Heaven: O ye gods (ſaid he) if you are angry with me, becauſe I do with more devotion adore the work of your hands, then I do you; I hope you will pardon that error, which you your ſelves have cauſed: Had it been contrary to your will, that <hi>Phillis</hi> ſhould be adored, ſurely you would have made her with fewer perfections, or elſe infuſed leſſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them into me. Would it not be prophanation, to offer leſſe affection unto a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie of ſuch ſuperlative excellencies, as ſhe is adorned with? I believe this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard continued in ſuch diſcourſes, but I could not hear them; for <hi>Phillis</hi> forcing me by the arme I went with her: And when we were gone a little further, I ſaid unto her, Stony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted <hi>Phillis,</hi> why have you no more pitty upon this Shepheard, that is ready to die for you? Siſter, anſwered ſhe, the Shepheards of this Country are ſo full of diſſimulation, that their hearts do commonly denie, what their tongues do promiſe; And if you do well obſerve this Shepheard here, you will finde him all Artifice; and as for thoſe expreſſions which now we have heard, I do believe, that when he eſpied us coming, he ſet himſelf in the way purpoſely, that we might hear his diſſembling complaints; otherwiſe, had they not been better ſpoken unto us then to the aire and ſenſleſſe woods? Siſter, ſaid I, you have forbidden him any addreſſes to you Even this, anſwered ſhe, is a great argument of his little love to me. Is any command of power enough, to ſtop the current of a violent affection? Believe it Siſter, Love that can bend, is never ſtrong: Do you think I ſhould
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53526:29"/>
have loved him leſſe, if he had diſobeyed me? But Siſter, ſaid I unto her, he has obeyed you, and will you be angry with him for that? It's true Siſter, replied ſhe, he has obeyed me; but let me tell you, that I hold this obedience for very great diſobedience; and leaving off his adreſſes to me, argues his paſſion very indifferent. If I had not interrupted her, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſhe would have continued her diſcourſe much longer; but becauſe I much deſired, that <hi>Lycidas</hi> might finde better entertainment for <hi>Celadon's</hi> ſake, I told her, that this kinde of diſcourſe did become her towards <hi>Lycidas,</hi> but not towards me: Towards <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas</hi> it was allowable, by way of tryall, and I commended it; but towards me, it argued too much diſtruſt, to conceal any ſecret of her ſoul. As for my part I would open all my heart unto her, and therefore told her, that ſince it was impoſſible, but ſhe muſt love ſome or other, ſhe could not make a better choice then of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> ſince ſhe might already ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moſt certain ſymptomes of his affection. To which ſhe anſwered, that ſhe never did, nor would, diſſemble or conceal any of her thoughts from me, but ſhould be extreamly ſorry I ſhould have any ſuch opinion of her. And ſince I would have her entertain <hi>Lycidas,</hi> ſhe would obey me. And hereupon <hi>Celadon</hi> finding her afterwards with me, brought her this Letter from his Brother, which was indited by my advice.</p>

               <p>At laſt, wiſe <hi>Diana</hi> after many a perſwaſive argument, we brought things to that paſſe, as <hi>Lycidas</hi> was entertained; and ever ſince, all foure of us have found much contentment in our lives, and invented many a ſtratagem to colour our deſignes, both by diſcourſe and by writing one unto another. Perhaps you have taken notice of a great Rock, in the high way towards <hi>Rochell,</hi> which without much ado cannot be aſcended, but when one is at the top, there is no fear of any eye to diſcover. And becauſe it was neer the high way, we made choice of it for our rendevouz; if any did meet us, we ſeemed as if we went on in the high-way; but when the coaſt was clear, we aſcended. 'Tis true, that this Rock being ſo neer the high way, we were in ſome danger of being heard by paſſengers, if we ſpoke any thing loud and therefore commonly, <hi>Lycidas</hi> or <hi>Phillis</hi> were placed as guards, to ſpie when any came: And becauſe buſineſſe did ſometimes ſo employ us, as we could not every day meet in this place, we uſed to write one to another, and we made choice of another place of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniercy, in which we laid our Letters one to another. In briefe, wiſe <hi>Diana,</hi> we uſed all poſſible waies to conceal our ſelves; and <hi>Celadon</hi> and I, did ſo ſeldome converſe together in publick, as many believed that <hi>Celadon's</hi> will was wholly changed; for aſſoon as ever he ſaw <hi>Phillis,</hi> then he made all his applications unto her, and ſhe again treated him with all poſſible complacency: Alſo as ſoon as <hi>Lycidas</hi> appeared, I left all other company to talk with him; ſo as in a ſhort time, <hi>Celadon</hi> himſelfe had a conceit, that I loved <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and I believed that he loved <hi>Phillis: Phillis</hi> thought that <hi>Lycidas</hi> loved me, and <hi>Lycidas</hi> believed that <hi>Phillis</hi> loved <hi>Celadon:</hi> And thus unawares were we ſo intangled with theſe opinions, as jealouſie began by degrees to kindle amongſt us. The truth is (ſaid <hi>Phillis)</hi> we were then but freſh Schollars in the School of Love; for to what purpoſe was it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal a reall love, and publiſh a falſe one? was there not as much cauſe to fear the divulging of your love to <hi>Lycidas,</hi> as your love to <hi>Celadon?</hi> Siſter, ſiſter, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> when a thing is not, we never fear what people think of it: But the contrary, when it is, then the leaſt ſuſpition of it, puts all out of order. But now (continued ſhe, and turned to <hi>Diana),</hi> jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie had ſo ſeized upon all foure, as I believe our lives had not been long, if ſome good Genius had not inſpired us to make all clear in the preſence of one another. It was now ſeven or eight daies ſince we ſaw each other, at our Rocky rendevouz, and the Letters which paſſed 'twixt <hi>Celadon</hi> and me, were ſo different from the uſuall ſtrain, as if they were writ by different perſons. At laſt, as I told you, ſome good Angel having care of us, all foure did meet in one place, where no other company was: And <hi>Celadon,</hi> whoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection had moſt vigour in it, began thus to ſpeak, Fair <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> did I think that time
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53526:29"/>
would cure a diſeaſe that raignes in me, I would wait for that remedje; but ſince I know, the older it growes, the more it will encreaſe, I am forced to complain againſt you for the wrongs which you have done me, and with more alacritie, ſince I can do it before ſuch Judges as are my peers. When he would have gone on, <hi>Lycidas</hi> interrupted him, ſaying, that his pain was greater then his. Greater! ſaid <hi>Celadon,</hi> that's impoſſible, for mine is extream: And mine, believe it, ſaid <hi>Lycidas,</hi> is without any compariſon. Whilft the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards were thus debating the matter, I was upon <hi>Phillis,</hi> and ſaid, Do you ſee, Siſter, how theſe Shepheards complain of us? Yes, anſwered ſhe; but I believe we have greater cauſe to complain of them. Though I am much incenſed againſt <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſaid I unto her, yet, I am much more incenſed againſt you, who under a diſguiſe of friendſhip, which you ſeemed to bear unto him, has drawn him from that affection which he bare unto me, ſo as I may well ſay, you have ſtollen him from me. And becauſe <hi>Phillis</hi> ſtood ſilently amazed at this, and knew not what to anſwer, <hi>Celadon</hi> addreſſed himſelfe unto me, and ſaid, Ahl fair Shepheardeſſe, but as ſickle as fair; have you ſo ſoon loſt the memory of all <hi>Celadon's</hi> ſervices, and your own vowes? I cannot ſo much complain againſt <hi>Lycidas,</hi> as againſt you; for notwithſtanding the conſanguinity and amitie betwixt us, your perfections might well make him a Traitor, and forget his duty; but me thinks it ſhould be abſolutely impoſſible, that ſo long a ſervice as mine, and ſuch a perfect affection, ſhould ever finde the leaſt ſtain of inconſtancy in your ſoul. But admit, that all in me was too little, to deſerve ſo great a happineſſe, how can you ſo far violate and diſpence with your vowes, as before my eyes to entertain a new affection? At the ſame time <hi>Lycidas</hi> took <hi>Phillis</hi> by the hand, and with a deep ſigh, ſaid, Oh fair hand, to whom I had given up my ſoul! can I live, and ſee thee take poſſeſſion of any heart but my own? my owne, I ſay, that did deſerve the ſame happineſſe, if ever any did deſerve it, by the moſt ſincere and pure affection that ever was? I could not hear any more what <hi>Lycidas</hi> ſaid, becauſe I was conſtrained to anſwer <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi> Shepheard, Shepheard (ſaid I unto him) theſe words, Fidelity and Affection, are more converſant in your tongue then your heart, and I have more reaſon to complain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, then hearken unto them: but becauſe now I do not care for any thing that comes from you, I will not take ſo much pains as grieve at it; that office is more fitly yours, if your diſſembling heart would give you leave to do it. But, <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſince things are thus love on, love <hi>Phillis</hi> ſtill and ſerve her, her vertues will deſerve it; and if I do afford thee a bluſh, it is for anger that I ſhould ſuffer my ſelfe to be ſo groſly deceived, and for over-loving one that is ſo much unworthy of it as thy ſelfe. <hi>Celadon</hi> was ſo much aſtoniſhed at this, that he ſtood ſtock ſtill a long time, &amp; could not anſwer one word, which ſilence gave me leaſure to hearken unto that anſwer, which <hi>Phillis</hi> returned unto <hi>Lycidas: Lycidas, Lycidas,</hi> ſaid ſhe unto him, you that can call me ſickle, inconſtant, and I know not what; you know full well, that theſe titles are moſt ſuitable unto yourſelfe, and your own actions: Do you think that becauſe you have got the ſtart, and complain firſt, you can therefore palliate your faults, and wipe away the wrongs which you have done me? me, I ſay, not ſickle as your ſelfe is, who have more reaſon to be aſhamed of your changing then I have to be vexed at it: But that which moſt vexeth me, is, that you ſhould charge me with your own faults, and counterfeit a good occaſion for your own infidelity: But 'tis no matter, he that will deceive his own Brother, may well deceive her that is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to him. And then turning towards me, And you <hi>Aſtrea</hi> (ſaid ſhe unto me) you that have ſtollen away the heart of a Servant from me; do you think to keep it any longer then the firſt new object that ſhall preſent it ſelfe' No, no, though I know your perfections have power enough to keep any heart, but ſuch a one as is compos'd of feathers, and has wings to flie away; yet, this light Butterflie will give you the ſlip. <hi>Phillis,</hi> replied I, you talk of ſome perfections that ſhould be in me, but certainly they are much inferiour unto yours, ſince they are not able to hold <hi>Celadon</hi> from you. <hi>Celadon</hi> had now a little recollected himſelf, and kneeling down, he ſaid unto me, It is not, my <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> to undervalue the merits of <hi>Phillis,</hi> that I make theſe moſt ſolemn vowes before all the moſt ſacred gods, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you, that ſhe did never kindle the leaſt ſpark of love in my ſoul; and the wrong you have done me in changing, is not greater, then your taxing my pure affection with incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy. The ſtory would be too tedious (ſage <hi>Diana)</hi> ſhould I trouble you with every particular of our diſcourſe: But ſo it was, that before we parted, we were all ſo well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in our ſenſes again, that all of us did acknowledge, that we had no reaſon to ſuſpect one another, and gave thanks unto heaven, for this happy meeting all together, without which, I believe, the roots of jealouſie had never been eradicated. As for my part, I think
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53526:30"/>
it was impoſſible ever to have brought me to reaſon, had I not heard <hi>Celadon</hi> declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo Ingenuouſly before the face of <hi>Phillis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this, we were more diſcret: but I no ſooner got rid of this diſtemper, then I entred into another no leſſe daingerous: for we could not ſo well diſguiſe the buſineſſe; but <hi>Alcip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes</hi> had a jealouſie that the ſparkes of his Sons affection were not quit extinguiſhed, and had ſuch a curious eye over all his actions, as obſerving how <hi>Celadon</hi> went every day to the place where we were wont to lay our Letters, he himſelfe went thither, and obſerving how the graſſe was troden by our often going thither, a kind of tract did lead him to the very place where I had put a Letter for <hi>Celadon</hi> the night before: it contained theſe words.</p>

But ſuch is my devotion to you, that even divine things themſelves without, you are diſpleaſing to me.

Receive therefore this only as a teſtimony that I will for ever keep all my promiſes to you.</hi>

                  <hi>Alcippes</hi> yet knew not who the ſhepherdeſſe was, unto whom this Letter was intended, for it named none: but ſee what a ſpirit of contradiction will do; he waited at the leaſt ſix or ſeaven houres longer in expectation of her, who was to fetch this Letter, aſſuring himſelfe that it would be before night. It was very late before I came thither: as ſoon as he eſpied me, for feare I ſhould not take the Letter, he lay him down as if he were a ſleep; and I to avoid all ſuſpition, turned back and took another way: He, well ſatisfied with his paines, as ſoon as I was gone, did take the Letter and went home, from whence he intended to ſend his ſon immediatly: becauſe he would not upon any tearms, there ſhould be any alliance betwixt us; by reaſon of the deadly emnity that had been betwixt <hi>Alces</hi> and him; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary intended to marry him unto <hi>Malthea</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Forelle;</hi> To whoſe houſe he ſent him During this ſeperation, <hi>Olimpia,</hi> daughter unto the Shepheard <hi>Lupeander,</hi> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the confines of <hi>Forreſt,</hi> towards the River of <hi>Furan,</hi> came with her Mother un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Town. This good old woman, did Love <hi>Amarillis</hi> very well, being brought up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from the cradle, and therefore came to viſit her. This young ſhepheardeſſe was not ſo fair as affected, and entertained ſo good a conceit of her ſelf, as ſhe thought that all the ſhepheards which ever looked upon her were in Love with her. And therefore, as ſoon as ſhe came into the houſe of <hi>Alcippe,</hi> ſhe began to buſie her ſelfe with <hi>Lycidas,</hi> having an opinion, that the cruelties which he had uſed towards her proceeded from Love: which as ſoone as <hi>Lycidas</hi> perceived, he came to ask our advice, how he ſhould behave himſelf: And we counſelled him to cheriſh this conceit in <hi>Olimpia,</hi> to the end he might the better umbrage his affection unto <hi>Phillis.</hi> And a little after, as ill luck was, it happned, that <hi>Artemis</hi> had ſome buſineſſe cloſe by the River <hi>Allier,</hi> and, do what we could, ſhe carried <hi>Phillis</hi> with her.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53526:30"/>
During this ſeparation which was ſixe or ſeaven Monthes, the Mother of <hi>Olimpia</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned and left her Daughter with <hi>Amarillis,</hi> in hopes that <hi>Lycidas</hi> would Marry her, becauſe for ought ſhe could ſee, he loved her very well. And being an advantageous March for her, the Mother adviſed her, to trim her ſelfe up in as amarous a dreſſe as poſſibly ſhe could: and I aſſure you, Fair <hi>Diana,</hi> ſhe did trick up her ſelfe accordingly, and did court more then ſhe was courted, by much. One day, when he was gone into the woods to ſeeke a ſtrayed ſheep, ſhe met with her beloved ſhepheard: and after ſome common diſcourſe, ſhe laid her armes in a loving poſture upon his ſhoulders, and after ſhe had kiſſed him, thus ſaid Dear ſhepheard, what diſpleaſing qualities are in me, that I ſhould never find the leaſt demonſtration of favour from you? The reaſon is, anſwered he and ſmiled becauſe my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is not worth the having: Should thoſe words proceed from any but your ſelfe, ſaid ſhe, I would ſay the ſpeaker either wanted judgment or was blind. But dear ſhepherd how muſt I Love you, before I obtaine the bliſſe of being loved againe? How many dayes muſt I ſpend in courting you, before I find a returne? I beleeve thoſe ſhepheardeſſes who have the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of your addreſſes, are not more amiable then my ſelfe, nor have any advantages above me, unleſſe in the enjoyment of your favour. <hi>Olimpia</hi> uttered theſe words with ſo much zealous paſſion, that <hi>Lycidas</hi> was ſtartled: and, Fair <hi>Diana,</hi> as oft as I think upon this paſſage I cannot chuſe but laugh, unleſſe my ſad diſaſter forbid it. But however, <hi>Phillis</hi> had commanded him to counterfeit Love of this <hi>Olimpia,</hi> who thinking his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to be in good earneſt, became ever ſince his ſcorne; and having made ſo much uſe of her as ſerved his own turn, he fell to ſuch a diſdaining of her, as that he could not endure to come nigh her. But afterwards he came unto me with ſo many ſignes of diſcontent, as I was perſwaded that he did repent of his foolery: but preſently after, <hi>Olimpia</hi> proved to have a bigge bellie, and when ſhe began to perceive it, <hi>Phillis</hi> returned from her Journey: and as I expected her with much impatience, ſo I received her with abundance of joy. But as it is ordinary for one to enquire of that which lyeth neareſt the heart, ſo <hi>Phillis</hi> after the firſt Salute, asked me how <hi>Lycidas</hi> did, and how he had behaved himſelfe towards <hi>Olimpia?</hi> Very well, anſwered I, and I am ſure it will not be long before he make his appearance. I did cut off this diſcourſe as ſoon as I could, leſt I ſhould ſay ſomthing which might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice <hi>Lycidas,</hi> who for his part was not in a little perplexitie, not knowing how to accoſt his ſhepheardeſſe: but at laſt, reſolving to endure any torment rather then a baniſhment from her preſence, he came unto her lodging, where he knew to find me. And when <hi>Phillis</hi> ſaw him, ſhe runnes with open armes to ſalute him. But he retreating, thus ſaid unto her, Fair <hi>Phillis,</hi> I have not ſo much boldneſſe as to come neer you, unleſſe you will firſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don a fault which I have committed. The ſhepheardeſſe, thinking he meant his comming no ſooner, thus anſwered; There's nothing ſhall debarre me from the Salute of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and though his crimes were more then they are, yet I would pardon them all. Upon this word, ſhe went unto him and ſaluted him with abundance of affection. But her joyes were a little quelled, when he addreſſed himſelfe unto me, and deſired me to accquaint his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſſe with his fault, that he might know unto what puniſhment ſhe would condenme him: Not, ſaid he, but that my ſorrowes for offending her ſhall accompany me to my grave, but becauſe I would know my ſentence. This word made colour come into the face of <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> beleeving now, that the matter was of more moment then ſhe expected. Of which <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas</hi> taking notice, Ah, fair one, ſaid he, I have not courage enough to hear your condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But pardon, fair Miſtriſs, if I leave you; if my life diſpleaſe you, &amp; my death will ſatisfie for my crime, then let me live no longer. At this word he went away, and though <hi>Phillis</hi> called him back, yet he would not returne, but pulled to the dore after him, and left us two alone. You may imagine it was not long before <hi>Phillis</hi> enquired what the matter was, &amp; why he was in ſuch a perplexity and without any long prologue, I acquainted her, laying all the fault on our ſelves, who were ſo much unadviſed as not to foreſee that it was a piece of difficulty for ſuch a young man to reſiſt ſuch a temptation, alſo hinting unto her that the ſin was not of ſo horrid a degree, as to be impardonable. At the firſt I could not mollifie her implacabilitie; nor obtaine the pardon which I deſired: but a few dayes after, <hi>Lycidas</hi> by my advice came, and threw himſelfe at her feet; and becauſe ſhe would not look upon him, ſhe ran into another chamber, and out of that into another, ſtill flying from <hi>Lycidas</hi> who ſtill followed her, and was reſolved never to leave her, untill he had obtained either his pardon or his death. At laſt, when she could go no further, ſhe ſtayed in her cloſet, where <hi>Lycidas</hi> entring and ſhutting the dores after him, he fell down at her feet ſpeaking not one word, but expecting her ſentence. But the importunity of this affectionate begger was more
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53526:31"/>
prevalent, then all my perſwaſions: For, after ſhe had a long time been there, and not a ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable proceeded from either of them, at laſt ſhe ſaid thus, Go, go, troubleſome man, it is thy importunity and not thy ſelfe, that has obtained a pardon. Upon this bleſſed word he did riſe, and kiſs'd her hand, then came and opened the dore, to ſhew me that he had got the victory; then was he in as good a condition as ever, and his Shepheardeſſe did ſo fully pardon him, as ſeeing him much troubled to conceal the big belly of <hi>Olympia,</hi> who now did ſwell ſo, as it was viſible to the eye, ſhe her ſelf went to viſit and aſſiſt her all that poſſibly ſhe could. This indeed (ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> and interrupted) is a moſt ſtrange teſtimony of affection; this, <hi>Phillis,</hi> was too much; and I muſt confeſſe my courage could never have brooked it. By this you may judge at the height of my affection, ſaid <hi>Phillis.</hi> It was rather a fault, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> then ſuperabundance of Love, to pardon ſo eaſily an injury done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lawes of Love. Oh <hi>Diana,</hi> ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> you know better how to make others love you, then how to love. If ſo, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> I am more obliged unto Heaven for it, then for my life. But however, am I not able to judge of love, unleſſe I love my ſelfe? No, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> you cannot be a competent judge; for otherwiſe you will be of too hard a temper, and cannot pardon as love requires: For Love, if it be rightly in tune, reſembles Muſick conſiſting of ſeverall parts, which, if all be well tuned, makes a melodious harmony; but, if one part diſcord, then all is harſh: So, cruell <hi>Diana,</hi> perhaps you will ſay, that after one hath gon through a long and pleaſing ſervice, the firſt offence will ſpoile all the former ſervices. 'Tis very true (ſaid <hi>Diana).</hi> Oh heavens! (cryed out <hi>Phillis)</hi> what a hard task hath he who loves you? He who loves me, replyed <hi>Diana,</hi> muſt take heed he never offends me in matter of affection; and believe me, <hi>Phillis,</hi> you have done <hi>Lycidas</hi> more injury than he hath done you. Then ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> and laughed, heretofore I ſaid, that it was love that prompted me unto this act, but hereafter I will ſay, it was revenge; and to ſuch as are the moſt curious, I will ſay, it was for ſuch a reaſon as I learned of you. They will judge, added <hi>Diana,</hi> that heretofore you did love; and now, that you know what it is to love. However, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> if it be a fault, it proceeds from ignorance, and not from any defect in Love, for I think my ſelfe obliged unto it; but you that have been ſo long mute, I pray tell us, how I aſſiſted to bring this child into the world. Then <hi>Aſtrea</hi> replied thus:</p>
               <p>Aſſoon as this Shepheardeſſe declared her ſelfe, <hi>Lycidas</hi> did very confidently accept of her offer, and ſent a young Shepheard unto <hi>Moin,</hi> to bring a Midwife from thence, with her eyes blinded, that ſhe might not know whither ſhe went. <hi>Diana</hi> then, as being aſtoniſhed, did put her finger to her mouth, and ſaid, Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe, this is not ſuch a ſecret as you imagine, for I remember I have heard of it. I beſeech you, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> tell us how you heard it, that we may ſee how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports do jump. I cannot tell, added <hi>Diana,</hi> whether or no I do well remember it: the poor <hi>Philander</hi> was the relator, and aſſured me, that he had it from <hi>Lucina</hi> a Midwife. One day as ſhe was walking in the Park, betwixt mount <hi>Briſon</hi> and <hi>Moin,</hi> with ſeverall of her companions, a young man came unto her, whom ſhe knew not, and at firſt brought ſome commendations to her from ſome of her friends who were at <hi>Feurs,</hi> and afterwards told her ſome particulars, purpoſely to draw her from the reſt of her company, and when he had her alone, he told her, that a better occaſion brought him thither, and it was, that for all pitties ſake ſhe would go and help an honeſt woman, who, without her aid, was in very great danger. The good woman was a little ſurpriſed at this, but the young man conjured her to conceale her wonder, for he would rather chuſe a death, then this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhould ever be ſuſpected. <hi>Lucina</hi> being now a little better aſſured, and promiſing ſhe would be ſecret, ſhe asked him the time when ſhe ſhould be ready. Prepare your ſelfe, ſaid the young man, for a voyage of two months; and to the end you may be no loſer by the bargain, here is as much mony as you can get any where elſe in that time. Then he gave her ſome pieces of gold in a paper, and asked her if ſhe would go in the night: And the woman finding her wages to be very good, did anſwer him, that ſhe would go at what time he pleaſed. About fifteen or ſixteen daies after, as ſhe was comming out of <hi>Moin,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five or ſix of the clock in the evening, ſhe ſaw him return, with his face quite alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and coming to her, he ſaid, Mother, the time is come, we muſt depart, the horſes are ready, and neceſſitie requires haſte: She would have gone into her houſe to have taken or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der about ſome buſineſſe, but he would not let her, leſt ſhe ſhould tell any: So going into a little private bottom, cloſe by the way ſide, ſhe ſaw two horſes, and a handſome man in black cloths, who kept them: Aſſoon as this man ſaw <hi>Lucina,</hi> he came to meet her with a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53526:31"/>
ſmiling face, and after many thanks, he ſet her on horſeback behinde him who fetched her; then getting upon another horſe, they ſet forward through the fields a good pace; and when they were got a little off the Towne, and night grew dark, this young man pulled a handkercher out of his pocket, and do what <hi>Lucina</hi> could, he blindfolded her: Then afterwards turning the horſe halfe a ſcore times round, to the end ſhe ſhould not know which way they took, they travelled a good part of the night, ſhe not knowing which way they carried her, unleſſe as ſhe thought over a River two or three times; then cauſing her to alight ſhe walked a while on foot, and as ſhe could gueſſe, through a Wood, where ſhe got a glimpſe of light through the handkerchieffe, which preſently after they untied, and then ſhe found her ſelfe in a very fine Tent, hung with Tapeſtry, and made ſo cloſe, as no winde could come in; on the one ſide ſhe ſaw a handſome young woman lying in a little field bed groaning and crying out very loud, but masked; at the beds feet ſhe ſaw another woman masked alſo, who by her habit ſeemed to be well in years, and held up her hands, with tears in her eyes; on the other ſide ſhe ſaw a young Chamber maid masked, holding a candle in her hand: At this Tent dore, ſtood the man who held the horſes, grieving much for the pain this woman was in; and the other man, behind whom ſhe rid, did fetch all things that was neceſſary. You may eaſily imagine how much <hi>Lucina</hi> was amazed at all this; for it is to be thought, that this young woman thus in pain was in Labour, and it was not long before ſhe was delivered of a Daughter; ſo as ſhe being well brought to bed, and the Child put into a Cradle, <hi>Lucina's</hi> eyes were again blinded, and after a full reward for her pains, ſhe was carried the ſame way ſhe came: And all this I received from <hi>Philander. Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> harkened unto this tale very attentively, and <hi>Phillis</hi> could not chuſe but laugh, which <hi>Diana</hi> ſeeing, asked her the reaſon: It is, ſaid ſhe, becauſe you have told us a ſtory which we are altogether ignorant of; and for my part, I cannot imagine who this ſhould be, for it cannot be <hi>Olympia,</hi> but muſt of neceſſitie be ſome other Shephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe. Truly, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> then I was miſtaken; I took that handſom man who held the horſes for <hi>Lycidas;</hi> that old woman, for the Mother of <hi>Celadon;</hi> and the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid for you; and imagined that you were all masked, becauſe you would paſſe unknown. I aſſure you (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea)</hi> it was not <hi>Olympia;</hi> for <hi>Phillis</hi> uſed no other artifice, but only to get <hi>Lucina</hi> unto her houſe, for, as fortune was, <hi>Artemis</hi> was then from home: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Olympia</hi> was with <hi>Amarillis,</hi> ſhe was to faigne her ſelfe ſick, which, as the caſe was with her, ſhe might eaſily do, and deſire ſome change of aire; ſo ſhe was to come unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> who would be glad of her company: <hi>Amarillis</hi> yielded to the deſire, and ſo <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> came to fetch here And when her time drew neer, <hi>Lycidas</hi> got the Midwife and blinded her eyes, that ſhe might be ignorant which way ſhe went; but when ſhe was come to the houſe, her eyes was then at liberty; nor was <hi>Olympia</hi> or any masked, imagining that the Midwife could not know any of their faces. This was all the artifice that was uſed; and when <hi>Olympia</hi> was well again, ſhe returned home: Alſo we have been told ſince, that ſhe uſed a very fine device, for the bringing up of the child: She hired a woman to ſay that it was hers, and then to lay it to the charge of a young fellow who ſerved her Mother; and becauſe the fellow was altogether innocent, he denyed it; but was ſo aſhamed, that he ran away: The woman purſued even unto <hi>Lupeander's</hi> Chamber, and there, though the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſtill refuſed it, ſhe ſet the child down in the midſt of the room, and ran her waies. They ſay, that <hi>Lupeander</hi> was very angry, and <hi>Olympia</hi> alſo at this fellow. But, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion was, <hi>Olympia</hi> turning towards her Mother, However, ſaid ſhe unto her, this child muſt not be loſt, it muſt not be puniſhed for the fault of another; but it will be an act of charity to ſee it brought up: Her Mother, who was of a good and charitable diſpoſition, conſented unto it. And thus <hi>Olympia</hi> got her Daughter to be in the houſe with her.</p>
               <p>All this while <hi>Celadon</hi> was with <hi>Forella,</hi> and entertained with all poſſible welcomes; and <hi>Malthea,</hi> at her Fathers command, did curraſſe him as much as ſhe in civilitie, could. But <hi>Celadon</hi> was ſo diſpleaſed at this ſeparation from us; that all theſe ſweets yielded him but a bitter reliſh; and he lived in ſuch a drooping way, as <hi>Forella</hi> being very angry, that his Daughter ſhould be ſo ſlighted did acquaint <hi>Alcippe</hi> with it, to the end he ſhould not expect any further progreſſe in that match: who knowing the reſolution of his ſon, and, as I think, moved unto ſome pitty, he reſolved once more to uſe ſome other artifice; and after that, never to trouble him any more. Then, whilſt <hi>Celadon</hi> was with <hi>Malthea, Phocion</hi> my Uncle, ſo contrived it, that <hi>Corebes,</hi> a very rich and honeſt Shepheard, ſhould apply himſelfe unto me: And ſince he had all the good qualities that were deſirable, it was already ſo divulged, as if the Wedding were reſolved upon. <hi>Alcippes</hi> thinking to make
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53526:32"/>
uſe of this advantage, deviſed this trick, which I ſhall relate. There was a Shepheard cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Squilinder,</hi> dwelling upon the borders of the Forreſt, in a Town called <hi>Argentall,</hi> a craftie fellow, and very perfidious, who, amongſt the reſt of his knaviſh qualities, had this, that he could counterfeit any hand ſo exactly, as the writer of the Originall could not know it from his Copy. To this man <hi>Alcippe's</hi> ſhewed that Letter of mine which he found, as I told you before, and writ another unto <hi>Celadon</hi> in my name, which was thus indited.</p>

               <p>This Letter was cunningly conveyed unto <hi>Celadon</hi> by an unknown meſſenger. Oh! how his heart was ſunk, when he received this ſad newes: Now <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> (did he ſay) I ſee there is nothing in this world that is durable, ſince all thoſe vowed reſolutions betwixt us are ſo ſoon vaniſhed. Now I am a ſad witneſſe, that all women, be they never ſo full of perfections, can eaſily return to their naturall inconſtancy. Now, life end, ſince <hi>Aſtrea</hi> has loſt her affection, and ſince I can do nothing elſe, but grieve for my great diſaſter. Thus did he breathe out abundance of ſad complaints, and he was the ſooner perſwaded to believe ſuch a change in me might be, by the common reports of my marriage unto <hi>Corebes.</hi> He lay all the day upon his bed, and when night came, he ſtole out of all company, and got into a thick unfrequented wood, ſhunning all ſociety like a ſalvage, and reſolved never to come into any company again.</p>
               <p>In this deſperate reſolution, he wandered over all the Mountains of <hi>Forreſts,</hi> and at laſt found out a deſart unfrequented place, where he intended to finiſh the remainder of his diſmall daies. The place was called <hi>Lapan,</hi> from whence the fatall <hi>Lignon</hi> hath his Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall: Upon the banks of this Spring, he built himſelfe a little Cabin, where he made a ſhift to live above ſix Months; during which time, his ordinary food was tears and ſighs: And his ſolitude had continued longer, had not <hi>Alcippes</hi> commanded <hi>Lycidas</hi> to go and look him out, reſolving (ſince all was in vain) never to croſſe his affection more: But <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas</hi> had look'd long enough before he had found him, but for one accident which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that day.</p>
               <p>I chanced to be then by the banks of <hi>Lignon,</hi> looking upon the water, and condoling the loſſe of <hi>Celadon; Phillis</hi> and <hi>Lycidas</hi> looked alſo in the water as well as I, and we obſerved ſomthing which ſwimmed down the ſtream; <hi>Lycidas,</hi> to ſatisfie the curioſity of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, who much deſired to know what it was, did ſtep into the River, and with a bough brought it out; and finding it to be only a piece of paper, he threw it away upon the ground, being angry he had taken ſo much pains for a thing of no more value: <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſhe took it up, and opening it, we read theſe words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Go thou poor piece of paper, more happy than he that ſends thee; go and view thoſe banks where my Shepheardeſſe uſeth to walk: and if, being accompanied with thoſe tears where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I ſwell this River, thou ſhalt chance to kiſſe the ſhore where the prints of her feet are, ſtay there where my miſerable fate will not ſuffer me to be: If it be thy chance to come into thoſe hands, which have rob'd me of my heart, and ſhe ſhall ask thee what I do, tell her, faithfull paper, that I am night and day waſhing away her infidelity with my tears; and if thou doſt move her to ſo much repentance, as to drop a tear upon thee, tell her of the ſin ſhe hath committed againſt her own faith and my affection; and that my ſorrowes are witneſſes both before men and gods, that ſhe is both the faireſt and the moſt perfidious woman upon earth; and alſo, that I am the moſt faithfull, and the moſt affectionate adorer of her that ever lived, with this aſſurance, that I ſhall never enjoy any contentment, but in death.</hi>

this was the cauſe of <hi>Lycidas</hi> his gazing up the water to look for him: and he uſed ſuch diligence that in two or three dayes he found him out in his ſolitary habitation, ſo much unlike what he was, that he was not knowable: But when <hi>Lycidas</hi> told him that he muſt come to me, and that I did ſo command it; he could hardly be perſwaded but that his Brother would deceive him. At laſt, the Letter which he gave him from me did ſo revive him that in a few dayes he cheered up his countenance, and came unto us, yet not ſo ſoon but <hi>Alcippes:</hi> dyed before his return, and <hi>Amarillis</hi> followed him, a few dayes after. Then had we ſome hopes that fortune had ſhot her worſt arrowes againſt us, ſince they two who did moſt croſſe our deſignes were dead, but it did not ſo happen: for the buſineſſe of <hi>Corebes</hi> ſo continued, that <hi>Alces, Hippolita</hi> and <hi>Phocion</hi> did much trouble my tranquillity; and yet our miſery did not proceed from them, though <hi>Corebes</hi> was partly the cauſe of it: for when he came to make his addreſſes to me, being very rich, he brought many ſhepheards with him, amongſt which was <hi>Semires;</hi> a ſhepheard truly of many excellent qualities, but the moſt falſe and cunning man that ever lived: as ſoon as ever he ſaw me, his deſigne was to ſerve me, not valuing the friendſhip twixt <hi>Corebes</hi> and him and ſince <hi>Celadon</hi> and I had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to diſſemble it, the better to colour our loves, he to ſeeme as if he loved all ſhephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes, and I to admit patiently of all addreſſes to me, he preſently did think that my good reception of him did proceed from ſome good affection to him. But he had not ſo ſoon knowne of the affection betwixt <hi>Celodon</hi> and me, had he not by ill luck found ſome of my Letters: Now though all knew that he loved me, yet few beleeved that I loved him, ſo cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did I carry my ſelfe towards him: and becauſe <hi>Alcippes</hi> had found our Letters which had coſt us ſo dear, we would not truſt them that way any longer but invented another trick which we thought more ſafe. <hi>Celadon</hi> was wont to have a hole in the lining of his hat, in which he uſed to put ſuch Letters as he writ unto me, then he would throw it at me in a jeſting manner, or elſe leave it by me, that I might take it out, and returne mine the ſame way back againe: I know not how, but one day as ill luck was, I let fall one of my Letters, and <hi>Semires</hi> took it up; which when he read, he found theſe lines.</p>

               <p>After he had found this Letter, his thoughts were not ſo much of Love as how to make <hi>Celadon</hi> and me at odds, and he began thus. In the firſt place, he beſeeched me to pardon him for being ſo bold, as to lift up his eyes ſo high, as upon me, whoſe beauty had conſtrained him unto it: &amp; that he was ſo conſcious of his own ſmal merits, that he would never trouble me any more, only beſeeched me to forget his raſh attempt: afterwards he did ſo much court the friendſhip and familiarity of <hi>Celadon,</hi> as if he had loved him above all the men in the world: And the more to blind me lie never met me, but took an occaſion to ſpeak very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly of my ſhepheard, covering his intentions with ſuch a ſubtile cloak, that none could imagine he had a deſigne it it; his commends of the perſon whom I loved, did, as I ſaid before, ſo deceive me that I took great delight in talking with him: &amp; thus two or three Monthes paſſed very happily both for <hi>Celadon</hi> and me. But I think it was to make me the more: ſenſible of of my enſuing miſery, which I ſhall never remember but with warry eyes: here ſhe ſtopped and in lieu of words, did by her tears repreſent her ſorrowes unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that neither ſhe nor they durſt open their mouthes fearing to augment her teares: for the more one thinkes to ſtop the current of teares by reaſon, the more they will flow. At laſt ſhe began to purſue her former diſcourſe: Alas, wiſe <hi>Diana,</hi> ſaid ſhe, I cannot remember this fatall diſaſter without a tribute of ſad teares, <hi>Semires</hi> now had gotten ſuch familiarity both with <hi>Celadon</hi> and me, as we were ſeldome aſunder. And when he thought he had ſufficiently inſinuated himſelfe into credence, and thought he could perſwade me to what he would, one day after we had long talked of ſeverall infidelities, which ſhepheards
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53526:33"/>
uſed towards ſhepherdeſſes whom they faigned to Love. I wonder ſaid he, that ſo few ſhepherdeſſes ſhould take warning by ſo many examples, though otherwiſe they are very diſcreet and wiſe. The reaſon is, anſwered I, becauſe Love hath blinded their eyes: 'Faith I think ſo, replied he, for otherwiſe it is impoſſible but you ſhould ſee ſomthing which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes your ſelf. Then holding his peace, and ſeeming as if he could ſay more, but repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of what he had ſaid, <hi>Semires, Semires,</hi> (ſaid he, turning his back) what doſt thou do? Doſt thou not ſee that ſhe will be diſpleaſed at the knowledge of it? Why wilt thou then torment her? And then addreſſing himſelf unto me, he went on: I ſee, fair <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that my talk had like to have diſpleaſed you, but pardon me I beſeech you, ſince it was only my zeal to your ſervice, that I ſaid ſo much: <hi>Semires,</hi> ſaid I unto him, I am much obliged to you for your good will to me, and ſhould be much more if you would finiſh that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which you begun: Oh ſhepheardeſſe, (anſwered he) I doubt I have ſaid too much already, but perhaps time will tell you more, and then you will know <hi>Semires</hi> to be your faithfull ſervant. Oh deceitfull man, how good did he make his wicked promiſes unto me? For ſince that I have known but too much, to know it with any deſire of living: at that time he would tell me no more, purpoſely to whet my deſire of knowing it: but when he thought that my deſire was now eager enough, &amp; after I had very importunately urged him to tell it, he anſwered me thus. Fair ſhepheardeſſe, you ſeem to be ſo very deſirous, that I ſhould think it a fault in me if I did diſobey you: but truly, I am much afraid it will more diſpleaſe you. Then after I had aſſured him there was nothing could much diſpleaſe her, he knew ſo well how to perſwade me that <hi>Celadon</hi> loved <hi>Aminthea</hi> Daughter unto the Sonne of <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> that jealouſy, the uſuall companion of all Soules who Love truly, began to make me think this might be true, forgetting the command which I had impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him, to faine all love unto all ſhepheardeſſes. However, to diſguiſe my diſpleaſure, I anſwered <hi>Semires</hi> that I never did nor would beleeve, <hi>Celadon</hi> did more particularly apply himſelf unto me then unto others; and that the familiarity which was between them, was only the conſequent of a long acquaintance: but as for any matters of love, and addreſſes of that nature, that they were altogether indifferent unto me. Then this ſubtile man anſwered me thus, I thank the gods that your humour is ſuch; and ſince it is ſo, you will take ſome delight in hearing ſome of thoſe paſſionate expreſſions, which he beſtowed upon his deare <hi>Aminthea.</hi> I muſt confeſſe, wiſe <hi>Diana,</hi> when I heard <hi>Aminthea</hi> called, his, I changed colour: and becauſe he offered to relate their diſcourſe, I ſeemed willing to heare more of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity of <hi>Celadon,</hi> though alas more faithfull, then I was well adviſed. So I accepted of his offer, and indeed he made good his promiſes. For a little after, he came running unto me, and told me, he had left them together not farre off and that <hi>Celadon's</hi> head did lie in <hi>Amintheas</hi> lap, and ſhe holding his head; relating theſe particulars purpoſely to nettle me the more. Then I followed him, though I neither knew which way I went, nor what I did, until we came very neere, though they neither heard nor ſaw us. I have ſince thought, that it was becauſe they cared not who either ſaw or heard them; but ſo it was, that I heard <hi>Celadon</hi> anſwer her, Beleeve me, fair ſhepheardeſſe, never did beautie make a deeper impreſſion in any ſoul, then it hath in mine: but <hi>Celadon</hi> anſwered <hi>Aminthea,</hi> It is not poſſible a heart ſo young as yours, ſhould long retaine that impreſſion which love hath made in it. Incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſhepheardeſſe, (replyed my <hi>Celadon)</hi> let us leave off theſe reaſons; do not meaſure me by the yard or weights of another: but bleſs me with your favour, and you ſhall ſee whether or no my young heart can preſerve them as long as it lives: <hi>Celadon, Celadon,</hi> replyed <hi>Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea,</hi> you would be but deſervedly puniſhed, if your diſſimulations ſhould become truthes, and if heaven in my revenge ſhould make you love <hi>Aminthea</hi> in earneſt, whom now I know you do but jeaſt with. Hitherto, all was well enough: but Oh heavens what a ſtrange an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of diſſimulation did he returne? Fair ſhepheardeſſe, anſwered he, if I do mock or jeaſt with you, may Love turne all my mockery upon my ſelf, &amp; if I have merited it that he would puniſh me with your menaces. <hi>Aminthea,</hi> not being able to reach the intention of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe did anſwer him only with a ſigh and in ſuch a manner, as I in my language did inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret, that ſhe would not have rejected him, if ſhe could have credited his language. But that which moſt perplexed me, was, that after <hi>Celadon</hi> had been a while ſilent, he fetched a deep ſigh which preſently ſhe anſwered with another: and when he did riſe up to ſpeak unto her ſhe covered her eyes with her hand &amp; bluſht, as being aſhamed that this ſigh had eſcaped her: and after a little pauſing ſilence, <hi>Aminthea</hi> ſaid thus unto him. Come <hi>Celadon,</hi> are you ſo ſoone weary of my company? I rather feare (ſaid he) that I ſhall weary her, whom I extreamly deſire to pleaſe and therefore ſince you command it, I will ſtay. I dare not uſe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53526:33"/>
commands (replied the Shepheardeſſe) where intreaties perhaps will be too indiſcreet. Uſe what termes you pleaſe, replied the Shepheard, but I am much your ſervant. So he ſet himſelfe down, and began thus.</p>

               <p>Fair <hi>Diana,</hi> I was not able to ſtay any longer in this place, but ſtealing gently away, I returned to my flock, ſo ſad, as all that day I could not utter one word, and paſſed away the night with a thouſand ſad conceits, and cryed as long as I had any tears. I do admire I ſhould be ſo blinded; for had I retained the leaſt ſpark of judgment, I ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that it was my command he ſhould faigne love: But the next morning when he came unto me, I gave him ſuch harſh entertainment, as made him deſperate, and cauſed him to throw himſelfe into that gulph, where he and all my joyes were drowned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>At this word ſhe looked as pale as death, and had not <hi>Phillis</hi> revived her, taking her into her armes, ſhe had ſwouned.</p>
               <p>The noiſe which they made at <hi>Aſtrea's</hi> ſwouning was ſo great, that <hi>Leonida</hi> waked, and hearing ſome talk ſo neer her, her curioſity invited her to know who they were. And becauſe theſe three Shepheardeſſes were riſen up to go away, all ſhe could do was to wake <hi>Silvia,</hi> to ſhew them unto her. Aſſoon as ſhe ſaw them, ſhe knew <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> though the diſaſter of <hi>Celadon</hi> had much altered her. <hi>Leonida</hi> asked her, who were the other two? The one of them, ſaid ſhe, who is on the left hand, is <hi>Phillis,</hi> her deer companion; and the other is <hi>Diana,</hi> daughter to the ſage <hi>Relinda</hi> and <hi>Celion:</hi> I am very ſorry we have ſlept ſo long, for I am confident we ſhould have received ſome newes from them; for it is likely they came into this place ſo far from company, purpoſely to talk with more freedome. I muſt ingenuouſly confeſſe (ſaid <hi>Leonida)</hi> that I never in all my life ſaw any fairer then <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> ſhe has the advantage of all others. Conſider then, ſaid <hi>Silvia,</hi> what hopes <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi> has to divert the affection of this Shepheard from her. This conſideration did touch <hi>Leonida</hi> ſo to the quick, that ſhe did reſent it more for her own cauſe than <hi>Galathea's:</hi> However, Love, which never leaves a Lover without ſome ſweet hopes, would not treat this Nymph worſe then others; and therefore, though with ſmall probability, yet, ſhe promiſed her ſelfe thus much hope, that, perhaps abſence from <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> together with her own kindneſſe, mightwork an alteration in him. Then, after ſome other ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, theſe two Nymphs parted, <hi>Leonida</hi> towards <hi>Feurs,</hi> and <hi>Silvia</hi> towards <hi>Iſoures,</hi> whilſt the three Shepheardeſſes retired to their Cabins.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had they ſet foot in the great meadow, where of late they uſed to meet, but they eſpied <hi>Lycidas</hi> talking with <hi>Silvander;</hi> yet, aſſoon as ever this Shepheard ſaw <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> he grew ſo pale and altered, that leaſt <hi>Silvander</hi> ſhould take notice of it, he broke from him with a hollow excuſe; but ſtriving to avoid meeting with them, <hi>Phillis</hi> with <hi>Diana</hi> croſſed the way to overtake him, and when ſhe came at him, ſhe ſaid unto him, If you thus flie your friends, <hi>Lycidas,</hi> what would you do to your enemies? The company you keep ſo much, <hi>Phillis,</hi> anſwered he, does not deſerve the title of friend. She whom you ſo much complain of (anſwered <hi>Phillis)</hi> does endure more torment for her offending of you, then you your ſelfe doth. There is no way to cure the wound (anſwered the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard) but by breaking the weapon which gave it. By this time <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was come up, who addreſſed her ſelfe unto <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and ſaid unto him, I am ſo far, <hi>Lycidas,</hi> from thinking your hatred of me unjuſt, as I muſt confeſſe, you cannot hate me ſo much as you have cauſe for; yet, if the memory of him, who cauſeth me to give you this ſad ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be yet as freſh in your minde, as it is, and ever ſhall be, in mine, you will alſo remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that I was ſhe whom he loved above all the world. <hi>Lycidas</hi> would have anſwered, and perhaps, according to his paſſion, very ſharply; but <hi>Diana</hi> ſtopped his mouth with her hand, and ſaid, <hi>Lycidas, Lycidas,</hi> if you do not accept of this ſatisfaction, both I, and all the world, will ſay, you are unreaſonable. <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> not inſiſting upon what <hi>Diana</hi> ſaid, and taking away her hand from before his mouth, ſhe ſaid, No, no, wiſe Shepheardeſſe, do not conſtrain <hi>Lycidas,</hi> let him uſe all the harſh language he pleaſth, I know they are
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53526:34"/>
effects of a moſt juſt ſorrow; yet, I know withall, that his loſſe is not greater then mine. <hi>Lycidas</hi> hearing theſe words, and not being able to command himſelfe, he went away: <hi>Phillis</hi> followed, and knew ſo well how to repreſent the griefe of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and the villany of <hi>Semires,</hi> that at laſt ſhe reconciled him to the Company.</p>
               <p>But though <hi>Leonida</hi> made all the haſte ſhe could; yet, becauſe ſhe ſlept ſo long, ſhe could get no further then <hi>Ponſins;</hi> her Hoſt being a very honeſt man, lodged her in the beſt lodging he had: In the next room unto hers, were lodged two other ſtrangers, there being only a thin partition betwixt their two Chambers; ſo as <hi>Leonida</hi> could hear all that they ſaid, and hearkening at the partition, ſhe heard one of them ſay unto the other, What ſhould I ſay more unto you, only, that Love has made you thus impatient. <hi>Leoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> thought ſhe ſhould know the voice, but ſhe could not well remember it, untill the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpake, ſaying, But that, <hi>Climanthes,</hi> is not it which troubles me; for, the attempt ſhall never ſo much diſmay me, but I will ſtill hope for a good iſſue of our Enterpriſe. That which I moſt fear, and which makes me fit upon ſuch thornes, as you ſee me, is, that you have not made her well underſtand what we have determined to do, or elſe, that ſhe does not give any credit unto your words. <hi>Leonida</hi> hearing this diſcourſe, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very well who it was which ſpoke, being both amuzed, and deſirous to know more, ſhe ſetled her ſelfe ſo neer the partition, that ſhe loſt not a word of what was ſpoken: And then ſhe heard <hi>Climanthes</hi> ſay, I have oft told you, that the buſineſſe is impoſſible. Yes, ſaid the other, only in your judgment. Truly, anſwered <hi>Climanthes,</hi> to make you confeſſe it, and to eaſe you of your pain, I will once more make you a repetition of the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe.

               <p>AFter we were all parted, and you had by your diſcourſe made me acquainted with <hi>Galathea, Silvia, Leonida,</hi> and all the Nymphs of <hi>Amaſis,</hi> as afterwards you did by a ſight of them, I conceived, that the next principall thing which might further our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, was, to know how <hi>Lindamor</hi> was habited the day of his departure: For, you know, that <hi>Clidaman</hi> and <hi>Guyamant</hi> being gone into <hi>Merovea, Amaſis</hi> commanded <hi>Lindamor</hi> to follow him, with all the brave Cavaliers of this Country, to the end that <hi>Clidaman</hi> might appear in more luſtre. And it ſeemed, as ill luck was, that <hi>Lindamor</hi> intended to change the Livery of his ſervants; but ſo it was, that I having an obſervant eye of every thing, one night as he was in the ſtreet, I heard him command one of his men to go unto his Taylor, and fetch the Coat that he had made againſt the day of Rendevonz, that he might try how it fitted him: And ſince he had charged the Taylor to let none ſee it, he gave this ſervant a Ring as a token, that he came from his Maſter: I followed the ſervant ſo cloſe, that I knew the lodging and the name of the Taylor: The next morning betimes I went unto him, and told him that I came from <hi>Lindamor,</hi> to ſee in what forwardneſſe his clothes were: for <hi>Amaſis</hi> was ſo preſſing to have him go, and his fears of his cloths not being finiſhed in time, made me come to bring him the certain truth, for he would not truſt him; he would have given his Ring for a token (ſaid I) but he told me, this would be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that I tell you, he ſent laſt night for the Coat, and he who came for it, brought it again. Thus I deceived the Taylor, and took notice of his cloths as well as poſſibly I could. Then I ſeeming to haſten him with his work, he told me, that he had time enough; for, he had ſeen a Letter which <hi>Amaſis</hi> did write unto the Maior of the Town, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to ſummon all the gallantry of the Town againſt ſuch a day, on which <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi> and ſuch as went with him, were to depart. By this means I came to know the day of <hi>Lindamor's</hi> departure; and moreover, then you were in this country, which was an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident that fell out very happily for the furthering our deſigne, which you had already been advertiſed of. In order to this, I retired my ſelfe into the great wood of <hi>Savignieu,</hi> neer a little River which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ns through it; there I erected a little Hut of boughes, ſo cloſe, that many paſſed by never eſpying me; and this I did, that it might be believed I had long dwelt there; for you know, that none in this Country knew me. And to make it ſeem I had long inhabited there, the leaves and boughes which covered my Cabin were all wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered. I decked up a Table with a Looking-glaſſe upon it, ſetround with Ivy, Miſletoe, and Holline, and ſtrewed my room with Ruſhes, Vervin and ſuch like: I ſet my Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſe in the moſt dark part of the room, to the end my Art might not be ſo ſoon diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; and oppoſite to this mirrour, I placed my painted Paper, wherein I had ſo exactly
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53526:34"/>
drawn the place which I intended to ſhew <hi>Galathea,</hi> as none could diſtinguiſh between the Originall and the Copy. Above this glaſſe did hang a plank, upon which an ugly grim viſage was painted, and hanged by a ſmall thred, which, with the obſcurity of the place, could not be diſcerned; at the bottom of this plank was fixed a ſteel, which, when the plank fell, the ſteel did hit againſt a piece of flint, purpoſely ſo ſet, as it never failed of fire; about which place I had ſet a compoſure of Sulphure, and Salt-peeter, which, when fire did fall into it, did break into ſtrange kinde of flames, in ſuch a ſtrange manner, and with ſuch celeritie as might well cauſe wonder. All this I invented, that it might be thought either ſome Divinity, or elſe ſome Witchcraft. After all things were thus ordered, I did ſometimes expoſe my ſelfe to ſight, but very ſeldome; and aſſoon as I perceived any ſaw me, I preſently retreated into my Cell, where I made a ſhow, as if I lived only upon roots herbs, and air, though in the night I changed habit, and provided all things neceſſary. Within a few daies many took notice of me, and my fame was ſo great, that it reached the ears of <hi>Amaſis,</hi> who uſed often to come and walk in the Gardens of <hi>Mount-Briſon.</hi> Upon a time, <hi>Sildres, Silvia, Leonida,</hi> and ſeverall others of their company, did walk along the banks of my little River, where then I ſeemed, as if I were gathering ſome herbs: aſſoon as I perceived they ſaw me, I ran haſtily into my Cabin; they being full of curioſity to ſee me, and to talk with me, did come after me through the wood: I, by that time had got upon my knees, and when I ſaw them look through my dore, I went towards it, where the firſt that met me was <hi>Leonida;</hi> and becauſe ſhe had thruſt open the dore, and was ready to enter, I ſharply reprehended her, ſaying, <hi>Leonida,</hi> the Deities whom I adore, does command you not to prophane their Altar. Upon theſe words ſhe was a little ſurprized, and retreated for, my habit of a Druide got me reverence, and my naming (Deitle) did ſtrike with terror: But, aften a little recollection of her ſelfe, ſhe ſaid thus unto me, The Altars of your Deities be they whom they will, cannot be profaned, by receiving my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, which came hither only to render that honour which the heavens demands of us. The heavens indeed (anſwered I) doth expect both devotion and honour, but not diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from ſuch as they ordain. If any zeal to the divinity whom I adore, has brought you hither, then you muſt obſerve what ſhe commands. What is her commandements (ſaid <hi>Silvia)? Silvia,</hi> (ſaid I unto her) if you come with the ſame devotion that your companion doth, then do as I ſhall bid you, and your devotion will be acceptable unto my deitie. Before the Moon does enter into her decreaſe, waſh your right thigh as low as your knee, and your right arm as low as your elbow, before day, in this River, which runs before this ſacred Cave; and afterwards come hither with a Chaplet of Vervine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your head, and a Girdle of Fern about your middle; then ſhall I declare unto you the myſteries of this holy place. Then taking her by the hand, I ſaid thus unto her, Would you have me (for a teſtimony of that favour, which the deities are pleaſed to confer upon me) tell you ſome paſſages of your life paſt, and ſome that are to come? No, not I (ſaid ſhe) for I am not ſo full of curioſity: but you my Companion (ſaid ſhe, and turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Leonida)</hi> I have known you heretofore full of ſuch curioſity. And ſo I am ſtill (ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> and preſented her hand unto me). Then calling to memorie what you told me concerning theſe Nymphs in particular, I took her hand, and asked her, whether ſhe was born in the night, or in the day time; and underſtanding that it was in the night, I took her left hand, and after a conſidering pauſe, I ſaid unto her, <hi>Leonida,</hi> This Line of Life being handſome, well marked, and long, does demonſtrate, that you muſt live long, and free from any corporeall maladies; but this little Croſſe upon the ſame Line, almoſt at the top of the Angle, does portend ſome maladies of Love, which will hinder you from being ſo ſound in minde as in body: and theſe five or ſix little Points, which are ſowed like little grainee here and there, upon the ſame Line, do ſignifie, that you will never hate them that love you, and will much delight in being courted. Then look upon the other Line, which takes its root from that which we ſpoke of before, which paſſing through the midſt of the hand, does raiſe it ſelfe up towards the hill of the Moon, it is called the middle natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Line; Theſe fractions which you ſee and ſeem ſo little, do ſignifie, that you are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly angred, even againſt thoſe, over whom Love has given you authoritie: And this little ſtar which turnes againſt the riſing of the pulſe, doth ſhew, that you are full of goodneſſe and ſweetneſſe, and that your anger is ſoon over. But obſerve that Line which we call the Table Line, which joynes it ſelfe with the middle naturall Line, ſo as both do make an Angle, this doth demonſtrate various troubles in matter of Love, and which will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten render your life very diſpleaſing, and tells me, that it will be very long or never, before
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53526:35"/>
your deſres come to a concluſion. I would have continued, when ſhe pulled back her hand and told me, that this was not that which ſhe did ask of me, but ſhe defired to know what would become of that deſigne which ſhe had in hand, and that I would not ſpeak ſo generally as before, but come to particulars. To which I anſwered, that the Divine powers did keep the future to themſelves, unleſſe ſomtimes out of their goodneſſe they revealed them unto their ſervants and that ſomtimes for the publique good, ſomtimes to ſatisfie the ſervent prayers of thoſe who do often importune them at their Altars: and very often to ſhow that nothing is hid from them; but alwayes unto ſuch as are prudent and diſcreet: for the ſecrets of the gods would not be made common, or divulged, but upon ſpeciall occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I tell you this, that your curioſitie may reſt contented, though I have not ſo clearely diſcovered things unto you, as you deſire. Nor is it either expedient or neceſſary, I ſhould tell you any more: but to the end you may know, that the gods are not niggards of their favours but ſpeak familiarly unto me. I will tell you of ſuch things as have happened unto you, by which you may very well Judge, that I do know them.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, fair Nymph, you know that though I never ſaw you before, yet at the very firſt entrance I called you by your names; which I did, that you might beleeve me to be above the common degree of knowledge, not that I do aſcribe any glory unto my ſelfe, for that would be high preſumption, but unto the gods whom I do adore in this place. Then you beleeve that all I ſay, I learned from my maſter. (And in this I lyed not, for it was you <hi>Polemas</hi> who told me all) But, continued I, particularities will make my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe very long; it were convenient, if we went under ſome of thoſe ſhady trees. Upon this we went, and then I began thus; Truly, <hi>Clemanthes</hi> (ſaid <hi>Polemas</hi> to him and interrupted him) you could not carry out this beginning with more artifice. You ſhall judge, anſwered <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> whether I did not continue it with as much or more prudence: Then thus I began, Fair Nymph, it is now about three yeares ſince the noble <hi>Agis</hi> in a full aſſembly was given unto you for a Servant. At the firſt, you were very indifferent; for then the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripeneſſe of both your ages, had not made you capable of ſuch paſſions as Love did conceive: but ſince that time, your beautie in him, and his addreſſes unto you, did by degrees kindle thoſe ſires which nature at the firſt had laid a foundation for: ſo as that which at the firſt was but indifferent in you both, became now particular; and Love did furniſh his ſoul with all ſuch paſſions as uſually do accompany it: likwiſe you began to bear him ſo much good will as to accept of his affection and ſervices above others. The firſt time he ever made any overtures unto you, was when <hi>Amaſis</hi> did walk in the gardens of <hi>Mount-Briſon,</hi> when he took you by the hand, and after a long pauſe, upon a ſuddain he broke into theſe expreſſions: Fair Nymph I will no longer diſpute with my ſelfe, whether I ſhould or I ſhould not declare, the thoughts of my ſoul unto you, for now my ſoul begins to be angry with me, and conſtraines me to it. Here I ſtopt, and ſaid, unto her; <hi>Leonida,</hi> will you have me repeat the very ſame words to a ſyllable, that you uſed in anſwer to him? Beleeve me, (ſaid <hi>Polemas</hi> them) you run a great hazard to be diſcovered. No no, anſwered <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> and to give a teſtimonie that I have not loſt my memorie, I wil repeat unto you the ſame words: But replyed <hi>Polemas,</hi> perhaps I might either forget or miſtake them: Oh never doubt that (ſaid <hi>Cleanthes)</hi> for I beleeve ſhe herſelf cannot remember her own very words; ſo as having an opinion that I recieved mine from the gods, doubtleſſe ſhe would have beleeved them the ſame, though you had never been familiar with her. But remembring that you ſerved her long, and that your ſervices were alwayes well received untill you changed affection and addreſſed it unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> and upon that reaſon ſhe took part with <hi>Lindamor</hi> againſt you, therefore I ſpoke more confidently of the paſt paſſages, knowing well that Love wil not let a lover conceal any thing from the party loved; but to returne to the purpoſe, ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered me; I ſee you can tell us what you wil, but we can believe what we pleaſe, this ſhe ſaid, as being a little nettled in that which perhaps ſhe would have concealed from her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: however I went on True, <hi>Leonida,</hi> (ſaid I,) you may beleeve what you pleaſe, but I am ſure tell you nothing but what you know is true: you anſwered <hi>Agis,</hi> as if you did not underſtand his meaning, whatſoever it be, <hi>Agis</hi> (ſaid you unto him) out with it: for diſſimulation misbecomes all men, eſpecially ſuch as you. This advice (anſwered he) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether which my own paſſion conſtraines me to tell your Fair Nymph, That the inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my merits compared with yours is not able to ſtop the violence of my affection but if the will of a giver be more to be looked unto, then the quality of the gift, I dare boldly ſay, that mine is not a deſpiſable ſacrifice. For the heart which I do give, I do give it with all the affections, with all the faculties, and with all the power of my ſoul; and this ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53526:35"/>
as hereafter, it is not mine, I do diſavow and renounce it as a thing that does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto me: untowhich you anſwered; <hi>Agis,</hi> I ſhall beleeve theſe words, when time and your ſervices has told as much as your tongue: This, <hi>Leonida,</hi> was the firſt declaration of affection which you received from him, which afterwards he did proſecute with many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes and quarrells which he underwent againſt many when he was jealous. It was now the time, <hi>Leonida,</hi> when you, as you were curling your haire with hot Irons, you burned your cheek, upon which ſubject he compoſed theſe verſes.</p>

               <p>Now, <hi>Leonida,</hi> to make it appear, that I do know al theſe things from a Divinitie who never lies, and whoſe eye and eare does look into the very center of all hearts; I will tell you one thing which none did ever know but your ſelf and <hi>Agis.</hi> She was now afraid, leſt I ſhould diſcover ſome ſecret which would anger her, and indeed it was my deſign to make her have that apprehenſion and therefore with a troubled mind, ſhe ſaid thus unto me; man of God, though I do not fear that you or any other can ſay any thing which will much preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice me, yet the diſcovery of ſecrets is a thing of ſo tender a concernment as be they touched by never ſo gentle a hand, yet it wil annoy: therefore I beſeech you let this diſcourſe have an end; ſhe uttered theſe words with ſo much alteration in her lookes, and in ſuch a faint tone, as to cheere her up, I was forced to ſay thus; you need not think me of ſo ſhallow diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that I know how to conceale any thing which will offend you: and therefore fince you will know no more, I know how to be ſilent; alſo it is time for me to returne to that Divinity who calls me: then I did riſe up, and bad them adieu. Then after I had cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniouſly waſhed my hand in this River, upon my knees, I ſaid, Oh Soveraigne <hi>Dietie</hi> which reſides in this place, behold how in this water I waſh away, and purifie my ſelf from all the prophanitie which the converſation with men might have defiled me withall, ſince I came out of thy holy Temple. At this word, I waſhed my hands, my head, my feet, and all parts over, ſo entred into my cabin, not ſpeaking a word after unto her: and becauſe I did imagine, that their curioſitie would invite them to come and ſee what I did, I went unto my Altar, and kneeling down; I let down, the plank which had the ſteel in it, and which immediatly fell upon the flint, and fired my compoſition. The Nymphs firſt ſeeing my looking glaſſe which caſt a very reſplendent Luſter, and after ſuch a flaming combuſtion upon a ſudden, they returned home with a great opinion of my ſanctitie, and reverence towards the Divinitie whom I adored. Could matters be better executed then
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53526:36"/>
this? No certainly, anſwered <hi>Polemas,</hi> for I believe any one that was not acquainted with it, might have been deceived as well as the Nymphs.</p>
               <p>Whilſt <hi>Climanthes</hi> talked thus, <hi>Leonida</hi> who heard him, was ſo raviſhed out of her ſelfe, as ſhe hardly knew whether ſhe was awake or aſleep, for ſhe found all he related to be very true; and yet ſhe could not well believe that it was ſo: But whilſt ſhe was thus in diſpute with her ſelfe, ſhe heard <hi>Climanthes</hi> begin again thus, Then theſe Nymphs went away, and what reports they made of me, I know not; but I conjecture they talked very highly of me, and ſuch ſtrange things, that all the Court was full of me: for, as fame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies encreaſeth by paſſing from mouth to mouth; ſo an infinite number came to ſee me, ſome out of curioſity, others to know their Fortunes, and many to ſee whether all reports of me were true; ſo as I was put to all my ſhifts for maintaining my reputation. To avoid ſome, I ſaid, that this was a day on which the deitie would not hear nor anſwer; to others I ſaid, that ſome had offended the divinity, and therefore they would give no return, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till I had appeaſed them by faſting; to others, I did preſcribe a long pennance before I could undertake them: And when all was done, I ſaid, they had either done too much, or too little, of that which I did impoſe upon them, and ſo I alwaies gained time: As for ſuch as I knew any thing of their buſineſſe, I diſpatched them readily enough; and that was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why all others, who deſired to know as much as they, did wholly ſubmit unto what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I did impoſe upon them. At the laſt, <hi>Amaſis</hi> her ſelfe came to ſee me, and brought <hi>Galathea</hi> with her; after I had ſatisfied <hi>Amaſis</hi> in all her demands, which in ſum was, whether <hi>Clideman</hi> ſhould be proſperous in his voyage: and I anſwered her, that he ſhould run through much varietie of fortune, that he ſhould be wounded, and that he ſhould be in three Battles with the Princes of <hi>France;</hi> but that at laſt, he ſhould return with much glory; Then ſhe went away well ſatisfied, and deſired me to recommend her ſon unto the tuition of the deitie whom I adored. But <hi>Galathea</hi> much fuller of curioſity then her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, taking me aſide, thus ſaid unto me, Good Father, I beſeech you oblige me ſo far, as to let me know, what Fate I muſt expect. Then I did bid her ſhew me her hand, I looked her in the face, I made two or three circles on the ground, and turned towards the ſame; then I took the meaſure of her hand, of her foot, of her neck, and many other ceremonies did I uſe. At laſt, looking ſtedfaſtly upon her, I ſaid, <hi>Galathea,</hi> You are infinitely happy, if you can but know how to take the advantage of one houre; and you are extreamly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, if either out of careleſſneſſe, or out of love or out of fear, you let this houre ſlip: But, the very truth is, unleſſe you would make your ſelfe uncapable of that happineſſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which the heavens deſtined you, you cannot attain unto greater felicity; all your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, or all your miſery, depends upon Love. Be adviſed therefore, and take a ſtrong reſolution, not to be intangled by the allurements of love; let neither the counſell of Friends, nor command of Parents, ſtagger you; for if you do, then there is none under heaven will be more miſerable then your ſelfe. Oh heavens! (ſaid <hi>Galathea</hi> then) how you amaze me. Nay, never wonder (ſaid I unto her) for this which I tell you is only for your good: and to the end you may carry your ſelfe with more prudence, I will diſcover unto you, as much as the deitie will permit me; but be ſure you keep all I ſhall ſay moſt ſecret, and do not impart it to any upon earth. After ſhe had promiſed me ſo to do, I proceeded on. Daughter (ſaid I) for ſo my divine office allowes me to call you, you ſhall be courted and ſued unto, by many noble Cavaliers, whoſe vertues and merits may haply move you to caſt an eye upon ſome of them: but, if you do meaſure your affection, either by their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, or by their loves, and not by what I ſhall ſay unto you, then you will become as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, as one, that is out of the favour of the gods, can be. As for me, who am the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of their will, by thus telling you, I do deprive you of all excuſes, which can be drawn from ignorance. You know, that heaven requires obedience and ſubmiſſion above all other ſacrifices, therefore be ſure you remember what I ſay. Upon the Bacchanalian feaſt day, when men are ſwell'd with the enthuſiaſms of their god, you ſhall be in the great Town of <hi>Marcelles,</hi> where many Gallants will ſee you; but, take good heed of him who ſhall wear a ſuit made of green cloth of gold: If you do love him, I ſhall lament your ſad fate, for you ſhall be the Butt of all diſaſters and misfortunes. Father, ſaid ſhe unto me, I do know a good remedie againſt all theſe, and that is, to love none at all My Child (ſaid I unto her) there is danger alſo in this remedie; for, you may as well offend the gods, in not doing that which they would have you do, as in doing that which they would not have you do; therefore take heed of that. How then muſt I behave my ſelfe (ſaid ſhe)? I have already told you what you muſt not do, (anſwered I); And now I will
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53526:36"/>
tell you what you muſt do: In the firſt place you muſt know, that all corporeall or ſphitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bodies, have their ſympathies and antipathies from the leſſer we may come to the proof of the greater. My aim is, to make you underſtand, that you have both a good and a bad Genius waiting upon you, one contrary to the other; and to avoid the bad, you muſt court the good, who will make you infinitely happy, did you but know to hit your houre Oh Father! (ſaid ſhe) I do conjure you by the divinity whom you adore to tell me what I ſhould do. There is another perſon, (anſwered I) whom if you do marry, you will enjoy more felicitie, then ever any mortall did. I beſeech you, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> who is it? That, fair Nymph (ſaid I) muſt not come from me, but only from <hi>Hecathe</hi> whom I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, ſo as if I do not ſatisfie you in that, do not think it is for want of any good will, but becauſe ſhe hath not yet revealed it unto me; may be, becauſe I had not ſo much curioſity as to enquire it. But if you would know, then obſerve what I ſhall ſay unto you, and then you ſhall know as much as is neceſſary: for, as the Gods do liberally diſpence their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits unto men when they pleaſe, ſo they would be acknowledged Gods: The ſacrifices of mortalls are pleaſing unto them, as teſtimonies, that they are not ungratefull for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which they receive. The Nymph much raviſhed then, anſwered, That ſhe deſired no more, and that ſhe would punctually obſerve whatſoever I ſhould ordain. Now then is the time, ſaid I unto her, for the Moon is now at the full, or very neer it; and if you ſhould let her decreaſe, it would for ever after be too late. Then I did command her to do the ſame things I did <hi>Silvia</hi> and <hi>Leonida,</hi> to waſh her ſelfe before day in this little River, both thighes and armes, and to come thus, with a Chaplet of Vervine, and a Girdle of Moſſe or Fem, before my Cell, and that I would prepare all things neceſſary for the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Well, ſaid ſhe, I will come, and bring two of my Nymphs with me, and ſo privatly, that none ſhall ever know of my coming but they: but, be ſure you be well adviſed what you ſpeak before them of this buſineſſe, for they wil endeavour all they can to divert me. I was very glad of this caution, having my ſelfe the ſame fears; and becauſe I perceived, that ſhe reſolved to follow my counſell, otherwiſe ſhe would not have cared who had known it. Thus ſhe went away, with a full reſolution to return the third day after. The reaſon why I ſaid, that it muſt be before the Moones decreaſe, was, to the end, that if any came to me in the mean time, I might put them off with an excuſe, that the Mocil was not yet at the full. Alſo I ſaid, that it muſt be before day, to the end I might have fewer people come to trouble me And as for the Bacchanalian Feaſt, I had computed it to fall upon the ſame day, on which <hi>Lindamor</hi> was to take his leave of <hi>Amaſis</hi> at <hi>Marcelles,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of <hi>Galathea;</hi> and alſo, that he ſhould wear this day a green ſuit. All things then being thus reſolved upon, and prepared, I took order for the ſacrifice: and though I was not well verſed in that myſtery, yet, I ſhewed all the skill I had, leſt they ſhould finde me ignorant in any thing.</p>
               <p>The morning being come, and day within little of dawning, I found her in the ſame poſture I appointed, with <hi>Silvia</hi> and <hi>Leonida.</hi> I wiſhed with all my ſoul, <hi>Polemas,</hi> that you had been there, that you might have enjoyed the happineſſe to have ſeen this fair one, in ſuch a lovely mode; you had ſeen how the wanton winde did play with her lovely locks, which hung looſe in curious curles upon her alabaſter ſhoulders, and had no other cover, but the Chaplet of Vervine. There you might have bleſſed your eyes with a ſight of her naked armes and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ighes, no ſhow ſo white; and her pretty little feet might have ſhamed <hi>Thetis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt ingenuouſly confeſſe, that I wiſhed the wings of time had been clipped, that I might have looked longer upon theſe beauties, who, as I told them, muſt needs be well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed with the fineſt Aromatique ſmells, leſt the viſions of the deity of <hi>Styx</hi> ſhould offend them, and to that end ſhewed them a place more private, where they could not eaſily be ſeen.</p>
               <p>Upon the ſide of a hill from whence this little River runs, there was a very cloſe and thick thicket of wood, whoſe branches were ſo enterwoven with leaves, they did make moſt cloſe and delightfull umbrage; ſo as the penetrating Sun-beams could not reach into the hollow vault under it: This gloomy ſhade did encourage them unto much boldneſſe, but yet their curioſity to be informed of what they defired, much more: There then it was where theſe three Nymphs began to undreſſe themſelves, and uſe all ſuch neceſſary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes as I preſcribed; and I knowing the place very well, did ſteal my ſelfe ſo neer, as I could eaſily ſee them naked. I muſt confeſſe, I never ſaw ſo lovely a ſight in all my life; but above all, I found <hi>Leonida</hi> moſt admirable, both in the ſtraight proportion of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53526:37"/>
in the purely whiteneſſe of her skin, in the ſmoothneſſe and plumpneſſe of every part ſhe excelled them all by much; ſo as I began to diſcommend your judgment, and think you a man unexpert in hidden beauties, ſince you quitted <hi>Leonida</hi> for <hi>Galathea:</hi> who, it is true, has ſomthing that is fair in her face; but, her other parts are ſo fat ſhort, of what by her face might be expected, as ſhe may be truly called a deceiver. Oh heavens! <hi>Climan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes</hi> (ſaid <hi>Polemas,</hi> who could not endure to hear her whom he ſo loved thus ſpoken of) leave off this diſcourſe, for <hi>Leonida's</hi> face is not worthy to come in compariſon with <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathea's.</hi> Well ſir, (anſwered <hi>Climanthes)</hi> think what you pleaſe, but I am ſure <hi>Leonida's</hi> face is the leaſt fair part about all her body. Then I would adviſe her (ſaid <hi>Polemas)</hi> to hide her face, and ſhew us what is more fair: But I believe, <hi>Climanthes,</hi> your eyes were not competent judges; for the obſcurity of the place, perhaps, would not ſuffer you to ſee them perfectly. But i beſeech you let this diſcourſe alone, and go on with your ſtory. <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onida,</hi> who heard all this, and ſeeing with what ſcorn <hi>Polemas</hi> did ſpeak of her, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be ſo much offended with him, as ſhe reſolved never to pardon him. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, though ſhe hated theſe impoſtures of <hi>Climanthes,</hi> yet ſhe could not chuſe but love to hear her ſelfe ſo much commended: for nothing does more tickle a young Lady, than ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding her beauty, eſpecially, when there is no ſuſpition of flattery. Whilſt ſhe was in theſe thoughts, ſhe heard <hi>Climanthes</hi> continue his ſtory, on thus, Then theſe three Nymphs came unto me, where they found me before my Cell, and preparing all things for the ſacrifice I lighted up three candles, and I burned incenſe three times round the room then I took off their Chaplets of Vervine, and crowned them with Poppy, and put ſome falt into their mouths, and bad them chew it: Then I took three black Heifers, the beſt I could chuſe, and nine Ewes which had never taken the Ramm, whoſe black and long wool reſembled ſilk, ſo ſoft and ſmooth it was I cut off the hair which grew between their hornes, and coſt it into the fire, ſprinkling upon it milk, wine, flower, and honey; and after I had called upon <hi>Hecathe</hi> three times, I thruſt my knife into the hearts of theſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, one after another, and took their blood in a great baſon: Then falling upon my knees, I called again upon <hi>Hecathe;</hi> afterwards I roſe up, and ſeemed as if I were tranſported, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the Nymphs, See, ſee, the deitie! it is time, it is time, it is time! then taking <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoa</hi> by the hand, I ſtared with my eyes, ſhook my head, gaped with my mouth, made my breaſt to pant, and all my body trembled, as if I were in a holy rapture: Then being neer the altar, I ſaid, Oh holy deitie, who reſides in this place, give unto me power to ſatisfie this Nymph in her demands with all truth. The room was dark, and had no light, but ſuch a hollow gloomineſſe as the candles gave; but the day being now light, and the Sun up, it ſhined upon the painted paper, and made it repreſent it ſelfe much better in the Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king glaſſe; afterwards I addreſſed my ſelfe unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> ſaying, Oh fair Nymph! thou art the favourit of heaven, thy prayers are heard, and thy ſacrifice is received<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is the pleaſure of the deitie, that not only by the ear, but alſo by the eye, thou maiſt know the place where thou ſhalt finde thy happineſſe. Come neer this altar, and ſay after me, Oh, moſt mighty <hi>Hecathe,</hi> whoſe habitation is in the <hi>Stygian</hi> Lake, at whom the churliſh Dog with three heads never barks; may thy altars ever ſmoak with acceptable ſacrifices, which I do vow annually to pay, ſo as, great goddeſſe, thou wilt let me ſee what I deſire. At this word I let down the plank which had the ſteel in it, which being fallen upon the flint, the fire did flaſh preſently, ſo as <hi>Galathea</hi> was ſurpriſed with fear: But I did ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, Fear not fair Nymph, it is <hi>Hecathe</hi> who ſhewes you what you deſire. Then the ſmoak by degrees vaniſhing, the Looking glaſſe was to be ſeen; and, as good luck was, the Sun ſhined ſo clearly and directly upon it, as made the painted paper moſt plainly appear in it: After they had a while beheld it, I ſaid unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> Know Nymph, that <hi>Hecathe</hi> by me does let thee know, It is in this place which you ſee in the Glaſſe, where you ſhall finde a jewell, halfe loſt and deſpiſed, out of a thought that it is falſe; and yet it is of an ineſtimable value, take it and keep it carefully. This River which you ſee in it, is <hi>Lignon:</hi> that Grove of Willowes beyond it is towards Mount <hi>Verdan.</hi> Obſerve well the place and remember it. Then taking <hi>Galathea</hi> aſide, I ſaid unto her, You have, as I told you before, a Genius, that ſwells with abundance of malevolent influence; and another, the moſt benign and ſweet, as poſſibly can be deſired From the evill influence guard your ſelfe, if you do love your own contentment: the good influence is that which you do ſee in the mirrour. Obſerve well the place which I have let you ſee, and to the end you may the better remember it, I bid you go and ſee it, and obſerve it well; for, when the Moon ſhall be juſt of the ſame age, that this day ſhe is, a little ſooner, or a little later, you ſhall
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53526:37"/>
finde him whom you moſt love: If he ſee you before you ſee him, he ſhall love you, and you with much a do will love him: On the contrary, if you ſee him firſt, he ſhall be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought to love you, but you will love him immediately: But however, you muſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come your ſelfe and love him, yea, and overcome him alſo, if need be; for doubtleſſe you will at laſt bring it to paſſe: If you do not meet him the firſt time, then go again the next Moon, upon the ſame day, and ſame houre, and ſo to the third; for come he will, though <hi>Hecathe</hi> will not aſſure me of the day. Then taking a little branch of Hollin in my hand, I went unto the Looking-glaſſe, and with the end of it, ſhewed her all theſe places: Look, (ſaid I) ſee where the Mountain of <hi>I ſoures</hi> is; ſee where Mount <hi>Verdun</hi> is, ſee where the River <hi>Lignon</hi> is, ſee, a little beyond it, where the Meadow is, through which you have oft gone to hunt: All theſe places you may perhaps know, but I do not know them. Now Nymph, the ſacred deitie of this place commands me to tell you, that if you do not pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually obſerve what I ſay, and what you have promiſed, ſhe will augment all the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which your deſtiny does threaten you with all: For my part, I do think my ſelfe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, that before my departure I have given you this advice: for, though I am not of this Country; yet, your vertue and piety does oblige me to love you, and to pray unto <hi>Heca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the</hi> to make you fully happy: And with this prayer I will take my leave of you; for the goddeſſe whom I adore hath commanded me to depart before the day, to morrow. An this word I did put them all out of my Cabin, after I had taken from them their Vervine, Ferne, and Hollin Chaplets, which I did burn in the fire.</p>
               <p>I did prefix her three Moones, to the end, that if you failed one day, you might be there another. I told her that if ſhe ſaw you firſt, then ſhe ſhould eaſily love you; and if you ſaw her firſt, the contrary; only becauſe I knew very well you would be firſt there ſo as ſhe would finde in her ſelfe the truth of my prediction, for you know, ſhe loves <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor.</hi> I told her that I was to depart before to morrow, to the end ſhe ſhould not think ſtrange at my departure, if out of ſome freſh curioſity ſhe ſhould come again: For having now done as much as my aimes did drive at, my beſt way was to haſte away, leſt ſome Druide ſhould hear of me, and puniſh me, which, you know, was alwaies my fear. Do you think, <hi>Polemas,</hi> I have omitted any materiall circumſtance? No certainly ſaid <hi>Polemas,</hi> only me thinks you gave her too large a time; I would you had confined her to one day, and then I ſhould have been ſure to have met with her. For my part, ſaid <hi>Climanthes,</hi> I know not what to think, but that ſhe hath counted the age of the Moon wrong; and I do verily believe, that but for this Shepheard who was drowned, and who cauſed many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſeek about for him, you had met with him that day: But let us have a little pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for I am confident, that the ſame reaſon which made you retreat, did alſo make her do the like. But, me thinks it is time to riſe, to the end we may depart. Then opening the window, he perceived it to be bright day. Away, away, make haſte (ſaid <hi>Climanthes</hi> to <hi>Polemas)</hi> the houre will be paſt elſe; you had better be many houres too ſoon, then a minute too late. Would you have me go thither now (ſaid <hi>Polemas)?</hi> do you think ſhe will come, ſince it is fifteen daies paſt the prefixed time? No matter (anſwered he) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſhe has miſcounted the dayes, who can tell? and therefore let us go.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonida</hi> was afraid leaſt <hi>Polemas</hi> and <hi>Climanthes</hi> ſhould ſee her, and therefore durſt not riſe till they were gone: but when they were out of the houſe ſhe dreſſed herſelf. And after ſhe had taken leave of her hoſt, ſhe continued on her Journey ſo confuſed at the cunning ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice of theſe two perſons, as ſhe almoſt never minded her way and ſhe was touched ſo to the quick, that <hi>Polemas</hi> ſhould ſo deſpiſe her beauty, that to be revenged of him, ſhe would make <hi>Lindamor</hi> acquainted with his treachery, which ſhe thought ſhe could not better do then by the meanes of her Uncle <hi>Adamas</hi> unto whom ſhe intended to communicate the, matter. And in this reſolution, ſhe made all the haſte ſhe could unto <hi>Feurs,</hi> where ſhe thought to find him; but ſhe came too late, for he went homwards betimes in the morning, having the day before, finiſhed all ceremonies belonging to the ſacrifice: as he went the day was very hot, therefore when he was in the plain of Mount <hi>Verdun,</hi> he turned out of the way where he ſaw a handſom ſhade of trees, to reſt himſelf a while. And he was no ſooner come at it, but he eſpied a ſhepheard comming and ſeeming as if he intended to take the ſame conveniency of ſhade. And becauſe when he came neere, he ſeemed to be exceeding penſive, he would not take any notice of him, leſt he ſhould diſturbe his thoughts, but ſhaded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe purpoſely to heare what he would ſay: at laſt, he heard him break out thus: Why ſhould I be ſo ſimple as to love this wethercock? in the firſt place her beauty cannot much move, for ſhe has ſo little as all ſhe has cannot merit the name of Fair: moreover, there are
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53526:38"/>
no other conſiderations that can help out her merits, or retaine any man of parts in her ſervice: Again, her affection is all that can poſſibly oblige me, and that is of ſuch a mutable temper, as if ſhe have any impreſſion of Love in heart, I beleeve it is but like unto wax and wax ſo ſoft as will eaſily take any new impreſſion and deface the old: at the moſt, if I do love her, I muſt confeſſe it is meerly becauſe I think ſhe loves me. This ſhepheard had gone on his diſcourſe, had not a ſhepheardeſſe overtaken him, who it ſeemes followed after him: and ſitting down by him thus began to ſay: Come, <hi>Corilas,</hi> come, what new diſguſt is it, that makes you thus penſive' The ſhepheard returned as diſdaining an anſwer as he could, and never ſo much as turning his head towards her, anſwered thus; I am thinking what a trick of Legerdemaine you have uſed, to get away from them whom even now you loved; why <hi>Corilas</hi> (ſaid ſhe) can you think I Love any but your ſelf? Than you? Said the ſhepheard, can you think I beleeve you Love me? What then do you beleeve of me (ſaid ſhe) I beleeve you are a foole, (ſaid he) to love one that hates you. You have a very ſtrange opinion of me (ſaid ſhe): And you (ſaid <hi>Corilas)</hi> have ſtrange effects in yourſelf Oh heavens (ſaid the ſhepheardeſſe) what kind of a man have I met withall? I have more reaſon to ſay in ſo meeting with <hi>Stella,</hi> anſwered he, what kind of a woman have I met withall? For never was any more incapable of amity then you; you I ſay, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in nothing more then deceiving thoſe who truſt you; who imitates Hunters, that with abundance of toyle does hunt the game, and then gives it, as a reward, to the dogges. There is ſo litele reaſon in all you ſay (ſaid ſhe) as thoſe have leſſe that wil ſtay to anſwer you. I wiſh (ſaid the ſhepheard) that I had alwaies as much reaſon in my ſoul, as there is at this time in my words, then ſhould I not grieve ſo much as I do. Afterwards both of them being ſilent a long while, at laſt ſhe began to ſing and thus in ſinging to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe her ſelf unto him. Alſo he, becauſe he would not ſit mute without returning anſwer, thus replyed unto her.</p>

               <p>The ſhepheardeſſe ſeeing he had all his replyes ſo ready, ſhe left off her ſinging, and ſaid thus unto him, why <hi>Corilas</hi> is there no manner of hope in you? No, ſaid he, no more then there is in your fidelity. Never think that all your flattery and fair language can make me change my reſolution; for, beleeve it, I am moſt firmly fixed. It is meer vanitie to make uſe of any armes or charmes againſt me, they are all too weak. I would adviſe you <hi>Stella</hi> to imploy them and your time upon ſome other, who not knowing you, will not perhaps ſleight you as I do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Noveltie is pleaſing you know: and perhaps you may meet with ſome, whom heaven having a deſigne to puniſh, may Love you: The ſhepheardeſſe was in good earneſt nettled at this yet turning it into a ſeeming Jeaſt, ſhe ſmiled and ſaid: Oh <hi>Corilas</hi> I cannot chuſe but laugh at your cholerique humor, but ere long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhall ſee you in a better mood: Nay I know, replyed the ſhepheard, that it is your humour to laugh at thoſe who love you, but I aſſure you, that you may laugh long enough at me before I do Love you; Thus theſe two enemies parted: and <hi>Adamas</hi> knowing by their names of what families they were he had a deſire to know more of their buſineſſe: and calling <hi>Corilas</hi> by his name, he came unto him; and cauſing him to ſit down by him, he thus ſaid, my Son (for ſo I may call you out of the affection I ever had unto your familie) you need not be ſorry that you have ſpoken ſo freely unto <hi>Stella</hi> before me: I am very glad to ſee you ſo diſcreet: but I do deſire to know further of your buſineſſe, to the end I may give you my faithfull advice. As ſoon as <hi>Corilas</hi> ſaw the <hi>Druide,</hi> he remembred that he had often ſeen him officia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in ſeverall Sacrifices: but ſince he had never ſpoke to him before, he had not the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to relate the paſſages twixt <hi>Stella</hi> and him; that he was ever willing that all the world did know the Juſtice of his cauſe, and the perfidy of <hi>Stella:</hi> which <hi>Adamas</hi> perceiving, by way of encouragement told him that he was partly acquainted with the buſineſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and that to his comfort many did ſpeak in his behalfe. I am afraid, Father (ſaid <hi>Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las)</hi> that the trifles of our villages will be very tedious unto you. No No: replyed <hi>Adamas,</hi> a relation of this buſineſſe will much pleaſe me, and time alſo will be well imployed by ſo ſpending away the heat of the day.</p>

                  <hi>The Hiſtory of</hi> Stella <hi>and</hi> Corilas.</head>
               <p>SInce, Father, you command it ſo (ſaid the Shepheard) I will relate the whole matter unto you. <hi>Stella</hi> is the Widow of a Husband which Heaven gave her, rather for a name then ought elſe: for, beſides his ſickneſſe: his age, which was above ſixtie ſix, had ſo impaired his ſtrength, that he left her a luſty young Widow, before ſhe was almoſt married: And the affection ſhe had unto him was not ſo much, as to make her grieve too much for her loſſe; nor indeed was her humour ſuch, as to take any thing too much to heart. When ſhe ſaw her ſelfe ridd of two heavy yokes, both almoſt at once to wit, a rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance from an old, craſy, and peeviſh Husband, and from that ſtricteſt obſervance which is expected from Ghildren to Parents, ſhe then began to ſhew her ſelfe, and ruffle in the world with a great noiſe: And as ſhe was none of thoſe killing beauties, that make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves loved by force, ſo her affectedneſſe did not at all pleaſe any that looked upon her. Her age was ſome ſeventeen or eighteen, an age that is apt to commit much folly, when liberty is given unto it. This was the reaſon that <hi>Saliam</hi> her Brother, a very honeſt and diſcreet Shepheard, not being able to endure the expenſive courſes which ſhe drew upon him, and in ſome ſort to reſtrain her, did get her out of his village, into ſuch a place, where ſhe might live in leſſe danger of ſcandall: in order to which, he intreated <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> that he would be pleaſed to let her accompany his Daughter <hi>Amintha,</hi> becauſe they ſuited ſo well in age, though <hi>Stella</hi> had a little the ſtart of her: And <hi>Cleanthes</hi> being content, there grew ſuch a familiarity betwixt theſe two Shepheardeſſes, and they lived ſuch pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate lives and contented, as they were never out of ſight of one another. Many did wonder, that theſe two being of ſuch different tempers, yet they did ſo well comply; but the ſweet and loving diſpoſition of <hi>Amintha,</hi> and the ſupple and eaſie nature of <hi>Stella,</hi> were the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; ſo <hi>Amintha</hi> never croſſed the deſignes of her Companion, and <hi>Stella</hi> never thwarted whatſoever <hi>Amintha</hi> deſired; ſo as they kept ſuch a correſpondency together, as nothing was hid from each other. But at laſt, <hi>Lyſis,</hi> the Son of the Shepheard <hi>Genetian,</hi> leaving the frozen valleyes of Mount <hi>Luna,</hi> and coming into our more pleaſant plaines, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Stella</hi> at an aſſembly in the Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> when <hi>Aſtrea</hi> did carry away the priſe of beauty, he fell ſo in love with <hi>Stella,</hi> as I do not well know whether or no, it hath not ſent him to his Grave: And ſhe was ſo compliant to him, as after ſeverall journeyes and meſſages, things were come to that paſſe, as <hi>Lyſis</hi> moved her to marriage, unto which ſhe gave as favourable an anſwer as he could deſire. At this time, <hi>Saliant</hi> was conſtrained unto ſuch a far off journey, as he knew nothing of this treaty: beſides, ſhe did now take upon her ſelfe ſuch abſolute authority, as ſhe did not communicate her matters unto him. On the other ſide, <hi>Amintha</hi> ſeeing her ſo ſoon reſolved upon marriage, did often ask her, whether or no ſhe was in good earneſt; and told her, that it was a matter of ſo great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as required very great and ſerious conſideration. <hi>Amintha,</hi> anſwered ſhe, never trouble your ſelfe, for I am not gon ſo far, but I can eaſily make a retreat. Mean time, <hi>Lyſis</hi> did make himſelfe ſo ſure of marriage, as that he ſet down the day, invited many of his friends, and was at ſuch charges, as are uſuall upon ſuch occaſions. But <hi>Stella,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtome of many women, who are proud of their own libertie, ſtarted from her firſt intentions, and broke all off by ſuch unreaſonable demands, as ſhe knew the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of <hi>Lyſis</hi> would never conſent unto: But, his love being above all difficulties and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying all her unreaſonable demands, ſhe was at laſt forced to break off with him upon no other pretence, but the ſlenderneſſe of his affection to her. You may eaſily imagine how <hi>Lyſis</hi> reſented this affront; but however, he could not yet maſter his love: And I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber upon this ſubject, he compoſed theſe Verſes, which afterwards he gave unto me.</p>

               <p>The cauſe of <hi>Stella's</hi> change in her affection, was the courtſhip of another Shepheard called <hi>Semires,</hi> which did imprint it ſelfe very deep in her ſoul, and which <hi>Lyſis</hi> did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the laſt of all men, for ſhe did conceal it more from him than any other. This Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard <hi>Semires</hi> was of all men that my converſation ever met with, the moſt diſſembling and crafty; that he was otherwiſe a man of very excellent parts, which cauſed this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe to go againſt her own promiſe, and reject the match with <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and to confer all her favours upon her new Lover, who yet did not long triumph in this victory. For ſo it happened, that <hi>Lupeander</hi> making a great Feaſt at the marriage of his Daughter <hi>Olympia, Lyſis</hi> and <hi>Stella</hi> were invited thither; and I being a kinſman unto the Bride, I would not ſail to be there alſo. I know not whether Love did it cut of revenge, or whether it was the naturall giddineſſe of <hi>Stella's</hi> wavering temper; but ſo it was, that ſhe no ſooner ſaw <hi>Lyſis,</hi> then ſhe had a minde to recall him into her favour; and in order to that, ſpruced up her ſelfe in all her affectedneſſe which nature had very imprudently been prodigall of unto her: But, the offended ſpirit of this Shepheard had armed him with ſo much courage, as to hide all his affection to her, though he could not extinguiſh the flames of love. Towards night, when every one prepared for dancing, and to apply themſelves unto thoſe perſons moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their liking; <hi>Stella</hi> did ſo purſue <hi>Lyſis;</hi> that he being in a corner of a window, he could not handſomely avoid her, but was forced to receive the aſſaults of his loving ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. <hi>Semires</hi> all this while obſerving how ſhe purſued <hi>Lyſis;</hi> all the evening, according to the naturall temper of all Lovers, he began to be ſprinkled with jealouſie, knowing well, that a candle newly extinguiſhed, will ſoon light again: And ſeeing her ſo cloſe to <hi>Lyſis,</hi> he got ſo neer, as ſeeming to talk unto another, he heard her ask <hi>Lyſis,</hi> why he ſhunned her ſo much? To which <hi>Lyſis</hi> replied, The reaſon is, becauſe you do ſo impudently purſue me. But Shepheard, replyed <hi>Stella,</hi> I know from whence your diſcontents proceed, and I believe, not from him whom you imagine. For gods-ſake (anſwered <hi>Lyſis)</hi> let me alone in quietneſſe; it is enough that thy offence proceeds from your hating me, and your hatred from your own levity: But 'tis no matter, all's forgotten, and now I have no minde to love. Well, well, (anſwered ſhe) I know from whence all your anger proceeds, and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you have ſome ſeeming reaſon for it; but, I beſeech you conſider it a little better. Is it ſuch an impardonable injury, not to take a man to a husband, as ſoon as ever he hath asked the queſtion? Is it not the cuſtome of our Country, that he ſhould ask that queſtion twice? The truth is, if I had marryed another, I had done you an injury: But, what likelyhood is there, that I ſhould ever refuſe a man ſo conſtant, that hath loved me almoſt theſe three months? The offended ſpirit of <hi>Lyſis</hi> not ſuffering him to love her, and his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not ſuffering him to hate her, he did not know in what termes to anſwer her; and yet, to ſtop the torrent of words, he thus ſaid unto her: I have had ſufficient experience, <hi>Stella,</hi> that you know better how to ſay then do, and that you abound much more in words than reaſon: but, take this for an unalterable certainty, that look how much I loved you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, ſo much, or more, do I hate you now, and ſhall do as long as I live; ſo as there ſhall not be a day, in which I will nor divulge you unto all the world, for the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull and conſening woman under heaven. Upon this, forcing his affection and the arme of <hi>Stella</hi> away, he broke from her, and left her alone in the window, whilſt he went amongſt the reſt of the Shepheards. <hi>Semires,</hi> who, as I told you, heard all this diſcourſe, was both ſo amazed and ill ſatisfied with her, as he reſolved ever ſince to make no more addreſſes unto ſuch a wavering weathercock; which reſolution was much more confirmed by me; for, I having long looked for an opportunity of ſpeaking to her, and ſeeing <hi>Lyſis</hi> had
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53526:40"/>
left her alone, I accoſted her; for I muſt confeſſe that her allurements had ſome power upon my ſoul, and ſo much as the affronts which ſhe had put upon <hi>Lyſis</hi> would not let me ſee her imperfections, and fleeting diſpoſition. And as every one is apt to flatter himſelfe in his own deſires; ſo I ſuppoſed that what the merits of <hi>Lyſis</hi> could not obtaine from her, my good fortune might. As long as <hi>Lyſis</hi> courted her, I would not let my affection appeare, for beſides conſangunity, there was a great league of amitie betwixt us: but when I ſaw he was off, and thinking the place vacant (for I never took notice of <hi>Semires)</hi> I thought it a fit time to open my ſelf, before ſhe entertained any other ſo addreſſing my ſelfe unto her, and finding her all penſiveneſſe, I ſaid unto her, that certainly it was ſome great occaſion which thus had altered her; for ſadneſſe was ſeldom ſeen in her pleaſant humour. It is that troubleſome <hi>Lyſis</hi> (anſwered ſhe) who has put me in mind of old ſtories, and ſtill upbraids me with the refuſing of him: Does that trouble you, (ſaid I unto her?) can it chuſe (anſwered)? how ſhe for affection is not ſo ſoon put off as ones cloaths are but becauſe I did a little delay his deſires, he took it for an abſolute diſcharge: Truly (ſaid I) <hi>Lyſis</hi> did not deſerve the honour of your favour: for what he could not compaſſe by his merits, he ought to have tryed what all his ſervices accompanied with a long patience would do, but his boyling temper, together with perhaps his too little love would not permit him. Had the ſame happineſſe hapned unto me as unto him, with what affection ſhould I have entertained it? And with what patience ſhould I have waited for it? You would think it ſtrange (reverend Father) to heare me tell you, how ſuddenly this ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe changed: yet I proteſt ſhe entertained the overture of my Love, as ſoon as ever I made it: and in ſuch a manner, as, before we parted, ſhe permitted me to call my ſelf her ſervant. You may eaſily conceive that <hi>Semires,</hi> who heard all this, was no better ſatisfied with me then he was with <hi>Lyſis:</hi> but ever ſince he hath diſcontinued his addreſſes, yet ſo diſcreetly as many think <hi>Stella</hi> to be the cauſe, for ſhe ſeemed not to care for it, becauſe the place of her affection was poſſeſſed with the new hopes ſhe had of me, which was the cauſe that I received many favours from her and which <hi>Lyſis</hi> quickly perceived. But Love which alwaies will tryumph over freindſhip, did keep me from ſpeaking unto him, leſt I ſhould offend the ſhepheardeſſe: and though he was much offended that I ſhould thus conceale my my ſelfe from him, yet I never did ſpeak unto him without <hi>Stella's</hi> leave, who alſo ſeemed deſirous it ſhould be ſo. But I who then was ignorant of her tricks, and ſtrived at nothing but how to content her, one night when <hi>Lyſis</hi> and I were together, I had this diſcourſe with him: I muſt confeſſe <hi>Lyſis</hi> (ſaid I unto him) that I have not ſo clearly opened my ſelf unto you, as our freindſhip required; but now you muſt help me out, or elſe I am undon: I (anſwered <hi>Lyſis)</hi> why you may be aſſured that I will never faile the part of a friend, though your miſtruſt of me might alter the caſe: and yet do not think but I do know of your Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but your ſilence ſo offended me, that I ſaid nothing of it: Since you did know it, replied I, and never ſpoke to me of it, I have the greater cauſe to be offended: for I do confeſſe, that I have ſomthing failed in point of freindſhip by my ſilence: but you muſt conſider that a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is not himſelfe, and his diſeaſe is an excuſe for all his errours: but you who are not troubled with the ſame paſſionate diſeaſe, you have no excuſe for your failings in point of freindſhip. <hi>Lyſis</hi> hearing my reaſons, began to ſmile and ſaid. You are very pleaſant <hi>Corilas,</hi> and I will not contradict you, but I pray you tell me, how I may make amends for my fault: In doing that for me, ſaid I, which you could not: for your ſelf, which is that I may obtain the affection of <hi>Stella:</hi>
Oh heavens (cryed out <hi>Lyſis</hi> then) unto what a dangerous preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice have you brought your ſelf: Shun it, <hi>Corilas,</hi> ſhun it, for it is a moſt dangerous paſſage, which ruines all thoſe which ever took it: I ſpeak unto you by experience; you know it, I know, that from any other, your merits can obtaine more then mine; but it is groſſe folly to hope for any thing from this perfidious woman, whom neither vertue nor reaſon will move; to which I anſwered that to hear him ſay ſo, was no ſmal contentment: for, ſaid I, until now I was afraid you had retained ſome thoughts for your ſelf, &amp; therefore I was ſo reſerved but ſince, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks be to the fates, it is not ſo, I wil in this buſineſs put you to the tryal of friendſhip: I know that the hatred which ſucceeds Love is alwaies meaſured according to the grandure of its predeceſſor: and that you once loving this ſhepheardeſſe: and now comming to hate her your hatred will be far greater then if you had never loved her: Yet underſtanding from <hi>Stella</hi> her ſelf, that I can never arrive at my deſires but by your meanes, I do conjure you <hi>Lyſis</hi> by our friendſhip to aide me, either by adviſing or ſpeaking for me or any other way. I will take it as a moſt extream proof of your fidelity. <hi>Lyſis</hi> was extreamly ſurpriſed at this deſire, expecting any other prayer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me then this; by which, beſides his diſlike from this of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53526:40"/>
ſpeaking unto <hi>Stella,</hi> he had loſt a freind whom he loved moſt. Yet he anſwered thus unto me; <hi>Corilas,</hi> I will do as you deſire, you can expect no more from me: but ſtill remember that in meſſages of Love ſuch perſons ſhould be imployed as are not hated. Thus poor <hi>Liſis</hi> in lieu of a lover became a meſſenger of Love: a difficultie which his affection to me made him undertake, and he had full intentions to ſerve me, though afterwards he changed his mind; but the violence of his Love muſt plead his excuſe, for Love hath a moſt predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate power over men: and truly his affection to me is to be both commended and admired, ſince he was once willing to part from her he loved to let me enjoy her. One day watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an opportunitie of ſpeaking unto her, he found her at home by herſelf, none being by to interrupt their diſcourſe: then calling to memorie the affronts he formerly had received he ſo armed himſelf againſt her charmes, as Love at this time could have no hope of overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. And though the ſhepheardeſſe ſtudied alwaies to tryumph over him, yet he did ſo oppoſe his ſpleen againſt her and his freindſhip to me, that at this combate he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querer Before he began to ſpeak ſhe went to meet him, and pumped for ſome of her affected language; What new happyneſſe is this, ſaid ſhe, that hath brought back my long'd for <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> to me? What an unexpected favour is this? Come come, ſince you are returned I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to hope againe for I dare ſwear that never ſince you left me, have I enjoyed a minute of content; to which the ſhepheard anſwered: More eloquent then faithfull ſhepheardeſſe, I am better ſatisfied with this your ingenuous confeſſion, then if I had not been offended at your in fidelity; but let us leave off this kind of diſcourſe, and forget it for ever: anſwer me only to ſuch demands as I ſhall make unto you. Are you ſtill reſolved to deceive all thoſe who ſhall ever Love you? For my part, I muſt beleeve you are; for none of your humours are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne unto me: but I came to ſee and ask how many adorers: you have, and whether you did not ſay and proteſt and ſwear unto them, that none ſhould ever be deceived by you; for if you did, certainly they are in my predicament and rank. The ſhepheardeſſe did not expect theſe reproaches yet ſhe anſwered him, and thus. Shepheard, though you came only with deſignes to wrong me, yet I give you thanks for the viſit, and confeſſe that you have reaſon to complaine againſt me. I complaine (anſwered he)? no I pray you let that alone; I will neither wrong you nor complain againſt you: but am ſo farre from it, that I will rather commend your humour: for had you ſeemed to love me any longer, I had been longer delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: And I pray God, the loſſe of your Love bring me no more hurt then it doth ſorrow, you ſhall never heare that I complain of you: for injurie and truth cannot ſubſiſt together, no more then you &amp; fidelity: can but take this for a moſt certain truth, that you are the moſt deluding and ungrateful ſhepheardeſſe in all <hi>Forreſts.</hi> Me thinks, diſcourteous ſhepheard, (anſwered <hi>Stella)</hi> that this language would become any other mouth better then yours. Then <hi>Lyſis</hi> began to addreſſe himſelf in another dialect: Hitherto (ſaid he) I have borrowed my language from the juſt anger of <hi>Lyſis;</hi> but now I will borrow it of one that hath more to do with you then <hi>Lyſis</hi> hath; &amp; that is from a diſcreet ſhepheard who loves you, and who values nothing upon earth comparable to your favorable acceptance of him &amp; his ſervices. She thinking that <hi>Liſis</hi> mocked her, anſwered him thus; Leave off this diſcourſe, <hi>Lyſis:</hi> it is enough that you once did Love me without any reviving of the memorie of your errors; 'Tis very true, ſaid the Shepheard, they were errors indeed that moved me to love you; out you erre as much as I did, if you think that I do love you now, or that I ſpeak for my ſelfe: No, no I ſpeak in behalfe of poor <hi>Corilas,</hi> who is ſo wholly your devoted, as nothing can draw him off: I told him how I had tried you, and what little aſſurance there was to be found in your ſoul and words: I ſwore unto him, that you would certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, and that I was ſure you would keep me from being forſworn: But, the poor, miſerable, loving thing, is ſo blinded, as he thinks, what I cannot obtain, his merits can; and yet to undeceive him, I told him, that merit was the greateſt impediment to obtain any thing from you. And to the end you may believe what I ſay, I pray read this Letter which he hath ſent you. But becauſe <hi>Stella</hi> would not read my Letter, <hi>Lyſis</hi> did open it, and read it aloud unto her.</p>

               <p>Aſſoon as <hi>Lyſis</hi> had read this Letter, he went on with his diſcourſe: Come <hi>Stella,</hi> (ſaid he) what death muſt he die, or how muſt he live? For my part, I pitty him with all my heart, and wiſh you could do the like. I pray conſider how bitter your deniall will be to him. This diſcourſe did touch this Shepheardeſſe to the quick, and ſeeing how far <hi>Lyſis</hi> was from loving her, ſhe interrupted him in this manner, Me thinks <hi>Lyſis</hi> (ſaid ſhe) if <hi>Corilas</hi> were in ſuch a minde as this paper ſpeaks him, he was very ill adviſed to employ you, ſince your mediation is more like to procure him hatred then love, and you rather a meſſenger of war then peace. <hi>Stella,</hi> it's true, anſwered he, he was very ill adviſed in his choice; but if he had ſhewed as much judgment in the reſt of his actions, as in this, he would not have ſtood in need of your help; he has had tryall of your diſſimulations, he knowes what force your charmes have; and what friend could he have made choice of, without the danger of a competitor, unleſſe my ſelfe, whom you hate even unto death? But, let us leave this diſcourſe, and pray tell me plainly and in good earneſt, whether or no you will ſhew him any favour; for the truth is, I dare not return to him, unleſſe I carry a good anſwer with me, unto which I do conjure you, both by his affection that now is, and mine that was: Unto this, the Shepheard added ſo many arguments, and importunate prayers, as the Shepheardeſſe believed him to be in good earneſt; and her own naturall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition did eaſily encline her to it; for, it is the cuſtome of ſuch as eaſily love, to believe as eaſily that they are loved but <hi>Lyſis</hi> at this time could obtain no further from her, then that the affection of his couſin for want of his, ſhould not be diſagreeable unto her; but time ſhould adviſe her farther. And ſince this, <hi>Lyſis</hi> has ſeverall waies ſo ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her, that he got from her as much aſſurance as he deſired; and becauſe he was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her levitie, he obtained from her a promiſe in writing under her hand, and knew ſo well how to turn her, that he obtained of her whatſoever he deſired. Thus he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to me, and gave me an account of all he had done, except of this promiſe: for, knowing <hi>Stella's</hi> humour, he alwaies doubted ſhe would deceive him, and that if he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me this paper, it would imbarque me the more, and be harder to get me off. All this was unknown unto <hi>Amintha,</hi> from whom <hi>Stella</hi> concealed it more, then from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. After I had received ſo much aſſurance, as I could deſire no more, and after I had given her all humble and hearty thanks, I began, by her permiſſion, to take orders for the marriage, and ſpake it very freely and openly, though <hi>Lyſis</hi> alwaies foretold me, that in the end I ſhould be deceived. But, the very ſhadow of that good which we deſire does ſo flatter us, that we lend but a deaf ear unto any that ſhall tell us the contrary. Whilſt this Marriage was preparing, and publickly divulged, <hi>Semires,</hi> who, as I told you, diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his addreſſes by reaſon of <hi>Lyſis</hi> and me, he being netled with the diſcourſe which went of him, reſolved, at what rate ſoever, to infinuate himſelfe into her favour, with a deſigne to quit her afterwards, and make it appear, that this ſeparation proceeded from himſelfe: There needed no great artifice to bring this about, for her ſickle humour, according to its fleeting temper, did at the very firſt aſſault, quit me for <hi>Semires</hi> as a little before ſhe had quitted <hi>Semires</hi> for me: But for all that, the promiſe which ſhe had given under her hand, and which ſhe could not deny, did exceedingly ſtick in her ſtomack. At laſt, the Marriage day being come, and I had aſſembled together all my Parents, my Friends, and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, I held my ſelfe ſo ſure, as I thought upon nothing but bidding them welcome. But ſhe, whoſe thoughts were quite another away, when we came to the very point of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, ſhe ſtarted back, and formed excuſes far worſe then her firſt; at which I was ſo extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended, that I went away without ever bidding her adieu; and ever ſince I held her in ſuch diſdain, that ſhe could never infinuate her ſelfe again into my eſteem.</p>
               <p>Judge (reverend Father) whether or no I had good reaſon to hearken to her, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe who ſpeak in my diſadvantage be not wrongly informed. Truly, anſwered <hi>Adamas,</hi> ſhe is a woman that is unworthy of her name; and I do wonder, ſince ſhe has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded ſo many, that any man will ever truſt her. Nay Sir, ſaid <hi>Corilas,</hi> I have not yet told
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53526:41"/>
you all; for after every one was fallen from her except <hi>Lyſis,</hi> all her artifice was, how to get the promiſe which he had out of his hands, becauſe ſhe ſaw, that it was a great thorn in her ſide: Therefore with an impudent and diſſembling brow, ſhe thus ſpoke unto him, Is it poſſible <hi>Lyſis,</hi> (ſaid ſhe) you ſhould have loſt all that affection which you have ſo often vowed unto me? Is there no ſpark of love yet left in you? In me, (ſaid <hi>Lyſis)?</hi> no, I'le ſooner die. Upon this word, he went out of the houſe; but ſhe followed him ſo cloſe, as ſhe got hold of his hand, and holding it between hers, ſhe brought him back in ſuch an amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous poſture, as any would have judged them to be very loving; and though he knew her deluding humour well enough, yet could he not chuſe but be pleaſed with her flatteries, although he gave no faith unto them; and therefore thus ſaid unto her, Oh heavens, <hi>Stella!</hi> why do you ſo abuſe thoſe favours, which the heavens have ſo prodigally beſtowed upon you? Did but that fair body contain a ſoul that had any neer reſemblance unto it, who could poſſibly reſiſt it? She who knew well enough what charms were in her carreſſes, did uſe all the artifice of her eyes mouth, tongue, and all the invention ſhe had to make him melt, inſomuch as he was almoſt out of himſelfe; And at laſt ſhe came out with theſe words, Lovely Shepheard, (ſaid ſhe) if you be the ſame <hi>Lyſis</hi> who was once ſo ſweetly affectionate unto me; I beſeech you hearken unto theſe words, and believe them: and if you do finde any cauſe of complaint, I will make it evidently appear, that this which you eſteem as a ſecond fault, was committed only as a remedy for the firſt, which I will repair with all poſſible and deſirable ſatisfaction. Theſe ſmooth words wrought upon <hi>Lyſis,</hi> and did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him; yet, not to ſhew himſelfe ſo ſimply weak, he anſwered thus: <hi>Stella,</hi> I am ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous of all you ſay, as I believe not a ſyllable; and if I knew any thing which would diſpleaſe you, I would do it. If you would diſpleaſe me, ſaid the Shepheardeſſe, then come into the houſe. With that intention, I will, (anſwered he). Thus when they were entred into the houſe, and ſtood neer the fire, ſhe began thus; Now Shepheard, will I unmask the Riddle of all my diſſimulations with you, and make it moſt apparent, that poor <hi>Stella,</hi> whom you have accounted ſuch a leight huswife, is much more conſtant then you imagine her, and will let you plainly ſee, that in ſatisfaction of thoſe wrongs you have done me, that you have reaſon to confeſſe them, and be ſorry: But, ſaid ſhe, upon a ſuddain, what have you done with that promiſe which once you had of me, in favour of <hi>Corilas?</hi> for, if you have given it unto him, it will extreamly croſſe our deſignes. Who could poſſibly imagine, but that after all this, ſhe had loved <hi>Lyſis?</hi> So this Shepheard having an opinion, that ſhe would do that for him, which ſhe had refuſed me, he reſtored back unto her that promiſe, which he had ſo cloſely kept from me. Aſſoon as ever ſhe ſaw it, ſhe took it, and tore it all in pieces then threw it into the fire: Afterwards, turning towards <hi>Lyſis,</hi> &amp; laughing, ſhe thus ſaid unto him, Honeſt Shepheard, you may now be gon when you pleaſe, I know none that will hinder you, and it is very late. Oh heavens! (cryed out <hi>Lyſis,</hi> ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe over-reached) is it poſſible I ſhould be ſo ſimple, as to be gulled three times by one and the ſame perſon? What reaſon have you to ſay, ſaid <hi>Stella,</hi> that you are gulled? Oh! moſt perfidious woman, (ſaid he) did you not tell me, that you would make it appear, that your ſecond fault was committed, only to give ſatisfaction for the firſt? and to ſhew me that you were conſtant, you would diſcover your very heart and intentions to me?
<hi>Lyſis,</hi> ſaid ſhe, you are ſtill harping upon the wrong ſtring; pray tell me, wherein have I wronged you, if I did never love you, am I not conſtant, in not loving you ſtill? And do I not diſcover my heart and intentions to you, ſince now I have gotten that from you which I deſired, I give you free libertie to go home in peace? Could you think that all my words which I have given you for this houre together, tended to any other purpoſe, but to get this paper from you? and now I have it, I will bid you good-night, good <hi>Lyſis.</hi> You may imagine what creſtfallen Shepheard <hi>Lyſis</hi> was, when he heard all this; he was ſo damped, that he ſneaked away, and never gave one word. But ſince this, <hi>Semires</hi> revenged all our quarrells, and he who, as I told you was the cauſe of my miſery, or indeed, my happineſſe (for ſo may my ſeparation from her be called) he, I ſay, reſenting ſtill the firſt affront which ſhe put upon him, and conſidering her extream levity, as <hi>Lyſis</hi> and I were ſerved, ſo ſerved he her, and broke off the Marriage with her in the midſt of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which gave many an occaſion to ſay, That often ſhe who hurts another, receives her puniſhment by the ſame armes.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Corilas</hi> concluded: and <hi>Adamas</hi> in a ſmiling manner ſaid thus unto him, The beſt counſell I can give you is to fly this deluder; to beware of her fallacies, and to pleaſe your Parents who do ſo much deſire to ſee you married. When any good match is offered take
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53526:42"/>
it, and never inſiſt upon the circumſtances of Love; for nothing will ſooner waſh off theſe iſtains which this giddy woman has caſt upon your honour, nor ſooner purchaſe eſteem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt your neighbours, then to marry your ſelf not by Love but by Reaſon: for that is the greateſt action of your life; Upon which depends all the happineſſe or miſery of man. Upon theſe words they parted towards their ſeverall homes, for it began to be late.</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>Leonida</hi> not finding <hi>Adamas</hi> at home, ſhe went away again as ſoon as ever ſhe had dined: and becauſe ſhe was reſolved to ſtay all that night, with thoſe fair ſhephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes which ſhe had ſeen the day before, out of a deſire ſhe had to be more intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them, ſhe went to the place where ſhe found them before; and there ſhe eſpied one a farre off, but could not diſcerne who it was: yet drawing neere ſhe perceived it to be the ſame ſhe looked for. She might very well eſteem this as a happy meeting: for all theſe ſhepheardeſſes, as chance was, were come out of the Town purpoſely to paſs away all the reſt of the day together, to the end they might more freeely impart their ſecrets unto each other out of the reach of all eares. So as <hi>Leonida</hi> could never have come in a more opportune time to ſatisfie her curoſitie, then ſhe did: and ſtealing neer them ſhe heard <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> ſay unto <hi>Diana;</hi> Now wiſe ſhepheardeſſe I hope you will performe your promiſe unto <hi>Phillis</hi> and me, in acquainting us with your ſtory, ſince we have imparted ours unto you.</p>
               <p>Fair <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> my promiſe doubtles obligeth me unto it, but much more the amity that is betwixt us; knowing well that amongſt friends it is a crime impardonable to conceale any corner of their ſoules from each other: the only reaſon why it is ſo long before I have given you that ſatisfaction, beleeve it dear ſhepheardeſſe, was, becauſe time and leaſure would not permit it: And though I am certain, that I cannot relate the follies of my youth unto you without many bluſhes: yet that dificulty will eaſily be over come when I conſider that it is to pleaſe you: Why ſhould you bluſh at all (anſwered <hi>Phillis)</hi> ſince it is no crime to Love? If it be not one (replied <hi>Diana),</hi> yet it is ſuch a ſhadow of one, and ſo reſemblant as one is oft taken for the other. Such as are ſo deceived (anſwered <hi>Phillis)</hi> ſure have very ill eyes. Tis very true indeed, (ſaid <hi>Diana)</hi> but this is our miſery, that there is more bad eyes then good ones: we ſhall be very angry, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> if you think ours ſuch. The Love I beare unto you both (anſwered <hi>Diana)</hi> may aſſure you that I cannot make a wrong judgement of you: and I dare truſt you with my very ſoul: But ſhould I impart my ſelf ſo freely unto ſome, I ſhould find my actions meet with a wrong conſtruction: And therefore ſince it is your pleaſure and command, that I ſhould relate my life unto you, I do conjure you both, by all the ſacred Lawes of friendſhip, never to ſpeak of it again. Then both of them proteſting to bury all in eternall ſilence, ſhe thus began her diſcourſe.</p>

               <p>IT will be very ſtrange Fair and diſcreet ſhepheardeſſes, if this diſcourſe which you deſire ſhould be related, do not prove tedious unto you, ſince the relation I ſhall make, has not ſo many words it it, as it hath coſt me teares: but ſince it is your pleaſure I ſhould revive the ſad remembrance of them, I beſeech you give me leave to make it as ſhort as I can. I do aſſure my ſelfe, that though you have never ſeene either <hi>Celion</hi> or <hi>Belinda,</hi> yet you have heard that they were my Father and Mother; and perhaps have heard of the croſſes which they met withall for the Love of one another, which ſhall ſpare me the relating of them, though they were preſages of my enſuing miſeries. And be pleaſed to know, that after the heats of Love were a little cool'd by marriage, to the end they might not be idle, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to look narrowly into the buſineſſe of their eſtate, and had envolved themſelves into ſo many ſuites of Law, as they were forced to compoſe ſome of them, by mediation of friends. Amongſt the reſt, a neighbour of theirs called <hi>Phormion,</hi> did ſo trouble them, that to ſtop all thoſe gaps, their friends adviſed them to make ſome alliance with him: and becauſe neither of them had any children (neither having been long married) they both ſwore by <hi>Theutates</hi> upon the Altar of <hi>Belinus,</hi> that if they had but one Son and one Dauyhter, they ſhould Marry together: and this promiſe was confirmed by ſo many ſacred oathes, as he who broke them was the moſt perjured man in the world. A little after, my Father had a Son, who periſhed when the Goths and Oſtrogoths did ravage this Province. A little after that, I was born, but in ſuch an unhappy houre for me, that my Father never ſaw me, he dying before I was born. <hi>Phormion,</hi> ſeeing my Father dead, and my Brother loſt, (for
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53526:42"/>
thoſe barbarians, took him away, and either killed him, or let him ſtarve for want) and that my Uncle <hi>Diamis</hi> was gone away in diſpleaſure at this loſſe, he reſolved if he had a Son, to accompliſh their former promiſe. It happened a little after, that his wife was brought to bed, but it was of a Daughter, and fearing leſt he ſhould have no more chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by his wife, he cauſed it to be rumored, that it was a Son, and carried it ſo cunningly that none knew the contrary. And it was the more eaſie to be don, becauſe none believed that he would uſe any ſuch tricks: alſo, the better to colour the matter, he cauſed her to be named <hi>Philidas.</hi> Whom, when ſhe was grown to an age of practiſing ſuch excerciſes as young ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards uſe ſhe was not ill at them. <hi>Phormions</hi> deſigne was, that ſeeing me without Father, Brother and Uncle, to make himſelf Maſter of my eſtate, by this diſſembled marriage: and when <hi>Philidas</hi> and I were growen bigger, then to marry me unto one of his Nephews whom he loved very well: and truly he was not fruſtrated in his deſigne: for <hi>Belinda</hi> was too reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to be wanting in any duty to her husband. But yet, ſhe ſeeing me raviſhed away and gotten into their hands (for preſently upon this pretended marriage, I was ſeiſed into <hi>Phor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mions</hi> cuſtody) ſhe did ſo diſlike this courſe, as not being able to endure it, ſhe left the Country, and went into the Lake <hi>Lemane,</hi> to be Miſtreſſe of the Veſtalls and Druides of <hi>Emenes</hi> as the aged <hi>Cleontine</hi> did Propheſie by her Oracle. Meane while I was in the hands of <hi>Phormion,</hi> who preſently ſent for his Nephew, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> upon whom he intended to beſtow me, whoſe name was <hi>Amindor:</hi> here did begin my griefes: For <hi>Phormion</hi> his Uncle did let him underſtand that by reaſon of our nonage, the marriage of <hi>Philiduss</hi> and me, was not ſo aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but that if we two did not well agree, he could well enough break it off: and that if ſuch a thing ſhould be, he had rather ſhe ſhould marry me then any other; therefore he adviſed him to carry it with ſo much diſcretion as none ſhould take any notice of it, but ſtill to win upon my affection as much as he could, to the end I might beſtow my ſelf upon him when I was free. This young ſhepheard did ſo take this deſigne to heart, as he neglected no manner of courtſhip and complacency towards me. At the ſame time <hi>Daphnis</hi> a very handſom and diſcreet ſhepheardeſs returned from the confines of <hi>Furan,</hi> where ſhe had lived many yeares: and becauſe we were neigbours, our converſation made us ſuch friends as I began to be leſſe diſcontented then I was wont: for I muſt confeſſe that the humour of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidas</hi> was ſo diſpleaſing unto me, as I could hardly endure her: alſo her feares of my grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more knowing, made her ſo jealous of me, that I could hardly ſpeak unto any. Things being upon theſe tearms, <hi>Phormion</hi> fel ſuddenly ſick, and was ſo ſoon ſtuffed with a cattarh that he could neither ſpeak, nor give any order either about his own buſineſſe or mine. <hi>Philidas</hi> at the firſt was a little troubled; but afterwards ſeeing that ſhe was abſolute Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe of her ſelf and me alſo, ſhe reſolved to keep up this authority, conſidering that the libertie which the name of Man doth carry with it, was much more pleaſing then the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude of our ſex. Nor was ſhe inſenſible of that wonder which would be over all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, when ſhe ſhould declare her ſelfe to be a woman: upon theſe reaſons, ſhe continued in the ſame name and notion, which ſhe did when her Father was alive; and fearing more then ever, leſt ſome ſhould diſcover what ſhe was, ſhe kept me ſo neer her, as ſhe was ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never without me. But, Fair ſhpheardeſſes ſince you muſt know all my young fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. I muſt firſt begge your excuſes, and that you will know, I had ſo great an inclination to Love, another way: but that my heart was ſo hardned againſt <hi>Philadis</hi> and <hi>Amindor</hi> as love had not armes or arrowes ſtrong and ſharpe enough to peirce ſo much as my skin. But alas, it was the ſhepheard <hi>Filander,</hi> who had my heart; <hi>Filander</hi> who having given me ſome aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of his love, and now not being, has carried with him all that was mine; ſurely (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and interrupted her) either <hi>Filanders</hi> affection was very little, or elſe you did carry it with a great deale of prudence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I never ſo much as heard of it. Which is a thing very ſtrang. That it was not talked of, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> I am more obliged unto your good intentions then our prudence. And as for the affection of this ſhepheard, you may judge what it was, by my enſuing diſcourſe. And the heavens, who know our pure and cleere intentions, had a mind to favour them. The firſt time I ever ſaw him, was upon that day which we celebrated unto <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> when he came into thoſe ſports in the company of a Siſter, ſo extreamly like him that the eies of all the aſſembly were upon them. And becauſe he was neerely allyed unto my dear friend <hi>Daphnis,</hi> as ſoone as I ſaw her, I did ſo imbrace and carreſſe her as ever ſince ſhe thought her ſelf obliged to love me; Her name was <hi>Callirea,</hi> and was married unto a ſhepheard called <hi>Gereſtan,</hi> upon the confines of <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> whom ſhe had never ſeen untill the very day ſhe married him, which was a reaſon why there was but a very flender affection between them. My complacence to the Siſter gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53526:43"/>
unto the Brother to ſtand by me, as long as the ſacrifice laſted; and I cannot tell, whether to his good or bad fortune, but I had that day dreſſed up my ſelfe in my beſt trim, conceiving that my very name upon this feaſt, did more particularly oblige me to it, then any other. And he, being a ſtranger, and having no other acquaintance amongſt the Shepheards and Shepheardeſſes, than ſuch as his Siſter brought him, did not leave us all that day: So as, I conceiving my ſelfe in ſome ſort obliged to entertain him, I did what I could to pleaſe him, and my labour was not loſt; for, from that time, this poor Shepheard did begin ſuch affection to me as did not end till he died: And I am moſt confident, that if the dead have any remembrance of the living, he loves me ſtill; and in his aſhes preſerves that pure affection which he vowed unto me. <hi>Daphnis</hi> took notice of this, the very ſame day, and at night told me of it; but I did ſo long reject any ſuch thoughts, as ſhe was forced to ſay thus unto me. I ſee, <hi>Diana,</hi> you will not believe me; but, be aſſured, that <hi>Filander</hi> does extreamly love you. This advertiſment did ſo imprint it ſelfe in my minde, as the next day made me obſerve ſomthing, which induced me to be of her opinion: For, in the afternoons, we were accuſtomed to aſſemble under ſome ſhady tree, and ſitting round, to ſing. It chanced, that <hi>Filander</hi> having no acquaintance but <hi>Daphnis</hi> and me, he did ſit down between us, which <hi>Amindor</hi> taking notice of, did ſwell with ſuch a pittifull fit of jealouſie, that he, in a fuming chafe, left the company; and firſt looking upon me, as if it were I that he meant, he went away, ſinging this Catch.</p>

               <p>Many more did then expreſſe their ſeverall conceptions in verſe, but I have forgotten them: But ſo it was, that me thought <hi>Filanders</hi> words were aimed at me, and I cannot well tell, whether it was the hint which <hi>Daphnis</hi> had given me, or the language of his eyes, which ſpoke much more plain then his tongue: I cannot tell, but either the one, or both, made me apply this ſong to my ſelfe; and as theſe verſes did give me a little light of it, ſo his diſcretion did a little after, much more plainly teſtifie it unto me: For, it is the principall effect of a true affection, to carry it diſcreetly, and never to let it be known, but by thoſe effects which cannot be hid. This young Shepheard knew of <hi>Amindor's</hi> humour, and love had taught him ſo much curioſity, as to finde out, that his jealouſy was no leſſe than that of <hi>Philidas;</hi> and therefore he conceived, that the beſt way to blinde both their
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53526:44"/>
eyes, was, to court their friendſhip: and Love had made him ſo ſubtle and prudent, that in the carriage of the matter, he did not only deceive <hi>Amindor's,</hi> but almoſt all eyes elſe; for he would never come where we were, but ſuffered us alwaies to come unto him. 'Tis true, that crafty <hi>Daphnis</hi> did preſently finde it out; for, ſaid ſhe, <hi>Amindor</hi> is not a man of ſuch agreeable parts, as to attract unto him ſuch a well accompliſhed Shepheard as <hi>Filan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> but there muſt needs be ſome farther reach in all <hi>Filanders</hi> addreſſes to him; ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed did prompt me to take the firſt notice of it, and I muſt confeſſe, that his diſcretion did ſo pleaſe me, that if I would ſuffer any to love me, it ſhould be him; but, the time was not yet come, that I could be wounded this way, although his actions and carriage did pleaſe me, and though I did in ſome fore approve of his deſigne. When we at any time took our leaves of him, he would alwaies wait upon us a long way; and at parting, I never heard ſuch expreſſions of friendſhip, as he uſed to <hi>Amindor;</hi> nor ſuch offers of ſervice, as he ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred unto <hi>Philidas:</hi> Then would ſlie <hi>Daphnis</hi> whiſper me in the ear, and ſay, All theſe expreſſions are meant unto you, and you do him wrong if you do not anſwer him. And when he thanked <hi>Amindor</hi> for any favour, ſhe would ſay, Oh what a fool is he, to think, that theſe offerings are intended to his Altar? And he ſo well knew how to diſſemble, that he ſerued himſelfe into the very heart of <hi>Amindor:</hi> And <hi>Philidas</hi> was ſo tickled with his high commendations of her, as ſhe would often ſend, to deſire him he would come &amp; ſee her. Heavens knowes, how oft he had ſolicited for this opportunity, for it was as much as he could deſire, thinking his deſigne could not poſſibly have a better beginning. As fortune was, one day when <hi>Daphnis</hi> and I were walking under ſome ſhady trees, and talked our ſelves almoſt quite out of diſcourſe, we heard a voice, which at the firſt we thought to be of ſome ſtranger; the deſire of knowing who it was, made us draw towards the place, and <hi>Daphnis</hi> going firſt, ſhe eſpied <hi>Filander</hi> before me, and beckned unto me, that I ſhould tread gently; and when I was come neer her, ſhe named <hi>Filander</hi> in a low voice, who was laid down, leaning his head againſt a tree, and began thus, <hi>I ſhould defie and ſcorn Love, and all his policies and charms, did he not make uſe of my faireſt</hi> Diana's <hi>armes againſt me.</hi> And ſo went on.</p>
               <p>When I heard my ſelfe named, fair Shepheardeſſes, I trembled, and trode upon the ground, as if a Serpent were under my feet; and without any longer ſtay, I went away as gently as I could, leſt I ſhould be ſeen, though <hi>Daphnis,</hi> in hopes to make me come again, did let me go by my ſelfe: At laſt, ſhe ſeeing I continued on my way ſhe alſo ſtole ſoftly off, and afterwards ran after me as faſt me as faſt as ſhe could, and, when ſhe could hardly draw her breath, ſhe chid me in a very interrupted manner; but when ſhe had recovered her wind and could ſpeak plain, ſhe thus ſaid unto me: As I live <hi>Diana,</hi> if the heavens do not puniſh you, I ſhall think they are unjuſt: Could you be ſo cruell, as not ſo much as to lend him a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring? What good could I do unto him, (ſaid I) by ſtaying any longer there? You might have heard what hurt you have don him, ſaid ſhe unto me. I do him hurt, anſwered I? you do me wrong, in ſaying I could hurt one whom I never thought upon. Therein, ſaid ſhe, you hurt him moſt; for, did you ofter think upon him, you could not chuſe but be moved unto pitty. I bluſhed at that word, and the changing of my colour did make <hi>Daphnis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that I was offended with her, and therefore in a ſmiling manner, ſhe ſaid unto me, I did but jeaſt, <hi>Diana,</hi> and do not believe he thought upon you; and as for uſing your name, I believe he meant ſome other of the ſame name that yours is. Thus we went on talking and walking we knew not whither, untill another path had brought us unto the ſame place, where <hi>Filander</hi> was; and though I did it out of heedleſſneſſe, yet <hi>Daphnis</hi> perhaps did it out of deſigne, however, I was forced to look upon him lying upon the ground, leaning his head upon his arme, and ſeeming as if he were awake; for he had a Letter before him, all wet with tears which trickled down his cheeks: but, indeed he was aſleep and we were more aſſured of it, when <hi>Daphnis,</hi> more conſident then I, ſtooped gently down, and brought me the Letter, all ſteeped in tears, which ſight did much move me to pitty, and much more the Letter, which was thus written.</p>

If my raſhneſſe do merit puniſhment, remember, that I had rather love you, and die, than live, and not love you. But alas! why do I ſay, I had rather? as if it were in my choice; for I muſt out of a fatall neceſſitie be your moſt humble ſervant, and you muſt be what you are, which is, the faireſt Shepheardeſſe that ever lived: So as without any Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I muſt both live and die under this fatall, Muſt.</hi>

               <p>I had no ſooner read this Letter, but, with a trembling hand, I returned it, and <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> did gently put it in the place where ſhe found it: ſhe came ſoftly off without waking him, and coming unto me, who ſtood a pretty diſtance off; I pray, ſweet <hi>Diana,</hi> ſaid ſhe unto me, give me leave to ſpeak freely unto you. Our friendſhip <hi>Daphnis</hi> (anſwered I) does give you that power without the asking. Then, <hi>Diana,</hi> ſaid ſhe, I muſt tell you, that I do pitty <hi>Filander</hi> with all my heart, for moſt certainly he loves you; and your own ſoul, I'me ſure cannot deny it. <hi>Daphnis,</hi> (ſaid I unto her) let the faulty do the penance. If ſo, ſaid ſhe, then I'me ſure that <hi>Filander</hi> muſt not: for, I cannot allow it any fault to love you, but, I believe, his fault had been much greater if he had not loved you; for fair ones were made only to be loved. I dare appeal unto your judgment, anſwered I, whether I can pretend unto that title. But however, I do conjure you by our friendſhip, not to let him underſtand that I have any knowledge of his intention; and if you do love him, adviſe him never to mention it unto me: For eſteeming both him and <hi>Callirea</hi> his Siſter, as I do, I ſhould be very ſorry to baniſh him our company, which, you know, I ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto, if ever he ſpeak of it unto me. How then would you have him to live, ſaid ſhe unto me? I would have him live, replied I, as he did before he ever ſaw me. But that he cannot do, replied ſhe, for then he was not ſcorched with thoſe flames which now do burn him. Then, ſaid I, let him ſeek ſome remedy to quench thoſe flames, without offending me. The fire is great, added ſhe, and will not be quenched. Be the fire as great as it will, ſaid I, it will not burn him, if he will not come neer it. Although, anſwered ſhe, the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned uſe to flie the fire; yet, if he do flie, he will carry his fire with him, and the pain too. In concluſion I told her, that if it was ſo, then let him burn on, for I could not help him. With ſuch diſcourſe as this we returned towards our flocks, and at night to our lodgings, where we found <hi>Filander</hi> ſo carreſſed by <hi>Philidas,</hi> and <hi>Amindor</hi> alſo, that <hi>Daphnis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved he had bewitched them, it not being their humours to uſe others ſo. He ſtayed many daies amongſt us, and all that while, he made not the leaſt ſhew of any thing unto me, but lived in ſuch a diſcreet manner, that had not <hi>Daphnis</hi> and Iſeen, what we did, we had never entertained the leaſt ſuſpition of his intention. At laſt he was forced to depart, and not knowing what to reſolve upon, he went unto his Siſters houſe, for he loved her, and had as great a confidence in her, as in himſelfe. This Shepheardeſſe, as I told you, was married by force, and had no other contentment, but in the friendſhip of her Brother: As ſoon as ever ſhe ſaw him, after the firſt ſalute, ſhe was very inquiſitive to know from whence he came: and he anſwering, that he came from <hi>Philidas,</hi> ſhe asked him how <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> and I did: And he telling her alſo, ſpeaking very highly in my commendations; ſhe whiſpered him in the ear, and ſaid, I am afraid Brother, that you do love her better then you do me. He anſwered, that indeed he did love me, as my merits did oblige him to do. Then I have gueſſed right, (ſaid ſhe) for I know not a Shepheardeſſe in the whole world, that is owner of more merit; and I muſt confeſſe, that were I a man, I would, whether ſhe would or no, devote my ſelfe her ſervant. May I believe Siſter, ſaid he, that you ſpeak this in good earneſt? Yes truly Brother, anſwered ſhe, I will ſwear it, by that which is moſt dear unto me. Then I do believe, replied he, that if you were a man, you would have a hard task in hand; for, I perceive her to be of an humour that is not eaſily bended: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>Philidas</hi> and <hi>Amindor</hi> are ſo deadly jealous of her, as one or both of them are never out of her ſight. Oh deare Brother (cryed ſhe out) I plainly ſee that you are taken, ſince you have ſo preciſely obſerved theſe particulars, I do beſeech you conceal it no longer from me: for Love, if it be a fault is very pardonable: and ſhe was ſo importunate, that, after a thouſand proteſtations and ſuplications never to impart it, he confeſſed it unto her, and in ſuch paſſionate expreſſions, as ſhe could not poſſibly doubt it. And when ſhe asked him how I received this declaration? Oh heavens, ſaid he unto her, did you but know her humour you would ſay that never any did undertake a more difficult peece of buſineſſe. All
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53526:45"/>
that I have done hitherto, is to blind the eyes of <hi>Philidas</hi> and <hi>Amindor,</hi> making them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve there is none in the world more theirs then I am; and I have ſo well thriven in my deſigne upon them, as they were never well but when I was with them: then he made a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of all the paſſages unto her. But ſaid he, though I did intend to diſcover unto <hi>Diana,</hi> how much I was hers, yet ſuch an awing power ſhe had over me, as I never durſt, and I am afraid I never ſhall, only unleſſe a long continued practiſe ſhould embolden me, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it cannot be, but <hi>Philidas</hi> and <hi>Amindor</hi> will take notice of it: So as, deare Siſter, to tell you my condition, it is to tell you, that I am the very next dore unto deſpair. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirea</hi> who loved her Brother above all the world, was ſo ſenſible of his pain, that after ſhe had a while thought upon it, ſhe ſaid thus unto him. Brother, will yoube pleaſed to let me contribute my good will towards your ſatisfaction, and render you a teſtimonie of my forwardneſſe to ſerve you? Dear Siſter, anſwered he, though in this or any other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, I make no doubt of your good will: yet I am afraid of the ſucceſſe; how ever I ſhall entertaine any thing which comes from you.</p>
               <p>Then Brother, ſaid ſhe, I will go this way to work; you know what a reſemblance there is between our faces, our ſtatures, and our ſpeech, and were it not for a difference in habit, even thoſe that are continually with us, will take the one for the other: Now ſince the beſt way to compaſſe your deſign, is to keep about <hi>Diana</hi> without ſuſpition, can a more eaſie and ſecret way be deviſed, then for you to be taken for a woman? So may you keep <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> company without giving the leaſt ſuſpition of jealouſie unto <hi>Philidas,</hi> and I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne unto <hi>Gereſtan</hi> in your habit unto whom I will make an excuſe and ſay that <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> kept you with them by force. All the difficulty will be to get his leave to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, which I doubt will be very hardly obtained. Dear Siſter, ſaid <hi>Filander,</hi> I never made any doubt of your wit or dearneſs to me; and now I find you to be the beſt Siſter that ever man had, ſince you are pleaſed to take this paines upon you, which I moſt humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to do, and know, that it is the only way that can keep a Brother alive who loves you above himſelfe. Then did he imbrace her with all poſſible acknowledgments of obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which made her more willing to ſerve him then before: at laſt, ſhe ſaid thus unto him: Sweet Brother let us leave words to them that love leſſe, and let us think how to put our buſineſſe into action. I hope, ſaid he, it will eaſily be effected, if you can but obtain your Husbands leave, which I hope will alſo be effected, if you pretend that your journey is only with intentions to bring the match about, betwixt <hi>Amindor</hi> and his Neece, which he does very much deſire, and telling him that you make no doubt, but that you with the help of <hi>Daphnis</hi> ſhall in time bring it to paſſe. But what courſe ſhall we take with our hair? for yours is too long, and mine too ſhort, and therefore I doubt will much trouble us: Never take care for that, ſaid I unto him: for yours is long enough to be dreſſed up like mine; and I will circumciſe mine into your cut. But, dear Siſter, ſaid he unto her, will it not grieve you to part ſo with your hair? No Brother, anſwered ſhe, there is nothing ſo dear unto me, which I would not part with to procure your contentment, though it were my very skin. At this word he imbraced her, and told her that next unto god ſhe would be his great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer from his torments. Then <hi>Filander,</hi> to loſe no time, tooke the firſt opportunitie that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it ſelfe, of talking with <hi>Gereſtan,</hi> repreſenting unto him the advantage and feaſibilitie of bringing this match about: and becauſe <hi>Filander</hi> deſired ſo much time as to let his hair grow a little longer, he pretended a journey about the diſpatch of ſome buſineſs, and would ſhortly return. But <hi>Philidas</hi> no ſooner heard of <hi>Philanders</hi> return, than ſhe went to viſit him accompanied only with <hi>Amindor,</hi> and would not part with him before they brought him unto us, where he ſtayed ſeaven or eight dayes and was not any bolder to declare himſelfe unto me than at the firſt.</p>
               <p>During which time, to ſhew how hard a thing it is to conſtrain nature long; although <hi>Philidas</hi> did counterfeit the Man as well as ſhe could for her life, yet was ſhe forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the paſſions of a woman: and the addreſſes and merits of <hi>Filander</hi> wrought ſuch effects in her, as he deſired they had wrought in me.</p>
               <p>Thus the poor <hi>Philidas</hi> was ſo much beſides her ſelf, that ſhe could not live out of <hi>Filanders</hi> fight, and did apply her ſelfe ſo unto him, as did amaze him, and had not his deſires of being neer me reſtrayned him, he would never have endured that kind of life. At laſt when he thought his hair was reaſonably well grown, he returned to <hi>Gereſtan,</hi> and told him that he had already broken the Ice of the buſineſſe, but <hi>Daphnis,</hi> did think it expedient to ſee his Neece before ſhe ſpoke in the buſineſſe, and likewiſe that <hi>Amindor</hi> alſo ſaw her, and therefore ſhe thought the beſt courſe was to let <hi>Callirea</hi> carry her thither, and ſhe to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53526:45"/>
ſhew her ſelfe as complaiſant as ſhe could unto <hi>Amindor</hi> and the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gereſtan</hi> who deſired nothing more then to be rid of his Neece did hearken unto this propoſition with a very willing eare and did peremptorily command his wife to make her ſelf ready for the voyage, who to make him more eager upon it, did ſeem to be a little unwilling, and ſhewed ſome ſignes of ſorrow to part from her Husband, ſaying that ſuch buſineſſe as this, might be wel enough effected without her, and that it would take up a great deale of time, which might better be ſpent in her houſhould affaires. But <hi>Gereſtan</hi> who would have her will to yeeld to his in all things, was ſo extreamly hot upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that three dayes after, ſhe departed with her Brother and her Neece. The firſt dayes Jorney was to <hi>Filanders,</hi> where they changed habits, which ſo well fitted each other, that even thoſe in their company could not perceive the change: And I muſt confeſſe I was deceived as wel as they, and found no manner of difference betwixt them. But well might I be deceived, when <hi>Philidas</hi> was, who looked upon him with the eyes of Love, which they ſay are more obſervant then all the eyes of <hi>Linx:</hi> for as ſoon as they came, ſhe left the faign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Callirea,</hi> I mean <hi>Filander,</hi> and carried the true into a chamber to reſt her ſelf. All the way as they came, <hi>Filander</hi> inſtructed his Siſter in all paſſages, and how ſhe ſhould find the perſons with whom ſhe was to tranſact; now though <hi>Callirea</hi> was reſolved to undergo all difficulties, for her Brothers contentment: yet thinking <hi>Philidas</hi> to be a man, it went much againſt the hair of her mind to talk with her. As for us, when <hi>Daphnis</hi> and I were retired, we treated <hi>Filander</hi> with all the civilities that are uſed amongſt women, I mean, ſuch as either amitie or privacie requires, which that ſhepheard did receive with much Jollitie; and as he hath ſince ſworn to me, he was almoſt tranſported beſides himſelfe. Had I not been a meer child in matter of obſervation, certainly his actions and behaviour would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered him unto me: but the truth was, ſhee did counterfeit the matter ſo exceeding well, that <hi>Daphnis</hi> was deceived as well as I: while we retired into our chambers after ſupper <hi>Callirea</hi> and <hi>Philidas</hi> did walk into the chamber. I know not what their diſcourſe was, but ours was nothing but aſſurance of amitie and cordiall expreſſions of affection, which <hi>Filander</hi> uſed in ſuch a paſſionate way as it was eaſie to judge, that though ſhe would have ſaid nothing, yet he could not be blamed for want of any good wil, but for the want of boldneſſe.</p>
               <p>For my part I was extreamly free in my expreſſions alſo; for beleeving him to be a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I thought my ſelfe to be obliged unto it, by his expreſſions of good will to me, by his merits, and by the kindred of her and <hi>Daphnis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this time, <hi>Amindor,</hi> who before bore me much good will, began to change his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection &amp; to love the faigned <hi>Callirea:</hi> And <hi>Filander</hi> fearing his demeans would not pleaſe this young man, did ſtrive as much as poſſibly he could to comply with him: and the fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humour of <hi>Amindor,</hi> would not let him receive ſuch favours, without being in Love. Which I do not at all think ſtrange: For the beauty, the judgement, and deportment of <hi>Filander</hi> was ſuch, as that he came nothing ſhort in the perfections of a woman, ſo as he might well delude any man.</p>
               <p>Obſerve what a wanton Love is; and how he ſports and ſpends his time! He made <hi>Philidas</hi> who was a woman to love a woman, and <hi>Amindor</hi> who was a man to love a man, and that ſo extream paſſionatly that this very particular was ſubject enough to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of. <hi>Filander</hi> he knew how to play the woman moſt admirably; and <hi>Callirea</hi> did ſo well counterfeit her Brother, and neither of them wanted prudence to carry out the matter.</p>
               <p>That cold demeanure which <hi>Callirea</hi> ſhewed unto me, removed all cauſes of jealouſie out of <hi>Philidas,</hi> and beſides <hi>Philidas</hi> did love her; and I muſt confeſſe, that ſeeing her ſo fall off from <hi>Philidas,</hi> from <hi>Daphnis,</hi> and from me, we had an opinion, that <hi>Filanders</hi> mind was changed: at which I much rejoyced, by reaſon of the amity I bore unto his Siſter. Seaven or eight dayes were thus ſpent, and none did think them one jot too long; for, every one of us had a particular deſigne. But <hi>Callirea,</hi> who feared, leſt her Husband ſhould be angry at this long ſtay, did ſolicit her Brother to make known his deſign unto me, telling him, that it was not likely I ſhould refuſe his ſervice, ſince he bad been ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with me: But for all that, he had not yet the confidence to declare himſelfe: Yet, to delude <hi>Gereſtan,</hi> he deſired her to go unto her Husband in that dreſſe wherein ſhe was, aſſuring her, that he could not finde any difference between them; and to let him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that by the advice of <hi>Daphnis,</hi> ſhe had left <hi>Callirea</hi> with <hi>Philidas,</hi> to treat with <hi>Amindor</hi> about the marriage of his Niece.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:53526:46"/>
This propoſition at the firſt did aſtoniſh his Siſter; for, her Husband was a piece of angry fleſh, and the leaſt diſguſt would move him unto paſſion. At the laſt, her deſires to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent her Brother in every thing, did move her to yield unto the motion: And to render this excuſe more colourable, they did ſpeak unto <hi>Daphnis</hi> concerning <hi>Amindors</hi> marriage, which, for divers conſiderations, ſhe rejected; but, knowing that this buſineſſe was their pretence, under which they got leave to come this journey, and without which they never had obtained it; <hi>Daphnis,</hi> who was well pleaſed with their company, did communicate the matter unto me; and we all agreed, that the beſt way was, to ſeem, as if the project were feaſible: And in order to that, <hi>Daphnis</hi> did write unto <hi>Gereſtan,</hi> adviſing him to let his Wife to ſtay a little longer amongſt us, the better to effect the buſineſſe, and that ſhe hoped all things would be brought to a happy iſſue.</p>
               <p>Upon this Embaſſie, and thus clad, <hi>Callirea</hi> went unto her Husband, who being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled by her dreſſe, as well as the reſt, he took her for her Brother, and liked the cauſe of his wifes ſtay ſo well, that he willingly conſented unto the motion upon thoſe termes. Judge, fair Shepheardeſſes, whether I might not well be deceived, ſince her own Husband was, and could not diſtinguiſh them.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Filanders</hi> affection grew to that height, that he could no longer conceal it, do what he could; and therefore he told me, that though he was a woman, yet he could not chuſe, but be extreamly in love with me, and ſhould be much more, were he a man; and expreſſed himſelfe ſo very paſſionately, that <hi>Daphnis,</hi> who loved me very well, did ſay, that untill then, ſhe never knew it; but that ſhe her ſelfe was alſo in love me: which was no ſtranger, then that <hi>Philidas</hi> ſhould love <hi>Filander.</hi> And this diſguiſed <hi>Callirea</hi> prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, that the chiefe reaſon why ſhe did conſtrain her Brother to go, was this match which was propounded; for which many ſo reaſons were ſhewed me, that I eaſily believed it to be ſo. Being thus ſatisfied with this excuſe, ſhe ſpoke of her paſſion unto me, without any difficulty, but ſtill as a woman and vowing unto me, that the very ſame reſentments and paſſions which uſe to be in men that were in love, were in her, and that it was a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation unto her to expreſſe them.</p>
               <p>Twelve or fifteen daies thus paſſed, with ſo much delighting ſatisfaction unto <hi>Filan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> as he hath ſince ſworn unto me, that he never ſpent his daies more happily, although his deſires did ſwell him with abundance of impatiency, which yet did daily augment his paſſion: And pleaſing himſelf in theſe thoughts, he would very often walk alone to entertain them: Now, becauſe he was ſeldome from us in the day time, he would often make uſe of the night, when he thought all aſleep, and go into the Garden, where, under ſome trees, he would enjoy his thoughts; and uſing often to go out thus, <hi>Daphnis</hi> took notice of it, who lay in the ſame Chamber: And as commonly the worſe, rather then the better, is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, ſhe was jealous of <hi>Amindor</hi> and her; but, for her ſatisfaction ſhe would watch; and watched ſo, that ſeeing the diſguiſed <hi>Callirea</hi> go out of his Bed, ſhe followed him by the light of the Moon into the Garden, where juſt under my Chamber window, ſhe ſaw him ſit down, and lifting up his eyes unto heaven, ſhe heard him ſay thus aloud:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Even as the Moon doth quite outſhine,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>And dimn another ſtar;</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>So my</hi> Diana, <hi>moſt divine,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Tranſcends all beauties far.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
               <p>Though <hi>Filander</hi> uttered theſe words loud enough, yet <hi>Daphnis</hi> was ſo far off, that ſhe could not hear, but here and there a word, and therefore ſhe ſtepped neerer as gently as ſhe could, though he was ſo taken up with his own imagination, that, had ſhe walked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, he had hardly ſeen her, as ſince he told me. Aſſoon as ſhe had gotten her ſelfe neer him, ſo as ſhe could hear him ſigh, ſhe heard him ſay in a low voice to himſelfe, How unreaſonable is my partiall fate, that hath made her worthy of all ſervices, and yet me not worthy to ſerve her? And that ſhe ſhould not accept of their affections who do love her; yet, to inſpire them with extream paſſions. Ah <hi>Callirea!</hi> how pernitious proves thy plot unto thy tranquillitie? and how art thou puniſhed for thy bold preſumption? <hi>Daphnis</hi> did hearken unto <hi>Filander</hi> very attentively; but though he ſpoke loud and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct enough, yet, her prejudicated conceit of his being <hi>Callirea,</hi> would not ſuffer her to comprehend his meaning: But afterwards her curious ear heard him utter theſe words, But Oh, preſumptuous <hi>Filander,</hi> what excuſe cauſt thou finde for thy fault? and what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53526:46"/>
can equall thy offence? Thou doſt love this Shepheardeſſe, yet, how durſt thou be ſo imprudently bold, as to offer this injury unto her? At this word he ſtopt; but ſtill his eyes and his ſighs did expreſſe the extremity of his paſſion: And to divert his ſad thoughts, or rather to flatter them, he ſtarted up upon a ſuddain to walk, and ſpied <hi>Dapl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> though ſhe, to conceal her ſelfe, did run away; but, becauſe he was reſolved to know who it was, he ran after her, and at the corner of the little wood overtook her; and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that now ſhe had diſcovered all, which he had ſo cloſely concealed, in a kinde of halfe anger, he ſaid unto her, What, <hi>Daphnis,</hi> makes you ſo full of curioſity, as ſo to ſpie out my actions in the night? It is (anſwered <hi>Daphnis</hi> in a ſmiling manner) to get that out of you by craft, which otherwiſe I could not: And this ſhe thought ſhe had ſpoken unto <hi>Callirea,</hi> not having yet diſcovered that he was <hi>Filander.</hi> Well then (replied <hi>Filander,</hi> thinking he had been diſcovered) what great Novelties have you learn'd by it? All, ſaid <hi>Daphnis,</hi> that I deſire to know. Then (ſaid <hi>Filander)</hi> your curioſity is ſufficiently ſatisfied. So well, anſwered ſhe, that I ſee, all your diligence about <hi>Diana,</hi> and all the great affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which you make a ſhew of unto her, will in the end be repayed with grief and vek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Oh heavens! (cryed out <hi>Filander)</hi> I ſee I am diſcovered: But wiſe and diſcreet <hi>Daphnis,</hi> ſince you do now know the cauſe of my being here with <hi>Diana,</hi> you have in your hands both my life and my death: But ſurely if you do conſider how much I am yours, and how ready I was ever to ſerve you upon all occaſions, I hope you rather wiſh my contentment and happineſſe, than my deſpair and ruine. <hi>Daphnis</hi> ſtill thought it to be <hi>Callirea</hi> that ſpoke, and had a conceit, that all theſe fears proceeded from <hi>Gereſtan,</hi> who would have taken it very ill, his Wife ſhould do any ſuch office for her Brother; but to ſatisfie him, ſhe ſaid, <hi>Callirea,</hi> you need not to make any queſtion of me; for, I am ſo well acquainted with your buſineſſe, that I would have contributed my beſt counſell and aſſiſtance, though you had never ſpoke unto me; but, that I may the better ſerve you, I beſeech you acquaint me with the whole buſineſſe, to the end your freedome towards me, may the more oblige me, and your miſtruſt of me may not offend me. I will, dear <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> ſaid he, upon condition you promiſe me to ſay nothing unto <hi>Diana,</hi> untill I conſent unto it. This requeſt, anſwered the Shepheardeſſe, might have been well ſpared; for ſuch is her humour, that I would never adviſe you to truſt her with it. Hence is my griefe, ſaid <hi>Filander;</hi> for I do already ſo well know it, that I do think my deſigne almoſt an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility: For at the firſt, when my Siſter and I reſolved to change habits, ſhe aſſuming mine, and I hers, I did then foreſee that all the advantage I ſhould get by it, was, that I might with more freedome be neer her a while in that diſguiſe, and not be taken for <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander.</hi> How's this (ſaid <hi>Daphnis,</hi> all amazed) for <hi>Filander?</hi> Are not you <hi>Callirea?</hi> The Shepheard, who thought ſhe had known him before, was now very ſorry that he had ſo raſhly diſcovered himſelfe; but ſeeing it was now paſt, and that there was no revocation of his words, he bethought himſelfe how to make the beſt uſe of it he could, and therefore ſaid thus unto her, You ſee <hi>Daphnis,</hi> that I do cleerly truſt you with all my hopes, and have freely diſcovered the greateſt ſecret of my ſoul unto you; a ſecret of ſuch importance, that if any beſides your ſelfe ſhould know it, all my hopes are dead fore ever; therefore I do put my ſelfe, and all my happineſſe into your hand, ſo, as you muſt either become my friend, or elſe I muſt die. Know therefore <hi>Daphnis,</hi> that here you ſee before you <hi>Filander,</hi> in the habit of his Siſter; and that love in me, and compaſſion in her, hath cauſed us thus to diſguiſe our ſelves. Afterward he related unto her his extream affection, his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with <hi>Amindor</hi> and <hi>Philidas,</hi> the invention of <hi>Callirea,</hi> her reſolution to go unto her. Husband in a mans habit: and, in ſhort, all the paſſages, with all poſſible demonſtrations of love: So as though <hi>Daphnis</hi> did wonder at the bold attempt of him, and his Siſter; yet, ſhe ſaw the grandure of his affection, which might well lead him unto ſuch follies: Yet, had ſhe been of their counſell at the firſt, ſhe would not have adviſed unto this enterprize; but, ſeeing things did hit ſo happily, ſhe reſolved to aid him all that poſſibly ſhe could, and to ſpare no pains nor care to effect his deſires: After which promiſes, with many aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances of amitie, ſhe gave him the beſt advice ſhe could, which was, to inſinuate himſelfe by degrees into my affection For, ſaid ſhe, the very word of Love does more offend a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, than the thing it ſelfe doth; and it is alwaies very welcome unto any, ſo the name of it be hid. Therefore I think them to be well adviſed, who do make themſelves loved of their Miſtreſſes, before ever they ſpeak of Love; for Love is a thing diſpleaſing only in the name, though in it ſelfe it be agreeable unto all. And therefore, that you may finde a more favourable reception from <hi>Diana,</hi> you muſt not ſo much as name Love, no, nor to let her ſee
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53526:47"/>
it, but muſt carry the matter ſo diſcreetly, that ſhe may firſt love you, as ſoon as ever ſhe ſhall know that you love her; for, ſhe being once embarqued, ſhe cannot afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to the Port, although ſhe ſhould ſee a ſtorm in coming. Me thinks hitherto you have carried it with very much prudence, but you muſt ſtill continue it: The ſeeming to be in love with her, although you ſeem a woman, is to very good purpoſe; for certainly, any Love that is once ſuffered, will in the end produce a reciprocall return.</p>
               <p>We ſee, that we do many things with much facility, which would ſeem full of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, if the cuſtome of doing them, did not render them eaſie unto us. Meats unaccuſtomed, are often at the firſt diſguſted, which afterwards are pleaſant by uſe. An ear that is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to Muſick, will tune the voice higher or lower unto a right harmonious caden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; when one that is not uſed to the Art, will make a jar. So a Shepheardeſſe, who often heares the well tun'd talk of a Lover, will, in time, make her ſoul ply unto the harmoy of it and in time, will incline inſenſibly to the reſentments of Love; my meaning is ſhe will love the company of that perſon, and by little and little begin to pitty his pain and at laſt, before ſhe be aware, will love him. Judge <hi>Filander,</hi> by theſe inſtructions, whether or no I love you, and have pitty of you, ſince I do diſcover unto you the ſecrets of our School: and receive this advice as an earneſt of what I deſire to do for you.</p>
               <p>With ſuch diſcourſe as this, the day beginning to draw on, they returned into the houſe, laughing at the love of <hi>Amindor,</hi> who took him for a woman: And falling aſleep again, to recompenſe the laſt nights loſſe, they did lie in bed long in the morning, which gave the young <hi>Amindor</hi> an opportunity of ſurpriſing them; and had not I entred at the ſame time into the chamber, I believe the jugling had been diſcovered: for, he going to the ſuppoſed <hi>Callirea's</hi> bed-ſide, his love began to be a little too licentious, and his raſh &amp; indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet hands had like to have gon too far; but, <hi>Daphnis</hi> deſired me to take him off, &amp; to part them; which I did, with no ſmall contentment to <hi>Filander,</hi> who, by way of thanks, kiſſed my hand ſo affectionately, as if I had any ſenſe in me, I might have known him to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in love. Afterwards, bidding them good morrow, I carryed <hi>Amindor</hi> away with me, that they might have time to dreſſe themſelves. And becauſe they intended to put their propoſed deſigne into execution, preſently after dinner, when we all, according to our cuſtome, aſſembled under a ſhade of trees, to enjoy the cool air; although <hi>Amindor</hi> was there, yet, <hi>Daphnis</hi> conceived the opportunity to be good: for, to hear ſuch diſcourſe in his preſence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> would remove all manner of ſuſpition, and he would not think it ſtrange, if afterwards he ſhould by chance hear <hi>Filander</hi> ſpeak like a man unto me. <hi>Daphnis</hi> then beckening unto <hi>Filander,</hi> to the end he ſhould ſecond her in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, ſhe thus ſaid unto him, What is it, <hi>Callirea,</hi> that makes you ſo mute in <hi>Diana's</hi> company? The reaſon is, anſwered he, becauſe I am thinking what wiſhes I ſhould make, that might make me more ſervicable unto my Miſtreſſe; and amongſt the reſt, I had one, which, I think, I ought not to deſire. What is it, ſaid <hi>Amindor?</hi> It is, ſaid <hi>Filander,</hi> that I were a man that I might render more acceptable ſervice unto the fair <hi>Diana.</hi> Why, ſaid <hi>Daphnis,</hi> are you in love with her? Yes, anſwered <hi>Filander,</hi> and infinitely more then I am with all the world beſides. I ſhould ſooner wiſh (ſaid <hi>Amindor)</hi> that you were a woman again, both for my ſake, and for <hi>Philidas.</hi> It is not the conſideration of either of them (ſaid <hi>Filander)</hi> ſhall make me change my wiſh, Why, (ſaid <hi>Daphnis)</hi> do you think that <hi>Diana</hi> would love you better? I ſhould hope ſo, ſaid <hi>Filander,</hi> and the Lawes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would oblige her to it; unleſſe, as in her beauty ſhe tranſcends her power, ſo ſhe ſhould in, her humour diſdain her ordinances. You may think what you pleaſe of me, (ſaid I unto him) but if you will believe me, there is not a man upon earth that I do love more then you. Alſo, replyed he, there is none that breathes, which is more devoted to your ſervice then I But fair <hi>Diana,</hi> that happineſſe you mention, will laſt no longer, then untill you ſhall diſcover the poorneſſe of my merit; or, untill ſome better object preſent it ſelfe. Do you think me, replied I, of ſuch a wavering temper? It is not, Faireſt, that I think you guilty of the ſin of inconſtancy, replied he; but it is becauſe I am conſcious, that the fault is in my ſelfe. The fault is more on my ſide, anſwered I: And upon this word, I did embrace him, and kiſſe him, with as much ſincere affection, as if he had been my ſiſter. Hereupon <hi>Daphnis</hi> ſmiled in her ſelfe, to ſee me ſo deceived. But <hi>Amindor,</hi> jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous (as I think) of us both, did interrupt us; I think (ſaid he) that all this is in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and that <hi>Callirea</hi> does not diſſemble. I diſſemble, ſaid he? Heaven puniſh me more then ever perjury was puniſhed, if ever any love was more paſſionate or ſincere, than mine to <hi>Diana.</hi> If you were a man, (ſaid <hi>Daphnis)</hi> do you think you could expreſſe your paſſion
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53526:47"/>
in the language of a man? Though I muſt confeſſe (ſaid he,) that my wit and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is but very ſhallow; yet I beleeve I ſhould not ſtand mute upon ſuch an occaſion, for my extream affection would prompt me, &amp; ſupply all other defects. I beſeech you, fair one' (ſaid <hi>Amindor)</hi> let us ſee how you could behave your ſelfe upon ſuch an occaſion. If my Miſtris will give me leave (ſaid <hi>Filander</hi>) I will; but yet upon condition that ſhe will grant me three requeſts: The firſt is, that ſhe will anſwer unto what I ſhall ask her: The ſecond, that ſhe will not think, what I ſhall preſent unto her under another perſon then <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirea,</hi> to be fained, but take them as moſt reall and true, though impuiſſant paſſions. And the laſt is, that ſhe will never permit any but my ſelfe to ſerve her in this kind. I ſeeing every one delighted with the motion, and alſo really loving <hi>Filander</hi> under the notion of his Siſter, did anſwer him, that for his ſecond and laſt requeſt, they were granted as ſoon as deſired; but as for the firſt, I was ſo unaccuſtomed to anſwer all queſtions, as I was ſure they would be but unpleaſing. Yet becauſe I would not be refractory in any thing, I ſaid that I would acquit my ſelfe as well as I could. Upon this word he took me by the hand, and began thus.</p>
               <p>I could never have beleeved, Fair Miſtris, conſidering the tranſcendency of your perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that any mortall durſt have loved you, had I not experimentally found in my ſelfe, that it is impoſſible to look upon you and not Love. But knowing the heavens to be more Juſt than to impoſe impoſſibilities upon any, I tooke it for granted, that they would have you loved, becauſe they ſuffered you to be ſeen. In this beleefe, I aſſumed the boldneſſe to look upon you, which I had no ſooner done, but my heart immediatly ſubmitted. The Law permits one to goe and diſpoſe of their own; take it not ill, Fair ſhepheardeſſe, that I give you my heart, which if you refuſe, I ſhall for ever diſavow it to be mine. Here he ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, to ſee if I would anſwer him; but in ſuch a manner, that had not his habit diſguiſed him, I could not have doubted but that he was in good earneſt. And becauſe I would be as good as my promiſe, I anſwered him thus; Shepheardeſſe, were all theſe high applauds which you beſtow upon me true, perhaps then I ſhould think they proceeded from your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to me; but knowing them to be meer flatteries, I muſt needs think the reſt no better then diſſimulation. This, Fair one, ſaid he, does too much diſparage your judgement for it is impoſſible to make any doubt of your perfections and merit, but I rather think, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you are uſed with ſuch excuſes to deny ſuch things as you are not pleaſed to grant. But I am able and with all truth to ſwear, by <hi>Teutates,</hi> and all thats holy (and you may know I am not forſworne) that you did never in all your life refuſe any thing that was given you with a more ſincere and perect good will. I do know very well, anſwered I, that the ſhepheards of this Country are accuſtomed to ſuch language as has little truth in it, nor do they think that the gods will puniſh all the perfidious oathes of ſeeming lovers. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no it be the peculiar vice of your ſhepheards (ſaid he) I referre it unto your knowledge. But for my ſelfe who am not of this country, I am not guilty either of their ſhame or crime: but will out of your moſt cruell words draw ſome ſatisfaction to my ſelfe. If the gods do puniſh the oaths of perfidious lovers, and if I be guiltiy, then the gods will ſend the puniſhment of perjurie upon me: and if they do not, then you muſt be forced to confeſſe, that ſince I am not puniſhed, I am no lyer. And if I be no lyer, then you muſt confeſſe I am your lover. So let your wit turne it which way you will, it cannot be denyed but that you are the faireſt upon earth, or elſe there is none in it; and that your beauty is infinitly adored, by that ſhepheard who preſents himſelfe before you, and who implores your favour, which he thinks he may merit, if a moſt perfect love could ever do it. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am fair or no, replyed I, I will be judged by any indifferent eyes: but how ever you cannot deny that you do diſſemble and are perjured: and I muſt tell you <hi>Callirea,</hi> that theſe expreſſions which you have uſed as a man ſhall make me reſolve, never to credit any words, ſince you being a woman do know how ſo wel to diſſemble. Why <hi>Diana</hi> do you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt the diſcourſe of your Servant? (ſaid he and ſmiled:) do you wonder that <hi>Callirea</hi> ſhould expreſſe ſo much affection to you? No no, it is abſolutly impoſſible to diminiſh or increaſe, for it is moſt violent &amp; ſhall be eternall. I will in ſpite of oppoſition love you, &amp; Love you to my grave, and in my grave alſo if it be poſſible; as <hi>Tiriſias</hi> being a woman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a man, why may I not hope, that the gods may as well change me? Beleeve it (Fair <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana)</hi> that ſince the gods never made any thing in vaine, it is not likely they ſhould inſpire me with a moſt perfect affection to no purpoſe. <hi>Daphnis</hi> ſeeing this diſcourſe went a little too farr, and was daingerous, becauſe this Lovers paſſion had a little tranſported him, and might diſcover him unto <hi>Amindor:</hi> ſhe did interrupt him, and ſaid; Doubtleſſe, <hi>Callirea,</hi>

your love is not in vain, ſince it is imployed to ſerve this ſhepheardeſſe, no more then a candle conſumes it ſelfe in vaine, which gives light unto all about it: For all the world adores her as well as you, and you do moſt excellently imploy your time if it be in her ſervice. Come come (ſaid <hi>Amindor)</hi> let us leave this diſcourſe, ſee where <hi>Philidas</hi> comes who though he be a man, yet he will take no delight in it: Then <hi>Philidas</hi> came, and every one roſe to ſalute him.

Then taking her by the arme and ſeeing none within hearing began to ſay thus unto her: Is it poſſible, fair <hi>Callirea,</hi> that the language wherein you expreſſed your ſelfe unto <hi>Diana,</hi> ſhould proceed from your heart? Or did you uſe them only to ſhew the acuteneſſe of your wit? Beleeve me, <hi>Amindor,</hi> anſwered <hi>Filander,</hi> I am no lyer, and the expreſſion of my affection to her, was the very thoughts of my heart, and if there be any want of truth in it, it was only want of words to expreſſe my reſentments. Unto which with a deep ſigh, he anſwered thus. Since it is ſo, fair <hi>Callire<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And therefore I ſhall uſe no other language to expreſſe my ſelfe unto you but what you uſed unto <hi>Diana;</hi> only add this conſideration unto you, to the end you may know the grandure of my Love, that if the blow may be judged of by the ſtrength of the arm that gave it, then my wound muſt needs b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Shepheard, anſwered <hi>Filander</hi> your declarations of any Love to me, are both unjuſt and very offenſive unto me, who have a husband that will not with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſuffer ſuch affront if he knew it. Moreover, ſince you ſpeak of <hi>Diana,</hi> unto whom, I have wholly dedicated my ſelfe, I muſt tell you, that if you will have me meaſure your affection by mine, according to the cauſes which we have to love, I cannot beleeve you have much; ſince what you call beauty in me, is not worthy to retain the name of it, if compa<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> himſelfe, could hardly endure to heare me thus un lervalued; but having a deſigne not to diſcover himſelf, he had ſo much power over himſelf as to put it up and thus anſwered him. How is it poſſible <hi>Amindor</hi> (ſaid he.) that your tongue should ſo much bely your heart? Can you think I do not know that you diſſemble? And that all this while your affection is devoted unto <hi>Diana?</hi> My affection (replyed he, as if ſurpriſed) Nono, that is wholly yours: may never any love me, if I love any but you: I cannot ſay but heretofore I have wiſhed her well, but her humour is ſo full of inequalitie, ſomtimes all fire, and ſomtimes all Ice, that now I am very indifferent towards her. I wonder ſaid <hi>Filan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> how you dare to ſay ſo, for I know ſhe loves you, and you ſtill love her? I will not deny ſaid <hi>Amindor</hi> but that ſhe may love me, but who cares. This was right according to <hi>Amindors</hi> humour, which was ever full of vanitie, and would have all men beleeve, that he could have many good fortunes: At this time <hi>Filander</hi> found out his artifice: and had he not feared the diſcovery of himſelfe, he was ſo incenſed againſt him in my behalfe, that I beleeve he would have given him the lye. However he could not chuſe but give him a very ſharp anſwer. <hi>Amindor</hi> (ſaid he) you are the moſt unworthy Shepheard that ever lived and not fit for any good ſociety: Can you find a heart to ſpeake thus of <hi>Diana,</hi> unto whom you have profeſſed ſo much amitie? and unto whom you are ſo much obliged? What can we hope for from you, ſince you will not ſpare her who tranſcends us infinitly in merit and perfection? As for me, I think you the moſt daingerous perſon that lives, and ſuch as would live in reſt, muſt fly you as from the Plague. At this word <hi>Filander</hi> left him, and came to us with a countenance ſo inflamed with anger, as <hi>Daphnis</hi> knew that he was offended at <hi>Amindor:</hi> who was ſo aſtoniſhed at the ſeperation that he knew not what to do. At night <hi>Daphnis</hi> asked <hi>Filander</hi> what their diſcourſe was; and becauſe ſhe thought
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53526:48"/>
this might much increaſe my amitie towards the diſguiſed <hi>Callirea.</hi> The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhe related it all unto me, with ſuch bitter invectives againſt <hi>Amindor,</hi> and ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly for <hi>Filander,</hi> that I muſt confeſſe, that I could never ſince forbid my ſelfe from loving him when I knew him, conceiving, that his reall good-will unto me, did oblige me to it.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Daphnis,</hi> who knew that, if I loved him as <hi>Callirea,</hi> I ſhould alſo love him as <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi> did adviſe him to diſcover himſelfe unto me, telling him, that though at the firſt I might perhaps repulſe him, and be angry; yet, in the end, all would be well: and for her part, ſhe would ſo ſolicite in his behalf, that ſhe feared not but to bring all unto a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion: Yet all her perſwaſions could not infuſe ſo much courage into him: ſo as <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> reſolved to do it her ſelfe without him, or his knowledge; for, ſhe foreſaw, that <hi>Gere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi> would ere long have his Wife home again, and then all the plot was ſpoiled.</p>
               <p>With this reſolution ſhe came one day unto me, when ſhe found me alone, and after much other-common diſcourſe, ſhe began thus: <hi>Diana,</hi> ſaid ſhe, what ſhould be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Callirea</hi>'s folly? I verily believe ſhe will run out of her wits; ſhe loves you ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream paſſionately, as, I think, ſhe will not live; All day long ſhe is in your Chamber, and all nights in the Garden; and ſo pleaſeth her ſelfe with her own melancholy fancy, that I cannot ſhake her out of her muſings. I would I could give her any conſolation, (anſwered I) but what would ſhe have me do? do I not repay affection for affection? do I not make it appear in all my actions? am I failing in any point of courteſy or duty towards her? All this is true, replied <hi>Daphnis;</hi> but, did you hear her diſcourſes to her ſelfe, I believe you would extreamly pitty her: and I beſeech you, unknown to her, let us go one night and hear her. I did promiſe her, that I was very willing, and would go with her aſſoon as ſhe would; for <hi>Philidas</hi> would ere long make a viſit unto <hi>Gereſtan,</hi> and then would be the fitteſt time.</p>
               <p>A few daies after, <hi>Philidas,</hi> according to his intentions, went to ſee <hi>Gereſtan,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Amindor</hi> with him, reſolving not to return of ſeven or eight daies: When he was gone, <hi>Filander,</hi> according to his cuſtome, went into the Garden halfe dreſſed, when he thought every one was a ſleep. <hi>Daphnis,</hi> who went to bed the firſt, as ſoon as he was gone, did come to me, and told me: I put on my clothes as faſt as I could, and followed her, untill we came into the Garden. When ſhe found where he was, ſhe beckened unto me, to come a little after her; and when we were ſo neer as to hear, we ſat our ſelves down upon the ground: Preſently after I heard him ſay, But why ſhould I put my ſelfe to all this patience? what will all theſe delayes do me good? Shall I die, before I diſcover my maladie to the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon? Then ſtaying a while, he began again with a moſt profound ſigh, Why ſhould I fear that ſhe will baniſh me her preſence, and doom me to death? for, if I ſhould die, it is a comfort to ſhorten ſuch a miſerable life, and my death would ſatisfie for the fault I have committed; if death do not fall upon me, from the incenſed brow of the fair <hi>Diana,</hi> will not the violence of my affection cauſe it? What then ſhould I do, and what ſhall I ſay unto her? Alas, I would not offend her, if I could poſſibly help it: And why ſhould I keep ſilence, ſince my death will give her moſt certain knowledge? What then, ſhall I offend her? Ah! alas, injury and amitie are never together. Rather die, there's an end: But, if I ſhould die, do I not deprive her of the moſt faithfull ſervant ever that ſhe had? Is it poſſible, I ſhould offend in adoring her? I will then tell her, and at the ſame time open my breaſt, that the ſword may more eaſily puniſh my crime, if ſhe condemn me to it. Thus then will I ſay unto her, Here, faireſt Shepheardeſſe here is <hi>Filander</hi> in the habit of <hi>Callirea,</hi> who, in lieu of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging your favour, lookes for nothing but your ſury: Revenge your ſelfe then, Oh faireſt, and puniſh him, and be confident, that if his death will pleaſe and ſatisfie you, it is moſt welcome to him.</p>
               <p>Faire Shepheardeſſe, when I heard <hi>Filander</hi> thus expreſſe himſelfe, my amazement was ſo great, that I knew not what in the world to do: I was ſo vexed, and trembled ſo extreamly, that I would have gon away, and never have looked upon this impoſtor any more: But <hi>Daphnis,</hi> to compleat her treaſon, held me by force; and, as I told you, being neer this Shepheard he turned his head at the noiſe which we made; and thinking it was only <hi>Daphnis</hi> he came unto us: But, when he ſpied me, and thought I heard him, Oh heavens, ſaid he, what torment is little enough for me? Oh <hi>Daphnis,</hi> who could ever have expected this treaſon from you? At this he ran away, as if he had been diſtracted, though <hi>Daphnis</hi> called him two or three times by the name of <hi>Callirea;</hi> but fearing to be heard by others and more fearing, that <hi>Filander</hi> might do ſome hurt unto himſelfe, ſhe left me alone,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53526:49"/>
and followed him, ſaying unto me in an angry manner at parting, Well <hi>Diana,</hi> if <hi>Filan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi> do periſh, you will reſent it as long as you live. Judge, fair Shepheardeſſes, if I was not aſtoniſhed at this accident: But ſo it was, that I could not hit the way out of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a long time; at laſt, groping on every ſide, and recollecting my ſpirits, I found my Chamber, where, lying me down upon my Bed, and trembling, I could not cloſe an eye that night. As for <hi>Daphnis,</hi> ſhe ſearched for <hi>Filander</hi> ſo long, that at laſt ſhe found him more dead than alive: and after ſhe had chid him, for not cloſing with ſo good an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; and yet aſſuring him, that I was not ſo much troubled at the accident as he was, he took a little heart to himſelfe; but yet not ſo much as to embolden him the next morning to come out of his Chamber.</p>
               <p>I, on the other ſide was extreamly offended againſt them both, and was forced to keep my bed, leſt I ſhould make my diſpleaſure ſeen unto thoſe about us, and particularly unto the Niece of <hi>Gereſtan;</hi> but, as good fortune was ſhe had no more wit then there was need of, ſo as we did eaſily hide from her this ſcurvy buſineſſe, which was almoſt impoſſible to do, eſpecially for <hi>Filander,</hi> who had her company almoſt continually. <hi>Daphnis,</hi> ſhe was not a little buſied in the matter and perplexed, for, at the firſt, I would not look upon her and her excuſes: but at the laſt, ſhe did ſo overcome me that I promiſed to forget the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury ſhe had done me, yet vowing, that <hi>Filander</hi> ſhould never look me in the face again: and I do think, he had gone away without a ſight of me, had he not feared the danger which <hi>Callirea</hi> would have incurred; for ſhe had a Husband, that was extreamly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and peeviſh, and it was this very conſideration that reſtrained him. But for all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that <hi>Daphnis</hi> could uſe, I never ſtirred out of my bed, feigning my ſelf ſick, for five or ſix daies. And had I not heard that <hi>Philidas</hi> and <hi>Amindor,</hi> with <hi>Callirea,</hi> were retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned I had no ſeen him of a long time: but my fears, that <hi>Philidas</hi> would take notice of it, and leſt th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he promiſed me, that he would obſerve my commands, and kept his promiſe; for, he durſt not ſo much as turn an eye towards me; and if he did at any time by chance give a glance upon me, it was in ſuch a ſubmiſſive manner, as did aſſure me his love was extream. Preſently after, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was, <hi>Philidas, Amindor</hi> and the diſguiſed <hi>Filander,</hi> came into my Chamber, where, the windowes being cloſe, we could the better hide the diſorders in our faces. <hi>Filander</hi> had acquainted his Siſter with all paſſages, and that was the reaſon, that the ſtay of <hi>Philidas</hi> was not ſo long as he intended; for ſhe telling him, that her Siſter was ſick, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</p>
               <p>But this diſcourſe would be very tedious, if I ſhould not omit many of our triviall quarrells. But ſo it was, that <hi>Callirea</hi> being acquainted with all paſſages, ſometimes turning them into rall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rie, and ſometimes into ſeriouſneſſe, ſhe ſo brought it about by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Daphnis,</hi> that I conſented unto <hi>Filanders</hi> ſtay, untill his Siſters hair was grown unto its length again knowing, that it would ruine both her and my ſelf, if I ſhould haſten her returne. And ſo it fell out, (as <hi>Daphnis</hi> did well enough foreſee) that during the time <hi>Callirea's</hi> hair was growing, the diſcreet carriage of <hi>Filander,</hi> and the knowledge of his great affection, began ſo to flatter me, as I did of my ſelfe excuſe his diſguiſe; ſo, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went, he obtained what he ſo much deſired, which was, that I would forgive and forget his Impoſturiſme; and promiſed him, that as long as he kept himſelfe within the compaſſe of his duty. I would accept of his good will, and cheriſh his merit as it deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. His contentment upon this did much confirm my opinion of his affection, for it was ſo great as he could not diſſemble it. Whilſt we were upon theſe termes, <hi>Philidas,</hi> whoſe love did ſtill increaſe, now reſolved to diſcover himſelfe unto the diſguiſed <hi>Filander:</hi> and in order to this one day when they were walking together under a ſhade of Trees in the Garden, ſhe ſpoke thus unto him, Well <hi>Filander,</hi> ſaid ſhe, cannot all my affection to you become ſo happy, as to obtain your affection again? <hi>Callirea</hi> anſwered her, I do not know <hi>Philidas,</hi> what affection you would have, nor how it ſhould be greater unto you than it is, unleſſe you your ſelfe do inſtruct me. Ah! ſaid ſhe were your will like mine, I ſhould quickly inſtruct you. I do wonder <hi>Philidas</hi> (ſaid <hi>Callirea)</hi> that you having had ſufficient triall of me you ſhould make any doubt. Do you not know, ſaid <hi>Philidas,</hi> that extream deſire is alwaies followed by doubting. If you will ſwear that you will never fail me in point of amitie, I will declare unto you ſomething, that perhaps will make you wonder. <hi>Callirea</hi> was a little ſurpriſed at this, not knowing what <hi>Philidas</hi> ſhould mean;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53526:49"/>
yet, being deſirous to know the concluſion, ſhe anſwered him thus, I will ſwear <hi>Philida</hi> whatſoever you would have me, nor can I any waies expreſſe my deſires of doing you ſervice. Upon this, by way of thanks, and being tranſported together, <hi>Philidas</hi> took her about the neck and kiſſed her, with that vehemency, as <hi>Callirea</hi> bluſht, and puſhing him away with her hand very angrily asked him, what ſcurvie faſhion that was? I do know, anſwered <hi>Philidas,</hi> that my action makes you wonder; but, if you will have a little pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to hear me, I aſſure my ſelfe, that you will rather pitty, than have any ill opinion of me. Then ſhe began to relate unto her all the paſſages betwixt <hi>Phormion</hi> and <hi>Celion</hi> our Fathers; the ſubtletie of her Father, to let her paſſe for a man, although ſhe was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and all that I have related already unto you, and then continued in this manner, Now, that which I do require in performance of your promiſe, is, that knowing my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream affection to you, you would take me to be your Wife, and I will marry <hi>Diana</hi> unto <hi>Amindor,</hi> whom my Father hath brought up in his houſe, purpoſely to that end: And hereupon ſhe added ſo many arguments to perſwade him, that <hi>Callirea,</hi> amazed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all expreſſion, anſwered him, That it was true indeed, he had told her moſt ſtrange things, and ſuch as ſhe could hardly believe, unleſſe ſhe had ſome other aſſurance than words. Then he, unbuttoning his doublet, did ſhew him in her breaſts, a convincing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of her being a woman. Oh heavens! ſaid ſhe, for ſhame ſhew me no more. <hi>Callirea</hi> then, that ſhe might have the more time to conſult with us, did ſeem, as if ſhe were glad of the motion; but pretended, that ſhe had Parents from whom he expected all his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, and, without whoſe advice, ſhe could not reſolve upon a buſineſſe of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; and therefore ſhe charged him, to keep the buſineſſe ſecret; for, divulging of it, would give the world an occaſion to talk: and aſſured him, that if nothing was wanting but her conſent, ſhe would give him good teſtimony of her good-will. With ſuch diſcourſe as this they ended their walk, and returned to their lodging, where all that day, <hi>Callirea</hi> durſt not come unto us, leſt <hi>Philidas</hi> ſhould think ſhe ſhould ſpeak unto us; but, at night, ſhe acquainted her Brother with all the diſcourſe and afterwards, both of them went unto <hi>Daphnis,</hi> and acquainted her. You may imagine how great the wonder of every one was; but <hi>Filander</hi> was moſt pleaſed, conceiving it conduced much unto the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his deſires. In the morning, <hi>Daphnis</hi> deſired me to go and ſee the feigned <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> and the reall one ſtayed with <hi>Philidas,</hi> to the end ſhe ſhould not ſuſpect any thing. The heavens know, how I was aſtoniſhed at this newes; I proteſt unto you, my admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſo great as I knew not whether I was awake or aſleep. <hi>Daphnis,</hi> ſhe complained againſt me, for concealing it ſo long from her: to which I anſwered, That I knew nothing of it untill this houre; and when I told her, that though we were Children together, yet, I thought all men to be like <hi>Philidas.</hi> She laughed untill her ſides did ake at my ignorance. At the laſt, leſt <hi>Belinda</hi> ſhould diſpoſe of me according to her pleaſure, or, that <hi>Philidas</hi> ſhould put me upon <hi>Amindor,</hi> and he have raſh attempts upon me, I promiſed <hi>Filander,</hi> at the ſolicitation of <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Callirea,</hi> to marry him. This was the reaſon why (after he had aſſumed his own habit, and aſſured <hi>Philidas,</hi> that he would make the motion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Parents) he returned ſo ſoon with his Siſter unto <hi>Gereſtan,</hi> who never had the leaſt ſuſpition of this diſguiſe. Since that time, I permitted <hi>Filander</hi> to write unto me; and he conveyed his Letters ſo finely unto me, that neither <hi>Philidas</hi> nor <hi>Amindor</hi> ever knew of them.</p>
               <p>Hitherto, fair Shepheardeſſes, this buſineſſe had no bitterneſſe in it. But alas, that which followed was ſo full of wofull wormwood, that I ſhall never reliſh any ſweet again as long as I live. It chanced, to my fatall misfortune, that a ſtranger travelling through this Country, did finde me aſleep, neer the Fountain of <hi>Sicomores,</hi> whither I was invited by the coolneſſe of the ſhades, and the murmuring of the ſpring, to ſit me down, and ſo fell aſleep; he no ſooner had caſt his eye upon me, but he found ſomthing that pleaſed him. Oh heavens what kinde of man, or rather, what kinde of monſter, he was! His face was as black as hell; his hair ruffine like, reſembling wool, but much longer, and more diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; his beard like griſly moſſe about his chin; his noſe crooked and long, his mouth big, and his lips hanging over his chin like unto tripes; but, nothing was ſo horrid as his ſtaring eyes in all his face there was not one bit of white to be diſcovered. This lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lover was deſigned me by deſtiny, and to take from me all thoughts of ever loving again: For, being raviſhed at the ſight of me, and tranſported with leud deſires, he could not chuſe but come neerer to kiſſe me but, being armed, and onhorſeback, the noiſe awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me, and ſo, that as he was ſlooping to ſatisfie his helliſh deſire, I opened my eyes:
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53526:50"/>
And ſeeing this Monſter ſo near me, I firſt cryed out, and afterwards did ſtrike him upon the face with all my force. He being half up and half down, and not expecting ſuch reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, was ſo ſurpriſed at the blow, as he leaned on the other ſide, ſo as I had time to riſe. When I was up, he did riſe, and being very heavily armed, and fear adding wings to my heels, he could not overtake me on foot, and therefore he leaped ſuddenly into his ſaddle, and galloped after me; and when I was almoſt quite out of breath, poor <hi>Philidas</hi> who was not far off, hearing my voice, did come running unto me, and ſaw this cruel fiend purſue me with a drawn ſword in his hand; for his anger at this blow which made him ſtagger, made him alſo forget all love. <hi>Philidas</hi> did moſt generouſly oppoſe his fury, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it appeare by this laſt act, that her Love unto me was as great as her Sex would permit. At the firſt ſhe got hold of his bridle, which ſo incenſed this Barbarian, that with enequalled inhumanity, he ran her through the body, and ſhe died immediatly, fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between his Horſes feet, who fell ſo to bound and curvet, that he threw his Rider. And becauſe <hi>Philidas</hi> upon the firſt receipt of her wound did cry out aloud, and named <hi>Filan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> he not being far off, did hear the voice, and ſeeing her in ſo ſad a condition, he was much moved but much more when he ſaw this Barbarian running after me with a naked ſword in his hand, and I, as I told you, ſo out of breath, that I could hardly ſet one foot before another. How doe you think this poor Shepheard did now behave himſelf? I doe not think ever any enraged Lioneſs robbed of her young ones, did run ſo fiercely after him that carried them away, as <hi>Filander</hi> did after this cruel Monſter; and he being heavily clogged with his Arms, the poor Shepheard ſoon overtook him, and cryed out. Stay Knight, ſtay, doe not offer any violence unto her that deſerves rather to be adored. And becauſe he ſtill ſtayed not, either becauſe his fury had ſtopped his ears, or becauſe he did not underſtand the Language, <hi>Filander</hi> took up a ſtone and threw it at him, which hit him ſuch a blow upon the head, that he fell to the ground, and which without his Armour had certainly killed him; but getting up again immediatly, he forgot his anger againſt me, and turned it ſo furiouſly upon poor <hi>Filander,</hi> as he having nothing in his hand for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence but onely a Shepheards hook, he could not avoid that fatal blow which he received upon his body: But yet, feeling his enemies ſword already entred, ſuch force and courage did his natural generoſity give him, that in lieu of recoyling, he advanced, and ſo far, as till the ſword was up to the hilt, and gave his cruel enemy ſuch a blow on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head with his Shepheards hook that he felled him to the ground, and ſeizing upon his throat with his hands and teeth he made a ſhift to kill him. But, alaſs, this victory was dearly bought for as this Fiend fell dead on one ſide, <hi>Filander</hi> fell on the other, but ſo, that the point of his ſword hitting upon a ſtone, the weight of his body made it come out of the wound. I, who alwaies was looking behind me to ſee whether this Monſter did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake me, when I ſaw him wounded ſo dangerouſly, forgetting all manner of fear, I ſtopped; and when I almoſt dead as well as he did ſee him in this lamentable ſtate, ſat down upon the ground calling him in a moſt ſad tone by his name; and uſing all my diligence to help him but hee had loſt ſo much blood, that hee could not anſwer: Yet ſee the force of a pure affection; I who had uſed never to ſee ſo much blood without a Faint had now the courage to put my handkerchief into his wound, and to tear my other linnen to ſtop the courſe of blood on the other ſide: This officious diligence did him ſome ſervice for he having his head in my lap, he opened his eyes, and began to ſpeak: and ſeeing me all in tears, he forced himſelf to ſay thus unto me; If ever I hoped for a more favourable End than this, fair Shepherdeſs. I pray the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens never to have pitty upon me: I did alwaies foreſee, that the meaneſs of my merit could never bring me to my deſired happineſs; and my fears alwaies were leſt deſpair ſhould drive me unto ſome cruel reſolution againſt my ſelf. The Gods who do know what is good for us, better then we do our ſelves, did very well know that I had not lived ſo long but for you; and therefore they would have me alſo to dye for you. Judge then what contentment it is to me, ſince I do not onely die for you, but alſo to preſerve that which is moſt dear unto you, your Chaſtity. Oh my moſt fair and deareſt Miſtris, there wants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now, but one thing, to compleat my contentment: And that my ſoul may ſing an Anthem unto you in the <hi>Elizian</hi> fields, I doe moſt humbly beg it. He uttered theſe dying words with much pain; and ſeeing him in that ſad condition, I gave him as ſatisfactory an anſwer as his heart could deſire: Deareſt friend (ſaid I) ſurely the Gods never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired you with ſuch a ſweet and pure affection, to extinguiſh it ſo ſoon: I hope yet they will lend you ſo much life, as may give me opportunities to let you ſee, that I will not yeeld
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53526:50"/>
unto you in point of amity no more than you doe unto any in point of merit. And for a teſtimony of my unfeigned affection to you, ask what you will of me, and obtain it; for there is nothing that I will deny you. At theſe words he took my hand, and drawing it nearer him, I doe kiſs this fair hand (ſaid he) with a thankful ſoul, for all the favours it hath done me. But ah, faireſt Miſtris, ſince I doe ſuffer the pangs of death for your ſake, I doe conjure you by my moſt pure affection, and by your own good promiſe, to let me carry ſo much contentment with me out of the world, as to ſay, I am your Husband, and then my ſoul, dye when it will, will be at eaſe. I do vow unto you, fair Shepherdeſſes, that theſe words did ſo pierce my heart, that I was hardly able to ſuſtain myſelf; and it was onely my deſire of pleaſing him which gave me courage; and therefore as ſoon as he had made his requeſt, I ſaid thus unto him. <hi>Filander,</hi> I do conſent unto what you doe require of me; and doe ſwear unto you before all the Gods, and particularly the deities of this place, that <hi>Diana</hi> receives you for her Husband, and with her whole heart and ſoul gives her ſelf unto you. In ſpeaking theſe words, I kiſſed him. And I, ſaid he, do give my ſelf and ſoul unto you, thinking my ſelf moſt happy in the glorious Name of Husband unto the fair <hi>Diana.</hi> Alaſs, this word <hi>Diana,</hi> was the laſt he ever breathed; for drawing me towards him to kiſs me, he expired, leaving his laſt breath upon my lips. What ſhould I now doe, fair Shepherdeſs, ſince he is dead? for I did love him with moſt perfect affection. I fell upon him, and without either pulſe or any motion was carried home. Oh heavens, how I did reſent this loſs! and have ever ſince preſerved ſo lively a memory of him in my ſoul, that me thinks I ſee him every hour before my eyes; and me-thinks I heare him every minute bid me love him ſtill: And ſo I do, fair ſoul, with an eternal love. And if thou haſt any knowledg of what is don here below, receive, deareſt friend, theſe tears which I do offer unto thee, as a teſtimony, that as long as <hi>Diana</hi> lives, ſhe wil love her dear <hi>Filander. Aſtrea,</hi> to interrupt the grieving language of <hi>Diana,</hi> ſaid thus unto her; I beſeech you, fair Shepherdeſs, who was this monſtrous piece of cruelty that was the cauſe of this dire diſaſter? Alaſs, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> I know not what they call him, but I am ſure he is the cauſe of my eternal tears. But yet, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> is it not known who he was? They ſay, replied <hi>Diana,</hi> that he came out of a certain barbarous country beyond the Straits, which (I know not whether I term it right) is called <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillars; and the cauſe of his coming, ſo unfortunately for me, was becauſe he was in love with a Lady in that Country, who commanded him to ſearch all <hi>Europe</hi> over, and to ſee if he could find any ſo fair as her ſelf; alſo, if he met with any Lover, that would defend the Beauty of his Miſtris, he was obliged to fight with him, and to ſend his head, together with his Miſtreſſes Picture over unto her, and her Name. Alaſs, I would to the Gods, that I had not run away when he followed to kil me, that my life might have ſaved poor <hi>Filander.</hi> Upon theſe words ſhe ſhed ſuch abundance of tears, that <hi>Phillis</hi> to divert her, turned the diſcourſe, and did riſe up. Me thinks (ſaid ſhe) you have ſit too long, it would be better to walk a little. Upon this, all three did riſe up, and went towards their village. <hi>Leonida,</hi> who as I told you, was within hearing, did not loſe a ſyllable of what was ſaid; and the more ſhe heard, the more deſirous ſhe was to hear. But when ſhe ſaw them gone, without any mention of <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſhe was very angry; yet in hopes to diſcover ſomthing more if ſhe ſtayed a while amongſt them, when ſhee ſaw they were gone, ſhee came out of her Buſh, and followed them, but at a diſtance; for, ſhe would not have them think, that ſhe over-heard them. <hi>Phillis</hi> by chance turning about did ſee her, and alſo knowing her, did ſhew her unto her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions who ſtayed, and ſeeing ſhe came towards them, they went back to meet her, and to do thoſe civilities her quality did merit: ſo they met and ſaluted: <hi>Leonida</hi> full of courteſie, after the firſt complements, addreſſed her ſelf unto <hi>Diana,</hi> and ſaid unto her; Wiſe <hi>Diana,</hi> I came purpoſely this morning from the houſe of <hi>Adamas</hi> my Uncle, to wait upon you and the reſt of theſe fair Shepheardeſſes, and to ſee whether the reports of your virtue <hi>Diana,</hi> of your beauty <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and your merit <hi>Phillis,</hi> be anſwerable unto what Fame hath trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petted in your commendations. <hi>Diana</hi> ſeeing her Companions referred it unto her, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned this anſwer. Great Nimph, perhaps it had been much better for us, that fame had been more ſilent, and not raiſed your expectation to too great a height; however, ſince you are pleaſed to do us this honour, we do receive it as is our duty, in all humble grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: At theſe words, they conducted her into <hi>Diana</hi>'s village, where ſhe was entertained with ſuch welcome, and ſo much civility as ſhe wondred how it was poſſible to find people ſo accompliſhed in Woods and Paſtures.</p>
               <p>The Afternoon was ſpent in ſeveral queſtions which <hi>Leonida</hi> asked of them and amongſt
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53526:51"/>
the reſt ſhe enquired what was become of a Shepheard called <hi>Celadon,</hi> that was the ſon of <hi>Alcippes? Diana</hi> anſwered that not long ſince he was unfortunately drown'd in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Lignon.</hi> And his brother <hi>Lycidas,</hi> ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> is he yet married? No, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> nor doe I think he is in any haſte; for the loſs of his brother is yet too freſh in his memory. But I pray, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> by what miſchance was he loſt? by endeavouring to help this Shepheardeſs (ſaid <hi>Diana)</hi> who fell into the River firſt: And then ſhe pointed unto <hi>Aſtrea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Nimph, though not ſeeming, yet taking notice of <hi>Aſtrea</hi>'s actions, did ſee that her complexion changed and to hide her bluſhes ſhe covered her face with her hand and therefore concluded that ſhe did love him really: And to make a further diſcovery ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued her queſtions. And was his body never found, ſaid ſhe? No, ſaid <hi>Diana</hi> onely his hat was found, and as it was ſwiming down the River was ſtayed by ſome buſhes. <hi>Phillis</hi> knowing if this talk continued it would draw tears from the eyes of her companion, ſhee interrupted. I beſeech you, great Nimph, ſaid ſhe, what good fortune for us was it, that brought you unto this place? I told you at the firſt (ſaid ſhe) it was to be acquainted with you, and to enjoy the happineſs of your good company. Since it is ſo, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> it would not be amiſs, ſo it ſuit with your pleaſure, to goe out with us unto our accuſtomed exerciſes, ſo will you beſt be acquainted with our way of living, and alſo that you give us leave to uſe the freedom of our villages before you. With all my heart, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> for I know that conſtraint is never agreeable and Ile aſſure you, that I did not bring with me any intentions of diſpleaſing you. Thus <hi>Leonida</hi> taking <hi>Diana</hi> by one hand, and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> by the other they walked out, untill they came unto that wood which extends it ſelf as far as the banks of <hi>Lignon.</hi> They were no ſooner ſet down, but they heard one ſing not far off, and <hi>Diana</hi> who knew the voice turned towards <hi>Leonida,</hi> and ſaid, Great Nimph, will you pleaſe to heir the diſcourſe of a young Shepheard, who has nothing of Rural about him but his Name and Habit? For being educated in great Cities, and amongſt perſons of civility he ſmels not at all of the Country. Who is it (ſaid <hi>Leonidas)</hi> It is the Shepheard <hi>Silvander</hi> (anſwered <hi>Diana)</hi> who hath not been amongſt us much above a year. I beſeech you ſaid the Nimph, of what Family is he? It is a queſtion very hard to be reſolved, anſwered <hi>Diana:</hi> for he himſelf knows not who were his Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, onely has ſome far fetcht conception, that they were of <hi>Forreſts,</hi> and therefore he came hither with a reſolution to ſtay. And truly our <hi>Lignon</hi> would have a great loſs ſhould he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d part; for I do not think a more compleat Shepheard ever came into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Your commendations of him, ſaid the Nimph, is invitation ſufficient to goe and ſee him, and therefore let us go to him. If he do ſee us, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> and thinks he ſhall not be troubleſome unto you, he will be ſure to wait upon you preſently: And as ſhe was ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, he came. For, as fortune was, the Shepheard as he walked eſpied them, and came to them; but becauſe he did not know <hi>Leonida</hi> he ſeemed as if he would have paſſed by, when <hi>Diana</hi> ſaid unto him; What <hi>Silvander,</hi> is it the civility of Cities to interrupt good company by paſſing by them, and ſaying nothing? The Shepheard ſmiled and anſwered; Since I have ſinned in interrupting you, the leſs will I ſtay in my ſin. That's not it, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> which makes you ſo ſoon gone, but rather becauſe you think there is not merit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough amongſt us to ſtay you; yet if you doe but caſt your eye upon this Nimph, I am confident that if your eyes have any judgement you will finde more merit than any where elſe That which draws another thing unto it ſelf (replied <hi>Silvander)</hi> muſt have ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive ſympathy with that which it doth draw; but ſince there is no ſuch ſympathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt your high merits Great Nimph, and my poor imperfections, you need not wonder if your perfections did not attract me unto you.</p>
               <p>Your modeſty, Sir (ſaid <hi>Lemida)</hi> does onely make the diſſimilitude betwixt us: Doe you think it is in your body, or your ſoul? If in your body, your face and the reſt of your parts argues the contrary: if in the ſoul, me thinks, if you have one that is reaſonable, it is not different from ours <hi>Silvander</hi> found that now he had not to deal with Shephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes, but with one of a higher ſtrain and therefore he reſolved to anſwer her with more ſolid reaſons than he uſed amongſt Shepheardeſſes, therefore thus replied: Every thing in the whole univerſe, fair Nimph, muſt be valued according to its own proper quality; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, Man who is of higheſt eſteem, would be the loweſt, ſince every animal excels him in ſome particular thing or other; one in ſtrength, another in ſwiftneſs, another in ſight, another in hearing, another in ſmelling: and ſo in many priviledges of body. But when it is conſidered, that the gods have made all theſe Animals for the ſervice of Man,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53526:51"/>
and man for the ſervice of the gods, it muſt needs be confeſſed that the gods are above all; from hence I argue, that to know the true value of every thing, it muſt be looked into, to what ſervice the gods did make them, and it is they that ſet the value upon things: nor ſurely the gods could never be ſo much miſtaken, as to equall your merit and mine, and yet make you a great Nymph, and me but a poor ſilly ſhepheard. <hi>Leonida</hi> did in her mind much commend the wit of this Shepheard, who could put ſo good a gloſſe upon a bad matter. And therefore to give him more ſubject to continue, ſhe ſaid thus unto him. But allow all this in regard of me, yet why could not theſe ſhepheardeſſes invite you, ſince ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your own argument, there is the ſame proportion and ſimpathy betwixt you and them? Sage Nymph, anſwered <hi>Silvander,</hi> the leſſe does alwayes ſubmit unto the greater part and where you are, theſe ſherheardeſſes muſt do the ſame why diſdainful Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard (ſaid <hi>Diana)</hi> do you ſo little eſteem of us? I did ſay ſo, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> becauſe I did eſteeme you ſo much: for if I had an ill opinion of you, I ſhould never have ſaid that you were a part of that great Nymph, ſince thereby I do not make you her inferiour. Only in that ſhe deſerves to be loved, for her merits, for her beauty, and for her quality &amp; you only for your merits and for your beautie. I ſhould be glad <hi>Silvander</hi> (ſaid <hi>Diana)</hi> that I had ſo much merit or beauty either, as to obtain the Love of ſo wel an accompliſhed Shepheard as you are. She ſpoke this, becauſe he was ſo far from any thoughts of Love that he was called amongſt them The inſenſible man: and ſhe was very deſirous to make him ſpeake of it. Unto whom he anſwered, think and beleeve what you pleaſe, ſo you will confeſſe you want one of your principall parts. And, which is that? (ſaid <hi>Diana):</hi> Your wil, replyed he, for it and the effects of it are contrary. No no (ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi> and interrupted him) for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve <hi>Silvander</hi> loves her as much as her will would have him. The Shepheard hearing her ſay ſo, turned towards <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and ſaid that they did him wrong to be two to one. The wrong, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> is offered unto me, for this ſhepheardeſſe ſeeing me in combate with a ſtrong enemy; and ſuſpecting my courage and ſtrength, would needs aid me.</p>
               <p>That is not it which does offend you, fair Shepheardeſſe ſaid he, for ſhe has more judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then to make any doubt of your victory; but that which does offend you is, that ſhe ſeeing me already vanquiſhed, ſhe muſt needs ſteal the victorie, and the honour of it in offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to give me a blow at the latter end of the combate: but I do not know how ſhe did intend it; for I aſſure you, if you had not medled, ſhe had not ſo eaſily gotten the glory as ſhe thought. <hi>Phillis</hi> who had a good natural and pleaſant wit, &amp; who reſolved to ſpend that day with <hi>Leonida,</hi> as pleaſantly as ſhe could, did anſwer him in a haughty manner, Tis very well <hi>Silvander</hi> (ſaid ſhe) that you thinke it a thing ſo deſirable and honorable to me, to vanquiſh you; but let me tell you, I rank the victory amongſt the meaneſt, that ever I got. Neither ought you to deſpiſe it (ſaid the Shepheard) ſince it is the firſt you ever got of me. As it is honorable, replyed <hi>Phillis,</hi> to be the firſt, where there is merit; ſo it is a ſhame, where there is none Ah Shepheardeſſe, (ſaid <hi>Diana)</hi> never ſay ſo of <hi>Silvander:</hi> for if all Shepheards who are inferior to him in merit, ſhould be ſcorned, I know not who ſhould be loved. This, this is the very blow that will overcome him, (ſaid <hi>Phillis)</hi> nay doubtleſſe he is yours: Uncivilized and wild ſpirits are to ſurpriſed at the very firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts: for not being accuſtomed to ſuch favours, they recieve them with ſuch a guſt, as they are not able to make any reſiſtance. <hi>Phillis</hi> ſpoke thus in way of mockery; but the gratious defence of <hi>Diana</hi> had ſuch an influence upon this Shepheard, that he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe obliged by the Lawes of courteſie to ſerve her and in that opinion, the perfections of <hi>Diana</hi> had ſo much power over him, that he conceived ſuch ſeeds of love, as time and pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice did increaſe to a great heights; as afterwards I ſhall tell you. This diſpute paſſed amongſt theſe Shepheardeſſes with much delight unto <hi>Leonida</hi> who admired their quaint wits. then <hi>Phillis</hi> turning towards the Shepheard, ſaid unto him: Come, come Shepheard, words are but wind; come to the teſt, and tell me truly, Who is the Shepheardeſſe which particularly is your adored Saint? Even ſhe, anſwered he, whom you ſee me adore. That is as much to ſay, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> that you adore none but that proceeds, alas from want of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. Rather, replyed <hi>Sylvander,</hi> from want of wil. But you, fair one, who doe ſo much deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe me, I pray tell me, Who is the Shepheard whom you do particularly Love? All ſuch, anſwered ſhe, as have any wit or courage: And he that ſees a perfect beautie, and cannot love; certainly wants wit or courage or both.</p>
               <p>This is an anſwer too generall ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> pray come to particulars, and tell us that one whom you do love? I wiſh, ſaid ſhe, there were any ſo forward as to attempt it. Then, added <hi>Silvander,</hi> it is for want of courage. Then <hi>Silvander,</hi> ſaid she it is for want of

will. Why ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> would you have any to think that it is more want of will in you then me I would thoſe actions which are decent in you, (ſaid the ſhepheardeſſe) were permitted me, do you think it handſome in me to leap and run as you do? But let us diſpute no longer let <hi>Diana</hi> be Judge in the buſineſſe and thereby you may ſee what confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I have in my cauſe, ſince I make choice of a partiall Judge. I ſhall judge according to reaſon (ſaid <hi>Diana).</hi> Then ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſince words cannot juſtifie a buſineſſe, is it not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to come to proofes? Doubtleſſe it is (ſaid <hi>Diana).</hi> Condemne then this ſhepheard, replyed <hi>Phillis,</hi> to render ſome proofs of that merit which he ſaith is in him; and that he undertake to ſerve and love a ſhepheardeſſe, in ſuch a manner as ſhe be conſtrained to confeſſe that he merits to be loved againe; and if he cannot do that, then, that he inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly acknowledge his unworthyneſſe. <hi>Leonida</hi> and the ſhepheardeſſes thought this propoſition ſo agreeable to reaſon that with one common voice he was condemned: Not, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> that he ſhould be conſtrained to love, for that muſt ever proceed from a free vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary genius and not from conſtraint, but I do ordain that he do ſerve and honour, as you do ſay. My Judg anſwered <hi>Silvander,</hi> though you have condemned me without hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me, yet I will not appeal from your ſentence; only I require that ſhe whom I muſt ſerve, do merit and ackowledge my ſervice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Silvander, Silvander,</hi> ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi> becauſe you want courage, you fly unto evaſions: but I ſhall prevent you by a propoſition which I ſhall make. I do propound unto you one, againſt whom there is no exceptions, either in matter of wit, courage, or beauty, and that is <hi>Diana.</hi> For my part, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> I do accept of the motion, provided it be with the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all theſe beauties. <hi>Diana</hi> would liave anſwered, and made ſome excuſe but at the requeſt of <hi>Leonida</hi> and <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> ſhe conſented upon condition that this eſſay ſhould not laſt above three monthes.</p>
               <p>This courtſhip being <hi>Silvanders</hi> ſentence, he kneeled down and kiſſed the hand of his new Miſtriſſe, as if he had taken his oath of fidelitie, and afterwards riſing up, he ſaid thus; Faireſt Miſtriſſ; I do in all humility ſubmit unto your ordinance, but I do moſt humbly beſeech you to let me make one propoſition. And when <hi>Diana</hi> ſaid that he had free liberty, he went on. As I have been juſtly condemned to make this proof of my ſelfe for ſpeaking too highly of my own merits, againſt a perſon who deſpiſed me: So, I beſeech you why ſhould this vain glorious <hi>Phillis</hi> who infinitly outſwells me in vanitie, and who was the firſt cauſe of this diſpute, why I ſay ſhould not ſhe be ſentenced to render the like teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? <hi>Aſtrea</hi> not ſtaying for <hi>Dianas</hi> anſwer, ſaid, that ſhe thought the motion ſo juſt as ſhe was conſident it would be granted, and <hi>Diana</hi> asking the Nymphs opinion, who was of the ſame mind, ſhe condemned the ſhepheardeſſe as was requeſted. I did never expect a more favorable doome ſaid <hi>Phillis;</hi> but well, what muſt I do? You muſt get the favour of ſome ſhepheardeſſe, (ſaid <hi>Silvander.)</hi> That, ſaid <hi>Diana</hi> is not reaſonable, She muſt do more then that: For I do ordaine that ſhe do love and ſerve a ſhepheardeſſe; and ſo as ſhe do cauſe her ſelfe to be loved, and, he or ſhe of you two, who ſhall be leaſt unto her you ſerve, shall be conſtrayned to yeild unto the other. Then my deſire is, ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi> that I may ſerve <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> Siſter, ſaid she, you are about a work which is already done to your hand: but it were much better you made choice of <hi>Diana,</hi> not only for the two reaſons which you alledged unto <hi>Silvander,</hi> which was, her merits and wit, but alſo becauſe she is beſt able to judge of both your ſervices, if they be both addreſſed unto her; This did car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuch a ſound of reaſon with it, that it was immediately conſented unto: then after <hi>Diana</hi> had taken an oath, that without any regard but truth, the should do equall juſtice at the three months end, It was very pleaſant to obſerve the paſſages of this new love. For <hi>Phillis</hi> was a very excellent ſervant, and <hi>Silvander</hi> feigning to be one, became one in good earneſt, as afterwards you shall heare. <hi>Diana</hi> on the other ſide did ſo well know how to play the Miſtriſſe that any would have thought it to be in reall earneſt. As they were thus diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and <hi>Leonida</hi> thinking this kind of life to enjoy more happineſſe then any other, they ſaw two Shepheardeſſes and two Shepheards, comming along the meadow, who by their habits ſeemed to be ſtrangers; and when they were a little neerer, <hi>Leonida</hi> who was very inquiſitive to know the names of the Shepheards and Shepheardeſſes of <hi>Lignon,</hi> did aske who they were? To which <hi>Phillis</hi> anſwered that they were ſtrangers, to which <hi>Silvander</hi> ſaid, that ſurely he ſhould know one of them particulary, whoſe name is <hi>Hylas,</hi> a merry ſhepheard, and one that loves all he lookes upon; but the beſt is, he who receives the blow has the plaiſter; for as he can ſoon love, ſo he can ſoon forget; and he has the maddeſt and moſt extravagant arguments, to prove his inconſtant humour to be the beſt, as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible

to heare them and not laugh: truly ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> his company will be very good, &amp; let us put him upon that diſcourſe as ſoon as he comes. That's eaſily don, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> for he will alwaies be talking of it: but as this is his humour, ſo there is one with him of a quite contrary diſpoſition, for he does nothing but pule and grieve for the death of a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe whom he loved; he is a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This Prologue, generous Shepheard, muſt plead for an excuſe, ſince I am forced to tell you that I do love <hi>Tircis:</hi> I ſucked in this affection almoſt with my milk, and my ſoul being ever ſince nouriſhed with this food, did receive, as its own, the accidents of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Neighbours we alwaies were the amity of our Parents, the equalitie of our ages, and the ſweet diſpoſition in <hi>Tircis</hi> his younger years, were ſo many ſweet allurements, to make me his.

               <p>Aſſoon as ever <hi>Tircis</hi> found out the good-will of his happy <hi>Cleon,</hi> he received it with ſo much contentment, as his heart was not able to contain his joyes, but his eyes alſo did ſhare in the happineſſe, and were ſo much altered from what they were, as they could not chuſe but ſend forth ſignes of their too much joy. <hi>Cleon's</hi> diſcretion was ſuch, that ſhe conferred no more favours upon <hi>Tircis,</hi> in the eye of the world, than ordinary; but, being jealous of her honour, ſhe deſired him to counterfeit a love unto me, to the end all eyes might be upon me, and off her; and me ſooner than any other, it being long obſerved that I loved him. He, who was all obedience unto whatſoever <hi>Cleon</hi> commanded, did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly apply himſelf unto me: Oh heavens! when I think upon the ſweeteſt expreſſions he uſed unto me, I cannot chuſe, though they were all falſe, but cheriſh them, and wiſh, ſince I can be no otherwiſe happy, that I were ſo deceived again. And certainly, <hi>Tircis</hi> had no hard task to perſwade me, that he loved me: For, I did not think my ſelfe ſo diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but that a long continued practice, together with my endeavours to pleaſe him, might work upon him; at which, the vain-glorious <hi>Cleon,</hi> did oft make her ſelfe ſport with <hi>Tircis:</hi> but, had Love been juſt, and turned the love of <hi>Tircis</hi> to me into earneſt, her mockery might have lightt upon her ſelfe. This life of diſſimulation was ſo tedious to him, that he was not able to endure it any longer; and had not Love blinded the eyes of all Lovers, certainly I ſhould have perceived it, as well as moſt did who ſaw us together; but I would not lend any believing ear unto them, no more, than unto my moſt mortall enemy. And becauſe <hi>Cleon</hi> and I were very familiar, this ſubtle Shepheardeſſe was afraid, leſt time ſhould diſcover my error unto me, which to prevent, ſhe invented this ſtratagem: Her deſigne was, as I told you before, to conceal that affection which <hi>Tircis</hi> bore unto her, under his cloak of ſeeming to love me; and it was effected accordingly, for every one talked aloud of the love of <hi>Tircis</hi> unto me: But <hi>Cleon</hi> as I told you before, fearing this ſtratagem would be diſcovered, did invent another full as ſubtle as the other: She adviſed <hi>Tircis</hi> to make me believe, that the world talked very broad of our amitie, and put wrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions upon it; and therefore it was neceſſary, to ſtop all ſcandalous tongues by pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: and in order to that, he would counterfeit a love unto <hi>Cleon,</hi> and tell her (ſaid ſhe) that you make choice of me rather than any other, becauſe of your conveniency, in being neer me, and ſpeaking to me. I, who was all ſinceritie, and no ſubtletie, did think this counſel to be very good, ſo as from thence forwards, with my permiſſion, when we were all three together, he talked with <hi>Cleon</hi> as he was wont, without any difficultie: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, it was good ſport to them, and would have been to any other, that had known the diſſimulation: For, when I ſaw him ſo officious about <hi>Cleon,</hi> I thought he had all that while but mocked her, and had much adoe to forbear laughing: On the other ſide, <hi>Cleon</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:53526:54"/>
obſerving my actions, and knowing how I was deluded; ſhe could hardly contain her thoughts of mirth. But ſee how good natur'd I was, I did extreamly pitty her, for the griefe ſhe would reſent, when ſhe came to know the truth: But alas, afterwards I found, that the pitty belonged unto my ſelfe; and who, as well as I, might not as well have been deceived? for Love, aſſoon as ever he takes entire poſſeſſion of a ſoul, does preſently expell all diffidence of the party loved. And this diſſembling Shepheard did perſonate his part ſo well, that had I been in <hi>Cleons</hi> room, perhaps I ſhould have doubted, whether he acted a fiction or a truth: Sometimes, when he was betwixt us both, and had given <hi>Cleon</hi> ſome notable demonſtration of affection, preſently he would turn to me, and ask me in my ear, whether he did not act his part well: but, his grand craft reſted not in ſuch a trifle; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you hear what an Arts-Maſter he was in his Art, he talked with <hi>Cleon</hi> in private more often then with me, he would kiſſe her hand, be down upon his knees two houres together before her, and never hid any paſſage from me, for the reaſons aforeſaid: But in publick, he never ſtirred from me and courted me with ſo much diſſimulation, that moſt had the ſame opinion of our Loves: which he did upon deſigne, deſiring, that I only ſhould ſee his courtſhip unto <hi>Cleon,</hi> becauſe he knew I did not believe it; but, would not by any means, that any others ſhould be witneſſes. And when I told him, that we could not remove that opinion which the people had of our amitie and that none would believe he loved <hi>Cleon;</hi> then would he anſwer me, Why, how ſhould they ever believe a thing which is not, no, nor well enough diſſembled? But, ſaid, he, whatſoever we do, we muſt deceive <hi>Cleon,</hi> let others think what they will; for, if ſhe be but handſomely deluded, our deſigne is almoſt compleated: Hereupon he deſired me, that I would ſpeak unto her in his behalfe, and become as it were, his confident: She, ſaid he, who has that opinion alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, will the more gladly receive the meſſages, that you ſhall bring, and ſo we ſhall live in more aſſurance, and freer from all ſuſpition. Oh! what a miſerable fortune do we often follow? For my part, I thought, that if <hi>Cleon</hi> did believe I had loved this Shepheard, I ſhould deſtroy that beliefe, by deſiring her to love him, and by ſpeaking for him as his confident. But <hi>Cleon,</hi> knowing the diſcourſe between the Shepheard and me, and living in a kinde of conſtraint, ſhe thought that by this means, ſhe might moſt conveniently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all her Meſſages and Letters from him; and therefore ſhe bade the propoſition which I made unto her very welcome, and after this treated me as one ſhe loved: And thus I was made uſe of, only as a Letter Carryer between them. Oh Love! what a miſery didſt thou put me upon? But, I am not the firſt who has done the like offices for another in thinking to do it for themſelves. At that time, the <hi>Franks,</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Goths,</hi> and the <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> being all up in Armes, we were conſtrained to live in Townes; and there being a huge concourſe of people from all parts, alſo wanting their Country-accommodations, a peſtilent diſeaſe did ſo raign in the Town, as moſt of the people died of it: ſo it chanced, that <hi>Cleons</hi> Mother was infected; and though the diſeaſe was ſo contagious, that hardly either Parent or kindred, would ſtay with the party infected; yet, ſuch was the naturall affection of <hi>Cleon</hi> to her Mother, that ſhe would never part from her, but would ſtill ſtay, notwithſtanding all the perſwaſion of friends, who told her, that ſhe offended the gods, in running into a wilfull danger; unto whom ſhe ſtill returned this anſwer, If you love me never uſe any more of this diſcourſe; for, do I not owe my life unto her, who gave me mine? and will the gods be offended with me for helping her, who taught me to ſerve them? In this pious and filiall reſolution, ſhe would not forſake her Mother, but ſhut her ſelfe up with her, and was as buſy in helping her, as if the diſeaſe had not been at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious. <hi>Tircis</hi> ſtood all the day at the dore, and wooed to come in; but <hi>Cleon</hi> would up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no termes permit him, leſt if ſhe had, it might have been ſcandalous unto her: But ſtill he waited at the dore and cauſed all manner of neceſſaries to be brought unto them: yet, ſo the heavens would have it, that <hi>Cleon,</hi> notwithſtanding all antidotes and preſervatives which <hi>Tircis</hi> brought unto her, was infected. When the Shepheard heard that, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to keep him from entring into the houſe; ſince now it was not a time to think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diſſimulations, or to fear any teeth of detractors; but he ſet all things in order, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of his eſtate, and declared his Will; afterwards, putting it in the charge of a friend to help him, he entred, and ſhut himſelfe up with the Mother and the Daughter, reſolving to run the ſame fortune with <hi>Cleon.</hi> It is not materiall to relate unto you, what good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he did them, and how officious and ſervicable he was unto the Mother, for the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſake: But at laſt the Mother dyed, and when none was left in the houſe but he and his Miſtreſſe, whoſe maladie ſtill increaſed, I do not think the poor Shepheard got one minute
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53526:54"/>
of reſt; he held her continually in his armes, and dreſſed her. She, on the other ſide, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies loving him did take this laſt action for ſuch an evident teſtimony of his love, that hers augmented much more; and her greateſt griefe was the danger he was in for her ſake. He, on the other ſide, had ſo much ſatisfaction, as to rejoyce as much as a ſad occaſion would permit, that he had the means to teſtifie his good will. ſo it hapned that this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſs being in a condition to be cut, a Phyſician could not be procured, that would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to touch her, for fear of danger: <hi>Tircis,</hi> whoſe affection prompted him unto any thing, being taught how to do it, he took the Lancer, and lifting up her Arm, he did cut it, and dreſſed it when he had done. To be brief, all things of moſt danger and difficulty, were eaſie and ſweet unto him, in hopes of doing her ſome good. But her malady ſtill encreaſed, and brought his beloved <hi>Cleon</hi> into ſuch a ſad condition, that ſhe had no more ſtrength left than to utter theſe words; I am very forry <hi>Tircis</hi> that the gods are not pleaſed to draw the thread of my lamentable life a little longer, onely to teſtifie my extreme gratitude: but though I ſhould live as many yeares, as I have already done dayes, I ſhould never bee able to ſatisfie you for the abundance of your affection to me. Theſe words were uttered with much pain; but her affection to this Shepheard gave her power to utter them. Unto which <hi>Tircis</hi> anſwered, My deareſt Miſtris, all I have done, and all I can ever do; is all far ſhort of my will to do any real ſervice; beleeve me, deareſt <hi>Cleon,</hi> my obligations to you are greater than a thouſand lives can pay. The heavens which gave me a being only to be yours, would accuſe me of miſpending my time, ſhould I employ one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of my life otherwiſe then in your ſervice. He would have continued longer but the Shepheardeſs finding her ſelf extreamly ill did interrupt him: Ceaſe my dear friend and leave talking to me, that I may imploy that little time I have to live, in aſſuring you that I can love you as much as ever my ſoul is capable of: So ſeeing my time is very near, I bid thee eternal adieu, and deſire three things of you; To love thy <hi>Cleon</hi> for ever; to enterre my corps near my Mothers, and when you do pay the debt which is due unto humanity, let your corps be layd near mine, that though our bodies could not be united alive, yet they may in death. To which he anſwered; The Gods would be unjuſt, if after they have begun ſo perfect an amity as ours, they ſhould ſo ſoon deſtrov it: But I hope they will preſerve you, at leaſt take me away before you: But if they will not, I will onely beg as much life as to fulfill thoſe commands you have laid upon me, and then to let me fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you. Be aſſured, deareſt ſoul, that unleſſe they alwaies tye up my hands, I will not be long after you. Friend, anſwered ſhe, I command you to live as long as the Gods have ordained, that ſo whilſt I am chanting our perfect amity in the <hi>Elizian</hi> Fields, you may publiſh it unto the living: And ſo both the dead, and they living will honour ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> memory. But, friend, I perceive my malady is forcing me to leave you: Adieu, adieu, the moſt perfect Lover left amongſt the living. At theſe words ſhe dyed, leaning her head in the boſom of her Shepheard. To repeat his ſorrows, would but open his wounds, and make them bleed afreſh. Oh moſt fatal death (cryed out <hi>Tircis)</hi> that hath robbed me of the better part of myſelf, either reſtore that life which thou haſt taken from me, or elſe take the reſt. Then, to give way unto thoſe tears and ſighs which this remembrance did revive in his heart, he ſtood ſilent untill <hi>Silvander</hi> told him, that to grieve for what there was no remedy, was but a teſtimony of weakneſs. Oh, ſaid <hi>Tircis,</hi> I doe grieve becauſe there is no remedy; for if there were, I should not grieve. <hi>Laonice</hi> then continued on: This happy Shepheardeſs being dead, and <hi>Tircis</hi> having performed the laſt office of amity, he procured her to be interred next her Mother; but the careleſneſs of thoſe who had it in charge was ſuch, as they layd her corps in another place. As for him, his ſorrows were ſuch, as he never ſtirred off his bed, as if he lived only to obey her commandements. Some few dayes after, enquiring of thoſe who came to ſee him, where they had laid his beloved corps, he underſtood that ſhe was not enterred by her Mother; at which he was infinitely diſpleaſed; and for a great ſum of mony hired ſome to take it up again, and lay it by her Mother, which accordingly was done: They went unto the place, uncovered the earth, and four of them took up the corps, but having carryed it a little way, the Infection was ſo violent that they were forced to leave it by the way, and could carry it no further: whereof <hi>Tircis</hi> being advertiſed, after he had made great offers unto them to go on, and ſeeing they would by no means undertake it; What <hi>Tircis</hi> (ſaid he) didſt thou think the love of gain could work more with them than thy affection with thee? Fie, ſie, <hi>Tircis,</hi> this is too great an affront offered unto thy amity. So, as if he were tranſported, he ran to the place where the corps lay; and though it had layn in the earth three dayes, and ſmelt extreamly, he took it up in his arms, and carried it unto the Tomb of her Mother, which was already
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53526:55"/>
covered. Then after this high teſtimony of affection, he returned to the Town, and would not be ſeen of any. When all theſe paſſages were known unto me, but yet onely hearing <hi>Cleon</hi> was dead, I went unto his chamber, to enquire of all particulars: When I came at the chamber door, which ſtood half ſhut, and half open, me-thought I heard him ſigh; and was not miſtaken, for looking in at a chink of the door, I ſaw him lying upon his bed with eyes and hands lifted up to heaven, and his face ſwimming all in tears. Judge ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Shepheard, whether or no I was aſtoniſhed; for I did not think he had loved her, but came rather with intentions to rejoice with him, than to condole. Then, after I had ſeen him in this ſad condition, I heard him utter theſe words:</p>

               <p>Oh heavens! what a weeping ſtatue was I turned, when I heard him utter theſe words! My aſtoniſhment was ſo great, as leaning againſt the door, it opened; at which he turning his head, and ſeeing me, he put out his hand, and bade me ſit down upon the bed by him; and when he had wiped away ſome tears from his ſwelled eyes, he ſpoke thus unto me: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs, <hi>Laonice,</hi> poor <hi>Cleon</hi> is dead, and we are left here below to lament her loſs. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my grief would not ſuffer me to return an anſwer, he continued on. I know Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſs, that you ſeeing me in this condition, doe much wonder, that the feigned amity, which I profeſſed unto her, ſhould make me mourn ſo exceſſively for her loſs. But, alaſs, remove your error, I beſeech you; for I think it is too great a ſin againſt Love to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue any longer under the cover of diſſimulation, which my affection forced me to aſſume. And know <hi>Laonice,</hi> that all this while, I did love <hi>Cleon,</hi> and all my addreſſes unto you were but coverings of that love. And therefore if you did ever love me, for Gods ſake <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> turn that love into pitty, and condole with me this ſad diſaſter, which at one blow has cut off all my hopes. If ever I did offend you, I beſeech you, pardon me, ſince it was committed onely becauſe I could not fail in my duty to my deareſt <hi>Cleon.</hi> I was ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported at theſe words, that I went out, and could hardly hit the way to my own home, where I kept my chamber a long time, lamenting this ſad diſaſter: And I did with <hi>Tircis,</hi> whom I ſtill loved, excuſe all thoſe Treaſons he had committed againſt me and pardoned the diſſimulations whereby he offended me thinking them no diſſimulations nor treaſons, but onely violencies of love. I was the more eaſily induced to pardon him, ſince Love, as a Conſederate with his faults, did flatter me with ſome hopes of ſucceeding <hi>Cleon</hi> in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. As I was thus ſoothing my ſelf in theſe thoughts one came to tell me, that <hi>Tircis</hi> was gone, and none knew whither, or where he was. This ſurcharge of ſorrow, ſo ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me as I did immediatly reſolve to follow him. And to the end none might hinder me, I departed, ſo ſecretly at the beginning of the night, as before morning I was gotten farre off. Whether I was aſtoniſhed when I was alone in the dark, the heavens do know, unto whom my complaints were addreſſed; but however, Love, who was my ſecret compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did inſpire me with courage enough to go through with my deſign: Following then on my voyage, and taking the path my feet firſt trod upon; for I know not which way <hi>Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> went, nor my ſelf neither; I went wandering like a Vagabond for three months toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53526:55"/>
and never heard the leaſt ſyllable of him. At the laſt, paſſing over the Mount <hi>Dor,</hi> I met with this Shepheardeſs (ſaid ſhe, and pointed unto <hi>Madonche)</hi> and with her this Shepheard called <hi>Therſander,</hi> ſitting under a ſhady Rock to paſs away the heat of the day; And it being my cuſtom to enquire of all I met concerning <hi>Tircis,</hi> I underſtood by ſome ſigns which they gave me, that he was in thoſe deſarts, and went wandring and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the loſs of <hi>Cleon.</hi> Then I related unto them, all the ſame ſtory which I have told unto you, and conjured them to give me the beſt directions they could. <hi>Madonche</hi> moved with pitty, did give me ſuch a ſweet anſwer, as I judged her to be ſick of the ſame diſeaſe I was, and I was not miſtaken; for I heard, ſince, the ſtory of her ſorrows, by which I found, that Love wounds as well in the Court as Country. And becauſe there was much reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance in our fortunes, ſhe deſired we might both goe together, ſince both were upon the ſame queſt. I did with open arms embrace the motion, and thought it better to enjoy ſuch a ſad companion, than to be alone. But this diſcourſe is impertinent, ſince I intend onely to relate the ſtory of <hi>Tircis,</hi> and my ſelf. Well, generous Shepheard, after three months queſt in this Country, I met with him; and ſo contrary to his expectation, that hee was extreamly ſurpriſed. At the firſt, he looked upon me with a loving eye; but afterwards, when he ſaw the occaſion of my voyage was my Love to him, hee openly declared the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which he ſtill bore unto <hi>Cleon,</hi> and that it was not in his power to love me. Love, I beſeech thee (and not this ungrateful man) If there be any juſtice in thee, let me have ſome recompence for all my pains.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Laonice</hi> ended, and addreſſed her ſelf in a ſad poſture unto <hi>Silvander,</hi> as if ſhe courted his favour for Juſtice in her cauſe. Then <hi>Tircis</hi> began to ſpeak in this manner; Though the ſtory of my misfortunes be, as this Shepheardeſs hath related them, yet my ſorrows are infinitely more pittifull, which I will not relate, leſt I ſhould too much trouble you, and all this company; onely with this, that when we could not ſupport our ſorrows, we did with common conſent addreſs ourſelves unto the Oracle to know our dooms from it; and we received this anſwer from the mouth of <hi>Arontine.</hi>

And to the end all things might be done according to the will of the Gods, the old Matron who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Oracle told us, that both of us were to chuſe our Advocate amongſt the company by Lot; the firſt Lot to plead for <hi>Laonice,</hi> and the laſt for me. Upon this he entreated them all, that they would be pleaſed to take theſe offices upon them, unto which they all conſented. The firſt Lot fell upon <hi>Hylas,</hi> and the laſt upon <hi>Phillis. Hylas</hi> he ſmiled, and ſaid thus; If I were now, as heretofore I was, a ſervant unto <hi>Laonice,</hi> I ſhould very hardly be perſwaded to argue in her behalf, that <hi>Tircis</hi> ought to love her; but now at this time, ſince I am all for <hi>Madonche,</hi> I am very willing to obey that God who ſo ordained it. Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> you may by this obſerve the great Providence of this Divinity, who to move one unto change, hath committed the charge of it unto unconſtant <hi>Hylas,</hi> as unto one who beſt knows the way; and to move one to a faithful amity, hath caſt the Lot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Shepheardeſſe that is firm and conſtant in her actions: Alſo ſuch a Judge is choſen as will not be partial: For <hi>Silvander</hi> is the moſt fit, ſince he is neither conſtant nor unconſtant in his affection, becauſe he never loved. Then <hi>Silvander</hi> began to ſpeak, and thus ſaid unto them: Since, <hi>Tircis</hi> and <hi>Laonice,</hi> you are both willing that I ſhould be the Judge of your differences, I ſhall require you both to ſwear, that you wil inviolably obſerve my Sentence, for otherwiſe the Gods may be the more incenſed, and all our labours loſt. Which both conſented unto, and then <hi>Hylas</hi> began in this manner.</p>

But ſince I am to argue the buſineſſe before you who has the heart of a man (I mean, who knowes the duties of a man well born) I cannot chuſe but be confident of a favourable judgment, and take it for almoſt certain, that if you were in the roome of <hi>Tircis,</hi> you would be extreamly aſhamed to be branded with ſuch a crime. I wil not ſtrive for any far fetcht reaſons, to approve that which is ſo abundantly cleere in it ſelfe: only ſhall hint thus much unto you, that the very name of man, does oblige him unto a confeſſion of his error. And the Lawes and ordinances both of heaven and nature, do all command him to diſpute no further in the cauſe. Does not the rules of courteſie and gratitude require, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation for benefits received? Does not heaven it ſelfe ſay, that all ſervices ought to be remunerated with ſome wages? And does not nature force him to love a faire woman who loves him and to abhor rather then to dote upon dead corps? But this man is a grand offend eragainſt all theſe ſacred Laws: for in lieu of all the great favour he hath received from <hi>Laonice</hi> he has returned high diſcourteſies; in lieu of all thoſe ſervices which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſſeth ſhe hath done him, ſerving him ſo long for a cloak of his amity to <hi>Cleon,</hi> he does pay her the wages of ingratitude: and for that dear affection which ſhe ever bore him even from her cradle, he anſwers her only with ſcorne. If thou beeſt a man <hi>Tircis,</hi> make it appeare thou doſt adore the gods, and recompence this fair ſhepheardeſſe, who has run ſo many hazards and miſeries for thy ſake. And if thou beeſt a man, then ſurely thou haſt the qualitie of one, which is, to love the living and not the dead: If thou doſt acknowledge the gods, doſt thou not know they uſe to puniſh ſuch as deſpiſe their ordinances? and that

                           <p>But admit, and ſuppoſe that this affection and ſervice being voluntary in <hi>Laonice</hi> and not courted or deſired by <hi>Tircis:</hi> yet ſurely I cannot beleeve, Oh juſt and wiſe <hi>Silvander,</hi> but you wil decree that a deceiver ought to make ſatisfaction unto the party deceived; and ſo by conſequence <hi>Tircis</hi> who has ſo long deluded this fair Shepheardeſſe by his diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and trickes, ought he not to repair the injury done her with a reall and unfaigned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection? He has long uſed lyes and falſities, let him at laſt uſe truths and honeſty; nor can I ever think you will decree that <hi>Tircis</hi> ſhould Love and live with a dead perſon and not a living: but will rather doome his Love to be beſtowed upon me that can love him again, rather then upon a few could aſhes in a coffin. But, good <hi>Tircis,</hi> tell me what thy deſigne is: when thou haſt drowned the ſad reliques of poor <hi>Cleon</hi> in a flood of teares, doſt thou think that it and all thy ſighes and groanes can ever raiſe her up again? Alas, <hi>Caron</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wafts any over but once, and is ever after deaf to all cries and calls; No no, <hi>Tircis,</hi> 'tis flat impiety to trouble the tranquillitie of thoſe whom the gods have called to themſelves: Amitie is ordained for the living, and coffins for the dead: do not then ſo prepoſterouſly, give thy affection unto the dead <hi>Cleon,</hi> and a coffin unto the living <hi>Laonice.</hi> This does not get thee the name of conſtant, for <hi>Cleon</hi> now has no intereſt in thee: muſt one alwaies go naked becauſe their firſt cloathes are worne? And that is no more ridiculous then to heare you ſay, that becauſe <hi>Cleon</hi> your old Miſtriſſe is worn away, therefore you will never have a new one. Fie fie; call your ſelfe to accompt: acknowledge your error; caſt your ſelf at the feeet of this fair one, acknowledg unto her your fault, and ſo avoid that ſentence unto which our juſt Judge by this ſentence will doom you.</p>

                           <p>Oh Fair <hi>Cleon,</hi> who out of heaven hears the injury that is offered unto thee, inſpire me with thy Divinity, for ſo I may wel eſteem thee, if vertue couldever make any humane perſon divine: and ſo furniſh me with ſoliditie of reaſons as I may make it moſt apparant that <hi>Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> ought never to love any but thy perfections. And you, prudent Judge, whoſe wiſdom is infinitly above my ſhallow conceptions, I beſeech you, let the abundance of reaſon which is in my cauſe, ſupply thoſe wants that are in me. And, to begin, Let me tell you <hi>Hylas,</hi> that all thoſe reaſons which you have inſtanced for a proof that the loving party ought to be loved again, though they be falſ, yet ſhall be allowed as good. But how can you conclude from them, that <hi>Tircis</hi> ought to betray the amitie of <hi>Cleon,</hi> by beginning a new love of <hi>Laonice?</hi> Theſe are impoſſibilities, and contradictions: Impoſſible, becauſe none is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged unto more then they can do. How would you have this Shepheard love when he has no will? You laugh <hi>Hylas,</hi> when you heare me ſay he has none. Faith, I do ſo, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> I pray what has he done with it? He that loves anſwered <hi>Phillis</hi> doth give his ſoul, it ſelf &amp; all its faculties unto the party loved; and ſo by con; equenee his wil is not in his power. But this <hi>Cleon,</hi> replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> being dead has nothing, and therefore <hi>Tircis</hi> ought to to take his own again.</p>
                           <p>Ah <hi>Hylas, Hylas,</hi> anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> you talke like an ignorant in Love; for ſuch gifts as are diſpoſed on by Loves authoritie are for ever irrevocable. Pray then, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> what is become of this will, ſince the death of <hi>Cleon?</hi> The leſſe followes the greater, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Phillis,</hi> if pleaſure be the object of the will, if that ceaſe to be a pleaſure, where's the will? And ſo it hath followed <hi>Cleon:</hi> if <hi>Cleon</hi> be not, then there is no will; for he had never had it but for her. But if <hi>Cleon</hi> be in ſome certain place, as our <hi>Druids</hi> hold, that ſhe is, then this will is in her hands, ſo contented in the place where ſhe is, that if ſhe her ſelfe would chaſe it away, ſhe cannot returne it to <hi>Tircis,</hi> as knowing well it would be in vain, but it goes into the grave, and reſts with her beloved Aſhes: this being ſo, why do you tax the faithful <hi>Tircis</hi> with ingratitude, if it be in his power to love any other? Alſo you do not only require things impoſſible, but alſo things in themſelves contraries; for if every one ought to love the party that loves, why ſhould he not then love <hi>Cleon,</hi> who never failed him in amitie? And as for the recompences which you demand, for the Services and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which <hi>Laonice</hi> carried: pray let her remember the contentment ſhe received by them, and how merry ſhe made herſelfe as long as this fallacie laſted, who otherwiſe would have droned out a dull and melancholy life. So as if ſhe balance the payment which the ſervice, I aſſure my ſelfe ſhe will think her ſelfe very well payed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You ſay, <hi>Hylas</hi> that <hi>Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> deceived her; but I ſay it was no deceipt, but a juſt puniſhment of love, who returned her own blows upon her ſelfe, for her intention was not to ſerve him, but to delude <hi>Cleon.</hi> Thus <hi>Silvander</hi> have I briefly anſwered the falſe reaſons of this Sheapheard: and there remaines no more, but to make <hi>Laonice</hi> confeſſe, that ſhe injured <hi>Tircis</hi> in her unjuſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing of him; which I ſhall eaſily do, if ſhe will be but pleaſed to anſwer me. Fair Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe, pray tell me, do you love <hi>Tircis?</hi> Shepheardeſſe, anſwered ſhe all that knowes me knowes I do. If he were forced to be abſent, replyed <hi>Phillis,</hi> and another in the mean time ſhould court you, would you not change affection? No, anſwered ſhe, for I would ſtill hope he would returne. If you heard that he would never return (ſaid <hi>Phillis)</hi> would you then ceaſe to love him?</p>
                           <p>No certainly, anſwered ſhe. Then, Fair <hi>Laonice</hi> anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> think it not ſtrange that <hi>Tircis</hi> who knowes that his <hi>Cleon</hi> is in heaven, that ſhe ſees all his actions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth in his fidelity, ſhould not change the affection he bore unto her: nor let this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of place ſeperate their loves, ſince all the hindrances of life could never do it. Do not beleeve what <hi>Hylas</hi> ſaid, that none ever returnes over the River <hi>Acheron;</hi> many that have been beloved of the gods, have both gone and come; and who knowes, but <hi>Cleon</hi> who was adorned with ſo many excellencies of ſoul, may find the ſame favour from Love: Oh <hi>Laonice!</hi> were but your eyes permitted to look upon Divinitie; you would ſee that <hi>Cleon</hi> to defend her own cauſe is in this place, and whiſpers theſe words into my eares, which I ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in her defence. Then would you confeſſe, that <hi>Hylas</hi> was in the wrong when he ſaid, that <hi>Tircis</hi> was mad to love her cold aſhes. Me thinks I ſee her in the midſt of us, and in lieu of a fragile body, ſubject unto humane accidents, ſhe is cloathed with glorious imor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53526:57"/>
and chiding <hi>Hylas</hi> for the blaſphemies he had breathed againſt her. What wouldſt thou anſwer, <hi>Hylas,</hi> if thy happy <hi>Cleon</hi> ſhould ſay thus unto thee? Wilt thou offer, O thou inconſtant wretch, to ſtain my <hi>Tircis</hi> with thy own inſidelity? If he did heretofore love me, doſt thou think it was my Body? If thou ſhouldſt anſwer, Yes, I would then reply, that then he ought to be condemned to love the aſhes which I have left in my Coffin, as long as they will laſt: For, a Lover never ought to retreat from a Love once begun. If thou doſt confeſſe that it was my Soul he loved, which was my principall part: then, Oh thou fond and unconſtant ſinner, why ſhould he now change his will, ſince ſhe is now more perfectly glorious than ever ſhe was? Otherwiſe, (ſuch is the miſery of the living) I ſhould be jealous I ſhould be vexed, and I ſhould be ſeen by many eyes as I am by his: But now I am delivered from ſuch mortall imperfections, and am no more capable of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities. And wouldſt thou, <hi>Hylas,</hi> with thy ſacrilegious perſwaſions, divert him from me, in whom I only lived upon earth? and, by a moſt barbarous cruelty, endeavour to give me a ſecond death? Oh! moſt horrid to hear: Theſe words, wiſe <hi>Silvander,</hi> do make ſuch a Turring ſound in my ears, as, I do believe, they will make your heart reſent them as well as mine. And therefore, to let this divinity argue the cauſe in your ſoul, I will be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent only let me hint thus much unto you, that Love is ſo juſt, as you your ſelfe ought to ſtand in awe of his puniſhing hand, if <hi>Laonice</hi>'s pitty, rather then <hi>Cleon</hi>'s reaſons, ſhould move you.</p>

                           <p>THe principall point in the cauſe debated before us, is, to know whether Love can die, by the death of the party loved Unto which I ſay, that the Love which is periſhable is not right Love; for, it ought to follow the ſubject which gave it life; and therefore thoſe who love only the Body, ought to encloſe their love of that body in the ſame Coffin where it is; but, ſuch as love the Soul, ought, with their love, to flie after this loved Soul, as far as the higheſt heavens, and no diſtance ought to ſeparate them. All theſe things therefore well conſidered, I do ordain, that <hi>Tircis</hi> do love his <hi>Cleon</hi> ſtill; and that the two Loves which are in us, the one do follow the Body into the grave, and the other the Soul into heaven. That <hi>Tircis</hi> do not any more diſturb the reſt of <hi>Cleon's</hi> Soul, by any compliance unto the importunities of <hi>Laonice.</hi> This is the Will of the gods pronounced by me.</p>
                           <p>Having thus given Sentence, not ſtaying to hear the complaints of <hi>Laonice</hi> and <hi>Hylas,</hi> he made a low congie unto <hi>Leonida</hi> and the reſt of the company, and went away without any company, but <hi>Phillis,</hi> who would not tarry to hear the ſad reſentments of this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe. And becauſe it was late, <hi>Leonida</hi> went that night unto <hi>Diana's</hi> houſe, with all the reſt of the Shepheards and Shepheardeſſes, except <hi>Laonice,</hi> who was ſo extreamly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> as ſhe ſwore, ſhe would not go out of that Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe had done them ſome remarkable diſpleaſure. It ſeemes fortune did conduct her as ſhe deſired; for having left the company, and ſitting down in the wood where ſhe might with more liberty lament her diſaſters, her better Genius did repreſent before the eyes of her fancy, the inſupportable diſdain of <hi>Tircis,</hi> how he was unworthy of her Love, and was ſo aſhamed of his fault, as ſhe vowed a thouſand times to hate him, and, for his ſake, both <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Phillis.</hi> Whilſt theſe things thus paſſed in her memory, it hapned, that <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas,</hi> who, of late, was diſpleaſed with <hi>Phillis,</hi> for ſome coldneſſe towards him, eſpied <hi>Silvander</hi> and her talking together. 'Tis true, this Shepheardeſſe was not altogether ſo full of triviall expreſſions of Love to him, as 'ſhe was before her frequent aſſociation with <hi>Diana</hi> for that new amitie together with the delight which <hi>Aſtrea, Diana,</hi> and ſhe took in being together, did ſo much take her up, as ſhe minded not thoſe fond trifles of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which nouriſhed the love of <hi>Lycidas;</hi> ſo as he had a conceit, that the reaſon why ſhe was not ſo converſant with him as before, was ſome new Love which had diverted her from him: and not being able to imagine who it ſhould be, that ſhe now loved, he went wandring up and down in places moſt melancholy and unfrequented, that he might with more freedome lament his miſeries: And as ill luck was, he ſpied, as I told you before,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53526:57"/>
                              <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> in diſcourſe together, which ſight did not a little increaſe his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie; for, knowing the merits of the Shepheard and Shepheardeſſe, he eaſily believed, that <hi>Silvander,</hi> who never yet loved any, had beſtowed himſelfe upon her; and that ſhe, according to the humour of her Sex, did willingly accept of the gift.</p>
                           <p>Theſe conſiderations did much ſtir up his ſuſpition; but much more, when they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by him, and not ſeeing him, be heard, or thought he heard, the words of a Lover; and thoſe perhaps were only ſome repetition of <hi>Silvander</hi>'s ſentence. But, to put himſelfe out of all patience, it happened, that having let them paſſe by, he did riſe out of the place where he was, and becauſe he would not follow them, took the contrary way, and as fortune would have it, he did ſit down neer the place where <hi>Laonice</hi> was, who all this while never ſaw him. After he had a while nurſed upon his miſhaps, and being tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the thoughts of them, he cryed out aloud, Oh Love! is it poſſible thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſuffer ſuch an injury to paſſe unpuniſhed? Wilt thou recompenſe wrongs and ſervices with equall favours? Afterwards, being a while ſilent, with croſſed armes, and eyes turned up to the skies, he breathed out many a ſad ſigh, and then began again.</p>
                           <p>I plainly ſee, that there is not any conſtancy in any woman: <hi>Phillis,</hi> becauſe ſhe will ſhew that ſhe is of the ſame Sex, and though otherwiſe full of perfection, yet in this ſhe is ſubject to her Sexes naturall inconſtancy. <hi>Phillis,</hi> I ſay, of whoſe affection I have been heretofore more aſſured, than of my own will. But Oh, my Shepheardeſſe, am I not the very ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame <hi>Lycidas</hi> that I was before, and whoſe affection has been ſo welcome unto you? Muſt I now be caſt off, and <hi>Silvander</hi> ſucced in my happineſſe? a ſtranger a vagabond, a man that all the world deſpiſeth, and cannot own him for any poſſeſſor of any part in it. <hi>Laonice,</hi> who overheard, hearing him name <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Silvander,</hi> and being deſirous to know more, ſhe began to hearken more attentively, ſo as ſhe heard him utter the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thoughts, both of himſelfe and <hi>Phillis:</hi> and from thence ſhe reſolved to ſooth him up in his opinion, aſſuring her ſelfe, that if <hi>Phillis</hi> loved <hi>Lycidas,</hi> ſhe ſhould make him jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; and if ſhe loved <hi>Silvander,</hi> ſhe would ſo divulge it to the world, that every one ſhould know it. So when <hi>Lycidas</hi> was gone, for his tormented minde would not let him belong in one place, ſhe came out of her lurking place, and following after, ſhe overtook him as he was talking to <hi>Corilas,</hi> whom he met upon the way; and faigning to enquire ſome newes of a diſconſolate Shepheard, they anſwered, that they knew of no ſuch. He is a Shepheard, ſaid ſhe, who wanders up and down lamenting a dead Shepheardeſſe; and I am told he uſeth to be every afternoon in the company of the fair Shepheardeſſe, <hi>Phillis,</hi> and her Servant. Her Servant, anſwered <hi>Lycidas,</hi> who is that? I know not, ſaid ſhe, but it is ſuch a name as <hi>Silander</hi> or <hi>Silvander,</hi> or ſome ſuch like; he is of a middle ſtature, his face ſomething long, and of a very pleaſing humour when he will. But who told you, replied <hi>Lycidas,</hi> that he was her Servant? Both their actions, anſwered ſhe; for I know what I have both ſeen and heard of them: But, I pray tell me, if you know any way how I ſhould meet with him I look for? <hi>Lycidas</hi> was ſo ſurpriſed, that he could not anſwer a word; but <hi>Corilas</hi> told her, that if ſhe followed on that path, it would bring her through the wood into a Meadow, where they uſed to aſſemble; and leſt ſhe ſhould loſe her way, he would be her companion if ſhe pleaſed. She ſeemed as if ſhe did not know the way, and was very glad of his courteous offer: So bidding goodnight unto <hi>Lycidas,</hi> went along with her companion. But <hi>Lycidas</hi> was ſo much out of himſelfe, that he ſtood ſtill immovable a long while; but at laſt, recollecting himſelfe, he ruminated upon the words of this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe, unto which he could not chuſe but give much credit. It would be too long to relate his dolefull expreſſions and injuries he did unto the faithfull <hi>Phillis.</hi> But all the night long he wandred in the thick wood, and in the morning he was ſo tired out with his woes and walking, that he was forced to lie down under a tree, and with eyes ſwelled with tears, at the laſt he fell aſleep.</p>
                           <p>Aſſoon as day did break <hi>Diana, Aſtrea,</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> did riſe, to the end they might be ready to wait upon <hi>Leonida,</hi> as ſoon as ſhe was up; but ſhe was ſo much taken with their ſweetneſſe and courteſy, that ſhe had dreſſed her ſelfe by the firſt dawning of the day, that ſhe might not miſſe a minute of their company, whilſt ſhe ſtayed with them; ſo as theſe Shepheardeſſes, when they opened her Chamber dore, did all wonder at her earlineſſe; and after all had done their morning complement, they went out of the houſe, to begin the ſame exerciſes which they had the day before; and aſſoon as ever they came into the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, they eſpied <hi>Silvander,</hi> who, under the colour of a faigned courtſhip of <hi>Diana,</hi> began to be really in earneſt, and in love with her: He was ſo intent upon this new growing love,

that he had not cloſed an eye all the night, but ſtill paſſed away the time in thinking upon the diſcourſe and geſtures of <hi>Diana,</hi> which he had ſeen and heard the day before; ſo as <hi>Aurora</hi> no ſooner began to viſit his window, but he was up, and waited for the coming of his new Miſtreſſe; and as ſoon as he ſaw her, he ſung theſe Verſes as he met her.</p>

                              <hi>Phillis</hi> being of a very merry and pleaſant humour, reſolved to undertake the task that was impoſed upon her; therefore turning off towards <hi>Diana,</hi> Miſtreſſe (ſaid ſhe) you muſt take heed what this Shepheard ſaies unto you; for, yeſterday he did not love you, but to day he is ready to die for love of you: he ſhould have begun ſooner to ſerve you, or elſe have ſtayed longer, before he uſed any ſuch language as this. <hi>Silvander</hi> was ſo neer as to hear this: and therefore ſaid, I beſeech you faireſt Miſtreſſe, ſtop your ears from the detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting language of my enemy. Muſt you needs, <hi>Phillis,</hi> build up your own happineſſe by the ruine of mine? Dare you, <hi>Silvander,</hi> (anſwered <hi>Phillis)</hi> be ſo bold, as to ſpeak of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe before <hi>Diana's</hi> face? I wonder what impudent phraſes you will uſe behinde her back, who aſſume to your ſelfe ſo much before her face? Would you have my Miſtreſſe to think, that it is not my happineſſe to ſerve her (ſaid <hi>Silvander)?</hi> and why, I pray, ſhould I not tell it is ſo, ſince it is nothing but a moſt certain truth? You may as well ſay, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> that ſhe does love you, and cannot live out of your ſight. I do not ſay ſo, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Silvander;</hi> but, let me ſay unto you by way of anſwer, that I wiſh with all my heart, it were ſo: But, do you think it ſo ſtrange, I ſhould ſay, that I think it a happineſſe to ſerve my Miſtreſſe? If you do, I pray let me ask, what happineſſe do you finde in ſerving her? Though I ſhould think it a happineſſe, replyed <hi>Phillis,</hi> yet ſurely, I would not brag of it. It is ingratitude, replyed <hi>Silvander,</hi> to receive a benefit and not to give thanks for it; and how is it poſſible to love a perſon that is ungratefull? From hence I judge (ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> and interrupted) that <hi>Phillis</hi> does not love <hi>Diana.</hi> Moſt will concur in that judgment, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Silvander,</hi> and I believe, <hi>Diana</hi> her ſelf does think ſo. I beſeech you, ſhew your reaſon for this opinion, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> if you think to bring me into it. The Affirmative part, ſaid <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander,</hi> muſt alwaies be proved, and not the Negative: The queſtion is, whether or no you do love <hi>Diana?</hi> You affirm, and I deny it; and therefore it is your part to prove it. <hi>Phillis</hi> was at a ſtand for an anſwer, when <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſaid, Siſter, do you hear and allow of what the Shepheard ſaies? I do hear, but not allow of it, anſwered ſhe, for I ſhould be put upon a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53526:58"/>
hard task to prove it. If ſo (ſaid <hi>Diana)</hi> I muſt think you do not love me: for, <hi>Silvander</hi> demands nothing but what is reaſon. Upon this, the Shepheard addreſſed himſelfe unto <hi>Diana,</hi> and ſaid unto her, Moſt fair, and no leſſe juſt, Miſteſſe, it is now impoſſible my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my can be ſo impudent as to ſay, that I have not an infinite happineſſe in ſerving you, you are pleaſed to give ſuch a favourable anſwer in my behalfe. By <hi>Diana's</hi> ſaying, that <hi>Phillis</hi> does not love her, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> ſhe does not thereby ſay, that you do love her, or that ſhe loves you. Should I but hear ſuch heavenly words, anſwered he, come from the mouth of my Miſtreſſe, as, <hi>I do love you,</hi> or, <hi>You do love me,</hi> I ſhould not only think this a happineſſe, but be raviſhed with joy, and yet ſince ſhe is ſilent, it argues a conſent unto what ſhe heares: Why therefore may I not ſay, that ſhe confeſſeth ſhe loves me? Did Love conſiſt in words, replyed <hi>Phillis,</hi> you are more in love than all men I know, put together; and you can argue a bad Cauſe better than any Lawyer. <hi>Leonida</hi> was ſo delighted with the diſcourſe of theſe Shepheardeſſes, that had ſhe not been troubled for <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſhe could have ſtayed amongſt them as long as ſhe had lived: And that was the reaſon ſhe deſired them to walk with her towards the River-ſide, homewards; and they were very ready to wait upon her: for, beſides the complement of common courteſie, they were much delighted in her company.</p>
                           <p>So then, ſhe taking <hi>Diana</hi> on the one ſide and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> on the other, they walked along; but <hi>Silvander</hi> was further from <hi>Diana</hi> than <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſhe having taken that place which he deſired; at which the vain-glorious <hi>Phillis</hi> was not a little glad, and laught at the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, ſaying, that her Miſtreſſe might eaſily judge which of them was moſt ready to ſerve her, ſince ſhe had applied her ſelfe ſo officiouſly to be near her, and he never cared. My Miſtreſſe, anſwered he, did admit you to the honour of that place, for your importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities ſake, and not your affection for had you loved her, you would have ſuffered me to enjoy that place which you do. Nay rather the contrary, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> if I had let any come neerer her than my ſelfe: For, a Lover thinks he can never be neer enough the perſon Loved. That Lover, anſwered <hi>Silvander,</hi> who regards his own particular contentment more, then the contentment of the party Loved, does not deſerve the title of a Lover ſo as you regarding your own delight, in being ſo neer your Miſtreſſe, more then her ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it cannot be ſaid you do love her, but your ſelfe only; for, were I in your room, I ſhould lead her, and help her to walk, whereas you do only trouble her. Did my Miſtreſſe ſcold with me as you do, replyed <hi>Phillis,</hi> I know not whether I ſhould love her or no. I am moſt certain, ſaid the Shepheard, that, were I in lieu of your Miſtreſſe, I ſhould never love you. How dare you offer ſuch an affront, as to ſay, you think you ſhould not love her upon any condition? This, <hi>Phillis,</hi> is a grand maxime in the Law of Love, that thoſe who can think they cannot love upon any conditions, are no Lovers: for, Love does not admit of any Ifs or Conditions, but is alwaies abſolute.</p>
                           <p>Miſtreſſe, I demand juſtice, and require it on the part of Love, that you puniſh this crime of ſo high a nature, and that you will remove her from that place which is too ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable for her, that thinks ſhe ſhall not love; and place me in the room, who lives on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to love you. Miſtreſſe, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> I perceive, that this envier at my happineſſe will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver let me alone, untill I quit the place; and I fear he will, with his ſmooth language, move you to conſent unto it: and therefore, with your favour, I will leave it unto him, upon condition, that he tell you one thing which I ſhall ask him. <hi>Silvander</hi> never ſtaying for the anſwer of <hi>Diana,</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> The condition is eaſie, and I will never refuſe it; ſince without it, I ſhould never conceal any thing which ſhe deſires to know. Then <hi>Phillis</hi> did yield him the place, and ſaid unto him, Envious Shepheard, though the place is not to be bought and ſold, yet, you have promiſed more for it than you are aware; for, you are obliged to tell us who you are, and what occaſion brought you into this Country: for, you have been long amongſt us, and we are all ignorant of what you are. <hi>Leonida,</hi> who was very deſirous to know who <hi>Silvander</hi> was, ſaid unto <hi>Phillis</hi> thus, Believe me, <hi>Phillis,</hi> you have ſhewed much prudence in this propoſition; for I believe none here, but does much deſire the ſame ſatisfaction. I wiſh, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> that I could ſatisfie your deſires; but Fortune hath ſo denyed it unto me, as I may well ſay, that I am more deſirous, and almoſt as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it as you are: For, Fate only ſent me into the world, lets me know that I do live, but conceals from me all other knowledge of my ſelfe: And that you ſhould not believe that I am any thing unwilling to perform my promiſe, I do ſwear unto you by all the gods, and by the beauty of <hi>Diana,</hi> that I will truly tell you all that I know of my ſelf.</p>

                  <hi>The Hiſtory of</hi> Silvander.</head>
               <p>WHen <hi>Aetius</hi> was Lieutenant General in <hi>Gaul</hi> unto the Emperour <hi>Valentinian,</hi> hee thought it very dangerous unto the Romans, that <hi>Gondeoch</hi> the firſt King of the <hi>Burgundians</hi> ſhould be poſſeſſed of the greateſt part, and therefore reſolved to drive him out, and drive him on the other ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> from whence he came a little before, when <hi>Stilico,</hi> for the good ſervice he had done the Romans againſt <hi>Radagriſe</hi> the <hi>Goth,</hi> gave him the ancient Provinces of the <hi>Authunois,</hi> and <hi>Seguinois,</hi> and <hi>Allobroges,</hi> whom he named <hi>Burgundy,</hi> without the command of <hi>Valentinian:</hi> and it is to be thought he did it, onely to get all the Forces of the Empire into his own hands: But the Emperour, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his hands full of many enemies, as the <hi>Goths,</hi> the <hi>Huns,</hi> the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and the <hi>Franks,</hi> who were ready to fall upon him in ſeveral places, he commanded <hi>Aetius</hi> to let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in peace which was not ſo ſoon put into execution, but firſt the <hi>Burgundians</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received great routs, and their enemies made ſuch ravage and waſte, as they carried away with them all they found.</p>
               <p>I then being ſome five or ſix years of age, was with many others carried away unto the utmoſt Town of the <hi>Allobroges,</hi> by ſome <hi>Burgundians,</hi> who out of revenge went into thoſe Countries that were confederate with their enemies, and committed the ſame diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which they had received. I cannot tell you why they took me, unleſſe in ſome hopes of money for a ranſom; but my fortune was ſo kind unto me, as I fell into the hands of an <hi>Helvetian,</hi> who had an old and very rich Father, and who taking a liking to me, either for my phyſiognomy, or ſome pleaſing anſwer which my young Genius gave him, did take me unto himſelf, with intention to educate me in Literature: And though the Son was much againſt it, yet the Father continued his deſign, and ſpared no coſt or care to inſtruct me in all Learning, ſending me unto the Univerſities of the <hi>Muſſilians,</hi> in the Province of the Romans. So as I may very well ſay, that I had been loſt if I had not been loſt. However though nothing was more ſutable to my Genius than Learning, yet was it a continual tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto me, to be ignorant from whence and who I was; thinking ſtill this to bee a greater misfortune than hapned unto any other. And being much troubled at it, a friend adviſed me to enquire the truth from the Oracle, for I was ſo young when I was firſt taken, that my memory could not inform me any thing of my birth, or parents, or place from whence I came; but this friend had ſuch a perſwaſive power over me, that both of us went together unto the Oracle, and the anſwer which we received was this.</p>

               <p>Judge (fair <hi>Diana)</hi> what ſatisfaction I received from this anſwer. For my part, I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſit ſtill and enquire no further, ſince it was impoſſible to know any more, unleſs I dyed; but lived afterwards in much more tranquillity of mind, referring my ſelf unto the conduct of heaven, and applying my ſelf unto my ſtudies, in which I was ſo good a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, that old <hi>Abariel</hi> (for that was the name of his Father who took me away) had a longing deſire to ſee me before hee dyed. Being come unto him, and entertained as well as I could wiſh, one day when I was alone with him in his chamber, he ſpoke thus unto me.</p>
               <p>My Son (for ſo have I ever eſteemed you, ſince the rigour of War brought you into my hands) I do not think you to be ſo ignorant of what I have done for you, as to make any
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53526:59"/>
doubt of my good will towards you. Yet if my cares to inſtruct your youth have not given you a knowledge of it, I will; becauſe I do intend very well towards you. You know that my Son <hi>Ahazides,</hi> who took you, and brought you to me, hath a Daughter as dear unto me as my ſelf: And becauſe I deſire to ſpend thoſe few dayes I have to live, in reſt and tranquillity, I do intend to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> you unto her, and to beſtow upon you ſuch a portion of my eſtate, as I may live with you as long as it ſhall pleaſe the Gods. Doe not think, that this is a leight and random deſign, but a thing of mature and long deliberation; for having by a well experienced knowledge found, your inclinations ſutable unto my mind, I reſolved to eſtabliſh the tranquillity of my old age in you, and therefore ſent you to the Univerſities, knowing that nothing renders a ſoul more capable of reaſon than lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and knowledge doth: And in your abſence I have ſo diſpoſed my Grandchild to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you, as ſhe out of her complacency to me, is contented, and deſires it as much as my ſelf. 'Tis very true, ſhe much deſires to know, what, and from whence you are; and for her ſatisfaction. I have often enquired of <hi>Azahides</hi> who took you, but he could give no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwer, but that he found you about the River <hi>Roſne</hi> and out of the Province of <hi>Vie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſe;</hi> but perhaps you might better remember, ſince you were then ſome five or ſix yeares old: And asking him, whether your habit could not give him any knowledge of your Parents, he anſwered, No; and that you were ſo young, that there was no gheſſing at your Quality by your habit. So as, my Son, if your own memory cannot give you any light un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our knowledge, none elſe can.</p>
               <p>Then the good old <hi>Abariel</hi> took me by the hand, and prayed me to tell him, all that I knew, or could remember of my ſelf. To whom, after many expreſſions of gratitude and obligations to him for my education, and this propoſal of Marriage, I anſwered him, that truly I was ſo very young when I was taken, as I could not remember any thing either of my Parents or Quality. I am extreamly ſorry for it (replied the good old man); but ſince it cannot be helped, I will not ſo much as mention my deſign unto <hi>Azahides,</hi> until I know how you approve of this my deſign. And I anſwering him, that I ſhould be too ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full if I did not wholly obey him in all things, he cauſed me to retire, and ſent for his Son, to acquaint him with his intentions, who did abſolutely reject the motion, and would by no means hear of it. Afterwards, the good old man, ſince he could not obtain his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent freely told him thus much; <hi>Ahazides</hi> (ſaid he unto him) if you will not beſtow your Daughter upon whom I would, I will beſtow my eſtate upon whom you would not: Therefore either marry her unto <hi>Silvander,</hi> or elſe I will make him my heir. <hi>Ahazides,</hi> who was of a very covetous diſpoſition, and feared to loſe the eſtate, ſeeing his Father ſo peremptory, did ſeem to bend a little, and deſired ſome daies of conſideration, which the good old man did conſent unto, deſiring to doe all things by ſweetneſs and lenity, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to acquaint me, but he needed not; for I found it by the eyes and diſcourſe of his Son, who begun to chide and uſe me ſo ill as I was not able to endure it. Then during the time of conſideration which was prefixed, he commanded his daughter, who was much better than her father, upon pain of death (for he was a man of a bloody and murtherous temper) to ſeem unto the good old man, as if ſhe were very ſorry her father was not confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable unto his will, and that ſhe therefore would obey him, and would be ready to marry me privately: And all this was only a deſign to murder me. The poor Grandchild was extreamly perplexed; for on the one ſide the menaces of her cruel father did terrifie her; on the other ſide, her affection unto me would not permit her tender years to ſuch a piece of cruelty, ſo as in a trembling manner ſhe came to the good old man, and told him, that ſhe would marry me ſecretly: And then it was ſo concluded upon. So as the good man did abſolutely command me to be ready, and I, notwithſtanding all my doubts, durſt not diſobey.</p>
               <p>The Plot was ſo laid, that I ſhould climb up to the window of her chamber, and there marry her ſecretly. The houſe was ſeated upon the Lake <hi>Lemane,</hi> where the waves did beat againſt it, and then fell into the <hi>Roſne,</hi> which runs through the middle of it. The deſign of <hi>Azahides</hi> was to draw me up with a rope to the middle of the wall, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to let me fall into the Lake: where being drowned, no news would be heard of me: for, the <hi>Roſne,</hi> which runs with a monſtrous impetuoſity, would have carried me quite away. A thouſand to one, but his deſign had been executed; for I was fully reſolved to obey the good old <hi>Abariel,</hi> had not his poor Grandchild moved with compaſſion, and horrour of the fact, acquainted me with it, the very day before it ſhould have been done: And in a trembling manner ſaid thus unto me: You ſee, <hi>Silvander,</hi> that in ſaving your
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53526:60"/>
life, I do run the hazard of my own death; for I know that <hi>Ahazides</hi> will never pardon me, but however, I had rather die innocent, than live guilty of your death. After my many thanks, I told her, that ſhe needed not to fear the fury of <hi>Ahazides;</hi> for I would take a courſe both for her ſafety and my own, but told her that ſhe muſt be ſure to be ſecret. Againſt the appointed night I provided my ſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the mony I could get, unknown to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariel:</hi> And when the appointed hour was come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </gap> had taken my leave of the good old man, who came with me to the water ſide, I went into the little Boat which hee had provided for me. Then going under the window, I made a ſhew as if I had tyed my ſelf unto the rope, but it was only my clothes ſtuffed full of Sand; then puſhing my ſelf a little on one ſide to ſee what would be done, I heard it preſently fall into the Lake, where, with my Our I beat the water, that they hearing the noiſe, might think it was I who was flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in the water: But I was quickly forced to put further off; for they caſt down ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtories, as I came hardly off with my life. Preſently after I ſaw a light in the window, and fearing to be diſcovered, I layd my ſelf all along in the Boat; and ſo they did not ſee me, but thought the Boat floated away of it ſelf. Then, when every one was gone from the window. I heard a great noiſe by the water ſide where I left <hi>Abariel:</hi> and as I thought, I heard his cry, cauſed by my fall into the water, and fearing I was drown'd; but I did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve not to return, though extreamly ſorry that I ſhould not ſerve the good old <hi>Abariel</hi> in his old age: But being aſſured of <hi>Ahazides</hi> his ill will unto me, I knew that though not at this time, yet at ſome other he would execute his murtherous intention: So as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Land at the place where I had layd other clothes, and the beſt of my things, I took them, and leaving my Boat. I betook my ſelf to Land, and travelled ſo long, that, extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weary, I arrived at <hi>Evians</hi> at the break of day, and was forced there to reſt my tyred limbs all the day; where not being known, I went, as many others did upon urgent occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ask advice of the ſage <hi>Belinda,</hi> who was Miſtris of all the Veſtals about the Lake; and who, as ſince I underſtand, is Mother unto my fair Miſtris. Having acquainted her with all my diſaſters, ſhe conſulted with the Oracle, and the next day told me, that the gods did command me not to wonder at my afflictions, and that if I would ever come out of them, it was neceſſary I ſhould look into the Fountain of the Verity of Love, becauſe in that water was my onely remedy. And that as ſoon as I ſaw my ſelf in it, I ſhould know my Father and my Country. And asking her in what place that Fountain was, ſhe told me it was in this Country of <hi>Forreſts.</hi> Then ſhe told me the property and inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it, ſo courteouſly, as I thought my ſelf infinitely obliged unto her.</p>
               <p>Upon this, I reſolved to come hither, where at my firſt coming I met with <hi>Celadon,</hi> from whom I had information where this admirable Fountain was: But as I was in my way to it, I fell ſo ſick, as I was forced to keep my chamber ſix months: And when I was wel, I underſtood from ſome about that place, how a Magician, at the inſtance of <hi>Clida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> had ſet two Lyons and two Unicorns to guard it, and that the Inchantment could not be diſinchanted but by the death of two of the moſt perfect Lovers that ever came into this Country.</p>
               <p>Heavens know how much I was grieved at this news, ſince it had ſo prevented me in my ſo much deſired hopes. However, ſince this was the Country which the Heavens had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to give me knowledge of my Parents, I thought it beſt for me to ſtay in it; hoping that at laſt theſe two Lovers ſo faithful, might be found out: But certainly it was ſo rare a thing to be found, as I had little reaſon for my hopes. But with this deſign I put my ſelf into the garb of a Shepheard, that I might more freely enjoy the company of thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the River <hi>Lignon:</hi> And to be the more acceptable unto them, I beſtowed the reſt of my mony in a flock of Sheep, and building a little Cabin.</p>
               <p>This, fair <hi>Leonida,</hi> is all I doe know of my ſelf: And this is the price of that Room which I have bought of <hi>Phillis.</hi> I am very glad to know ſo much (anſwered <hi>Leonida)</hi> &amp; do hope your fortune will be good, ſince the gods doe ſeem to have a care of it by their Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: and for my part, I am a very zealous wiſher of it. So am not I (ſaid <hi>Phillis)</hi> nor do I wiſh he may ever come to the knowledge of his Parents: For if he ſhould perhaps their merits might work much upon my Miſtris: For matter of Eſtate and Alliance, is more conſidered in Mariages, than the love or merit of the party. See ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> how you underſtand it; you are not ſo much againſt me, but that I hope by your means to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the knowledge of that which I ſo much deſire. By my means, ſaid ſhe, how can that be? Yes by your means, ſaid <hi>Silvander;</hi> for ſince the Lyons muſt be quelled by the blood of two faithful Lovers, why ſhould not I beleeve that you and I are they? Well may I
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53526:60"/>
be faithfull, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> but I am ſure I am not valiant, I ſhall love my Miſtriſſe as much as any in the world; but as for matter of life, I pray you pardon me; for what ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice could I do unto her if I were dead. I aſſure you, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> I do value both your lives infinitly above your deaths, and had rather be my ſelfe in dainger of death, then to ſee either of you ſo for my ſake.</p>
               <p>Whilſt they were thus diſcourſing and comming neer to the bridge of <hi>Boutreſſe,</hi> they eſpyed a man a far off comming very faſt; and when he was neerer, <hi>Leonida</hi> knew him to be <hi>Paris,</hi> Son to the great Druide, <hi>Adamas,</hi> who being returned from <hi>Feurs,</hi> and hearing that his Neece was to look for him, did ſend his Son to acquaint her that he was returned: alſo to know what occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moved her to come ſo alone, it not being her cuſtom to go with out company. As ſoon as ſhe knew <hi>Paris,</hi> ſhe named him unto the Fair Shepheardeſſes, and they according to their habituall civility, when he came neere them did ſalute him with abundance of courteſie ſo as had not the carreſſes of <hi>Leonida</hi> a little diverted him, he could hardly have concealed his ſudden ſurpriſe. Yet after the firſt complements were paſt, and after he had delivered his Meſſage unto her. But Siſter (ſaid he for ſo <hi>Adamas</hi> would have them call one another) how came you to meet with ſuch Fair and good company? Truly Brother, anſwered ſhe, A good fate brought me to them and I have been two dayes together, neverleſſe weary in my life then with them. This ſaid ſhe, and pointed to <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> is the Fair Shepheardeſſe ſo famed, and deſervedly for her beauty. Her name is <hi>Aſtrea:</hi> and that, poynting at <hi>Diana,</hi> is the Daughter of <hi>Belinda</hi> and <hi>Celion:</hi> The other is called <hi>Phillis:</hi> and This Shepheard is the unknowne <hi>Silvander,</hi> whoſe merits yet are ſo known as all the Country does love him. I ſwear, ſaid <hi>Paris,</hi> my Father feares of your falling into ill company, were groundleſſe and had he known you had been ſo well, I am ſure he would not have been ſo much diſquieted as he is.</p>
               <p>Generous <hi>Paris,</hi> ſaid <hi>Silvander</hi> a perſon that is owner of ſo much vertue as this Fair Nymph is, can never be ill accompanied eſpecially being amongſt ſo many wiſe and fair Shepheardeſſes as theſe. Upon theſe words he looked upon <hi>Diana,</hi> who conceiving her ſelfe invited to it, anſwered; it is impoſſible, noble <hi>Paris,</hi> to add any thing unto that which is already compleat, but yet, ſaid <hi>Paris,</hi> I had much rather be with her, when ſhe is with you, than when ſhe is alone. This, Sir, proceeds from the fluency of your courteſie, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſhe that are pleaſed to uſe ſuch language unto ſtrangers: You cannot ſay that you are ſtrangers unto me, ſaid <hi>Paris,</hi> unleſſe you ſay that I am a ſtranger unto you, which indeed is a ſhame unto me, that I ſhould be ſo neer a neighbour unto ſo many beauties of ſo much merit, and yet ſhould ſcarcely know them: but I am moſt extreamly ſorry for my fault and ſhall for the future endeavour to repaire it: As he ſaid ſo, he turned towards the Nymph, and, you Siſter, ſaid he, though I came alone, and intended to wait upon you from hence to <hi>Adamas,</hi> yet I muſt needs ſtay here untill night. I ſhould be glad, ſaid ſhe if I could do the like: but I am now forced to go about my buſineſſe, yet I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved ſo to ſettle all my affaires, as to live amongſt theſe wiſe and fair Shepheardeſſes: for I cannot think any life upon earth, ſo happy as theirs. With ſuch expreſſions as theſe ſhe took leave of the fair Shepheardeſſes, after a hundred imbraces and promiſes to returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain very ſhortly; and went away ſo very well contented, as ſhe reſolved to quit the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Court, for the ſimplicity of this life: but her greateſt inducement unto it, was her deſigne of getting <hi>Celadon</hi> out of <hi>Galatheas</hi> hand, and becauſe ſhe thought he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently returne unto this town, where ſhe intended to work upon him under the ſhadow of theſe Shepheardeſſes.</p>
               <p>This was the voyage of <hi>Leonida,</hi> who in her progreſſe, ſaw the beginning of two great loves; that of <hi>Silvander</hi> under the umbrage of a wager, and that of <hi>Paris</hi> both unto <hi>Diana:</hi> for <hi>Paris</hi> did ever ſince this day, fall ſo extreamly in love with her, that to get more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with her, he quitted his accuſtomed life, and put on the habit of a Shepheard, and would be called ſo purpoſely to render himſelfe more amiable in the eye of his Miſtris, who for her part did honour him, as his merits and good inclination to her did oblige her: but becauſe we have much to ſay of them, in the ſequell of our diſcourſe, therefore we will ſay no more of them now.</p>
               <p>Returning then unto the Town as they paſſed through the plain where commonly their flocks did feed, they eſpy'd a far off <hi>Tircis, Hylas,</hi> &amp; <hi>Lycidas,</hi> the two firſt of which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by their actions to be in a very earneſt argument: for the head, the arms, &amp; every part of <hi>Hylas</hi> did ſpeak as much: As for <hi>Lycidas,</hi> he was all in himſelfe, his hat pulled down o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his eyes; his armes foulded, and looking upon his feet, did ſhew there was ſomthing which much affected his ſoul. And when they were within the ken of each other, <hi>Hylas</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:53526:61"/>
eſpying <hi>Phillis</hi> amongſt the Shepheardeſſes; he left <hi>Tircis</hi> and went to her, then without any ſalute unto the reſt of the company, he took her by the hand, and according to the uſuall freedom of his humour; in plain tearmes he told her, how great a deſire he had to ſerve her. <hi>Phillis</hi> being glad to paſſe away the time with him, ſaid thus, I do not know <hi>Hylas,</hi> from whence this deſire of yours ſhould grow. For there is nothing in me which can invite it: if you do beleeve what you ſay, anſwered he, then you are ſo much the more beholding to me; and if you do not beleeve it, then you muſt think me to be a man of judgement, and knowes who deſerves my ſervice, and ſo you muſt the more eſteem me for it. Never doubt, ſaid ſhe, but however I ſhall eſteem you, and accept of your amitie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the merits of its deſert, were it for no other conſideration, but becauſe you are the firſt that ever loved me.</p>
               <p>As fortune was, <hi>Lycidas</hi> came in, juſt as theſe words were ſpoken, whoſe jealouſie was already grown to ſuch a height, as it did ſurpaſſe his affection; and as ill luck was, he came time enough to hear the anſwer which <hi>Hylas</hi> returned unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> which was this: I know not, Fair <hi>Shepheardeſſe,</hi> whether you will continue unto me the ſame goodneſſe you have begun; but if you do, I am ſure <hi>Silvander</hi> will forbid the banes; and, if to pleaſe you, he do not, yet I am ſure, that all thoſe who ſaw him yeſterday with you, will teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that he is your ſervant: I cannot tell whether or no he left his love under his Pillow, but if he did not, you are his Miſtreſſe. <hi>Silvander</hi> never thought of <hi>Lycidas</hi> his love unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> but thinking it were a ſhame for him to diſavow what <hi>Hylas</hi> ſaid, alſo concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving he ſhould offend <hi>Phillis</hi> if he ſhould; eſpecially before her face; he anſwered thus unto him: Shepheard, you need not ſeek for any other teſtimony in this matter, but my ſelf: Never think, that the Shepheards of <hi>Lignon</hi> can ſo ſoon put on &amp; off their affection they are dull and groſſe, and ſlow in all they do; but, as the bigger the Naile is the greater weight it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and is harder to be pulled out, ſo the more groſſe we are in our affections, the longer do they ſtay in our ſouls So as if you have ſeen me the Servant of this fair Shepheardeſs, very likely you ſhall ſee me ſo again; for, we do not uſe to change every time we ſleep; but, if you uſe to do ſo, who have a hot brain, as the baldneſſe of your head, and curling of your hair doth ſhew, you muſt not judge of us, by your own more nimble and ſtirring inclination. <hi>Hylas</hi> hearing this Shepheard's freedome of language, and ſo pat to his own humour, did think, that either <hi>Tircis</hi> had told him ſomething, or elſe, that he had known him formerly: And therefore, Shepheard, ſaid he, have you heretofore ſeen me, or do you ſpeak this of me by heareſay? I did never ſee you before, ſaid <hi>Silvander;</hi> but your phyſiognomie and diſcourſe does prompt me unto what I ſay: For, one ſhall hardly ſuſpect another of that fault, whereof themſelves are clear. Therefore, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> you cannot be exempt from unconſtancy, ſince you do ſuſpect me. Suſpition, replied <hi>Silvander,</hi> proceeds either from ſome little appearance, or from no appearance but our own imagination: but, what I ſay of you is not upon any ſuſpition, but upon a certain aſſurance. Do you call it ſuſpition, when I heard you ſay that you once loved <hi>Laonice,</hi> and then quitted her for another, that other for a third, and that third for <hi>Phillis,</hi> who doubtleſſe you will quit upon the firſt ſight of any new commer? <hi>Tircis</hi> hearing this diſcourſe, and ſeeing <hi>Hylas</hi> at a non-plus, began to fall thus upon him: <hi>Hylas</hi> ſaid he, you are now plainly diſcovered, and it boots you not to conceal your ſelfe any longer; the diſcerning eyes of this Shepheard can find out your inconſtancy; and therefore your beſt way is, to confeſſe the truth, againſt which, if you contend, you will finde, that ſhe will prove you a lyar, and ſo you will quite loſe your reputation: Confeſſe it therefore freely and to encourage you, I will break the Ice and begin; Know, generous Shepheard, that this <hi>Hylas</hi> is the moſt inconſtant, the moſt diſloyall, and the moſt perfidious Shepheard that ever promiſed affection. Then added <hi>Phillis</hi> He does much oblige thoſe whom he does not love. What Miſtreſſe, anſwered <hi>Hylas,</hi> will you be alſo againſt me? Can you give any credit to the impoſtures of this malitious man? Do you not ſee, that <hi>Tircis,</hi> thinking himſelfe obliged unto <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander,</hi> for the ſentence which he gave on his ſide, does think to repay it back, by infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an ill opinion of me into you? What does that argue, (ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi> unto <hi>Silvander)?</hi> What does it argue, ſaid the inconſtant Shepheard? do you not know, that it is a greater difficulty to take a place which is already poſſeſſed, than one which is not taken up by any? His meaning is, added <hi>Silvander,</hi> that as long as you love him, it will be hard for me to get into your favour. But, my friend <hi>Hylas,</hi> I believe you are much miſtaken; for, though I ſee, ſhe daignes to caſt her eye a little upon you, yet, am I very confident of her amitie; for, out of a ſound judgment I do know, that ſhe will alwaies make choice of the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53526:61"/>
better. To which <hi>Hylas</hi> anſwered, Perhaps you think, vain-glorious Shepheard, that you have ſome advantage of me; but, I pray, where does it lye? none can ſee it, nor does my Miſtreſſe believe it. What kinde of a ſilly thing is he, that never had the courage or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, to love and ſerve above one Miſtreſſe? and that too, ſo faintly and ſimply, as you would ſwear he mocked her: whereas I, that have loved as many Beauties as I have ſeen, I have been bid welcome by them all. What pittifull ſervice is to be expected from him, that knowes not where to begin? But I, that have courted and ſerved all ſorts, of all ages, conditions and humours, I can turn, and winde, and do any thing to pleaſe or diſpleaſe: And, for a proof of what I ſay, I pray give me leave to catechiſe him a little, that you may ſee his ſillineſſe. Then turning towards <hi>Silvander,</hi> he asked him, what that was, which would moſt oblige a fair Shepheardeſſe to love? It is, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> to love only her. And what is it, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> which will moſt pleaſe her? It is, anſwered <hi>Silvander,</hi> to love her extreamly. Do you ſee (ſaid <hi>Hylas)</hi> what a ſimplician this is: Why, this is the way together ſcorn and hatred; for, to love her only gives her an occaſion to think, that it is for want of courage that you dare not attempt to love any elſe, and therefore ſhe will ſcorn ſuch a faint hearted Lover: whereas, did you love all you look upon, ſhe would not think you come to her, becauſe you knew not whither to go elſe; but, ſhe will then priſe you the higher, and will be obliged to love you, eſpecially, if you particularize her above any other, and tell her ſome ſtories which you have gleaned from others; then, once a week come and profeſſe your ſervice, or may be oftner, if a good occaſion require, this will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you more pleaſing, and invite her to cheriſh your company. This is the way, fond No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to oblige her unto love; but, to pule and pleaſe her continually, is the only way to make her look aſquint at you: Nothing is ſo tiring and tedious, as theſe huge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream affections; ſuch as love, ſo, muſt needs be perpetually impriſoned, never at liberty, alwaies preſent, continually talking to her; ſhe cannot ſtir a foot but you muſt do the like. To be briefe, you are abominably troubleſome to her. But, the Devill of all is, if ſhe chance to be at any time ill, and do not ſmile upon you, nor pleaſe you forſooth, then muſt you put the finger to eye and cry; cry tears, inſomuch as you force her to flie you. Do you think this to be the way to make her love you: No, no, it is in Love as in all things elſe, the Mean is the beſt Meaſure; ſo as to avoid all theſe frivolous follies, the only way is to love but indifferently; and the beſt way to pleaſe her, is to be pleaſant, merry, and jocund; and, above all, never to be mute before her. This, <hi>Silvander,</hi> is the way to make a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe love you, and to get her favour. And you, faireſt Miſtraſſe, may by this ſee how to value my affection. She would have anſwered, but <hi>Silvander</hi> beſeeched her to give him leave to ſpeak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And then he did examine <hi>Hylas</hi> upon theſe Interrogatories. What is it, Shepheard, that you deſire moſt when you do love? To be loved again, anſwered <hi>Hylas.</hi> But when you are loved, replied <hi>Silvander,</hi> what do you deſire or expect from this ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? that the perſon whom I love, anſwered <hi>Hylas,</hi> do prize me above all others, that ſhe truſt me, and endeavour to pleaſe me. Do you uſe poyſon to preſerve your life, ſaid <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander?</hi> how can you ever expect ſhe ſhould truſt you, when you are not faithfull unto her? Oh, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſhe ſhall never know it. Then I ſee, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> that you will do that by treachery, which ought to be done with ſincerity: As long as ſhe does not know that you love another, ſhe thinks you faithfull, and ſo you ſhrond your ſelfe under this falſe ſhadow: You talk of ſcorn, can any thing provoke a generous ſpirit more unto it, than to imagine, that this man whom I ſee ſo ſubmiſſe at your feet, adoring you, ſhould have his lips bliſtered with the kiſſes of others; and thoſe eyes which ſeem to adore you, ready to ſparkle love at every woman they look upon? What ſhould any woman of any Soul, have any thing to do with a thing common? He will do no more for you, than he will for any one that has the reſemblance of a woman; when he ſpeaks to you, his minde is a hundred Leagues off, and is thinking of ſuch a one, that a thouſand to one is ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand degrees your inferiour; the words he makes uſe of are ſome fragments gleaned from another, ſuch as his heart never ownes: Oh! how horrid a ſcorn deſerves ſuch a man! As to the next point, which he urged to obtain love by, which is, To be jolly, and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liard, and alwaies laughing: Truly, that is a principall quality for a Buffon, or one that has nothing at his heart; but, for a Lover to be of that temper, is abſurd, unleſſe, <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſuch a Lover as your ſelfe. Again, you ſay that a mean in Love is the beſt; but let me tell you, that he who is but halfe faithfull, is not faithfull at all; and he that loves not in the higheſt point of extremity, does not love one jot, he who can be indifferent, and love all alike, cannot love one as he ought to do. Valourand Love are reſemblant, and he that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53526:62"/>
can meaſure them, or thinks any greater than his own, is neither valiant, nor a lover worth a Ruſh. So, <hi>Hylas,</hi> you ſee, that to injoyn a mediocrity in Love, is to impoſe an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility: And when you love ſo, you do as thoſe melancholly fools do, that think they are expert in all Sciences, and know nothing: 'Tis juſt your caſe, in thinking you love, when you doe not. But be it ſo, that one can love a little; Do you not know, that Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath no other Harveſt but Amity, and all that is ſowed, is onely to reap ſome fruit? How can you, that ſow but a little, ever expect to reap much? Ah, <hi>Hylas,</hi> you little know what belongs to Love: For thoſe effects which belong to an extream love, and which you call Troubles, are ſo indeed, to ſuch as you, who know not how to love; but ſuch as are really, and in good earneſt in love, and know what ſacrifices and duties belong unto the Altars of Love, they are ſo far from calling thoſe effects, troubles, as they think them feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, and perfect contentments. But, <hi>Hylas,</hi> I will tell you what it is to love; It is to dye in ones ſelf, that he may live in another: Never to love any thing but what is pleaſing and agreeable unto the party loved. The will muſt be abſolutely transformed into a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris: And can you think, that one who loves thus, will ever be troubled with the preſence of her whom he loves? The knowledge ſhe hath of being loved, is a thing ſo infinitely pleaſing, as all things elſe in compariſon of that, have no reliſh. And if you do but know what it is to love, you will never think that he who loves, can do any thing to diſpleaſe. All his actions are marked with the ſweet character of love, and cannot be diſpleaſing. If he chance to commit any fault the fault it ſelf pleaſeth, conſidering with what intention it was committed. The very deſire of being amiable has ſuch vigour in a right Lover, as though he cannot chuſe but be rough to all the world in general, yet will he be ſure to ſmooth and ſpruce up himſelf towards her he loves. And from hence is the reaſon, that many, who are not at all relliſhed by moſt in general, are yet loved and eſteemed by ſome one in particular.</p>
               <p>Do you ſee, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that hitherto you have been ignorant in the Laws of Love, and have only abuſed the Name of it, and deceived thoſe whom you thought you had loved? How, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> Have I not loved all this while? What then have I done unto <hi>Carles, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muranthe, Laonice,</hi> and a hundred more? You muſt know, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> that in all ſorts of Arts, there are both good and bad proficients in them: And ſo in Love; for ſome do love well as I do, and ſome ill as you: So as I may be termed the Maſter, and you the Changling of Love.</p>
               <p>At this every one ſmiled, except <hi>Lycidas,</hi> who hearing all this diſcourſe grew higher in his jealous apprehenſions, which <hi>Phillis</hi> did not obſerve, thinking it rather an effect of his affection to her, ſince in reaſon he could never doubt her. One that is ignorant, and knows not that Jealouſie in Love is a ſucker which draws unto it ſelf that nutriment which ſhould go into the branches and good fruit, does not know that the greater it is, the more doth it argue the kindneſs of the place, and vigour of the plant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paris,</hi> who admired the neat wit of <hi>Silvander,</hi> did not know how to judge of him, but thought, that were he more converſant amongſt civilized people, he would be unparaleld; ſince living amongſt Shepheards, he was ſuch as he found him: And therefore he reſolved to contract friendſhip with him, to the end he might more freely enjoy his company; and to make them proceed in their diſputation, he addreſſed himſelf unto <hi>Hylas,</hi> and ſaid unto him, It ſeems, <hi>Hylas,</hi> your cauſe is naught, ſince you are ſo mute, and has not a word more to ſay in the defence of it. No wonder, ſaid <hi>Diana;</hi> for I beleeve he is pricked in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Hylas</hi> knowing that he argued all this while againſt the truth, &amp; only to put a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom gloſs upon his fault, he would not reply a word, but looked very attentively upon <hi>Phillis,</hi> who was got near unto <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and talked with him in a low voice; and becauſe <hi>Aſtrea</hi> would not have him hear what ſhe ſaid, ſhe did often interrupt him, and ſo often, as ſhe forced him to ſay, that if <hi>Phillis</hi> were as troubleſom as ſhe was, he ſhould not love her. Truly Shepheard, ſaid ſhe, purpoſely to keep him from hearing, If you ſhould be as uncivil to her, as you are to us, ſhe will make no great accompt of you. And becauſe <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> never heeding this talk, continued on her diſcourſe, <hi>Diana</hi> ſaid unto her, what <hi>Phillis</hi> is this all the duty you will pay unto me? Will you let me go, and entertain a Shepheard in diſcourſe? To which <hi>Phillis</hi> upon a ſudden anſwered, No, no, I beſeech you, Miſtris, but pardon my error; for I thought that the jolly diſcourſe of <hi>Hylas</hi> would have kept you from taking any notice of me, who in the mean time, was talking of a buſineſs which this Shepheard deſired ſome ſatisfaction in. And indeed, ſhe ſpoke but truth; for ſhe was much troubled at the faint and cold behaviour of <hi>Lycidas.</hi> Well, well <hi>Phillis</hi> (anſwered
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53526:62"/>
                  <hi>Diana,</hi> in the language of a real Miſtris) you alwaies think to cover your faults with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes; but pray take notice, that theſe frequent negligences are ſo many teſtimonies of your ſmall affection, and that when time and place ſerves, I ſhall remember how you uſe me. <hi>Hylas</hi> had the hand of <hi>Phillis</hi> in his, and not knowing how things were betwixt <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and her, he wondered to hear <hi>Diana</hi> ſay ſo; and therefore ſeeing her ready to begin an excuſe, he interrupted her, ſaying, What does my faireſt Miſtris ſay unto this imperious Shepheardeſs who treats you in ſuch coorſe language? Will you yeeld unto her in any thing? Commit no ſuch ſin, I beſeech you; for though ſhe be indeed fair, yet you have beauty enough to make your party good enough with her, if not excell her. Oh <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> did you but know againſt whom you uſe this language, you would rather bee dumb all your daies, than diſpleaſe this fair Shepheardeſs who, did you love her, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the leaſt glimpſe of her eye to make you the moſt wretched thing that ever loved. Make me ſo, ſaid the Shepheard; No, no, ſhe may doe what ſhe will with her eyes, open or ſhut them, and never hurt me; my miſery or happineſs depends not upon her flames, neither in her eyes, face, nor any part elſe, but I doe love you, and more than that, inſpite of her will love you. If you do love me, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> and I have any power of you, then ſurely ſhe hath much more. I may be moved by your affection and ſervices not to treat you ill: But this fair Shepheardeſs having no ſervices or love from you, will have no pitty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you. What have I to doe with her pitty? ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> am I at her mercy? Yes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> you are at her mercy; for my will is her will, and I can doe nothing but what ſhe is pleaſed to command. She is the Miſtris whom I do love, ſerve, and adore. So as ſhe; and ſhe onely is all my affection, all my ſervice, and all my devotion. See there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Hylas,</hi> how you have offended her, and what mercy and pardon you ſtand in need of. Then <hi>Hylas,</hi> throwing himſelf at <hi>Diana</hi>'s feet, after a little time of conſideration, thus ſaid unto her: Fair Miſtris ormine, if he that loves could have eyes to ſee any thing but the thing loved, certainly, I had ſeen that it is the duty of every one to honour and reverence your merits. But ſince my eyes were ſhut againſt all but my fair <hi>Phillis,</hi> I ſhall think you too full of cruelty, if you doe not pardon a crime, which I confeſs, and beg a mercy for. <hi>Phillis,</hi> who had a mind to be rid of this man, that ſhe might talk unto <hi>Lyci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> did interrupt <hi>Diana</hi> in her anſwer, and told him, that <hi>Diana</hi> would not pardon him, unleſs upon condition to relate all his Courtſhips and Adventures which he had ever ſince he firſt loved: For it was impoſſible but that diſcourſe ſhould be very delightful, ſince he had ſuch variety of Miſtreſſes. Certainly <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> you can divine my thoughts; for I did intend not to pardon, but upon the ſame condition: And therefore <hi>Hylas,</hi> if you expect any mercy from me, reſolve upon it. How, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> will you force me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a Rock, as may chance to ſplit me; and conſtrain me to relate the ſtory of my life before my Miſtris? What opinion will ſhe have of me when ſhe hears, that I have had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a hundred; ſome of one complexion and humour, and ſome of another; what will ſhe think of me? No worſe than ſhe does, anſwered <hi>Silvander;</hi> for ſhe knows you to be an extravagant peece, and light as the wind. 'Tis very true, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> but becauſe I will not ſpoyl any ſport, I ſhall deſire that I may go about ſome buſineſs which I have with
<hi>Aſtrea,</hi> whilſt <hi>Hylas</hi> is obeying the commands of <hi>Diana.</hi> So upon this ſhe took <hi>Aſtrea</hi> by the Arm, and did lead her to the ſide of the Wood, where <hi>Lycidas</hi> was gone before; and becauſe <hi>Silvander</hi> over-heard her anſwer, he followed at a diſtance to ſee what his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was, and the evening was very favourable to him; for it began to be dark, ſo as hee might follow unſeen, and ſtole from tree to tree ſo near them, as he heard <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Phillis,</hi> what ſtrange humour is this in <hi>Lycidas,</hi> that he ſhould deſire to ſpeak with you at ſuch a time, in ſuch a place as this? I cannot tell, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> but he hath been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſad all this evening, and conjured me to come hither; let me entreat you to walk here a little whilſt we are together: But it was his ſpecial charge that I ſhould be alone. I ſhall do what you pleaſe, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> but take heed that he be not more diſpleaſed at you for meeting him at ſuch undue hours, and alone in ſuch a dark place. Upon that conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> I do entreat you to take the pains of comming hither: And, I beſeech you, walk ſo near us, that if any chance to come, he may think we are all three to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>Whilſt they were talking thus, <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> preſſed <hi>Hylas</hi> to relate the ſtory of his life, and obey the commands of his Miſtris: And though he ſeemed to be very unwilling, yet at laſt he began thus.</p>

                  <hi>The Hiſtory of</hi> Hylas.</head>
               <p>WILL you needs have it ſo, fair Miſtris of my Miſtris, and you noble <hi>Paris,</hi> that I muſt tell all my fortune ever ſince I began firſt to Love? I pray doe not think that the refuſal which I made, was becauſe I had nothing to ſay: For, beleeve me, I have loved too many to want ſubject; but it was becauſe me-thinks we want day. I doe not mean to tell you all, but to tell you one of my Adventures; for all would require a little Age before the ſtory would be ended. Yet in obedience to your commands, I will begin, and beſeech you to conſider, that every one is ſubject unto ſome ſuperiour Power, againſt which there is no reſiſtance: That predominate Power unto which I am ſo violently devoted, is Love: otherwiſe perhaps you will wonder, that there ſhould be no chain, either of duty or obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation ſtrong enough to hold me. I muſt freely confeſs, that as every one has a natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, that mine is unto Inconſtancy, for which I ought not to be blamed, ſince it is the decree of Heaven upon me. Amongſt all the fine Scituations which the River <hi>Roſne</hi> doth in his impetuous courſe viſit, after it hath taken in <hi>Arar, Iſeres, Durance,</hi> and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rivers, it daſheth it ſelf againſt the old walls of the Town of <hi>Arles,</hi> the Metropolis of its Country, the beſt peopled, and richeſt of all the Roman Provinces: Near unto this good Town did encamp (as I have heard our <hi>Druides</hi> ſay) the great Commander, called <hi>Caius Marius,</hi> a little before that ſignal Victory which he obtained againſt the <hi>Cimbres,</hi> the <hi>Cimmerians,</hi> and the <hi>Celts,</hi> at the foot of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> who being gone through the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thique</hi> Ocean with intentions to ſack <hi>Rome,</hi> were ſo defeated by this great Captain, that not one of them came off with life: And if the Roman Arms did ſpare any, the barbarous fury of their courage did turn their own hands againſt themſelves, and being aſhamed to live, killed one another. Then, the Roman Army, for the ſecurity of their Allies and Friends, came to encamp before this Town; and according to the cuſtome of that Nation, did circle about their Camp with a moſt profound and deep Trench, which extended to the very banks of <hi>Roſne,</hi> whoſe impetuous ſource was ſuch, as entring into thoſe Trenches, did divide its chanel into two wales: The ancient River ran its old courſe, and the new had ſuch a paſs by theſe Trenches, as did equal the greateſt Rivers, and made a moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant &amp; fertile Iſland between them: And becauſe of the Trenches of <hi>Caius Marius,</hi> the people call it corruptively, <hi>Carmargue;</hi> and theſe two Armes of <hi>Roſne</hi> running into the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean Sea, they call the Iſle between them <hi>Camargue.</hi> I ſhould not have derived the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree of this place ſo high, had it not been the place which gave me birth, and where my Anceſtors have long continued: Where by reaſon of the places abundant fertility, many Shepheards reſort; and my Predeceſſors ever held a conſiderable rank amongſt them; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes eſteemed both rich and virtuous; and when they dyed, left me enough to live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and indeed too ſoon for me did my Father dye, ſince it was the very ſame day that I was born; and my Mother, who had the education of me, did doat upon me as her only child, or rather ſpoyled me. Judge what a fine Maſter of a houſe I was: Amongſt the reſt of my young imperfections, I could not avoyd that of Pride, thinking that all the Shepheards in <hi>Camargue</hi> ought of duty to reverence me: And when I was grown to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per years, I thought every Shepheardeſs was in love with me, and that any of them would bee beholding to me for my affection. I was moſt fortified in that opinion by a fair and wiſe Shepheardeſs, my neighbour, called <hi>Carlis,</hi> who carreſſed me extreamly. I was yet ſo young, that the pangs of Love could not much torment me, ſo as I did onely reſent the ſweetneſs of her favours, and that was all. My age did not permit me to know whether or no it was Love; but however I was infinitely pleaſed in the company of this Shephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs, and uſed ſuch courtſhip as they doe who are in love: So as this continual practice made many think that I knew more than my age permitted: And therefore when I arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at eighteen or nineteen years of age, I found my ſelf deeply engaged to ſerve her: But ſince I never affected that vainglorious humour which moſt Lovers uſe to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to themſelves, which is, to be reputed conſtant; the kind treatment of <hi>Carlis</hi> obliged mee much more than that imaginary duty. And therefore, one of my chiefeſt and familiarieſt friends took an occaſion to divert mee from her; his name was <hi>Hermantes,</hi> who, ere I was well aware, was ſo deeply and deſperately in love with <hi>Carlis,</hi> that hee had no felicity or contentment, but in being near her. I being but a Novice in Love, never perceived this new affection, nor had I ſubtlety e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53526:63"/>
to finde it out: He was ſomething older then I, and conſequently more cunning, and knew ſo well how to diſſemble, as I did not think any ſuſpected ſuch a thing: But, his greateſt trouble was, that the Parents of this Shepheardeſſe deſired this match betwixt her and I ſhould proceed, becauſe they thought it advantageous to her, of which, <hi>Hermantes</hi> being advertiſed, and finding, by his diſcourſe with the Shepheardeſſe, that ſhe did love me, he conceived, that ſhe would fall off from me, if he could procure me to fall off from here He knew well enough, that I would change aſſoon as a good occaſion offered it ſelfe; and after he had well conſidered with himſelf how he ſhould begin his deſigne, he thought, that if he could infuſe an opinion into me, that I deſerved a better match, I ſhould eaſily diſdain her And indeed, he found that no great piece of difficulty; for firſt, I had a very good opinion of him as my deareſt friend; and next I had a conceit, that there was nere a Shepheardeſſe in all <hi>Camargue,</hi> but would be glad to entertain me. Upon theſe grounds, I diſpoſſeſſed <hi>Carlis</hi> from any ſhare in my thoughts, and made choiſe of one whom I thought more deſerving: and doubtleſſe I was not miſtaken, for ſhe was one that had beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enough to make one love her, and prudence enough to behave herſelfe, her name was <hi>Still ana,</hi> eſteemed to be the faireſt and wiſeſt in all the Iſle, and ſuch a one as did draw me out of my former error. But, ſee the fondneſſe of my proud fancy, becauſe ſhe had been courted by very many, and all of them baſtled, I did the more willingly fall on, to the end my merits might be the more noted. <hi>Carlis,</hi> who did really love me, wondred at the alteration, not knowing what occaſion I could have for it; but to reduce me to her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, ſhe began to caſt about, and uſe all manner of allurements ſhe could deviſe; yet, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now upon the main Ocean, could not think upon any landing ſo ſoon. But, though ſhe was much diſpleaſed at this ſeparation; yet, ſhe was ſhortly after revenged, by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame that cauſed her miſery. For, imagining with myſelfe, that aſſoon as I gave <hi>Stillia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> any aſſurance of my love, ſhe would freely reſigne herſelfe unto me; therefore the firſt time that I met her at a dancing meeting, I ſaid thus unto her as we danced together; Faireſt Shepheardeſſe, I cannot tell what power it is which you have, nor what kinde of charmes they are which ſparkle from your fair eyes: but, I am ſure <hi>Hylas</hi> is ſo much your ſervant, that no mortall can be more. She thought I mock'd her, knowing how I loved <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> and therefore in a ſmiling manner, anſwered thus: Is this the language, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that you learned in the School of <hi>Carlis?</hi> I would have anſwered, when by the order of the Ball we parted, ſo as I was conſtrained to ſtay till the aſſembly parted; then ſeeing her go out the firſt, I ſtepped to her and took her by the hand At the firſt ſhe ſmiled, afterwards ſaid thus unto me, Is it, <hi>Hylas,</hi> out of reſolution, or out of command, that you apply your ſelfe this night unto me? I beſeech you, ſaid I, why do you ask that queſtion? Becauſe, ſaid ſhe I ſee ſo little reaſon for it, as I muſt needs think it one of theſe occaſions. It is, ſaid I, out of a reſolution never to love any but the fair <hi>Stilliana,</hi> and your beauty commands me never to love any other. I believe, anſwered ſhe, that you are miſtaken, and does not think you ſpeak unto me, or elſe you do not know me but, not to let you run on any longer in your error know, that I am not <hi>Carlis,</hi> but my name is <hi>Stilliana.</hi> He muſt be blinde, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered I, that takes you for <hi>Carlis,</hi> ſhe comes infinitely too much ſhort of you, to take her for you, or you for her: But I do know, too well for my liberty, that you are <hi>Stilliana;</hi> and it would be more my tranquillity if I knew it leſſe. Thus I talked her to her lodging, not knowing whether I was welcome to her or no. It was no ſooner day the next morning, then I went unto <hi>Hermantes,</hi> to tell him the paſſage of the laſt night. I found him in Bed; and perceiving me to be netled at ſomething, Well, ſaid he, what newes? is the victory gotten before the combat? Ah friend, ſaid I, I have been pittifully bafled, ſhe diſdaines me mocks me, and at every word ſends me to <hi>Carlis</hi> ſhe will treat me as a cruell Miſtreſſe, and laughs at me. But <hi>Hermantes</hi> knowing my fleeting diſpoſition, and fearing that indeed I would return to <hi>Carlis,</hi> alſo that ſhe would entertain me, he anſwered me thus, Why, friend, did you ever expect any leſſe from her? would you eſteem her worthy of your love, if ſhe give herſelfe unto you, before ſhe knowes whether you do really love her? How could ſhe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, at the very firſt, give any credit to you, ſince all the Iſle knowes, you heretofore loved <hi>Carlis?</hi> Certainly, ſhe were very eaſily vanquiſhed, if ſo ſmall an attempt ſhould win her. But friend, ſaid I unto him, is it not firſt requiſite I acquaint her with my ſlighting of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> before I do declare my love unto her? It ſeemes, anſwered <hi>Hermantes,</hi> that you are ignorant in Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I muſt tell you, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that when a declaration of Love is made unto a Shepheardeſſe, ſhe never well believes it at the firſt, becauſe it is the common cuſtome and garb of all Shepheards, to be courteous and civill, and the weakneſſe of their Sex, does
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53526:64"/>
oblige men to ſerve and honour them in generall. On the contrary, upon the leaſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of any hatred, they do eaſily think themſelves to be hated; becauſe amitie is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and enmity the contrary. From hence I argue, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that it is much more eaſie to make <hi>Carlis</hi> believe you hate her, than to perſwade <hi>Stilliana,</hi> that you love her. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you finde, that your affection unto <hi>Carlis</hi> does ſtick upon her ſtomack, your beſt way is, to make her know that you do not love this <hi>Carlis,</hi> which you muſt do by ſome action, made known, not only unto <hi>Carlis,</hi> but unto <hi>Stilliana</hi> and many others. To be briefe, fair Shepheardeſſe, he knew ſo well how to turn me any way he pleaſed, that I writ this Letter unto the poor <hi>Carlis.</hi>

               <p>This Letter, I muſt confeſſe, did a little nettle me; for, my Conſcience told me, I had wronged this Shepheardeſſe; but my new affection unto <hi>Stilliana</hi> would not let me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, but did prompt me to lay the fault upon her; for, ſaid I to my ſelfe, Since ſhe is neither ſo fair nor pleaſing as <hi>Stilliana,</hi> why ſhould I any longer love her?

Upon theſe motives, I endeavoured to drive <hi>Carlis</hi> from my heart; and thinking, that now I had nothing to do but to court <hi>Stilliana,</hi> whom I thought already mine; I deſired <hi>Hermantes</hi> to carry a Letter from me to her, and alſo to ſhew her a Copy of that I writ unto <hi>Carlis,</hi> to the end, ſhe might not queſtion my love to her. <hi>Hermantes</hi> being truly my reall friend, in any thing which related not unto <hi>Carlis,</hi> did, without any difficulty, take it upon him, and chuſing a convenient time when ſhe was alone in her lodging, preſented my Letters unto her, and ſmilingly ſaid thus: Fair <hi>Stilliana,</hi> if the fire do burn him that ſhall approach too neer it, if the Sun do dazzle that eye, which dares look upon its luſtre, and if the Sword do wound him that thruſts it to his heart, you muſt

not wonder, if the miſerable <hi>Hylas,</hi> comming too neer you, be ſcorched; if, in beholding you, he be dazled; and if, in receiving the fatall dart of your fair eyes, he reſent the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall wound in his heart. He would have gone on had not ſhe, in a furious impatiency, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted him: No more, no more, good <hi>Hermantes,</hi> (ſaid ſhe) you trouble your ſelfe in vain; <hi>Hylas</hi> has neither merit enough, nor you eloquence ſufficient, to perſwade me unto any minde of changing my contentment for his; nor do I wiſh my ſelfe ſo much ill, nor <hi>Hylas</hi> ſo much good, as to believe your words: 'Tis well, <hi>Hermantes,</hi> that I am acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the humour of <hi>Hylas,</hi> at the coſt of another, and not mine own; it is too much that <hi>Carlis</hi> hath been ſo baſely deluded by him, and let him not make you inſtrumentall in the ruine of another: As you do love <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſo I do love <hi>Stilliana;</hi> and if you will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe him as a friend, counſell him as I do, never to love <hi>Stilliana,</hi> nor <hi>Stilliana</hi> to love <hi>Hylas,</hi> and if he will not believe you aſſure him, that all his labour will be loſt: And as for this Letter which you bring me from him, I care not if I do take it, for I am ſo well armed againſt him, that I do not fear his charmes. Upon this, ſhe opened the Letter, and read it aloud: It was only an aſſurance of my affection, that I had quitted <hi>Carlis</hi> for her ſake, and an earneſt imploring her to love me. When ſhe had read it, ſhe ſmiled, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning towards <hi>Hermantes,</hi> asked him, whether he would have her return an Anſwer; and he anſwering, that he did paſſionately deſire it; ſhe ſaid, ſhe would; and did, in theſe Termes.</p>

                  <hi>Hermantes</hi> had not ſeen this Letter, when he gave it unto me: and though he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that it would prove, ſome cold and faint deniall: Yet he did not think ſhe would have been ſo ſharp: but he did not wonder at it, ſo much as my ſelfe: for I was almoſt ſtark mad tearing the Letter in peeces, and throwing it upon the ground: then recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelfe a little, I pulled my hat over my browes, looked upon the ground, croſſed my armes over my breaſt, and walked in the chamber without ſpeaking a word unto <hi>Herman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi> He ſtood all the while like a ſtock, and ſtill fixed his eyes upon me. Thus did we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue mute a long while at laſt, I clapped my hands together upon a ſudden &amp; leaped into the middle of the room. The Devill take her, ſaid I aloud, let him love her that will for me, there are Shepheards enough in <hi>Camargue</hi> as fair as ſhe, that will be glad <hi>Hylas</hi> would Love them. Afterwards, addreſſing my ſelfe unto <hi>Hermantes.</hi> Oh what a foole <hi>Stilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> is, (ſaid I unto him) if ſhe think that I will Love her by force? Why ſhould I be ſo ſilly as ever to think any more upon her? Does ſhe think there are none to love but ſhe? I am ſure, <hi>Hermantes,</hi> ſhe twinkled with her eyes, and bit her lipps when ſhe talked with you: but I cannot chuſe but laugh at her ſimplicity, if ſhe think I care for her more then I do for the veryeſt ſtranger in all <hi>Gaule:</hi> She muſt needs twit me with <hi>Carlis;</hi> yes, I did love her; and wil love her again in ſpite of a thouſand <hi>Stillianas,</hi> and I am confident that ere long ſhe will repent of her fillineſſe: but its no matter, let her repent her heart out for <hi>Hylas;</hi> he will be hanged before he ever love her again As I uſed theſe expreſſions I obſerved that <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantes</hi> changed colour; but then I was ignorant of the cauſe not imagining that it proceeded from his fears of my reingratiating my ſelf into the favour of his Miſtriſs but however he laughed it out, &amp; ſaid that he wondered at this alteration.

She who was highly offended as you may

think, after a patient hearing, gave me this anſwer. <hi>Hylas,</hi> if theſe aſſurances of your good will to me were true, I ſhould be ſatisfied: but if they be only lyes, never think I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue with you, ſince I do find ſo much dainger in your humour: ſhe would have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, if <hi>Stilliana</hi> had not come to ſhew her the Letter I had writen, and to viſit her. When ſhe ſaw me with <hi>Carlis,</hi> Do I wake or do I dream? ſaid ſhe in a great amaze Is this <hi>Hylas</hi> that I ſee, or is it a Spirit? <hi>Carlis</hi> being very glad of this encounter, thus anſwered; Yes yes dear companion it is <hi>Hylas,</hi> you are not miſtaken; and if you pleaſe to come a little nearer, you may heare in what quaint Language he cryes me mercy, and how he repents of all he writ unto me, ſubmitting himſelfe unto what puniſhment I ſhall inflict upon him. Let his puniſhment be, ſaid <hi>Stilliana,</hi> to continue in his affection unto me. To you? ſaid <hi>Carlis,</hi> why he ſwore unto me, juſt as you entered, that he loved only me I am ſure, ſaid <hi>Stilliana,</hi> that <hi>Hermantes</hi> brought a Letter to me from him within this two houres. and to put all out of doubt, I pray read this, and ſee whether or no I lie. I proteſt, Fair Shepheardeſſe, I was not able to open my mouth, or ſpeak one ſyllable in my own defence And to daſh me the more out of countenance, many other Shepheardeſſes came in, at the ſame time, who were all witneſſes againſt me, ſo as I was not able to tarry any longer: but ſlinking away without giving a ſyllable to any, I went unto <hi>Hermantes,</hi> and acquainted him with my adventure, who laughed as long as he could, as the ſubject did very well deſerve. The noiſe of this was ſo ſpread throughout all <hi>Camarque,</hi> that I could not open my lips unto any Shepheardeſſe, who did not hit me in the teeth with it of which I was ſo much aſhamed that I reſolved to quit the iſle for a certain time. You may ſee, I was but young when I was aſhamed to be called the Inconſtant Lover: ſurely at this age I ſhould not move a foot for any ſuch-reproaches: you ſee (ſaid <hi>Paris)</hi> that one muſt be an appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice before he be a Maſter; tis very true, anſwered <hi>Hylas,</hi> and the worſt is, he often payes for his apprentiſhip. But to returne to our diſcourſe. I not being able any longer to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the perpetuall clamours againſt me, I gave order for my houſhold as ſecretly as I could, and referred the managment of it wholly unto <hi>Hermantes,</hi> and afterwards took boat amongſt many others. I had then no other deſign but to travell, and paſſeway the time, not caring any more for either <hi>Carlis</hi> or <hi>Stilliana,</hi> then if I had never ſeen them for I had ſo loſt the memorie of them, in loſing the ſight of them, as I never gave one ſigh for them both. But ſee how difficult a thing it is to turne the tide of ones inclination I had no ſooner ſet my foot in the Boat, but I ſaw a new ſubject for my Love. There was amongſt other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingers, one old woman who was going unto <hi>Lions,</hi> to pay ſome vowes unto the Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> which ſhe had made for her Son: and brought along with her, her fair Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the ſame occaſion and with reaſon had ſhe the name of Fair, ſince ſhe equalled <hi>Stilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> and tranſcended <hi>Carlis:</hi> her name was <hi>Aymea,</hi> who in age could not be above ninteen or twenty: and though <hi>Camargue</hi> was her Country, yet ſhe did not know me, becauſe her jealous Husband (as commonly all old men are that have young and fair wives) did keep her in ſo cloſe, as ſhe never came into our publique aſſemblies. As ſoon as ever I ſaw her, ſhe pleaſedme, and do what I could, muſt needs love her. But I ſureſaw it would be trouble enough unto me to delude the Stepmother, and win the Stepdaughter. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, not to ſtick at any difficulties. I ſummoned all the wit I had to my ayd; and conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beſt way would be to begin by the Mother, I thought it moſt expedient to make my ſelf knowne unto her, and that ſome old love between our families, or ſomeoutient alliande or other, would beget me ſome familiarity with her: and I was not deceived in this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For as ſoon as I told her who I was, and had given her ſome ſeurvy excuſe or other for my being diſguiſed, which ſhe took for good; alſo aſſured her, that I would never have diſcovered my ſelfe unto her, but only that ſhe might the more freely accept of my ſervice: My Son, anſwered ſhe, I do not wonder at your good will to me for your father did love me ſo well, as you ſhould have degenerated too much, if you had not ſome ſparkes of that affection remaining in you: Oh my dear Child, you are Son unto a man that was the richeſt and moſt amiable man in all <hi>Camargue:</hi> As ſhe ſpoke theſe words, ſhe took my head and cloſed it to her breaſt, and kiſſed my forehead and her kiſſe did put me in memorie of a chimney which yet retaines a little heat, after all the fire is taken away: for my Father, though he miſſed marrying her, yet ſerved her too much for her reputation, as as I have heard ſince: but I, who cared not a ruſh for all her carreſſes, further then they conduced to my deſigne, ſeemed to receive them with much obligation, and thanked her for her affection to my Father, beſeeching her to let it deſcend upon his Son: and ſince the heavens had made me heire unto all his eſtate, I hope ſhe would not diſinherit me of that which I eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53526:65"/>
moſt, which was the honour of her favour and that for my part I would ſucceed my Father in all devotion and ſervice to her. To be brief, Fair Shepheardeſſe, I flattered up this old woman with ſuch candid language, that ſhe loved me, none better; and to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie me, ſhe did contrary to her cuſtom, command her Daughter in Law to Love me alſo. Oh that ſhe had been ſo well adviſed as to follow her counſell? But I never met with any ſo cold in all her actions; ſo I was ſeverall dayes with her; and never had the confidence to breake my deſigne unto her in words; for <hi>Stilliana</hi> had put me much out of conceipt of my ſelf: beſides, ſhe was alwayes at the old hagges elbow who twattled continually unto me, of old done deeds, all the day long.

As ſoon as my Shepheardeſſe was in the Iſle, ſhe went along the water ſide with other women of her age, and I thruſt my ſelfe amongſt them in hopes of an opportunity, whilſt the old Beldam was walking with ſome others of her own gang. By fortune, <hi>Aymea,</hi> being parted from her companions and was gathering flowers by the water ſide, I ſtepped to her, and took her by the hand: then after I had walked with her a little further, I began thus to expreſſe my ſelfe; I ſhould be aſhamed fair Shepheardeſſe, to be ſo long mute, did I not feare my ſpeech would more offend you, then my ſilence. I do not know <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid ſhe unto me, what occaſion you ſhould have either to be ſilent or to ſpeak: Oh Faireſt, ſaid I, my affection does ſo ſecretly burne me, and gives me ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to declare my pain, that I cannot be ſilent; on the other ſide my affection puts me in ſuch fear, of offending her I Love by declaring it unto her, that I dare not ſpeake: ſo as the ſame affection which ſhould furniſh me with words, denyes them, when I am with you: Me? (replyed ſhe preſently) pray <hi>Hylas</hi> be well adviſed what you ſay. Yes you, Faireſt, replyed I, I do very well know what I ſay. Did I think this to be in earneſt, ſaid ſhe, I ſhould anſwer you after another ſtraine: If you make any doubt of my being in earneſt, ſaid I, I beſeech you conſider your own perfections, and they will perfectly inform you. Then, with a thouſand proteſtations and oathes, I vented the whole thoughts of my heart unto her: She, without any diſmay, coldly anſwered, <hi>Hylas,</hi> never charge me with any of your follies; if you do, I ſhall know how to remedy them, and then you ſhall want a ſubject to work upon: If my Mothers affection to you, nor the condition wherein I am, will not give a check unto your injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous intentions, I aſſure you, what duty will not do in you, it ſhall in me, and I will ſo take away all occaſion from you, as you ſhall ſee, that I am what I ought to be. You ſee how calmly I ſpeak, not, but I do abominate your indiſcretion, but it is to let you ſee, that paſſion tranſports me not, but that reaſon is the rule of my tongue, and makes me ſpeak ſo mildly: And if I do finde, this moderate courſe will not divert you from your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, then will I have recourſe unto extream remedies. Theſe words uttered ſo calmly, did touch me ſo to the quick, that I knew not what to ſay; not that I intended to give over, for I knew that the firſt aſſaults are commonly thus repulſed: But, as <hi>Aymea</hi> ſaw me thus mute and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, and went away, there was one of her company, that ſeeing me muſe in that manner, came towards me, and making ſome kinde of amorous ſignes, looking at one through her fingers, ſhe paſſed by, as if ſhe did invite me to follow: At the firſt I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed not, ſeeming to take no notice but when ſhe came the ſecond time, I did: and after ſhe had made two or three turnes toward her company, ſhe ſeemed as if ſhe were out of breach, and did ſit down upon a green tuft of graſſe: I, who followed without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, ſeeing her upon the ground, and in a place where none could ſee us, began to ſport with her, and ſhe made little kinde of reſiſtance, but ſuch as ſhewed, that this privacy was not diſpleaſing unto her; for ſhe did, as I think, purpoſely uncover her neck, that the whiteneſſe of her skin might be ſeen better than could be in her face: At laſt, riſing up, ſhe ſaid unto me; I did not think, <hi>Hylas,</hi> you had been ſuch a ruffling companion, for if I had, I ſhould not have left my company. If it do diſpleaſe you, ſaid I, I will begg your pardon; but, if it do not, I was never in my life better payed for my indiſcretion then now. What do you mean ſaid ſhe unto me? I do mean, fair <hi>Floriante,</hi> ſaid I, that I did never ſee any ſo fair as now I do. See how you can lie, ſaid ſhe; and then ſtriking me gently upon the cheek, ſhe ran to her company. This <hi>Floriante</hi> was the daughter of a very brave Cavaller, who was then ſick, and dwelt upon the coaſt of <hi>Ara,</hi> and ſhe hearing of his ſickneſſe, was
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53526:66"/>
going to him, having been with one of her Siſters, who was married in <hi>Arles.</hi> For matter of beauty ſhe was well enough; but ſhe was ſo full of gawderies, and of ſuch a galliard hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, as I muſt confeſſe, all my good-will to <hi>Aymea</hi> was forgotten, and ſo ſuddainly, as I never at all reſented any diſpleaſure at parting from her; for, this new commer furniſhed me with content enough, to caſt away all care. Thus then I left <hi>Aymea,</hi> as I thought, and was all for <hi>Floriante:</hi> I do ſay [as I thought] for it was not entirely, ſince very often, when I ſaw her I took delight in talking with her, though my affection to the other did draw me a little more violently: But, the truth is, when I had well conſidered with my ſelfe, I found, that in lieu of one, I loved both. Indeed it was no great trouble to me; for when I was with <hi>Floriante,</hi> I never ſo much as remembered, whether any ſuch a woman as <hi>Aymea</hi> was in the world; and when I was with <hi>Aymea, Floriante</hi> was a hundred miles out of my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: Nothing troubled me ſo much, as when I was far from them both, for then I grieved for both. Thus, generous <hi>Paris,</hi> did I ſpend my time, till I came to <hi>Vienna,</hi> where being in our lodging, (for we landed every night at ſome good Town or other) a Shepheardeſſe came, and deſired the Maſter of the Ship or Boat, to give her room in it as far as <hi>Lyons;</hi> pretending that her Husband had been wounded in the Warres, and had ſent for her. The Maſter of the Boat being very civill, did very kindly receive her; and ſo the next morning ſhe went into the Boat with us: She was fair, and ſo modeſt and diſcreet, as ſhe was no leſſe commendable for her vertue than her beauty; but, ſo ſad and melancholly, as ſhe moved all the company to pitty her: And I being ever very compaſſionate towards the afflicted, I did, amongſt the reſt, extreamly pitty her alſo, and cheered her up as much as poſſibly I could: at which <hi>Floriante</hi> was nothing pleaſed, nor <hi>Aymea</hi> neither. Now, generous <hi>Paris,</hi> you muſt conſider, that though a woman do put a fained gloſſe upon it, yet, ſhe cannot for her life chooſe, but reſent the loſſe of any Lover, as thinking it an affront unto her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and beauty being a thing moſt deer unto that Sex, it is the moſt ſenſible thing that is in them. However, I, that began to blend a little Love with my compaſſion, not ſeeming to regard theſe two Shepheardeſſes, did continue on my diſcourſe unto this; and amongſt otherthings, to the end we ſhould not let down diſcourſe, and alſo to have more acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with her, I did intreat her to tell me the occaſion of her ſadneſſe; and ſhe being fluent in courteſie, began thus:</p>
               <p>The compaſſion which you ſeem to have of my griefe, obligeth me, courteous Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, to give you that ſatisfaction which you deſire; and I ſhould think it a great crime to refuſe ſo ſmall a thing: But yet, I do beſeech you to conſider the condition I am in, and excuſe me, if I do abbreviate my diſcourſe into as little room as poſſibly I can. Know then, Shepheard, that I was born upon the coaſt of the River <hi>Loire,</hi> where I have been educated with as much tender care, as poſſibly one of my quality could be, untill the fifteenth year of my age. My name is <hi>Cloris,</hi> my Father's <hi>Leonces,</hi> Brother to <hi>Gereſtan,</hi> into whoſe hands I was transferred after the death of my Father and Mother. And here I began to reſent the blowes of fortune; for, my Uncle having more care of his own Children than of me, did think himſelfe overcharged with me. All the comfort I had was in his Wife, whoſe name was <hi>Callirea,</hi> for ſhe loved me, and furniſhed me with all things that I wanted, unknown to her Husband. But the heavens had decreed to afflict me; for, when <hi>Filander, Callirea's</hi> Brother, was killed, ſhe took his death ſo ſadly, that within a few daies after ſhe died, and I was left, with her two Daughters, ſo young, as could afford me no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. It happened, that a Shepheard of the Province of <hi>Viennoiſe,</hi> called <hi>Roſidon,</hi> came to viſit the Temple of <hi>Hercules,</hi> which is upon the coaſt of <hi>Furan,</hi> ſeated upon a high Rock, which elevates its head above all the reſt of the Mountains: That day on which he came thither, was a day of great ſolemnitie, and many Shepheards and Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſes were there alſo. It would be impertinent to relate all paſſages, and the manner how he declared his Love unto me: but ſo it was, that ever ſince that day he has ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted himſelfe to me, as he became wholly mine. He was young and handſome; and as for his Eſtate, it was much better than ever I could hope for: Moreover, his Spirit and his Body were ſo reſemblant and ſutable, as did make up a moſt perfect compoſure. His courtſhip continued four years, in all which time, I cannot ſay, he ever did or thought any thing, which he did not render me an account of, and asked my advice This extream ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and long continuance, did aſſure me of his Love and merits, and obliged me to love him extreamly. We lived and loved thus above a year, in as much perfect amitie, as could poſſibly be between two Lovers, and at laſt, our joyes were compleated in our Marriage. Now were we as happy as Mortalls could be, conducted we were to the Temple, the Songs

of <hi>Hymen</hi> did ſound on all ſides; and being returned to our lodgings, nothing was to be heard but Inſtruments of joy; and when we were in the height of felicity, we were ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the moſt averſe fate that ever chanced unto any. We were then at <hi>Vienna,</hi> where the greateſt part of <hi>Roſidor's</hi> Eſtate did lie. It hapned, that ſome debauched young fellowes of thoſe Townes about <hi>Lyons,</hi> where our Druides uſe to keep the misſltoe which they got in the great Forreſt of <hi>Mars,</hi> would needs commit ſome diſorders, which my Husband could not brook but after ſome gentle diſſwaſions, did hinder them in the execution; at which they were ſo incenſed, that (thinking they could not anger <hi>Roſidor</hi> worſe, then to affront me) one of them offered to throw a glaſſe of Inke in my face: but, I ſeeing the blow coming, turned aſide my head, ſo as I had none of it light upon me but in my neck, the marks whereof are yet very freſh. My Husband ſeeing my breaſt full of Inke and blood, did think that I was wounded, and therefore drew his ſword, and ran it through the body of him that gave me this affront, and afterwards, with the help of ſome friends, did drive them away. Judge, Shepheard, how much I was troubled; for, I thought my ſelfe worſe wounded than I was, and when I ſaw my husband all bloody, with a wound which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived on his ſhoulder. But, after this firſt fray was parted, and his wound ſearched, he had no ſooner dreſſed himſelfe, but Officers came to ſeize upon him, and carried him away with ſuch violence, that they would not permit me ſo much as to bid him adieu; but, my affection was ſo much above their denyall, that I did come unto him, and held him about the neck ſo faſt, that they could hardly pull me off. On the other ſide, he ſeeing me in this condition and chuſing rather to die, than to part from me, did ſo ſhew both his love and courage, that though wounded, yet he broke from them, and got out of the Town: This kept him from an Impriſonment, but it made his cauſe worſe in the eye of Juſtice, which cauſed ſeverall Proclamations to iſſue out againſt him: During all which time, his greateſt griefe was, that he could not be with me; and his deſire of ſeeing me being very great; he diſguiſed himſelfe, and in the night came unto me, and there ſtayed: God knowes how great my joyes were, and alſo how great my fears for, I knew, that his purſuers, knowing his love to me, would have all eyes about the houſe, and do all they could poſſible to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him: And it hapned as I alwaies feared: for there he was taken, and carried to <hi>Lyons,</hi> whither preſently I followed, and very opportunely for him: for, the Judges, whom I continually ſolicited, had ſo much pitty of me, that they ſhewed him favour: and ſo, maugre all the purſuit of his enemies, he was delivered. As I had abundance of trouble in the buſineſſe, ſo, courteous Shepheard, I had abundance of joy to ſee him out of all danger: But, becauſe his Priſon had made him very ſick, he was forced to ſtay a few daies in <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and I with him, endeavouring to cheer him up as well as poſſibly I could. At laſt being out of danger, he entreated me to go unto his houſe, and prepare all things for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of his friends, whom he would invite to rejoyce with him, for his good ſucceſſe in his buſineſſe: When I was gone, theſe debauched fellowes ſeeing they could not revenge themſelves by Law, they reſolved to murder him in his bed and entring into his lodging, gave him two or three ſtabbs with a Dagger, and leaving him dead as they thought, fled. Judge, kinde Shepheard, what cauſe have I to grieve at this fatall accident.</p>
               <p>Thus ended <hi>Cloris</hi> her ſtory, with eyes ſwimming in tears, which dropped upon her fair breaſt like links of Pearl. Now, generous Shepheard, this which I am now about to tell you, is a freſh gale of Love: The ſorrowes which I ſaw in this Shepheardeſſe, moved me unto ſo much compaſſion, that though her face perhaps was not able to cauſe love, yet plain pitty touched me ſo to the quick, that I muſt confeſſe, neither <hi>Carlis, Stilliana, Aymea, Floriana,</hi> nor all of them together, ever tyed me in ſuch ſtrong chaines, as this poor deſolate <hi>Cloris;</hi> not that I did not love thoſe, but becauſe there was yet a place void in my ſoul for this Thus ſee me reſolved upon <hi>Cloris</hi> as upon the reſt; but I knew it was to no purpoſe to mention my love unto her, untill <hi>Roſidor</hi> were either dead or recovered, for her ſorrowes had taken up all her ſoul. Thus came we to <hi>Lyons,</hi> where every one parted, and my new affection unto <hi>Cloris</hi> moved me to wait upon her to her lodging, where I did viſit <hi>Roſidor,</hi> purpoſely to be acquainted with her; for I knew, the way to get into the favour of the Wife, was, to begin with the Husband. She thought, he had been much more wounded than ſhe found him, (for what one fears, is alwaies apprehended in the worſe ſenſe) and changed colour when ſhe ſaw him up, and walking about the Chamber. But ſee how things happen, the ſorrowes of <hi>Cloris</hi> in the Boat was the ground of my affection; and now her joyes and contentment makes it die, which argues, that a diſeaſe may be cured by its contraries: for, I entred into the houſe a captive, and went out a man of liberty, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53526:67"/>
Maſter of my ſelfe: But, conſidering this accident, I called <hi>Aymea</hi> and <hi>Floriante</hi> into my memory again. Now am I preſently in queſt of their lodgings, and enquiring of every one I met with; at laſt by fortune, I found them both together. The next morning was the great Feaſt of <hi>Venus,</hi> and according to the cuſtome of the day, the preceding day unto the Feſtivall, the Maids do ſing in the Temple Authems, unto the honour of that goddeſſe, and remain there untill midnight: I heard, that the Step-mother of <hi>Aymea</hi> would be then there in performance of her vow; <hi>Floriante,</hi> at the earneſt requeſt of <hi>Aymea,</hi> promiſed to be there alſo: And I reſolved to diſguiſe my ſelfe in the habit of a Virgin, and to get in when it was dark: and when I was in, I ſtayed in the moſt blinde and leaſt frequented cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Temple till it was nine or ten of the clock. Then was the dores ſhut, and not a man but my ſelf in, unleſſe ſome that might be as full of curioſity as my ſelfe and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed: but when the Hymnes began, then came I out of my lurking corner: And becauſe the Temple was very large, and had no lights but ſuch as was about the Altar, I might the more ſafely mingle amongſt the reſt of the Virgins, without fear of being knowne. Then looking about me where <hi>Aymea</hi> was, I ſaw her carry a taper unto a young Virgin, who riſing up, aprpoached the Altar; and after ſome certain ceremonies ſhe began to ſing ſome ſtaves, which at the end of every ſtave was anſwered by all the company as a <hi>Chorus:</hi> I know not whether it was the dimneſſe of the light. (For it does often hide the imperfections of a complexion) or what it was, or whether ſhe was really very faire, but ſo it was, that as ſoone as ever I ſaw her, I loved her. Some affirme that Love proceeds from the eyes of the party loved but this cannot be; for her eye never looked upon me, nor did mine ſee her ſo much as to know her againe; and this was the reaſon that I thruſt in amongſt the Shepherdeſſes that ſtood neereſt her. But, but as ill luck was, after I had with much dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger gotten neere her, ſhe ended her Anthem, and carried her taper into its wonted place, ſo as it became ſo darke that though neere her, yet could I not well ſee her. Yet in hope that eyther ſhe or ſome other would ere long ſing again, I ſtayed there a little longer, but I perceived the light was carried into another Quire, and preſently after, one that was there began to ſing, as my new, and unknown Miſtriſs had done before: the difference betwixt them both in voice and face, was very great, for neither was comparable unto her that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to love: ſo as not being able to hold out any longer, I addreſſed my ſelfe unto a Lady was the further off from any company, and counterfetting my voice as well as poſſible I could, I asked her who it was that ſung the laſt before. Certainly, ſaid ſhe, you are a meere ſtranger that askes this queſtion, and does not know her. Perhaps, ſaid I, I ſhould know her, did I heare her named. Who does not know that, ſaid ſhe, by her face, does ask that queſtion in vain; but to ſatisfie you, her name is <hi>Cyrcenna,</hi> the faireſt Virgin that is in all the Country, and ſo known unto every-one, that if you do not know her, certainly you are of another world. Hitherto I counterfeited my voice ſo well, that as the night deceived her eyes, ſo my words did her eares, but not forgetting my ſelfe I told her, that in recompence of that favour ſhe had done me no man could be more her ſervant then my ſelfe. How's this ſaid ſhe unto me, who are you that uſeth any ſuch lauguage unto me? then obſerving me a little more neerely, ſhe found by my dreſſe and Garb, what I was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then in a great amaze ſhe ſaid unto me? how durſt you be ſo bold, as thus to break the holy lawes of this ſacred place? do you not know, that you muſt expiate this crime with the loſſe of your life? The truth is I did not think the puniſhment had been ſo great: but ſeeming unto her, to be a ſtranger, and ignorant of their ſtatutes, ſhe took pitty upon me and ſaid that it was a thing impoſſible to obtain a pardon, ſo rigorous was the law. Yet ſeeing that I did not come with any bad intention, ſhe would do what ſhe could to ſave me. And in order to that, I muſt not ſtay untill th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> midnight bell did ring, for then all the <hi>Druides</hi> would come unto the Temple dore with Torches or candles and look upon all their faces. But now the dore was ſhut, yet ſhe would try if ſhe could get it open; then putting a vaile upon my head and lending me her Mantle, it did ſo muffle me up as in the night none could know whether I was man or woman: being thus equipped, ſhe told one of her neighbours that came with her ſhe was not well ſo they went both together to deſire the key of the dore upon that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. And going all three together unto the dore with a little candle, which ſhe almoſt covered with her hand, for feare of the wind, we crowded out altogether, and ſo by her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour I eſcaped that dainger: Then the better to diſguiſe the matter, alſo out of a deſire to know unto whom I was ſo much obliged, I went amongſt the reſt, unto her lodging.</p>
               <p>But fair Shepheardeſſe, (ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> and addreſſed himſelfe unto <hi>Diana)</hi> this diſcourſe is not yet at the halfe; and me thinks the Sunne is low, therefore I conceive it convenient
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53526:67"/>
to referre the ſequell untill another opportunitie. Tis very true, courteous Shepheard, ſaid ſhe, we muſt not ſpend all we have at once. And therefore will ſave ſome againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time: beſides, <hi>Paris</hi> who has a long way home, would be put upon the night, ſhould he ſtay any longer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I can never think the time long, ſaid he, as long as it is ſpent in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. I wiſh Sir, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> there were any thing in me worth your acceptation and I ſhould moſt willingly devote it to your ſervice: for your merit and civility obliges every one unto it. <hi>Paris</hi> would have anſwered, when <hi>Hylas</hi> interrupted him by ſaying; I would to god, generous <hi>Paris,</hi> that I were you; and <hi>Diana, Phillis,</hi> that I might have the honour of ſuch language from her: If it were ſo ſaid <hi>Paris,</hi> you could not be more obliged to her, then both you and I am. Tis true, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> but I did never feare being more obliged, unto thoſe who already have entirely obliged me; your obligations <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid <hi>Diana</hi> are none of the longeſt dates, for you can break looſe from them when you pleaſe. It's good, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, to have two ſtrings to a bow, for if one fail the other may do ſervice: and I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that <hi>Phillis</hi> is glad I am of that humour, for otherwiſe ſhe might ſleight my ſervice. With ſuch diſcourſe as this <hi>Diana, Paris,</hi> and ſeverall other Shepheardeſſes, came to the great Plain where they alwaies uſed to aſſemble, before they parted; and then <hi>Paris</hi> bidding good night unto <hi>Diana,</hi> and the reſt of the company, he went towards <hi>Laigneu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this while <hi>Lycidas</hi> was talking with <hi>Phillis;</hi> and his jealouſie of <hi>Silvander</hi> did ſo torment him, that he was not able to bear the weight of it upon his heart untill the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: he was ſo much out of himſelfe, as he never minded whether any eares could overhear; but thinking he was alone with her, after a hundred deep ſighes, he thus began to eaſe himſelfe. Is it poſſible, <hi>Phillis,</hi> (ſaid he unto her) that the heavens ſhould preſerve my life ſo long as to make me reſent your infidelity? The Shepheardeſſe who expected any other diſcourſe ſooner than this, was ſo ſurprized at it, that ſhe could not anſwer; and the Shepheard ſeeing her mute, and thinking it was onely to pump for ſome excuſe, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued on: You have reaſon indeed, fair Shepheardeſſe not to give me any anſwer; for your eyes do too well ſpeak the truth to let me ever hope for any happineſſie: and your ſilence does but too well anſwer and aſſure me of what I deſire to know. The Shepheardeſſe being extreamly offended at this language, did in a very angry maner give him this anſwer Since my eyes can ſpeak ſo wel for me, why would you have me anſwer you any otherwiſe? &amp; if my ſilence can ſo wel inform you of my infidelity, that all my former actions cannot aſſure you of my affection, do you think I can ever hope that words wil be a better teſtimony? but I perceive, <hi>Lycidas,</hi> that you would gladly make an honeſt retreat: you have a deſigne ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where elſe, and not daring it without ſome colorable excuſe of your levitie, you faign theſe Chimeras of diſpleaſure, that your fault may reflect upon me. But, <hi>Lycidas,</hi> bring out your reaſons to the Teſt, let us ſee what they are; and if you will not, then get you gone and do not accuſe me with your own crimes: let your continuall complaints wherewith you trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both heaven and earth, reflect upon ſome body elſe not me, who am moſt mortally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at them. My doubts did much diſpleaſe me, replyed the Shepheard, but this aſſurance which your tart language gives me, makes me die. I pray you ſaid the Shepheardeſs, what are your feares? Not little ones, anſwered he, ſince the complaints which proceed from them does trouble both heaven and earth, as you do upbraid me. And if you would know them I will in few words tell you, that I fear <hi>Phillis</hi> does not love <hi>Lycidas.</hi> Is it ſo Shepheard, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Phillis;</hi> can you think that I do not love you. Yet remember what you did for me and <hi>Olimpia?</hi> Is it poſſible you ſhould conſider my former actions, yet make any ſuch doubts? I do know, anſwered the Shepheard, that you did love me; and had I doubted it, my griefe had not been ſo great as it is: but I feare a great wound though it do not kil, yet it wil leave a ſcarr: and that which love made in you, does only leave a mark that it was a wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phillis</hi> turning her head aſide at theſe words, with a diſcontented geſture anſwered him thus; ſince Shepherd I ſee, that all my good offices and teſtimonies of affection, have no better operation, I do aſſure you that the greateſt griefe I will have, ſhall be the pains and time I have beſtowed. <hi>Lycidas</hi> ſaw, that he had much offended his Shepheardeſſe; but he himſelfe was ſo full of jealouſie, that he could not chuſe but returne this anſwer; This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Shepheardeſs (ſaid he) is but a freſh confirmation of my feares: for to be angry when you are put in mind of a great affection, is a ſigne it never was accepted. <hi>Phillis</hi> hearing this reproach, turned aſide and anſwered; <hi>Lycidas</hi> diſſimulation in all manner of perſons, did ever diſpleaſe me, eſpecially in thoſe I would luſt withall; can <hi>Lycidas</hi> tel me that he doubts my affection and I not think he diſſembles? What teſtimonies can I give more than I have already? Shepherd, Shepherd, theſe words beleeve me makes me ſuſpect thoſe aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53526:68"/>
which heretofore you have given of your affection, for it may be that you would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me in your Love, as it ſeemes you do your ſelfe in mine. Shepheardeſſe, anſwered <hi>Lycidas,</hi> were my affection of the common ſtrain, as to conſiſt more in ſhew then realitie, I ſhould condemn my ſelfe, for ſuffering the violence of it to tranſport me beyond the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of reaſon; but, ſince it is not of ſo low an ebb; but, as you know, did flow like an Ocean, you muſt think, ſuch an extream love is never without ſome fears, though they have no cauſe, thoſe fears do turn themſelves into jealouſie, and jealouſie into grief, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into ſuch a frenzie, as you may perceive in me.</p>
               <p>Whilſt <hi>Lycidas</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> were talking thus, thinking theſe words were heard only by themſelves, and that Trees have no ears, <hi>Silvander</hi> was behind a Tree, and loſt not a ſyllable: <hi>Laonice</hi> alſo, who was aſleep there, ſhe wakened at the beginning of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and knowing them both, was very glad ſhe was there ſo opportunely, aſſuring her ſelfe, that before they parted, they would impart many ſecrets unto each other, which ſhe might employ to their ruine; and it happened according to her hopes, for <hi>Phillis</hi> hearing <hi>Lycidas</hi> ſay, that he was jealous, asked him, Of whom? and Why? Oh Shepheardeſſe, anſwered the wounded <hi>Lycidas,</hi> do you ask me this queſtion? I beſeech you tell me, from whence proceeds all that faint and hollow coldneſſe, which you have uſed towards me of late? and that great familiarity with <hi>Silvander,</hi> unleſſe your affection to me had been withdrawn and conferr'd upon him. Ah Shepheardeſſe, you muſt not think, but my heart is very ſenſible of ſuch blowes, ſince it hath reſented thoſe from your fair, but falſe eyes: how came you to fall off from me? why would not you ſpeak as familiarly unto me as you were wont? where is all the care which heretofore you uſed, in enquiring how I did? and your griefe, when I was at any time abſent? You can remember, when the name of <hi>Lyci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> founded ſweetly in your ears? and I do remember, when out of the abundance of your heart, you named him when you ſhould have named another: But now, who but <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Silvander</hi> is in the ſame heart and tongue, where <hi>Lycidas</hi> had once a conſiderable room; but now, the verieſt ſtranger in all the Country, is preferred before him, that is ſtill the ſame <hi>Lycidas</hi> that ever he was, and was born only unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> whom he now ſuſpects.</p>
               <p>The extream diſpleaſure of <hi>Lycidas</hi> did force out ſo many words, as <hi>Phillis</hi> could not put in one by way of interruption; for, if ſhe opened her mouth to ſpeak, he ſtill continued on with more vehemency, not conſidering, that the more he complained, the more his miſery encreaſed, and that if any thing could cure him, it was that anſwer which he would not hear: And, never conſidering that it was his torrent of words which hindred the Shepheardeſſe from anſwering, he conceived, that her ſilence proceeded from her guilt, ſo as every action that ſhe uſed, did more and more augment his jealouſie. The Shephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe all this while was ſo amazed and offended, that ſhe had not time to convince him of his error; but, though ſomething dark, he ſaw her bluſh, at leaſt thought ſo, which then did put him out of all; taking that for granted now, which he did but doubt of before. Thus, after he had called upon the Gods, that were juſt puniſhers of all infidelitie, he ran away from her through the wood, and would not hear her, when ſhe call'd him back; ſhe followed, intending to convince him of his error, but it was in vain; for, he ran ſo faſt, as ſhe quickly loſt the ſight of him in the thick wood. In the mean time, <hi>Laonice</hi> was very glad that ſhe had diſcovered this affection, and to ſee ſo good a beginning of her deſigne, and therefore ſhe retired: <hi>Silvander</hi> on the other ſide, ſeeing <hi>Lycidas</hi> was ſo apt to be jealous, he reſolved for the future to be the bellowes, that would blow it into a greater flame, and would ſeem, as if he loved <hi>Phillis</hi> in earneſt, the next time he ſaw him with her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonida</hi> in the mean time came to the houſe of <hi>Adamas,</hi> and letting him underſtand, that <hi>Galathea</hi> had extraordinary buſineſſe with him; he reſolved to ſet out as ſoon as the Moon began to ſhine, which would be about an houre before day, and accordingly they did ſo: When they were come to the bottom of the Hill, and had only a long plain to go through, before they came to the Pallace of <hi>Iſaure,</hi> the Nymph, at the requeſt of her Uncle, began to relate the buſineſſe thus.</p>

                  <hi>The Hiſtory of</hi> Galathea <hi>and</hi> Lindamor.</head>
               <p>DO not wonder, I beſeech you, Father (for ſo ſhe called him) I ſhould entreat you to hear me with patience, and when you ſee occaſion, to remember, that it is the very ſame Love which is the cauſe of all this, which in former times has driven you upon the like, if not ſtranger accidents. I durſt never have ſpoken to you about it, had I not had both permiſſion and a command to do it: But <hi>Galathea,</hi> whom the buſineſs concerns, doth earneſtly deſire, ſince ſhe hath made choice of you for the Phyſician to cure her, that you ſhould be acquainted with it, both the beginning and progreſs, and that it may be kept ſecret from all the world. The <hi>Druide</hi> (who knew what reverence was due unto his Lady (for ſo he reputed her) did anſwer, that his Prudence taught him to conceal any thing that concerned <hi>Galathea,</hi> and therefore any promiſe concerning that, was ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous. Upon that aſſurance (ſaid <hi>Leonida)</hi> I ſhall acquaint you with the buſineſſe. It is a long time ſince <hi>Polemas</hi> firſt begun to love <hi>Galathea:</hi> To tell you how it came to paſſe, is to no purpoſe; but ſo it was, he did love her. This love proceeded ſo on, that <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi> her ſelf could not be ignorant of it, but did many times in private make it appear, that his ſervice was not diſpleaſing unto her: And truly he was a man of very high deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings. As for his Pedigree, it is, as you know, derived from the ancient Line of <hi>Surieu,</hi> which in Nobleneſſe is not inferiour unto <hi>Galathea</hi> her ſelf. As for his Perſon, he is very handſom; every way ſo compoſed, as to move Love. Above all, he is a great Scholar, and in any Learning can ſilence the greateſt Doctors. But, Father, all theſe things are known unto you, better than I can relate them. But ſo it was, that theſe qualities did ſo recommend him unto the conſideration of <hi>Galathea,</hi> that ſhe was more favourable unto him, than unto any in the Court of <hi>Amaſis;</hi> yet it was with ſo much diſcretion, that none could ever take any notice of it. Then <hi>Polemas,</hi> having ſuch a favourable wind, did ſail ſo contentedly in the ſea of his hopes, as no man could live more happily than hee. But this inconſtant Love, or rather inconſtant Fortune, would have <hi>Polemas,</hi> as well as the reſt of the world, feel the ſharpneſs of thoſe Arrows which are ſhot from his Bow. You may remember the time when <hi>Amaſis</hi> permitted <hi>Clidaman</hi> to beſtow ſervants upon us all. Upon that occaſion, Love, like ſwarms, did riſe both in Court and Country; &amp; amongſt the reſt, <hi>Lindamor's</hi> lot did fal upon <hi>Galathea.</hi> His merits alſo were very high; yet ſhe did look as ſhily upon him, as the ceremony of that Feſtivall would permit her. But he, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps had before that ſome ſuch intention, though he durſt not let it break out beyond the limits of his diſcretion was very glad of this occaſion, under which he might veyl his real paſſions, as under a fiction. As <hi>Polemas</hi> did ſtomack this new Amity at the firſt, ſo the progreſs of it proved much more vexatious to him. Though <hi>Galathea</hi> did receive him with ſome ſhew of ſweetneſſe, by way of common courteſie, and after the example of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nimphs, yet this in any reaſon could not be offenſive to him, becauſe ſhe was obliged to it both by the Law, and the example of others. But when this Courtſhip went further than the bounders of courteſie and civility, then did he perceive it to be in good earneſt; and then did he reſent ſuch pangs of Jealouſie, as are uſuall in a ſoul that is really in love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galathea</hi> for her part, never thought of any ſuch thing, or at the leaſt did not beleeve, it was ſo far on: But occaſions, which, like drops of rain, do follow one another did ſo apparently appear, that <hi>Polemas</hi> might well be excuſed for ſuffering himſelf to be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſo ſharp a Sword as Jealouſie. <hi>Lindamor</hi> was Generous and Noble, and adorned with all deſirable qualities, that a perſon well born could poſſible be: as courtly amongſt Ladies, as brave in Martial matters, and as full of Courage and Valour, as any that our Court produced many years. He had arrived to the age of five and twenty yeares, before ever he felt any ſuch effects as Love uſeth to produce in hearts of his age. Not but that he was, of his natural inclination, a much devoted ſervant unto Ladyes but being continually exerciſed in buſineſſes much different from idleneſs, he had not leiſure to let Love ſow any ſeeds in his ſoul; for ever ſince hee was able to bear Armes moved by a Generous inſtinct, which invites Noble ſpirits unto dangerous enterprizes, he was perpetually in Wars, where he did moſt heroickly ſignalize himſelf. Afterwards, coming to ſee <hi>Clidaman,</hi> and to pay that homage unto which he was obliged, at one and the ſame time he devoted himſelf unto two: To <hi>Clidaman</hi> as his Lord, and to <hi>Galathea</hi> as his Lady; comming to Court, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53526:69"/>
any deſign upon either. But the ſweet affability of the young <hi>Clidaman,</hi> and the merits of the fair <hi>Galathea,</hi> were Loadſtones of ſuch attractive virtue, as did draw him to their ſervice. Thus did <hi>Lindamor</hi> begin to love, and ſo that he could not umbrage his affection under the veil of courteſie and complement. <hi>Polemas,</hi> as one that had intereſt, did preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive it; yet being friends, he ſeemed to take no notice, but ſtil courted his friendſhip, to the end he might ruin him by Artifice, as afterwards he attempted: And having, as I told you, made profeſſion of amity already unto him, it was the more eaſie to continue it. At this time <hi>Clidaman,</hi> began to affect Tilting and Juſts, wherein for a beginner he got ſome honour. But <hi>Lindamor</hi> was the man that ſtill carried away all the glory and applauſe of all. At which <hi>Polemas</hi> was ſo ſtung at the heart, that he could no longer diſſemble his grudge; ſo as hee would needs have a turn with him at Tilting, thinking that he being elder, and having a ſtronger Arm, he might wel enough undertake his Rival, and get the glory; but he proved to be only a foil unto <hi>Lindamors</hi> luſtre. The laſt day of the Baccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, when the young <hi>Clidaman</hi> held a Turnement in maintaining the beauty of <hi>Silvia, Guyemant</hi> and <hi>Lindamor</hi> did get as much glory as mortal men could do, but eſpecially <hi>Lindamor,</hi> who had the favour and good fortune that though <hi>Galathea</hi> was not the Judge, yet, In ſpite of Love, ſhee gave ſentence againſt <hi>Polemas.</hi> The Nimph, whoſe eyes could hardly look upon any but <hi>Polemas,</hi> could not now chuſe but highly applaud <hi>Lindamor:</hi> And obſerve how Love does play and mock at the Prudence of Lovers; that which <hi>Polemas</hi> imagined, would get him the advantage of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> did moſt hurt him, and made him almoſt his inferiour; for, every one ſpending their judgments, and comparing the actions of the one with the other, did finde ſuch a difference between them, that it had been better for him to have ſit quietly at home. That ſame night, <hi>Lindamor</hi> inſpir'd by ſome good Genius (which makes me believe, that there are ſome daies fortunate, ſome unfortunate) declared himſelfe in good earneſt a Servant unto the fair <hi>Galathea,</hi> and ſuch opportunities did fall upon him, as he could not wiſh for better: For, dancing a kinde of a Dance, which the <hi>Franks</hi> had newly brought out of <hi>Germany,</hi> in which, every one catched her whom they moſt fancyed; <hi>Lindamor</hi> guided by Love, but, as I think, thruſt upon it by Fate, did ſteal away <hi>Galathea</hi> from <hi>Polemas,</hi> who being more intent upon his diſcourſe than dancing, never heeded it, but went preſently, and twitted the Nymph with her affection unto <hi>Lindamor.</hi> She, who did not yet think <hi>Lindamor</hi> to be in earneſt, was much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at his diſcourſe, and took his language ſo ill, that it made <hi>Lindamor</hi> more pleaſing unto her: alſo, thinking upon ſome revenge for his jealouſie. I am the freer to ſpeak it, for none was better acquainted with all theſe paſſages than my ſelfe, who was deſtined to be a witneſſe of all the buſineſſe: For, aſſoon as all were retired to their lodgings, &amp; <hi>Galathea</hi> in bed, ſhe commanded me to ſtay by her &amp; hold a Candle, whilſt ſhe read ſome Letters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance which came to her. This night deſiring to be alone, ſhe diſmiſſed all the reſt of the Nymphs and when they were all gone, ſhe commanded me to ſhut the dore; afterwards ſhe made me ſit down upon her Bed; then, after a little ſmiling to her ſelf, ſhe ſaid thus unto me, I cannot chuſe but laugh, <hi>Leonida,</hi> at an encounter which I met with this night at the Ball, you know that <hi>Polemas</hi> has long profeſſed himſelf my ſervant and (let me tell it unto you, from whom I wil conceal nothing) that as long as he behaved himſelf towards me with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour &amp; reſpect, his ſervice was not diſpleaſing unto me, but I received him into more favour, then any other in this Court; yet, not out of any love on my ſide, I will not ſay, but perhaps love did flatter him with ſome hopes of obtaining what he deſired; but, the very truth is, I never yet found any thing in him which could force me ſo far as Love: I know not what may be in the time to come, but hitherto there is no likelyhood of it. Now <hi>Polemas,</hi> ſeeing I allowed him freedome of talk, and heard him with patience; alſo obſerving, that I did not expoſe my ſelfe ſo freely unto any other he is grown ſo bold, that he knowes not what he does, ſo much is he tranſported beſides himſelfe: This very night he danced with me, in ſuch a dull muſing manner, that I could not chuſe but raſhly ask him, what he ailed. Shall it not diſpleaſe you, ſaid he unto me, if I ſhould tell you? No, ſaid I, for I never uſe to ask a thing which I would not know. Upon this, he went on: I cannot chuſe, Madam, (ſaid he) but be extreamly ſad at ſome paſſages, which are very frequently in my eyes, and which touch me ſo to the quick, that had I but halfe as much aſſurance as I have ſuſpition, I know nothing that is able to keep that life which yet is in me. I do proreſt, I was ſo ill adviſed, that I could not imagine what he meant; yet, conceiving that his former amitie obliged me a little unto a farther curioſity, I asked him, what paſſages thoſe were which touched him ſo to the quick? Then looking ghaſtly upon me a long while, Is it poſſible,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53526:69"/>
Madam, (ſaid he upon a ſuddain) you ſhould ask me any ſuch queſtion? Why not, (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered I)? Becauſe, replied he, all theſe things are addreſſed unto you, and it is only from you that they do proceed. Then ſeeing me ſtand ſilent, for I did not know his meaning, he begun to walk and ſay; I do wonder you ſhould not bluſh, and I muſt tell you as much, though at the rate of my life: You know, Madam, with what zealous affection I have ſtriven to make my ſelf appear a moſt reall ſervant unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> ever ſince the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens devoted me to become hers you may well ſay, that hitherto you never ſaw the leaſt or greateſt of any action, that did not tend unto your ſervice that was the mark which all my thoughts did aim at: ſo as unleſſe fortune be extreamly averſe unto me you cannot chuſe, but afford me ſo much ſatisfaction at the leaſt, as to confeſſe, that I am ſolely yours, and none but yours: And ſince it is ſo, I beſeech you judge how great my griefe muſt needs be, when I ſee, contrary to all reaſon in Love, and when I might well have expected ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for my affection; when, I ſay, I ſee in my room another Favourit, and heir poſſeſſed of my eſtate before I die: I beſeech you excuſe the expreſſion, which flowes from the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of my paſſion, and forceth juſt complaints from my ſoul, which cannot any longer hold ſilent, ſeeing one triumph over me, that hath got the victory, more by deſtiny than merit: It is <hi>Lindamor</hi> I mean, <hi>Lindamor,</hi> I ſay, whoſe ſervices you entertain and favour above mine; my griefe is not to ſee him ſo happy as he himſelfe can wiſh, but to ſee him happy in my raine. I beſeech you Madam excuſe me, or rather excuſe the grandure of my affection, if I do complain, ſince it is only an argument of that power which you have over your moſt humble ſervant. I ſpeak thus, to obſerve unto you, Madam, that you uſe the very ſame language, and treat him in the very ſame manner, you were wont to uſe towards me, at the beginning of your goodwill to me, and at that time, when, me thought you knew my affection: This puts me beyond all patience, and ſo much beyond my ſelfe, that I am not able to command thoſe extravagancies which proceed from my ſoul, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport me beyond the limits of my diſcretion. He would have talked on, but his violent paſſion did ſo ſtop his breath, that he was not able to continue any longer. Judge you, whether I was not much offended at theſe words, for they were ſo full of vanitie and raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as were not to be endured: yet, becauſe I would not give any knowledge of it into ſuch, who have no eyes, but to prie into the actions of others, I was forced to give him an anſwer leſſe tart than otherwiſe I ſhould, and ſaid thus unto him: <hi>Polemas,</hi> whatſoever you are, and whatſoever I be, I never doubted, but that you were my ſervant, as long as you dwelt in my Mothers houſe, and did my Brother any ſervice but I muſt needs wonder at thoſe fooliſh termes you uſe in your diſcourſe of Heir, and your Eſtate truly I know not by what night you can pretend ſo much unto my amitie, as to call it youre. My intentiond, <hi>Polemas,</hi> were ever to love and eſteem you according to your merits, and never with you any more. And as to what you ſay concerning <hi>Lindamor,</hi> let me draw you out of that error for, if I did behave my ſelfe towards him as I did to you, I would have you think, I did no more then what I will do unto all ſuch as ſhall merit it: for without any further deſigne, I muſt and will love and eſteem worth whereſoever I do finde it. Why Madam, ſaid I unto her, and interrupted her, do you think this to be ſo mild an anſwer? I cannot tell how in any civility it could have been more ſharp: 'Tis true I muſt confeſſe that he is a little too preſumptuous, but it cannot be denied, that this preſumption in him is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome colour of reaſon. Of reaſon? ſaid the Nymph preſently, why, what reaſon can he alledge for it? Very many, Madam, (ſaid I unto her) but to be ſilent in all but one, I muſt tell you, that you have permitted him to ſerve you with more particularitie, then any other. It was, replyed <hi>Galathea,</hi> becauſe he pleaſed me better, then any of the reſt of my Brothers ſervants. I confeſſe it, anſwered I, and therefore when he ſaw himſelfe more favoured than any other, could he hope for leſſe, than to obtain you love? He hath heard of many examples of Love between perſons of unequall degree, and might therefore very well flatter himſelfe with the like hopes; and I do remember ſome Lines which he compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon this ſubject, and ſang them before you, when you commanded him to conceal his affection: The Lines were theſe.</p>

               <p>Then <hi>Adamas</hi> asked her this queſtion, How comes it to paſſe, <hi>Leonida,</hi> (ſaid he) that this <hi>Galathea</hi> by her words, ſeemes to ſleight <hi>Polemas,</hi> and yet by theſe Verſes, one would judge ſhe loves him, and that he cannot endure ſhe ſhould diſſemble it. Father, (anſwered <hi>Leonida)</hi> it is moſt true that ſhe did love him, and did give him ſo many proofs of it, as he had been but a very ſhallow man, had he not ſeen it: And though ſhe would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled it with me, yet, I do know, that ſhe drew him in, by ſuch artifices and hopes of her goodwill towards him, that I ſeeing demonſtrable aſſurances given him, did think her wholly his. But, he does moſt juſtly merit this puniſhment, for that perfidie which he hath uſed towards a Nymph, whoſe beguiled affection had juſt cauſe for revenge, which Love at the laſt did execute upon him. The truth is, he is the baſeſt impoſtor, the moſt ungratefull, and the moſt unworthy to be loved, that is under heaven, for his ingratitude; and if he do reſent that pain which others have endured for him, he deſerves no pitty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adamas,</hi> ſeeing her ſo exaſperated againſt <hi>Polemas,</hi> asked her, who that Nymph was which he had deceived; for, ſaid he to her, ſhe muſt needs be one of your friends, ſince you are ſo ſenſible of the offence which was done unto her. She now ſaw, that her paſſion had carried her too far, and that ſhe had unawares bolted out a thing, which had been kept long a ſecret: yet, having a quick wit, ſhe ſo diſſembled the buſineſſe, as <hi>Adamas</hi> took no notice of it. Do you not know, Daughter, (ſaid <hi>Adamas)</hi> that the aimes of all men is, to overcome and compaſſe the deſigne which they attempt; and the amitie which they ſhew unto you women when they love you, is but to make the way more eaſie: You ſee, <hi>Leoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> all Love is but a deſire of ſomething which is wanting; that deſire being ſadded and cloyed, is no more deſire; and there being no more deſire, there is no more love; and therefore thoſe that would be loved long, are thoſe that give leaſt ſatisfaction unto the deſires of their Lovers. But, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> ſhe whom I do ſpeak of, is one of my intimate friends, and I know, ſhe never treated <hi>Polemas,</hi> but with all the coldneſſe ſhe could. That, replied <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> did ſtifle deſire; for, deſire is nouriſhed by hopes and favours: As, a Lamp, when Oyle is wanting, doth extinguiſh; ſo does deſire die, when that which ſhould nouriſh it, is taken away: Thus does many Loves die, ſome, by too many, ſome, by too few, favours. But let us returne unto the diſcourſe betwixt <hi>Galathea</hi> and you, What was it which ſhe did ſay unto you? She ſaid thus, anſwered <hi>Leonida,</hi> If <hi>Polemas</hi> had been ſo diſcreet, as to meaſure himſelfe aright, as he was preſumptuous in loving me, he had taken theſe favours
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53526:70"/>
as flowing from my courteſie, and not love: But this is nothing to the paſſage that happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at that time, for I had no ſooner made an anſwer unto <hi>Polemas,</hi> but <hi>Lindamor,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order of the Dance, came, and ſtole me away; and ſo dexterouſly, that <hi>Polemas</hi> could not avoid it nor by the ſame means anſwer me, but with his eyes; but truly, he made ſuch a ſour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> face at me, as I could not for my heart but laugh; as for <hi>Lindamor,</hi> he either took no notice of it, or elſe would not make it appear; but preſently after, he talked to me after ſuch a manner, as was enough to make <hi>Polemas</hi> mad, had he heard it: Madam, ſaid he, is not this a fatall exchange? What do you mean, ſaid I unto him? I mean, ſaid he, that in this Dance I have ſtolne you, and in the very truth, you have ſtollen my ſoul and my heart. Then bluſhing at this, I returned this ſeeming angry anſwer, Fie, <hi>Lindamor,</hi> what ſtrange language is this? do you not conſider who you are, and who I am? I do ſo, Madam, ſaid he, and that does invite me to this language: for, are not you my Lady, and I your ſervant? Yes, anſwered I, but not ſo as you do intend it; for, it is your duty to ſerve me with reverence, and not love; or, if it be with any affection, it muſt be ſuch as proceeds from your duty. To which he preſently replyed, Madam, if I do not ſerve you with all humble reverence, never was any deitie reverenced by any mortall; but this reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence muſt be either the Father or the Child of my affection; and, call it what you pleaſe, I am reſolved to ſerve you, to love you, and to obey you; your merits, your perfections, and my own fate has made me eternally yours he that ſees and does not love you, deſerves not the name of Man: and <hi>Clidaman's</hi> Lottery, though it was ſome cauſe, yet was it only a cover of my ſoules affection. Theſe expreſſions were uttered with a vehemency, as made it plainly appear, that his heart and tongue agreed; and I beſeech you obſerve one plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant paſſage; for, ſaid <hi>Galathea</hi> to me, I never took any notice of this affection, thinking it to be only in jeaſt, and I never had perceived it, untill the jealouſie of <hi>Polemas</hi> did hint it unto my thoughts; but ever ſince, I have ſo ſet my thoughts upon <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and I have ſound him as well capable of cauſing love as jealouſie; and <hi>Polemas</hi> ever ſince that time hath ſo diſpleaſed me in all his actions, as I could hardly endure him: On the contrary, all <hi>Lindamors</hi> actions did ſeem ſo plauſible unto me, as I wondred that I ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them no ſooner; ſo as the jealouſie of <hi>Polemas</hi> did quench my love of him, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred my affection upon <hi>Lindamor.</hi> This change had ſuch an operation upon
<hi>Polemas,</hi> as ever ſince cauſed him to look aſquint upon me, and I am ſure my eyes did not look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as they were wont. When <hi>Galathea</hi> ſpoke thus againſt him, I was not at all ſorry, by reaſon of his ingratitude; but, on the contrary, the more to prejudice him, I ſaid thus unto her, I do not at all wonder, Madam, that <hi>Lindamor</hi> ſhould win more upon you than <hi>Polemas,</hi> for their qualities and parts are not comparable, and every one that ſees them, are of the ſame judgment you are: It is true indeed, I do foreſee much jangling will ariſe; firſt, betwixt them two; and ſecondly, betwixt you and <hi>Polemas.</hi> And why, ſaid <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi> to me, do you think he has ſuch an influence upon my actions or <hi>Lindamors?</hi> That is not it, Madam, that I do mean, ſaid I unto her; but, I am ſo well acquainted with the humour of <hi>Polemas,</hi> that he will try all manner of waies leave no ſtone unturned, and will conjure both heaven and earth, to ingratiate himſelfe unto that happineſſe which he hath loſt; and will commit ſuch groſſe follies, as will be viſible unto all, but ſuch as will not ſee them, and ſuch as will offend both you and <hi>Lindamor.</hi> No, no, <hi>Leonida,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe, if <hi>Lindamor</hi> do love me, he will do as I ſhall command him; and if he do not love me, he will never care what <hi>Polemas</hi> does: And as for <hi>Polemas,</hi> I know how to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. Upon theſe words ſhe commanded me to draw the Curtain, and took her reſt, at leaſt, as well as theſe new deſignes would permit her. But when the Ball was ended, <hi>Lindamor</hi> obſerving the diſcontented looks of <hi>Polemas,</hi> when he took <hi>Galathea</hi> from him, he had an opinion that he did love her; yet, having never obſerved it by any former paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, he reſolved to ask him, and if he did finde him in love, then to diſſwade him from it and this he thought himſelfe obliged unto by their former friendſhip: therefore comming unto him, he deſired to ſpeak a word with him in private. <hi>Polemas</hi> being as ſubtle as ever was any, did colour his countenance with a gloſſe of good will, and ſaid, What is it which <hi>Lindamor</hi> is pleaſed to command me? Oh Sir, ſaid <hi>Lindamor,</hi> I never uſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands where intreaties may prevail, and at this time I will make uſe of neither; but only as a friend ask you a queſtion, which our friendſhip obliges you to anſwer. Be it what it will, replied <hi>Polemas,</hi> you may be certain, I ſhall anſwer you with as much freedome, as you can deſire. It is this then, ſaid <hi>Lindamor,</hi> After I had ſerved <hi>Galathea</hi> a good while, according to the Ordinance of <hi>Clidaman,</hi> I was at laſt forced to do it by the commands
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53526:71"/>
of Love; for the truth is, after I had ſerved her according to the diſpoſe of fortune, who caſt me upon her great merits, ſhe had ſuch an influence upon my affection, as I did ratifie it by the dedication of my ſelf unto her; and therefore muſt aſſume to my ſelfe ſo much bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as to ſay, that I do love her: yet, that friendſhip, which is betwixt you and me, being contracted long before this love began, I reſolved to tell you, that if it be ſo, that you do Love her, and have any pretentions unto her, I hope that I have ſo much command over my ſelfe, as to make a retreat, and make it appeare that my love is leſſe then my friendſhip, and that the follies of the one ought to give place unto the wiſdome of the other: Tell me therefore, freely, how your ſoul is affected, to the end the lawes of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip between you and me may be obſerved: My intention is not to diſcover your ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes; and ſince I do thus ingenuouſly open my ſelfe unto you, I conceive you need not feare doing the like: for it is not out of any curioſitie, but onely a deſire to preſerve our friendſhip, that I ask you this queſtion. <hi>Lindamor</hi> ſpoke unto <hi>Polemas</hi> in ſuch a dialect as did become a friend, but like an ignorant lover, that thought ſuch a thing as a friend was to be found in matter of Love But <hi>Polemas</hi> the Grand diſſembler anſwer'd thus: <hi>Lindamor,</hi> this fair Nymph you ſpeak of, deſerves the Love and adoration of the whole univerſe: but as for me, I have no pretentions unto her But withall I muſt tel you, that for matter of Love, I conceive every one ought &amp; wil do what he can for himſelf. <hi>Lindamor</hi> did now repent himſelf of his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and civill language, ſince he had received ſuch an od anſwer: and reſolved to do what he could to advance himſelfe into the favour of this Nymph, yet he anſwered him thus: Since <hi>Polemas,</hi> you have no pretentions unto her, I will endeavour to preferre my ſelfe, unto a happineſſe, which to recede from, would be death it ſelfe unto me. For my part, ſaid <hi>Polemas,</hi> my pretentions unto her in matter of Love, are only with an eye of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and reſpect, ſuch as we are all obliged to render unto her. For my part, replyed <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi> I do honour <hi>Galathea,</hi> as our great Lady; and alſo do Love and adore her as my faireſt Miſtris: I do think my fortune may wel pretend unto ſuch a height, as to caſt my eyes upon her, and do conceive it is no offence unto a Divinity, to Love her. With ſuch diſcourſe as this they parted, both of them very ill ſatisfied with one another: but upon different grounds: for <hi>Polemas</hi> was ſtung with jealouſie, and <hi>Lindamor</hi> diſpleaſed at the perfidie of his friend; from this day they lived at a diſtance: for though indeed they were alwaies together, yet they did hide and diſgniſe their deſigues and actions, one from another: but <hi>Lindamor</hi> did not neglect a minute that could be imployed to make his affection appear unto this fair Nymph: and certainly he did not loſe eyther his time or paines; for it was ſo aceptable unto her, that though much love did not appear in her eyes, yet ſhe was ful of it in her heart; and becauſe it was a hard matter to conceale ſo great a fire but ſome flame will be flaſhing out, do what they could, therefore <hi>Galathea</hi> reſolved to talke to <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor</hi> as little as poſſible ſhe could, and to deviſe ſome way or other, for conveying letters ſecretly betwixt them: And in order to that, her deſigne was upon <hi>Flurial</hi> Nephew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Nurſe of <hi>Amaſis,</hi> and Brother unto hers, whoſe good will unto her, ſhe had been long accquainted with for he being the Gardiner at <hi>Mount-Briſon</hi> as his father was before him, when <hi>Galathea</hi> was brought thither to walk, he would often take her in his armes, and gather her what flowers ſhe pleaſed: and you know that ſuch infant amities as are ſuckt in with the milk, do become almoſt naturall: alſo ſhe knowing that all old people are covetous, ſhe was ſo liberal unto him that ſhe made him wholly hers. One day, when ſhe was got ſome diſtance from us, ſhe called him unto her, as if the buſineſſe was to enquire the names of ſome flowers, which ſhe had in her hand, and after ſhe had asked him ſeverall ſuch queſtions, ſhe ſaid thus unto him, in a low voice; Come hither <hi>Flurial</hi> doſt thou Love me? Madam, anſwered he, I were the vileſt varlet that ever breathed, if I did not Love you above all the world: May I be ſure of this thou ſayeſt? ſaid the Nymph. May I never live a minute, replyed he, if I had not rather neglect my duty to Heaven then to you How? Said <hi>Galathea,</hi> without any exception? ſuppoſe it were a thing that would offend <hi>Amaſis</hi> or <hi>Clidaman?</hi> I care not whom it would offend, ſaid <hi>Flurial,</hi> if you Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam command it, I will never enquire further for I am wholly yours; and though my Lady do pay me my wages; yet it is from you that my ſervice is conferred upon me: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I have ever from your very Infancy ſo loved you, that I did at the very firſt dedicate my ſelf wholly unto you But Madam, I beſeech you why ſo many words? I ſhall never be truly happy untill you put me to the tryall. Then ſaid <hi>Galathea</hi> to him, hark thee, <hi>Flurial;</hi> if thou continueſt in that reſolution and wilt be ſecret, thou ſhalt be the happieſt man alive of thy qualitie, and what I have done for thee in times paſt, is nothing in compariſon of

what I intend for the Future: but be ſure thou beeſt ſecret; and remember that if thou beeſt not, I ſhal become thy moſt mortal enemy; and aſſure thy ſelf nothing leſsthen thy life ſhal ſatisfy me. Go unto <hi>Lindamor</hi> and do as he ſhall direct thee; and beleeve it, I will reward thy vice beyond thy hopes, but ſtill be ſure thou doſt forget thou haſt a tongue. Upon theſe words, <hi>Galathea</hi> came to us and laughing told us, that <hi>Flurial</hi> and ſhe, had been in a long diſcourſe of Love; but, ſaid ſhe, it was upon love of the Garden, and the love of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. <hi>Flurial,</hi> for his part, after two or three turnes in the Garden, ſeeming as if he had ſome imployment, went out, with a mind full of this buſineſſe: for he was not ſo ignorant, but he knew well enough the dainger he ſhould incurre from <hi>Amaſis,</hi> if he were diſcovered, and from <hi>Galathea,</hi> if he did not execute her commands; imagining the buſineſſe, to be a matter of Love: and he had often heard ſay, that all offences againſt Love do wound the very heart; At laſt, his affection to <hi>Galathea</hi> and deſire of gaine together, made him reſolve, ſince he had promiſed to keep his word, and thereupon went preſently to <hi>Lindamor</hi> who expected him For the Nymph told him that ſhe would ſend <hi>Flurial</hi> unto him, and by him he might let her underſtand any thing he pleaſed. As ſoon as <hi>Lindamor</hi> ſaw him, he ſeemed as if he knew nothing, but asked before the company, if he had any buſineſſe with him? Unto which he anſwered aloud, that he came to beſeech him, he would be pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint <hi>Amaſis</hi> with his long ſervice, and the little wages he had received which was due unto him, and thereby he would create him his vaſſal: then in a low voice he acquainted him with the buſineſſe he came about, and offered to do him what ſervice he was pleaſed to command him. <hi>Lindamor,</hi> gave him thankes, and, acquainting him freely what he ſhould do, he conceived the way was handſomly contrived. So as from hence forward, when <hi>Lindamor</hi> would write unto her, <hi>Flurial</hi> ſeemed to preſent a Petition unto the Nymph and when ſhe would returne an anſwer, ſhe would give it unto him lapped up in that order, which <hi>Amaſis</hi> appointed in the buſineſſe upon the Petition. And becauſe it is ordinarie for many old Servants to have many things to Petition for; he wanted not occaſion to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent every hour a Petition unto her, who often obtain'd ſuch advantageous anſwers to them as were beyond all hopes. All this while the affection of this Nymph unto <hi>Polemas,</hi> did ſo wither, that ſhe could hardly ſpeake unto him without diſdaine: which he not being able to endure, and knowing well enough that all did proceed from her Love of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> he was ſo tranſported that though he durſt not ſpeak much againſt <hi>Galathea,</hi> yet he gave out many diſadvantageous ſpeeches againſt <hi>Lindamor;</hi> and amongſt the reſt, he ſaid, that though <hi>Lindamor</hi> was a very brave man, and accompliſhed with many remarkable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet his over good opinion of himſelfe did not take his meaſures aright, ſince he was ſo preſumptuous as to lift his eyes ſo high as <hi>Galathea;</hi> and that not only to Love her in his heart, but alſo to vaunt and bragge of it, in his diſcourſe. Which language came at laſt to the eares of <hi>Galathea;</hi> and indeed had ſo ſpread it ſelfe that all the Court was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it. The Nymph was ſo much offended at this, as ſhe reſolved to treat <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> ſo for the future, as he ſhould have no occaſion to publiſh her vanities &amp; this was the reaſon ſhe would not ſpeake unto him, and thoſe who obſerved her actions and behaviour, were perſwaded that there was no ſuch thing as Love betwixt them: And <hi>Lindamors</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture preſently after did much help on that belief; for <hi>Amaſis</hi> ſent him upon a buſineſſe of great importance, as far as the banks of the River <hi>Rhine:</hi> Yet his departure was not ſo ſuddain, but he found an opportunity of talking with <hi>Galathea,</hi> before he went to know the cauſe of her change: and watching for his time that morning when ſhe went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Temple with her Mother, he came to her, when ſhe was ſo in the midſt of us, that <hi>Amaſis</hi> could hardly ſee him. As ſoone as ſhe ſaw him, ſhe would have changed place, had he not held her by the Gown, and ſaid thus unto her: Madam, what is my offence? and why this alteration in you? She anſwered as ſhe was going away: There is neither any offence in you nor alteration in me: for I am ſtill the ſame <hi>Galathea,</hi> and you are ſtill the ſame <hi>Lindamor,</hi> a ſubject too low for me to be offended with. His actions did make it appear, how theſe words went to his heart for though he was juſt upon his departure, yet he could not give any orders of any buſineſſe, ſo much was his mind taken up with the thoughs of this matter: At laſt, finding himſelfe cleerely innocent, he writ this Letter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her.</p>

               <p>This Letter was brought her, as the cuſtom was, by <hi>Flurial</hi> and at ſuch a time, that though ſhe would, yet ſhe could not refuſe it, becauſe we were all about her: and the truth is, it is impoſſible any ſhould carry the buſineſſe better then <hi>Flurial</hi> did. For he preſented his Petitions with ſuch reverent and pittiful language, ſo ſutable unto the thing petitioned for, as he might deceive any whoſoever; as for me had not <hi>Galathea</hi> acquainted me, I ſhould never have taken any notice of it. But it being very hard or indeed impoſſible, for the young heart of this Nymph to endure without ſome Confident, unto whom it might impart it ſelfe amongſt the reſt ſhe did me the honour to make choice of me, as moſt affectionate, &amp; as ſhe thought moſt ſecret. So that as ſoon as ſhe receiv'd this Letter, ſhe ſeeming to have forgotten ſomething in her cloſſet, ſhe went thither and called me, telling the reſt of the Nymphs, ſhe would returne preſently to them again. She ſtayed a good while in her cloſſet, and ſpoke not a word, ſo as I perceived ſomthing did much trouble her: but yet I durſt not aske her for feare of vexing her: Yet ſhe did ſit down, and caſt <hi>Flnuials</hi> pettion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the table, ſaying unto me, this fool <hi>Flurial</hi> is continually troubling me with Letters from <hi>Lindamor:</hi> I pray <hi>Leonida</hi> tell him that I would have him bring no more: I was a little aſtoniſhed at this charge: yet I knew that Love cannot be long without ſome triviall quarrells, which in the end does but prove a pair of bellowes to blow the fire into a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter flame: therefore I ſaid thus unto her: When did he give you any, Madam? Not long replyed ſhe, do not you know of it? No certainly Madam, ſaid I unto her; Then with a frowning brow ſhe told me that indeed it was true, he was much in her favour; but now he had ſo much abuſed her favour, by his raſhneſſe and preſumption, that ſhe was quite out with him. I beſeech you ſaid I unto her, what is his fault? The fault, ſaid the Nymphs, is no great buſineſſe, yet it diſpleaſeth me more then if it were of greater importance. What a groſſe peece of vanitie was it in him to report it, that he was in love with me, &amp; that he had profeſſed it unto me? Oh, Madam, ſaid I unto her, this can never be true; his enemies certainly have invented it, onely to ruine him, both in your favour and the favour of <hi>Amaſis.</hi>
This may be, replied ſhe; but <hi>Polemas,</hi> reports it every where, &amp; yet he is ſilent and gives a check unto none of theſe reports, But ſuppoſe he do hear the report how can he help them? Said I unto her, what remedy would you have him uſe againſt them? what remedy? ſaid the Nymph, why a ſword, and death to the reporter. Truly Madam, ſaid I unto her, I have heard ſay that matters of love are ſo ſubject unto cenſure, that the leſſe it is medled with, it is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Theſe, ſaid ſhe, are but excuſes, but might he not very well have asked me, what courſe he ſhould take? Had he done ſo I ſhould have been ſatisfied. Have you ſeen the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Madam, ſaid I unto her, which he writ unto you? No, ſaid ſhe: and more then that, let me tell you, that I never will; but will avoid all occaſions of ever ſpeaking unto him. Then, I took the Petition of <hi>Flurial</hi> and read it aloud unto her; then ſaid thus; but good Madam, ought you not to love one that is wholly devoted unto you? and can you be ſo eaſily offended againſt him, that perhaps never offended you? Come, come, ſaid ſhe, if he does love me, I will make him pay deare intereſt for the pleaſure he takes in vaunting of our love: if I have heretofore given him any occaſion to think I ever loved him, I ſhall for the future give a ſtop unto all ſuch conceipts; and, to begin, I pray charge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>Flurial,</hi> that he never preſume to bring me any thing from this raſh and vain glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious man. Madam, ſaid I unto her, I ſhall do whatſoever you are pleaſed to command me; but give me leave to tell you, that I think it requiſit to conſider a little better upon the buſineſſe; for you may do your ſelfe an injury by thinking to ſpite another: you know what kind of fellow this <hi>Fluriall</hi> is, whoſe wit cannot reach beyond his Garden; ſhould you let
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53526:72"/>
him know of this paſſage betwixt <hi>Lindamor</hi> and you; I am afraid he ſhould diſcover the buſineſſe unto <hi>Amaſis,</hi> to excuſe himſelfe: For gods ſake, Madam, conſider what a diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure this would be unto you; were it not much better you did expoſtulate the matter with <hi>Lindamor?</hi> or, if that do not pleaſe you, then let me do it; for I aſſure my ſelfe, he will give you ſatisfaction, or elſe you may tell him your ſelfe when he departs, the occaſion o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> your breaking off with him, without making it known unto <hi>Fluriall.</hi> As for ſpea king with him, ſaid ſhe, I cannot do it, my courage will not permit it; nor will I permit any other, for I wiſh him not ſo well. When I ſaw her ſo incenſed againſt him, I told her, that ſhe could do no leſſe than write unto him. By no means, anſwered ſhe, too many of my Letters has made him thus preſumptuous. At laſt when I could obtain no more from her: ſhe permitted me to lap up a piece of paper in the manner of a Letter, and to put it into <hi>Flurialls</hi> Petition; ſo he to carry it unto him, and this purpoſely, that <hi>Fluriall</hi> might not perceive this diſſention: Oh, how <hi>Lindamor</hi> was amazed, when he opened this blank paper; but the greateſt affliction to him was, that he muſt depart in the morning betimes, unto a place, where the affairs of <hi>Amaſis</hi> and <hi>Clida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> did of neceſſity oblige him to ſtay a long time: to defer his journey he could not, and to go upon theſe tearmes was even death unto him. At laſt, he reſolved to diſpatch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Letter to her preſently, more as a thing of hazard, than any hopes of good fortune. <hi>Fluriall</hi> did his beſt indeavour to deliver it preſently unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> but he could not do it, becauſe ſhe being extreamly vexed at this fraction, was forced to go into her bed, and did not riſe out of it many daies. <hi>Fluriall</hi> ſeeing <hi>Lindamor</hi> was gone, took upon him ſo much boldneſſe, as to go into her Chamber; and becauſe I was, I muſt confeſſe, an ill-willer unto <hi>Polemas,</hi> I uſed my beſt invention, to piece up this affection between <hi>Lindamor</hi> and her, and therefore gave <hi>Fluriall</hi> an opportunity to enter. Judge you, whether or no <hi>Galathea</hi> was ſurpriſed when ſhe ſaw him, for ſhe expected nothing leſſe then this; yet, ſhe was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſet a good face upon the matter, and to take what he preſented unto her, which in appearance was only a Poſie of flowers. I would by all means be preſent, that I might put in the beſt advice I could in the behalfe of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and certainly my being there, was not unprofitable to him; for after <hi>Fluriall</hi> was gone, and <hi>Galathea</hi> was alone, ſhe called me unto her, and told me, that ſhe had thought not to be any more troubled with Letters from <hi>Lindamor,</hi> now he was gone; but, for ought ſhe ſaw, he was as impudent as ever. I, who was a reall well-wiſher unto <hi>Lindamor,</hi> though he knew it not, ſeeing the Nymph in an humour of talking to me, did ſeem to be very ſlack in the buſineſſe, knowing, that to contradict her at the firſt, was the way to ſpoile all, and that to ſooth her in all ſhe ſaid was the only way to bend her: And though ſhe was much diſpleaſed at him, yet Love was ſtill the moſt predominant in her minde, and ſhe her ſelfe was glad that I took <hi>Lindamor's</hi> part, that ſhe might have occaſion of talking of him, and give the anger of her ſoul ſome vent: So as having all theſe conſiderations in my minde, I was ſilent when ſhe talked of him; at laſt, ſhe not being pleaſed at my ſilence, ſaid thus unto me: <hi>Leonida,</hi> what do you think of the preſumption of this man? Madam, ſaid I unto her, I know not what no ſay or think, farther then this, that if he have offended, he will be extreamly ſorry for it. But what can I think of his raſh impudency, ſaid ſhe? has he no other ſubject for his diſcourſe but me? Then (looking upon the Letter which he writ) were it not a madneſſe in me, if I ſhould ſuffer him to continue his Letters unto me? To this I anſwered nothing. And when ſhe ſaw me a long while ſilent, ſhe ſaid thus unto me, What's the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Leonida,</hi> you do not anſwer me? have I not good reaſon for all my complaints? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid I unto her, will you give me leave to ſpeak my minde freely? With all my heart, ſaid ſhe. Then ſaid I unto her, I muſt tell you, that I think you to be reaſonable in all things, but in looking for reaſon in Love, for you muſt know, that to reduce Love unto the Lawes of juſtice and reaſon, is to take away its principall prerogative, which is to be a ſubject only unto its ſelfe; ſo as I conclude, that if <hi>Lindamor</hi> have failed in matter of Loving you, he is to blame; but if he have failed only againſt the Lawes of reaſon and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, then it is you that deſerve to be puniſhed, for offering to bring Love, which is free, and commands all others, under the ſervitude of a Superior. But why ſaid ſhe, I have heard, that if Love be laudable, it is vertuous, and if ſo, then it is ſubject unto the Lawes of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Love, anſwered I, is above that vertue whereof you ſpeak, and gives Lawes unto it ſelf, without any ſubſerviency unto any: But, Madam, ſince you command me to ſpeak freely, I beſeech you tell me, are not you more culpable than he is of that whereof you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him, and of matter of Love? For ſay he were ſo bold as to tell it, that he loved you,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53526:73"/>
you your ſelfe is the cauſe of it, ſince you permitted him. Though I had, anſwered ſhe; yet out of diſcretion, he ſhould have concealed it. Then, ſaid I, complain of his indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not of his Love; but, believe me, he hath more occaſion to complain againſt your love, ſince upon the very firſt report, and before you can juſtly tax his affection, you have repulſed that Love he bore unto you. Excuſe, Madam, the freedome of my language, if I tell you, that you do him the greateſt wrong in the world, in treating him thus, and condemning him before he have anſwered for himſelfe, and is convinced of his crime. She ſtayed a good while before ſhe anſwered, and at laſt ſaid thus unto me, Well <hi>Leonida,</hi> there is time enough to make him amends when he returnes; not that I am in any minde to love him, or let him love me, but then I ſhall tell him wherein he is faulty, and in that, ſatisfie you, and oblige him to trouble me nomore, unleſſe he be impudence itſelfe. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, Madam, ſaid I unto her, you may deceive your ſelfe, in thinking that his return will be time enough for all this; for, did you but know the violencies of Love, you would never think delaies unto a Lover ſo tolerable as unto others; therefore the leaſt you can do, is to ſee his Letter. That is to no purpoſe, anſwered ſhe; But, to ſatisfie you, give it me. Upon this, ſhe took it, and found it thus penned.</p>

               <p>This alteration in <hi>Galathea's</hi> courage, was an effect of Love; for I plainly perceived her heart to melt, but withall, it was no ſmall argument of her high ſpirit for, ſince ſhe would not give any knowledge of it unto me, and not being able to hold her countenance, which grew pale, ſhe did ſo tie up her tongue, that ſhe did not utter one word, which did argue any inclination to bend, but went out of her Chamber into the Garden, and ſpake not one ſyllable of this Letter: for the Sun began to grow low, and her maladie, which was a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of the minde, might better divert and ſolace it ſelfe abroad, than in bed; ſo as after ſhe had ſleightly dreſſed herſelfe, ſhe went into the Garden, and would have none but me with her: I asked her, by the way, whether ſhe pleaſed to return any anſwer unto his Letter?

It was now above a Month ſince <hi>Fluriall</hi> went, when there arrived a Knight armed <hi>Cap a pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and a Herauld of Armes with him; and the better to diſguiſe himſelfe, his face was covered. The Herauld at the Gates of the Town, deſired to be conducted unto <hi>Amaſis;</hi> and every one, out of curioſity to hear what newes, went along with him. The Guards of the Town did let them in, and after <hi>Amaſis</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, they were conducted unto her, who had ſent for <hi>Clidaman</hi> to entertain theſe ſtrangers: After the Knight had made a low Reverence unto <hi>Amaſis,</hi> and kiſſed the hand of <hi>Clidaman,</hi> the Herauld ſpoke theſe words in a kinde of a ſtrange language: Madam, this Knight whom you ſee here, being one of the higheſt qualitie in all his Country, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that any man of honour, might freely demand ſatisfaction of any that ſhould wrong him he comes here to ask the ſame favour from you, which you never denyed unto any, which is, to permit him in your preſence, and in preſence of all theſe fair Nymphs, to draw a ſatisfaction from the man that hath injured him, by ſuch waies, as are allowed unto perſons of his qualitie. <hi>Amaſis,</hi> after a little conſideration with herſelfe, returned this anſwer, That it was true, this way of defending honour had ever been the cuſtom of her Court; but ſhe, being a woman, never permitted any to try the matter by Armes: yet notwithſtanding, her Son being now at an age able to decide a greater buſineſſe than this, ſhe would refer it wholly unto him. <hi>Clidaman</hi> never ſtaying for the Herauld's reply, ſaid thus unto her: Madam, this is the way, not only to be honoured by all thoſe who inhabit in thoſe Provinces, over which the gods have placed you the great Lady, but it is alſo moſt juſt to puniſh ſuch as are faulty, and to honour ſuch as do deſerve it; and the beſt way of all, is that of Armes, eſpeciallly in ſuch caſes, as cannot otherwiſe be decided: ſo as if you do not allow of this moſt juſt way of diſcovering the villanies of wicked men, you will encourage all wickedneſſe, and baſe men will not care what villany they commit, ſo they can do it ſecretly. Moreover, theſe ſtrangers, who are the firſt that ever had recourſe unto you, would have great reaſon to complain, if they ſhould be the firſt that are refuſed and denied juſtice: And therefore, ſince you are pleaſed to refer the buſineſſe unto me. I ſhall give this Knight free liberty, to accuſe and defie whom he will, and will promiſe him a fair tryall in the field. The Knight then kneeled down, kiſſed his hand, and gave him humble thanks. Sir, ſaid he, ſince you are ſo noble, I muſt acquaint you, that the Knight I am in queſt of, his name is <hi>Polemas,</hi> whom I beſeech you to produce, that I may accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh my end that I came for. <hi>Polemas</hi> hearing himſelfe named, ſtepped forward, and in his lofty garb, ſaid, Who is he that is in queſt of me? I am the man he looks for. Then the unknowne Knight went to him, and gave him his Gauntlet, and the Herauld ſaid, Sir, this Knight preſents that unto you as a gage, promiſing, that tomorrow morning by Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe he will meet you, and prove, that you have moſt villanouſly invented all thoſe lyes which you have ſpoken of him. Herauld, ſaid <hi>Polemas,</hi> I do accept the gage, and though I do not know this Knight, yet I am certain to have juſtice on my ſide, ſince I am ſure, that I never ſaid any thing againſt Truth, and let tomorrow be the day to try it. Then the Knight, after a low reverence unto <hi>Amaſis</hi> and all the Ladies, went unto his Tent, that he had cauſed to be ſet up without the Gates of the Town. You may well imagine, how this filled all the Court with diſcourſe, eſpecially <hi>Amaſis</hi> and <hi>Clidaman,</hi> who loved <hi>Polemas</hi> very well, and were very ſorry to ſee him in this danger; however, a promiſe had obliged them to allow the field. As for <hi>Polemas,</hi> he, like a man of great courage, prepared himſelfe for Combat, not knowing his enemy. And for <hi>Galathea,</hi> who had almoſt forgotten the injury that <hi>Polemas</hi> had done unto <hi>Lindamor,</hi> ſhe thinking, that he did not know his harm came from thence, ſhe never thought of <hi>Lindamor,</hi>
nor I neither, who thought him to be a hundred miles off; and yet it was he, who having received my Letter, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53526:74"/>
to ſeek revenge this way. But to be ſhort, for I am no good fighter, and therefore can make but a bad relation of the Combat; but let me tell you as well as I can, that after a long Combat, wherein both ſides had equall advantages, and both of them ſo full of wounds, that death was much more likely to be both their ſhares, than life, inſomuch as every one began to pitty the loſſe of two ſuch valiant men, <hi>Amaſis</hi> told <hi>Clidaman,</hi> that it was beſt to part them, and none could be thought more fit for it, than <hi>Galathea;</hi> ſhe being alſo much moved unto pitty, was glad to do the good office, and ſo with three or foure of us, ſhe went into the liſts: When ſhe firſt entred, the victory ſeem'd to incline more unto <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and <hi>Polemas</hi> was reduced into ſuch a bad condition, as he was almoſt quite ſpent. Unto <hi>Lindamor</hi> ſhe addreſſed her ſelfe, and pulling him by the Scarfe which hung behinde him ſhe drew him a little back: When he felt himſelf touched, he turned ſuddenly about, thinking he was betrayed, &amp; with ſuch fury, as the Nymph recoyling, for fear of being hurt, was intangled in her Gown, and fell in the midſt of the Liſts. <hi>Lindamor,</hi> who knew her, ran preſently to take her up: But <hi>Polemas,</hi> without regard unto the Nymph ſeeing this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, gave <hi>Lindamor</hi> two or three ſuch blowes upon the head behind, as made him ſtoop to the ground; but he got up again ſo incenſed againſt his enemy, that maugre all <hi>Galathea's</hi> prayers, he would not leave him, till he laid him under his feet: then getting upon him, he diſarmed his head, and when he was ready to give him his diſpatching blow, he heard the voice of his adored Lady crying out, Oh Knight, I do conjure you by her whom you love moſt, to give me the life of this Knight. I will, ſaid <hi>Lindamor</hi> unto her, upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he will confeſſe, that he hath falſly reported things of me, and of her, by whom you conjure me. <hi>Polemas</hi> being as he thought, at the laſt gaſp of life, did confeſſe what they would. Thus <hi>Lindamor</hi> got the day, and went away, after he had kiſſed the hand of his Miſtris, who knew him not, though he ſpoke unto her, his Helmet, and her own fears, kept her from taking any notice of his voice; but, as he paſſed by me, he ſaid thus unto me in a low voice, Fair <hi>Leonida.</hi> I am too much obliged to you to conceal my ſelfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſee the effect of your Letter. Then without any more ſtay, he got on Horſeback, though much wounded, and galloped preſently out of ſight: this over-much ſtirring of his body by riding, did him much hurt, and brought him to that extreamity, that being come into the houſe of <hi>Eluriall's</hi> Aunt, where he reſolved to lodge, in caſe he was wounded, he was ſo weak, that it was three weeks before he could ſtirr out of his bed. In the mean time, <hi>Galathea</hi> was extreamly angry with this unknown Knight, for not leaving the Combat when firſt ſhe deſired him, being more offended at his refuſall, than obliged by what he had given her. And <hi>Polemas</hi> being, as you know of a high rank, <hi>Amaſis</hi> and <hi>Clidaman</hi> cauſed him with much griefe to be carried off the field, and dreſſed with all poſſible care, inſomuch as they began to be in ſome hopes of his life.</p>
               <p>Every one was extreamly deſirous to know who this unknown Knight was, whoſe cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and valour had got him the eſteem of very many; <hi>Galathea</hi> was the only perſon that had an ill opinion of him: for this proud Beauty remembred the offence, and forgot the courteſie; and becauſe it was to me only, that ſhe uſed to vent her moſt ſecret thoughts, aſſoon as ſhe ſaw me in private with her: Do you know this diſcourteous Knight, ſaid ſhe unto me, unto whom Fortune, and not his Valour, hath given the advantage of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat? Madam, ſaid I, I do know him to be both a valiant and a courteous Knight. He has not ſhew'd it in this action, ſaid ſhe; for if he had, he would have left fighting at my firſt requeſt. Madam, anſwered I, you do blame him for that, which you ought to eſteem him for, ſince in doing honour unto you, he thereby was in danger of his life. But, ſaid ſhe, he would not leave ſighting when I deſired him. Had he not all the reaſon in the world, ſaid I unto her, to chaſtiſe the baſe act of <hi>Polemas,</hi> who would not firſt ceafe: for my part, I think he did very well, and <hi>Lindamor</hi> could not in honour do leſs then he did. How, ſaid ſhe, was it <hi>Lindamor</hi> who fought? The truth is, I was ſorry that I had unawares named him, but ſeeing it was out, I thought beſt to tell her; Yes, Madam, (ſaid I) it was <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor,</hi> who being offended at the report of <hi>Polemas,</hi> would try the truth of them by Armes. She was extreamly aſtoniſhed at it, and after ſhe had awhile conſidered upon this accident, ſhe ſaid thus unto me; Then I ſee it is <hi>Lindamor</hi> who hath done me this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteſie, that is ſo ſhallow in his reſpects unto me: Was he ſo inconſiderate, as to put my Honour to the hazard of Fortune and Armes? Upon this ſhe was ſilent, and extreamly vexed. And I, who would by any means make her know, that <hi>Lindamor</hi> was in no fault, did thus anſwer her; Is it poſſible, Madam, that you ſhould thus complain againſt <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and not ſee the wrong you do your ſelfe? What diſcourteſy has he done you? Has he not
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53526:74"/>
vanquiſhed <hi>Polemas</hi> your enemy? How, my enemy, (ſaid ſhe) <hi>Lindamor</hi> is much more for he gave <hi>Polemas</hi> the firſt cauſe. Oh heavens, Madam, ſaid I then unto her, what do you mean? <hi>Lindamor</hi> more your enemy, who has no ſoul but to adore you, nor one drop of blood that he would not ſpend in your ſervice? And can he be more your friend, who by his ſubtle diſcourſe endeavours to ſtain your honour? But <hi>Leonida,</hi> replied ſhe, Who knowes whether <hi>Lindamor,</hi> out of his accuſtomed arrogance and pride, did not ſpeak thoſe words, wherwith <hi>Polemas</hi> did tax him. But Madam, anſwered I, how much are you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged unto <hi>Lindamor,</hi> for making your enemy confeſſe, that he did invent them? Oh Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I beſeech you pardon me, if I do accuſe you of great ingratitude, when <hi>Lindamor</hi> hazzards his life, to make it appear <hi>Polemas</hi> lyed: You accuſe him of inconſideration, and his making the Lyar to confeſſe his Lye; you tax him with diſcourteſie: Had he not taken himſelfe to Armes, how ſhould the truth ever have appeared? and had he left fighting when firſt you commanded him, <hi>Polemas</hi> had then never confeſſed what you and every one heard. Ah, poor <hi>Lindamor,</hi> how I pitty thy fortune? What canſt thou poſſibly do to pleaſe, ſince the moſt ſignal ſervices are looked upon as offences and crimes. Well, well, Madam, perhaps you will not have long to uſe theſe cruelties; for I beleeve, death, more pittifull than you, will put an end unto your ingratitude and his torments; and may be, at this very hour he is dead, which if he be, then the Nimph, <hi>Galathea,</hi> is the cauſe of it. Why do you accuſe me? (ſaid ſhe.) Becauſe, replied I, when you went to part them, and fell upon the ground, he helped you up, and in the mean while the courteous <hi>Polemas</hi> whom you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol ſo highly, did moſt baſely wound him in two or three places; and I ſaw <hi>Lindamors</hi> blood run upon the ground after it; but if he doe die upon it, it is the leaſt evil he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from you for, to be ſcorned after ſo much duty, is, me-thinks, a miſery never equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But, Madam, I pray remember, the time was, you ſaid there was no way to ſtop theſe reports of <hi>Polemas,</hi> but by ſword and blood: He has done what you deemed the beſt, and yet you muſt needs tax him for doing ill. Had not <hi>Sylvia,</hi> and ſome other Nymphs interrupted us, I beleeve I ſhould have ſomewhat tempered the animoſity of this Nymph: But ſeeing ſo much company coming in, we changed diſcourſe; yet my words were not without their effect, though ſhe would not make it appear unto me; but yet I ſaw it by a thouſand ſymptomes. For ſince that day, I reſolved to ſpeak unto her no more, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſhe firſt asked me. She on the other ſide expected that I ſhould begin: And thus eight dayes paſſed, and not a word paſſed betwixt us of this buſineſs. In the mean time, <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> was not without his cares, to know what reports went of him at Court, and what <hi>Galathea</hi> thought. He ſent <hi>Flurial</hi> unto me upon the ſame buſineſs, and to bring me a ſhort Letter: And <hi>Flurial</hi> was ſo ingenuous, that he did his buſineſs, and <hi>Galathea</hi> never took any notice of it. The Letter was this.</p>

               <p>I enquired very particularly of <hi>Flurial</hi> how he did, and whether any knew him: I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood he had loſt much blood, and that did moſt retard his cure, but that he was not in any danger. I perceived he could not be known, becauſe his Herald was a <hi>Frank</hi> of <hi>Mero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>'s Army, far off; and thoſe about, were not permitted to ſtir out of the houſe: And that <hi>Flurials</hi> Aunt knew no more of him but that he was the unknown Knight that fought with <hi>Polemas,</hi> whoſe valour and bounty, made them all very diligent about him. Alſo that he had commanded <hi>Flurial</hi> to come and know of me, how reports went at Court, and what he ſhould do. I commanded him to tell <hi>Lindamor,</hi> that all the Court was full of his valour, though he was unknown; that he ſhould reſt himſelfe, and have a care of his cure, and that I would ſtudy his contentment as much as I could: But, I told him, it was convenient before he went, 'to ask <hi>Galathea's</hi> leave, pretending to ſee his Aunt. So
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53526:75"/>
the next morning when <hi>Galathea</hi> was in the Garden, <hi>Flurial</hi> made a low reverence unto her, and offered to ſpeak with her: But <hi>Galathea,</hi> thinking it was to deliver ſome Letter unto her from <hi>Lindamor,</hi> was ſo confuſed, as ſhe grew as pale as death it ſelfe: and, leſt <hi>Flurial</hi> ſhould take any notice of this alteration in her face, I ſtepped forward and ſaid unto her, Madam it is <hi>Flurial</hi> who hath been with his Aunt that is ſick and beſeecheth you will be pleaſed to give him leave to go againe unto her for ſome certain dayes. <hi>Galathea</hi> then turned towards me and asked what ſhe was ſicke of: and I anſwered, that it was a diſeaſe of many yeares continuance, and ſuch a one as was out of all hopes of any cure. Then ſhe addreſſed her ſelfe unto <hi>Flurial</hi> and ſaid unto him. Go <hi>Flurial</hi> &amp; return again asſoon as you can, but not before your Aunt be recovered, for I ever loved her very well, for her conſtant good affection to me, Then ſhe continued on her walk, I talked with him and ſeemed as if I were diſpleaſed, though I was not, that the Nymph might take notice of me: but ſaid I unto him be ſure <hi>Flurial,</hi> thou beeſt both ſecret and prudent; for there upon depends either thy happineſs or thy ruine; &amp; above al be ſure thou doſt, whatſoever <hi>Lindamor</hi> commands thee: after a promiſe of al fidelity, he went away, &amp; I began to put on a face of extream ſorrow: And when I was in any place; where, the Nymph might heare me, I would ſeem to ſigh, lift my hands pu to heaven, &amp; clap them both together; &amp; uſed all the geſtures I could poſſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, to ſeeme the moſt grieved ſoul that ever breathed. She hearing me often mention <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor</hi> untomy ſelf, &amp; never ſo much as name him unto her, but on the contrary did ſhun all occaſions of it; and in lieu of that frolique humour I uſed in all company, to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a lump of melancholy, ſhe began by degrees to be of that opinion I wiſhed, but not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for my deſign was to make her beleeve, that <hi>Lindamor,</hi> as he went off from the combate, was ſo wounded that he dyed, to the end that pitty might obtaine from this proud ſoul, what affection and ſervice could not. Now my plot was ſo handſomly carried, that it took almoſt according to my wiſh for though ſhe ſet as good a face upon it as ſhe could, yet ſhe was touched to the very quick for <hi>Lindamor.</hi> So as perceiving me thus mute and ſad, ſhe imagined him to be very ill, or worſe; and was ſo extreamly troubled in this conceipt that ſhe was not able to hold any longer.</p>
               <p>Two dayes after <hi>Flurial</hi> was gone, ſhe called me into her cloſſet, and ſeeming to talk of ſomething elſe, ſhe asked me, whether I knew how <hi>Flurials</hi> Aunt did? I anſwered, that ſince he went I heard nothing. Truly, ſayes ſhe, I ſhould be very ſorry if that good old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould dye. You have reaſon Madam, ſaid I unto her, for ſhe ever loved you and was alwaies very ſerviceable to you. If ſhe live, anſwered <hi>Galathea,</hi> I ſhal requite her; and if ſhe die I ſhall love <hi>Furial</hi> for her ſake. Then I anſwered that indeed it was very true, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices both of the Aunt and Nephew deſerved recompence, eſpecially <hi>Flurial,</hi> for his fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and affection could not be corrupted. 'Tis very true, ſaid ſhe: but for <hi>Flurial,</hi> what long and ſad diſcourſe was that which you had with him when he went away? I anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a faint and ſad tone, nothing but deſired him to commend me to his Aunt. Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, ſaid ſhe, do not uſe to be ſo long. Then ſhe came neare me, and laying her hand upon my ſhoulder, Tel me truly, ſaid ſhe, did you talke of nothing elſe? What ſhould I talke of elſe except that, replyed I; for I have no other buſineſſe with him? Now do I know, ſaid ſhe, that you do diſſemble. Why do you ſay, you have no other buſineſſe with him? have you none that concernes <hi>Lindamor?</hi> Oh Madam, ſaid I, I did not think, you could have any memorie now of one that was ſo unfortunate; then ſtanding in a ſilentand dejected poſture, I ſighed very profundly two or three times. What is it, ſaid ſhe, that cauſeth you to ſigh thus? Tell me truly, where is <hi>Lindamor? Lindamor,</hi> ſaid I, alas, he is not now a man of this world. How, cryed ſhe out, is <hi>Lindamor</hi> dead? Yes certainly, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered I, and your cruelty did kill him more then the blowes of his enemy. For going off from the combate, and knowing by ſeverall reports how ill you were ſatisfied with him, he would never ſuffer himſelfe to be dreſſed; and if you will needs know it, this was the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe I had with <hi>Flurial,</hi> whom I commanded to try, if he could handſomly get away thoſe Letters which you have written unto him, that you might burn them, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of him both together. Oh my god, ſaid ſhe then unto me, what ſad ſtory is this you tell me? is it poſſible he ſhould be thus loſt? you ſhould have ſaid, replyed I, that it was your ſelfe that kil'd him, and that it is you that has the loſſe: for as for him, he is a gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by his death, &amp; he finds that reſt there which your cruelty would never let him enjoy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. Ah <hi>Leonida</hi> ſaid ſhe, I hope all this is onely to vex me, Tel me truly, is he alive? I would he were, anſwered I, but why ſhould you be ſo inquiſitive? I am ſure life and death was both a like indifferent to you. And ſince your love to him was ſo little, me thinks you ſhould
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53526:75"/>
be glad to be rid of that trouble which he was unto you. For you muſt think that had he lived he would have been perpetually giving you ſuch teſtimonies of his affection, as this with <hi>Polemas</hi> was. Truly, ſaid the Nimph, then I do moſt heartily lament the loſs of poor <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and ſwear unto you, that his death wounds me deeper than I could have belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it would. But tell me, had he no remembrance of us at his laſt end? And did hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs no ſorrows to leave us? This queſtion, Madam, ſaid I unto her, is ſomthing ſtrange; he dyed for the love of you, and yet you ask, whether he had you in his memory? Alaſs, alaſs, his memory, and his ſorrows, were too much for his health; but I beſeech you let us talk no more of him: I am confident he is in a place where he receives the wages of his fidelity and where, perhaps, he will ſee revenge upon you. You are angry, ſaid ſhe unto me. I beſeech you pardon me, Madam, ſaid I unto her. I have ſome reaſon for what I ſay; for there is none can give a better teſtimony of his affection and fidelity than my ſelf, and of your ingratitude wherewith you have recompenced ſo many ſervices. Let us leave that, anſwered the Nymph; for I do acknowledge you are in the right but I beſeech you by the affection you have unto me, to tell me whether he had any remembrance of me in his laſt ſpeech? and what words he uſed? Will you needs triumph, Madam, in his laſt breath, ſaid I, as you have in all the reſt of his life? If you would I will give you full ſatisfaction. As ſoon as ever he heard, that you did endeavour by your words to blemiſh the honour of his Victory, and that in lieu of pleaſing you by his Combat, he had gotten your hatred, he pulled off all clothes that lapped his wounds, and leaving them all open, hee would never ſuffer the hand of any Chirurgeon to come near them. His wounds were not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; but when they were putrified, ſo ſoon as he felt he could not live any longer, he called for <hi>Flurial,</hi> and when he was alone with him, he ſaid thus; <hi>Flurial,</hi> my good friend, thou muſt now loſe one that had a deſire to doe thee ſome good, but thou muſt arm thy ſelf with patience, ſince it is the will of heaven. I would requeſt one peece of ſervice more from thee, which is the beſt thou ever didſt me: And having got a faithful promiſe from him that hee would doe it, he went on with his diſcourſe. As ſoon as ever I am dead, open my breaſt, take out my heart, carry it unto the fair <hi>Galathea,</hi> and tell her, I ſent it, to the end, that after my death I may not retain any thing which was not my own. As as ſoon ever theſe words were ſpoken, he loſt both ſpeech and life. Now this fool <hi>Flurial,</hi> in performance of his promiſe unto him he loved ſo dearly, brought hither the heart of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and, but for me, would have preſented it unto you. Ah <hi>Leonida,</hi> ſaid ſhe then, is it certain he is dead? Oh heavens, I ſhould never know of his ſickneſs? Would none tel me of it? Oh <hi>Leonida,</hi> you were much too blame. Madam, anſwered I I did not know any thing of it; for <hi>Flurial</hi> ſtayed all the while with him becauſe he brought none of his own ſervants with him: But if I had known of it, I think I ſhould never have acquainted you, ſince I knew you to be ſo averſe unto any thing that came from him. Then leaning her head upon her arm, ſhe commanded me to leave her by her ſelf, as I think, that I might not ſee her tears, which began already to trickle from her eyes: Yet I was no ſooner gone, but ſhe called me back, and never looking up, bade me command <hi>Flurial</hi> to bring what <hi>Lindamor</hi> had ſent unto her; for ſhe would by any means have it. Then I went out in ſure hopes that my plot would take effect according to my expected deſires. Mean while, when <hi>Flurial</hi> was returned unto <hi>Lindamor,</hi> he found him full of impatient longing for him, but my Letter gave him full ſatisfaction. It was thus penned.</p>

               <p>My anſwer in ſhort was, becauſe I will not trouble you with too many Letters, that as ſoon as he found himſelf able to travail, he ſhould finde ſome way or other to come and ſpeak with me; and as briefly as I could I let him underſtand all the diſcourſe between <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathea</hi> and me; alſo how ſhe reſented the news of his death, and deſired to have his Heart. But obſerve the force of a great affection: <hi>Lindamor,</hi> that had ſo many ſeverall wounds, and loſt ſo much blood, as did narrowly endanger his life; yet, beyond all hopes of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons, aſſoon as he received my laſt Letter, he did riſe out of his bed, dreſſed himſelfe, and within two or three dayes after got on Horſeback to come unto me; and becauſe he durſt not come by day, for fear of being ſeen, he put himſelfe into the habit of a Gardiner, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelfe Couſen unto <hi>Fluriall,</hi> and reſolved to come into the Garden, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelfe as occaſion ſhould require: Telling the Aunt of <hi>Fluriall,</hi> that he had made a vow before the Combat, and muſt needs go and perform it, before he went out of the Country; and fearing the friends of <hi>Rolemas,</hi> he diſguiſed himſelfe in ſuch a habit, and deſired her not to ſpeak of it: The good old woman would have diſſwaded him, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to defer his voyage untill another time. But he being inflamed with zealous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, told her, that if he did not perform it before he went out of the Country, he ſhould think himſelfe ſubject unto all the curſes of all the gods. So to prevent meeting with any, he went in the night, and came ſo happily into the Garden, as he was unſeen of any. <hi>Fluriall</hi> carried him into the houſe, in which there was then none but a drudge that helped him to dig, whom he made believe that <hi>Lindamor</hi> was his Cozen, whom he would teach the trade of a Gardiner. Thus <hi>Lindamor</hi> expected the morning with a longing deſire, and the night ſeemed longer than ordinary unto him, that waited for effecting his deſires. Morning was no ſooner come, but <hi>Lindamor</hi> was in the Garden with a ſpade in his hand: Had you but ſeen him with this tool in his hand, and how aukwardly he handled it, you would have known, that he was not much verſed in it, but knew better how to wield a Spear than a Spade; and I have heard him ſince ſwear a hundred times, that he was never in all his life ſo aſhamed, as when he did preſent himſelfe before his Miſtreſſe in that habit, and that he was in two or three mindes, whether he ſhould return or no: but at laſt, Love ſurmounted the ſhame, and kept him there untill we came.</p>
               <p>As fortune was, the Nymph came that day into the Garden, with many of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panious; aſsoon is ſhe ſpied <hi>Flurial,</hi> ſhe trembled like an Aſpen leaf, and caſt her eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, but though I endeavoured to ſpeak with him, yet I could not, becauſe this new Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner was ſo neer him, who was ſo altered in his habit, that none of us knew him. As for me; I might as well as any of the reſt be excuſed, for ſince he never acquainted me with his deſigne, I ſhould never have believed he would have attempted it, untill he had firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me; but he has ſince told me, that he did conceal it from me, becauſe he knew I would not have permitted him to come thither in that manner. Dreaming then of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than him, I did as inquiſitivly ask <hi>Flurial</hi> who this ſtranger was, as any in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and he anſwered me in a faint voice, that he was his Aunts ſon, whom he intended to inſtruct in the trade of Gardening. Upon this anſwer, <hi>Galathea,</hi> as inquiſitive, but not ſo couragious, as I, ſeeing me in diſcourſe with him, came to us, and hearing that he was <hi>Fluriall's</hi> Oozen, did ask him how his Mother did? Now was <hi>Lindamor</hi> put to his ſhifts, fearing leaſt his tongue, though not his habit, ſhould betray him; yet, counterfeiting his Tone as well as he could, he anſwered in a Country-like language. That, bleſſed be God, ſhe was now paſt the worſt, and then made ſuch a Leg, ſo like his Language, that all the Nymphs could not chuſe but laugh: but he ſeeming to take no notice of them, nor ſtirring his cap, but giving it a ſcurvy remove with both his hands, he fell ill-favour'dly to his work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Galathea,</hi> in a ſmiling manner, told <hi>Fluriall,</hi> that if his Conſen were as good a Gardiner, as he was an Oratour, he would be very uſefull unto him. Madam, ſaid <hi>Fluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:53526:76"/>
he can ſpeak no better than he was taught; Country people all ſpeak ſo, Yes, yes, ſaid the Nymph, and perhaps he is held for a prime fellow amongſt them. After this, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to her walk. This gave me an opportunity of talking to <hi>Flurial,</hi> for my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions were all got about <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and every one had their queſtions to him, unto which he anſwered, but ſo ill-favour'dly, that he forced them all to laugh, for it was in ſuch a manner, as made them all believe he was in good earneſt; and though he did anſwer unto every queſtion, yet hee never ſtirred his cap nor head, but ſeemed very intent upon his work. In the mean time, I asked <hi>Flurial,</hi> how <hi>Lindamor</hi> did And he anſwered, that truly he was yet very ill; for <hi>Lindamor</hi> had commanded him to tell me ſo. But where lies his ſickneſſe, ſaid I unto him, for thou ſayeſt, his wounds are almoſt whole? You will know, Madam, ſaid he unto me, by this Letter which he hath writ unto my Lady. His Lady, anſwered I, hath an opinion that he is dead, but give me the Letter, and I will carry it unto her. I dare not indeed Madam, anſwered he, for he hath expreſly forbidden me, and tyed me unto it by an Oath. How, ſaid I does <hi>Lindamor</hi> miſtruſt me? No, ſaid ſhe, but on the contrary, deſires you to make the Nymph ſtill believe that he is dead: But, it will be both advantageous unto him and me, that I do deliver it with my own hands. I was now very angry with him, and had continued in longer diſcourſe with him, had I not feared notice would have been taken: Yet, I could get nothing more out of him; but for a concluſion, the Nymph muſt receive it from his hand: But when I told him, that he had been long with the Nymph, and he might have preſented the Letter unto her: He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered me only with a ſhake of his head, whereby I perceived, that he would not give it unto me. <hi>Galathea</hi> perceiving our long diſcourſe, and deſirous to know upon what ſubject it was, did leave her walk ſooner then uſuall, and calling me unto her, asked me what it was? I told her freely the reſolution of <hi>Fluriall;</hi> but, in lieu of the Letter, I told her it was the Heart of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and how he was ſworn to deliver it to none but her, unleſſe he ſhould betray the truſt of the dead. Then <hi>Galathea</hi> anſwered me he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it unto me, under colour of preſenting me with a Basket of Fruit, in which the Heart may be put in the bottome. I anſwered, that this might well be done; but I know, <hi>Fluriall</hi> the fool will deliver it with his own hands, in expectation of ſome reward for the ſervices he hath done you. Oh, ſaid ſhe, if that be all, let him ask what he will, and I will give it unto him. This, Madam, ſaid I, will ſeem a kinde of ranſome, with which you redeem the heart. No, no, anſwered ſhe, the Ranſome I am to pay for it, is Tears, and thoſe drawn from my hearts blood. Perhaps ſhe was ſorry for ſaying ſo much; but however, ſo it was, ſhe commanded me to ſpeak unto <hi>Flurial,</hi> which I did, and uſed all the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage I had to get this Letter from him, even as far as threatnings, but all in vain for he told me once for all, that neither heaven nor earth ſhould make him forſworn: If my Lady, ſaid he, will have it, let her come in the evening to the bottom of the back ſtaires which comes from her Chamber into the Garden, the Moon ſhines, the way is not ſo far, and I have known her come the ſame journey as late; when ſhe heares me, I am confident ſhe will allow of my reaſons. When I heard this, I was extreamly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at him, and told him, it was his duty to obey <hi>Galathea</hi> before <hi>Lindamor,</hi> that ſhe was his Miſtris, and that it was in her power to do him good or harm: and to be ſhort, that it was not likely ſhe would take ſo much paines for it: but he ſtill reſolutely told me thus; Nymph, it is not <hi>Lindamor</hi> whom I do obey in this; but it is my oath which I have vowed unto the gods; and if I cannot performe it, there is no, remedy; I can returne to the place from whence I came. When I ſaw him thus reſolute, I was almoſt out of all patience: for had I been acquainted with <hi>Lindamor's</hi> deſigne, ſince it was gone ſo far, doubtleſſe I ſhould have ſeconded him; but being ignorant of it, I thought <hi>Flurial</hi> ſo far from all reaſon, as I knew not what to ſay: At laſt, I returned to the Nymph with his anſwer, who was ſo extreamly angry at him, as ſhe could have found in heart to have turned him out of her Mothers ſervice, had I not hinted unto her the danger that might have enſued by his diſcovery. Three or foure daies paſſed thus, before the Nymph would be brought to do as <hi>Flurial</hi> deſired: At laſt, Love, that commands all, forced her to tell me in the morning, that ſhe had no reſt all night, that <hi>Lindamor's</hi> Ghoſt haunted her all the night, and told her, that it was the leaſt thing ſhe could do for his memory, to go down a pair of ſtairs, to get his heart out of the hands of another; and that I ſhould acquaint <hi>Fluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> ſhe would be there that night. Oh heavens! what joy was this unto the new Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he hath ſince told me, his heart was never in his life ſo ſwell'd with joy, as then; for he began to deſpair of his plot taking effect, and ſeeing the Nymph never came into the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53526:77"/>
Garden, he feared that ſhe knew him. But when <hi>Flurial</hi> acquainted him with the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution that was taken, this was ſuch a reſurrection of Love, as if one ſhould die to make another mourn, and revive to make them rejoyce. The night being come, and every one retired to their lodgings, the Nymph did put her ſelfe into her night dreſſe, and cauſing me to open the dore, ſhe went firſt; and, I ſwear, ſhe trembled ſo, that ſhe had much ado to go; ſhe told me, that ſhe had ſuch an unuſuall beating at her ſtomack, as took away all her ſtrength; whether it was her being in the dark without light, or her going out at an undue time, or her apprehenſion of <hi>Lindamor's</hi> heart, I know not; but whatſoever it was, ſhe was much unlike her ſelfe: At laſt, growing a little more confident, we came to the bottome of the ſtaires, where we preſently found <hi>Flurial,</hi> who had waited long for us: The Nymph went before, and going into a Jeſſemine Arbour, which was ſo cloſe, as to keep out the Moon-ſhine, or any ſight from the windowes of the houſe, ſhe began to ſay thus to <hi>Fluriall</hi> in a great rage: 'Tis very well, <hi>Flurial,</hi> are you grown ſo ſtiffe in your own opinions, that you will not do what I command you? Madam, anſwered he undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly, it was to obey you that I have failed in this, if it be a fault; for did not you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me, that I ſhould punctually do whatſoever <hi>Lindamor</hi> commanded me? Now, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, beſides your command, I am obliged by oath unto <hi>Lindamor,</hi> to put his heart into no hands but yours. Well, ſaid ſhe, and ſighed, where is his heart? Here Madam, ſaid he; if you pleaſe to come hither into this corner, you will better ſee it than where you are. When ſhe came to the place, ſhe ſaw a man ſtanding upon his feet, and without ſpeaking a word, bowed himſelfe unto her. Oh heavens! ſaid the Nymph, what's here? <hi>Flurial,</hi> ſee, here's a man. Madam, ſaid <hi>Flurial,</hi> and ſmiled, it is a heart that is preſented unto you. How? ſaid ſhe, a heart: Then would ſhe have run away for fear; but he took hold of her Gown, kiſſed it, and held her. I hearing theſe words, came neerer, and preſently knew him to be the ſame that <hi>Fluriall</hi> called Gozen. Upon a ſuddain I knew not what to think: I ſaw <hi>Galathea</hi> and I my ſelf with two men, the one of which was unknown unto us; ſo as we knew not what to do. Cry out, we durſt not; fly, <hi>Galathea</hi> could not; to put any hopes in our own ſtrength, we could not. At laſt, all I could do, was, to lay hold on his hand that held <hi>Galathea</hi> by the Gown, and not able to do more, I began to ſcratch and bite him, which I did ſo upon a ſuddain, that the firſt thing he ſaw was his hand bitten. Oh ſweet <hi>Leonida</hi> (ſaid he then unto me) how would you uſe your enemies, if you uſe your ſervants thus ſharply? Though I was almoſt quite out of my ſelfe, yet me thought I ſhould know that voice, and asked him, who he was? I am, ſaid he, one that comes to bring <hi>Lindamor's</hi> Heart unto this fair Nymph. Then kneeling down upon the ground, he thus addreſſed himſelfe unto her: I muſt needs confeſſe Madam, that this preſumption is great, but yet not equall unto that affection which produceth it. Here, Madam, is the heart of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> which I preſent unto you; I hope the preſent will finde as good a reception from the hand of the Donor, as from a ſtranger. But, if my diaſterous Fate do deny me that which Love doth promiſe me, having offended againſt a Divinity whom I only adore, then condemn this heart which here I do bring unto you, unto what cruell tortures you ſhall pleaſe; for, ſo his pain may pleaſe you, he will endure with contentment, ſince you do ordain it unto him. Now I knew him to be <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and <hi>Galathea</hi> alſo, but not without abundance of wonder to us both, to ſee at her foot him, whom ſhe thought dead; and I, in lieu of a Gardiner to finde a Cavalier, who yielded unto none in all the Country. Perceiving <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathea</hi> ſo ſurpriſed that ſhe could not ſpeak, I began to talk unto him, and ſaid: Is it ſo <hi>Lindamor,</hi> that you delight to ſurpriſe and affright Ladies? this is not an Art, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſuch a Cavalier as you profeſſe your ſelfe. I muſt needs confeſſe unto you, ſweet Nymph, ſaid he unto me, that it is not a becomming act of a Cavalier, but it is of a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and I am no leſſe. Love that inſtructs all, has taught me to be a Gardiner. Is it poſſible, Madam, ſaid he unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> that this extream affection which you have cauſed, ſhould beſo diſpleaſing unto you, as you muſt needs delight more in the death of him that owes it, then his life? Will not this heart I have brought, finde as good a reception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live as dead? But, if you will needs have me die, here's a Ponyard will do that, which no time can ever do, for it will put an end to all. The Nymph anſwered nothing unto all this, but ſaid, Oh <hi>Leonida,</hi> have you betrayed me? Upon this, ſhe went in to another Walk, where ſhe did ſit down; for ſhe was ſo much tranſported out of her ſelfe, as ſhe knew not what ſhe did. Then <hi>Lindamor</hi> did fall upon his knees again, and I went to her, and ſaid, Why Madam, do you ſay, I betrayed you? how can you accuſe me for this? I vow unto you, that I knew nothing of the buſineſſe: but it is <hi>Flurial</hi> that hath deceived us both.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53526:77"/>
But, I thank God, we are all deceived the better way. Thanks be to God, here that heart of <hi>Lindamor</hi> which <hi>Flurial</hi> promiſed; he is here alſo ready to do you any ſervice: And have you not good reaſon to be glad of this Treaſon? It would be over tedious to relate all our diſcourſe at this time: out at the concluſion, peace was made between all parties, and ſo, as this Love was tyed with a harder knot then ever it was before; but upon this condition, that he ſhould at this very houre depart unto the place, whither <hi>Amaſis</hi> and <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daman</hi> had ſent him. This departure went hard, yet obey he muſt; and ſo after a parting kiſſe of <hi>Galathea's</hi> fair hand, he went away, in full aſſurance to finde her the ſame he left her. But it would be impertinent to particularize every circumſtance: <hi>Lindamor</hi> returned to his charge, did his buſineſſe and with the permiſſion of <hi>Amaſis</hi> and <hi>Clidaman,</hi> returned unto <hi>Forreſts,</hi> where giving a good account of his Commiſſion, he was honoured and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed according to the merit of his vertue. But all this did not halfe ſo much revive his ſoul, as the favourable aſpect which this Nymph did afford him, who ever ſince his laſt departure ſo increaſed in affection to him, as <hi>Lindamor</hi> might well ſay ſhe did equall him in Love: And this Courtſhip came to that height, as one night, when they were in the Garden together, he did often move her for leave, to ask the conſent of <hi>Amaſis</hi> unto their Marriage, being confident, that ſo many ſervices as he had done, both unto her and her Son would invite her to grant him that favour. To which ſhe anſwered; You have more reaſon to doubt their good-will than your own merit; and be leſſe aſſured of your own deſervings, then my good will: But yet, I would not have you mention it unto them, till <hi>Clidaman</hi> be married I am younger than he and I may well ſtay ſo long. You may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, Madam, anſwered he, but ſo cannot the violence of my paſſion: But, if you will not grant me this remedy, yet grant me another, if your affection be ſuch as you ſay unto me. If I can without prejudice to my ſelfe, ſaid ſhe, I will. Then after he had kiſſed her hand; Madam, ſaid he unto her, Promiſe me, before <hi>Leonida</hi> and the gods, who are witneſſes of our diſcourſe, that you will be my Wife, as I do vow, by all that is ſacred, to be your Husband, and never look upon any other. <hi>Galathea</hi> was ſurpriſed at this, yet ſeeming as if it were by my perſwaſion, though indeed it was by her own affection, ſhe gave him that ſatisfaction, and ſwore unto him; upon condition, that <hi>Lindamor,</hi> to avoid ſuſpition, ſhould never return into the Garden, untill their Marriage was declared. Now was <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor</hi> the moſt contented man that ever was, being full of hopes, and wanted nothing but the promiſed concluſion of all his deſires. But Love, or rather Fortune, did moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly thwart him. Oh <hi>Lindamor,</hi> how vain are all thy purpoſed hopes? At that time <hi>Clidaman</hi> went with <hi>Guyemant,</hi> to try their fortunes in Armes, and went into <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovea's</hi> Army but though he went away ſecretly, yet was he quickly diſcovered. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Amaſis</hi> would not let him be there in that ſort, ſhe levied all the Forces ſhe could, to ſend unto him, and committed the charge of them unto <hi>Lindamor,</hi> conſtituting <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> the Governour under her in all the Provinces, untill her Son's return; and this ſhe did, as well to ſatisfie two ſuch eminent men, as to ſever them; for ſince <hi>Lindamor's</hi> return, they were alwaies jarring. <hi>Polemas</hi> was very well contented and <hi>Lindamor</hi> went not with an ill will: The one was glad he was to ſtay with his Miſtreſſe, and the other hoped by his ſervices ſo to oblige <hi>Amaſis,</hi> as to facilitate the way unto that happineſſe, which he aſpired unto. But <hi>Polemas</hi> finding himſelfe in disfavour of his Miſtreſſe, and that his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall had robbed him of all, he put no confidence in any of his ſervices or merits, but had recourſe unto cunning and artifice: In order to this, he procured the moſt crafty fellow that ever was of that trade, whom he acquainted with every one about the Court, ſhewed him in ſecret <hi>Amalis, Galathea, Silvia, Selires,</hi> my ſelfe, and all the reſt of the Nymphs; and did not only ſhew him their faces, but acquainted him with all the ſecrets which he knew betwixt any of them: And after a full information of all paſſages, he deſired him to take upon him to ſeem a great Druide, and a moſt learned Conjurer: He ſeated himſelfe in the great wood of <hi>Savignew,</hi> neer the pleaſant Gardens of Mount <hi>Briſon,</hi> and cloſe by a little River which runs through the Wood: He ſtayed ſome certain daies, giving himſelfe out to be the greateſt Diviner that ever was; inſomuch as his fame reached unto us, and <hi>Galathea</hi> went unto him to know her fortune. This crafty Impoſtor did know ſo well how to carry himſelfe, and delude others, with ſo many circumſtances and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as I muſt confeſſe, he deceived me as well as the reſt. The main aime and concluſion of all his craft was, to tell <hi>Galathea,</hi> that the influence of the heavens had given her choice of a great happineſſe, or a great miſery, and that it muſt be her own prudence that was to diſtinguiſh betwixt them; that both theſe two extreams did depend upon Love; that if
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53526:78"/>
ſhe contemned his advice, ſhe would be the moſt miſerable woman in the world: And on the contrary, the moſt happy, if ſhe followed his counſel. Then looking in her hand, and then her face, he ſaid unto her, Such a day when you are in <hi>Marcelles,</hi> you ſhall ſee a man clothed in ſuch a colour; if you marry him, you will be the moſt miſerable woman upon earth. Afterwards he ſhewed her in a glaſs, a certain place upon the banks of the River <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> and ſaid unto her, See here is the place, go unto it ſuch an hour and then and there you ſhall find a man, whom if you marry, will make you infinitely happy.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Climanthes</hi> (for that was this Conjurers name) had ſubtilly got knowledg of the day that <hi>Lindamor</hi> was to depart, and the colour of his clothes he would wear; and his deſign was, that <hi>Polemas</hi> under a colour of going to Hunt, ſhould goe unto the place which he had ſhewed her in the glaſs. Now hear, I beſeech you, how things hapned. <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor</hi> was clothed as <hi>Climanthes</hi> told her, and <hi>Galathea</hi> remembring it, was ſo aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſhe could not give him one word by way of any anſwer. Poor <hi>Lindamor</hi> thought it to bee his departure which made her ſo ſad, and ſo kiſſing her hand, hee went his wayes better contented than his fortune allowed him any reaſon for.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, the day approaching on which <hi>Climanthes</hi> told her ſhe ſhould meet with the man that would make her all happineſſe, upon the banks of the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> ſhee would not fully acquaint me with her deſign, but only ſaid ſhe would try whether the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of the <hi>Druide</hi> were true. So ſhee took with her onely <hi>Silvia</hi> and me, her Nurſe, and little <hi>Meril.</hi> The Nurſe was ſhe that moſt fortified her in opinion of theſe predictions, as commonly all old women are very ſuperſtitious in ſuch things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So as this Nymph ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the day that <hi>Climanthes</hi> told her of, ſhe prepared her ſelf the night before to goe unto that place, and in the morning dreſſed her ſelf to the beſt advantage ſhe could, and alſo commanded us to make our ſelves ready. Thus we went in a Chariot to the place appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, where being come at the very ſame hour that <hi>Climanthes</hi> named, we found a Shepheard almoſt drowned, whom the waves had caſt upon our ſide. This Shepheard was one <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> who accidentally was fallen into the River, and had doubtleſſe been drowned, if wee had not ſaved him: So <hi>Galathea</hi> apprehending him to bee the man that was to make her happy, began then to love him ſo, that ſhee would needs have us carry him in the Chariot unto the Palace, before he revived; for then the ſand and mud had ſo choaked him, that he looked as pale as death, and had no kind of motion or beauty in him. For my part, I cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Conjurer, and did foreſee we ſhould be put to abundance of trouble with him; for I ſwear unto you, I was never ſo put to it in all my life: But ſince the Shepherd revived, &amp; his complexion came into his face<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he appeared to be a very handſom man, and of a wit above the capacity of a Shepheard. I never ſaw any in our Court more civiliz'd, nor more deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving love: So as no wonder <hi>Galathea</hi> ſhould be ſo deſperately in love with him, as ſhee cannot be abſent from him either night or day. But certainly ſhe is much miſtaken in him; for he is moſt deſperately in love with a Shepheardeſs called <hi>Aſtrea:</hi> So as all theſe things make not a little againſt <hi>Lindamor:</hi> For the Nimph finding all true that this Impoſtor told her, ſhe is reſolved rather to dye than to marry <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and ſtudies all waies to win upon the affection of this Shepheard, who does nothing even in her very preſence but ſigh for his abſence from <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> I know not whether his impriſonment be the cauſe (for ſhee will not let him goe out of the Palace) or whether it be the abundance of water which hee ſwallowed when he was in the River; but ſo it is, he is fallen into a moſt violent Feaver: So as not knowing what to doe for his health, <hi>Galathea</hi> commanded mee to come in all haſte unto you, to the end you might ſee him, and tell us what was beſt for him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Druide</hi> ſtood very attentive unto this diſcourſe, and had ſeveral conceits according to the ſubject of his Neeces words; and perhaps, ſome not far off the truth; for he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that ſhe was not altogether exempted either from love or blame. Yet he did very diſcreetly diſſemble it, and told her he was very glad to ſerve either <hi>Galathea</hi> or <hi>Celadon,</hi> whoſe Parents he ever loved; and who though he was a Shepheard, yet he was deſcended from the beſt of our Knights, whoſe Anceſtors made choice of that kind of life as more tranquill and happy, than that of the Court, and therefore he honoured him, and would be glad to ſerve him. But yet this kind of living with him was neither ſafe nor honourable for either <hi>Galathea</hi> or her. And when hee came to the Palace and ſaw their deportments, then he would tel her how ſhe ſhould demean her ſelf. <hi>Leonida</hi> being a little aſhamed, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, that ſhe did intend long ſince to tell him of it, but truly ſhe had neither the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence nor the conveniency to do it: Yet of a truth, <hi>Climanthes</hi> was the cauſe of all this. Oh, anſwered <hi>Adamas,</hi> could I but catch him, I ſhould with uſury pay him for falſly uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53526:78"/>
the title of a <hi>Druide.</hi> That Sir, ſaid the Nymph, will be an eaſie matter by the means that I ſhall finde out: For he told <hi>Galathea,</hi> that ſhe ſhould come four or five times to the place where ſhe was to meet with this man that would make her happy, in caſe ſhe did not meet with him the firſt day: And I know that <hi>Polemas</hi> and he coming too late the firſt day, will not fail to be there the dayes following: And whoſoever will catch this Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, muſt hide themſelves in a place where I ſhall direct, and they will be ſure to find him. As for the daies of his comming, I can bee informed from <hi>Galathea,</hi> though for my part I have forgotten them.</p>
               <p>With ſuch diſcourſe as this, the <hi>Druide</hi> and the Nymph beguiled the length of the way, and they were both ſo attentive, as they were at the Palace of <hi>Iſaures</hi> before they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware. But the <hi>Druide</hi> extreamly diſliking this kind of life they led, did inſtruct <hi>Leonida</hi> what ſhe ſhould ſay unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> but whatſoever ſhee did, not to let her know that hee diſapproved any of her actions: for, ſaid hee, ſuch courages and ſpirits as the Nymphs muſt be wonne upon by ſweetneſs and lenity, not by rigour and force. And you Neece, I pray conſider and remember your duty, and know that theſe follies of love are diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable both for thoſe that own them, and thoſe that favour them. He had continued on his Inſtructions had they not met <hi>Silvia</hi> at their Palace gates, who conducted them unto <hi>Galathea:</hi> At that time ſhe was walking in the Garden whilſt <hi>Celadon</hi> repoſed himſelf: As ſoon as ever ſhe ſaw them, ſhe went unto them; the <hi>Druide</hi> kneeled down, and kiſſed her hand; <hi>Leonida</hi> did the ſame. Afterwards the Nymph embraced them both and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Adamas</hi> for his paines in comming to her, promiſing requital upon the firſt occaſion. Madam, ſaid he unto her, all my ſervices are but juſt duties, and the very beſt of them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not merit half this expreſſion: I am ſorry onely that I want occaſions to make the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure of my affection known unto you, and if I have not at any time been deficient, it was onely want of opportunities, not of any will to ſerve you. <hi>Adamas,</hi> anſwered the Nimph, the ſervice which you have done unto <hi>Amaſis,</hi> I take as done unto my ſelf: And what I have received from your Neece, I accept of as from you: And therefore, conſidering all circumſtances, I have had ſufficient tryal of your goodneſs. I do acknowledge your ſervices paſt to be great, but this which I am now to imploy you in, is the greateſt, and will be the moſt acceptable unto me, for no greater cure can be than of a wounded ſpirit. We wil talk more of it at leaſure; in the mean time goe and reſt your ſelf: <hi>Silvia</hi> will conduct you to your chamber, whilſt <hi>Leonida</hi> does give me an accompt of what ſhe hath done. Thus the <hi>Druide</hi> was diſmiſſed, and <hi>Galathea</hi> carraſſing <hi>Leonida</hi> more than uſual, asked her what ſhe had done in her journey? Unto which <hi>Leonida</hi> gave her a ſatisfactory anſwer: Madam, ſaid ſhe I thank the gods that I have found you more joyful than I left you. Friend, ſaid the Nimph, <hi>Celadons</hi> recovery is the cauſe: for you muſt know, that you were not gone a mile from hence before the Feaver left him, and ever ſince he hath ſo mended, as he himſelf hopes within two or three daies hee ſhall be able to riſe. This, anſwered <hi>Leonida,</hi> is the beſt news I could deſire, and had I known as much, I ſhould not have brought <hi>Adamas</hi> hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But to the purpoſe, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> What does he ſay to this accident? For I aſſure my ſelf you have acquainted him with it. Pardon me, Madam, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> I told him no more than what I thought could not be concealed from him when he came: He knows of the affection you beare unto <hi>Celadon,</hi> which I told him was onely an effect of your pitty. Hee knows the Shepheard very well, and all his family, and is confident he can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him unto what he pleaſeth: For my part, I think, that if you doe imploy him, hee will doe you good ſervice, but then you muſt be ingenuous and ſpeak freely and openly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Oh my God, ſaid the Nymph, do you think this poſſible? Certainly when hee underſtands the whole ſtory he will never apprehend it unto my contentment; for his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and judgement is ſo great, as I doubt he will rather condemn, than further the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Madam, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> I do not ſpeak without ſome ground; you ſhall ſee if you do imploy him, what ſervice he will doe you. Thus the Nimph was the moſt contented perſon in the world, fancying her ſelf already at the very top of all her deſires. But whilſt they were thus diſcourſing, <hi>Silvia</hi> and <hi>Adamas</hi> were talking of the ſame buſineſs: For this Nymph being at the firſt very familiar with him, did at the firſt ſpeak openly unto him. <hi>Adamas</hi> much deſiring to know whether all his Neece had related was true, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her to relate unto him all ſhe knew, which <hi>Silvia</hi> did without any diſſimulation, and as briefly as ſhe could, in this manner.</p>

               <p>KNow, that for the better underſtanding of what you deſire, I am forced to touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the particulars of <hi>Leonida</hi>'s life, whoſe Deſtiny ſeems to twiſt together all her deſignes with thoſe of <hi>Galathea.</hi> What I ſhall ſay concerning her, is not by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion or blame, nor with any intention to divulge her faults; for in telling them unto you, I think them to be as ſecret as if they had never been told. You muſt know then, that the beauty and merits of <hi>Leonida,</hi> had long ſince gotten the affection of <hi>Polemas;</hi> and the merits of that Cavalier being very high, your Neece gave his affection a kind reception, yet behaved her ſelf with ſo much diſcretion, that it was long before <hi>Polemas</hi> knew it. I know that your ſelf have loved in your time, and knows better than I doe, how hard a thing it is to hide love. And ſo it was, that the vaile being taken away, both of them did know that both of them were lovers and both loved. However, they durſt not of a long time declare it. After the Feſtivall which <hi>Amaſis</hi> did Solemnize every yeare, as her day of Marriage with <hi>Pimander:</hi> So it was, that after dinner we all walked in the Garden at <hi>Mont-briſon,</hi> and ſhe and I ſet our ſelves down under ſome Trees to ſhelter our ſelves from the heat of the Sun. No ſooner were we ſet, but <hi>Polemas</hi> came to us, ſeeming as if but accidentally; though I obſerved, that he followed us by the eye, a good way diſtant. And becauſe we ſat ſilent a long while together, alſo he having an excellent good voice, I told him he would much oblige us if he would ſing. I ſhall do ſo, ſaid he (pointing at <hi>Leonida)</hi> if this fair one wil be pleaſed to command me. Commands, ſaid ſhe, would ſhew indiſcretion; but if you have any Song that is new, I ſhall think my entreaties very well beſtowed. I ſhall, anſwered <hi>Polemas;</hi> and moreover, I will promiſe you, that this which you ſhall hear, is ſo new, as it was made during the time of the Sacrifice this morning, whilſt you were at your Prayers. How ſaid I unto him, is my companion the ſubject of the ſong? Yes certainly, anſwered he, I am a witneſs of it, and then he began thus.</p>

               <p>Wee were both very attentive unto his air, and perhaps I ſhould have heard more, had not <hi>Leonida</hi> feared leſt <hi>Polemas</hi> ſhould out with ſomething which ſhe deſired ſhould be kept ſecret; and therefore as ſoon as ever he had done ſinging, ſhe began to ſpeak. I dare lay a wager, ſaid ſhe, that I doe know her of whom this Song was made; then whiſpering him in the ear, as if ſhe would name her, ſhe bade him take heed what ſhe ſaid before me. He very cunningly anſwered aloud, No, no, you are miſtaken, I ſwear it is not ſhe whom you named. Then I perceived, that ſhe did conceal her ſelf from me; and therefore ſeeming as if I would goe and gather ſome flowers, I parted from them, but not ſo farre diſtant but ſtill I held an eye upon their actions. Now ſince <hi>Polemas</hi> and ſhe fell off, he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed all unto me, but when they were in league together, I could never make her tell mee any thing. But being then together, they fell to diſcourſe, and ſhe did firſt begin it. Come, come, <hi>Polemas,</hi> ſaid ſhe, why doe you jeſt thus with your Friends? Tell mee truly, upon whom was thoſe Verſes made? Fair Nymph, ſaid he, your own ſoul can tell you as well as I, for whom they were made. How ſhould I know, ſaid ſhe, do you think I can divine things? Yes certainly, anſwered <hi>Polemas,</hi> and I doe think you one of thoſe who does not obey that god who ſpeaks by your mouth, but rather will be obeyed by him. How do you explain this aenigma? (ſaid the Nymph) I do explain it thus, replyed he; The god of Love doth ſpeak by your mouth, otherwiſe your words could not be ſo full of Fire, as to kindle ſo many flames as they doe in the hearts of all thoſe that hear them: And yet you do not obey that god when hee commands, That all thoſe who love, ſhould be loved again; but you, all diſobedience, doe make all thoſe who love you, to think you infinitely fair, but not at all loving, no not ſo much as pittifull. I ſpeak, Madam, for my own particular, and can ſafely ſwear, without the leaſt danger of perjury, that never any beauty under the Sun
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53526:80"/>
was, and is more loved than you by me. When he uttered theſe laſt words, he bluſht, and with a ſmile ſhe anſwered thus; <hi>Polemas, Polemas,</hi> old Souldiers can ſhew their valour by wounds and never uſe to brag of it, but you that talk ſo much of yours, would be put to your ſhifts to ſhew them, if Love your Captain General ſhould ask you where they are. Cruel Nymph, ſaid <hi>Polemas,</hi> you are much miſtaken; for I would onely bid him look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fair eyes of my enemy, and fully ſatisfie him; for then he would receive ſuch wounds as I have in my heart, and never complain of me. However, it is my glory to have ſuch a worthy author for my wounds. Should Love enter into argument with me, I ſhould ſooner ſatisfie him than you; for he would be ſenſible of my pain, which you never can, becauſe a fire cannot burn it ſelf. You can never be ſo ſenſible of our tears, who are ſo full of rigour, that though we do adore you as fair, yet we can hardly commend you as humane. <hi>Leonida</hi> did love <hi>Polemas,</hi> but as yet ſhee would not let him know it: On the other ſide, ſhe feared, that if ſhe ſhould put him quite out of hope ſhe ſhould then quite loſe him; and therefore ſhe anſwered him thus; <hi>Polemas,</hi> if your affection be ſuch as you ſay, then time will give me better knowledge of it, than all your well ſpoken words can, which are too eloquent to proceed from affection; for I have heard ſay, that affection cannot be without paſſion, and paſſion will not permit a ſpirit the freedome of diſcourſe: But, when time has told me as much as you have done, you may think, I am not ſuch a ſtone, but I ſhall be ſenſible of your merits, and your amity may perhaps finde a favourable reception; untill then, never hope for any more from me, then what you may from all the reſt of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in generall. <hi>Polemas</hi> would have kiſſed her hand, by way of aſſurance, but ſhe forbad him, ſaying, Cavalier, be diſcreet, many eyes are upon us; if you uſe any ſuch things, you will loſe me. Upon this ſhe roſe up, and came to us, who were gathering flowers. Thus was the firſt overture of any affection between them, which gave occaſion unto <hi>Galathed,</hi> to intermeddle in the buſineſſe; for ſeeing this paſſage in the Garden, and having a deſigne upon <hi>Polemas,</hi> ſhe would know that night what had paſſed between <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onida</hi> and him. And being ever very familiar with your Niece, ſhe durſt not abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the truth of this addreſſe; but <hi>Galathea</hi> preſſed the matter further, and would needs know the very ſame words which paſſed between them; unto which your Niece did partly anſwer truth, and partly diſſemble; but ſhe ſaid enough to exaſperate <hi>Galathea</hi> ſo much, as from that very day ſhe reſolved to get his love, and went to work with ſo many arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as it was impoſſible he ſhould reſiſt. Firſt ſhe began with <hi>Leonida,</hi> and charged her, to let this love betwixt <hi>Polemas</hi> and ſhe, go no further; then told her, that it was her beſt policy to root it out for ſhe knew, that <hi>Polemas</hi> had another aime, and made uſe of her only to laugh at: Further, if <hi>Amaſis</hi> ſhould come to know of it, ſhe would be much offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>Leonida</hi> who then had no more ſubdety in her than a little Child, received the words of the Nymph us from her Miſtreſſe, and never penetrated into the depth of her deſigne, but was for ſome daies ſo ſtrange unto <hi>Polemas,</hi> as he could not chuſe but wonder what the matter was. This, at the beginning, made him more hot upon this addreſſe, as it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary for young ſpirits to be moſt violent upon that which is moſt difficult unto them. And indeed, he did ſo continue his courtſhip that <hi>Leonida</hi> had much ado to diſſemble the affection which ſhe bore unto him, inſomuch as <hi>Polemas</hi> perceived well enough that ſhe loved him. But ſee how love had ordained it: After three or foure months continuance, in his moſt violent proſecution: of his courtſhip, and when he had attained to as much aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, as almoſt he could deſire, his affection began to ſlack, and loſe its violence, and by degrees grew ſo faint and bold, as it was quite dead.</p>
               <p>The Nymph did not take any notice, that ſhe was ſingle in this affection; the truth is, <hi>Galathea</hi> was partly the cauſe; for having a deſign upon <hi>Polemas,</hi> ſhe did uſe ſuch artifice, and was ſo indulgent towards him as it may be ſaid, ſhe did inſenſibly ſteal him: for when <hi>Leonida</hi> was ſhurp with him, <hi>Galathea</hi> was ſweet; when the one did flie his company, the other carraſſed him; and all this ſo long together, and ſo openly, that <hi>Polemas</hi> began to caſt his eyes upon <hi>Galathea,</hi> and a little after, his heart followed; for, he ſeeing himſelfe favoured by the greater, and ſleighted by the inferiour, he began to embrace the ſmiling fortune. But Oh! wiſe <hi>Adamas,</hi> ſee how it pleaſeth Love to play with hearts. At this time, <hi>Agis,</hi> at the motion of <hi>Clidaman,</hi> became a Servant unto your Niece, not ſo much, as you know, by election, as by inſtigation. At the firſt, this new Cavalier did apply himſelfe in all becomming courtſhip unto his new Miſtreſſe, and ſhe was ſtill wholly devoted unto <hi>Polemas: Agis,</hi> who like a Miſer, that has ſtill his eye upon his treaſure, did take notice of it, and complained unto his Miſtreſſe, but her faint and hollow anſwers, in lieu of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53526:80"/>
his jealouſie, did by little and little ſtifle his love: for, conſidering what looſe hold he had of her ſoul, he reſolved to let it go, and be gone himſelfe. The beſt receipt (as I have heard ſay) for the cure of a Lover. For, as Love has its beginning from the eyes, ſo its decay muſt needs be, from not ſeeing them; which cannot be but in abſence, where obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion ſwallowes up all memory of the party loved: And ſo it did in <hi>Agis,</hi> he was no ſooner gone but all love vaniſh'd out of his ſoul, and entertained diſdain in lieu of it, ſo as <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nida,</hi> in ſtriving to get <hi>Polemas,</hi> loſt him, who perhaps would have been entirely hers. But the rallerie of Love reſted not here, <hi>Polemas</hi> muſt have his ſhare as well as the reſt; for juſt about this time, the affection of <hi>Lindamor</hi> began to break out; and, as <hi>Leonida</hi> had loſt <hi>Agis</hi> for <hi>Polemas,</hi> and <hi>polemas Leonida</hi> for <hi>Galathea;</hi> ſo <hi>Galathea</hi> caſt off <hi>Polemas</hi> for <hi>Lindamor.</hi> It is a task too hard to relate all their particular follies: but ſo it was, that <hi>Polemas</hi> ſeeing himſelfe paid in the ſame coin that he payed your Niece, would not for all that, be out of either hope or love; but on the contrary, did uſe all inventions to ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate himſelfe, but all to this very houre in vain; But yet, this ſatisfaction he found, that he, who was the cauſe of his miſery, did not enjoy that happineſſe he aimed at: For, whether it was by reaſon of his ſtratagems, or the will of the gods, I know not, but <hi>Lindamor</hi> is out of favour as well as he: And it ſeemes, Love could never finde any reſt in the breaſt of <hi>Galathea,</hi> the memory of one was no ſooner out, but another was preſently in; and now, at this very time, her thoughts are all upon a Shepheard, whoſe qualities as a Shepheard may indeed merit much, but never to be <hi>Galathea's</hi> Servant; and yet ſhe is ſo extreamly paſſionate and tender of him, that if his-ſickneſſe ſhould continue, I know not what would become of her; for I never ſaw one ſo carefull, nor ſo troubled, as ſhe hath been, ever ſince he was ill. But this is not all, moſt wiſe <hi>Adamas;</hi> Your Niece is alſo ſo taken with <hi>Celadon,</hi> as I know not whether <hi>Galathea</hi> or ſhe be more, and hereupon great jealouſie is grown betwixt them: and though I qualifie the matter as well as I can, yet ſo it is, that I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of it for the future: And therefore I thank the gods that you are come; for really with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you; I know not how to carry my ſelfe betwixt them. Excuſe me in ſpeaking thus free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto you, ſince it is upon a buſineſſe that concerns you; the affection I do bear unto you, conſtraines me to it.</p>
               <p>Thus did <hi>Silvia</hi> end her diſcourſe, with abundance of demonſtration of her hatred, againſt this kinde of life, for which <hi>Adamas</hi> did much eſteem her. And to begin the cure of this Shepheard, and theſe Nymphs (for the laſt of theſe was the greater difficulty) <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> asked her advice. For my part, ſaid ſhe, I would firſt take away the cauſe, which is this Shepheard, and the effects may of themſelves follow; but this muſt be done with much artifice, elſe <hi>Galathea</hi> will never let him go. 'Tis very true, anſwered the Druide; but in the mean time, untill that can be handſomly contrived, care muſt be taken, that he do not fall in love with them; for there is ſuch a ſympathy between Youth and Beauty, that if they ſhould conjoyne affections once, all ſeparations will be in vain. Oh <hi>Adamas!</hi> ſaid <hi>Silvia,</hi> did you but know <hi>Celadon</hi> as well as I do, this would be the leaſt of all your fears; for he is ſo rooted in the love of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that all the beauty in the world except hers cannot ſhake him, eſpecially now he is ſick, for his care may well be more of his cure than any thing elſe. Fair <hi>Silvia,</hi> anſwered the Druide, you ſpeak as one that is ignorant in Love, and never knew the force of it; this little god can do ſuch miracles, that when there is leaſt appearance of any effects, even then will he ſhew his power: Be not therefore ſo ſecure, for there is no kinde of vertue whatſoever, that is Armour-proof againſt Love. Chaſtity it ſelfe cannot do it, witneſſe <hi>Endymion.</hi> Away, away, ſaid <hi>Silvia.</hi> Oh! wiſe <hi>Adamas,</hi> why do you terrifie me with ſo great a dyſaſter? Becauſe, ſaid he, I would have you arme your ſelfe againſt the forces of this god, leſt being too ſecure in your opinion of that which you judge impoſſible, you ſhould be ſurpriſed before you be prepared. I have heard ſay, that <hi>Celadon</hi> is ſo handſome, ſo diſcreet, and ſo every way accompliſhed, as he is furniſhed with all perfections which cauſe Love, and therefore there is danger: Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Love are ſo hard to be diſcovered, that not one of a thouſand can ſee them. Nay, nay, ſaid <hi>Silvia,</hi> let me alone for that, and tell me only what I ſhould do in this buſineſſe, that we have already diſcovered. I do conceive, ſaid the Druide, this cure muſt be wrought very much by the eye; and when I have ſeen how the world goes, we ſhall order things to the beſt advantage we can, and in the mean time, let us keep our deſign ſecret. Hereupon <hi>Silvia</hi> left <hi>Adamas</hi> to his reſt, and went to <hi>Galathea,</hi> who with <hi>Leonide</hi> was by <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don's</hi> bed ſide; for they hearing he was awake, they could neither of them hold from him: He eſteemed <hi>Leonida</hi> very much, her carraſſes did oblige him to it; but <hi>Silvia's</hi> humour
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53526:81"/>
pleaſed him much better. A litter after, they fell into diſcourſe of <hi>Adamas,</hi> much extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his wiſdome, prudence, and goodneſſe: Upon which, <hi>Celadon</hi> asked, whether it was not he who was ſon unto great <hi>Pelion,</hi> of whom ſo many wonders are reported? The very ſame, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> and he is come hither purpoſely to be your Phyſician. Oh Madam, anſwered the Shepheard, he muſt have abundance of Art if he can cure my diſeaſe: but, I am of opinion, that when he knowes it, he will ſo deſpair of my recovery, as he will not undertake the cure. <hi>Galathea</hi> thought, that he had ſpoke of the diſeaſe in his body: But is it poſſible, ſaid ſhe, that you ſhould finde your ſelfe ſo ill? I am confident, that if you would but help your ſelfe, you would be able to quit your bed in two or three daies. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not, Madam, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> for ſome are ſo inwardly ſick, as they themſelves do not know of it, untill it be at the height. Their diſcourſe had laſted longer, had not the Druide come, to ſee how ſquares went; and he found him well enough diſpoſed in body, for the Malady was paſt the height, and in its Decline; but when he talked with him, he found the diſeaſe to be moſt in the minde, though he did not believe it was for any of theſe Nymphs: Yet like a prudent Phyſician, he would feel how the pulſe of his minde did beat: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to begin the cure, he would try how he ſtood affected firſt to <hi>Galathea;</hi> and in order to this, when all the Nymphs were retired he ſhut the dores, and began thus: I ſee, <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> ſaid he, that your aſtoniſhment is not little, to finde your ſelfe exalted ſo ſuddenly unto ſuch a height of fortune, as this you enjoy; for I am confident it was above your hopes, ſince being born a Shepheard, and brought up in a Village, you are now carraſſed, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and waited upon by Nymphs, and ſuch as are accuſtomed to command; and more then that, ſuch as command the whole Country: You have great reaſon to be thankfull unto the gods for it, and pray, that it may continue. <hi>Adamas</hi> ſpoke in this manner, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely as an invitation, to make him ſpeak the truth of his affection, thinking by this means, &amp; ſeeming to approve of it, he would diſcover himſelf. Unto which the Shepheard anſwered with a deep ſigh; Father, ſaid he, if this be ſuch a high fortune, then certainly my mouth is out of taſt; for I did never in all my life reliſh more bitter Wormwood than this, which you call good-fortune, and ſince I came into this condition wherein you find me. Why, (ſaid the Druide, the better to diſcover his ſubtlety) is it poſſible you ſhould be ſo inſenſible of your happineſſe, as not to ſee the Grandure unto which you are advanced? Alas, alas, ſaid <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon,</hi> all this does but ſhew me a Precipice and menace me with the greater fall. Are you afraid, ſaid <hi>Adamas</hi> that this good fortune will not laſt? I fear (ſaid the Shepheard) that it will laſt longer than I would have it. Why ſhould Sheep languiſh and die in a great wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where Fiſhes thrive and play? Becauſe, anſwered the Druide, it is againſt their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And do you think, Father, (ſaid the Shepheard) that it is not againſt the nature of a Shepheard, to live amongſt ſo many great Nymphs? I was born a Shepheard, and ſo habituated to a Village-life; as nothing but things of my own condition and quality can pleaſe me. But is it poſſible, ſaid the Druide, that Ambition, which is ſo naturall unto men, cannot invite you to quit your woods? Cannot beautie allure a young heart unto it, and divert you from your firſt intentions? The ambition which every one ought to have, anſwered the Shepheard, is, to do that well which is their duty to do, and in that, to be the prime amongſt thoſe of their own rank; and that beauty which becomes us to look upon, and ought to attract us, is that which we may love, and not that which we ought to reverence, nor look upon, but with eyes of reſpect only. Why do you imagine, ſaid the Druide, that there is any ſuch Grandure amongſt men, which merit and vertue may not arive at? Becauſe, anſwered the Shepheard, I know, that all things ought to keep themſelves within the limits and bounds that nature hath placed them: A Ruby, though never ſo excellent in its kinde, can never become a Diamond; and he that hopes to elevate himſelf too high, or, to ſay better, to change his nature, and to make himſelfe more then he is, will but ſpend both his paines and his time in vain. The Druide now amaſed at the wiſe conſiderations of this Shepheard, and very glad to ſee him ſo far from any thoughts of <hi>Galathea,</hi> began to deal with him in this manner: Son, ſaid he, I am extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glad to find ſo much wiſdome in you, and do aſſure you, that as long as you continue in this minde, the heavens will ſhoure all manner of felicities upon you. Many are ſo taken up with vanities, and tranſported with them, that they run out of their wits, and that upon much vainer hopes than theſe I propound unto you: And what becomes of them at laſt? juſt nothing, unleſſe after long and intolerable paines, a ſad repentance, for ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelves to be ſo long deluded. You have reaſon to thank the heavens, that have endued you with this knowledge, before you come to repentance; and you have great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53526:81"/>
alſo to pray, that they will preſerve you in the ſame minde, in the ſame tranquility, and ſweetneſſe of life, in which you have hitherto lived. But ſince you do not aſpire unto any Grandure nor Beauty, what is it then, <hi>Celadon,</hi> that will ſtay you here amongſt theſe Nymphs? Alas, anſwered the Shepheard, there is nothing can ſtay me by my good will; it's only <hi>Galathea</hi> that keeps me here in the nature of a Priſoner, and the truth is, I would have tryed all waies to make an eſcape, had not my ſickneſſe prevented me; and if no way would have hit, I ſhould have been ſo unmannerly, as to have gone away by force When I would ſpeak unto <hi>Galathea</hi> about it, ſhe ſeemes ſo extreamly angry, as I muſt confeſſe; I durſt not mention it any more unto her: But, in the mean time, my ſtay here has been ſo tedious unto me, that I do accuſe it to be the principall cauſe of my malady. And therefore, Father, if ever you will compaſſionate the miſerable condition of an extreamly afflicted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I do conjure you by the great gods, whom you do moſt reverence and adore, by your own good genius, by the memory of your worthy Father, great <hi>Pelion,</hi> that you will take ſome pitty upon my life, and by your prudence, added unto my earneſt deſire, to help me out of this weariſome Priſon, for ſo I ſhall call it as long as I ſtay here. <hi>Adamas</hi> extreamly glad to hear how paſſionately he expreſſed himſelfe, did embrace him, and after he had kiſſed his cheek, ſaid thus unto him: Yes, dear Son, be confident I will do as you deſire; and aſſoon as your diſeaſe will permit, I will uſe all poſſible means to facilitate your get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of this place; continue only in this minde, and recover as ſoon as you can. Then after much other ſuch diſcourſe as this, he left him, ſo much contented, that if <hi>Adamas</hi> would have ſuffered him, he would have quitted his bed that very houre.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Leonida,</hi> who would not ſuffer <hi>Galathea</hi> to run on any longer in that errour, which <hi>Climanthes</hi> had infuſed into her, one night, when <hi>Silvia</hi> and the little <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill</hi> were retired, ſhe ſat down by her beds-ſide, and after ſome common diſcourſe, ſhe ſaid thus unto her; Madam, I have met with ſome newes in my journey, newes that concernes you, and I would not upon any termes conceal it from you, becauſe I ſhall thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly undeceive you. What is it, ſaid the Nymph? It is, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> the moſt ſubtle piece of knavery that ever Love invented, and I believe, you will not be ſorry for my voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, though it were for nothing elſe, but the diſcovery of it. This Druide that reſided here, is the moſt wicked fellow, and the cunningeſt knave, that ever deluded any one. Then did ſhe relate all that ſhe heard, from the mouth of <hi>Climanthes</hi> and <hi>Polemas,</hi> and all the plot that was invented, only to diſpoſſeſſe <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and ingratiate <hi>Polemas</hi> in his room. At the firſt, the Nymph was aſtoniſhed; afterwards, the love of this Shepheard did ſo flatter her, that ſhe was perſwaded, <hi>Leonida</hi> ſpoke this out of deſigne, to divert her affection from this Shepheard, and to enjoy him her ſelfe; ſo as ſhe did not give any credit to what ſhe ſaid; but on the contrary, turning it into laughter, ſaid thus unto her: Go, go, <hi>Leonida,</hi> go to bed, and to morrow perhaps you will be more ſubtle, and know how to diſguiſe your tricks better: Then ſhe ſmiled, and turned to the other ſide. This did ſo extreamly offend <hi>Leonida,</hi> as ſhe reſolved, whatſoever came of it, to ſet <hi>Celadon</hi> at liberty: In order to this deſigne, ſhe went the ſame night unto her Uncle, unto whom ſhe uſed this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; Father, ſaid ſhe, you ſee <hi>Celadon</hi> is now recovered, why ſhould he ſtay any longer here? I pray conſider what prejudice it may bring upon us all hereafter. I would gladly have undeceived <hi>Galathea,</hi> and divert her from the perſwaſions of the impoſtor <hi>Climantes;</hi> but ſhe does ſo dote upon <hi>Celadon,</hi> as whoſoever ſhall motion his departure, is her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared enemy: but I do conceive, the ſureſt way is to get him gone, which we can never do without you; for her eye is ſo continually upon me, as I cannot ſtir a foot, but ſhe takes notice of it, and ſuſpects me. <hi>Adamas</hi> did a little wonder to hear his Niece ſay ſo, and had an opinion, that ſhe was afraid that he perceived the good-will ſhe had unto this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, and therefore ſhe would blinde him: However, conceiving to cut up Love by the roots, the beſt way would be, to get <hi>Celadon</hi> away; he told his Niece, that he did very much deſire the ſame, but knew not how. The way, ſaid ſhe, is the eaſieſt in the world: Get the habit of a Nymph, put it upon him, he is young, and has not a beard; this way he may get out, unknowne who helped him, nor can <hi>Galathea</hi> tell whom to blame. <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> found this invention to be good, and the ſooner to put it in execution, would preſently go and get this habit made, under colour of going to fetch ſome Phyſick for <hi>Celadon,</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Galathea</hi> to underſtand, that though he was out of a Feavour, yet he was not out of danger to relaps, which he could eaſily prevent; and did communicate the deſigne unto <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> who did very well approve of it, ſo he would not ſtay too long before his return. <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> was no ſooner awake, but <hi>Galathea</hi> and <hi>Leonida</hi> went into his Chamber, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53526:82"/>
of ſeeing how he did. <hi>Adamas</hi> perceiving how aſſiduouſly indulgent theſe Nymphs were, did think delay to be very dangerous; and after ſome ordinary queſtions concerning his diſeaſe, he turned towards <hi>Galathea,</hi> and deſired her to give him leave to enquire of ſome particulars, which he durſt not do before her. <hi>Galathea</hi> ſuppoſing it to be ſomething that related to his ſickneſſe, withdrew, and gave <hi>Adamas</hi> an opportunity to acquaint the Shepheard with his deſigne, and promiſed him to return within two or three daies at the furtheſt. <hi>Celadon</hi> conjured him unto it, by all poſſible intreaties, knowing, that without him his impriſonment would laſt long. After he had aſſured him that he would, he took <hi>Galathea</hi> aſide and told her, that though the Shepheard was at that preſent very well, yet there was great fears of a relaps, and therefore it was requiſite to prevent it in order to which, he would go and provide ſuch Medicines as were proper for it, and return again. The Nymph was very glad of this; for, on the one ſide, ſhe deſired the Shepheards cure; and on the other, the preſence of <hi>Adamas</hi> began to be very troubleſome unto her, foreſeeing, that ſhe could not be ſo free with her friend <hi>Celadon</hi> in his preſence. <hi>Adamas</hi> knew her minde well enough; however, aſſoon as dinner was done, he went his way, leaving the Nymphs in perplexity enough; for all three had different deſignes, and each of them aiming at their ſeverall ends, of neceſſitie they muſt deceive one another: And this was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that they were commonly all three about his bed together, but eſpecially <hi>Silvia,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to keep them from talking with him in private; but for all her vigilancy, <hi>Leonida</hi> found a time to tell him the reſolution of her and her Uncle, and had this further talk with him: I hope, <hi>Celadon,</hi> (ſaid ſhe unto him) that when you are at liberty, you will not be ſo ungratefull, as to forget this good office, but will then conſider of it, and of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which now I do bear unto you; at leaſt, you will remember the injuries I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <hi>Galathea</hi> for your ſake: And if Love which in any other would produce a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall love again, have not the ſame effects in you; yet I ſhall be extreamly glad to hear from your mouth, that I am not diſagreeable unto you. <hi>Celadon,</hi> who already knew of this growing affection, had a deſire to ſtifle it in the cradle; but fearing, leſt if he ſhould diſpleaſe her, ſhe ſhould fall off from that courſe which ſhe had reſolved upon with her Uncle, he would give her ſuch an anſwer, as ſhould ſtill keep her in the ſame minde; and therefore ſaid thus unto her: Fair <hi>Leonida,</hi> what a ſtrange opinion would you have of me, if forgetting <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> whom I have ſo long ſerved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhould begin a new affection unto you? I ſpeak very freely to you, becauſe I know, you are not ignorant of my devotion to her. Oh <hi>Celadon,</hi> anſwered <hi>Leonida,</hi> you need not hide it from me, for I know as much of your affairs as you your ſelfe does. Then, Fair Nymph anſwered <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſince you do know it ſo well, how can you think I ſhould force my love from her, that has the ſole power of my ſoul, my life, my ſelfe, and all I have? I pray, look upon all the actions of my life, and then tell me how I ſhould give you ſatisfaction, and what I ſhould do. <hi>Leonida</hi> could not hide her fears at this diſcourſe; yet, being wiſe, and conſidering how againſt her duty it was to live in this manner, alſo that all would be in vain, ſhe reſolved to become a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe of her own will; but this being a work of greater difficulty, than to be done as ſoon as thought upon, ſhe thought it beſt to take a little time, and conſult with her pillow upon it: In this reſolution, ſhe ſpoke thus unto the Shepheard; <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſaid ſhe, I cannot now take that counſel with my ſelf which is neceſſary, I had need to have a little time to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter up all the powers of my ſoul before I can reſolve. Their diſcourſe had continued longer, had not <hi>Silvia</hi> interrupted, and ſaid unto <hi>Leonida,</hi> Doe you not know Siſter (ſaid ſhe) that <hi>Flurial</hi> is come? and hath ſo eſcaped the guards of the gates, and came to <hi>Galathea</hi> before any of us knew of it? Hee gave her ſome Letters: I know not from whence they came, nor from whom, but I am ſure they made her change colour two or three times. <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nida</hi> preſently imagined that it was from <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and therefore ſhe left <hi>Silvia</hi> with <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon,</hi> and went to <hi>Galathea</hi> to be ſatisfied. <hi>Silvia</hi> then ſeeing her ſelfe alone with him, ſhee began to talke ſo kindly unto him, that if any there could have made him in love, doubtleſs it had been ſhe. And ſee how Love is pleaſed to thwart our deſignes: The other two Nymphs who courted him with all poſſible artifice to make him in love, could not do it; and this who never aimed at it, did come nearer the mark than either of the reſt: By which is to be obſerved, That Love muſt bee free, and will not be obliged by any, but it ſelf and whom it pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>Whilſt <hi>Celadon</hi> was in theſe thoughts, <hi>Silvia,</hi> who thought upon nothing but occaſions of diſcourſe, becauſe ſhe was much pleaſed with his converſation, and delighted to hear him ſpeak, ſhe ſaid thus unto him; You cannot believe, Shepheard, how much I am pleaſed
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53526:82"/>
with your company; and I ſwear, that if <hi>Galathea</hi> be of my mind, we will have more of it than formerly we have; for I finde by you there is abundance of delight to bee taken in your villages, and in your honeſt freedom, ſince you are exempted from all ambition, and by conſquence from envy; and doe live without any artifice and ſlander, which are the four Peſts of our Court-life. Wiſe Nymph, anſwered the Shepheard, all this is moſt true, if we were out of the power of Love; but you muſt know, that the very ſame effects which Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition produceth in Courts, Love does produce in the Country; the envy of a Rival is no leſs than a Courtiers; and the Artifices of Lovers and Shepheards are nothing inferiour unto my others; and ſo detraction and cenſuring of others is as riſe amongſt us as you. The truth is, we have this advantage of you; for in lieu of two enemies which you have, which are Love and Ambition, we have but one of them. And from hence it is that there are ſome particular men amongſt us which may be called happy; and none, I believe amongſt you Courtiers: For, ſuch as doe eſcape being in Love, doe not eſcape the allurements of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; and ſuch as doe eſcape Ambition, have not ſuch frozen ſouls, as can reſiſt the flames of ſo many Fair eyes; whereas wee that have but one enemy, may the more eaſily reſiſt him, as <hi>Silvander</hi> hath hitherto done; a Shepheard truly full of excellent perfections, but more happy than wiſe; for he having yet never met with any beauty that pleaſed, or could attract him, he never holds familiarity with any Shepheardeſs, which is the reaſon that he preſerves his liberty; for my part I beleeve, that unleſs one do love ſome where elſe, it is impoſſible to be long with an amiable beauty, and not love her. <hi>Silvander</hi> anſwered, I am ſo little verſed in this ſcience, that I ſubmit unto what you ſay; yet I doe believe it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe than beauty which cauſeth Love, otherwiſe one Lady that is loved of one man ſhould be loved of all. There are (anſwered <hi>Celadon)</hi> ſeverall anſwers to this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. All beauties are not looked upon with one and the ſame eye: Colours, ſome pleaſe one eye, ſome another none all: So of Beauties, all eyes do not judge alike; but <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> reaſon me-thinks is above all. If any ask him why hee never was in Love, he will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that he has not yet found his Loadſtone; and when he has found it, then he ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly love as others do. What does he mean, ſaid <hi>Silvia,</hi> by his Loadſtone? I know not, replyed <hi>Celadon,</hi> whether I can well inform you; but hee is a man very well ſtudyed, and held amongſt us for a good Scholar: Hee ſayes, that when great <hi>Jupiter</hi> firſt formed man, and all ſouls he touched every one with a ſeveral peece of a Loadſtone, and afterwards put all the peeces in a place by themſelves: Likewiſe the ſouls of women, after he had touched them, he put them in a Magazine by themſelves: Afterwards when he ſent the ſouls into bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, he brought thoſe of the women to the place where the Loadſtones were, which touched the ſoules of the men, and likewiſe the ſouls of the men into the place where the loadſtones were which touched the women, and made every one to take one peece: If there were any theeviſh ſouls, they took ſeveral pieces and hid them. Now when that man meets with that woman that has that piece which touched his ſoul, it is impoſſible but hee muſt love her; the Loadſtone ſhee hath, doth attract his ſoul: And from hence proceeds the ſeverall effects of Love: For thoſe who are loved of many, are thoſe theeviſh ſouls who took many peeces of the Loadſtone: If any doe love one who loves not him again, that was one who took her Loadſtone, but ſhe not his. Many queſtions upon this were put unto him, unto which hee anſwered very well: Amongſt the reſt I put this, How comes it to paſſe (ſaid I) that one Shepheard loves many Shepheardeſſes? Thus, anſwered he, the peece of Loadſtone which touched him being amongſt the reſt, when <hi>Jupiter</hi> did mingle them all together, it broke; and being in ſeveral peeces, all thoſe who have them, doe attract his ſoul; but perhaps thoſe who are taken with ſo many ſeveral Loves, will never love much, becauſe thoſe little bits cannot have ſo much force as if it were a whole one. Moreover, ſaid he, from hence it comes to paſſe, that we do often ſee ſome perſons love others, who in our eyes are nothing amiable. Alſo from hence proceeds thoſe ſtrange loves which ſometimes fall out; As that a <hi>Gaule</hi> brought up amongſt many beauties, ſhould fall in love with a barbarous ſtranger. <hi>Diana</hi> asked him, what he could ſay for <hi>Timon</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> who never loved any, nor any loved him? His Loadſtone (anſwered he) is either ſtill in <hi>Jupiters</hi> Magazine, or elſe ſhe who took it, dyed in her cradle: So as when we doe ſee any one who does not love, wee uſe to ſay, his Loadſtone was forgotten. But, ſayd <hi>Silvia,</hi> what could hee ſay unto this, that none did love <hi>Timon?</hi> That ſometimes (anſwered <hi>Celadon) Jupiter</hi> did count the pieces that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, and finding the number come ſhort, becauſe ſome theeviſh ſouls had taken more than they ſhould, he ſent thoſe ſouls into their bodies without ſtones; and hence it comes to paſſe that many Shepheards and Shepheardeſſes, who are accompliſhed with many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53526:83"/>
qualities, yet are disfavoured, and none loves them. But <hi>Corilas</hi> put this queſtion to him; One loves another a long time, How comes hee to quit her, and love another? <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander</hi> anſwered unto this, That his Loadſtone, who changed, had been broken; and hers, whom hee loved laſt, was a greater peece than the other; as wee ſee a peece of Steel between two Loadſtones, will goe to that which hath the greater force, and ſo the ſoul will goe to that party who hath the moſt attractive power. Truly ſaid <hi>Silvia,</hi> this muſt needs bee an admirable Shepheard, that is full of ſuch fine conceptions; But, I beſeech you, tell me, Who is he? I ſhall hardly tell you that, Madam, (ſaid <hi>Celadon)</hi> for he cannot tell himſelf; yet by the judgement we can make of him by his good qualities, he is from ſomegood place; for you muſt know that he came into our village not long ſince with a very ſhort pittance of eſtate, and without any acquaintance onely this hee ſaid, that hee came from about the Lake <hi>Lemane,</hi> where he had been brought up of a child, Since he has got acquaintance, every one is ready to help him: Beſides, being an excellent Herbaliſt, and having great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the nature of Animals, his Flock ſo increaſes under his hands, and he thrives ſo well, as at this hour he may be called Rich, at leaſt in content. And, fair Nymph, it is no great difficulty to attain unto ſo much wealth; for Nature is contented with a little, and we who live according to her Rules are Rich, if contented; and our contentment being eaſily obtained, our Riches are quickly gotten. You are, ſaid <hi>Silvia,</hi> much richer in happineſs than we are. But you ſpoke of <hi>Diana;</hi> I know her onely by ſight; Pray tell me, who was her Mother? The Mother was <hi>Belinda,</hi> anſwered he, Wife unto the ſage <hi>Celion,</hi> who dyed young. And <hi>Diana,</hi> ſaid <hi>Silvia,</hi> who is ſhe, and what humour is ſhe of? She is, ſaid <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon,</hi> one of the faireſt Shepheardeſſes about the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> and let mee but except <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrea,</hi> and I will ſay, ſhe is the faireſt: for, beſides thoſe that are obvious unto the eye, ſhe has ſo many beauties of mind, as no more can be ſaid or deſired than is in her. Oftentimes we have been three or four of us Shepheards together, looking and admiring her, and alwayes concluded, that there was no perfection which could be wiſhed, but was to be found in her. And though her genius be not very inclinable to love, yet ſhe is ſuch a ſincere lover of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as ſhee does oblige more that way, than others doe by their moſt violent affections How comes it to paſſe ſaid <hi>Silvia,</hi> Has ſhe not many ſervants? No, anſwered <hi>Celadon;</hi> ſhe will not entertain any: The deceit which the Father of <hi>Philidas</hi> did put upon her, does hinder her. And truly it was the moſt notorious trick that ever I heard of. Were it not too much trouble to you, ſaid <hi>Silvia,</hi> I ſhould bee very glad to underſtand it from you, and alſo to know who <hi>Celion</hi> and <hi>Belinda</hi> were. I feare, anſwered <hi>Celadon,</hi> that the ſtory will bee ſo long as to weary you. No, no ſaid the Nymph, we cannot better employ the time, whilſt <hi>Galathea</hi> is reading her Letters. Then, in obedience to your command, anſwered hee, I ſhall do it as briefly as poſſibly I can: And thus he began.</p>

               <p>IT is moſt certain, fair Nymph, that Virtue, be it never ſo naked, is yet moſt lovely in it ſelf; and has ſo many attracting Adamants in it, that as ſoon as any ſoul is touched with it, it muſt needs love and follow it. But when this virtue meets with a fair body, it is not onely lovely, but admirable; all eyes and ſpirits are raviſhed at the luſtre of ſuch a glorious viſion. And this will bee apparently ſeen by the diſcourſe I intend to make you of <hi>Belinda.</hi> Be pleaſed to know, that not far off hence, about the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> there was a very excellently well quallified Shepheard, called <hi>Philemon,</hi> who after a long Mariage had a Daughter whom he named <hi>Belinda,</hi> and who being grown up to ripe years, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in beauty both of body and mind, admirable. Not far off her houſe inhabited ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Shepheard, called <hi>Leon:</hi> As neighbourhood had contracted a firm league of Amity betwixe theſe two houſes, ſo Fortuns would have ſome equality alſo between them, and beſtowed one Daughter upon <hi>Leon,</hi> whoſe youth promiſed much beauty for the future, her name was <hi>Amaranthe:</hi> The amity of the Fathers begat a frequency of Society between the Daughters. They were from their cradles brought up together; and ſince, did alwayes keep their Flocks together alſo: As they grew in ſtature, ſo in beauty: Many young Shepheards courted their amities, but all their ſervices and fair profeſſions of affection could obtain no more from them, but a civil and courteous reception. It hapned that <hi>Celion</hi> a young Shepheard about theſe parts, having a Sheep that ſtrayed, he came to look for it in <hi>Belinda's</hi> Flock, where ſhe her ſelf was: She reſtored the Sheep with ſo much kindneſſe, as the finding of this ſtrayed Sheep, proved the loſing of himſelf; and from that time hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan

to be ſenſible, that fair eyes have power to offend; for before he was ſo ignorant, that no ſuch thought could ever enterunto his ſoul: but, be his ignorance what it would, he ſo carried the matter, as knowing his diſeaſe, he made it known unto that Phyſician, from whom only he could expect a cure. <hi>Belinde,</hi> by his actions knew his diſeaſe almoſt as ſoon as himſelfe, for at the firſt, he could not tell her his minde; but his affection growing with his age, it came to ſuch a Grandure, as he did reſent it in good earneſt, and was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to change his childiſh Paſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>d you well very long, ſaid the Shepheard, and believe it, this good-will is confined unto no other time then the end of my life. Then the Shepheardeſſe, bowing towards him, told him that ſhe never made any queſtion of his affection, but ever received it with as much benevolence, as ſhe offered her own unto him. To which <hi>Celion</hi> preſently anſwered: I do kiſſe this fair hand by way of thanks, for ſo great a favour, and by way of promiſe of that faithfull ſervice which <hi>Celion</hi> vowes unto you, as long as he lives. <hi>Belinde</hi> perceived by the zealous utterance of his words, and the kiſſe which he paſſionately imprinted upon her hand, that he meant of another kinde of affection then ſhe intended and therefore would not let him go on in his errour: <hi>Celion</hi> (ſaid ſhe unto him) you are very far off that which you do fancy to your ſelfe you can finde out no readier way to baniſh me your company than this; if you do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire I ſhould continue the ſame affection to you, which I promiſed, continue you alſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſame compaſſe, which your vertue did ever promiſe me; otherwiſe I will break off all manner of familiarity with you, and protest never to love you: I could (as the cuſtome of thoſe that are loved is) chide and brawl with you, but I will not, becauſe I would free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have you know that if you behave yourſelfe otherwiſe than becomes you, you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have any hopes in my affection. She added many other bitter expreſſions, which did ſo aſtoniſh <hi>Celion,</hi> that he knew not what to anſwer; only he caſt himſelfe upon his knees at her feet, and without any capitulation, but ſubmiſſion, asked pardon, and proteſted, that his affection ſhould proceed no further; but, as ſhe did cauſe it, ſo ſhe ſhould regulate it. If you do behave your ſelfe ſo, ſaid <hi>Belinde,</hi> you will oblige me to love you, otherwiſe, the contrary Fair Shepheardeſſe, replyed he, my affection is now born, and ſuch as it is it muſt live; for it cannot die but with me, ſo as I cannot remedy it, but with time but I will promiſe to give it ſuch a check, as you ſhall command; and let me never be bleſſed with any favour from you, if you finde any action of my life that can diſpleaſe you. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, ſhe permitted him to love her upon theſe termes. And thus theſe two Lovers lived long in ſuch contentment, as they had good cauſe to thank their Fates for it: Sometimes he would ſend Letters unto her, by his Brother <hi>Diamis</hi> who preſented them unto her, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a colour of preſenting her with ſome fruit. She would often return him ſuch ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry anſwers, as he had ſome reaſon to be contented with And this affection was carried with ſo much prudence as few perceived it; <hi>Amaranthe</hi> her ſelfe, though ſhe was continually with them had been ignorant of it, had ſhe not accidentally found a Letter, which her companion had loſt: And ſee I beſeech you the conſequences of it, with this Note, That it is very dangerous for any young ſoul to come neer the fire of Love. Till now, this Shepheardeſſe never had the leaſt reſentment of any love, no, nor ſo much as any minde of being loved; but, as ſoon as ſhe ſaw this Letter, whether out of envie to her companion, whom ſhe thought no ſuperiour in beauty; or becauſe ſhe was of that age which is moſt apt to take fire; or whether this Letter contained ſuch hot and ſervent expreſſions, as would thaugh a piece of Ice: ſo it was, that ſhe began to ſwell with deſire, not only to love, but to be loved again, by this Shepheard: And then ſhe read over the Letter again ſeverall times, which was thus penned.</p>

The truth is, they can hardly deny them, if they do but conſider, that no other Beauty but theirs, could ever make them ſo great. However, as if you intended to make your cruelty to equall your beauty, you ordain that affection, which you inſpired, may cruelly die in me. Oh heavens! was there ever ſuch a mercileſſe Mother, as to murder her own child. But I, that am more dear of any thing that comes from you, than of my life, will never ſuffer ſuch a piece of injuſtice; and therefore I am reſolved, to carry this affection along with me to my grave, hoping ſtill, that heaven, conſidering my patience, will once move you to be as pittifull unto me, as you are now dear and hard-hearted.</hi>

                  <hi>Amaranthe</hi> read over this Letter ſeverall times, and ere ſhe was aware, ſucked in the ſweet poyſon of Love, as a weary perſon by degrees falls aſleep; If her imagination brought the face of this Shepheard before her eyes, Oh how full of beauty and handſomneſſe ſhe fancyed him? His behaviour and mind was agreeable, his wit rare and every part ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, as ſhe thought her companion infinitely happy in his love. Then would ſhe read the Letter over again, and when ſhe came to the end of it, ſhe flattered her deſires (being blown by the bellowes of vain hopes) with an opinion, that <hi>Belinde</hi> did not yet love him, but that ſhe her ſelfe might perhaps eaſily get him; but this poor fond Lover never took notice, that this was the firſt Letter he writ unto her, and that ſince this, much alteration might be. <hi>Belinde's</hi> friendſhip ſometimes gave her a check; but love preſently ſurmounted friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.

This anſwer had been ſufficient to have diverted her, if Love of its own nature, were not like unto Gun-powder, which the more it is reſtrained, the greater force it hath: Her apprehenſions did oppoſe againſt theſe difficulties, ſome ſhadowes of reaſon, as that <hi>Celion</hi> could not ſo ſoon caſt <hi>Belinde</hi> off; that it would argue too great a levity in him, if he ſhould upon the very firſt Summons deliver up the Fort.

                  </gap>qued upon a Sea ſo full of dangers as was impoſſible to avoid a Ship-wrack, and finding her ſelfe not able to brook ſo great a diſpleaſure, ſhe grew ſo ſad, as ſhe ſhunned all company and places, where any pleaſure was to be found; and at laſt fell ſick in good earneſt: Her dear friend, <hi>Belinde,</hi> came preſently to viſit her, and not dreaming of any thing, deſired <hi>Celion</hi> to come with her; but the ſight of a happineſſe which one cannot have, augmenteth the deſire of it the more, and this viſit did but more feſter the diſeaſe of <hi>Amaranthe.</hi> Night being come, all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to their lodgings except <hi>Belinde,</hi> who was very much troubled at her companions miſery, though ſhe did not know what it was; for when ſhe asked her any queſtion, ſhe was anſwered only by ſighs at which <hi>Belinde</hi> was aſtoniſhed. And at laſt, a little offended at her, ſhe ſaid: I did not think, <hi>Amaranthe,</hi> that you had loved <hi>Belinde</hi> ſo little, as to conceal any thing from her; but I ſee I was deceived: And whereas hitherto I could ſay that I loved you, now I can only ſay, that I love a diſſembler. <hi>Amaranthe,</hi> whoſe mouth was cloſed with very ſhame, when ſhe ſaw <hi>Belinde</hi> alone with her, and being prompted unto it by the violence of her affection, ſhe reſolved to make tryall of the moſt deſperate reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that might cure her diſeaſe. Laying ſhame aſide therefore, as well as ſhe could ſhe opened her mouth two or three times, to declare the whole buſineſſe but the word died as ſoon as it was on her lips, all the could do, was to profer ſome interrupted words but at laſt, holding her hands before her eyes, as not daring to look her in the face whom ſhe ſpoke unto: My dear Companion, (ſaid ſhe unto her for ſo they called one another) our friendſhip will not permit me to conceal any thing from you, knowing very well, that whatſoever is ſpoken unto you, will be ever kept as ſecret, as if locked up in my own heart; but I beſeech you excuſe an extream error, which; to ſatisfie the Lawes of friendſhip, I am forced to open unto you. You ask me where my pain is, and from whence it proceeds? Know that it is Love, which ariſeth from the perfections of a certain Shepheard. But alas, being at this word overcome with ſhame and ſorrow, ſhe turned her head to the other ſide, and was ſilent, but turned her ſilence into a torrent of tears. <hi>Belinde</hi> wondred and knew not what to think; but, to cheer her up, I could not believe (ſaid ſhe unto her) that a paſſion ſo common unto every one, ſhould ſo much trouble you. To love is a thing moſt ordinary; but, to love the perfections of a Shepheard, argues an act of judgment. I pray tell me, who this happy Shepheard is. <hi>Amaranthe</hi> fetched a ſigh from the very root of her heart, and ſaid: Alas, alas, this Shepheard loves another. But who is he, ſaid <hi>Belinde?</hi> Since you will needs have it, ſaid <hi>Amaranthe,</hi> it is your <hi>Celion;</hi> I ſay, yours, my friend; for I know he loves you, and diſdaines me. Excuſe my follies, I beſeech you, and without notice taken leave me alone to endure my own torment.</p>
               <p>The wiſe <hi>Belinde</hi> hearing this, was ſo aſhamed of her companions error, that though ſhe loved <hi>Celion</hi> as well as poſſible, yet ſhe reſolved, upon this occaſion to render a ſtrange teſtimony of her friendſhip, and turning towards <hi>Amaranthe,</hi> ſaid thus unto her: Truly, <hi>Amaranthe,</hi> I am extreamly troubled, to ſee you thus tranſported with this affection. And though our Sex has not an abſolute authority over Love, yet thanks be to the gods ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you in this condition, I have, and wil give you a cleer teſtimony of my being your faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full friend. I do love <hi>Celion,</hi> I will not deny it; yet it is as a Siſter may love a Brother: But I do love you alſo as my Siſter, and will have him to love you more then me, (for I know he will obey me). Reſt therefore your ſelfe contented, rely upon me, and when you are well recovered, you ſhall ſee how much <hi>Belinde</hi> is yours.</p>
               <p>After much other ſuch diſcourſe, night called upon <hi>Belinde</hi> to retire, leaving <hi>Amaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the</hi> ſo full of contentment, as, forgetting all ſorrow, in a few daies ſhe recovered her former beauty. In the mean time, <hi>Belinde</hi> was not a little troubled, but ſeeking for an opportunity to acquaint <hi>Celion</hi> with her deſigne, at laſt, ſhe met with one as fit as ſhe could deſire: By fortune, ſhe found him playing with his Ram, in that great Plain where Shepheards do commonly feed their Flocks: this Animall was the leader of the flock, and was ſo well taught, that he ſeemed as if he underſtood his Maſter when he ſpoke unto him; in which
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53526:85"/>
the Shepheardeſſe took ſo much delight, that ſhe ſtayed longer there; at laſt, ſhe would try whether the Ram would obey her as well as him, and he ſeemed much more obedient: What do you think, Brother, ſaid ſhe unto him, of the acquaintance betwixt your Ram and me? I think, fair Shepheardeſſe, (ſaid he) that he is yours, if you will be pleaſed to do me the honour to accept of him; but it is no wonder he ſhould be ſo obedient unto you, for he knowes, that if he had not, I ſhould have diſowned him for mine, having heard me often ſay and ſing, that, All I had was more yours than mine. 'Tis very well, ſaid the Shepheardeſſe, I will try whether I have ſo much power over you, as you ſeem to give me; and will not only command, but earneſtly entreat a thing from you. There is nothing, anſwered the Shepheard, which you may not more abſolutely command. Then <hi>Belinde,</hi> ſeeing this fit opportunity, began to open her minde thus: Since that day we firſt began our friendſhip, <hi>Celion,</hi> I have ever thought my ſelfe obliged to love and honour you, more than any perſon living and I would not have you think I do intend to leſſen this love, for it ſhall accompany me to my grave; and yet perhaps you would make it diminiſh, did I not advertiſe you before hand, that my life and my friendſhip ſhall leſſen together. Theſe expreſſions made <hi>Celion</hi> admire, not knowing what ſhe intended: At laſt he told her, that he waited to know her pleaſure in much joy and much fear: Joy, becauſe he could think upon no greater honour then her commands; and Fear, becauſe he knew not what ſhe meant yet, death it ſelfe ſhould be welcome, if it came by her command. Then <hi>Belinde</hi> went on thus: You have ever, as well as now, given me ſuch full aſſurance of your obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that I cannot doubt of it; and therefore I ſhall not only intreat, but conjure <hi>Celion,</hi> by all the amity he bears unto <hi>Belinde,</hi> that he will obey her in this one thing: I will not impoſe any impoſſibilities upon him, nor to leſſen the love which he bears unto me, but on the contrary, would have him rather to augment it. But before I go any further, I pray you let me know, whether your affection was ever of any other quality then it is at this time. Then <hi>Celion,</hi> looking more cheerfully than before, anſwered, That heretofore he did love her with ſuch affection and paſſions, and with the ſame deſignes, that youth u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to produce in hearts, moſt tranſported with Love, and in this, he would not except one that did exceed him; but ſince, that her commands had ſuch power over him, as he hath moderated his paſſion; and his friendſhip has ſo ſurmounted his love, as he hath had no thoughts of her, but ſuch as would not offend a Siſter. I proteſt, Brother, replyed ſhe, for ſo I will hold you to be as long as I live; you could never have obliged me more than by this. Know then what it is I do deſire from you, only this, that preſerving ſtill inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly this affection which you do now bear unto me, you will place your love upon one of the faireſt Shepheardeſſes about <hi>Lignon</hi> Perhaps you will think this a ſtrange office from <hi>Belinde,</hi> but your wonder will vaniſh, when I tell you, that ſhe is one whom I do moſt love; for it is <hi>Amaranthe:</hi> Her, I do command you to love, by all the power that I have over you, for ſhe has earneſtly begg'd it of me. She was thus haſty in her command, becauſe ſhe feared, that if ſhe ſhould have retarded it any longer, ſhe ſhould not have had power to reſiſt his ſupplications, which ſhe foreſaw he would make. What do you think, fair Nymph (ſaid <hi>Celadon</hi> to <hi>Silvia)</hi> became of poor <hi>Celion?</hi> he looked as pale as death it ſelfe, and ſo much out of himſelfe, as he could not ſpeak one ſingle ſyllable: But at laſt, when he had a little recovered the uſe of his languiſhing tongue, and in a Tone, like one in the midſt of Torment, he cryed out: Oh cruell Nymph! have you preſerved my life hitherto, thus inhumanely to raviſh it away? This command is too ful of cruelty, to be heard &amp; live; and my love is too great, to let me die without deſpair. Alas, if I muſt die, let me die faithfull; and if there be no other way to cure <hi>Amaranthe,</hi> but by my death, I will moſt freely ſacrifice my ſelfe unto her health, ſo you will but change the doom of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and bid me die loving only you. <hi>Belinde</hi> was much ſtartled at this, but not altered:
<hi>Celion,</hi> ſaid ſhe unto him, leave off all theſe vain expreſſions, you will give me cauſe elſe not to believe what you told me, if you do not ſatisfie me in the firſt command that I do impoſe upon you. Cruell Shepheardeſſe (ſaid the ſad <hi>Celion)</hi> muſt you needs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me impoſſibilities? for though I dare not love you beyond your commanded limits; yet, command what you will, I cannot love any other.</p>
               <p>Pitty did begin a little to melt her heart, and it was abundance of content unto her, to ſee, that he whom ſhe loved moſt, did moſt certainly love her: And this perhaps had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered her reſolution, had ſhe not been reſolutely fixed to take away all thoughts from <hi>Amaranthe,</hi> that ſhe was ſtung with the ſame diſeaſe; therefore ſhe conſtrained all her pitty to retreat, which began already to draw tears into her eyes; and to the end they

Whether <hi>Celion</hi> had a ſad dejected ſoul ſeeing himſelfe ſo far from any conſolation or reſolution, let them, that ever loved, judge; He was two or three daies like a man loſt, he ran into the Woods, and ſhunned all manner of company: at laſt, an old Shepheard that was an intimate friend of his Fathers, and one that was very wiſe alſo loved <hi>Celion</hi> very well, ſeeing him in this condition, and perceiving, that nothing but ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Love could thus diſtract him, he was ſome comfort unto him by his counſell; For in his younger daies, he himſelfe had been in the like ſtraits; and began to mock <hi>Celion,</hi> for being ſo much troubled for ſo poor a buſineſſe, demonſtrating unto him, that the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was eaſie, and ſo very eaſie, as he was aſhamed, that <hi>Celion,</hi> who was reputed wife, and a man of courage, ſhould not hit upon it I know, ſaid he, that to fulfill this command of <hi>Belinda's</hi> is at the firſt a matter of ſome difficulty, and ſhe will think your affection to be extream, but that will oblige her the more to love you; yet, ſince you have made ſuch profeſſions of obeying her, it will content her, if you do diſſemble, and ſeem, as if you did obey what ſhe has commanded. This counſell ſounded well in the ears of <hi>Celion,</hi> and was accordingly executed. But before this, he had writ this Letter unto <hi>Belinde.</hi>

                     <p>HAd I merited ſo ruffe a Treatment as this which I have received from you, I ſhould ſooner have dyed than endured it; but ſince it is for your contentment, I ſhall enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it with a little more willingneſſe, then if in exchange you had hidden me die: Since I have wholly dedicated my ſelfe unto you, it is but reaſonable you ſhould have the whole diſpoſure of me: But I beſeech you conſider, that as long as this conſtraint laſts, ſo many daies are naviſhed from my life; for I cannot call thoſe daies life, that are full of ſorrow and death: Shorten them therefore, Oh moſt ſevere Shepheardeſſe, if there be but one ſpark of pitty remaining in you.</p>

               <p>It was impoſſible that <hi>Bolinda</hi> ſhould not reſent theſe expreſſions, which ſhe knew pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a moſt perfect affection; withall, it was impoſſible any thing could divert her from her deſigne She did advertiſe <hi>Amaranthe,</hi> that <hi>Celion</hi> would love her, and that ſhe would know it as ſoon as ſhe was recovered: Which advertiſment did ſo haſten her reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, as ſhe did make it appear, that to the cure of the body, the cure of the minde is not unprofitable. But Oh! what a lamentable conſtraint did <hi>Celion</hi> live in, and how intolerable was his torment? He grew ſo lean, and was ſo altered, as he was not knowable. But ſee the extream ſeverity of this Shepheardeſſe, ſhe was not contented with what ſhe had done; but becauſe ſhe thought <hi>Amaranthe</hi> had ſome jealouſie of their affection, ſhe was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to drive the Naile ſo to the head, that neither of them ſhould think, ſhe jeaſted The Shepheards addreſſe unto <hi>Amaranthe</hi> was obſerved by every one, for it was openly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; the Father alſo of this Shepheard being acquainted with the commendable vertues of <hi>Leon,</hi> and knowing his family to be honourable, he did not diſapprove of this Match. <hi>Belinde</hi> her ſelfe did propound the Marriage, and it was almoſt made up before <hi>Celion</hi> knew of it but when he heard of it, he could not forbear ſpeaking unto <hi>Belinde,</hi> and was ſo plain with her, that ſhe was halfe aſhamed: but the Shepheard ſeeing words would not do, he reſolved upon another courſe, and a better way, which was, to apply himſelfe unto his Father: Sir, ſaid he, I ſhould be very ſorry to diſobey you in anything, and more in this than any other thing. I ſee, Sir, that you do like of this alliance with <hi>Amaranthe,</hi> and as becomes me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have made addreſſes to her, and I do know no Shepheardeſſe more affectionate than ſhe: But, Sin, give me leave to tell you, that I do love her better for a Miſtreſſe than a Wife; yet I do humbly beſeech you, command me not to tell you my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Upon this, the Father had ſome ſuſpition, that he knew of ſome ill quality in the Shepheardeſſe, and did heartily commend the prudence of his Son, who he thought had ſuch a command over his own affections. Thus this Match was broken off, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer paſſages being publickly known, many did ask the queſtion, from whence this cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the buſineſſe ſhould proceed: The Father, he could not hold from ſpeaking of it unto his familiar friends, and they unto others, ſo as <hi>Amaranthe</hi> at the laſt came to hear of it, who at the firſt was much grieved; but afterwards ſeeing her own folly, in thinking to make her ſelfe loved by force, ſhe did by degrees fall off, reſolving to entertain the next
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53526:86"/>
motion of marriage that was offered. Thus were theſe Lovers eaſed of an intolerable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, but it was to be loadned with one much more heavie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Belinde</hi> was now at an age full fit for Marriage, and <hi>Philemon</hi> very deſirous to ſee her well beſtowed; he would have been very glad to entertain <hi>Celion;</hi> but <hi>Belinde,</hi> hating marriage as much as death, had charged him not to ſpeak unto her; yet promiſing him, that whenſoever ſhe ſaw her ſelfe forced to marry, ſhe would acquaint him, to the end, that then he might put in for a ſhare of her, and demand her in Marriage: And this was the reaſon, that <hi>Philemon</hi> perceiving the coldneſſe of <hi>Celion,</hi> he would not offer her unto him. In the mean time, <hi>Ergaſtes</hi> the prime Shepheard of all the Country, and one who was generally eſteemed for his many vertues, did make an overture of Marriage with her; and becauſe he would not have the buſineſſe talked of, untill he was ſure of ſpeeding, he, who did treat about the matter, did carry it ſo cloſely, that a promiſe was made of the Marriage as ſoon as asked; for <hi>Philemon</hi> making himſelfe ſure of his Daughters obedience, did firſt paſſe his word, and then acquainted her. At the firſt, ſhe could not reſolve what to do becauſe he was a man whom ſhe had never ſeen: However, this lofty ſpirit, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would ſink under the burthen of any miſery, did preſently rouſe up it ſelfe, and did not ſeem the leaſt diſcontented at it for her own ſake, which was more than ſhe could do for <hi>Celion;</hi> and now her error of obſtinate hatred againſt marriage, muſt be waſhed away with tears. So it was, that to be as good as her promiſe, ſhe acquainted poor <hi>Celion,</hi> that <hi>Philemon</hi> intended to marry her. As ſoon as <hi>Celion</hi> had this ſo much deſired permiſſion, he did ſo ſolicite his Father, that the very ſame day he made the motion unto <hi>Philemon;</hi> but it was too late, for which <hi>Belinde's</hi> Father was very ſorry for he loved <hi>Celion</hi> much better then <hi>Ergaſtes.</hi> Oh heavens! what griefe, when he heard the doom of his misfortune; he went immediately out of the houſe, and never reſted till he found <hi>Belinde.</hi> At his firſt accoſt, he could not ſpeak, but his looks did ſufficiently tell what was <hi>Philemon's</hi> anſwer. Though ſhe ſtood in as great need of ſome good counſell as he, and ſtrength to ſupport this blow: yet ſhe would ſhew her ſelfe ſo ſtout, as not to ſtoop to any dyſaſter: but ſhe would not ſhew her ſelfe ſo inſenſible, as not to ſhew how ſhe reſented the Shepheards miſery, but made it appear unto him, that it did diſpleaſe her: Whereupon ſhe asked him, how her Father reliſhed the motion? The Shepheard related the very ſame anſwer which <hi>Philemon</hi> gave, adding ſo many ſighs and ſad lamentations, that ſhe had been a very Rock, had ſhe not been moved at them; yet ſhe did interrupt him, ſurmounting her ſelfe with as much vertue as poſſible, and told him, that lamentations were only for poor weak ſpirits, and did not become perſons of courage; and therefore he did both himſelfe and her wrong, if he uſed any ſuch expreſſions. <hi>Celion,</hi> (ſaid ſhe) where is that brave reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which you ſaid, you had armed your ſelfe withall, againſt all accidents whatſoever, except at the change of my affections can any thing elſe make you ſtagger? Conſider, that words do no good at all, only make thoſe that hear them, think worſe both of you and me? For heavens ſake, do not ſtain my honour with that pusillanimity, which hitherto I have with ſo much pain avoided; and ſince there is no better remedy be patient as I am: perhaps the heavens will hereafter contrive things better to our contentment, then we at this time ought to deſire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For my part, I will avoid the misfortune as much as I can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; and if there be no better remedy, we will reſolutely fly from it, and leave one another. Theſe laſt words made him almoſt deſperate, imagining, that her great courage proceeded from the faintneſſe of her affection. Could I as eaſily reſolve upon this accident as you, (anſwered the Shepheard) I ſhould think my ſelfe unworthy of your Love; for a hollow faint affection deſerves not ſuch a happineſſe. For a reward of all my ſervices you bid me reſolve to loſe you and does implicitely bid me not deſpair, if I ſee you, Another's. Ah <hi>Belinde!</hi> with what face can you look upon your new friend? with what kinde of heart can you love? and how can you ever carraſſe him, ſince you have promiſed a thouſand times never to love any but me, ſince your heart has ſo often ſworn never to be any but mine? Well, you do command me to leave you, and to obey you, I will do ſo; for the laſt minute of my life, ſhall be the firſt of my diſobedience. I pray the heavens, you may be as happy in your new choice, as I ſhall be miſerable. Live and enjoy all contentment with <hi>Ergaſtes;</hi> and may you enjoy as much good fortune together, as I have will to do you ſervice; may this new affection ſwell with all delights, and laſt as long as life, whilſt I am ſure my moſt faithfull affection will be ſmoothered with extream griefs. <hi>Belinde</hi> did let <hi>Celion</hi> ſpeak ſo long together becauſe ſhe feared, that if ſhe ſpoke, her tears would do the office of words, and that would argue too little power over her ſelfe. Oh proud beauty, that had rather be
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53526:86"/>
cenſured for want of love than reſolution? But at laſt, finding her ſelfe confident enough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe ſaid thus unto him: <hi>Celion,</hi> you think that all this is an argument of your affection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I think the contrary; for how can you love me, and have ſuch an ill opinion of me? If you took this opinion up ſince this laſt accident, it is to be believed, that that affection is not very great which can ſo ſuddenly change: If you have not an ill opinion of me, how can you poſſibly think, that once I did love you, and now do not? Conſider how unlikely it is, that <hi>Celion,</hi> whom I loved above all the world, and whoſe humours were ever as agreeable to me, as my own, ſhould be changed for <hi>Ergaſtes?</hi> whom I never ſaw, and whom rather then I will marry, I will marry a Grave. If I be forced, it is by the commands of a Father, whom neither in duty nor honour I ought to diſobey. But is it poſſible you ſhould ſo ſoon forget all thoſe vowes and proteſtations which I have made unto you, never to marry? How comes this change to paſſe? For if you did love me without marrying me, why can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not you love me ſtill without marrying me? And when I have a Husband, who can forbid me to love a Brother ſtill, with as much affection, as is due unto a Brother? Adieu, adieu, my <hi>Celion,</hi> live, and love me, who will love you to the laſt, whatſoever becomes of <hi>Belin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de:</hi> At this word ſhe kiſſed him, which was a greater favour than ever yet ſhe did him, and left him ſo much out of himſelfe, that he could not utter one ſyllable. When he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to himſelfe, and conſidered that love ought to bend unto duty, and that there was not one ſpark of hope left, which could help him out of his griefes, like a man that ravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his reſolutions, he wandred up and down Woods and unfrequented places, where he did nothing but lament his cruell dyfaſter; do what all his friends could, they could not perſwade him from this errant life.</p>
               <p>Thus he lived many daies, in which he moved the very Rocks unto pitty. And to the end, ſhe who was the cauſe of his miſery, might a little reſent it, he ſent her theſe Verſes.</p>

               <p>Whilſt this Shepheard was thus talking to himſelf, and ſo troubled at this dyſaſter, as he talked loud enough to be heard a long way off, <hi>Belinde,</hi> who had not forgot the time and place of appointment, as ſoon as ever ſhe had rid her ſelf of her company, ſhee came unto him, ſo troubled at the thought of loſing him, as ſhe could not ſo hide her ſorrows, but ſome appeared in her face. <hi>Ergaſtes,</hi> who was that morning got up betimes to walk, by fortune ſpied her afarre off, and ſeeing ſhee was by her ſelf, as if ſhe ſought for ſome cloſe place, hee had a minde to ſee whither ſhee intended to goe; and following her at a diſtance, he ſaw ſhe went towards the Fountaine of Sicamours; then looking a little further, hee ſaw, though it was very early, a Flock feeding: <hi>Ergaſtes</hi> not being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of all paſſages betwixt his Shepheardeſſe and <hi>Celion,</hi> had a conceipt that it was his Flock, and that <hi>Belinde</hi> was going unto him. Although hee did not ſuſpect the Chaſtity of his Miſtris; yet he was eaſily induced to beleeve that ſhe did not hate him, imagining that ſo large a Courtſhip had never been, if it had been diſagreeable unto her. And ſo, to ſatisfie his curioſity, as ſoon as he ſaw her amongſt the Trees, ſo as ſhe could not perceive him he crept nearer, and hid himſelf in a buſh, from whence he could ſee the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe ſitting upon the graſſie ſeats about the Fountain, and <hi>Celion</hi> upon his knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her. Oh how he was ſtartled as ſoon as he ſaw this! Yet becauſe he would hear what they ſaid, he crept cloſe under the hedge which was about the Fountain, and ſo heard every ſyllable what the Shepheardeſſe ſaid. What, <hi>Celion,</hi> ſaid ſhee, is this your profeſſion to pleaſe mee? Hath this accident more force upon you, than the power which you have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me, hath? Where is your courage <hi>Celion,</hi> or indeed where is your affection? Have you not out of your love to me ſurmounted greater difficulties than this? Where is your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? What is become of thoſe reſolves which you once profeſſed? Would you have me beleeve that you have leſſe affection unto me now, than at that time? Oh Shephead, rather rob mee of my life, than of that good will which you long ſince have promiſed unto mee. How comes it to paſſe that hitherto I have had as much power over you as I could deſire? And why ſhould I have any leſſe for the future? <hi>Ergaſtes</hi> heard alſo what <hi>Celion</hi> anſwered. Is it poſſible, <hi>Belinde</hi> (ſaid hee) that you can make any queſtion of my affection, or the power you have over me? Can you be ſo forgetfull of all thoſe teſtimonies which I have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred you of it? And muſt I ſurvive that good opinion which you ought to have of mee? Can you, <hi>Belinde,</hi> tax mee in any of my actions, or ever doubt of my obedience unto all your commands? I pray, before you doe entertain any ſuch ill opinions of mee, aske <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranthe</hi> what ſhe thinks: Nay, ask <hi>Belinde</hi> her ſelf, if ever ſhe impoſed any difficulty upon mee, which my affection has not ſurmounted? Even at this very time, when I ſee you are giving your ſelfe unto another, I am ready to leave you in the arms of one more happy than my ſelfe, by putting an end to my dyſaſterous love, and baniſhing my ſelfe for ever
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53526:88"/>
from you. Alaſſe, can you ſay, that this is any want of affection or will to obey you, ſince I doe reſent it more diſmally than death it ſelf? Oh Shepheardeſſe, what ſtrange miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings are betwixt you and me? For if you doe doubt of my affection becauſe I ſupport this dyſaſter and live, I will tell you that your extreme reſoluteneſs is too certain an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your ſmall affection. But to what purpoſe ſhould I retain any hopes of you, ſince another (O fatal word) another muſt enjoy you. At this word, the poor Shepheard, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſtrength or thought leaned upon <hi>Belinde</hi>'s knee, and there ſwooned: Whether <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linde</hi> was toucht to the heart at this, I leave you to judge, fair Nymph, ſince ſhe did love him as well as was poſſible to love, and ſeemed onely as if ſhee did not reſent this ſad ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. When ſhe ſaw him in this ſwounding fit, and thought there was no witneſs but the Sicamours and Fountain, ſhe would not conceale from them what ſhee had kept ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret from her all companions: Alaſs (ſaid ſhe and held up her hands) Oh ye ſoveraigne powers, either deliver me from this miſery or from my life; either remove this cruel dyſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or let this cruel dyſaſter remove me. Then caſting her eyes upon <hi>Celion,</hi> and thou, O too faithfull Shepheard (ſaid ſhee) who hadſt not been ſo miſerable if thou hadſt not loved me, Oh that the heavens would either give thee that contentment which thy affection de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth, or elſe take mee out of the world, ſince I am the onely cauſe that thou endureſt theſe miſeries, which thou doeſt not deſerve. Then pauſing a while, ſhe went on; O how hard a thing it is to love well, and be wiſe both together? I know very well that my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has good reaſon to beſtow me upon the prudent Shepheard <hi>Ergaſtes,</hi> becauſe the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance is convenient for him; but alaſs, what's that to mee, as long as my love and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction lookes another way. I know <hi>Ergaſtes</hi> deſerves very well, and I could never hope for a more advantageous match than him; but how ſhould I give my ſelfe unto him, when as Love hath diſpoſed of me unto another? Reaſon is on my Fathers ſide, but Love is on mine: And not a love newly begun, but a love even from my cradle, by a long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance hath ſo inſinuated it ſelf into my ſoul, that he is more my ſoul than my ſoul it ſelf is. Oh heavens! Is it poſſible to loſe my ſoul and live? Tell me, <hi>Belinde,</hi> wilt thou not be utterly undone, when it is gone? As ſhe uttered theſe words, a river of tears ran from her eyes, and fell upon the hands and cheeks of the Shepheard, who coming to himſelfe by little and little, cauſed the Shepheardeſs to be ſilent, and wipe away her teares from her eyes leſt hee ſhould take any notice of them: And changing her countenance and voice, ſpake thus unto him; Shepheard, I muſt needs confeſſe I am very ſenſible of your pain, and did I doubt of your affection, I were the moſt ungreateful perſon in the world. But, alaſs, what will my acknowledgements and ſenſibilitie avayl, ſince heaven hath ſubjected mee unto the will of him who gave mee my being? Would you wiſh me to requite him with diſobedience? But admit I ſhould ſuffer my affection to tranſport me beyond my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Will that, <hi>Celion,</hi> ſet us in any more tranquillity? Can it be any contentment unto you if you doe love me, to ſee me grieve and mourn away all my dayes? Doe you thinke my diſobedience to my Father will not be a terrour to my conſcience as long as I live? Yes, yes, and more unto me than any other, who have ever diſallowed it in others; and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not for very ſhame fall into that ſinne my ſelf. Let us arme our ſelves therefore, O Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, with this reſolution, that as hitherto, our loves though extream, could never make us commit any crime againſt our duties, ſo for the future let us never ſuffer it to force us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: Beſides, where there is no remedy, complaints are but unprofitable: My Father hath beſtowed mee upon <hi>Ergaſtes,</hi> and this gift can never be revoked but by <hi>Ergaſtes</hi> himſelfe: And what ſmall hopes is there in that? But ſince I had diſpoſed of my affection before my Father, I doe promiſe you, and vow before all the gods, eſpecially before them of this place, that in affection I will be yours unto my grave: And neither Father, nor Husband, nor the Tyrant, Duty, ſhall ever be able to make me break my Vow. Heaven has given me unto a Father, this Father has given my body unto a Husband, and my Duty commands obedience unto my Father; but neither Heaven, nor Father, nor Husband can hinder mee from having a Brother, whom I will love, as I have promiſed you, whatſoever becomes of me. Upon theſe words, foreſeeing that <hi>Celion</hi> would break out into complaints and teares, ſhee did riſe up, and kiſſing his cheeks as ſhee bade him Adieu, ſaid thus unto him, I beſeech the gods, Shepheard, give you as much contentment in your voyage, as I ſhall want when you are gone. <hi>Celion</hi> had neither power to anſwer, nor courage to follow her, but lifting up his hands, and looking after her as long as he could ſee her, at laſt the trees interpoſed: Then lifting up his watry eyes unto heaven, after many a deep and ſad ſigh he turned the other way, not caring what became of either Flock, nor any thing he had
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53526:88"/>
left in his Cabin. <hi>Ergaſtes,</hi> who lay hid all this while under a thick buſh, heard all their diſcourſe, and was more ſatisfied with the vertue of the fair and wiſe <hi>Belinde,</hi> and more admired the ſtrength of her courage, and excellency of her reſolution, then is poſſible to expreſſe. After he had been a long time in a raviſhing contemplation of all theſe paſſages, and conſidering upon the extream affection that was between theſe two Lovers; he thought, that it would be an act unworthy of himſelfe, if he ſhould be the cauſe of their ſeparation, and that heaven had brought him ſo opprotunely to this ſad farewell, purpoſely to let him ſee that errour which unawares he was going to commit. Being then reſolved to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour their contentment, as much as poſſibly he could, he began to follow <hi>Celion;</hi> but he was already ſo far gon, that he could not overtake him; but thinking to finde him in his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, he took a little path which conducted to it: but <hi>Celion</hi> was gone another way, and without ſpeaking to any of his kindred or friends, he wandred up and down like a vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond many daies, without any deſigne, unleſſe to ſhun all men, and to gather ſuch wild fruits, as extream hunger made him gather in the woods. <hi>Ergaſtes</hi> ſeeing his deſigne fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated that way, after a day or two's ſearch after <hi>Celion,</hi> he came unto <hi>Belinde,</hi> hoping to underſtand from her which way he went, and as good fortune was, he found her in the ſame place where ſhe bad adieu unto <hi>Celion,</hi> being alone by her ſelfe at the Fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and thinking upon the laſt accident in that place, which had drawn into her eyes abundance of tears even from the very root of her heart. <hi>Ergaſtes,</hi> who ſaw her afar off, came neerer and neerer as cloſely as he could, purpoſely to ſurpriſe her; and ſeeing tears trickle from her eyes like two Fountains, this ſight moved ſo much pitty in him, as he ſwore, not to ſleep, untill he had given a remedy to her griefs; and to loſe no time, ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to her, he ſaluted her very kindly. She being-thus ſurpriſed, with tears flowing from her eyes, to diſſemble the matter, faigned, as if ſhe were waſhing her ſelfe at the Fountain, and putting her hand preſently into the water, ſhe waſhed her face; ſo as if <hi>Ergaſtes</hi> had not ſeen her tears before, he could hardly have known ſhe had cryed: That which made him moſt admire her vertue was, that preſently ſhe put on a countenance of laughter, and turning towards him in a very courteous manner, ſhe ſaid thus unto him: I had thought, kinde Shepheard to have been alone: but I ſee you are come hither upon the ſame occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as I did, I mean, to take the freſh air, and waſh your hands and eyes at this clear Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and truly it is the beſt and cleareſt Spring in all the Plain. Wiſe and fair Shephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe, anſwered <hi>Ergaſtes,</hi> and ſmiled, you have good reaſon to ſay, that the ſame occaſion brought us both hither, for it is very true; but in ſaying, that both of us come hither with intention to waſh our ſelves in this water, I muſt needs contradict you, for it was neither of our deſignes. As for me, ſaid the Shepheardeſſe, I hope you wil give me leave to tel you, that none knowes better than my ſelf with what intention I came. I do agree, ſaid <hi>Ergaſtes,</hi> that you do know it better than any other; but for all that, you cannot make me believe, that the ſame occaſion which you ſay brought you hither, was really and truly the occaſion. What then, ſaid ſhe, do you think it was? As ſhe asked this queſtion, ſhe put her hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her face, ſeeming as if ſhe rubbed her forehead; but indeed, it was to hide that colour, which ſhe perceived came into her face: Which <hi>Ergaſtes</hi> taking notice of, and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to put her out of that pain, in which he ſaw ſhe was, did anſwer her thus: Fair and diſcreet Shepheardeſſe, never think to diſſemble any longer with me, who knowes as well as you do the very ſecrets of your ſoul; and that you may the better believe me, I will tell you, that you were now thinking upon the laſt farewell which you gave unto <hi>Celion</hi> in this place. Who I? ſaid ſhe, in a great amazement. Yes, you anſwered <hi>Ergaſtes,</hi> but never be ſorry that I know it: for I do ſo much eſteem your vertue and merit, as I will do all I can to give you full contentment. I know of all the ſervices this Shepheard hath done you, and with how much honour he hath courted you; I know with how much affection he hath continued it this many years and more then that, how you have affected him. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all theſe things makes me deſire death, rather then be any cauſe of your ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Do not imagine, that any matter of jealouſie makes me ſpeak thus, for I never had the leaſt ſuſpition of your vertue; eſpecially ſince with theſe ears, I heard all the wiſe diſcourſe you had with him. Neither think but that I believe, I ſhall loſe my beſt fortune in loving you; but the only reaſon which reduceth me to give you unto him, whoſe you ought to be, Oh wiſe <hi>Belinde,</hi> is becauſe I will never ſuffer my contentment to be with your eternall griefe. And, becauſe I ſhould think my ſelfe culpable both to god and man if I ſhould be a cauſe, why ſo pure and vertuous a Love ſhould be broke betwixt you; I muſt alſo tell you, that in thus doing, I deprive my ſelfe of the beſt alliance I ever could have, and ſhall loſe
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53526:89"/>
my own content, for the ſatisfaction of yours. Me thinks I do in this, but what my duty commands me, and it will be no ſmall ſatisfaction unto me, to think, that if <hi>Belinde</hi> be contented, <hi>Ergaſtes</hi> is an inſtrument of it. Only this I ſhall require, and in it you will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me, that ſince I am a cauſe of your reunion, you will be pleaſed to take me in, as a Third amongſt you two; and that I may have the ſame ſhare in your affection, which you promiſed unto <hi>Celion,</hi> when you thought to have married <hi>Ergaſtes,</hi> ſo as both of you may receive me as a Brother. I am not able, fair Nymph, (ſaid <hi>Celadon)</hi> to expreſſe the joy of this diſconſolate Shepheardeſſe; nor do I think, that ſhe her ſelfe did know what language to uſe, for the expreſſion of her thanks; but taking him by the hand, and ſitting down by the Fountain ſide, ſhe told him all the whole ſtory that had paſſed betwixt <hi>Celion</hi> and her ſelfe, and after a million of thanks, ſhe entreated him to go himſelfe to <hi>Celion;</hi> for the tranſport of this ſad Shepheard was ſuch, that he would not return with any elſe that ſhould go and ſeek him, becauſe he would never believe this ſtory, if he heard it from any other. <hi>Ergaſtes,</hi> who would by all means finiſh the good work he had begun, reſolved to go the next morning with <hi>Diamis, Celion</hi>'s Brother, promiſing not to return, untill he had found him, and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Being thus gone, and taken the firſt way their feet light upon, they wandred up and down in queſt of <hi>Celion;</hi> and long had they looked in vain, if he himſelfe, tranſported with fury, had not returned into <hi>Forreſts,</hi> with a deſigne to kill <hi>Ergaſtes,</hi> and with the ſame ſword, reach the heart of <hi>Belinde,</hi> not being able to live, and let another enjoy her. In this rage he ſet forward; and becauſe he fed upon nothing but roots and herbs which he found in the high way, he was grown ſo weak, that he could hardly walk; and had not his rage ſupported him, he would have fallen down: needs therefore muſt he reſt himſelfe very oft, eſpecially in the heat of the day. Being thus weak and weary, he ſat down under ſome ſhady Trees, cloſe by a fountain; and after he had a while reſented his affliction, he fell aſleep. Fortune, that was now weary with afflicting him had a minde, it ſeemes, to make him compleatly happy, and directed <hi>Ergaſtes</hi> and <hi>Diamis</hi> juſt to the ſame place, and by chance <hi>Diamis</hi> walked firſt. As ſoon as he ſaw his Brother he knew him, and looking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him, told <hi>Ergaſtes,</hi> who being much rejoyced at it, would needs go and embrace him but <hi>Diamis</hi> would not ſuffer him, ſaying, I beſeech you, <hi>Ergaſtes,</hi> do not acquaint my Brother too ſuddenly with this newes, leſt it ſhould cauſe his death by exceſſive joy; therefore I conceive it better, to let me acquaint him with it by little and little: and becauſe perhaps he will not believe me, you may come after, and confirm him in what I ſaid. <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſtes</hi> thinking this advice to be good, he went behinde ſome Trees, where he could not be ſeen, and <hi>Diamis</hi> went forward It may be ſaid, he was inſpired with ſome good ſpirit; for had <hi>Celion</hi> ſeen <hi>Ergaſtes</hi> firſt, perhaps his deſperate rage might have proved fatall to him. As ſoon as <hi>Diamis</hi> came up, his Brother waked, and began to fall into his accuſtomed complaints; and, after he had ſaluted him, he ſaid thus: I thank the gods, Brother, that I have ſo happily found you, to deliver a meſſage which <hi>Belinde</hi> hath ſent unto you.
<hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linde,</hi> (ſaid he preſently) What! can ſhe have any memory of me, now ſhe is in the armes of <hi>Ergaſtes? Ergaſtes,</hi> ſaid <hi>Diamis,</hi> has none of <hi>Belinde</hi> in his armes; and I hope, if you have any reſolution, never ſhall. Do you doubt, Brother, ſaid <hi>Celion,</hi> that my reſolution will fail me upon ſuch an occaſion? I would ſay, Prudence, replied <hi>Diamis.</hi> I fear no pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will ſerve, anſwered <hi>Celion,</hi> to alter that courſe which Deſtiny hath reſolved upon. Deſtiny, ſaid <hi>Diamis,</hi> is not ſo much your enemy as you do imagine, nor are your affairs upon ſuch bad termes as you do think them: for, <hi>Ergaſtes</hi> has refuſed <hi>Belinde.</hi> How, ſaid <hi>Celion, Ergaſtes</hi> refuſed <hi>Belinde?</hi> It is moſt certain, (ſaid <hi>Diamis)</hi> and that you may the more believe it, <hi>Ergaſtes</hi> himſelfe will tell you as much. <hi>Celion</hi> hearing this newes, was ſo amazed, that he ſtood ſtill, and could not anſwer of a long time; but at laſt, recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting himſelfe, he ſaid thus unto him: Surely, Brother, you mock me. No, ſaid <hi>Diamis,</hi> I do ſwear by the great <hi>Theatates, Heſius,</hi> and <hi>Thamaris,</hi> and by all that is ſacred unto us, that I tell you truth, and that ere long you ſhall hear it from <hi>Ergaſtes</hi> himſelfe. Then <hi>Celion</hi> lifting up his hands and eyes unto heaven, Oh gods, ſaid he, unto what happy end have you reſerved me? Then his Brother, to interrupt him, ſaid thus: Never talk any more, Brother, of miſery and death, but of joy and contentment; and above all, prepare your ſelfe to thank <hi>Ergaſtes,</hi> for the favour he hath done you, for I ſee him coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us. At this word, <hi>Celion</hi> roſe up, and ſeeing him neer, he ran to embrace him, with as much good will, as a little before he intended ill: But, when he heard the truth of the whole buſineſſe, he fell upon his knees before <hi>Ergaſtes,</hi> and would have kiſſed his feet. I
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53526:89"/>
ſhall omit all their diſcourſe, Fair Nymph (ſaid <hi>Celadon),</hi> and onely tel you, that <hi>Ergaſtes</hi> when he was returned, gave <hi>Belinde</hi> unto him, and with the conſent of him and her father, he married her; only, deſiring both <hi>Celion</hi> and <hi>Belinde</hi> to accept of him as a third in their ſincere affection, he devoted himſelf intirely unto them, and would never marry.</p>
               <p>This, fair and wiſe Nymph, ſaid <hi>Celadon,</hi> is their Fortune, which was extreamly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py unto them all three, as long as the gods permitted them to live together; for a little while after a Sonne was born unto them, whom they named <hi>Ergaſtes,</hi> becauſe of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which they bore unto the kind <hi>Ergaſtes,</hi> and to preſerve him longer in their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: But it hapned that in the cruel Plunder and Ravage which ſome ſtrangers committed in the Provinces of the <hi>Sequanois, Viennois,</hi> and <hi>Seguntians,</hi> this little childe was loſt, and doubtleſs dyed for want. A few years after they had a Daughter which was called <hi>Diana.</hi> But neither <hi>Celion</hi> nor <hi>Ergaſtes,</hi> had much joy of this childe, becauſe they both dyed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after in one day. And this <hi>Diana,</hi> of whom I ſpeak, is ſhee who is held amongſt us for one of the faireſt and wiſeſt Shepheardeſſes in all <hi>Forreſts.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Celadon</hi> was thus relating unto the Nymph the Hiſtory of <hi>Celion</hi> and <hi>Belinde,</hi> whilſt <hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Galathea</hi> were diſcourſing upon the news which <hi>Flurial</hi> brought; for as ſoon as the Nymph ſaw <hi>Leonide,</hi> ſhe took her aſide, and told her, that ſhe would not have <hi>Flurial</hi> ſee <hi>Celadon;</hi> for, ſaid ſhe, he is ſo much a creature of <hi>Lindamors,</hi> as he will tell him all hee ſees: Keep him therefore in diſcourſe, till I have read my Letters, and when I have done, I wil acquaint you what news. Upon this, the Nymph went out of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and carried <hi>Flurial</hi> with her: Then, after ſome other talk, Well <hi>Flurial,</hi> ſaid ſhee, what news doſt thou bring unto thy Lady? Very good, anſwered he, and ſuch as both you and ſhe will be glad to hear; for <hi>Clideman</hi> is well, and <hi>Lindamor</hi> has done ſuch wonders in a Battle, that <hi>Merovia</hi> and <hi>Childericke</hi> doe eſteem him as his virtue deſerves: But here is a young man with me that would ſpeak with <hi>Silvia,</hi> and is denyed entrance by the Guards, hee can relate all particulars better than I; for hee came from thence, and I but from my Aunts, where one of <hi>Lindamors</hi> men brought theſe Letters, and ſtayes for an anſwer. Doſt thou not know, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> what his buſineſs is with <hi>Silvia?</hi> No, anſwered he, he would never make me of his counſel. He muſt enter, ſaid the Nymph; ſo going unto the doore, ſhe remembred that ſhe had ſeen him with <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> and ſuppoſing her companion deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the buſineſſe ſhould be ſecret, ſhee would not ask him any queſtions, ſeeming as if ſhee knew him not; onely told him ſhe would acquaint <hi>Silvia.</hi> Afterwards, drawing <hi>Flurial</hi> aſide.

                        <hi>NEither the length of my voyage, nor the horrours of VVar, no nor all the beauties of</hi> Gaule, <hi>are able to make the memory of your moſt faithfull ſervant, for get you, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, one minute. So as not being able to deny my affection the curioſity of knowing how my moſt adored Lady doth; after I had kiſsed your feet a thouſand times, I doe preſent unto you, all the good fortune which Armes have favoured me withall, and lay them at your feet, as a Divinity unto whom I owe them. If you will but be pleaſed to accept of them, I ſhal think myſelf more honoured thereby, than by all that Renown which Fame can trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet in my praiſe.</hi>

               <p>I care not a ſtraw, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> neither for him nor his victories: He would oblige me much more if he would forget me. For Gods ſake, Madam, ſaid <hi>Leonide,</hi> do not ſay ſo; did you but know what a high eſteem both <hi>Merovia</hi> and <hi>Childerick</hi> have of him, I cannot thinke but you would ſet a higher value upon him than upon this Shepheard: A Shepheard that does not love you, but even before your face, ſighs for a Shepheardeſſe who has his heart. You will ſay, perhaps, that all this I ſay is ſaid out of ſome cunning Artifice. It is very true, anſwered <hi>Galathea.</hi> Well Madam, anſwered ſhe, you may think and ſay what you pleaſe, but I doe ſwear unto you by all that's ſacred, that what I told you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Impoſtor <hi>Climanthes,</hi> and the crafty <hi>Polemas,</hi> is moſt true. <hi>Leonide</hi> (ſaid <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea)</hi> you doe but loſe your time: I am fully reſolved what to doe, and therefore talke no more. I ſhall do, Madam (ſaid <hi>Leonide)</hi> as you command me, if you will give me but leave to ask you one queſtion, and it is this, What do you intend to do with this Shepheard? I will have him love me, anſwered ſhe. How, I beſeech you, do you think this love will end, ſaid <hi>Leonide?.</hi> How eager you are, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> to know future events? Let him but once love me, and we will afterwards ſee how it will end. Although we cannot know fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture events, ſaid <hi>Leonide,</hi> yet every one does propoſe unto themſelves an end at which they aym. I have no other end, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> but that of Love, nor aym at any thing elſe, but that he ſhould love me. That certainly is all that you can aim at, replyed <hi>Leonide;</hi> for there is no likelyhood you ſhould ever marry him; and if you ſhould not marry him, what then will become of your honour? Your honour, I ſay, which you have ever been ſo tender of, will be extreamly endangered. This new affection cannot ſurely ſo blinde you, but you muſt needs ſee what wrong you do yourſelf, to have a man your Lover, whom you would not have your Husband. And you, <hi>Leonide,</hi> ſaid ſhe you that make ſuch a ſcruple of it, have you any deſire to marry him? I? Madam, anſwered ſhe, I beſeech you; do you think me ſo low in my own thoughts, as to look upon ſuch a ſilly fellow as he? But if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver there were a man that was within the compaſs of cauſing me to love, the reſpect I owed you, made me retreat if I did love him. When? ſaid <hi>Galathea.</hi> Do you remember Madam, anſwered <hi>Leonida,</hi> when you commanded me to make no more account of <hi>Polemas?</hi> Oh, very well remembred to no purpoſe, ſaid <hi>Galathea;</hi> But did you never love <hi>Celadon?</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, anſwered ſhe, I doe not love <hi>Celadon</hi> any otherwiſe than as a Brother; and in that ſhe ſaid true; for ſince the Shepheard and ſhe had the laſt diſcourſe, ſhe reſolved to change her love into friendſhip. Well <hi>Leonide,</hi> ſaid the Nymph, let's leave this diſcourſe both of him and <hi>Lindamor,</hi> for we have had too much of it. But what anſwer, ſaid ſhe, will you return to <hi>Lindamor?</hi> Nothing, ſaid ſhe, but ſilence. Muſt hee then whom he ſent hither, ſaid ſhe, return without any anſwer? Let him take his own courſe, ſaid <hi>Galathea.</hi> As for me, I am fully reſolved, that neither for his ſake, nor any others, will I make myſelf miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Is it not neceſſary then ſaid <hi>Leonide,</hi> that <hi>Flurial</hi> comeback? No, ſaid ſhe. <hi>Leonide</hi> then told her that there was a young man who deſired to ſpeak with <hi>Silvia,</hi> and that ſhee thought it was from <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> becauſe he would deliver his Meſſage unto none but <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> herſelf. Then tell him where ſhe is, ſaid the Nymph; we need but draw the Curtains of <hi>Celadons</hi> Bed; for I doe aſſure my ſelfe he will bee glad to hear what <hi>Ligdamon</hi> hath writ, ſince I beleeve you have already acquainted him with their love. 'Tis very true, ſaid <hi>Leonide</hi> but <hi>Silvia</hi> is of ſuch a haughty ſpirit, that I am confident ſhe will be much offended, if this Meſſenger ſhould ſpeake unto her before <hi>Celadon.</hi> Let it ſurpriſe her, ſaid
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53526:90"/>
                  <hi>Galathea,</hi> and go you before to bid the Shepheard, that he ſpeak not, and draw the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, whilſt I conduct the meſſenger into the Chamber. Thus theſe Nymphs went out, and <hi>Galathea,</hi> remembring ſhe had ſeen this man with <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> asked, From whence he came, and how his Maſter did; alſo, what newes he brought from him? I come, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam ſaid he, from <hi>Merovea's</hi> Army; and as for any thing from my Maſter, I have it in my Commiſſion to tell it only unto <hi>Silvia.</hi> You are very cloſe it ſeemes, ſaid <hi>Galathea;</hi> But do you think, that I will permit you to ſay any thing unto my Nymphs, unknown to me? Madam, ſaid he, I will deliver my meſſage before you, if you pleaſe, for I had it ſo in command eſpecially before <hi>Leonida.</hi> Come then, ſaid the Nymph: And ſo they came into <hi>Celadon's</hi> Chamber, where <hi>Leonida</hi> had before ſet all things in order, not acquainting <hi>Silvia</hi> with it, who, at firſt, was aſtoniſhed; but afterwards, ſeeing <hi>Galathea</hi> with the young man, ſhe preſently imagined, that it was to keep <hi>Celadon</hi> from being ſeen. <hi>Silvia's</hi> ſurpriſe was very great, when ſhe ſaw <hi>Egides,</hi> for ſo was the young man called, whom ſhe knew preſently for though ſhe was not down-right in love with <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> yet was ſhe not exempted from much good-will unto him; ſhe did imagine, that he brought ſome newes from him, yet would not ask him. But <hi>Galathea</hi> addreſſing herſelfe to the man: If you will deliver your meſſage unto <hi>Silvia,</hi> ſaid ſhe, here you may, ſince ſhe and <hi>Leonida</hi> are both here. Madam, ſaid <hi>Egides,</hi> addreſſing unto <hi>Silvia, Ligdamon</hi> my Maſter, and the moſt faithfull of all the Servants which your merits acquired, hath commanded me to acquaint you with the ſtate of his fortune deſiring nothing elſe from heaven in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his fidelity, but that your heart might be moved unto ſome ſparks of pitty, though Love could never come neer the Ice of it. What, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> and interrupted him, you ſpeak, as if he had made his Will: How does he? Madam, ſaid the man, addreſſing unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> I ſhall tell you, if you will pleaſe to give me leave: Then addreſſing himſelfe unto <hi>Silvia,</hi> he began thus.</p>

                  <hi>The Hiſtory of</hi> Ligdamon.</head>
               <p>AFter <hi>Ligdamon</hi> had taken his leave of you, he departed with <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to himſelfe, to obtain that by this voyage, which his ſervices could not do at home; hoping either ſo to ſignalize his nameby his acts of valour, that he might become agreeable unto you; or elſe in dying, to make you grieve for his loſſe. In this deſigne, they came into the Army of <hi>Merovea,</hi> a Prince adorned with all Perfections requiſite in a Conquerour; and came ſo opportunely, as the Battle was to be fought the ſeventh day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo as all the young Cavalrie had no other cares, but to burniſh up their Armes, and get their horſes in good order. But it is not of them I am to ſpeak, therefore paſſing all them over in ſilence, only what relates unto <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> give me therefore leave to tell you, that the aſſigned day of Battle being come, the two Armies drew out of their Camps, and in ſight of each other ranked themſelves into Battalia. Here a Squadron of Horſe, there a Battalion of Foot; here the Drums, there the Trumpets; on one ſide the neighing of Horſes, on the other ſide the voices of men, did make ſuch a noiſe, as if <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>llona</hi> had roared in the field, and diſplayed her moſt horrid Banners. As for me, I never having been before in the like ſervice, I was ſo deaſned with the noiſe, and dazled with the ſhining of Armes, that the truth is, I knew not where I was; yet my reſolution ever was, not to abandon my Maſter, though nothing was to be ſeen but Engines of Death. But, all this was nothing, compared to that horrible confuſion, when all theſe Squadrons met, and when the word of Combat was given.</p>
               <p>The Cavalrie and Infantry: Men, Armes, Horſes, and Engines, made a moſt affrighting thunder. After we had received ſeverall clouds of Arrowes, I cannot tell you, how I came to be with my Maſter in the midſt of his enemies, where I did nothing but admire the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of his ſword. I ſwear, fair Nymph, one wonder makes me forget another, ſo many did <hi>Ligdamon</hi> perform; and ſuch was his valour, that <hi>Merovea</hi> deſired to know his name, having obſerved him above all the reſt of the Cavaliers. The firſt Squadron was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready victorious, and ours rallied to fall upon the ſecond, when the Enemy with his whole Body marched upon them, and ſo ſuddenly, that <hi>Merovea</hi> could not relieve them in time. And certainly, if he had found a Captain leſſe experienced than this, he had ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected his deſigne: But this great Souldier, imagining the deſpair of his Adverſary, ſent preſently three freſh Squadrons, two, unto the two wings, and the third in the arrear of the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53526:91"/>
firſt; and ſo well, as they ſuſtained a great part of the firſt ſhock; yet we, who were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, were much oppreſſed with numbers. At the ſame time, both Bodies of Infantry being joyned, that of <hi>Merovea</hi> had the better; and look, how much we gained ground upon the Horſe, ſo much the Infantry of the Enemy loſt. So it was, that upon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies firſt Charge, many of our men were troden down, beſides thoſe whom Arrowes had at the firſt un-Horſed; amongſt the reſt, <hi>Clidaman</hi> was one, his Horſe being killed under him with an Arrow. <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> who ever had an eye upon him, aſſoon as he ſaw him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, did ride up, and lay about him ſo couragiouſly, that he made a Wall of dead bodies about <hi>Clidaman,</hi> who, in the mean time, had leaſure to recover himſelfe from under his Horſe, and who doubtleſſe, without my Maſters help and valour, had been tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to pieces; for <hi>Ligdamon</hi> lighted from his Horſe, and ſet <hi>Clidaman</hi> on the back of him, whilſt he himſelfe was ſo wounded and preſſed with enemies, that he could not get upon that Horſe which I led. Now was our party forced to recoile, wanting the invincible Arme of my Maſter; and we were in ſuch a deſperate condition, and we were amidſt ſo many enemies, as there was no hopes of any life. However, <hi>Ligdamon</hi> would never render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and though he was wounded and weary, yet there was not an enemy, ſeeing what deadly blowes came from his Arme, that was ſo bold as to lay hold of him: At the laſt, five or ſix came galloping up with all their fury, and he having run his ſword into the firſt Horſe, it broke at the very bilt, and the horſe, being run through the heart, fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: I ran to help him up, but halfe a ſcore more that was fallen upon him, hindred me. Thus both of us halfe dead, were carried away; and the accident was the more dyla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous, becauſe almoſt at the very ſame time, our Party recovered what they had loſt, by the reliefe which <hi>Childerick</hi> brought from the Rear guard, and were Maſters of the Field, burning all the enemies Hutts, moſt part of them being taken or killed. As for us, we were carried unto their principall City, called <hi>Rhotomages,</hi> where my Maſter was no ſooner arrived, but many came to viſit him; ſome ſaid, they were his Coſens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others his friends, though he knew not one of them: For my part, I knew neither what to ſay nor think of it, when I ſaw ſo many ſtrangers carraſſing, and making ſo very much of him: yet much more was our amazement, when a Lady, well attended, came to viſit him, ſaying, he was her Son, with ſo many demonſtrations of affection, as he was almoſt out of himſelfe; and much more, when ſhe ſaid, Oh <hi>Lydias</hi> my Child, how great are both my joyes and fears, at the ſight of you in this place? Alas! how am I afraid to ſee you in this cruell Town, ſince your enemy <hi>Arontes,</hi> is dead of thoſe wounds which you gave him, and ſince you are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to death by Juſtice? For my part, I know no other way but to ranſome you preſently, and hide you, till you be able to get away. <hi>Ligdamon</hi> was extreamly amazed at all this, and knew that he was taken for ſome other; but he could not anſwer her, becauſe at the very ſame inſtant, he who took him, came into the Chamber, with two Officers of the Town, to take a liſt of the names and qualities of the Priſoners; for many being taken they intended to exchange them. The poor Lady was much affrighted, thinking they came to ſeize upon him, and carry him to Priſon; and hearing them ask his name, ſhe told them her ſelfe but my Maſter ſaid, his name was <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> a <hi>Seguſian:</hi> She had an opinion, that he would diſſemble his name; and to remove all ſuſpicion, went preſently to her houſe, with a reſolution to ranſome him before he was known. The truth was my Maſter did ſo reſemble <hi>Lydias,</hi> that every one did take him for the ſame. This <hi>Lydias</hi> was a young Gallant of that Country, and being in love with a great Beauty, had fought with <hi>Arontes,</hi> his Rivall, and killed him, yet had time enough to eſcape the hands of Juſtice; but, after the death of <hi>Arontes,</hi> was ſo proſecuted by his friends, that <hi>Lydias,</hi> though abſent, was condemned to death. <hi>Ligdamon</hi> was ſo wounded that he could not think of theſe things. I foreſeeing what danger might enſure, ſtill preſſed the Mother to ranſome him, which ſhe did, yet not ſo ſecretly, but the Enemies of <hi>Lydias</hi> were acquainted with it; ſo as the very ſame day that this good Lady paid the ranſome, and carried him to her houſe, the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of Juſtice came and carried him to Priſon, ſay what <hi>Ligdamon</hi> could. Thus being by every one taken for <hi>Lydias,</hi> he was in very great danger: but much more the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning when he was examined upon ſuch interrogatories, of which he was ſo ignorant, that he knew not what to anſwer. However, the Judges perſiſted in their former judgment, and confirmed it, giving him no longer term than the healing of his wounds. The noiſe was preſently all about the Town, that <hi>Lydias</hi> was a Priſoner, and condemned to die, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a Murderer, but as a Rebell, being taken in Armes for the <hi>Franks;</hi> and therefore, as the cuſtome of that time and place was, for ſuch an offence, he was to be put into a Den
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53526:91"/>
of Lions; nothing elſe was talked of through all the Town: At laſt, it came to my ears; upon which I diſguiſed my ſelfe, and with the help of that good Lady, who had paid his ranſome, I came to <hi>Paris,</hi> unto <hi>Merovea</hi> and <hi>Childerick,</hi> whom I acquainted with the accident at which they were much aſtoniſhed, thinking it almoſt impoſſible, two perſons ſhould reſemble ſo much as to finde no difference; but to prevent any danger, they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent two Heraulds of Armes, to acquaint the enemy with their errour. But all this conduced to no purpoſe, but confirmed them in their opinion, and rather haſted the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Sentence than otherwiſe. The wounds of <hi>Ligdamon</hi> were now healed, ſo as they pronounced the Sentence, That he ſhould die by Lions, which ſhould be his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners; yet, being of a noble Family, they would do him ſo much favour, as to let him wear his Sword and Dagger, as Armes belonging to a Cavalier; with which, if he had ſo much courage, he might defend himſelfe, or at leaſt, generouſly revenge his death. At that time they returned unto <hi>Merovea,</hi> that thus they alwaies puniſhed their own Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who were Traitors unto their Country. Thus ſee poor <hi>Ligdamon</hi> in moſt pittifull danger; yet, his Courage that never fainted, unleſſe in matters of Love, ſeeing there was no other remedy, reſolved to defend himſelfe as well as he could. <hi>Lydias</hi> being one of the beſt Families of the <hi>Neuſtrians,</hi> almoſt all the Citty aſſembled to behold this Spectacle. When he was ready to be put into this cloſe horrour, his only requeſt was, that he might fight with theſe Lions one after another. The people hearing this juſt demand, did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it by their acclamations and clapping of hands, in ſpite of the proſecutors. Now, ſee <hi>Ligdamon</hi> alone in a great Court, and the Lions ſeeing their prey through ſome Bars, did roar ſo horridly, as would have chilled the blood of any, but him; who taking notice which dore firſt opened, leſt he ſhould be ſurpriſed, he ſaw a huge hungry Lion come out, who at the firſt, pawing with his foot upon the ground, and ſtriking himſelfe with his taile, he began to ſtretch forth his paw, and open his clawes, as if he would ſhew him what death he ſhould die. <hi>Ligdamon</hi> ſeeing no ſafety but in his own valour, aſsoon as ever he ſaw him begin to walk, he darted his Dagger ſo dexterouſly to the Lions breaſt, as the point of it pierced his heart, and the beaſt fell dead immediately. Great was the ſhout of the people! for every one obſerving his courageous behaviour, his valour and dexterity, they did wiſh him well in their very hearts. But he, that knew the ſeverity of the Judges would not be thus ſatisfied, he ran preſently to take his Dagger again, which he had no ſooner got into his hand, but another Lion, no leſſe furious then the firſt, came running furiouſly upon him, ſo as <hi>Ligdamon</hi> was like to be ſurpriſed, but he ſtepped a little aſide out of this raging Animal's full carrier, and cut him over the eyes; upon which, the furious beaſt turned ſo ſhort upon him, that <hi>Ligdamon</hi> ſtepping back to fetch another blow, he fell; but ſo, that in falling, the Lion coming over him, he ran him into the belly, and ſo mortally, as he fell dead as ſoon as the firſt did. Whilſt <hi>Ligdamon</hi> was thus fighting for his life, a Lady, one of the faireſt of all the <hi>Neuſtrians,</hi> kneeled down before the Judges, beſeeching them to ſtay Execution untill ſhe had ſpoken unto them; her name was <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina,</hi> the very ſame for whom <hi>Lydias</hi> had killed <hi>Arontes,</hi> and who, though much aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, yet, ſpake thus unto the Judges: Sirs, Ingratitude is a ſin as great as Treaſon, and I deſerve a puniſhment as great as his, did I not ſave his life, as he formerly ventured his to ſave my honour. Therefore I do preſent my ſelf before you, and claim the Priviledge, which is, That any condemned Perſon ſhall be delivered, if any Virgin do come and ask him for her Husband: Aſſoon as I heard of your judgment, I came with as much haſte as I could, to demand him; and ſince I am now come yet in the nick of time, I hope you will not deny me juſtice, and him to be my Husband. The people hearing this, ſhouted for joy, and cryed, Favour, Favour; and though the enemies of <hi>Lydias</hi> did urge the contrary, yet it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the Priviledge ſhould be obſerved: But alas! <hi>Ligdamon</hi> came out of one danger, to enter into another, and greater; for being brought before the Judges, they let him underſtand the cuſtom of the Country, which was ſuch, That any man who was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for any crime, ſhould be releaſed from execution of Juſtice, if any Virgin came and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him for her husband: ſo as if he would marry <hi>Amerina,</hi> he ſhould be releaſed to live with her. <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> who did not know her was extreamly put to it for an anſwer: Yet ſeeing no other remedy to avoid the danger wherein he was, he promiſed that he would, hoping that time would finde out ſome expedient to get out of this Labyrinth. <hi>Amerina,</hi> who knew that <hi>Lydias</hi> alwaies loved her, was not a little amuſed to ſee him ſo faint &amp; cold in the buſineſſe; yet thinking that the terror of the danger in which he was had made him ſo, ſhe pittyed him the more, and carried him into the houſe of <hi>Lydias</hi> Mother, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53526:92"/>
this Marriage, knowing there was no other way to ſave her Sons life, which cauſed her to preſſe on this Marriage as ſoon as it was poſſible, thinking that it would the more pleaſe her Sonne, whom ſhe knew was in love with <hi>Amerina.</hi> But, alaſs, all this was to haſten his death. Oh my dear Maſter, When I think upon thy laſt words which you ſpake unto me, I cannot chuſe but wonder, how it is poſſible I ſhould live. All things being ready for the Marriage, and the time of Ceremony being come, he took me aſide, and ſaid thus unto me; Oh <hi>Egides,</hi> my friend, Didſt thou ever ſee ſuch a peece of Fortune as this, that they would make me beleeve I am not my ſelf? Sir, ſaid I unto unto him, me-thinks your fortune is not bad; <hi>Amerina</hi> is fair and rich, every one ſayes her Parents are of the beſt Families in all the Country, What can you deſire more? Oh <hi>Egides,</hi> ſaid he, thou talkeſt merrily; but didſt thou know the condition I am in, thou wouldſt pitty me: I know thy fidelity, and therefore I truſt and conjure thee to carry this Letter unto the fair <hi>Silvia,</hi> and tell her all thou haſt ſeen: And tell her further, that I did never love any but her, nor will I ever love any other: Upon theſe words hee gave mee this Letter, which I have carefully kept ever ſince that morning when he went unto the Temple, and when he called me, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me ſwear again, that I would the next day come in all haſte unto you; Then came a Meſſenger to conduct him to the Nuptial Chariot, in which <hi>Amerina</hi> already was, with one of her Uncles, whom ſhee honoured as her Father. Shee fate in the middle betwixt <hi>Ligdamon</hi> and <hi>Cariſtes</hi> (ſo was her Uncle called). Before the Chariot went all their own Family, and after it followed their Kindred, Friends, and Allies. In this Triumph went they unto the Temple, and when they came there, they were led up to the Altar of <hi>Hymen,</hi> upon which five Torches were lighted; on the right ſide of <hi>Hymen</hi> was placed <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Juno,</hi> on the left ſide <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Diana:</hi> As for <hi>Hymen,</hi> he was crowned with Flowers and ſweet Marjerome, held in his right hand a Torch, and in his left, a Vail, of the ſame colour of <hi>Amarine's.</hi> When they came firſt into the Temple, the Mother of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias</hi> and <hi>Amarine</hi> lighted their Torches. Then the chiefe <hi>Druide</hi> comming unto them, addreſſed his ſpeech unto my Maſter, and asked him this queſtion: <hi>Lydias,</hi> will you have <hi>Amarine</hi> to be the Mother of your Family? It was long before <hi>Ligdamon</hi> would ſpeak; but at laſt, he was forced to ſay, Yes. Then the Druide turning towards her: And you <hi>Amarina,</hi> Will you have <hi>Lydias</hi> for the Father of your Family? And ſhe anſwering, Yes, he then taking their hands, and putting them together, he ſaid: And I, in the ſteed of the great gods, do give you one unto another; for ever after, eat your bread together. And then taking the Barley-cake, my Maſter broke it, and, according to the cuſtome, they did eat of it together. Now there reſted no more to be done to compleat the Ceremony, but to take the Wine and drink: Then he turned towards me, and ſaid: I do conjure you, Friend, as the beſt ſervice you ever did me, to give me the Cup: Which I did, and alas, too ſoon. Aſſoon as he had it in his hand, he ſaid in a loud voice: O ye great gods, who know that I am not <hi>Lydias,</hi> do not revenge my death upon this fair Lady, whoſe errour, in taking me for ſome other, more happy than my ſelfe, hath redeemed me from one kinde of death, to give me unto another: Upon this word, he drank up all that was in the Cup; which was contrary to the Cuſtome, for the Husband ſhould have drunk one halfe, and the Wife the other: Upon which, ſhe ſmiled, and ſaid unto him: It ſeemes, <hi>Lydias,</hi> you have forgot the Cuſtome, for you ſhould have left me a part. God forbid, wiſe <hi>Amarina,</hi> ſaid he, for it is poyſon, which I have choſen to finiſh my life withall, rather then fail in my promiſe to you, and in my affection which I owe unto the fair <hi>Silvia.</hi> Oh my god, ſaid ſhe is this poſſible? And then thinking that he was
<hi>Lydias,</hi> but that during his abſence, he had changed his minde, and not deſiring to live without him, ſhe ran with the Cup in her hand to the Bottle, where the poyſoned wine was, and before <hi>Ligdamon</hi> was aware, had drunk it off; for the Apothecary, whom <hi>Ligdamon</hi> had prepared had filled the Bottle full: Afterwards returning to him, ſhe ſaid; You cruell man, had rather have death then me, and I, rather then be without you. Oh <hi>Amerina,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> I confeſſe, that I had offended, if I had been him you took me for: but, believe me, now I am upon my laſt breath, I am not <hi>Lydias,</hi> but <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> and time will diſcover the error: However, I chooſe death, rather then break my promiſe made unto the fair <hi>Silvia,</hi> unto whom I have conſecrated my life, ſince I am not able to ſatisfy both. Then he continued: Oh faireſt <hi>Silvia</hi> accept of this good will I now offer unto thee, and of all my actions, let this laſt be beſt received, ſince it is imprinted with the noble character of Fidelity. The Poyſon now began to work by degrees upon the ſpirits of theſe two new-marryed perſons, ſo as he could hardly breathe, when turning his head towards me, he ſaid, Go, go, my friend, go,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53526:92"/>
and do thy buſineſſe, relate what thou haſt ſeen, and that death is more welcome unto me than life, which would have ſtained that Fidelity, which I have vowed unto the fair <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via. Silvia</hi> was the laſt word he ever ſpake, for as he uttered it, his Soul departed out of his Body into the <hi>Elizian</hi> fields, where if ever any Lover was happy, it is he, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſeeing you there with him. Is it then certainly true, (ſaid <hi>Silvia)</hi> that <hi>Ligdamon</hi> is dead? Alas! too true, anſwered he. Oh ye gods! cryed out <hi>Silvia.</hi> All ſhe was able to do, was, to lie down upon the bed, for her heart quite failed her; where after ſhe had been awhile, ſhe called for <hi>Leonida,</hi> to take <hi>Ligdamon's</hi> Letter, and to tell <hi>Egides,</hi> that ſhe would have him ſerve her. Thus <hi>Egides</hi> with-drew, with eyes ſwimming in tears. Now did Love ſhew his power; for this Nymph, who never much loved <hi>Ligdamon</hi> alive, now ſhe heard of his death, ſhe expreſſed as much griefe, as was poſſible for any Lover. Upon this occaſion, <hi>Galathea</hi> talking unto <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſhe ſaid, That hereafter ſhe would think it impoſſible, that a woman ſhould never in her life love any one; for, ſaid ſhe, this Nymph hath been too cruell unto all thoſe that loved her, that ſome have dyed for very griefe, others have been baniſhed out of her ſight by deſpair; and this very man, whom ſhe now la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for, ſhe did heretofore drive into ſuch extremity, that but for <hi>Leonida,</hi> he had then dyed alſo ſo as I durſt have ſworn, Love would have ſooner harboured in the moſt ſnowie part of the <hi>Alps,</hi> than in her heart; and yet you may ſee, unto what ſhe is reduced now. Do not think this to be Love, Madam, ſaid <hi>Celadon,</hi> but rather Pitty; for, ſhe had been the hardeſt piece of Marble that ever was, had ſhe not been extreamly perplexed at this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. For my part I think <hi>Ligdamon</hi> more happy, than if he were alive, ſince he loved this Nymph ſo extreamly, and ſhe was ſo hard hearted unto him: For what greater hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe can be, then to be at the end of miſery, and to enter into felicity? How joyed would he be, to ſee <hi>Silvia</hi> mourn for him, and ſet a value upon his affection? No, no, Madam, <hi>Ligdamon</hi> is not to be mourned for ſo much, as <hi>Silvia;</hi> for you ſhall ſee, that all her minde and fancy will run upon <hi>Ligdamon:</hi> The diſcourſe, the garb, the affection, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and briefly, every action of this Lover, will, in revenge of her cruelty, continually torment her minde, and will in revenge, be the Executioner of Love's juſtice. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was ſpoken ſo loud, and ſo neer <hi>Silvia,</hi> that ſhe heard it all, and it did but increaſe her griefe: ſo as ſhe went out of this Chamber into her own, where ſhe could no longer reſtrain her tears: for, ſhutting the dore after her, and deſiring <hi>Leonida</hi> to leave her, ſhe threw her ſelfe upon the bed, where, with watry eyes, and folded armes, ſhe called to minde all the former life of <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> how great his love was, how patiently he endured all her rigour, with what diſcretion he ſerved her, how conſtant he was in his love, and in the end, ſaid ſhe, all this is now encloſed in a little piece of earth. Then calling to minde her own demeanor, her diſcourſes, her farewells, her impatiencies, and a thouſand more particulars, ſhe was forced to ſay, Oh fatall memory, let the aſhes of my dear <hi>Ligdamon</hi> reſt in peace; if thou doſt torment me thus, I know he will not be contented with it. At laſt, after ſhe had been a while mute; Well, ſaid ſhe, it is reſolved upon, be my life long or ſhort, as it ſhall pleaſe the Fates, I will never ceaſe loving my dear <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> nor forget his affection or vertues. <hi>Galathea</hi> in the mean while opened <hi>Ligdamon's</hi> Letter, which was in <hi>Leonida's</hi> hands, and found in it theſe words.</p>

               <p>It is moſt true, anſwered <hi>Galathea,</hi> Love never ſuffers an offence committed againſt him, to eſcape unpuniſhed; and hence it is, we ſee ſo many ſtrange accidents in all human acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And therefore <hi>Celadon,</hi> I wonder that you po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not tremble for feare, and every moment expect an Arrow of revenge from that god. Why ſhould I fear, ſaid the Shepheard, ſince it is I that am the offended party? Ah <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſaid the Nymph, were all things equally ballanced, you would finde your offences committed much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then thoſe you have received. This is the very height of miſery, ſaid <hi>Celadon,</hi> that a perſon afflicted ſhould be thought happy, and when his pain is palpable, yet not to be pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied. But I pray tell me, Shepheard, ſaid the Nymph, does not Ingratitude, of all crimes and offences that are accounted great, hold the firſt place? Doubtleſſe it does, anſwered the Shepheard. If it do, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> how can you clear your ſelfe, ſince for all the love and affection I have ſhewed unto you, I receive nothing but a hollow faintneſſe and diſdain from you? This for all; conſidering what I am, and conſidering what you are, I cannot conceive, how I have any waies offended againſt Love, that he ſhould puniſh me with ſo much rigour. <hi>Celadon</hi> was extreamly ſorry for beginning this diſcourſe; but ſince it was already on foot, he reſolved to clear himſelfe, and therefore ſaid thus unto her: Madam, I know not how to give an anſwer unto your ſpeeches, but by bluſhes; yet Love, which makes you ſpeak, conſtraines me to anſwer. That which you call ingratitude in me, I muſt call Duty; and if you ſhall pleaſe to ask me my reaſon, I ſhall give it. What reaſon can you give, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> unleſſe that you do love another, and that your faith is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to her? But let me tell you, that the Law of Nature is before all others, and that Law commands us, to ſeek and prefer our own good before anothers: And can you deſire a greater good than my affection? Whom have you in the Country like me, who can do as I can for you? Theſe are meer mockeries, <hi>Celadon,</hi> to inſiſt ſo much upon theſe follies of Fidelity and Conſtancy; termes invented only by old women and ugly to keep ſuch within their Pales, as their faces has ſet at liberty. They ſay, all the Vertues are chained together; Conſtancy cannot be without Prudence: And can it be any Prudence to let go a certain good, only to avoid the bare name and title of Inconſtant? Madam, (anſwered <hi>Celadon)</hi> Prudence never taught us to thrive by any ſhamefull means; nor did the Lawes of Nature ever command us to build, before we have a ſure foundation. Is there any thing more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt and ſhamefull, than not to obſerve and be punctuall in promiſes? Is there any thing fuller of levity, than a Minde, that like a Bee, flying from flower to flower, is ſtill in queſt of new ſweetneſſe? If Fidelity be once loſt, Madam, what ſure foundation can I have in your affection? Since you follow the Law which you ſpeak of, I ſhall remain no longer in this happineſſe, then you ſtay in a place, where there is no Man, but my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The Nymph and the Shepheard diſcourſed thus, whilſt <hi>Leonida</hi> went into her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to diſpatch a Letter unto <hi>Lindamor,</hi> which was, to invite him home with all haſte,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53526:93"/>
otherwiſe to deſpair for ever: And the next morning, when <hi>Flurial</hi> came again, after ſhe had given him her Letter, ſhe ſaid thus unto him: Go <hi>Flurial,</hi> let thy love to <hi>Lindamor</hi> be ſeen in thy haſte; for delay may be no leſſe then death unto him. Go, or rather, flie; bid him return with all ſpeed, and in his return, go ſtraight to the houſe of <hi>Adamas,</hi> whom I have gain'd to him; there he ſhall finde the moſt notable treachery in Love that ever was invented; but if it be poſſible, let him come unknown. Thus <hi>Flurial</hi> departed, ſo deſirous to ſerve <hi>Lindamor,</hi> that he would not go unto his Aunts, becauſe he would loſe no time. Thus three or foure daies paſſed on, during which time, <hi>Celadon</hi> began to long for the return of the Druide, in hopes, that when he came, he ſhould then get out of this place; and to make the time ſeem leſſe tedious, he went ſometimes into the Garden, and ſometimes into the Woods; but never without the company of one of the Nymphs, and often all three: <hi>Silvia</hi>'s humour pleaſed him beſt, as moſt ſympathizing with his own, and therefore he courted her as much as he could.</p>
               <p>It hapned one day, being all four together, that they paſſed by the <hi>Grotto</hi> of <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Fortune;</hi> and becauſe the entrance ſeemed to be very fair, and made with much art, the Shepheard asked, what it was? To whom <hi>Gaelathea</hi> anſwered, Will you ſee, Shepheard, one of the greateſt proofes of Love's power, that ever was? What is that, ſaid the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard? It is, ſaid the Nymph, the Loves of <hi>Mandrague</hi> and <hi>Damon;</hi> as for the Shephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe <hi>Fortune,</hi> that is ordinary. Who is that <hi>Mandrague,</hi> ſaid the Shepheard? If one may know what the Worker is, by the Work, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> you will finde her to be one of the greateſt Magicians in all <hi>Gaul;</hi> for 'twas ſhe, who by her enchantments, made this <hi>Grotto,</hi> and many other Rarities that are within it. Then entring in, the Shepheard was raviſhed with the curioſity of the work; the entrance was very high and ſpacious; on both ſides, in lie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Pillars, were great Statues, which with their ſhoulders, ſupported the Arches of the Portall: The one repreſented <hi>Pan,</hi> the other <hi>Syringes,</hi> which were moſt induſtriouſly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into hair, veines, eye-browes, and beard; alſo the hornes of <hi>Pan</hi> were excellently wrought: The Arch without was of Ruſtick work, and the Vault, both without and within, was adorned with abundance of excellent Statues, which being hollow within, conveyed water into ſeverall Fountains, and every one of them repreſented ſome effect of the puiſſance of Love. In the midſt of the <hi>Grotto</hi> was a Tombe, ſome twelve or fourteen foot high; and all about it hung ſuch pictures, as the ſight of them deceived the judgment: The ſpace betwixt every piece was filled up with a Demi-columne of black poliſhed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and at the top was a Corniſh of white Marble, unto which the ſeverall pictures were chained. After <hi>Celadon</hi> had contemplated them in generall, he was ſo full of curioſity, as he deſired to know more of the particulars, and therefore to give an occaſion to the Nymph to ſay ſomething more upon every part, he commended the Invention and Art of the worker. Theſe are the ſpirits of <hi>Mandrague,</hi> (ſaid the Nymph) who were left here, to teſtifie, that Love does not pardon either old or young, fair or foul; and to relate unto thoſe who come hither, the unfortunate Loves of <hi>Damon</hi> and ſhe, and of the Shephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe <hi>Fortune.</hi> But, ſaid <hi>Celadon,</hi> is this the Fountain of Love's Verity? No, ſaid the Nymph, but that is not far from hence: But would I had ſo much ingenuitie, as to interpret theſe Pictures unto you, for the ſtory is very well worthy of your knowledge. As ſhe was beginning to expound them, ſhe ſaw <hi>Adamas</hi> enter, who being returned, and not finding the Nymphs within, imagined that they were gone to walk; and after he had hid the clothes which he brought, he came after them. <hi>Galathea</hi> no ſooner ſaw him, but ſhe cryed out, Oh Father, you are come in excellent good time to help me out; and then addreſſing unto <hi>Celadon,</hi> Here's one, Shepheard, ſaid ſhe, that will ſatisfie you in the ſtory of theſe Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures. Then after ſhe had asked him how he did, and after ſalutations on all parts, <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> in obedience to the Nymphs commands, and to ſatisfie the Shepheards curioſity, going with them neer the Tomb he began thus.</p>

This young Shepheard fed his Flock upon the banks of <hi>Lignon,</hi> deſcended from one of the beſt Families about Mount <hi>Verdam,</hi> and nor far off in kindred from the old <hi>Cleontine,</hi> and <hi>Leonida's</hi> Mother, ſo conſequently my Allie. Obſerve how his face, beſides the beauty of it, does lively repreſent a perſon, whoſe cares are only to content himſelfe; for you cannot finde the leaſt cloudy imagination in his brow. Then on the contrary, remove your eye, and obſerve thoſe Shepheardeſſes that are about him, then you will judge by their compoſure of face, that they are not without much paines: For, as <hi>Damon's</hi> ſpirit is quiet and free, ſo theſe Shepheardeſſes have hearts extreamly paſſionate towards him; and yet you ſee, he will not daigne to beſtow a look upon them: And therefore there is placed by him on the right hand, that little boy, with a Bow, and a Torch in his hand, his eyes bound up, his back winged, and upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders a Quiver. This is Love, who being much offended at the diſdain of this Shepheard to theſe Shepheardeſſes does ſwear that he will be revenged of him.

                  <p>LOok here upon your pleaſant River of <hi>Lignon,</hi> ſee how it has a double ſource, the one comming from the Mountaines of <hi>Cervieres,</hi> and the other from the <hi>Chilmaſell</hi> hills, and meet a little below the Merchants Town of <hi>Boinge.</hi> How well the Channell is drawn? how the River runs crooked, and the banks full of Offers? Do you not know the Wood there, which joynes to the great Plain, where the Shepheards uſe to feed their Flocks? If that tuft of Trees on the left hand, where the River cringles it ſelfe like unto a Serpent, and makes a halfe Moon in another, ſeem ſtrange unto your eye, and is not ſo at this houre, you muſt know, that the Picture notwithſtanding is true; for ſince it was drawn, ſome Trees are decayed, others cut down, and others growne in their room. Then look a little lower the River, and behold a flock of ſheep feeding in the ſhade; that is the flock of <hi>Damon,</hi> whom you may ſee there in the River up to the Middle: Obſerve how that young copps of Trees do bid reſiſtance to the Sun, and as it were, rejoyce, that they have another under them and yet, ſuch is the piercing curioſity of the Sun, that it findes a paſſage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſome leaves, for ſome of its rayes: Take notice how well the ſhade and the rayes are repreſented. But certain it is, that the Shepheard cannot be ſurpaſſed in beauty; look wel upon the delicate proportion and ſymmetry of his face; his tall and proper ſtature; and ſee how every part is painted in the height of perfection; although he ſtoopes a little to reach the water, and with his right arme waſheth his left, yet for all that, you may eaſily perceive his perfect beauty. Then caſt your eye upon the other ſide of the River, and there you may behold uglineſſe in its height, as on this ſide you did beauty: for there amongſt thoſe dirty Ruſhes, you may ſee the Sorcerene <hi>Mandrague,</hi> looking upon the Shepheard as he is bathing himſelfe; ſee how ſhe is dreſt, as it were, in ſpite of thoſe that look upon her: her rufled hair, her foul and naked arme, and her pittifull petticoat, tucked up higher then her ugly knee: I believe, and ſo would any that ſhe was going to conjure. But ſee here the ſtrange effects of Beauty. This old Hag, with one hip in her grave, with her little, lean, wrinckled, and meager face, and hair as gray as old age could make it; ſhe is not aſhamed to fall in love with this young and lovely Lad: If there be any ſympathy in Love, as they ſay there is, I wonder where it could be betwixt <hi>Damon</hi> and her; look what an extaſy ſhe is in, how ſhe lifts up her hoary head, and withered hands, and intending to ſmile makes a miſerable mouth: But be ſhe as ugly as ſhe is, ſhe intends to love and court this Shepheard. Then lift up your eyes a little higher, and ſee how <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Cupid</hi> in that cloud, looking upon this new Lover do ſeem as if they laughed at it. Certainly this was ſome wager, which that little god had laid with his Mother, that he could make this wither'd ſtump beſtir her ſelfe in Love; or if it were not upon a wager, it was to ſhew by this old hag, that dry wood burnes better and ſooner then green; or elſe, to ſhew his power upon this aged Monument, he would try what heat was in his Torch, with which, it ſeemes, he can inſpire new ſoules; and, in a word, make life revive, and come out of the grave.</p>

                  <p>PAſſe then unto the next, and you ſhall ſee night very well repreſented; See how in that gloomy ſhade, ſome Mountains do a little appear, but ſo, as you can hardly tell what they be. Obſerve how theſe ſtars do ſeem as if they twinkled; there is <hi>Urſa major,</hi> which though it have ſeven and twenty ſtars belonging to it, yet the judicious workman has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented clearly unto us but twelve; and of that twelve, but ſeven that ſhine clear. There again is <hi>Urſa minor;</hi> And conſider, that though all theſe ſeven ſtars do never hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet one of them is of the third Magnitude, and foure of the fourth; and yet to us, they ſeem all of the ſame proportion. There is alſo the <hi>Dragon,</hi> unto which belongs thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and one ſtars; yet thirteen only to be ſeen, five of which are of the fourth Magnitude, and eight of the third. There again is <hi>Adrian's Crown,</hi> which hath in it eight ſtars, whereof one is more ſplendent then the reſt. Behold there the <hi>Milkie way,</hi> by which, the Romans ſay, that the gods uſed to go and come from heaven. How well thoſe clouds are repreſented? how in ſome places they cover the sky with a dusky thickneſſe, in others leſſe,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53526:95"/>
as they are more or leſſe in height, ſo in clearneſſe. Now let us conſider the Story of this Picture: Look upon <hi>Mandrague</hi> in the midſt of a Circle, with a wand in her right hand, and an old worm-eaten book in her left, with a candle of green wax, and a pair of rotten ſpectacles on her noſe; ſee how ſhe ſeemes to mutter her mouth awry, her browes like clouds, and every action ſeemes to groan out her affection: Obſerve how her feet, her arms, her left ſide is naked, being on the ſame ſide with her heart: All thoſe phantaſmes which you ſee about her, are Demons and Spirits, which ſhe conjures up unto her by her charms, to know of them what ſhe ſhould do to make <hi>Damon</hi> love her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They tell her of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto <hi>Fortune,</hi> and that there is no better way, then to tell him, that this Shephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe loves another and not him; and in order to that, it is requiſite, ſhe ſhould preſently change the vertue that is in the Fountain of Loves verity. Before you go any further, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the art of the Drawer; ſee the effects of <hi>Mandrague's</hi> candle in the dark, how light it is on her left ſide, and how dark it is on the other ſide of her face, as if it were two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent complexions. Then ſee what a difference the ſhadow of this candle makes amongſt the Demons, ſome in darkneſſe, ſome in light, as ſhe does turn her ſelfe. Obſerve again the Painters art in drawing his diſtances, ſomethings at hand, and ſome afar off; <hi>Mandrague</hi> here is far off at the Fountain of Loves verity. But for your better underſtanding, be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to know, that a little before, there was a fair Shepheardeſſe, the Daughter of a very cunning Magician, was ſecretly deſperately in love with a Shepheard. Whether it was, that the charmes of Magick had no influence upon the charmes of Love, or that he was ſo attentive upon his ſtudies, that he did not minde her; but ſo it was, that after a moſt extream affection, and diſdain of the Shepheard, ſhe took it ſo to heart, that ſhe dyed, and all her Fathers skill could not help her: At which the Magician being extreamly ſorry when he underſtood the occaſion, to eternize her memory, he changed her Tombe into a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; which he called the Verity of Love, becauſe whoſoever looked in it, he ſhould ſee his Miſtreſſe, and if ſhe did love him, he ſhould ſee her and himſelfe together; and if ſhe did not love any, then ſhe ſhould appear alone. And this is the vertue that <hi>Mandrague</hi> would change, to the end, that when <hi>Damon</hi> came to look into the Fountain, he might finde that his Miſtreſſe loved another, and ſo his affection unto her might die, and ſhe her ſelfe might poſſeſſe it. See how ſhe did inchant it, what Characters ſhe makes about it, what Circles, what Triangles, and od Figures ſhe uſeth. Before ſhe began to conjure, ſhe called all her Divells about her, to her aide; yet Love being ſtronger then all they, they durſt not attempt any thing againſt him, only counſelled her, to betray theſe two faithfull Lovers, and to forbear that qualitie for a certain time. Now ſince the vertue of this Fountain did ſuſt come unto it by a Magician; <hi>Mandrague,</hi> who excelled all her Predeceſsors in that Science, might eaſily obtain that requeſt. But let us paſſe to the next Picture.</p>

                  <head>The fift Picture.</head>
                  <p>THis Piece contains two actions: The firſt is <hi>Damon,</hi> when he came unto this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to be ſatisfied in thoſe doubts into which an angry Dream had put him. The other, when being deceived by the art of <hi>Mandrague,</hi> and ſaw that the Shepheardeſſe <hi>Fortune</hi> loved another, in deſpair, he killed himſelfe. Now let us ſee how theſe things are repreſented: See <hi>Damon</hi> there with his Faulchion, for he was in his hunting equipage; obſerve how his Dog followes him, look how that obſervant Animal eye's his Maſter; for whilſt he looked in the Fountain, the Dog fixed his eye upon him, as if he were deſirous to know what it was which ſo amazed him. <hi>Mandrague</hi> had in a dream let him ſee <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radon,</hi> a young Shepheard, who taking one of <hi>Cupid's</hi> Arrowes, opened <hi>Fortune's</hi> breaſt, and took away her heart. <hi>Damon,</hi> as all Lovers are, being in much doubt, as ſoon as ever he waked, got up, and went to the Fountain, to ſee whether his Miſtreſſe ſtill loved him. I beſeech you obſerve very well his amazement, if you compare his face which is in all the other three Pictures, with this, you ſhall finde a ſtrange alteration. Thoſe two faces which you ſee in the Fountain, is the Shepheardeſſe <hi>Fortune's,</hi> and the other the Shepheard <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radon's,</hi> which the Witch cauſed to be repreſented rather then the other: and ſo <hi>Damon</hi> believed his Shepheardeſſe loved <hi>Maradon,</hi> which beliefe made him reſolve upon death. Do you ſee how the water ſeemes to tremble, that is cauſed by poor <hi>Damon's</hi> tears, that had dropped into it. But let us paſs on to the ſecond Action: The dead man whom you ſee lying upon the ground, is poor <hi>Damon,</hi> who being deſperate, killed himſelf with
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53526:95"/>
his Falchion. His action is very naturally done, with one Arm engaged under his body, being ſurpriſed with the ſuddenneſſe of the fall, and having no ſtrength to recover himſelf; his head hanging over his right ſhoulder, his eyes half ſhut, and half turned upwards; his mouth open, his teeth apparent, and ſo all ſignes of a ſudden death: A man quite dead is not repreſented, but a man betwixt life and death, as if there were a medium. Look how the blood is running out of his wound; I do not think you ever ſaw any thing more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally repreſented. But let us ſee what is in the other peece.</p>

                  <head>The ſixth Picture.</head>
                  <p>NOw be pleas'd to look upon the ſixth and laſt Peece; which containes four actions of the Shepheardeſſe <hi>Fortune:</hi> The firſt is a Dream which <hi>Mandrague</hi> cauſed her to have; The other, how ſhe went unto the Fountain to clear her doubts: The third, how ſhe complains againſt the Inconſtancy of her Shepheard: And the laſt is, how ſhe dies, which is the concluſion of this Tragedy. Let us look upon all theſe particulars: Look upon the Riſing of the Sun, obſerve how long the ſhadows are; how the sky is not ſo clear on the one ſide; ſee how clouds and miſts are expelled; and how thoſe little Birds do dreſſe and prune themſelves againſt its approach. Paſſe your eye a little further, and ſee the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe <hi>Fortune</hi> aſleep in her bed and how the Sun ſhines through the window upon her naked breaſt: Alſo the ſleeve of her ſmock being looſe, the beauty of her Arm as high as the Elbow is to be ſeen. See how the <hi>Daemons</hi> of <hi>Morpheus</hi> doe hover about her; all which are ſo many ſervants unto <hi>Mandrague,</hi> and inſpire her with a minde to goe unto the Fountain of Loves verity; which accordingly ſhee did, having dreamed that her Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard was dead; and therefore ſhee came to the Fountaine of Loves verity, to know the truth: She had no ſooner caſt her eye upon the water, but ſhe ſaw <hi>Damon;</hi> but, alaſs, ſhe ſaw by him the Shepheardeſs <hi>Melinde,</hi> a fair Shepheardeſs, and one who was never ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to love <hi>Damon:</hi> yet, though hee neither did love her, ſhee was by this Sorcery to appear: See how <hi>Fortune</hi> bewails the accident in the very ſame place, where <hi>Damon</hi> was almoſt dead. Behold how ſadly ſhe ſits againſt yonder Rock; her arms croſſed upon her breaſt: It ſeems as if ſhe ſighed, and her heart panted, her eyes looking up to heaven, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing revenge upon the Perſidie which ſhee beleeves <hi>Damon</hi> to bee guilty of; and becauſe her paſſion was extream, ſhe complained againſt him in a very loud tone: And <hi>Damon,</hi> who you ſee near her, though hee was at the laſt gaſp, yet hearing the lamentation of his Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſs, and knowing her voice, did call unto her. She hearing a faint hollow voice, went towards him. Oh heavens! how the ſight of him did amuſe her? and forgetting the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her comming thither, when ſhe ſaw him in that condition, ſhe asked who had uſed him ſo: It is, ſaid hee unto her, the change of my fortune: It is your Inconſtancy which hath deceived me with a ſhew of affection. To be brief, it is the happineſs of <hi>Maradon,</hi> whom I ſaw in the Fountain next you; and doe you thinke it poſſible I ſhould live and ſee you love another? <hi>Fortune</hi> hearing this, Oh <hi>Damon,</hi> ſaid ſhee, this Fountain is an errant Lyar; for it hath alſo ſhewed me <hi>Belinde</hi> next you, whom I ſee dying for the love of me. Thus theſe two Lovers found out the falſity of this Fountain, and being more aſſured than ever of each others affection, they dyed in each others Armes; <hi>Damon</hi> of his wound, and <hi>Fortune</hi> for griefe of his death. Behold there the Shepheardeſſe ſitting againſt a maſſie Rock, and <hi>Damon</hi> leaning his head in her lap, taking his laſt farewel, and bidding her, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieu. See how indulgent ſhe is about tying up his wound, and ſtooping to kiſſe him, whilſt her lap is full of blood. That old hagg which is next them, is <hi>Mandrague</hi> the Witch, who finding them both dead, curſed her Art, hated all her <hi>Daemons,</hi> tore her hair, and extreamly grieved at the death of theſe two faithful Lovers, and her own contentment. Look a little further off, and ſee how <hi>Cupid</hi> weeps, his Bow and Arrows broken, his Torch extinguiſhed, and his eyes ſwimming in teares for the loſſe of theſe two faithfull Lovers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Celadon</hi> was all this while very attentive unto the diſcourſe of the ſage <hi>Adamas,</hi> and often blamed himſelf for want of courage in not uſing the ſame remedy <hi>Damon</hi> did. And becauſe theſe conſiderations made him very mute, <hi>Galathea</hi> taking <hi>Celadon</hi> by the hand, and going out of the Grotte, ſhe ſaid thus unto him; What doe you think, <hi>Celadon,</hi> of the effects of Love? I doe think, ſaid he, that the effects of Love are ſimplicity and folly: And it is a popular errour, wherewith every one is apt to cover their ignorance or excuſe their faults, alwaies to attribute thoſe effects unto ſome Divinity, when they do not know
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:53526:96"/>
the cauſes. Why, ſaid the Nymph, doe you think, there is no Love? If there be, replyed the Shepheard, it muſt be nothing but ſweetneſs: But bee it what it will, Madam, you ſpeak of it unto one that is the moſt ignorant perſon that lives: For, beſides my qualities, which will not permit me to know much, my dull capacity, renders me incapable. Then the ſaid <hi>Silvia</hi> replyed unto him, <hi>Celadon</hi> (ſaid ſhe) I have ſeen you in a place where all in it have thought you not ſo ignorant in matters of Love. Fair Nymph, anſwered hee, in what place ſoever that was, there was much beauty in it, if you were there: but as too great a fire rather burns than warms, ſo your beauties are too high for our Ruſtique hearts; for they do rather make us admire than love, and adore rather than ſerve. With ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes as this, all this faire company went homeward, where Dinner waited for them.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as day did break, <hi>Leonida,</hi> according as it was reſolved upon over night by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damas,</hi> her companion, and <hi>Celadon;</hi> did come unto the Shepheards chamber, to dreſſe him in thoſe clothes which her Uncle had brought. But the little <hi>Merill,</hi> who by <hi>Galathea</hi>'s command did alwayes ſtay with <hi>Celadon,</hi> as well to be a ſpye over the actions of <hi>Leonida,</hi> as to wait upon the Shepheard, did a long while hinder their deſign. At laſt, ſome noiſe or other that was made in the Court, made <hi>Meril</hi> run out to ſee what the matter was. Then <hi>Celadon</hi> did riſe immediatly, and the Nymph (ſee what love will doe) did help to dreſſe him for without her hee knew not how to put his clothes on handſomly. Preſently after <hi>Meril</hi> returnes, yet <hi>Celadon</hi> hearing him, went into a Wardrobe, and hee was no ſooner entred but <hi>Meril</hi> asked where <hi>Celadon</hi> was? He is in the Wardrobe, ſaid the Nymph, and will come out preſently, what wouldſt thou have with him? I would tell him, ſayd the boy, that <hi>Amaſis</hi> is coming hither. <hi>Leonida</hi> was a little ſurpriſed, that ſhe could not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh what ſhe had begun; yet that ſhe might goe and give <hi>Celadon</hi> ſome counſel ſhe ſayd unto <hi>Meril,</hi> Go little <hi>Meril,</hi> run and acquaint thy Lady, leſt ſhe be ſurpriſed: The Boy ran as faſt as he could, and <hi>Celadon</hi> came out laughing at the news: Oh why do you laugh, ſaid the Nymph, her comming will hinder your going out? Come, come, ſaid hee, make haſte and dreſſe me; for amongſt ſo many Nymphs I ſhall the more eaſily ſteal away. But whilſt they were very buſie at their work, <hi>Galathea</hi> entred, and upon ſuch a ſudden, that <hi>Celadon</hi> could not get into the Cloſet. You may well imagine how both <hi>Leonida</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon</hi> were ſurpriſed at this accident: Yet the crafty <hi>Leonida</hi> ſeeing <hi>Galathea</hi> enter, ſhe held <hi>Celadon,</hi> and would not let him hide himſelf but turning towards <hi>Galathea,</hi> and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming much troubled Madam, ſaid ſhe, if you doe not uſe ſome means that my Lady come not hither, we are all undone; for my part I am doing what I can to diſguiſe <hi>Celadon</hi> in a womans habit, but I am afraid I ſhall not have time enough.
<hi>Galathea,</hi> who knew not at the firſt what to think of this <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> did much commend this witty invention of <hi>Leonida's,</hi> and when ſhe ſaw <hi>Celadon</hi> ſo well diſguiſed ſhe could not chuſe but laugh, and ſaid unto <hi>Leonida,</hi> Friend, but for you we had been all undone; for we could never have hidden <hi>Celadon</hi> amongſt ſo many Nymphs as will come with <hi>Amaſis;</hi> but now wee are well enough, and may ſafely ſhew him unto all your companions, who will take him for a woman. Thus <hi>Galathea,</hi> after it was agreed upon that <hi>Celadon</hi> ſhould ſay he was Coſen unto <hi>Adamas,</hi> and called <hi>Lucinde,</hi> went out to meet her Mother. I muſt ingenuouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe (ſaid <hi>Celadon,</hi> after ſhe was gone) I was never in my life ſo aſtoniſhed as at theſe three accidents. Firſt, at the coming of <hi>Amaſis.</hi> Secondly, at <hi>Galathea</hi>'s ſurpriſing us; and thirdly, at your ſudden invention. Shepheard, ſaid <hi>Leonide,</hi> what I do, proceeds from my deſires to rid you out of your pain; and I would to the gods you knew my heart, then would you find what happineſſe I wiſh you. By way of gratitude for ſo great an obligation, ſaid the Shepheard, I cannot chuſe but tender you my life, ſince you have preſerved it. Thus they talked till <hi>Meril</hi> came into the Chamber, and ſeeing <hi>Celadon</hi> almoſt dreſt, hee was raviſhed, and ſaid no live perſon could know him; for hee that was continually with him, had he not ſeen him dreſſing, ſhould have been miſtaken. Who told thee, ſaid <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that I was diſguiſed? My Lady, ſaid he, and commanded me to ſay your name was <hi>Lucinde,</hi> the Coſen of <hi>Adamas,</hi> and to acquaint the <hi>Druide</hi> with it, who could not chuſe but laugh when hee heard it, and promiſed to doe as my Lady commanded him. In the mean time, <hi>Amaſis</hi> was come out of her Coach, and met <hi>Galathea</hi> at the ſtairs foot, with <hi>Silvia</hi> and <hi>Adamas.</hi> Daughter, ſaid ſhe unto her, me-thinks you have been too long in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, and I am come to diſorder you a little. The good news I have received from <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daman</hi> and <hi>Lindamor,</hi>
does ſo rejoyce mee, that I cannot contain my joyes alone, and therefore I am come to make you a participant with me, and would have you goe with me
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53526:96"/>
unto <hi>Marcelles,</hi> where Bonefires ſhall be made through every ſtreet. I doe much rejoice at your happineſſe, Madam, ſaid <hi>Galathea</hi> and wiſh it may continue eternally: But truly, Madam, this place pleaſeth me ſo well, that I have no deſiring Genius to leave it. No more you ſhall long, replyed <hi>Amaſis,</hi> but becauſe I will not goe thither untill night, let us walke together, and I will acquaint you with the news I have received. Then <hi>Adamas</hi> made a low reverence, and ſaid, Certainly, Madam, your news is very good, ſince you are ſtirring ſo early to impart it unto your Daughter. I have received it (ſaid ſhee) two or three daies ſince, but found that I could not enjoy the contentment of it alone, and truly the news deſerves to be divulged. Thus they talked until they came into the Garden: when as they began to walk, <hi>Amaſis</hi> took <hi>Galathea</hi> on one ſide, and <hi>Adamas</hi> on the other, and then ſhe proceeded thus.</p>

               <p>Conſidering the ſtrange variety of accidents which are cauſed by Love, me-thinkes it muſt needs be confeſſed, that the Wheel of Love does turn about as faſt as the Wheel of Fortune, and that Paſſion cauſeth as many changes and alterations in humane affairs; as any thing elſe. The examples of theſe are ſo frequently before our eyes, that it is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to inſtance them: And yet when you have heard this which I intend to relate, you will confeſs you never heard of any more remarkable. It is known unto you, how <hi>Clida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> by hazard and Lot became a ſervant unto <hi>Silvia,</hi> and how <hi>Guyemant</hi> in bringing a Letter unto her from his Brother fell in love with her. And ſince that, I believe you are not ignorant of their deſign in departing both together to goe unto <hi>Merovea:</hi> Nor how I ſent a great number of the young Cavalrie under the conduct of <hi>Lindamor</hi> after them: But I beleeve, you do not know what they have done ſince they went. And therefore I do at this time intend to make a relation of their voyage unto you, for it is worthy of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. As ſoon as <hi>Clidaman</hi> came unto the Army, <hi>Guyemant</hi> who was known, brought him to kiſſe the hands of <hi>Merovea</hi> and <hi>Childerick,</hi> under the notion of a young Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, deſcended from a noble Family, who deſired to ſerve them. Hee was received with open Armes, eſpecially coming at a time when the enemy did menace them with a Battle. But when <hi>Lindamor</hi> came, and it was known who <hi>Clidaman</hi> was, he was honoured and carraſſed beyond all expreſſions; for he had already ſo ſignalized himſelf, that both friends and enemies did know and eſteem him. Amongſt other Priſoners which he and <hi>Guyemant</hi> took (for they alwayes went out together in any enterpriſe) there was one amongſt them that came out of <hi>Great Britane,</hi> ſo handſome, but ſo ſad, that he moved <hi>Clidaman</hi> to pitty him. And becauſe his impriſonment made him ſeem extreamly ſad, one day he ſent for him; and after he had asked him ſeveral queſtions of his Being and Quality, he asked him the cauſe of his ſadneſſe, telling him that if it did proceed from his impriſonment, hee ought like a man of courage to endure it, and thank the heavens that he fell into their hands, ſince he was in a place where he had all civil treatment, and that his want of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty proceeded onely from the command of <hi>Merovea,</hi> who had charged that no priſoners ſhould yet be ranſomed, yet hee would doe his beſt endeavour to procure him his liberty. The young man thanked him, but it was with a deep ſigh; which <hi>Clidaman</hi> more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at, did aske him the cauſe. Unto which he anſwered; Sir, this ſadneſſe which you ſee in my face, and thoſe ſighs which ſo often ſteal from my breaſt, doe not proceed from my impriſonment which you ſpeak of, but from another more ſtrict than it; for my ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome will ere long diſoblige me from this, but nothing leſſe than death can bring me out of the other. I ſhould alſo endure it with patience did I not foreſee my own death, and the ruin of the perſon who keeps me ſo cloſe in priſon. <hi>Clidaman</hi> did by his ſpeech ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that it was Love which troubled him, and by himſelfe conſidering the pain of his priſoner, his pitty moved him to promiſe him that he would procure his liberty as ſoon as poſſible, knowing by experience what paſſions and perplexities of mind uſeth to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany them that are deeply in love. Sir, ſaid hee unto him, ſince you know the power of Love, and that your noble Country makes mee beleeve, that what knowledge ſoever you have of mee, you will not alter your good will unto mee; therefore upon a promiſe not to diſcover mee, I will tell you a thing which will make you wonder. Then <hi>Clidaman</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing ſecreſie, he began thus.</p>

but Love, that is able to metamorphiſe women into men, hath made me aſſume this dreſſe; for I am not a man, but a woman, one that is deſcended from as good a Family as any is in <hi>Brittain,</hi> and my name is <hi>Melandre,</hi> who, conducted by ſtrange fortune, is fallen into your hands. There was a man whoſe name is <hi>Lydias,</hi> that fled out of his own Country, and came to <hi>London,</hi> having killed a man in Duell, and, to avoid the rigour of the Law, was forced to forſake his Country. Being in <hi>London,</hi> as it is the cuſtom of our Nation, he found ſo much civility and courteſy, that there was not a houſe of any noble note, where he was not familiar; and amongſt the reſt, he was as free to my Fathers houſe, as he could be unto his own. Now becauſe he intended to ſtay there, untill he could ſafely return into his own Country, he intended (the better to conform himſelfe unto the Britiſh humour, where every one has a particular Miſtreſſe) to ſeem as if he were in Love: And in this reſolution, (I cannot tell whether good or bad) he fixed his eyes upon me; and either out of affection or convenience, he began to profeſſe himſelfe my ſervant. I will not tire you with a long diſcourſe upon thoſe diſſimulations, thoſe courtſhips, and thoſe oathes; that he uſed unto me: But ſo it was, that after a long addreſſe of courtſhip, (for he ſtayed there two years) his handſomneſs, his courteſy, his diſcretion, and his valour, had ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon me, that I did love him without any diſſimulation. I ſhould bluſh to confeſs thus much, did I not think you a perſon that hath tryed the force of Love; or to tell you, that the beginning of my love was the end of my tranquillity. Things being thus, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that the <hi>Franks,</hi> after they had gotten the better in ſo many Battles againſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Emperours, againſt the <hi>Goths,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Gaules,</hi> they turned their Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Neuſtrians,</hi> and brought them unto ſuch termes, as they were foroed to ſend unto <hi>London,</hi> their antient Allie, to demand aid, who, according to the Alliance made between them, did grant them aid, by the conſent of the King and States. This newes was preſently divulged throughout all the Realm, and we, who were in the chiefe City, firſt heard of it. <hi>Lydias</hi> began to think upon his return the very firſt houre, aſſuring himſelfe, that his Countrymen, being in need of ſuch as he, would eaſily abſolve him from the death of <hi>Arontes:</hi> Yet, becauſe he ever promiſed me, that if he went, he would carry me with him, he concealed his deſigne from me, either as intending to deceive me, or elſe fearing I ſhould hinder his departure. Yet, as there can be no fire ſo cloſely covered, but there will be ſome ſmoak; ſo he could not ſo cloſely hide his hot deſire of departure, but I heard of it. Aſsoon as I came to the knowledge of it, the firſt time I ſaw him, I took him aſide: Well <hi>Lydias,</hi> ſaid I unto him, are you then reſolved I ſhall not know your inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of leaving me? Do you think my affection ſo feeble, that it is not able to follow the worſt of your fortune? If your affairs do urge you to return into your Country, why ſhould you not let me go with you? Ask my Fathers conſent unto our Marriage, I am confident he will be glad of our alliance; for I know he loves you. But, <hi>Lydias,</hi> do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure your ſelfe ſo much, as to leave me here deſolate behinde you; for if you do, the gods will puniſh you. Unto all this, he faintly anſwered, That he had no thought of returning, but that he valued his preſence with me above all affairs, and that I did him wrong to doubt of it; but his actions ſhould force me to confeſs it. Yet, for all theſe fair words, this perjur'd man went away within two or three daies after, with the firſt Forces that went out of great <hi>Brittain,</hi> and took his time ſo juſtly, that he came to the Sea-ſide juſt as they were Embarquing themſelves, and ſo he Embarqued with them. We were preſently adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed of his departure; yet, I was ſo perſwaded that he loved me, as I was the laſt that did believe it, ſo as he was gone eight daies before I could ever believe, that a man ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended as he was, could be ſuch a deluder and ungratefull man: but at laſt, many daies being paſt, and I never ſeeing nor hearing of him, I began to think my ſelfe deceived, and that he was really gone. You may well imagine I was much troubled at it, when falling ſick upon it, I was in ſuch a condition, as the Phyſicians not knowing my diſeaſe, gave me over for dead: But Love having a minde to ſhew himſelfe a better Doctor than <hi>Aeſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius,</hi> did cure me by a moſt ſtrange Antidote; and ſee how contrary his effects are unto our reſolutions. When I knew of the flight of <hi>Lydias,</hi> for ſo it may be called, I found my ſelfe ſo offended, that after a thouſand invocations of the gods, as witneſses of his perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, I ſwore, that I would never love him, as often as he ſwore that he would love me; ſo as it may be ſaid, both of us were perjured; for when my hatred was in the height of fury, a Ship coming in from <hi>Calice,</hi> to bring newes of the Armies happy landing, I heard, that <hi>Lydias</hi> paſſed over, with intention, to fight under the Banners of the Brittiſh Forces; but as ſoon as the Governour of that place, who was a Cozen unto <hi>Arontes,</hi> was advertiſed
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53526:97"/>
of it, he did impriſon him, as being already a perſon condemned, and that he was quite undone; for the Governour had very great credit amongſt the <hi>Neuſtrians.</hi> That indeed there was a way to ſave him, but it was ſo difficult, that none durſt attempt it; and it was this: As ſoon as <hi>Lydias</hi> was ſeized upon, he asked the Governour the reaſon, why a Cavalier of ſo great a reputation as he was, would not rather revenge his quarrells by the way of Arms, rather then by the way of Juſtice? For, it is not the cuſtome of the <hi>Gaules</hi> to have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe unto Juſtice, but unto Combat, in points of honour; and ſuch as do not ſo, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted cowards and diſhonourable. <hi>Lypandas,</hi> for ſo was the Governours name, did anſwer him, that were he not already condemned by Juſtice, he would try it with him by Arms; but it being a diſhonour to him, to fight with a man that was dead in the Law, if he had any friend that would undertake the Quarell for him, he would fight with him upon this ſcore, that if he were overcome, he would ſet him at liberty; and if not, then Juſtice ſhould have its courſe: And that his kindred or friends might have the more time to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, he would keep him a month in his power; if none came to preſent themſelves in that time, then he ſhould be delivered up to be puniſhed according to his merits. And that no advantage might be on either ſide, the Combat ſhould be with Sword and Dagger in their ſhirts. Now <hi>Lypandas,</hi> being reputed one of the valianteſt men of all <hi>Neuſtria,</hi> there was none ſo ſtout as to undertake this Combat: alſo the friends of <hi>Lydias</hi> not being advertiſed of it, they could not do him this good office. Oh Sir, what ſtrange apprehenſions had I, when I heard this newes? I muſt confeſſe, I was never in all my life ſo confuſed in my thoughts, no, not when this perfidious man left me. But though I knew, waves do beat in vain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a ſturdy Rock, yet, I muſt pay the tribute due unto Love, and arme my ſelfe in this quarrell, though it did coſt me both honour and life: And after I had long, but in vain, lamented the loſſe of the unfaithfull <hi>Lydias;</hi> at laſt, I muſt think upon his preſervation And in order to that, being tranſported with this new Fury, or rather, this old Love newly revived, I reſolved to go unto <hi>Calice,</hi> and adviſe with the kindred and friends of <hi>Lydias</hi> about it. Then taking order, as ſecretly as poſſibly I could, for my voyage, one night I ſtole away in this habit you now ſee me have; but ſo bad was my luck, that I tarried above a formight for a ſhip The heavens know what became of Parents when they heard of my departure, for I never heard of them ſince: great is my fear, that my Father's old age will never brook this croſſe; for he loved me as tenderly as himſelfe, ſo as I have ſince wondred a hundred times, I ſhould ever undertake this voyage: but, the truth is, it was Love, not me, that was the cauſe. But to return to our diſcourſe, after I had waited above fifteen daies for a paſſage, at the laſt I met with a ſhip which went for <hi>Calice,</hi> when there was not above five or ſix daies of <hi>Lydias</hi> his tearm to expire. I was ſo ſea-ſick, as I was forced to keep my bed two daies; ſo as there was but a very little time left, to conſult with the friends of <hi>Lydias,</hi> not knowing where to finde one of them, nor where they dwelt. Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how this did trouble me, ſo as I thought my ſelfe rather come to ſee him die, than any way to help him to live. Oh ye gods! how will ye diſpoſe of us? Tears did night and day flow from my eyes. At the laſt, the very day before the expiration of the tearm, being reſolved to die with <hi>Lydias,</hi> or before him, I reſolved to enter into Combat with <hi>Lypandas.</hi> What a reſolution, or rather deſpair, was this? I had never handled a ſword in my life, nor did well know in which hand I ſhould hold the ſword, and in which the dagger; yet was I fully reſolved to enter the Liſts againſt a Cavalier, whoſe profeſſion was fighting, and had gotten the title of Brave and Stout: But all theſe conſiderations were nothing unto me, who was reſolved to die before him, whom I loved above my life; and though I knew that I could not ſave him, yet was it ſome ſatisfaction to me, that I ſhould give ſome teſtimony of my affection. One thing did exceedingly trouble me, which I endeavoured to avoid, which was, that if I ſhould be known unto <hi>Lydias,</hi> this would hinder my deſigne, for we were to fight without Armour; which to remedy, I writ a note unto <hi>Lypandas,</hi> by way of challenge, and deſired him, that ſince we were both of us <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> it would be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, if we uſed ſuch Armes as Cavaliers do, and not to fight naked like deſperate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. To which he anſwered, That in the morning he would be in the field, and that I ſhould come Armed, as he would; yet, it ſhould be in his choice which way they ſhould fight. The next morning I preſented my ſelfe in the field, armed <hi>Cap a pe,</hi> but ſo loaded, that I could hardly ſtir; thoſe who ſaw me ſtagger, did think it either fear of fighting, or weakneſs, as indeed it was. Preſently I ſaw <hi>Lypandas</hi> come prancing, as if he would kill me with his looks; but I was not aſtoniſhed, untill <hi>Lydias</hi> was brought upon a Scaffold, to ſee the fight. I did ſo extreamly pitty him when I ſaw him in that condition, as I ſtood
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53526:98"/>
ſtock ſtill a great while, and could not ſtir: At laſt, the Judges carried me unto him, to know, whether he would accept of me for his Champion. He asked me who I was? Then counterfeiting my voice as well as I could, I ſaid unto him, Let it ſatisfie you, <hi>Lydias,</hi> that I am the onely One that will undertake this Combat for you. Since it is ſo, replyed he certainly you are a perſon of great valour, and therefore I do accept of you. So when I was going away, he ſaid unto me, Cavalier, be confident, that your quarrel is moſt juſt. Then I retired, with ſuch full reſolution for death, that I ſtayed for nothing but the ſound of the Trumpet, to ſummon us unto the Combat. Upon the firſt ſound, I ſet out but my Horſe did ſo jog me, that in lieu of carrying my Lance as I ſhould have done, I let it fall which way fortune would, and it fell ſo luckily upon my Horſes neck, that in lieu of hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Lypandas,</hi> it ran his Horſe into the body, who being wounded ran preſently away in ſpite of his Maſter and fell dead under him. <hi>Lypandas</hi> was ſo over-eager of doing bravely, that he miſſed his blow. As for me, my Horſe ran even whither he pleaſed; for I had enough to do in holding me by the Pommel, leſt I ſhould fall. And hearing <hi>Lypandas</hi> bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me turn again, and upbraiding me for killing his Horſe, I turned my horſe back, after I had got my ſword in my hand, as well as I could though with much ado: But my Horſe, aſsoon as he was turned having more courage then his Rider, began of himſelfe to gallop, and ran furiouſly upon <hi>Lypandas;</hi> and he ſtepping aſide, ran his ſword into my Horſes body as he paſſed by, and preſently I perceived him to ſhrink under me; and having loſt my ſtirrups, he fell under me, and ſo far off <hi>Lypandas,</hi> that I had time enough to get out of the Saddle, and recover my ſelfe from my Horſe: Then came <hi>Lypandas</hi> towards me, with his ſword up ready to ſtrike at me: and I muſt tell you that had not Love born up my Armes better then my ſelfe did, he had diſpatched me; but ſeeing him ſo furiouſly make his blow at my head, Nature had taught me to hold up my left arme, for otherwiſe, I had never remembred my buckler that was upon it; but his blow upon it was with ſuch fury, as it ſtruck it againſt my face, and made my eyes to ſparkle. When he ſaw me ſtagger, he offered another blow more heavie then the firſt; but ſuch was my fortune, that holding up my ſword, his and mine claſhed together: and both of them broke. <hi>Lypandas</hi> ſeeing both of us upon the ſame advantages, did ſay unto me, Theſe Armes are equally favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto us, I will try whether others will do the like, and therefore let us caſt off our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Armour, and fight in our ſhirts, for I will have the Combat ſo decided. Cavalier, ſaid I unto him, by what is paſt, you may ſee your ſelfe in the wrong; our quarrell is not mortall, therefore releaſe <hi>Lydias,</hi> and let the Combat alone. No, no, ſaid <hi>Lypandas</hi> in a rage, both <hi>Lydias</hi> and you ſhall die. Then I will try, ſaid I, whether I can retort that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon your own head. Then getting as far off <hi>Lydias</hi> as I could, for fear of being known, I put off my Armour, with the help of thoſe who brought us two other ſwords and daggers. And when my doublet was off, I took a ſword and a dagger, and went into the middle of the Liſts: I muſt tell you, that I had much ado to hide my breaſts; for my ſhirt, do what I could, did not ſo hide them, but the fulneſſe of my Papps were palpable to be ſeen; but that was the fartheſt off every ones imagination and as for <hi>Lydias,</hi> he could not know me; for being in mans habit, and the weight of my Armour having put me in o a very high colour, I was much altered. At laſt <hi>Lypandas</hi> and I were within ten or twelve paces one of another. Now did I look for nothing but death, being aſſured, he would run me through at the very firſt puſh: But the fortune of <hi>Lydias</hi> was ſo good, for it was his life I only feared, that this high-minded <hi>Lypandas</hi> running extream violently at me, he chanced to ſtumble, and his head fell at my feet, and at this fall he received two wounds, with his own weapons; the one with his dagger, that ran him through his right arme, and the other with his ſword, which cut him juſt over the eyes. As for me, I was ſo frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this fall, that I thought my ſelfe dead and him too; and therefore ſtepping back two or three paces, without doing him any hurt, I thought to vanquiſh him more by my courteſie then valour, and ſaid unto him: Riſe <hi>Lypandas.</hi> I will not hurt you when you are down. He being much ſtunnyed with his fall at firſt, did afterwards riſe, thinking to run upon me with all the ſtrength he had: but one of his wounds had blinded him, and the other took away the uſe of his arme, ſo as he could neither ſee nor hold his ſword: Which I perceiving, I took courage, and lifting up my ſword I ran unto him, ſaying: Yield thy ſelfe, <hi>Lypandas</hi> or elſe thou dyeſt. Why ſhould I yield my ſelfe, ſaid he, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of our Combat were not ſo; let it ſuffice, I ſet <hi>Lydias</hi> at liberty. Then the Judges comming in, and <hi>Lypandas</hi> having ratified his promiſe, they led me out of the Liſts in triumph: But fearing leſt I ſhould receive ſome wrong in a place, where <hi>Lypandas</hi> had all
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53526:98"/>
the power, after I had put my Armour on again, I went to <hi>Lydias,</hi> with my Helmet pulled down, and ſaid unto him: <hi>Lydias,</hi> render thanks unto the gods for my Victory; and if you deſire to have any diſcourſe with me, I will go unto the Town of <hi>Regiaque,</hi> where I will ſtay for you fifteen daies, for after that terme, I muſt go about ſome buſineſſe, which will carry me far from hence. You may enquire for the ſorrowfull <hi>Chavelier,</hi> for under that name and notion I paſſe. But I beſeech you, ſaid <hi>Lydias,</hi> ſhall I not now know unto whom I am ſo much obliged? No, ſaid I unto him, it will not be good neither for you nor me: And ſo I left him. Then providing my ſelfe another Horſe, I came to <hi>Regiaque,</hi> where I ſtayed. As ſoon as I was gone, this falſe <hi>Lypandas</hi> did impriſon <hi>Lydias</hi> more cloſe than before; and when he was charged with his promiſe unto me, he did evade it, by ſaying, That it is true, he promiſed me liberty, but he did not tel me when: and therefore it ſhould not be this twenty years, unleſſe upon a condition, that I ſhould become a Priſoner in his room, and ſo pay the ranſome of his liberty with the loſſe of my own. <hi>Lydias</hi> told him, that this was the height; both of ingratitude and perfidie. This did ſo offend him, that he ſwore, unleſs I came within fifteen daies, and put my ſelfe into his hands, he would transfer him over into the hands of Juſtice. And when <hi>Lydias</hi> inſtanced his perjury to him. I have long ſince, ſaid he, ſworn unto the <hi>Neuſtrian</hi> Lords, to maintain Juſtice, and I am more obliged to keep my firſt oth, than my ſecond. The firſt day paſſed on, &amp; I did not think much; but when I heard no newes of <hi>Lydias,</hi> I ſent a man to enquire of him: by him I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood what <hi>Lypandas</hi> had done and the term he had ſet: And though I did foreſee his cruelties, yet I reſolved to get <hi>Lydias</hi> out of his hands, nothing being ſo dear unto me, as his preſervation; and by fortune, the very ſame day you took me Priſoner, I was going unto him; and all the ſadneſſe you ſee in me, and thoſe deep ſighes you have obſerved to eſcape from me, did proceed, not from your impriſonment, (for that is ſweet unto me, compared with my expectations of the other) but they proceed from my fears, that this unworthy <hi>Lypandas</hi> will put <hi>Lydias</hi> into the hands of his enemies, who gape for his life; for of thoſe fifteen daies that were prefixed, ten of them are already paſt, ſo as I am out of all hopes to do this good office for my poor <hi>Lydias.</hi> Upon theſe words, her tears hindred her tongue, and ſhe was forced to be ſilent, with ſo many apparent ſignes of ſorrow, that <hi>Clidaman</hi> was moved unto compaſſion, and to comfort her, ſaid thus unto her: Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous <hi>Melandre,</hi> do not let your ſpirit droop for this, but rouſe up the generoſity of your ſoul: The gods, who have preſerved you in greater dangers, will not let you ſink under leſſe. You may aſsure your ſelfe, that I will uſe my utmoſt power to give you your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired contentment. But ſince I am under a Prince whom I would not diſpleaſe, I muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your liberty from him, and will promiſe you, to ſolicite him with all my power. So upon theſe fair promiſes, he went immediately to <hi>Childerick,</hi> and beſeeched him, he would be pleaſed to favour him ſo far, as to mediate unto the King his Father, for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of this young Priſoner. The young Prince, who loved my Son, and knew that his Father would be glad to oblige <hi>Clidaman,</hi> went preſently to <hi>Merovea,</hi> who granted his Sons requeſt. Then, becauſe the time was ſhort, he went immediately unto <hi>Melandre,</hi> and having drawn her aſide, ſaid thus unto her. Sorrowfull <hi>Cavalier,</hi> I hope now you will change that Epithite, ſince better fortune begins to ſhine upon you: The heavens begin now to ſmile upon you; and in teſtimony of what I ſay, know, that now you are at liberty, and may diſpoſe of your ſelfe as you pleaſe; the Prince of the <hi>Franks</hi> hath given me the diſpoſe of you, and the duty of a Cavalier obliges me, not only to give you your liberty, but to offer you all the aſſiſtance I am able. <hi>Melandre</hi> hearing this unhop't for language, did leap up for joy, and caſting her ſelfe at his feet, did kiſſe them by way of gratitude: and when ſhe ſaw that ſhe was to pay no ranſome, which ſhe could never have paid in the compaſſe of that fifteen daies: Noble Cavalier, (ſaid ſhe) you do make it appear, that you do know what it is to Love, ſince you are ſo pittifull unto ſuch as are poſſeſſed with it: I pray the heavens to make you as happy, as you are courteous and worthy of all good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Needs would ſhe have gone away that very night, but <hi>Clidaman</hi> would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her, becauſe it was dark; yet the next morning, as ſoon as day did appear, away ſhe went, and never ſtayed, untill ſhe came at <hi>Calice,</hi> where, by good fortune, ſhe arrived the very day before the expiration of the time. She had made her comming known unto <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pandas</hi> that very night, had ſhe not been jealous of his perfidie, whom ſhe was to deal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; and ſhe ſtayed untill the morning, to the end, there might be more witneſſes of the wrong he ſhould do her, in failing of his promiſe. The day being come, and paſt noon, when all the principall men of the Town, to honour the Governour, came unto his houſe,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53526:99"/>
in comes the ſorrowfull Cavalier, and preſents himſelfe unto him: At the firſt, he was not known, for none had ever ſeen him but in the Combat, where fear had altered his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and now every one drew neer to hear what he would ſay. <hi>Lypandas,</hi> ſaid he, I come here to ſummon you, to be as good as your promiſe, from the friends and kindred of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias;</hi> otherwiſe they tell you by mee, that they will publiſh you unto the world, for a falſe and perfidious promiſe-breaker. Stranger, anſwered <hi>Lypandas,</hi> go and tell them, that <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias</hi> is yet better then he ſhall be within theſe few daies; for before this day be don, I will transfer him over unto ſuch hands, as will revenge my quarrell. As for my promiſe, I think my ſelfe to be abſolved from it, by putting him into the hands of Juſtice. As for any new conditions I do inſiſt upon my firſt, which is, that he with whom I fought, do put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into my hands, to the end, I may have my will of him, and releaſe <hi>Lydias.</hi> What will you doe with him, ſaid he, when you have him? When I once have him, anſwered he, and when I am to render you an account of my actions, then you ſhall know. Since it is ſo, ſaid the ſad Cavalier, ſend for <hi>Lydias,</hi> and him whom you deſire ſhall put himſelfe into your hands. <hi>Lypandas,</hi> who did extreamly deſire to be revenged upon his enemy, ſent for <hi>Lydias: Lydias,</hi> who knew this to bee the laſt day for his terme, did thinke this ſending for, had been to transferre him over into the hands of the Law: But though hee did foreſee a certaine death, yet hee did rather deſire it, than to ſee him who had fought in his cauſe, in any danger. When hee came before <hi>Lypandas,</hi> he ſaid thus unto him; <hi>Lydias,</hi> this is the laſt day that is prefixed you to bring your Champion into my hands: The young Cavalier is come hither to that end, which if he do then you are at liberty. <hi>Melander</hi> all this while did ſo turn her face from <hi>Lydias,</hi> that he could not know her and ſo ſaid thus; Yes <hi>Lypandas</hi> I have promiſed, and I will perform: I would you would be as punctual in all your promiſes: But 'tis no matter, I am he whom you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and who values not any cruelty or rigour you can uſe againſt me, ſo my friend here may be out of his pain. Then every one fixed their eyes upon her, and remembring the actions ſhe uſed when ſhe fought, they knew her to be the ſame. Her beauty her youth, and her affection moved every heart unto pitty, but <hi>Lypandas,</hi> who being extreamly incenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her commanded her preſently to priſon, and to let <hi>Lydias</hi> go. <hi>Lydias</hi> ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo infinitely obliged, would not ſuffer it, but <hi>Melander</hi> came to him, and ſaid in his ear, Go <hi>Lydias;</hi> as for me, I know how to get out eaſily when I will; Go and ſerve <hi>Mero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vea,</hi> and particularly <hi>Clidaman,</hi> who is the procurer of your liberty; and tell him you came from me. 'Tis impoſſible I ſhould goe, ſaid <hi>Lydias,</hi> before I know who you are. I am the ſorrowfull Cavalier, ſaid ſhee, and that's enough, and you need know no more.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Lydias</hi> went with an intention to ſerve the King of the <hi>Frankes,</hi> ſince hee who twice ſaved his life would have it ſo: But in the mean time <hi>Lypandas</hi> did expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that <hi>Melander</hi> ſhould be well guarded, and ſhackles put upon her hands and feet, not caring if ſhee had dyed with the miſery. Judge in what a ſad condition this young woman was; her victuals were bad, her lodging miſerable, and all accomdations want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: So as if her affection had not been ſome comfort unto her, it was impoſſible ſhee ſhould have lived ſo long in that miſery. In the mean time it was divulged throughout all <hi>Neuſtria,</hi> that <hi>Lydias</hi> by the procurement of a friend was releaſed from his impriſonment at <hi>Callice,</hi> and was gone to ſerve the King <hi>Merovea,</hi> and thereupon was declared a Traitor of his Country. Yet he failed not to go unto <hi>Merovea's</hi> Camp, where he found out which was <hi>Clidamans</hi> Tent. As ſoon as <hi>Lindamor</hi> and <hi>Guyemant</hi> ſaw him, they ran to him, and embraced him with abundance of love and courteſie, at which hee was extreamly aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; for they took him for <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> who a little before was loſt in the battle which they had with the <hi>Neuſtrians,</hi> and was ſo extreamly like him, that any one would have taken the one for the other. At the laſt, being known to be <hi>Lydias, Melanders</hi> friend, he was recommended unto <hi>Merovea,</hi> before whom <hi>Lydias</hi> related the whole ſtory of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, and the courteſie which he had received from an unknown Cavalier: Alſo how he came by this unknown Cavaliers command to ſerve him, eſpecially <hi>Clidaman.</hi> After the King had received him, and given him thanks for his good wil unto him; <hi>Clida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſpoke to him, and ſaid, Is it poſſible, <hi>Lydias,</hi> you ſhould not know him that has fought for you and is now in priſon to releaſe you? No certainly, ſaid hee, I doe not know him. This is the ſtrangeſt thing I ever heard of, ſaid <hi>Clidaman,</hi> did you never ſee any that did reſemble him? Not that I remember, ſaid <hi>Lydias,</hi> and wondered. Then ſaid <hi>Clidaman,</hi> I ſhall relate unto the King a ſtory, the moſt worthy of compaſſion that Love ever cauſed:
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53526:99"/>
Then he related how <hi>Lydias</hi> went into <hi>Great Brittaine,</hi> the courteſies he received there, the affection of <hi>Melandre</hi> to him the promiſes hee made to carry her into <hi>Neuſtria</hi> with him when he went away, his flight, and his impriſonment at <hi>Callais.</hi> Poor <hi>Lydias</hi> was ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed to hear ſo many particulars of his life, that he knew not what to thinke: But when <hi>Clidaman</hi> related <hi>Melandres</hi> reſolution to aſſume mans habit, and to ſight a Duel with <hi>Lypandas,</hi> and all that I have formerly related, every one was raviſhed. Oh heavens! ſaid <hi>Lydias,</hi> is it poſſible I ſhould be ſo blind? What ſhould I doe to anſwer this obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? You can doe no leſſe, ſaid <hi>Clidaman,</hi> than give that life to her which ſhee has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd. That is little, anſwer'd he, unleſſe accompanyed with affection. Whilſt they were thus in diſcourſe, every hearer concluded, this noble act of this Womans, deſerved, that this great Army ſhould goe and aſſault <hi>Callais</hi> for her ſake. I proteſt, ſaid <hi>Merovea</hi> our Army cannot be better employed than in the reſcue of ſo virtuous a Lady. Night being come, <hi>Lydias</hi> told <hi>Clidaman,</hi> that whilſt he was at <hi>Callais</hi> a priſoner, he diſcovered a weak place in the Walls of the Town, where had he but a few men, he could infallibly enter. This being reported unto <hi>Merovea,</hi> it was approved of. So <hi>Lydias</hi> had given him five hundred Archers, and three hundred Men at Armes for the execution of this enterpriſe. In conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (for I will not relate all particulars) <hi>Callais</hi> was taken, <hi>Lypandas</hi> impriſoned, and <hi>Melandre</hi> releaſed out of her captivity. But, I know not how it came to paſſe, nor why, yet as ſoon as all was quiet, after the Town was taken, <hi>Lydias</hi> and <hi>Melandre</hi> went away, and it was never ſince known what became of them. In the mean time, poor <hi>Ligdamon</hi> hath been moſt miſerably tormented for <hi>Lydias;</hi> for, being taken priſoner by the <hi>Neuſtrians,</hi> he was miſtaken for <hi>Lydias,</hi> and condemned to death. <hi>Clidaman</hi> procured <hi>Merovea</hi> to ſend two Heralds at Armes, purpoſely to let them know that they were miſtaken, but they would not beleeve it. Thus was <hi>Ligdamon</hi> put into a den of Lyons, where they ſay hee did things beyond Man: but doubtleſſe he had dyed amongſt them, had not a fair Lady demanded him for her Husband, which cuſtome did at that time ſave him, but hee dyed preſently after; for hee loving <hi>Silvia,</hi> would not marry that Lady, but choſe death rather than her for, juſt upon the very Marriage, he poyſoned himſelfe; and ſhee alſo, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> to be <hi>Lydias,</hi> did poyſon her ſelfe in the ſame Cup. Thus poor <hi>Ligdamon</hi> dyed, ſo lamented by every one, that his very enemies did pitty him: But Love had a moſt notable way of Revenge upon <hi>Lypandas;</hi> for when hee knew <hi>Melandre</hi> to be a woman, and remembring her virtue, beauty, and affection, hee fell ſo deſperately in love with her, that the poorman had no other conſolation but to talk of her. My Sonne ſent me word, that he endeavoured to get his releaſe and hoped to obtain it.</p>
               <p>Thus ſee, ſaid <hi>Amaſis,</hi> how they live in the plenitude of Honour, and none in all the Army more eſteemed than they. I pray heavens to continue their good fortune, ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damas:</hi> And whilſt they were thus talking they ſaw <hi>Leonida, Lucinde,</hi> and the little <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril</hi> coming towards them; I ſay <hi>Lucinde,</hi> for ſo it was agreed <hi>Celadon</hi> ſhould be called. <hi>Amaſis,</hi> who knew her not asked who ſhe was? It is one that is Coſen unto <hi>Adamas</hi> (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Galathea)</hi> her name is <hi>Lucinde,</hi> one that is ſo fair, and every way ſo virtuous, as I deſired her to ſtay with me ſome certaine dayes. She ſeems, ſaid <hi>Amaſis,</hi> as good as fair. I doe beleeve, Madam, ſaid <hi>Galathea</hi> that her diſpoſition would be very pleaſing unto you, and if you think good ſhe ſhall goe with us unto <hi>Marcelles.</hi> By this time <hi>Leonida</hi> was come ſo near that <hi>Lycinde</hi> bowed her ſelf, and kiſſed the hand of <hi>Amaſis</hi> with ſo good a grace, as any one living would have taken her for a woman: <hi>Amaſis</hi> did her the honour to kiſſe her, and ſaid that any who had a relation to <hi>Adamas</hi> were as dear unto her as her own children. Then <hi>Adamas</hi> began to ſpeak leſt if the diſguiſed <hi>Lucinde</hi> ſhould have anſwered, her voice might betray her; but hee needed not to feare that; for ſhee knew ſo well how to feigne her voice, as it did rather help to deceive them. However at this time ſhe ſuffered <hi>Adamas</hi> to anſwer, and after a low reverence ſhee went amongſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nymphs, watching her opportunity how to ſteal away. At the laſt, Dinner time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at hand, <hi>Amaſis</hi> went into the houſe, where finding meat upon the Table, every one dined with a merry heart, except the fair <hi>Silvia,</hi> who did moſt ſadly reſent the death of her dear <hi>Ligdamon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Dinner was done, ſome of the Nymphs had a minde to play; others to view the houſe; ſome to walk in the Gardens, and others to fit and diſcourſe in the Chamber of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſis: Leonida</hi> ſeeming as if ſhe would make her ſelf ready for her going with <hi>Amaſis,</hi> went out of the Chamber, and preſently after <hi>Lucinde</hi> followed; and then ſeeming as if they would walk, they went out of the Caſtle, having moſt of the Shepheards clothes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53526:100"/>
their Petticoats, and when they were got into the thick of the Wood, the Shepheard undreſſed himſelf, and putting on his own cloathes, he thanked the Nymph for her good aſſiſtance, offering her in exchange, his life &amp; all that did depend upon it. Then the Nymph with a deep ſigh ſaid unto him, Well, <hi>Celadon,</hi> have I not performed my promiſe? I pray remember yours alſo. I ſhould think my ſelfe, ſayd <hi>Celadon,</hi> the moſt unworthy man that lives, if I did not perform all my promiſes unto you. Then, <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſaid ſhe, remember what you ſwore unto me; for I am reſolved to put you to the Teſt this very hour: Fair Nymph, anſwered <hi>Celadon,</hi> diſpoſe of me as far as I am able, as freely as you can of your ſelf; for I am fully reſolved upon obedience. Have you not made a promiſe unto me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the Nymph, that I ſhould ſearch into all your life paſt, and if I found any thing which you could doe for me, you would doe it? And he anſwering that it was true, then <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſaid ſhe, I have done as you did bid me, and though they ſay Love be blind yet I have ſo much light left in me, as to know that you ought to continue that love which you have ſo often promiſed unto your <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> for diſguſts of love will not allow any one to be perjured or unfaithfull, and therefore ye ought not to fail in your duty, though they have treated you ill. The faults of others can never excuſe or waſh away our own. Love therefore the fair and happy <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> with as much ſincerity of affection as ever you did: ſerve her, adore her, and more if it bee poſſible; for Love requires extreames in his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. But yet, I know, that the good offices which I have done you, does deſerve ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And becauſe Love can never be payd but with Love, you are obliged to pay mee in the ſame coyn, if no impoſſibilities doe intervene. But ſince one heart is not capable of any more but one love, let me be paid with what it can: And ſince you cannot love me as your Miſtris, I would have you love me as your Siſter; and ever hereafter to love mee, cheeriſh me, and treat me in that manner. <hi>Celadons</hi> contentment cannot be expreſſed, after hee heard this language; for he confeſſed it was infinitely his own deſire: And therefore, after he had given the Nymph a Million of thanks for her affection, hee vowed to receive her as his Siſter, and under that notion to doe whatſoever ſhee commanded him. And ſo they parted extreamly well contented and ſatisfied one with another. <hi>Leonida</hi> returned to the Caſtle, &amp; the Shepheard to his voyage, ſhunning all ſuch Plains where he thought he might meet with any Shepheards of his acquaintance. And leaving Mount <hi>Verdun</hi> on the left hand, he went unto a little riſing ground, from whence he could view moſt of thoſe places where hee was accuſtomed to feed his Flock, where <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was wont to come unto him, and where they uſed to ſhade themſelves from the ſcorching Sunne in the heat of the day. Briefly, this Proſpect preſented to his eye, all thoſe contentments which hee had been ſo long deprived of: And in contemplation of them hee ſate down under a ſhady tree, and ſighed out theſe Verſes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Celadon</hi> having no mind to be ſeen by any that could know him, when hee ſpied this Shepheard a good diſtance off, he concealed himſelf behinde a thick buſh, and when hee was paſt, he followed him at an unſeen diſtance, untill he ſaw him ſit down, and then hee crept ſo neare that hee could heare all his ſad complaints. The humour of this unknowne Shepheard ſympathizing with his own, it ſwelled him with a curioſity to know ſomthing from him both concerning his own Miſtris, and his alſo. Therefore going to him, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſpeak thus, Sad Shepheard, I doe wiſh thee joy with all my heart, ſince I can doe no more, I hope thou wilt take my wiſh in good part; and in requital of my love, I pray thee tell me whether thou doeſt know <hi>Aſtrea, Phillis,</hi> and <hi>Lycidas;</hi> and if thou doſt, then tell me all thou knoweſt of them. Kinde Shepheard, anſwered hee, thy civil language obliges me to pray, that thou mayſt never have any ſuch occaſion of ſorrows as I have: And I will freely tell thee all I doe know concerning thoſe perſons you mention, although my own grief forbids me to meddle in any other buſineſſe but my own. It is about a month or ſix weeks, ſince I came into this Country of <hi>Forreſts,</hi> not as many doe, to try what the Fountain of Loves verity will ſhew me; for I am but too certain of my ſad fate; but by the commandment of the gods, who from the fertile banks of the famous <hi>Siene,</hi> ſent mee hither with aſſurance that I ſhould here finde a remedy againſt my miſeries: And ever ſince I came, I have taken up my lodging in ſuch Villages as ſeemed moſt agreeable to my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and humour, with a reſolution to ſtay as long as the heavens ſhall permit me. This deſign hath moved me to enquire of all the Shepheards and Shepheardeſſes of theſe parts: I am able to ſatisfie you in any thing you deſire to know of them. All I deſire to know, ſaid <hi>Celadon,</hi> is to be ſatisfied how they doe. All of them, ſaid he, are well; but they are all troubled very much at one act of blind and fickle Fortune; and that is, at the loſſe of one <hi>Celadon</hi> (a Shepheard altogether unknown to me) who was the Brother of <hi>Lycidas:</hi> This loſt Shepheard was ſo loved and eſteemed of every one, that he is generally lamented by all, eſpecially by thoſe three perſons whom you named unto me. It was conceived that this Shepheard was a devoted ſervant unto <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and it was the enmity of their Parents which hindered them from Marriage. How is it reported, ſaid <hi>Celadon,</hi> this Shepheard was loſt? It is variouſly reported, anſwered he; Some ſpeake as opinion leads them, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers according to circumſtances and appearance; and ſome, as others doe report: So as it is divers wayes related. As for me, I came hither into theſe quarters the very ſame day he was loſt; and I doe remember that every one was ſo affrighted at the accident, as none knew how to make a perfect relation of it. In concluſion (and that is the beſt received o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion becauſe <hi>Phillis, Aſtrea,</hi> and <hi>Lycidas</hi> themſelves doe ſay it) that this Shepheard ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping cloſe by the River ſide, he fel in, and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> alſo, but her clothes did ſave her. <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> imagining that they had prudently invented this report, to take away occaſion of talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill upon the accident, he was very glad; for his feares alwayes were, that reports would reflect much upon <hi>Aſtrea</hi>'s honour, and therefore hee asked him further; But what doe they think, ſaid he, is become of this Shepheard? That hee is dead (anſwered the ſad Shepheard) And I aſſure you, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> takes it ſo ſadly, that though ſhee puts the beſt face of it ſhe can, yet every one ſaies, it is almoſt incredible, that ſhee ſhould be ſo much changed; however, for ought I ſee, ſhe is ſo fair that (except <hi>Diana</hi> hinders her) I never ſaw any fairer, except my deareſt <hi>Cleon,</hi> and indeed they three may well be compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Every one, ſaid <hi>Celadon,</hi> will ſpeake well of his own Miſtris; and Love has a quality, not onely to blind, but to change the eyes of Lovers; ſo as there was never any Lover that thought his Miſtris ugly. This, anſwered the Shepheard, were ſomething, if I were in love with <hi>Aſtrea</hi> or <hi>Diana;</hi> but ſince I am ever incapable of that, I may be a
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53526:101"/>
competent judge: And you who ſeem to doubt of this Shepheardeſſes beauty, you muſt needs be either a ſtranger, or elſe ſome ill-willer. I am neither of thoſe two, ſaid <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> but truly I am the moſt miſerably afflicted Shepheard that is in the whole world. I ſhall never grant that, ſaid <hi>Tircis,</hi> unleſſe you except me: For if your miſery proceed from any thing elſe but Love, the pain cannot be ſo great as mine, ſince the heart is the moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part we have, and is moſt ſenſible of any ſorrows: And though your miſery doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from love, yet it muſt needs ſubmit unto mine; for of all the miſeries in love, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair is the moſt intolerable; diſdain, anger, hatred, jealouſie, abſence, or any thing is ſhort of death; for this pale Goddeſſe with her fatall hand, does cut away both hope and life; ſo as I the moſt miſerable amongſt all men living, doe complain of a miſery without any remedy or hope. <hi>Celadon</hi> anſwered with a deep ſigh, Oh Shepheard, how much doe you erre in your opinion? I doe confeſs that the greateſt miſeries are thoſe which doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Love, of which I have had a full experience: But I cannot by any means allow that thoſe miſeries which are without hope are the moſt ſad; nor indeed doe they deſerve to bee reſented; for it is a meer act of folly to weep for a thing which cannot bee help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And Love, anſwered hee, what is that but a meer folly? I will not enter upon that, ſaid <hi>Celadon,</hi> before we have done with the other; for that alone will take up much time. But I pray tell me, Doe you lament this death out of love, or not? Certainly out of love, anſwered he. If it be out of love, anſwered <hi>Celadon,</hi> then I have heard <hi>Silvander,</hi> and all our learned Shepheards ſay, that Love is nothing but a deſire to enjoy that beauty which you find in the perſon loved. 'Tis very true, ſaid the ſtranger: Then, replyed <hi>Celadon,</hi> Will any reaſonable man deſire a thing which cannot bee had? No certainly, ſaid <hi>Tircis.</hi> Then, ſaid <hi>Celadon,</hi> the death of <hi>Cleon</hi> ought to be the cure of all your grief; for ſince you confeſſe that deſire never ought to be where there is no hope of obtaining; and that Love is nothing elſe but a deſire; Death, which puts you out of all hopes to enjoy, ought by conſequence to put you out of all deſire; and deſire being dead, all Love ſhould die with it. The ſad Shepheard anſwered, that whatſoever he ſaid, he was ſure that his miſery was moſt extream; and becauſe he would not revive the memory of his dead <hi>Cleon,</hi> hee would not argue the matter any longer, onely thus farre hee ſaid, Shepheard, that which comes under ſence is more certain than that which is onely in opinion: And therefore all thoſe reaſons which he alleged could not convince him of that which he was ſo ſenſible of: So recommending him unto the tuition of <hi>Pan, Celadon</hi> and he parted: And Solitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt ſuitable to a Lovers thoughts, <hi>Celadon</hi> went on through the Woods untill hee came to the Bridge of <hi>Boutreſſe:</hi> and paſſing over the River there, he was in doubt which way to wend; but this was his full reſolution, to obey <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> who had forbidden him to ſee her, untill ſhe did command him. At laſt, being come near <hi>Bonleiu,</hi> the habitation of the chaſt Veſtals, hee was aſhamed that he had ſo raſhly approached that place; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore intending to goe farther off, hee went into a Wood, ſo thick and boggy, that hee had much adoe to get out again. This forced him to draw nearer the River; for the thinne gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel was leſſe troubleſome to him than the thick mud: So walking along, untill hee was weary, hee looked for a convenient place to reſt upon, intending to keep ſo cloſe untill night that none ſhould ſee him: At the laſt, hee caſt his eye upon a little Cave, whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance on one ſide towards the River the water had waſhed; and the other ſide was ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Trees and Buſhes, as thoſe in the way could not ſee it; nor had he himſelfe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of it, had hee not gone along the River ſide. The place did ſo pleaſe him, that he reſolved to paſſe away the reſt of the day in it, and not to come out of this <hi>Grotto</hi> untill night: And therefore hee beganne to trim it up as well as he could, removing the Rubbiſh which the River had brought into it. The place was nothing elſe but a Rock, which the water beating upon, had by degrees worn away, and made a Cave, and that in ſuch vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Rooms, as if it were done on purpoſe; ſo as ſtooping a little, hee entred into a room like a Bed-chamber: the place was about ſix or ſeven paces in length, and as much broad: It was about the height of a man, though in ſome places, the points of the Rock were troubleſome, which the Shepheard did by degrees break off with a Flint: Hec contrived himſelf a place like a bed, which he covered with Moſſe; and having fitted all things in this manner, he laid his coat, and ſuch things as troubled him, upon his bed, and then looking upon the ground, he found a Letter, which he knew to be from the fair <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> which hee did let fall. Hee rouzed up himſelfe, as out of a deep ſleep, and came into the entrance of the Cave, where looking upon the dear paper which he held in his hands, after a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred zealous and amorous kiſſes, hee ſaid; Oh thou moſt deare paper, heretofore my great
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53526:102"/>
joy, and now the occaſion of my moſt bitter ſorrowes: Upon this, opening it, the firſt thing that preſented it ſelfe to his eye, was <hi>Aſtrea's</hi> Character joyned with his: This did ſo freſhly revive the memory of his former happineſſe, as now he was reduced almoſt unto tearms of deſpair. Oh ye Characters, (ſaid he) too true teſtimonies of my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, why are you not ſeparated from mine, to wait upon the will of my fair Shephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs? Time was, when you might have done me good ſervice; but now, that ſuch fatall dyſaſters have ſeparated us, why are you here? Perhaps it is to make it appear, that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſhowre all their dyſaſterous influences upon me, but can never make my will diſtinct from <hi>Aſtrea's.</hi> Upon this, he ſat down upon a great ſtone, which he had rouled out of the River, to the entrance into the <hi>Grotto;</hi> and then, after he had wiped away all the tears from his eyes, he read theſe enſuing words.</p>

               <p>Theſe few words of <hi>Aſtrea's,</hi> cauſed abundance of miſery unto <hi>Celadon;</hi> for after he had many times read them over, they did make his wounds to bleed afreſh; for, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected into his memory one after one, all the favours that ever this Shepheardeſſe did him, which moved him unto ſo much regreet, as had not night approached, he had not ſuffered his eyes to ceaſe from crying, or his tongue from complaining, againſt what his heart ſuffered; but darkneſſe cauſed him to enter into his Cave, and being very weary with walking and grieving, he fell aſleep. Two daies were paſt, before this ſad Shepheard ever thought of eating; for he was ſo taken up with ſad thoughts, and his mind was ſo full of melancholly, as he never thought upon any meat, but was ſo diſtempered with tears, that his eyes ſeemed two Fountains: and had he not feared offending the gods, in cauſing his own death, and wore, in thereby loſing the Idea of his fair <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> doubtleſſe he had ended the courſe of his life; but ſeeing he was conſtrained unto it, he did viſit that bag of victualls which <hi>Leonida</hi> had furniſhed him withall, which proviſion laſted him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny daies; for he did eat as little as poſſible he could: At laſt, he was conſtrained to have recourſe unto roots and fallads. All the day long, if he ſaw none neer his ſolitary habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he would walk upon the gravelly ſhore, and often engraved the cauſe of his ſorrowes upon the bark of Trees; ſometimes he would engrave <hi>Aſtrea's</hi> Characters and his own; then upon a ſudden would he deface them, ſaying, Thou art deceived, <hi>Celadon,</hi> this is not a time for Characters: for thou art ſtill conſtant, and, to thy grief all things elſe are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Let all thoſe teſtimonies of paſt happineſs alone; and if thou wilt needs be writing in Characters, engrave with them thy tears, thy ſorrowes and thy death, as moſt ſuitable unto thy condition. When night came, then his ſad thoughts came freſher into his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory for darkneſs being more ſit for it, his imagination was the ſtronger; nor did he ever retire, unleſs it was night and if the Moon ſhined, he would walk all night long, and ſometimes ſinde himſelfe aſleep under a tree in the morning. Thus this ſad Shepheard, leading this diſconſolate life, he was grown ſo pale and lean, that he was not knowable; and ſometimes when he went unto a Fountain to drink, he would wonder to ſee himſelfe in the water; his hair was grown all into diſorder, his eyes ſhrunk, his noſe ſharp and long, ſo as it was a wonder he ſhould live. Oh! had <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſeen him in this ſad condition, what abundance of content would it have been unto her, to ſee by undeniable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that ſhe was perfectly loved by the moſt faithfull and compleat Shepheard of all <hi>Lignon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Moon had been twice at the full, ſince <hi>Celadon</hi> eſcaped out of <hi>Galathea's</hi> hands; and ſtill, in obedience to the commands of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> he durſt not preſent himſelfe unto her, but ſenlked himſelfe in his <hi>Grotto:</hi> And though three months were compleatly paſt ſince his loſſe, yet, the reſentments of it were ſo freſh in the ſoul of his Shepheardeſſe, that all her prudent circumſpection was not able to conceal it, from ſuch as had any obſervance over her. It ſeems, heaven, as a puniſhment upon her, denyed her that remedy, which Time uſually affords unto thoſe that are ſubject unto ſorrow; for, in lieu of allaying the bitterneſſe of it, ſhe did daily diſcover new occaſions, and matter for her griefe, and when any reſentments did divert her memory of them, her eyes would then ſix themſelves upon
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53526:102"/>
no objects, but ſuch as were ſad; which to avoid, ſhe kept her ſelfe moſt commonly in her Cabin: But, her greateſt affliction was, ſhe was deprived of that conſolation, which is found, even in the greateſt misfortunes; I mean, ſhe could not lay the fault upon any but her ſelf, nor could ſhe find out any excuſe to turn it another way: And certainly, it had bin abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſſible for her to have lived under ſuch a load of griefs, if the ſociety of <hi>Diana</hi> &amp; <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> had not helped her to bear the burthen; for the preſence of reall friends, is doubtleſſe one of the moſt ſoveraigne remedies that griefe can receive; and theſe two reall friends not being ignorant of it, they had ſo great a care of her, that one or both of them were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually with her; they would pull her out of her Chamber by force, and carry her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the moſt unfrequented places, for unto others they would not, leſt they ſhould meet with ſome accidents, which might bring <hi>Celadon</hi> afreſh into her memory; ſo as theſe kinde Shepheardeſſes did ſweeten many an houre, and ſtole many a bitter minute from <hi>Aſtrea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Silvander</hi> on the other ſide, under pretence of a faigned addreſſe unto <hi>Diana,</hi> did fall ſo extreamly in reall love with her, as he hath been an excellent example unto all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and, at his own expences taught them this Doctrine, that Love will not be jeaſted withall. He findes now ſo many compulſive cauſes of love in that Shepheardeſſe, as he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires he ſhould be acquainted with her ſo long, and love her no ſooner: And though this task of courtſhip which he had undertaken, was the Origen of his diſeaſe; yet, he made no complaint, becauſe <hi>Diana,</hi> without any offence, allowed him liberty to expreſſe his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for ſuch was the violence of his love, that if it had not been allowed ſome vent, it would have broke him, and he could not poſſibly have lived without it. When he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with himſelfe, he plainly ſaw, that he had made a diſadvantageous change, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when he remembered how happy he was, an abſolute Maſter of himſelfe; oft did he muſter up all his arguments drawn from reaſon, to rid himſelfe from this new ſervitude; and when he found that reaſon was too weak to do it, he would arme himſelfe with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent reſolutions againſt it. But alas! look how oft he tryed all theſe waies ſo oft did he ſee, that it is in vain for any man to ſtrive aganſt the ordinances of heaven; and that whoſo is wiſe, will rather comply and ſubmit his will thereunto. And therefore every morning and night, when civility denyed him <hi>Diana's</hi> company, he uſed to retire himſelfe from all manner of company, as well, becauſe all the world without her was irkſome unto him, as to conſult more freely with himſelfe, and to conſider, which way he had beſt take, to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his deſires: And though he ſaw many impoſſibilities in the purſuit of his affection yet, for all that, he could fix upon no reſolutions, which concluded not in advantage of his love: If at any time he ſtarted a deſigne to make a retreat, Oh, how ſuddenly would his heart give a check unto himſelfe? If he determined to purſue, Oh, what difficulties, what rubs, and how many Martyrdoms did he foreſee? What ſhall we do, <hi>Silvander,</hi> (would he ſay to himſelfe) ſince both purſuit and retreat are equally impoſſible? Then would he ſay in anſwer to himſelfe: Thy beſt way is to do, as the heavens they would have thee. Can it be imagined, that the heavens would ever have made her ſo admirably fair, but only, that all thoſe who ſee her, ſhould love her? And ſince in going both forward and backward, thou findeſt equall impoſſibility, chuſe that courſe which is moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the will of heaven and to thy ſelfe. She is made ſo fair, purpoſely to be loved and adored; and for my part, I will far ſooner quit my life, then her ſervice. What then needs any further conſultation, ſince the will of heaven and my own, do ſo well agree upon it?</p>
               <p>As he was in diſcourſe with himſelfe, he chanced to be neer the pleaſant River of <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> oppoſite to a Rock, which reſounded an Eccho, that diſtinctly anſwered to the laſt ſyllable of every ſentence: And therefore, after much turbulency of ſpirit, he rouſed up himſelfe, as if awakned out of a dream, and ſaid, Why ſhould I thus turmoile my ſelfe in ſo many ravelled contrarieties? The <hi>Eccho</hi> which inhabits in this place, will tell me what it hath heard from the mouth of my faireſt Shepheardeſſe; and therefore it is the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Oracle which I can conſult withall. Then clearing up his voice, he began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire thus of it.</p>

               <p>Although <hi>Silvander</hi> knew well enough, that he was his own Anſwerer, and that the Aire being beaten by his voice into the concavities of the Rock, was reverberated into his ears; yet could he not chuſe, but reſent great conſolation from the auſpicious Anſwers which he received; conceiving, that nothing was governed by Chance, but all by an All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Providence, and therefore he believed thoſe words which the Rock returned to his ear, were inſpired into his tongue by ſome good Demon, that loved him; ſo as in this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, he followed the cuſtome of all Lovers, who uſe to flatter themſelves in what they deſire, and find ſuch hopes out of very bare appearances, in which there in no appearance of reaſon. After he had given thanks unto the Genius of the Rocks, and to the Nymphs of <hi>Lignon,</hi> he intended to go and preſent himſelfe unto his Shepheardeſſe, at the field of <hi>Mercury,</hi> for there ſhe uſed to call, in her way to <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> and as he winded his courſe that way, he eſpied afar off the Nymph <hi>Leonida,</hi> and the generous <hi>Paris,</hi> who hearing his voice turned towards him, as well to enquire of the Shepheardeſſes <hi>Aſtrea Diana,</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> as to enjoy his good company: For though <hi>Paris</hi> did well enough know what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection he bore unto <hi>Diana;</hi> yet did he love and eſteem him very much, becauſe he could never believe, that that wiſe and diſcreet Shepheardeſſe could prefer him before himſelfe, by reaſon of the grandure of <hi>Adamas,</hi> who for his quality of Grand Druide, was, next unto <hi>Amaſis,</hi> the moſt honoured by all the Country: never conſidering, that Love uſeth not to meaſure by the Ell of Ambition or Merit, but by opinion only. <hi>Silvander,</hi> whoſe education in the <hi>Phocencian</hi> and <hi>Maſſellian</hi> Univerſities, had compleatly civilized, though the meeting of <hi>Paris</hi> was but halfe pleaſing to him, yet he turned to the Nymph and him, to ſalute them. I need not ask you (ſaid <hi>Leonida</hi> unto him, and ſmiled) what thoughts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained you in this ſolitary place, for I am ſure, that <hi>Diana</hi> was the chiefe: But I would gladly know, why you do prefer the thoughts before the fight of her; and what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions does invite you from her preſence? I will not deny, Madam, ſaid he unto her, but that thoſe pleaſing thoughts whereof you ſpeak, were my deer companions, as well in this place as every where elſe, when I am abſent from <hi>Diana:</hi> But, that I ſhould think them more deer unto me then the ſight of her, give me leave to tell you, that though it ought to be ſo, yet I have not obtained ſo much Maſtery of my ſelfe; and though you now ſee me without her, it is only to paſſe away more ſweetly in contemplation thoſe houres, which her r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

her, at the field of <hi>Mercury:</hi> for now's the time ſhe uſeth to be there, in her way to <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and my intention was to wait upon her. And we (anſwered <hi>Leonida)</hi> came with reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to ſpend the remainder of this day with thoſe fair Shepheardeſſes; and therefore I beſeech you, Shepheard, conduct us thither; and by the way, tell us, why the thoughts of her you adore, ought to be more dear unto you then her preſence, which is the firſt cauſe of them? For my part, I conceive it ſo diſcordant to reaſon, that I cannot imagine how it ſhould be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Silvander,</hi> in obedience to her commands, ſhewing a Path-way which was a nearer cut thorough a great Meadow, began thus to reply; The queſtion, Great Nymph, is of no ſuch great difficulty to be underſtood, if it be but taken as it ought; for it is moſt certain that the eyes are the doores by which Love firſt enters into our ſoules. If any doe fall in love upon report of beauty and perfection of abſent parties, that is either a love not laſting: nor violent, being rather a ſhaddow than any real love; or elſe the ſoul which received it, had ſome grand defect in it ſelf; for reports having commonly as many falſehoods as truths, that judgement which builds upon any ſuch uncertain foundation, cannot bee found, nor proceed from a well-tempered ſoul; but as that which produceth a thing, is not the ſame which gives it nutriment, and makes it grow up to perfection, ſo it may be rightly ſaid of Love. Our Ewes bring forth their Lambs, who at firſt doe ſeek a little nutriment from their Milk, yet it is not that Milk which brings them up unto perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but it is a more ſolid nutriment which they receive from the graſſe which they feed upon: So likewiſe the eyes may conceive and produce a green infant-affection, but there muſt be ſomething more ſolid and ſubſtantial to make it grow unto perfection, and that muſt be by a knowledge of the virtues, beauties, merits, and a reciprocal affection of the party loved. Now this knowledge does take its originall indeed from the eyes, but it muſt bee the ſoul which muſt afterwards bring it to the reſt of judgement, and by the teſtimonies both of eyes and eares, and all other conſiderations, concoct a verity, and ſo ground upon it. If this verity bee to our advantage, then it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth in us ſuch thoughts, whoſe ſweetneſſe cannot be equalled by another kinde of contentment than the effects of the ſame thoughts. If it be onely advantageous to the party loved, then doubtleſſe it doth augment our affection, but yet with violence and inquietude: and therefore no queſtion but abſence doth augment love, ſo it bee not ſo long as that the very image of the party loved be quite effaced; Whether it be that an abſent Lover never repreſents unto his fancy but onely the perfections of the perſon loved; or whether it bee, that the underſtanding being already wounded will not fancy any thing but what pleaſeth it; or whether it be that the very thought of ſuch things does adde much unto the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the party loved: Yet this is infallibly true, that he does not truly love, whoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection does not augment in abſence from the perſon loved. For my part (anſwered <hi>Leoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da)</hi> My judgement is much different from yours, and I have ever been of opinion, that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is the greateſt, and moſt dangerous enemy which Love hath. Preſence, replied the Shepheard, is without compariſon much more, as wee may ſee by dayly experience; for you ſhall find a hundred loves that change in preſence, for one in abſence; and to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that preſence is more enemy unto love, conſider, that if one abſent ceaſe loving, its ceſſation i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> without any violence of ſtrugling, and the change is onely becauſe the memory is by degrees ſmothered with oblivion, as a fire is with its own aſhes; but when love breaks off in preſence, it is never without a noiſe and extream violence, and (which is a ſtrange argument <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>n<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that proceeds from this reaſon; A lover is alwaies either loved or hated, or held in a degre of indifferency; if he be loved, as abundance is apt to glut, ſo love being loaden in preſence with too many favours, grows weary: If hee be hated, then hee meets with ſo many demonſtrations of that hate every minute, as at length he is forced to eaſe himſelf If hee be in a degree of indifferency, and finds his love ſtill ſlighted, he will at length, if he be a man of any courage, make a retreate, and reſiſt the continuall affronts which are put upon him; whereas in abſence, all favours received cannot by their abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance glut, ſince they do rather ſet an edge upon deſire: And the knowledge of hatred en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into our ſouls onely by the ear, the blow ſmarts not ſo much as that which is received by ſight: and likewiſe diſdain and ſlight, bee much more tolerable in abſence than in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; doubtleſſe therefore abſence is much more fit to preſerve affection than preſence is. I muſt needs confeſſe (anſwered the Nymph) that there happens many accidents in preſence which deſtroyes love, that abſence is exempted from. But for all that, you cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53526:104"/>
me, but that I muſt needs think the ſight of the party loved, does augment love much more, than by not ſeeing her; for carreſſes and favours are the food of love; and thoſe which are conferred in preſence, are far greater, and more ſenſibly obliging, than any others. I thought, Madam (anſwered the Shepheard) that I had already ſufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered your demand; but ſince it is your pleaſure to deſire more clear reaſons, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to give them. It hath already been ſaid, that Love doth firſt begin at the eyes, but it is not the eyes that doth nouriſh it: Beauty and goodneſſe without any more, give it a growth in us, when they are once known: Now the knowledge of this Beauty indeed comes firſt by the eyes; but when that knowledge is once in our ſouls, wee may love after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards without the help of eyes, which you will eaſily grant if ever you were in love: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and tell mee, would you loſe your love if you loſt your eyes? No, certainly, and therefore you muſt needs confeſſe, it is not your eyes which does preſerve your love. As for the knowledge of goodneſs it is produced either by actions, or by words, both which doe ſtand in need of preſence, to be firſt known, but afterwards not at all; for that knowledge is afterwards preſerved in the ſecret Cabinet of the memory, whereupon a ſoul does after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſufficiently feed. Then I beleeve you know, Madam, that the more knowledge one hath of the party loved, the more doth love encreaſe; but then, it is apparent, that the turbulent motion of the ſenſes, doe infinitely hinder the clearneſſe of the underſtanding; and as the plummets of a Clock, the one cannot aſcend unleſſe the other doe deſcend, ſo when the ſenſes are up, the underſtanding part muſt needs bee down and ſo the contrary, when the ſenſes are abſent, the Intellectuals are beſt preſent, and does work more perfectly than they would if they were diſturbed by any objects of the eye, which is able to doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but look, and deſire, and ſigh. If you would think ſeriouſly upon any matter, has not wiſe Nature taught you to put your hand upon your eyes to the end that the ſight ſhould not divert the underſtanding another way? And therefore hence you muſt needs conclude with me in my argument, and confeſs, that Love digeſts it ſelf better in abſence than in preſence. But if it be ſo, ſaid <hi>Paris,</hi> how comes it to paſſe that all Lovers ſhould ſo paſſionately deſire the ſight of them they love? It proceeds from ignorance, anſwered <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander:</hi> He cannot attribute unto himſelfe the name of a Lover, who thinkes his love ſo great that it is impoſſible it ſhould augment: If any be of that opinion, he will never ſeeke after any means to increaſe it, nor bee in any queſt of further knowledge, but reſts himſelfe contented with as much onely as his eye can afford him, without any deeper contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But, O great Nymph, what a vaſt difference there is betwixt a love that is nouriſhed by the eyes, and a love that is nouriſhed by the underſtanding? As much doubtleſs as the ſoul is ſuperiour to the body, ſo much is the underſtanding to be preferred before the eyes. And abſence in ſuch is ſo far from diminiſhing love, that it augments and begets freſh and violent deſires to augment it; and contemplation of a Beauty does imprint it deeper into the fancy than any eye can. If it be ſo, ſaid <hi>Paris,</hi> I wonder you doe not abſent your ſelfe from <hi>Diana,</hi> to the end you may the more love her. I told you before (anſwered <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)</hi> that I ought to doe ſo, but that I have not yet obtained ſo much maſtery over my ſelf; for, generous <hi>Paris,</hi> we are all but men, I mean all imperfect; and the imperfections of humanity are not upon a ſudden removed: We are all ſenſitively inclined, and love to ſee, taſt, ſmell, and touch, and muſt needs hanker after theſe corporal ſenſes. This is the point unto which I have not yet arrived, and unto which I ought. Reaſon will forbid ſuch conſiderations, and bid us act all by the intellectual faculties: Nature beſtowed the ſenſes upon us onely for inſtruments, by which the ſoul may receive the knowledge of things, but not to be our companions in the pleaſures and felicities of them, as being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether incapable of ſo great a good.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe had continued longer, if they had not by chance heard <hi>Phillis</hi> ſing neare the field of <hi>Mercury:</hi> Shee was ſitting with another Shepheardeſſe under a ſhady tree, looking upon their Flocks as they were feeding untill the heat of the day was over. As ſoon as <hi>Silvander</hi> heard her tone hee turned his head that way and knowing them, hee turned his head again ſo ſuddenly, that <hi>Leonida</hi> could not chuſe but ſmile. What doe you hear and ſee ſaid ſhe, which cauſeth you to turn your head ſo quickly away? I have ſeen, Madam, ſaid he, her whom I never ſee without ſorrow: <hi>Phillis</hi> I meane, the moſt cruel of my enemies, ſince ſhe is the cauſe of my ſervitude. At the very ſame time, <hi>Lycidas</hi> was walking the ſame way, and was upon them before he was aware. Jealouſie which made him fly all company, made him ſhun <hi>Silvander</hi> more than any other; but now Civility conſtrained him to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>Leonida</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> and being invited to follow them, though at firſt he would have
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53526:104"/>
deſired their pardon with ſome frivolous excuſes: But <hi>Leonida,</hi> who loved him for <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladous</hi> ſake, was ſo importunate with him, that he was forced to make one in the company: And <hi>Paris,</hi> who was very deſirous to know where <hi>Diana</hi> was, did ask him, if he knew who it was that was with <hi>Phillis</hi> under that ſhady Tree. <hi>Lycidas,</hi> who had not yet taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them, looked, and then anſwered, that it was <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> Then going on their way, <hi>Leonida</hi> reſumed the diſcourſe, which ſhe had begun with <hi>Silvander;</hi> And why Shepheard, ſaid ſhe unto him, are you ſo offended againſt that Shepheardeſs? for though ſhee be the cauſe of your love, yet is ſhee alſo the cauſe of your becoming a more accompliſhed man: And I beleeve you will confeſs that love is able to adde much ornament unto our ſoules; and if it be ſo you are rather much obliged unto her. I muſt needs confeſſe, anſwered <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander,</hi> that I believe without <hi>Phillis,</hi> I had not fallen in love; but I muſt tell you withall, that ſhe is the cauſe that I have loſt my liberty, and am leſſe my own than hers whom I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore: And I muſt alſo tell you, that liberty is of ſo high a price, that I am not ſo much obliged to her for making me more accompliſhed, as I am diſobliged to her for the loſſe of my dear and deſirable freedom. But, added the Nymph, by her means you may perhaps obtain the affection of her whom you adore and love. And a well born ſoul, as yours is, will ſet ſuch a value upon that, be it at any rate whatſoever, as he cannot complain againſt her who is the cauſe of it; A well born and generous ſoul, replyed he, will not upon any termes thank her who is the cauſe of her ſervitude; for ſervitude, be it in what degree it will, is ſtill ſervitude. At the firſt when <hi>Lycidas</hi> heard <hi>Phillis</hi> named, he ſtood ſtill with much attention, but after he had heard all the diſcourſe and replyes of <hi>Silvander,</hi> he did beleeve that he really loved her; and not being able to hide his Jealouſie as he deſired, he could not chuſe but ſay unto him, I beſeech you, Shepheard, tell mee, Doe you indeed love this Shepheardeſſe ſo much as you ſeem to doe? <hi>Silvander,</hi> who never thinking of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> had talked thus unto <hi>Leonida,</hi> and knowing that this queſtion did proceed from Jealouſie, hee had a minde to keep him ſtill in his doubt, and therefore would not either deny, or confeſſe what he asked, but onely ſaid thus unto him; I beſeech you, <hi>Lycidas,</hi> tell mee what you doe think? I ſee anſwered he, ſo many diſſimulations, that my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot determine any certainty upon them. Since my diſſimulations, ſaid <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> doe blind your judgement, I beſeech you tell me, what is your deſire? My deſires, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Lycidas</hi> are not any thing dependant upon you, whoſe actions are very indifferent unto me: and therefore, I referre them unto your own imaginations. Since you are not pleaſed to acquaint me with your will, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> if I doe any thing which ſhall diſpleaſe you, blame your ſelf only, and arm your ſelf with patience. <hi>Lycidas</hi> would have replyed, and perhaps ſomewhat ſharply, if <hi>Leonida,</hi> who foreſaw it, had not hindred him with an excuſe that ſhe was deſirous to hear <hi>Phillis</hi> ſing; for they were ſo neare as to hear her words, which were theſe,</p>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53526:105"/>
then roſe up and acquainted her with the comming of <hi>Leonida</hi> and <hi>Paris. Phillis</hi> had not ſo much leaſure as to check him for his rude intruſion, becauſe <hi>Leonida</hi> was ſo neer, that ſhe was forced to riſe, and pay that civill duty which was due unto her. <hi>Silvander</hi> offered to lead her by the arme, but ſhe ſeeing <hi>Lycidas</hi> in the company, did repulſe him, which was no ſmal wound in the ſoul of the jealous <hi>Lycidas,</hi> who perceiving that <hi>Phillis</hi> ſaw him, did believe, that ſhe repulſed him only, becauſe it was in his preſence. But after all complements of all ſides were performed, all of them ſat down under a ſhady tree, and <hi>Silvander</hi> reſolving to add fewell unto the jealouſie of <hi>Lycidas</hi> he fell down upon his knees before <hi>Phillis:</hi> Well, my fair ſhepheardeſſe, ſaid he unto her, how long is it your pleaſure our war ſhall continue? What terme have you limited unto my ſervices? How long will you delight in thoſe pains which you have cauſed me to endure? Though you do imploy all your Art and Armes againſt me, yet, I hope in the end the victory will be mine. <hi>Phillis</hi> knew well enough, that this ſhepheards ſpeeches had relation only unto the wager that was between them, who ſhould love <hi>Diana</hi> beſt, and therfore received his expreſſion, in that ſence they ought to be underſtood. But <hi>Lycidas,</hi> who thought that this wager was only an invention betwixt them, to umbrage their affection, he took it in another ſence. Which ſhe plainly perceiving, ſhe caſt her eyes alwaies upon him, and to undeceive him in his opinion, anſwered <hi>Silvander</hi> in this manner: Shepheard, Shepheard, there is no ſuch neceſſity of uſing all my power to vanquiſh you, in the wager that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us, and therefore I dare aſſume ſo much confidence as to tell you, that I ſhall get the victory. <hi>Silvander</hi> knew what <hi>Phillis</hi> deſigned, and therefore, by way of contradiction, anſwered her: None can be ignorant of your power and <hi>Silvander,</hi> the leaſt of any Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard about <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

If it be ſo, replyed ſhe, you are like unto thoſe that blinde themſelves with looking at the Sun, when as the Sun is not in any fault, nor ever mindes them. Ah Shepheardeſs, anſwered he, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo does behold the Sun-ſhine of your eyes, and is not blinded, is unworthy to behold it. I cannot tell (ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> and bluſhed at his words) what your deſigne is in ſpeaking thus, but I am ſure, our Miſtreſs ſhall be acquainted with theſe diſsembling expreſſions, which, ſince the wager is to be determined very ſhortly, I am very confident will coſt you very deer, and then you will feel the ſmart of over late repentance. Do not think, Shephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs, ſaid he, that I ſhall ever repeat of any expreſſions of my affection to you, but on the contrary, I ought rather to be ſorry, that I have been ſo long without any declaration of it, and ought not to fear the menaces wherewith you threaten me. <hi>Phillis</hi> knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> alſo, that he mocked her; but that was no ſatisfaction to the ſuſpition which theſe words did kindle in the minde of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> who perceiving how <hi>Phillis</hi> was netled at them, was the more fortified in his opinion. At the laſt, ſhe ſaid unto him. I think, <hi>Silvander,</hi> that you have laid a wager, that you would diſpleaſe me with this language; or elſe you come to practiſe upon me what you ſhall ſay unto your Miſtreſs. If that be his aime, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> his beſt way would be, to be plain, and ſpeak unto you, as if you were <hi>Diana</hi> her ſelfe, and not to diſſemble ſo unto you. Nay, nay, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> that's all one, my aime is to let her underſtand the qualitie of my affection. And then he prepared himſelfe to proceed. I conjure you ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> by her, whom of all the world you love moſt, to let me be quiet, and content your ſelfe, that I do know more of your affection, then you can expreſſe. Theſe conjurations, ſaid he, are too powerfull to be contradicted, and the declaration which you have made too advantageous, not to content me; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince it is your pleaſure, I am ſilent. You do oblige me by it, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> for I cannot endure your language; it is more fit you went and helped <hi>Diana,</hi> whom I left in her Cabin, much troubled about her beloved Lamb <hi>Floretta,</hi> which is dead, or neer it. If you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me, replyed <hi>Silvander,</hi> and will undertake the charge of my flock till I return, I will go unto her. Nay, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> if that be all, I do command you; and will undertake the charge of your flock. Then <hi>Silvander,</hi> as if he durſt not diſobey what ſhe commanded, went unto the place where <hi>Diana</hi> was, leaving <hi>Phillis</hi> very glad of his departure, and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas</hi> the moſt jealous Shepheard in all the Country: For, though <hi>Silvander's</hi> language did much diſpleaſe, yet, the diſpleaſures which he obſerved in <hi>Phillis,</hi> were much more ſtinging; and her conjuring him by the perſon whom he moſt loved, was moſt of all offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to him: But her taking the charge of his flock upon her, this action pierced him to the very heart and yet the poor Shepheardeſſe did all this, only becauſe ſhe thought <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Mean time <hi>Silvander</hi> coming to the Cabin of his Shepheardeſſe, he found all that <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> had ſaid was true; for he found <hi>Diana</hi> ſitting upon the ground, with her beloved ſheep in her lap, which ſeemed to be dead, ſometimes rubbing it, ſometimes putting ſalt into its mouth, but all to no purpoſe, for the ſheep tumbled upon the ground, and lay for dead, which grieved the Shepheardeſſe very much, for ſhe loved it above all the reſt. When ſhe was out of all hopes, and perhaps accuſed ſome of her neighbours of Witchcraft, for looking upon it with ſome malevolent eye; <hi>Silvander</hi> came in, and after a ſalute asked her, what ſhe did upon the ground? You may ſee without asking me, ſaid ſhe if you do but look in what a condition my dear <hi>Floretta</hi> is in. The Shepheard kneeled down, looked ſeriouſly upon it, and ſtopped its noſe with one of his fingers, to hinder it from breathing: But aſſoon as it was let alone, after a little faint ſneez, it began to turn round about untill it fell. <hi>Silvander</hi> having diſcovered its diſeaſe, looked very jocundly upon <hi>Diana:</hi> Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble not your ſelfe, fair Miſtreſſe ſaid he unto her, your beloved <hi>Floretta</hi> will recover again; it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diſeaſe is not cauſed by any Witchcraft, but rather by the heat of the Sun, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving offended the brain, hath cauſed this diſeaſe, which is called the <hi>Vertigo,</hi> a convulſion of the nerves, which have their ſcource from the brain, and cauſeth them to go round. Time doubtleſſe will cure it, without any other Phyſick; but yet I know a Simple, which growes in the next Meadow, which will be an infallible cure, which, if you pleaſe to give me leave. I will apply. Pleaſe (ſaid the Shepheardeſſe, glad of the good newes) yes with all my heart; and that I may be acquainted with that herb againſt another time, I will go with you. I ſhall be moſt glad of that, replyed he, in a double reſpect; the one, in doing you an acceptable piece of ſervice; the other, in having your company, which I ſhall think the beſt beſtowed part of my time. Upon this, they left the ſheep in cuſtody of thoſe in the Cabin, and went to gather this Plant: <hi>Diana</hi> all the way gave the Shepheard thanks for his good will: And <hi>Silvander</hi> having by chance obſerved the Plant as he came, he went preſently to it again, and gathering a good quantity, they ſqueezed the juice of it into the ears of the Sheep, which had no ſooner received it, but it immediately began to ſhake its head, and after two or three ſneezes, it began to bleat, and call for the reſt of his fellowes, and began to eat. But <hi>Silvander</hi> taking it by the neck, did put it into a room by it ſelfe, and wiſhed <hi>Diana</hi> not to let it come out all that day, by reaſon of the Sun's heat. <hi>Diana</hi> not contenting her ſelfe with the cure of her beloved ſheep, and with the knowledge of the herb, would yet by any means know the name of it. The Plant, replyed <hi>Silvander,</hi> hath many names; ſome give it the name of <hi>Cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When I ſee them ill, ſaid ſhe, I will apply the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, not only unto my own, but unto any's elſe, aſſoon as I can. I would you were as willing to do ſo, replyed he, as I ſee you are the contrary. Good <hi>Silvander,</hi> replyed <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> do not ſpoil the courteſy you have done me in curing my deer <hi>Floretta,</hi> by injuring me with ſuch a thought: but we had better go, and ſeek out my Companions, who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe are all in much trouble for me. Upon this, ſhe went to the field of <hi>Mercury,</hi> full of joy for the cure of her ſheep; and by the way ſhe underſtood, that <hi>Leonida</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> were with thoſe Shepheardeſſes, unto whom ſhe went: Preſently after, ſhe ſaw them all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming towards her; for <hi>Paris</hi> hearing of <hi>Diana's</hi> griefe, deſired all the company to go unto her, and try if they could give any good advice for the cure of her ſheep: But when they ſaw her comming afar off, they ſtayed, ſuppoſing the ſheep to be either cured or dead; and as chance was, it was juſt in the field of <hi>Mercury,</hi> where foure waies met: And becauſe the baſis on which the ſtatue of <hi>Mercury</hi> did ſtand, was raiſed above the levell three ſteps, they ſat round about it, and ſome looking one way, ſome another, <hi>Leonida</hi> eſpied two Shepheards and a Shepheardeſſe, coming, as it were from mount <hi>Verdun,</hi> who ſeemed to be at ſome odds; for the actions of their hands, armes, and all parts, did ſhew them to be in ſome paſſionate diſpute, eſpecially the Shepheardeſſe, who thruſt from her ſometimes the one, and ſometimes the other, and would not hear them: ſometimes they ſtood ſtill and held her, as if they were deſirous to make her the judge of their controverſy; but ſhe ſtill ſtruck away their hands on both ſides, and then ran away from them, untill they overtook her again. Had they not ſometimes kneeled down before her, and otherwhiles ſubmiſſively kiſſed her hands, to ſtay her; one would have thought by her flight, that they would have offered ſome violence unto her. And drawing neer this ſtatue of <hi>Mercury,</hi> without taking any notice of the good company that was about it, <hi>Leonida</hi> ſhewed them unto all the company, and asked, if any knew them?

Town next adjoyning unto mount <hi>Verdun:</hi> They are not originally of that place, but ſtrangers, whom the fortune of their Parents conſtrained to come and dwell in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. If you deſire to ſee a young ſpringing beauty, give great hopes of rare perfection, look but that Shepheardeſſe in the face; and if you could by any means invite them to relate the difference that is betwixt them, I am confident it would prove an excellent diverſion: for they are both in love with that Shepheardeſſe, and ſhe will not entertain either: It was once my chance to hear ſome of their diſputes from their own mouths, and in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it was worthy of notice. The Shepheardeſſe is called <hi>Celida,</hi> he that is the taller on the right hand, is called <hi>Thamires,</hi> and the other <hi>Calidon. Lycidas</hi> had no ſooner ſaid this, but the ſtrangers were ſo neer them, that every one perceived the reports of <hi>Lycidas</hi> concerning <hi>Celida</hi> to be moſt true; for the luſtre of her beauty was ſo admirable, as it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted all eyes upon her; and though there might be found ſome nice defect in her beauty, yet any one might judge that time would bring it unto exact perfection. Whilſt every one was in a cenſorious contemplation of her, <hi>Leonida,</hi> prompted by the report of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> was very deſirous to know their difference; therefore ſhe advanced towards them, and after a civill ſalute, invited them in the name of all the company, to ſit down and reſt themſelves upon the ſtairs where they did ſit. <hi>Celidea,</hi> who was full of civility, and knew what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence was due unto the Nymph, and alſo very glad to avoid the importunities of the two Shepheards, ſhe did moſt willingly accept of <hi>Leonida's</hi> offer: And when all were taking their places, <hi>Diana</hi> came unto them, and after all civill ſalutations, ſhe ſat down amongſt the good company. <hi>Lycidas</hi> not being able to endure, that <hi>Silvander</hi> ſhould ſit next <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis;</hi> he ſtole out of the company before any took notice of him, and went to entertain his own ſad thoughts in the thick of the wood. Then <hi>Leonida,</hi> having cauſed <hi>Celidea</hi> to ſit next her on one hand, and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> on the other, <hi>Diana</hi> ſat next the ſtranger, and <hi>Paris</hi> next her. And becauſe <hi>Phillis</hi> had taken her place next the ſad <hi>Aſtrea, Silvander</hi> was with <hi>Thamires</hi> and <hi>Calidon;</hi> and though they did not ſit about the ſtatue, yet their backs were towards the fair Shepheardeſſes, and could not ſee them.
<hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> did ſit a little turning from them yet ſo, as by a little turning their bodies, they could both ſee and ſpeak unto them. Being thus ranged, <hi>Leonida</hi> ſeeing <hi>Celidea's</hi> modeſty would not permit her to ſpeak, and intending to inſpire her with more confidence, ſhe thus broke ſilence Although, fair <hi>Celidea,</hi> you were unknown unto us by ſight; yet the fame of your beauty hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched all our ears, which ſwells us all with extream curioſity, to know both you and your fortune. <hi>Lycidas</hi> hath partly acquainted us with the difference that is betwixt you and theſe two courteous Shepheards; but ſince there goes various reports of it, we ſhould be extreamly glad to hear the truth from your own mouth. Madam, anſwered the ſtranger, I ſhall be very loath to requite your civility with a tedious Hiſtory of our diſſentions; but, if the knowledge of it will any way contribute unto your ſervice, I ſhall moſt freely do it. Although the relation and remembrance of things paſt, be nothing pleaſing unto me; Yet, great Nymph, I cannot chuſe but deſire, that you might entertain the time with ſome other, and ſome better diſcourſe. Madam, ſaid <hi>Calidon,</hi> ſince this ſhepheardeſſe is unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to undertake the ſatisfaction of your knowledge, I beſeech you impoſe the task upon me; let me be the Relator both in the preſence of her and <hi>Thamires,</hi> to the end they may correct me, if I deviate from the truth. Great Nymph, ſaid <hi>Thamires,</hi> ſince it is I that am moſt interreſſed in the buſineſſe, it is moſt reaſonable you ſhould receive it from my mouth. Upon that account, replyed <hi>Celidea,</hi> it belongs moſt unto my ſelfe to be the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for you are both combined againſt me. I finde no reaſon in that, ſaid <hi>Calidon;</hi> for though, fair <hi>Celidea,</hi> you are againſt us both, yet both of us are for you: And as for <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires,</hi> I would have him know, that he who has moſt wrong, has moſt reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain: And, great Nymph, it is moſt peculiarly proper unto me, to inform you, of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream injury that is done me; for it is I whom the fair <hi>Celidea</hi> hath injur'd, in refuſing me, and it is <hi>Thamires</hi> that hath wronged me, in offering to raviſh that from me, which Love hath ordained unto me, and he himſelfe hath give me. To return your own arguments upon your ſelfe, ſaid <hi>Thamires,</hi> it is I that ought to ſpeak, being the moſt injured; I, that have reaſon to complain againſt <hi>Celidea,</hi> becauſe ſhe did once love me, and now does not; and againſt <hi>Calidon,</hi> becauſe he is the moſt obliged unto me, and yet the moſt ungratefull. And I, great Nymph, replyed <hi>Celidea,</hi> have moſt reaſon to complain, becauſe I am the But, at which both their importunities and vexations are ſhot at, and both of them are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to vex me to death, rather then let me enjoy any quietneſſe; ſo as if the party moſt interreſſed, muſt moſt complain, it is both their parts to be ſilent, and give me the liberty

                  </gap>. The diſpute had laſted longer, if <hi>Leonida,</hi> in a ſmiling manner, had not put an end unto it: and impoſing ſilence, ſhe propoſed, that the difference might be decided by Lot; and all being contented, the Lot fell upon <hi>Thamires,</hi> ſo as all fixing their looks upon him, after an humble reverence, he began thus:</p>

               <p>SInce it hath pleaſed the great <hi>Tautates,</hi> to make choice of me for a relater of the diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are betwixt us, I do profeſſe, that though it be the cuſtom of all interreſſed perſons to ſpeak only what is to their own advantage; yet I will not conceal and diſguiſe the truth in the leaſt manner, upon this condition, that when every one hath ſaid all they can for themſelves, I may have liberty to alledge my own reaſons apart. Be pleaſed to know then, great Nymph, that though both <hi>Calidon</hi> and my ſelfe do dwell in that Town which adjoynes unto mount <hi>Verdun,</hi> yet we are not of that Country; our Fathers and their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors are <hi>Boyens,</hi> who heretofore came out of <hi>Gaul,</hi> with the King of <hi>Beloveſes,</hi> and went to ſeek out new habitation beyond the <hi>Alpes;</hi> who, after they had planted themſelves there, and continued many ages, were in the end expulſed out of thoſe Townes which they had built, by a people called <hi>Romans;</hi> ſome being plundred of all their goods, went into <hi>Hircania;</hi> others returned into their own ravaged Country; our Anceſtors came into <hi>Gaul,</hi> and at laſt, linked themſelves by Marriages unto the <hi>Seguſians.</hi> Thus, wiſe Nymph, I do preſent unto your knowledge, that you may the better judge, how great the amity betwixt <hi>Calidon</hi> and me ought to be; for, being both of us <hi>Boyens,</hi> both deſcended from the ſame ſtock, and are Coſens, both ſtrangers, and heretofore both friends; all theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances are ſo many inviting arguments to love one another. Alſo, I do ingenuouſly confeſſe, that I did ever affect him as dearly, as if he were my own ſon; I may well be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to uſe that phraſe, for I have done him the offices of a kinde and good Father, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving educated him with as much indulgent care, as his own Father, who was my Uncle, could; even in his Infancy, when he had not ſo much knowledge as to diſcern good from bad, then, and ever ſince, was my indulgency over him. This fair <hi>Celidea</hi> was brought up by the prudent <hi>Cleontines,</hi> a neer neighbour unto my habitation; and though ſhe was then of an age far unlikely to cauſe love, (being ſcarce nine years of age) yet I muſt confeſſe, that her Infantine actions did much pleaſe me, and did take me in ſuch an unaccuſtomed manner, as I ſuited my ſelfe to her own young ſports; and though I was an age of years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove her, yet I played with her, as if I were as young as ſhe: How oft have I wiſht us of an equall age, and that her time might go forward, and mine backward? How many times have I ſtriven to withdraw my ſelfe from this vain affection? But not having power to do it, when ſhe came at ten years old, her beauty did put forth ſuch hopefull budds, as I was then not aſhamed at my loving an Infant: And I remember, upon this ſubject, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed theſe Lines.</p>

               <p>Now becauſe I did foreſee, that this Beauty would be the object of many eyes, and that my heart would not burn alone, I reſolved to be the firſt that ſhould inſinuate himſelfe into her minde: And conſidering, that her age was not yet capable of any ſolid affection, I cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her with childiſh toyes, and ſometimes talked of Love, of Paſſion, of Deſire, and of Flame; not that I thought her able to reſent ſuch things yet, but my end was, only to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtome her to thoſe phraſes, which commonly does more offend the ears of ſhepheardeſſes, then the effects themſelves do. I continued this life above a year, during which time, I would ſometimes ſteal a kiſſe, ſometimes put my hand into her boſome, and indeed, great Nymph, ſo tampered with her, that I did extreamly win upon her affection; for, when ſhe came to be eleven years of age, ſhe loved me, as ſhe her ſelfe ſaid, as well as ſhe did her Father; and her affection growing every day, ſhe vowed unto me, that ſhe loved me much above the degree of either Father or Brother: And when ſhe accompliſhed the age of twelve, ſhe loved me above all the world. And indeed, ſhe was ſo void of all malice, and ſo eaſy to be wrought upon at that age, as I could have engaged her unto any thing, if I had not deſigned to marry her when ſhe was a little older: But that conſideration, together with the reall affection I did bear unto her, did reſtrain me from all manner of evill thoughts. But, becauſe her ſimplicity made me fear, leſt any other ſhould deceive her, ſince many began already to court her, I was continually laying before her that high eſteem which every one did ſet upon conſtancy and fidelity; how contemptible thoſe were, that loved many; how almoſt all Shepheards are unfaithfull and deceivers, and there was no credit to be given to their words; nay, that it was a grand fault in any young woman to hear them. But one day, when ſhe anſwered me, That if this be a fault, then ſhe ought not to ſuffer me to ſpeak as I did; I perceived, that ſhe was ſtill in her innocent Infancy, ſince ſhe did not know my aim; and therefore I read her a loving Lecture upon Love and Amitie, telling her, that we came purpoſely into the world to love; that without this vertue, there was no delight in life; that it was Love which made all bitter ſweet, and paines eaſie; that whoſoever was without that quality, were extreamly miſerable, becauſe none could ever love them; that ſhe ſaw before her eyes the example of her Father and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; her Mother did Love her Father, and her Aunt her Uncle; but ſuch as love above one, are ſcorned by every one. But I beſeech you, replyed ſhe, are ſhepheards alſo obliged to love but one? Doubtleſſe they are, anſwered I: And do you not ſee, that I do love only you? But I beſeech you, tell me, ſaid ſhe, did you never love any one before I was born? and if I ſhould die, would you not love ſome other? I could not chuſe but laugh at this down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right demand, and in anſwer to it: Know, my Faireſt, (ſaid I unto her) that I did never love any till you did come into the world; and if you ſhould die before me, my love would die with you, and never live again for any other. And if you ſhould die before me ſaid ſhe, muſt I of neceſſity do the like? If I muſt, pray Father teach me how I muſt bury my Love in your Coffin. Daughter, ſaid I unto her, and ſmiled, you muſt ſtill let your love of me live in your memory, as I ſhould of you, if you did die before me. But how, ſaid ſhe, ſhould I love one that is dead? When you did at any time kiſſe me, and put your hand into my breaſt, if I did ask you, why you did ſo you alwaies anſwered, that it was, becauſe you loved me: And when you are dead, muſt I do the ſame? Fair Daughter, (ſaid I unto her, taking her in my armes, and kiſſing her) ſhepheardeſſes never uſe to hang upon the necks of thoſe ſhepheards whom they love, nor uſe any ſuch carraſſes as teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of their loves unto them: It is enough for them to ſuffer, and not act ſuch things. I beſeech you tell me, replied ſhe, is ſuffering ones ſelfe to be kiſſed and carraſſed in this manner, a teſtimony of love? Doubtleſſe it is, (ſaid I unto her) and therefore they ought
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53526:107"/>
not to ſuffer any ſo to do, unleſſe ſuch as they do love. And how do ſhepheards expreſſe their loves, ſaid ſhe unto me? As I do, anſwered I, when I kiſſe you, and take delight in playing with you. It ſeemes, ſaid ſhe, that when one would kiſſe me, and play in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with me, I may by that know he loves me.</p>
               <p>I do relate the ſimplicities of this young Shepheardeſſe unto you, Madam, that you may the better know, of what nature that affection was which ſhe bore unto me, and with what indulgent care I brought her up, more like a Father then a Lover; you may hereby conceive, how much beholding ſhe ought to be unto me, for not loving her after a vicious manner, nor working upon the ſimplicity of her age and diſpoſition; for you may perceive by her Queſtions and Anſwers, that her minde might have been tempered into what Mould ſoever I would. Perhaps you will wonder, that I, who was of more ſolid years, could take any delight in the converſation of one who was ſo very young; but if you will pleaſe to conſider, that Love is alwaies a childe, and takes moſt delight in youth, you will not think it ſtrange, that ſince I muſt love with a moſt pure and ſincere affection, an innocent and harmleſs beauty ſhould be moſt agreeable unto mee. And the very truth is, it was not I that was the author of this affection to her, but it was heaven that forced mee to love her whether I would or no. For I did often abſent my ſelf from her, and oppoſed all manner of arguments that reaſon could ſuggeſt againſt it, but that did rather augment than diminiſh my affection, which in the end grew to a moſt extreame height. About this time <hi>Calidon</hi> returned out of the <hi>Boyen</hi> Province, and was ſome eighteen years of age, or thereabouts. He was taller than uſually that age allows any; handſomly proportioned; his complexion, for a brown, extreamly fair; his mind, his garb, and his diſcourſe, was higher than perhaps his quality required, but yet not at all proud nor vain-glorious. I muſt confeſſe, that when I ſaw him ſo much improved, I loved him better than I did before: For before, I did love him onely in conſideration of Conſanguinity, and upon the recommendation of my Uncle; but when I found him to be ſo amiable, ſo extreamly well accompliſhed, and every way ſo well improved, that I having neither Wife nor Child, or then intending to marry, reſolved to make him my Heir, after my death, unto all my eſtate, which perhaps was not very inconſiderable. And to oblige him unto a reciprocal good will unto me, I declared as much unto all my Kindred and Neighbours. Now becauſe I did foreſee that dwelling in my houſe, it was almoſt impoſſible but he ſhould fall in love with the fair <hi>Celidea,</hi> I gave him a moſt ſtrict charge to look upon her onely with the eyes of a Brother, and not of a Lover: He proteſted with a thouſand aſſeverati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and oaths, that he would obey me in this, and all things elſe, and would not doe any thing in the world that ſhould diſpleaſe me: Yet before the Moon had run a full courſe, he was charmed with <hi>Celidea;</hi> and not daring to declare it unto her or me, or any elſe, after he had languiſhed a while, hee was forced to keep his bed; his eyes ſhrunk into his head, his complexion grown yellow, and grown ſo lean and altered, as he was not knowable. I brought the moſt knowing and experienced Phyſicians in all the Country unto him: If Fame cryed up any man, I ſpared neither coſt nor pains till I got him. I cauſed Sacrifices to be offered upon every Altar of the Country to appeaſe <hi>Tautates, Heſus, Tharamis,</hi> and <hi>Belinus,</hi> if <hi>Calidon</hi> by chance had offended them. I ſent to enquire of every Oracle and Augurer: I ſent for all the <hi>Bardi</hi> to come and pray with him: I ſent alſo for the beſt Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, to try if Muſick would allay the Melancholly which oppreſſed his ſoul. To bee ſhort, there was not one ſage <hi>Sarronide</hi> which at my requeſt did not come to viſit him, and give him wiſe precepts againſt grief and ſorrow. But all theſe had no operation; nor could all the teares which I ſhed by his beds ſide, get him to tell me the cauſe of his diſeaſe. Thus languiſhing in this manner, and no remedies could doe any good upon him, there was an old Phyſician, a friend of mine, who hearing of my ſorrows for <hi>Calidon,</hi> came unto me, to comfort me in my affliction; and after as good and wiſe advice as any humane Prudence could give, hee bade me reſign <hi>Calidon</hi> and my own will into the hands of <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates,</hi> and to believe, that if I did it unfeignedly, I ſhould receive more comfort than I could from all men living. When he was ready to goe away, he deſired to ſee <hi>Calidon:</hi> We went both into his chamber, he fell into talk with him, and conſidered him very ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly he felt his pulſe, obſerved his actions and geſtures; turned him every way to finde out his diſeaſe: And after hee had been two hours with him; Young man, ſaid hee unto him, chear up, and bee aſſured that you ſhall not dye of this diſeaſe; I have found out the cauſe, and I have known many ſick of the ſame, but never knew one dye of it. Then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Chamber, he took me aſide, and ſaid thus unto me; The age I have attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:53526:108"/>
unto, is great, and though I have not employed all my time very well, yet not all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably: I have ſtudyed the art of Phyſick very long, and have attained unto no meane reputation; I have been employed by many of the beſt quality amongſt the <hi>Boyens,</hi> the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guanonans,</hi> and the <hi>Allobrogians:</hi> Long experience have I had in my Art, which makes me ſpeak with more aſſurance than any that is younger than my ſelf can. Let me tell you, that <hi>Calidons</hi> diſeaſe proceeds not from the body but the mind; and if his body be ſick, it is becauſe of the near union it hath to his ſick mind, which makes it reſent the pain as if it were its own, as we ſee one friend ſenſible of the pain of another. And though theſe kinde of maladies be very painfull, yet are they not ſo dangerous as thoſe of the body; for the mind is not ſubject to corruption, or diſſolution of parts, but onely to change its quality. I tell you this, that you may not deſpair of the young mans cure, whoſe Malady, I think I have very rightly diſcovered; And by all ſymptomes, I finde that he is extreame paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately in Love, and is either ſleighted, or elſe dares not declare it. As ſoon as ever the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician ſaid ſo, I preſently apprehended, that certainly it was with the fair <hi>Celidea;</hi> and becauſe of my forbidding him, hee durſt not ſpeak of it. When the Phyſician perceived me ſad, in lieu of rejoycing at the matter, hee asked mee the reaſon, to whom I anſwered, that I was more in fear of him than ever, becauſe his malady was without the compaſſe of my cure, and he might love one I had no power over, or elſe a ſtranger, or perhaps ſome enemy, and therefore I ſaw no reaſon to rejoice. There is a remedy, ſaid he, againſt any thing but death, and therefore never fear but I ſhall keep <hi>Calidon</hi> alive; and if you will pleaſe to give me leave to be with him a few dayes, I ſhall diſcover well enough whether he be in love with any that has any dependance upon you, or with a ſtranger. You cannot hope, ſaid I unto him, ever to get it from his own mouth. No, no, ſaid he, that's not the way; but fear not, I ſhall bring it about: Matters of Love be they never ſo cloſe, may eaſily be diſcovered, if prudent artifice be uſed.</p>
               <p>But, great Nymph, I ſhould be extreamly tedious if I ſhould relate every trivial paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, therefore for brevities ſake, I ſhall onely tell you, that this Phyſician was for ſeven or eight daies never from <hi>Calidons</hi> bed ſide. In the mean time, he adviſed me to get all the young Shepheardeſſes in the neighbourhood to come and ſee him, under pretence of ſorrow for his ſickneſſe. As for the Phyſician, hee was alwaies holding him by the arme, and felt his Pulſe, to know when any cauſed an extraordinary motion in him. So it was, that <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidea</hi> at that time was gone a journey with <hi>Cleontine,</hi> and ſtayed away five or ſix daies, and therefore ſhe was almoſt the laſt of all the viſitants, though the neareſt neighbour: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived it ſo, that all my friends and neighbours ſent both their Siſters and Daughters to my houſe; &amp; when we were almoſt out of all hope to diſcover what I deſired to know this way, one came to tell us, that <hi>Celidea</hi> was at the door. As fortune was, the Phyſician held him by the arm at that time; and his pulſe did beat a ſlower pace than it had done all the day; but as ſoon as ever he heard <hi>Celidea</hi> named, it began to beat as if he were in a moſt high Feaver. The Phyſician finding this, did look him in the face, and ſaw his eyes more quick and lively than ordinary; his complexion came into his cheeks, and he ſaw ſo great an alteration every way, as hee would hardly ſtay till <hi>Celidea</hi> entred for better aſſurance; but when ſhe entred, his pulſe then did keep a mad mans time, and all parts were different from their ordinary temper. Therefore drawing me aſide, <hi>Thamires,</hi> ſaid he, It is not <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidea</hi> which enters into the Chamber, but it is <hi>Calidons</hi> Wife, if you would have him live. Oh heavens! how thoſe words pierced me to the heart? They ſtruck me dumb, I was not able to ſpeak one word. Afterwards, when I had a little recollected my ſelf; I asked him, whether conſidering the condition he was in, it were fit to marry him? No, ſaid he, it will be enough if you can procure the Shepheardeſs to give him ſome knowledge of her affection; and in the mean time you may talk with <hi>Clcontine,</hi> who being wiſe, will not bee againſt a match ſo advantageous.</p>
               <p>The Phyſician went away, and left me in a worſe condition than his patient. Oh what ſtrange contrarieties were in my ſoul? One ſide bade mee yeeld <hi>Celidea</hi> unto <hi>Calidon,</hi> for friendſhip ſake; Love, on the other ſide forbade the banes. But, ſaid Friendſhip unto me, <hi>Calidon</hi> will dy if you doe deny her; and there is no Phyſician but this, can cure him: And Love anſwered, how canſt thou live thy ſelf, if thou doeſt not enjoy her? Canſt thou not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount a vain paſſion (ſaid Friendſhip) and be ruled by the Laws of Reaſon? What reaſon is it, replyed Love, to dye thy ſelf, to make another live? Doe you not conſider (replyed Friendſhip) that <hi>Calidon</hi> is young, and therefore leſſe able than thy ſelf to maſter his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly paſſion? Wilt thou that art arrived at grave and ſtayed yeares, ſhew thy ſelf weaker
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:53526:108"/>
than he, or, to expreſs it a little better, wilt thou buy a little tranſitory pleaſure, that is paſt almoſt as ſoon as had, at ſo deare a rate as the death and eternal loſſe of <hi>Calidon?</hi> Away, away, change thy minde, conſider not what thou art, but what thou ſhouldſt be: Think how the Father of that young Shepheard will reproach thee: Did he not with his laſt dying breath recommend his young childe then in his cradle unto thy indulgent care? Didſt thou not ſwear he ſhould be as dear unto thee as thy ſelf? Doeſt thou not remember the many good offices thou receivedſt from him? Oh <hi>Thamires</hi> do not buy thy repentance at ſo dear a rate: Repent, repent for ſhame of an act ſo unworthy an ancient <hi>Boyen,</hi> from whence it is thy boaſt to be deſcended, and let not thy ſoul be continually gnawed upon by an evil conſcience?</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſſe, that theſe conſiderations had ſuch a prevalency with me, as I did once reſolve to part with <hi>Celidea,</hi> and reſign her unto <hi>Calidon.</hi> But, O Madam, what extream difficulties did I finde in the execution of it? Firſt, to the end this young Shepheard might recover his health, I begun with him, and acquainting him with my knowledge of his diſeaſe, I ſhewed him my extream deſire of his cure: At the firſt, he denyed it unto me, but at laſt hee did confeſſe it with watry eyes, and asked me forgiveneſſe, with ſo many apparent ſignes of ſorrow, that ſeeing his errour was by a moſt compulſive power of Love, I could not chuſe but take his fault upon my ſelfe. But the grand difficulty was to ſpeake unto <hi>Celidea</hi> for ſhee was ſo farre from loving him, that ſhee did down right hate him. And certainly this hatred proceeded from an Antipathy in Nature, ſince ſhe had not the leaſt ſhaddow of any cauſe for it; and the Shepheard had ſo many excellent good qualities, that in all reaſon they ſhould rather have gotten love than hatred: And yet ſhee would alwaies ſay unto me, that <hi>Calidon</hi> of all men ſhee knew, ſhould be the laſt man ſhe would love. But being reſolved to make this overture, ſo contrary both unto her will and my own, I was at an extream puzzle where, and how to begin. At laſt, I thought it beſt to break the Ice by degrees for to bid her downright to love <hi>Calidon,</hi> was not the way, both in reſpect of her affection to me, and diſaffection to him. I went therefore to work by degrees, and now ſhe was not to be treated as a child: I hinted unto her my extreame ſorrows for the Shepheard; how dear his life was unto me, and how I ſhould never enjoy any delights if I loſt him; That Phyſicians and all knowing perſons told me his malady proceeded from nothing elſe but ſorrow; and not knowing what was the cauſe, I could not chuſe but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire all them that loved mee, to ſtudy how to make him merry, or at leaſt to finde out the cauſe of his ſickneſſe: And that ſhe being one whom I loved and honoured moſt, ſhee was in ſome ſort obliged more than any to endeavour the cure of this Shepheard for my ſake: Therefore I conjured her by our friendſhip, to ſee him as often as ſhe could, and to carraſſe and cheer him up, to keep him from that melancholly which would kill him. She who did really love me, did promiſe to doe it ſo oft as ſhe conveniently could: And indeed did ſo, which on the one ſide did content me, and on the other did ſo grieve me, as I did thinke I ſhould not live. I had a conceit that her familiarity with him would in time engage her to liking of him, which afterwards might the more eaſily make her bee perſwaded unto love: Shee having no other deſign, did onely as ſhee promiſed, but did not change her minde. However this wrought good effects upon <hi>Calidon,</hi> who receiving ſo many favourable vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits, and being ſo kindly carraſſed above his expectation, did in a ſhort time begin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover: And though he was not preſently cured, yet there was apparent ſignes of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now becauſe that ſhee was weary of this life, and becauſe I ſaw my deſign did not take according to my thoughts, I intended to oblige her another way. I addreſſed my ſelf unto <hi>Cleontine,</hi> acquainted her with my affection unto <hi>Calidon,</hi> with my intention of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him my Heir; I repreſented unto her the quality of this young Shepheard, his virtues, and to be brief, with the love he had unto <hi>Caledon,</hi> and uſed all manner of arguments that might advance the match. Judge great Nymph, if I went not very farre, and whether he be not much obliged unto me. <hi>Cleontine</hi> thinking the Match to be advantageous, did thank me for my good will unto <hi>Celidea,</hi> then gave me her word that ſhe would uſe all her endeavours in favour of <hi>Calidon;</hi> but that the young Shepheardeſſe had a Mother who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her exceedingly well, and ſhee could not diſpoſe of her without her conſent: But ſhe would motion it unto her and in the mean time prepare <hi>Celidea</hi> as wel as poſſibly ſhe could. Thus, Madam, you ſee how miſerable my fortune was: I invented all poſſible ways to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive my ſelfe of the onely good that could render my life pleaſing unto me; and I did foreſee, that though I did bring it paſſe, yet I ſhould reap no contentment by it. Had I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for <hi>Calidon</hi> that which I did endeavour, what could I ever have hoped for in my
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:53526:109"/>
life? Had I not obtained it, how ſhould I have grieved for that Shepheard, who was asdea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> unto me, as if he had been my own child? This being my condition, which I knew not whether to tearm a death or a life one day after I had received <hi>Cleontine's</hi> anſwer, I went unto <hi>Celidea,</hi> with whom I was not ſo familiar as formerly: My dear and faireſt Daughter, (ſaid I unto her) <hi>Cleontine</hi> has acquainted me with her intention, and I conceive, that you ought to approve of it. Then fearing ſhe ſhould ask me what it was, I ſeemed to have earneſt and ſuddain buſineſſe to do, and went away, leaving her in a great doubt what it was: But I went away with a ſad heart; for, ſtrive what I could againſt my own will, I could not blot her out of my ſoul; and as often as I fancyed <hi>Celidea</hi> in the armes of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I muſt confeſſe, that I had not reſolution enough to endure the very thought of it. Imagine in what condition I ſhould have been, if the Marriage had taken effect, which tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I did moſt vigorouſly endeavour for <hi>Calidon's</hi> fake?</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Cleontine,</hi> thinking my propoſition advantageous for <hi>Celidea,</hi> ſhe took her aſide, and broke the matter unto her: Then, before ſhe asked her opinion of it, ſhe told her what was he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>; and the more to induce her, told her, how much ſhe was obliged unto me, for motioning it unto her. That Shepheardeſſe Madam, can beſt tell you, how ſhe ſtarted at the motion, eſpecially when ſhe heard that it came from me: but ſo it was, that ſhe had much ado to conceal her anger in <hi>Cleontin's</hi> preſence; yet, giving her a very modeſt anſwer, though it were very far from her thoughts, ſhe referred her ſelfe unto her judgment, and the pleaſure of her Mother, unto whom ſhe was never diſobedient. In concluſion, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to marry a Grave rather then <hi>Calidon,</hi> ſhe came unto me. Aſſoon as ever I ſaw her, I perceived that ſomething did trouble her, for her eyes trembled in her head; her eye-lids frowning and her colour higher than ordinary. But I could not imagine that ſhe ſhould be offended againſt me, nor believe, that <hi>Cleontine</hi> had told her the motion came from me. As fortune was I was under a great Elme alone, which ſtood by it ſelfe almoſt in the midſt of Mount <hi>Verdun's</hi> plain, neer the high way. As ſoon as ever I ſaw her I did riſe up, and holding her hand as I was went, I was amazed to ſee her pul back her arme, and look upon me with an angry eye: <hi>Thamires,</hi> ſaid ſhe, how dare you take her hand, whom you have given to another? Was it not enough, and too much, that you have abuſed me as long as ever the innocence of my age could endure it? Do you think your ſelfe ſo ſubtle, and me ſo ſimple, that now, being paſt a child, I cannot ſee your cunning perfidie? When ſhe ſaw me ſtand amazed, and did not anſwer: Nay, nay, <hi>Thamires,</hi> ſaid ſhe, never think to deceive me any more by your words, nor aſſurances of amity; I am now grown more crafty, and I wiſh to god I had alwaies been ſo then I ſhould not have now ſo much reaſon to complain of you. But go, ungratefull perſon and cruell, (yea, I may moſt juſtly call you both ungratefull and cruell, ſince you have ſo ungratefully forgotten the reaſons you had to love me, and ſince you have ſo cruelly abuſed my innocency by your craft). Away ungrateful and cruell man! What did you ever finde in me, that ſhould give you any occaſion to uſe me thus? Was there ever any old enmity between our Parents that you would revenge upon me? Did I ever attempt againſt your life? Have I ever ſpoken againſt you or any of your friends? Did I ever fail in my word or friendſhip? Have you ever found any fault in me, that did invite you to caſt me off? Or, do you now think me not wiſe, or rich, or fair enough, for you? If it be to revenge the fault of a Father upon a Daughter, me-thinks it, ſhould be an act unworthy of <hi>Thamires?</hi> If I did ever attempt againſt your life, why did you not take mine away at a blow, but put me into the power of an enemy, with whom I ſhould live a dyinglife every minute? If I be not fair enough, nor ſo vertuous as to pleaſe you, good <hi>Thamires,</hi> go and ſeek out a better. But alas, why muſt I as a pennance for a fault in nature, be put into the hands of him, whom nature it ſelfe makes me abhor? For gods ſake leave me in the ſame liberty you found me, when by your craft you began to deceive me, and content your ſelfe with thoſe ſorrowes I ſhall have all my life, for not knowing your deſigne ſooner. If ever I failed in friendſhip, I muſt confeſſe, you are juſt in doing the like. But, <hi>Thamires,</hi> I beſeech you, lay it in my diſh and tell me, wherein I ever failed. Ah! moſt unnaturall Shepheard, you are mute, and cannot ſpeak a word; Is it for the ſham: for the wrong you have done me? or, have you any new piece of ſubtlety againſt ſilly <hi>Celidea?</hi> Go, go, perfidious and diſloyall <hi>Thamires.</hi> This act hath put me out of opinion, that ever you loved me. The knowledge of your tyranny ſhall keep me for ever from ſubjecting my ſelfe unto any man in the world. Never think, that all you can do, ſhall ever make me <hi>Calidon's.</hi> Death ſhall be more welcome unto me, then the moſt accompliſhed Shepheard in all this Country. Let the memory of this be a ſad ſtain upon
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53526:109"/>
thy ſoul to eternity: And I am confident, the juſt gods will ſee me revenged. In offering to give me unto <hi>Calidon,</hi> you have for ever deprived your ſelfe of the trueſt and moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full affection that ever was; and never hope it will revive, unleſſe an univerſall conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould ſet the whole world a fire, and ſo kindle this love in me again. Away, away, there is not a man upon the face of the whole earth, but Monſters, and Tigers, that would devour me. Upon this, taking from her neck a platted Chain which I gave her, as ſhe gave it into my hand, ſhe broke it in pieces: Thus, ſaid ſhe, is our love to one another for ever broken, and never to piece again. She had no ſooner ſpoken theſe words, but ſhe ran away with a piece of the chain in her hand, and left the other in mine, who was in ſuch an extaſy, that I was not able to ſpeak one word by way of excuſe, nor follow her one ſtep I muſt confeſſe Madam, that theſe words did ſting me to the very heart; and when I did ſeriouſly conſider what good reaſon ſhe had to ſpeak them, I could not lay the blame upon her, but wholly upon my ſelfe: However, I kept my ſelfe ſtill conſtant to my reſolution, of endeavouring the contentment of <hi>Calidon.</hi> He, knowing that I had ſpoken of it unto <hi>Cleontine,</hi> and hearing the report of their Marriage publickly divulged, he did not much wonder, that his Shepheardeſſe ſhould never ſee him; but when <hi>Cleontine</hi> came to viſit him, conceiving it but fit for her ſo to do, ſince their Marriage was ſo much ſpoken of; ſo as in a few nights he recovered his former health, and got out of his bed, and a little after out of his Chamber. In the mean time, <hi>Celidea</hi> was much perplexed and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other hopes, but in the tender affection of her Mother, ſince ſhe ſaw I had gained <hi>Cleontine,</hi> aſſoon as ever ſhe ſaw her, ſhe fell down upon her knees, and would not riſe, untill ſhe had obtained a promiſe, never to marry her againſt her will. <hi>Celidea</hi> was ſo exceedingly contented with this aſſurance, as ſhcould not reſt, untill ſhe had advertiſed us of it, thinkinking her deſires not compleatly ſatisfied till then. It is very hard to ſay, great Nymph, whether I was more ſorry, or more pleaſed; for on the one ſide, I feared <hi>Calidon's</hi> relaps; and on the other, I was glad that none ſhould enjoy <hi>Celidea.</hi> But when I ſaw <hi>Calidon,</hi> though ſomething ſad, yet in health, I muſt confeſſe, that I was extreamly pleaſed at <hi>Celidea's</hi> repulſing him, and did in my heart commend her prudence and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; for I had a conceit, that all ſhe did was only to reſerve her ſelfe for me, not imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her anger againſt me was ſo high, as utterly to extirpate the affection which ſhe bore unto me; ſo as recollecting my ſelfe, I did confeſſe, that the injury which I had done her, was not with a deſigne to extinguiſh my love unto her, (for I never had any ſuch inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor could ever hope to be ſo much Maſter of my ſelfe) but only had a minde to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice it unto <hi>Calidon's</hi> health. So then muſt the act which I would have done be phraſed: for my aim was only at the ſaving of his life, and not at the ſatisfaction of his pleaſures. Theſe conſiderations being often in my minde, Love began to be more violent in me then ever; and eaſily it might, for having reſigned this fair one unto <hi>Calidon,</hi> only to ſave his life, and ſeeing that he lived ſtill, though ſhe was not his ſelf, I conceived, that my quitting her having wrought its intended effect, I might very juſtly fall on upon my own ſcore as I fell off for <hi>Calidon's.</hi> Upon this account, I went to the ſhepheardeſſe, I ſhewed her the reaſon why I dealt ſo with her, and why I did now dedicate my ſelfe wholly to her ſervice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeching and conjuring her, to pardon and forget the fault, if ſhe thought it to be one. To be briefe, I uſed the beſt arguments and eloquence I could deviſe, to advance my cauſe; but I found her to be ſo exceedingly altered, that all my arguments, excuſes, and reaſons, could not move her more then they could a Rock, nor obtain the leaſt glance of a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble look upon me As fortune was whilſt I was ſpeaking to her, <hi>Calidon</hi> comes in, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to finde me a very good ſecond, he advanced towards us, to ſpeak to her for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; but when he heard my words, never man was more amazed: he durſt not then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid me with breach of faith and abuſing him; but ſtepping back three or foure paces, with folded armes: Oh heavens! ſaid he, is there any loyalty in any man living? Is it he that brought me up, lie whom I call Father, and he, who hitherto hath done me all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent offices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is it he, I ſay, that puts a dagger into my heart, and ſends me to my grave? Unto which I returned a faint anſwer, ſhewed him the reaſons why I quitted <hi>Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> and why I did again apply my ſelfe to her. But Love did ſo tranſport him into ſuch violent raptures, that there could be no bitter invective, wherewith he did not aſperſe me. But the ſhepheardeſſe did laugh at us both: Nay, nay, ſaid ſhe, never ſtrive for <hi>Celidea,</hi> for neither of you have the leaſt ſhare in her: Not you, (ſaid ſhe, and turned to <hi>Celidon)</hi> for I never did love you: Nor you, (ſaid ſhe, and turned to me) becauſe you are extreamly unworthy of that love, which once I did bear unto you. Then ſhe left both in a confuſed
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53526:110"/>
amazement: We alſo parted. And ever ſince, that ſhepheard hath continued with one of his Kinſmen, and never came at his own Cabin. Three Moones have changed ſince this ſeparation, and do both he and I what we could, we could not obtain one good word from her; but, the more violent we are in our loves, the more violent ſhe is in her hatred. In the mean time, ſuch is my extream affection to her, that it will not admit of the leaſt diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but does ſtill more and more encreaſe: ſo as did ſhe but know it, I do believe, that ſince ſhe did love me before, out of an opinion I loved her, ſhe would love me much more now, becauſe I do love her now much more than I did then, and more than any man living can.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Thamires</hi> ended his relation; and after a while of ſilence, he began again. Now, Madam, ſaid he, as chance was, we met this ſhepheardeſſe upon the banks of the River <hi>Lignon;</hi> and becauſe love continues in us and diſdain in her, we both of us ſhewed her the beſt reaſons we had, to convince her, that ſhe ought to love one of us. I pleaded, that it was I upon whom her election ought to be.: <hi>Calidon,</hi> on the other ſide, whom I have ſo much obliged by many good offices, he very opinioatively maintaines, that it belongs to him. Now knowing that your wiſdome can much better underſtand reaſon, then I can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, I would with all my heart, to put an end to our long diſſentions, (for we are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy grown the common talk of our Town) that you, great Nymph, would be pleaſed to hear our reaſons and arguments from our own mouths, and ordain what you ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be juſt, for I ſhall moſt freely ſubmit my ſelfe unto your judgment: It would be a work well worthy of your ſelfe, it would be acceptable to the gods, and would infinitely oblige us all unto you. <hi>Leonida</hi> thanked him for the pains he had taken, in the relation of of the matter; and did aſſure him, that if he, and all thoſe who had any intereſt in the buſineſſe, did think her able to be the Judge, ſhe would moſt willingly arbitrate the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, according to the beſt of her judgment, upon condition they would all promiſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it otherwiſe, all their labour would be but loſt. <hi>Thamires</hi> kneeled down upon his knees, and ſaid: Oh, great Nymph, I do refer my life, my death, and the contentments of them, unto your wiſe judgment; if I do diſobey your doom, let our Druides excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate me from ever aſſiſting them at their holy ſacrifices, and forbid me for ever coming into the ſacred groves, or our celeſtiall woods. For my part; ſaid <hi>Calidon,</hi> if I do not the ſame, may the Miſleto of the ninth year be never wholſome unto me, let the great <hi>Tautates</hi> animate all his furies againſt me, and never let me be at reſt, if I do not ſubmit unto your judgment as proceeding from the great god. And becauſe <hi>Celidea</hi> ſtood ſilent, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſaid unto her. Are not you pleaſed, fair Shepheardeſſe, to be rid of all the importunities which you receive from theſe two Shepheards, and refer your ſelfe unto the judgment of this great Nymph? I am moſt willing to be rid of them anſwered ſhe; but I am afraid to fall into a greater miſery: And certainly, I ſhould refer the hazard of this judgment unto any, if the gods had not adviſed me the laſt night in a dream, to take another courſe: For, preſently after midnight, me-thought I ſaw my Father, who hath been long dead, open my breaſt, take out my heart, and caſt it as a ſtone in a ſling over the River <hi>Lignon;</hi> then ſpoke theſe words unto me: Go, my child, unto the other ſide of the fatall River <hi>Lignon,</hi> there thou ſhalt finde that heart which ſo much torments thee, or elſe a full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and reſt, untill thou comeſt unto me. Upon this, I awaked and therefore I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to paſſe over the River, to ſee if I can finde that tranquillity which is promiſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. However, Madam (ſaid ſhe, and addreſſed her ſelfe unto <hi>Leonida)</hi> you may be certain, that I ſhall never diſobey any command which you ſhall impoſe upon me, ſince I do believe that the gods will ſpeak by your mouth. Since it is ſo, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> I do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you all three, to give as juſt a Judgment, as I my ſelfe would receive upon the like occaſion: And that I may not erre in my judgment, <hi>Paris</hi> and theſe fair Shepheardeſſes and <hi>Silvander,</hi> ſhall help me with their advice, before I pronounce the Sentence. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Calidon,</hi> ſaid ſhe, ſhew me your reaſons, why you conceive <hi>Celidea</hi> ought to be yours, and not <hi>Thamires's,</hi> who hath ſo long been her Guardian, and brought her up as his own? That Shepheard then riſing up, and after a low reverence, he began in this manner.</p>

                           <p>OH great god of Love, who by thy unreſiſtable puiſſance haſt raviſhed from me all that reaſon was wont to have over my will, hearken I beſeech thee, unto the ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the moſt faithfull ſoul, that ever reſented the power which beauty, by thy means, hath over the hearts of men; and inſpire me with ſuch language and reaſon, as thou didſt, when I was weary of <hi>Celidea's</hi> ſcorn, and was reſolved to decline from her ſervice. Let this great Nymph be moved with my arguments; let her, whom thou haſt given me, and who was alſo given me by him that had the greateſt intereſt in her, be preſerved and kept for me, both againſt her own ſcorn, and againſt the violencies of him that would raviſh her from me. Were it not in hopes of aſſiſtance from this divinity whom I invoke, I durſt not, great Nymph, open my mouth againſt a perſon, whom of all men in the world I am moſt obliged unto: For I muſt needs ingeniouſly confeſſe, that <hi>Thamires,</hi> by his ſweet indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency towards me, has more obliged me, than my Father, who gave me life; the one gave me only a being, but the other a well-being. <hi>Thamires</hi> has been troubled with all the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xations of my child-hood, and hath brought me up even from my Cradle; he hath ſpared no paines nor coſt in my education, nor care nor prudence in cauſing me to be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed; ſo as the Appellation of Father is in all reaſon his due, and I muſt acknowledge my ſelfe his Child, having received from him all thoſe indulgencies, which thoſe names require. And in confeſſing all theſe obligations, how can I open my mouth againſt him, without incurring the ugly brand of ingratitude? If this diſpute did depend only upon my ſelfe, I had rather be in my grave ſleeping with my fathers, and wiſh that my Cradle had been my Coffin, rather then oppoſe <hi>Thamires</hi> in any thing: <hi>Thamires,</hi> I ſay, who hath made me what I am: <hi>Thamires,</hi> unto whom I owe all I have: <hi>Thamires,</hi> in whoſe ſervice, when I have ſpent all my life, yet halfe my obligations are not cancelled. But alas, it is all long of himſelfe; it is Love which commanded me; he himſelfe alſo commanded me. Let <hi>Thamires</hi> tell me, whether it be poſſible, that a heart which Love hath touched to the quick, can diſobey him in any thing? If he have found this to be true by experience, then I do conjure him by the god of Love, who hath ſuch power over his ſoule, to pardon that fault which I have been forced to commit againſt him; and that he give me leave to maintain, that all reaſon ordaines <hi>Celidea</hi> to love me, and that there is none but my ſelfe that can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto her. For to begin with the firſt point, what can <hi>Calidea</hi> anſwer if I call her before the Throne of Love, and if in the preſence of this equitable company, I do complain againſt her in this manner? This is the fair one, Oh great god of Love, which preſents her ſelf before thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is ſhe whom thou haſt commanded me to love and ſerve, upon hopes of ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as thou uſeſt to give unto thoſe that follow thee. If from the firſt minute of my begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, unto this inſtant, I did ever contrary thy will, if I have notalwaies continued in a full reſolution to ſpend my whole life in thy obedience; Then, Oh Love, who lookeſt into all hearts, and ſeeſt all my deſignes, let me be puniſhed as a perjured villain, and let all the thunderbolts of the great <hi>Tharamis</hi> fall upon me, as a perfidious perſon. But if truth and my words agree, and if never any loved like me, why doſt thou ſuffer her to deceive my hopes? why does ſhe not make good thy promiſes? and why wilt thou let her laugh at all thoſe miſeries, which thou haſt made me to endure for her? Aſſoon as ever I ſaw her, I loved her, and aſſoon as ever I loved her, I did dedicate my ſelfe and ſoul to adore her. But perhaps this affection is unknown unto her, or I have only acquainted the ſolitary Woods and Rocks with it. No, no, Oh Love, ſhe hath heard my complaints, ſhe hath ſeen my tears, ſhe knowes of my affection, ſomthing from my own mouth, more from <hi>Thami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, Cleontina,</hi> and other of my friends; but moſt of all from the effects of my paſſion. Has ſhe not ſeen me in the bed of death for her? has ſhe not held me by the hand, and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me from my grave, ſaying unto me, Live, live. <hi>Calidon,</hi> thy pretenſions are not hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe? And ſince I had ſuffered the very pangs of death, why did ſhe call me from that reſt, which my grave would have given me? If it was to make me die again without pitty, it was extream cruelty? Muſt I be puniſhed with a ſecond death, for obeying and adoring her? But perhaps ſhe will ſay, that I ought to meaſure her by my own Ell, and conſider, that as I have not power to quit her and love another; ſo ſhe being engaged another way, ſhe cannot diſengage her ſelfe to love me. Oh Love, theſe are only words, bare excuſes Let her ſhew the contract of this engagement, and if thou doſt not preſently adjudge it to be falſe,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:53526:111"/>
then let me be condemned. She never loved any, but the ſhepheard <hi>Thamires,</hi> as ſhe hath told me; but I dare ſay farther, and maintain, that ſhe never loved this <hi>Thamires.</hi> Did ſhe love him? Alas, when? Even when ſhe was not able to love, when her hands and mind were wholly taken up with childiſh Gew-gawes; when her deſires could not reach any higher then to be a little Fine, or to make a Baby, and dreſſe it, and talk to it. Was ſhe not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant what Love was? or if ſhe did at that age love <hi>Thamires,</hi> or thought it to be love; muſt ſhe needs love him ſtill? Alas, alas, ſuch young green affections as that is like our clothes, to be caſt off when we will. Oh! puiſſant god of Love, how ignorant was ſhe, or rather, how did ſhe deſpiſe all thy ſtatutes and ordinances? Is it not by thy Lawes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared a moſt capitall crime, to think, that ones Love ſhall ever end? What then ſhall we think of this ſhepheardeſſe, who could not ſo much as think, becauſe ſhe was uncapable of deſire, but who is really retreated from that love, which ſhe bare unto him, as ſhe her ſelfe told <hi>Thamires?</hi> Can it beſaid, Oh great deity, that ſhe was ever one of thy ſubjects? Wilt thou acknowledge her, or let her enjoy thoſe priviledges which ſhe pretends unto, or ſuffer her to oppoſe me? But if it be ſo, that thy ſuper-abundant goodneſſe, which tranſcends the goodneſſe of all other deities, will allow her to enjoy the benefit of true Lovers, becauſe ſhe flies unto thee for ſanctuary, and may plead, that loving <hi>Thamires</hi> will not love me, no, nor ſo much as look upon me, how can ſhe anſwer this, that ſhe her ſelfe hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, ſhe would not love <hi>Thamires</hi> any longer? With what excuſe can ſhe palliate her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety? And why doſt thou not puniſh this high diſobedience? If thou doſt not, then ſhe is the only one, that deſpiſing, is not puniſhed; and I the only one, who adoring thee, does not finde the reward of thy accuſtomed goodneſſe.</p>
                           <p>I do believe, Oh great Nymph, that <hi>Celidea</hi> being thus accuſed before the Throne of this great deity, ſhe can hardly anſwer, nor avoid being condemned, to give me ſatisfaction for all the paines I have taken, and to render love for love, whilſt <hi>Thamires</hi> cannot oppoſe me with any particular intereſt: For what intereſt can he claim in that, which he hath freely given me? He hath eſtated the whole title upon me, and is ſo far debarred from any right, that he ought in reaſon rather to defend and maintain my title, againſt all men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, ſince it was from him I derived my title. But perhaps he will ſay, that it was his meer free and voluntary act, without any conſideration, but his own love to me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not obliged unto any warrantie. But why, <hi>Thamires,</hi> do you call that a meer vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary act, which you have confeſſed before your Judge, that you were obliged unto it by your promiſes, unto my dying Father, unto whom you were much obliged for ſeverall benevolences? Do you call that a meer free act of your will, which you were conſtrained unto to be quit of ſo many obligations? Do you think you do oblige your Creditors, by paying your due debts? I muſt confeſſe, great Nymph, that <hi>Thamires</hi> hath paid both principall and intereſt, which renders him not to be ungratefull; but I do abſolutely deny, that there was nothing in this act which did oblige his will. But admit it ſo, that it was an act of his own meer free will, and that he did it of himſelfe; did not the effect of this will aime at his own peculiar ſatisfaction? If he do but conſider the debt due unto the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of my Father, and his aime of obliging me by this act, of giving <hi>Celidea</hi> unto me, he will finde, that it was not an act of pure and meer free will, but a way to ſatisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, by paying that debt which was due to my Father, and a way to purchaſe my obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations unto himſelfe; ſo as what he hath done is but a loan, which I muſt perpetually pay intereſt for, and which he may claim as an obligation upon me to pay: If I ſhould ſail in paying my acknowledgments, he might juſtly call me ingrate; but he cannot ſay that he gave me <hi>Celidea</hi> freely, ſince in conſideration of himſelfe, and by the rules of human pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he was obliged unto it, and hath ſo debarred himſelfe, as he is obliged to maintain my claim unto her, againſt any that ſhall hinder me from enjoying her. The god of Love be my witneſſe, Father, (for ſo I will call you as long as I live unleſſe you forbid me) the great god of Love be my witneſſe, I ſay, whether it grieves me not to the very foul, I ſhould oppoſe you in this buſineſſe. You your ſelfe doe know, in what a ſad condition you have ſeen me: You know, how Love had almoſt brought me to my grave, and you muſt needs confeſſe, that it was the power of Love which compelled me to diſpleaſe you; ſuch was the force upon me, that I had no free will unto it at all but was forced by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive neceſſity unto it: Nothing elſe under the Sun could have made me contradict your commands; if there be let the gods puniſh me as the moſt ungratefull perſon that ever breathed. But Father, ſince there was an unreſiſtable force upon me, I beſeech you pardon my weakneſſe, and do not you your ſelfe help me to complain againſt you; for, were not
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:53526:111"/>
you the cauſe of all this? For ſince it was wholly in your diſpoſe, why did you bring me from amongſt the <hi>Boyens</hi> before you had married <hi>Celidea?</hi> Could you think, that being your Kinſman, I ſhould not ſympathize with you, and ſo be in danger to love her as well as you? But perhaps you will ſay, that you thought your command upon me not to love her, was enough to keep me within the bounds of my duty, and make me look upon her onely as my Siſter. But, wiſe <hi>Thamires,</hi> I doe wonder you ſhould not remember the follies of youth; and that it is the nature not onely of all thoſe of that age, but generally of all men whatſoever, to think things that are moſt forbidden to be moſt ſweet: I admire you ſhould forbid me loving her before ever I ſaw her, as if you had a minde to make me love her by the ear, before ſhe was ſeen by the eye. What was this, but to awaken my deſires, and to kindle a fire; like a Flint which is ſtrucken, which before was cold, and had no appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of heate in it.</p>
                           <p>But perhaps again you will ſay, that you did allow me to love her in the degree of a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and ſo limit my deſires as I ſhould neither offend you nor my ſelfe; you in not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining me too much, and me in not confining me too narrowly, but allowing me to keep within your preſcribed limits.</p>
                           <p>But, O great Nymph, conſider, I beſeech you, what kind of command this was: <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires</hi> ſhewes me a beauty of an infinite luſtre, allows me converſe with her; commands me to love her, but will not have my love ſtir one foot beyond his limit, nor love her above the quality of a Brother. Oh heavens! what did he think I was made of? Can Love that thinkes the whole univerſe too narrow a compaſſe to be confined unto, and who diſpoſeth of all our wills according to his pleaſure be hemmed up in ſuch ſtrait limits as hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes? Will Love be ruled and governed by the will of any but himſelfe? But what in the name of Heaven does <hi>Thamires</hi> thinke of me? Does hee conceive that I have more power than either Men or Gods, or the whole World hath? It had been but juſt to have meaſured me by himſelf; and if he could have tamed his own affections and paſſions, then might he have had ſome reaſon to impoſe the like task upon me: But that hee who had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of his own ſtrength, and of Loves power, for him, I ſay to command a thing which he himſelfe could not obſerve, whoſe age and experience had great advantage over my green years, this was too much, too unreaſonable. Perhaps again he wil complain, that I have not payd him ſuch reſpect as is due unto a Father, &amp; that his great indulgency towards me might very well oblige me unto much more than all this. Alaſs, alaſs, does he not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that what I did was done by compulſion; and that I had rather dye than fail in any point of duty to him? The torments I did endure, when I was in the very Arms of death, is a ſufficient teſtimony of all this. The grave Phyſician found it by my Pulſe, and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in my complexion: Let him conſider, that ſuch was my reſpect of him, that I choſe death rather than I would diſcover the cauſe of my Malady. If he will blame any, he muſt blame Nature, for not giving me power to command my Interior motions, as well as my Tongue and exterior actions and parts: Alaſs, I would never have received life from him but on condition that <hi>Celidea</hi> might be mine: I doe confeſſe that never man was more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged unto another than I am to him; I know that never Kinſman received more indulgent kindneſſe from another Kinſman; nor ever any Child greater teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of affection from a Father than I did from <hi>Thamires</hi> when he reſigned <hi>Celidea</hi> unto me: But now at this time, ſince he offers to raviſh her from me, May I not rightly ſay, that never man received greater injury from another? never Coſen more unkindneſs from a Coſen, nor child more tyrannique treatment from a Father, than <hi>Calidon</hi> from <hi>Thami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res?</hi> So as now all my former obligations to him, are cancelled and changed into ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny injuries: For, <hi>Thamires,</hi> though it is true, you had a care of mee in my very cradle, though you have brought me up with all indulgent care; though you have declared mee your Heir, yet for all theſe, if you doe deprive mee of that thing which farre above all the world is moſt dear unto me, and which you your ſelf did give me, doe you not give me a death much worſe than that which you preſerved me from? And if I doe not enjoy that which you would raviſh from me; your eſtate, your education, nay, my life it ſelf is of no value unto me. Conſider, wiſe <hi>Thamires,</hi> that to take back a gift by force, doth more offend him that did receive it, than if being asked it had been denied him; and therefore, wonder not if I ſay that this act hath cancelled all my obligations unto you. Which to prevent, I beſeech you joyn with me, and own what I ſhall ſay unto <hi>Celidea</hi> on your behalf; How is it poſſible, my fair Daughter (would I have you ſay unto her) that <hi>Calidons</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream affection ſhould find no acceptance from you? Will all my perſwaſions and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of him reach no farther than your eares, and have no effectual influence upon
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:53526:112"/>
your ſoul? Have you not often promiſed that I ſhould have the abſolute diſpoſe of you? If it be ſo, why doe you not make good your promiſe? Did I ever propoſe any unto you who was not worthy to be loved? Is he whom I doe now motion unto you ſuch a one, or unknown to you, or without kindred or friends? I beleeve there is not a Shepheardeſſe in all the Country, that would not thinke his amity to be advantageous unto her. The wiſe <hi>Cleontine</hi> thinks it ſo, and ſo does your Mother, though out of an over-fond tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhe will not command you any thing againſt your mind: But perhaps you ſay, that, <hi>Thamires,</hi> it is you only whom I love, and cannot love any other; unto you have I wholly given my ſelf; you have the abſolute power over me, and may do any thing with me but giving me unto another. The heavens doe know, my fair Daughter, how pleaſing this declaration of yours is unto me, and that there is nothing under heaven can be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto me: But if you doe indeed love me, you will endeavour to preſerve my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and love me under the name of <hi>Calidon,</hi> who is my very ſelf, and of my very blood. As for his ſoul, he loves you as I doe, ſo as there is a ſympathy betwixt us: And ſince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt friends, all things are in common, ſo ſince I love him, I have nothing he hath not a ſhare in as well as my ſelf: So as if I have any ſhare in your affection, as you ſay I have, he muſt of neceſſary conſequence be a participant with me. Doe not complain againſt me for this, and ſay, that I break faith with you, and change you for another; for I am fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved never to love any but you; you, you onely were the beginning, and ſhall bee the end of my affection. But ſince Deſtiny forbids me to enjoy you, and conſtrains mee to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath you unto another, both by the Laws of Duty and Nature, I ſhall think it, faire Daughter, an infinite contentment to ſee you his whom I have made choice of, whom I have brought up, whom I love, and whom I have choſen, not onely for my Heir, but alſo for my Companion in all the eſtate which the Heavens and Fortune hath, or for the future ſhall give me. You are obliged unto this by our Friendſhip, as well as I am by my duty. Love therefore my <hi>Calidon,</hi> if ever you loved me, and make it thereby appear, that you are but a Lover, and Religious towards the Gods, who certainly would never have given me liberty to part with you againſt my will, had they not ſo decreed it in their infallible Deſtinies.</p>
                           <p>Great, and wiſe Nymph, this is the language which <hi>Thamires</hi> doth, or ought to uſe, of which I am onely the inſtrument; And which, as I conceive, is ſo juſt, and ſo worthy of himſelf, as I hope he will not diſown it. And therefore, after I have vowed by the great <hi>Tautates,</hi> that <hi>Calidon</hi> doth infinitely love <hi>Celidea,</hi> and that there never was a more faithfull Lover than he, I will uſe no other arguments or reaſons but his own, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring my life, my death, my happineſſe, my miſery, and my All unto your wiſe diſcretion I pray unto the Gods to endue you with all Wiſdom and Juſtice.</p>

                  <hi>Calidon</hi> concluding thus with a low and humble reverence, he went unto <hi>Celidea,</hi> and falling down upon his knees before her, hee waited for her anſwer. <hi>Thamires</hi> he proferred to ſpeak, but <hi>Leonida</hi> told him that <hi>Celidea</hi> was to ſpeak before him, ſince he had already ſpoke unto the matter: So, that Shepheard going againe to his place, <hi>Celidea,</hi> by the Nymphs command, began thus.</p>

                           <p>I Am ſo unaccuſtomed, great Nymph, to ſpeak upon ſuch a ſubject as this, eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo much company, that though I doe bluſh, and expreſs my ſelf with a trembling tongue, yet I hope it will be no prejudice to the juſtice of my cauſe. Were I not moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently aſſured that my reaſons not to love this Shepheard, are in themſelves ſo clear, that they need no manner of artificial dreſſe to illuſtrate them unto you, I durſt not be ſo bold as to open my mouth upon this ſubject: I perceive the eloquence of <hi>Calidon</hi> is much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mine; I want both wit, ſpirit, and eloquence to gloſſe a matter as he can: My words are onely ſimple, and ſutable to my reaſons; which though not many, yet valid enough to make it manifeſt unto you, that ſince I never did love <hi>Calidon,</hi> I ought not to beginne at this inſtant, nor continue that affection which once I had unto <hi>Thamires,</hi> ſince I have ſo many reaſons to the contrary.</p>
                           <p>But where ſhall I begin? What Divine Powers muſt I ask aſſiſtance from, in this dangerous combat? I am aſſaulted, not by Love but by Monſters of Love. A combat ful of danger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſince my wel or ill being depends upon it: And Monſters of Love indeed they are, ſince
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:53526:112"/>
they will make me love by force, and compel me to love and hate according to their wills.</p>
                           <p>I have heard our great and wiſe <hi>Druids</hi> ſay, that <hi>Hercules,</hi> whom we ſee erected upon our Altars, with a Club in his hand, and a Lyons skin upon his ſhoulders, was in his time a great <hi>Hero,</hi> who by his ſtrength and valour quelled Monſters, and was a great Patron of Truth. From whom therefore in this extream neceſſity ſhould I implore aid, ſooner than from this valiant <hi>Hero?</hi> And the rather, becauſe as I have heard, hee loved a Lady of <hi>Gaùle;</hi> and doubtleſſe will for her ſake afford me the aid I implore. To him therefore do I addreſſe my ſelf to ſubdue theſe monſtrous ſpirits, and to furniſh me with ſo much elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and audacity as may make my reaſons apparent unto my Judges. I beſeech thee therefore, by thy valour, O great <hi>Hercules,</hi> and by the fair <hi>Galathea</hi> our Princeſſe, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure thee to deliver me from theſe monſtrous Lovers, and ſo to cleare my reaſons unto this Nymph, that ſhe may give a juſt judgement, and keep me from loving both <hi>Thamires</hi> and <hi>Calidon.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And to begin, what doſt thou mean, <hi>Calidon,</hi> by calling me before the God of Love, whom thou doſt make both thy Judge and thy God? Doſt thou think, that he hath any power over us, who are aſhamed that his Name ſhould be in our mouths, though it do reach our ears? A Maid, <hi>Calidon,</hi> who ever ſcorned to have any thing to do with this Love, is now ſummoned to appear before his Throne to receive her doom: And canſt thou expect I will make any other anſwer, but that let this God of Love doom what he will I will not obey him? But I prethee tell me, when I have obſerved his ſtatutes, and am conſtrained to live according to his will, what recompence may I expect from him? onely this, to be called the moſt amorous Maid in all the Country. A very brave and honourable title indeed for a maid of any quality, and one that deſires to live without a blemiſh upon her honour. Therefore, Oh Shepheard, never ſummon mee before his Tribunal whoſe Power and Juriſdiction I will not acknowledge, and unto whom I doe declare my ſelf to bee an enemy.</p>
                           <p>If you will have me give an anſwer, let us both appeal unto Virtue and Reaſon, and certainly wee need not goe any farther than this great Nymph, who is pleaſed to take ſo much pains to hear our differences. Before her I ſhall anſwer unto any thing you have or can object; which as I conceive may be reduced unto three heads: Firſt, that I ought to love you, becauſe you love me, and becauſe I knew it: Secondly, becauſe the favours which you received from me in your ſickneſs, and which, as you ſay, cauſed your cure, have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged me: And laſtly, becauſe <hi>Thamires</hi> hath given me unto you.</p>
                           <p>But, Madam, that I may give full anſwers unto all theſe objections, I beſeech you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him to anſwer unto my queſtions, that you may come to the knowledge of the Truth out of his own mouth. I ask you, <hi>Calidon,</hi> what allurement did I uſe, to make you in love, the firſt time you begun to love me? When ſhe ſaw he ſtood ſilent, and gave no anſwer, ſhe addreſſed her ſelf unto the Nymph; Madam, ſaid ſhe, I beſeech you command him to anſwer me: And <hi>Leonida</hi> appointing him ſo to doe; You ask me a queſtion ſaid he, which you your ſelf can beſt reſolve; but ſince you will needs have it from my mouth, I will tell you; It was the favour which I received from you, in being pleaſed to ſhew your ſelf unto me at the Sacrifice which was celebrated at the ſixth of the month. Was I the onely woman that aſſiſted at the Sacrifice (ſaid <hi>Celidea)</hi> and were you the only Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of the Town that was there? No, anſwered hee, for almoſt all the Shepheardeſſes and Shepheards of the Town were there alſo. What one act was it, I beſeech you, replyed ſhe, that did attract your affection? In this, anſwered <hi>Calidon,</hi> you muſt acknowledge that my love was the decree of heaven; You did no ſooner turn your eyes towards me, but as ſoon as ever I ſaw you, I loved you, as if I were forced unto it by ſome interior power, which it was impoſſible to reſiſt. But perhaps (ſaid the Shepheardeſſe) when I knew you did love me, did I uſe any art to cheriſh it, or augment it by any freſh favours? No, ſaid he, my affection did beginne without you, continue without you, and augment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you, I mean without your contributing any thing unto it but by being your ſelf. But on the contrary, the firſt time you knew it (for though I did not diſcover it by my words, yet I knew you did perceive it) Oh what harſh treatment did I receive from you? And what extreame diſlike have you ſince ſhewed? So as if I be as you ſay, a Monſter of Love, I am ſo, becauſe it is a thing moſt monſtrous that a Lover ſhould ſo long preſerve his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on maugre ſo many rigorous affronts and cauſes of hatred; for I may ſafely ſay, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of your actions towards me deſerves no other name but of Rigour and Hatred: So
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53526:113"/>
as it is apparent when you came to viſit me in my ſickneſſe, your deſign was to ſave my life, onely that afterwards you might murder me more cruelly. Then <hi>Celidea</hi> replyed thus; You ſee, great and wiſe Nymph, by <hi>Calidons</hi> own mouth, that if hee did love me, it was without any contributing to it by me, unleſſe by being my ſelf; and againſt that, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy can I invent? What would he anſwer if I ſhould ask him theſe queſtions before the Throne of Reaſon and your ſelf: Since Shepheard I never did conſent unto any of your addreſſes, why would you have me participate in your own troubles, ſhame, and errours? Is it not enough that I have all this while endured your importunities without revenge? You doe love me you ſay, and becauſe you love me, I muſt love you again: But pray hear what Reaſon ſaith; You have loved <hi>Celidea,</hi> and in loving her, you have offended her, and what other recompence can you expect from her but hatred? The truth is, Shepheard, that being unwilling to be revenged of you, as in reaſon I might, I contented my ſelf with hating you in my very ſoul, and for <hi>Thamires</hi> his ſake I pardoned the reſt. If you doe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that I doe know of your love by your teares, and by your ſickneſſe: Alaſſe, this does not oblige mee one jot the more to love you, but rather to hate you more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly.</p>
                           <p>Tell me, <hi>Calidon,</hi> ſince <hi>Thamires</hi> hath taken ſo much care to bring you up in literature, and travails, in what part of the world have you ſeen it decent for a young maid as I am, to love, or ſuffer her ſelf to be loved? If it bee not the cuſtome in any place of the world, but where Vice is held for Virtue, doe you not infinitely offend in tempting mee to that which is contrary to my duty? You love me, you ſay, becauſe you cannot chuſe but doe ſo. Good friend, how am I obliged unto you, for doing that, which you cannot chuſe but do? You do excuſe your ſelfe to <hi>Thamires,</hi> for loving me againſt his will, by ſaying, that you are not to blame, becauſe you are forced unto it. Can you think your ſelf exempt from blame, in ſinning by compulſion? and do you think your ſelfe worthy of recompence, for being forced unto a thing, whoſe contrary deſerves a recompence? Either confeſſe your ſelfe culpable towards <hi>Thamires,</hi> or elſe ceaſe ſeeking a recompence for your forced ſervice, But if you do love me againſt my will, am I to be puniſhed for it? Did I ever entreat you to it? did I ever give you any occaſion? You ſay, No. Will your love be any contentment or advantage unto me? Shall I become more fair, more vertuous, or ever the better by it? Oh heavens! <hi>Calidon,</hi> where are your wits? Are you mad, to ask a recompence, where a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is deſerved? Or rather, what an impudent affront is this, before this great Nymph, to demand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

I believe you will ſay, that I ſhould not have flattered you in your errour, nor kept you alive when you were ſick by giving you good language. But, <hi>Calidon,</hi> have I not good cauſe to ſay, you are an ungratefull man and does not acknowledge the good office I did you, in miſconſtruing of it, and taking it in another ſenſe then you ought. Did a guilty perſon ever finde or think his Judge too milde or ſweet? or, did any offendor ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that in lieu of puniſhment, he received favour and courteſy? Becauſe I wiſhed not your death, am I blamable for ſaving your life? You accuſe me for having pitty upon you, and ſhewing favour inſtead of revenge, and would have me puniſhed for it. Judge, Madam, how his underſtanding is out of the way, and how he takes reaſon the wrong way. But Shepheard, neither blame me, nor commend me for my act, ſince according to your own argument, it was an act forced upon me, which ought neither to be recompenſed nor pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. It was my affection to <hi>Thamires,</hi> who conjured me unto it by all the obliging arguments he could deviſe, which induced me unto it. I ſee, <hi>Calidon,</hi> that you do ſmile, that I ſhould ſay, it was my affection unto <hi>Thamires,</hi> which moved me to treat you in that manner, becauſe you conceive, that ſhe who a little before did declare her ſelfe ſuch an enemy to Love, cannot now well ſay, that Love had ſuch an influence upon her ſoul. But Shepheard, you are much miſtaken, if you think, that in being an enemy unto Love, I am ſo alſo unto Amity and friendſhip, or void of that vertue, which makes us think of things as they ought to be. I have heard ſay, great Nymph, that one may love two manner of wayes; the one according to reaſon; the other, according to deſire. That which hath reaſon for its rule, is called vertuous and honeſt Amity; and that which ſuffers it ſelfe to be tranſported with deſire, Love. With the firſt of theſe we do love our Parents, our Kindred, our Friends, our Country, and both in generall and particular, all thoſe in whom any vertue ſhines. As for the other, thoſe that are infected with it, are tranſported and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, as with a frenzy Feavour, and do commit ſo many groſſe faults, that the name of it is as infamous amongſt perſons of honour, as the other is good and laudable.</p>

I ſhall without a bluſh then confeſſe, that I did love <hi>Thamires,</hi> but withall I muſt tell you, it was for his vertue. If <hi>Calidon</hi> do ask me, how I can diſtinguiſh and diſcern between theſe two kinds of affection, ſince the one does commonly appear in the habit of the other? I ſhall anſwer him, that the wiſe <hi>Cleontine</hi> teaching me how to behave my ſelfe in the world, did give me the difference: Daughter, ſaid ſhe, my age hath furniſhed me with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in many things, and hath taught me, that things are the moſt certainly known by their effects; and the better to diſcern after what manner we are loved, conſider the actions of thoſe that love us; if you finde them to be irregular, and contrary to reaſon, vertue, or duty, flie them as diſhonourable; if on the contrary you finde them to be moderate, and not ramping beyond the limits of honeſty or duty, then cheriſh them, and eſteem them as ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. This ſapient leſſon, Shepheard, teacheth me to cheriſh the affection of <hi>Thamires,</hi> and to flie yours: For what effect does the love of <hi>Calidon</hi> produce? Violencies, raptures, tranſports, and deſpairs, were never the effects of vertue. If the love of <hi>Thamires</hi> be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, we ſhall finde it to be all vertue: When did he begin to love me? At a time, when there was no likelyhood any vice could invite him to it. How has he continued this affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? So, as neither duty nor honeſty could take the leaſt exception againſt it. But why did he give over? For the reaſons which he himſelfe hath given. Whether reaſon do not appear in all this, I refer my ſelfe, Madam, unto your judgment. Theſe conſiderations moved me to entertain the affection of <hi>Thamires,</hi> and reject the love of <hi>Calidon.</hi> And this Amity, and nothing elſe, did enforce me to viſit this Shepheard when he was ſick; to give him ſuch good words as might recover him; and all this, as well to ſatisfie <hi>Thamires,</hi> as out of a naturall compaſſion, which all ought to have one unto another. If I did fail in my love to <hi>Thamires, Calidon,</hi> for your ſatisfaction, I will confeſſe it and repent, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, to love <hi>Thamires</hi> no more, nor fall into the like fault. But I cannot believe, that therefore I am obliged to love you; for if I ſhould, it would be to correct one errour by committing another, which is worſe. Perhaps you will alledge againſt my defence, that having given the whole diſpoſition of my ſelfe unto <hi>Thamires,</hi> and he transferring me into your hands, I cannot contradict his diſpoſall of me. This is an excellent concluſion indeed: I chuſe you for my husband preſently after you may give me unto another; this is very fine Logick. You muſt know, <hi>Calidon,</hi> that the reaſon why I gave <hi>Thamires</hi> all the power of my ſelfe, was, becauſe I did love him, and he loved me; and therefore if he have any power over me, he muſt love, that is the implicite condition of his power; but if he do not, then, the cauſe ceaſing, the effect muſt needs ceaſe: and therefore if he do not love me, he hath no power over me. But haply you will reply, that he ſwears he does continue loving me ſtill, and that it is reaſon, not want of affection, which made him transfer me over unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I muſt anſwer both him and you, Shepheard, that I do not believe him; and yet, if reaſon can ſo well perſwade with his affection, why ſhould not reaſon have as much power over my affection? Is there any reaſon I ſhould love him, whom nature and reaſon both forbids me to love? Nature forbids the banes, for ſince the firſt houre I ever ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Believe it, <hi>Calidon,</hi> what I ſay, proceeds not from any ſcorn of you, but from the very truth; I had rather chuſe to reſt in my grave, then live with you: not but I do know and confeſſe, you deſerve a much better fortune; but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe Nature does hold me from you with abundance of violence, and without any cauſe: And ſince it is ſo, upon what pretence can you deſire I ſhould be yours ſince Nature does forbid it, and Reaſon likewiſe, which neverthwarts Nature? Go, go, <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> live in quietneſſe; do not wilfully endeavour to make two perſons miſerable; for the truth is, you will be as miſerable by it as my ſelfe. If you do love me, let it ſuffice, that your love is moſt troubleſome to me, and do not ſtrive to ſurcharge me with an intolerable burthen, by forcing me to love you. And be aſſured of this, that <hi>Lignon</hi> ſhall ſooner run backward, then you ſhall finde any place in the affection of <hi>Celidea.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This, Madam, is the Anſwer, which I ſhall give unto the ſhallow reaſons of <hi>Calidon.</hi> But now, I have another more dangerous enemy to encounter withall, who has better Armes, and who gives more ſmarting blowes: I mean, the ungratefull <hi>Thamires; Thami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> whom I did really love, and whom I thought had loved me as well as any poſſibly could. But alas, what would he have now? Can he expect any thing from her, whom he hath betrayed into the hands of her moſt cruell enemy? Does he yet hope for any love from her, whom he hath moſt ungratefully wronged? Whan colour, and upon what ground can he deſire me to love him? Is it, becauſe he did love me, or becauſe I loved him? This,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:53526:114"/>
Madam, had been ſome reaſon at that time; but now, ſince he has left loving me, and would force me to love another and not himſelf, why does he urge unto me the time paſt, which is not, nor ever will return? The memory of that time is an argument to hate him the more, ſince I do finde him at this preſent ſo unworthy. I do confeſſe I did love him; but, when he reſigned me unto another, he did demonſtratively ſhew, that he neither did nor does love me: And therefore let him not think it ſtrange that ſince my affection did proceed from his mine ſhould ceaſe as well as his; for his was the cauſe, and mine the effect, and the cauſe ceaſing, the effect muſt follow. Why did he cut up a Tree, from which he expected fruit? He hath done me more wrong then I him, ſince he was the firſt offendor, and yet I am ſatisfied, I complain not, I can quit him with a very good will, and cannot wiſh he ſhould court me again, becauſe it is a thing impoſſible to obtain me. What is it he would now have? Does he not know, that as long as our love was mutuall, I was his, and he was mine, and then by the Lawes of Amity he might diſpoſe of me as his own? If he have given me unto <hi>Calidon,</hi> how can he pretend me to be his? If he have any thing to require from me, he muſt addreſſe himſelf to him unto whom he hath given me; if he can have his conſent, I will afterwards conſider what I have to do; if he cannot, why does he complain of me? or ask me, for what he has given away? He hath ſacrificed me, as he ſaith, to <hi>Calidon's</hi> health, manifeſting thereby, that <hi>Calidon</hi> was dearer unto him, than I was, and in very good time: But can he not be contented, that his ſacrifice is accepted, and that his deer <hi>Calidon</hi> is recovered from death? Would he ſo ſacrilegiouſly recall, what he has dedicated unto the gods? Remove, <hi>Thamires,</hi> all ſuch thoughts out of your ſoul, leſt the gods do puniſh you for it; and do not hope, that ſince I have been offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the gods for the health of <hi>Calidon,</hi> I will ever ſtoop ſo low as men again. The truth is, ſince I have been ſo ill treated by the man whom I moſt eſteemed, it would be extream im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence in me, to put my ſelfe into his hands again, who knew not how to make any better uſe of me Perhaps <hi>Thamires</hi> would have me again, that he might ſom other time ſave the life of ſome friend or kinſman; or elſe courts me now, to keep me againſt <hi>Calidon</hi> fall ſick again: But be aſſured, that my own life is much deerer unto me, then his life is unto whom you have given me; and therefore I have all the reaſon in the world to look unto my ſelfe before any other. If I did beſtow ſome tears at thy departure <hi>Thamires,</hi> I will laugh at your return. Oh, how liberall you are, to give away that which is anothers? But, Oh you hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, how juſt you are, ſince when you ſaw me offended by theſe two Shepheards, and knowing my innocency, you would vouchſafe to take me into your protection, and have revenged my quarrell, even by my enemies themſelves. What diſpleaſure does this perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous man receive, even from him unto whom he hath given me? And what torments does this importunate perſecutor of my reſt receive, even from him, who gave him all the right he has to pretend unto me? What leſſe can be expected upon them, than divine vengeance? And I make no queſtion, Madam, but you will ratifie the doom of heaven, and give ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence on my ſide.</p>

                           </head>
                           <p>I Perceive, great Nymph, it happens to me, as unto him that made a ſword for one, who thruſt it into his heart; for I, that educated this Shepheard and Shepheardeſſe with as much indulgent care as was poſſible; I that taught them to ſpeak, and how to live in the world; yet theſe two do wound me to the very heart and ſoul, ſo as I have no hopes left, but in your favourable judgment. It ſeemes, they make me the very Butt of their ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and would have me bear all their own faults; but, though theſe aſperſions do deeply wound me, yet, I had rather be the offended, then the offending party: And truly, I am naturally ſuch a deadly hater of ingratitude, which is the bane of all humane ſociety, that I had rather receive the blow from the hand of another, then give it.</p>
                           <p>Perhaps by acknowledging the faults which you both have committed, you will be aſhamed, and repent of the wrongs you have done me, in requitall of all my indulgency towards you: And then, all your gilded language which you have employed to my ruine, will be a ſhame unto your ſelves, ſince I do ſtill love you both, and ſince my affection is
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:53526:114"/>
yet much above all the injuries you have done me. Now, my children, I doe pardon you, and paſſe by the follies of your youth; but then, I do expect you ſhould confeſſe your faults, and acknowledge my favours, and that you doe confeſſe a leſſe affection than mine, could never pardon ſuch ingratitude. I perceive, Madam, that I doe ſpeake unto deafe ears, and ſpend my advice upon ſtones which hear me not. I have hither to applied the moſt milde medicines, to ſee if ſweetneſſe would cure them, but ſince Lenitives will not doe, Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives muſt; and ſince they continue ſtill obſtinate, I muſt purſue them with Fire and Sword.</p>
                           <p>Theſe are the moſt ſubſtantial reaſons which <hi>Calidon</hi> hath alleadged: You have given <hi>Celidea</hi> unto me, and you are obliged unto it by the confidence which my Father did put in you, by the affection which you profeſſed unto me, and by your hopes of obliging me. And you have offended me much more in offering to take her from me after the gift of her; than if you had at the firſt denyed her unto me: This, great Nymph, is all he hath ſaid with ſuch a huge flouriſh of words, both againſt mee, againſt himſelfe, and againſt reaſon.</p>
                           <p>Ungratefull Shepheard, wilt thou thus trample upon my goodneſs and indulging over thee? You ſay that I did give <hi>Celidea</hi> unto you; and why I beſeech you, did I give her? was it was becauſe I was weary of her, or onely to pleaſe you? No, no, ſay you, it was only to ſave my life. Well then, you muſt confeſſe you owe your life unto me; and are you not extreamly ungratefull in offering to take his life away that preſerved yours? If I did give her unto you onely to ſave your life, what wrong is it to aske her againe, now your life is ſaved, and you well? But haply you will ſay, that though you are recovered, yet it was onely in hopes that <hi>Celidea</hi> ſhould remaine with you; what though you have recovered your health, ſince now you are not in any danger? Courteſie and diſcretion teacheth us, that when in caſes of neceſſity wee make uſe of any thing which is our friends, we ſhould reſtore it with the intereſt of thanks. It ſeems you are very farre from ſo much courteſie and diſcretion, ſince when I gave you ſome hopes of <hi>Celideas</hi> favour, and gave you thereby your life, now you are recovered you would take her and them for your own, and endeavour by gloſing language to cover your ingratitude. But, Madam, perhaps he wil ſay, that if I do take her from him, he ſhall fall into the ſame danger he was before: No, great Nymph, you ſee by experience that now he is aſſured <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidea</hi> will never be his, he onely grows a little more melancholly; but his life is not at all in danger, and therefore to ſave his life being the reaſon of my act, and not the ſatisfying of his pleaſure; ſince his life is ſaved, I may without offence take her back unto my ſelf. But admit his life were at the ſtake, would not my life be the ſame? For ſhould I bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of this fair one, death would be more certain unto me than life. Judge, Madam, I beſeech you, whether I ought not to have a greater care of my ſelf than him. If he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that I ought to yeeld <hi>Celidea</hi> unto him, to ſave his life becauſe his Father loved mee, and recommended him unto me, why does he not as well conceive himſelf obliged to yeeld her unto me, ſince my life is as well concerned, and that upon the very ſame conſideration of amity which his Father profeſſed unto me; Is it not his duty to have as great a care of my life as I had of his? He knows, ungrateful man that he is, I cannot live if I be denyed her, and is he not extreamly ungratefull if he doe deny her unto me? Is hee not unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the title of Son unto him that hath ſo much loved him? Can he think, that becauſe I loved him, therefore I am obliged to part from the thing which is moſt of all the world dear unto me? Is he not unworthy the name of Kinſman, ſince he does not value my life? Nay, may I not diſown him for a Friend, ſince he will not doe the ſame offices for mee in my neceſſity, which I did for him? Nay more; May I not account him the moſt cruel ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my I have, ſince he purſues me againſt all reaſon, with ſuch violent arguments to my very death? The very thought of Ingratitude from ſuch as we have obliged, is ſo extreamly odious unto all, as I cannot poſſibly give punctual anſwers unto every particular inſtance of this Shepheard, who hath ſo extreamly offended me. Give me leave, I beſeech you, Madam, to preſent this offer unto him in a few words; As he ows his life unto mee for yeelding <hi>Celidea</hi> unto him, I will releaſe him of that obligation, ſo he will yeeld her again unto me. And to make it appear that he is out of all danger, he cannot deny but that it is above a month ſince <hi>Celidea</hi> refuſed him: She told him that ſhe would never love him; ſhe let him know that her Mother promiſed not to marry her againſt her conſent, and at the ſame time told him, that heaven and earth ſhould meet before ſhe would contract any affection with him; yet for all this, ye ſee he lives, and ſtrives to take away the life of him
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:53526:115"/>
that did preſerve him. Since he is moſt certainly aſſured that <hi>Celidea</hi> will never be his, is he not the moſt ungratefull perſon in the world, in offering to hinder mee from obtaining her? There is not any hopes for him, and hee would alſo ruin all mine. Should he deſire that another ſhould enjoy this happineſſe before me, the whole world would never know the like Ingratitude. I gave him that which was mine, and hee will not let me have that which is not his: I ſaved his life by depriving my ſelf of that which was moſt deare unto me, and he will refuſe that unto me which never was his. But, great Nymph, all theſe hot diſputes 'twixt him and me, are me-thinks, to no purpoſe, ſince his misfortune, and my too much affection unto him, hath taken from us both, that happineſſe which we are diſputing about. What right can you have unto <hi>Celidea,</hi> ſince ſhe does not love you? You will ſay no other, but from your affection to her, and from my gift. But, Shepheard, what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence can you have from your affection, ſince you ſee ſhe diſdains and refuſeth you? And what can you pretend unto by my gift, ſince I gave you no more than what I had my ſelf to give? Now all the right that I had, depended upon her own will, and if this will be contrary unto mine, what power or right had I in it? Therefore, Shepheard, you can have none, nor make the leaſt ſhaddow of pretence unto any. Now, I beſeech you, let us ſee what right I my ſelf can pretend unto. Oh heavens, how great would it be if there was no <hi>Calidon</hi> in being? An affection begun in the Cradle, ſo long carefully continued; a courtſhip ſo full of pure intentions; an affection ſo violent, and ſo long in poſſeſſion of favours; all theſe would make my cauſe very ſtrong, if <hi>Calidon</hi> were not in the world, or had no eyes, or elſe if he could have guided them according to reaſon.</p>
                           <p>I muſt needs confeſs, fair <hi>Celidea</hi> (and ſo I do with teares in my eyes, and ſorrow in my heart) that you have more reaſon to complain of me than all your words and mine can expreſſe. I acknowledge, that never did any affection receive a greater affront than yours hath by my imprudency; yet who ſhould endure, nay overcome great difficulties, but thoſe who have ſtrength and courage? 'Tis true, I have extreamly wronged you, but may not you make this an occaſion to ſhew how highly you can love, by paſſing by and pardoning ſuch an offence? What teſtimonies of your love have you heretofore promiſed me? What is it which you have not ſaid you would ſurmount for my ſake? I do now ſummon you unto your promiſes, and put you to the Teſt; And what greater teſtimony can you give, then by this occaſion which I now offer unto you? When I did oblige you by my ſervices, by my affection, and by all manner of obſequious obſervancie, you did continue your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto me: But this is no teſtimony of affection, it is rather an acknowledgement of a debt: It had been a right teſtimony of your affection, if you had continued when I did hate you. Fortune would have this occaſion to preſent it ſelf, though I am extreamly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for it, to put you to the tryal of your affection; and as a ſummons to keep your word: I hope you are not like unto thoſe, who vaunt that they doe not fear dangers, yet at the very firſt encounter of an enemy, will ſubmit without reſiſtance. But you objected againſt me, How can you hope, <hi>Thamires,</hi> to gather any fruits from love, ſince you have cut up the Tree? Oh fair <hi>Celidea</hi> let me tell you, I had rather cut away my life than that deare Tree of Love: Nay, though I ſhould offer it, yet it would be impoſſible for me to do it. But admit that I had imprudently cut it up, you know that the Mirtle is the Tree of Love, and why would you have it to be the Cypreſs? The Mirtle is of a nature, that the more it is cut, the more branches it puts forth. Oh that I could ſee this effect in your ſoul, that I might beleeve there is growing in you this Tree of Love, and not a Tree of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                           <p>But admit my fault, in guilting you, to bee ſo great as you make it, muſt my fault make you to commit the like? If you think ſo, then you muſt confeſſe, that you catch at bad examples, and not at good ones, unleſſe, as I doe leave you, ſo you leave me, and when I doe return unto you, you doe return unto me alſo: Otherwiſe, you are more moved with an offence than with a full ſatisfaction for it; and evil hath a greater predominancie in you than good: But this is unworthy of <hi>Celideas</hi> ſoul, which promiſeth all goodneſſe and ſweetneſſe.</p>
                           <p>But you ſay, that ſince I have given you unto <hi>Calidon,</hi> if I would have any thing of you, I muſt ask him. This would puzzle mee to anſwer, if I had not heard you ſay, that it was impoſſible for me to give you unto him. Now the matter is brought to that paſſe, as you muſt be either his or mine: If you will not be mine, becauſe I have imprudently given you away, then <hi>Celidea</hi> you muſt be <hi>Calidons.</hi> Conſider whether this change be pleaſing unto you: If on the contrary, you will not be <hi>Calidons,</hi> then you cannot deny but you muſt be
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:53526:115"/>
mine, ſince having been mine before, and my gift taking no effect, all right in the world is, that the thing given ſhould revert unto the firſt poſſeſſor: And you ought not to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with me for offering you as a Sacrifice for <hi>Calidons</hi> recovery, becauſe Sacrifices which are offered unto the gods, are alwaies of the beſt and moſt precious things we have. Nor doe not think that by continuing to love you afterwards, I doe commit any ſacrilege, nor doe prophane any ſacred or holy thing, ſince we doe all love the gods themſelves: The greateſt command which they doe impoſe upon us mortals, is to Love them. But for Gods ſake doe not ſay that I ask you onely to ſacrifice you again for the recovery of ſome other: For my deſire is onely to have you again for my own ſake. I doe confeſſe my fault, and will not inſiſt upon any other argument or reaſon, but my extream affection; and will not argue with her any where but before the Throne of Love. I doe here proſtrate my ſelf upon my knees, and vow by all eternity, never to riſe as long as I live, unleſſe I be ingratiated into <hi>Celideas</hi> favour again.</p>

               <p>Then the Nymph, ſeeing they had no more to ſay, did riſe up, and taking <hi>Paris, Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and the Shepheardeſſes aſide, did ask their opinions upon this difference: Their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions did much vary, ſome to one ſide, ſome to another: At laſt, and after a long and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious debate, they all returned to their places, and <hi>Leonida</hi> pronounced her ſentence in this manner.</p>

                              <hi>The Judgement of the Nymph</hi> Leonida.</head>
                           <p>THree things doe preſent themſelves unto us, upon the difference betwixt <hi>Celidea, Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires,</hi> and <hi>Calidon:</hi> The firſt, Love: The ſecond, Duty: The third, an Offence. In the firſt, we obſerve, three great Affections; in the ſecond, three great Obligations; in the third, three great Injuries. <hi>Celidea</hi> hath loved <hi>Thamires</hi> from her Cradle, <hi>Thamires</hi> hath loved <hi>Celidea,</hi> though he be elder; and <hi>Calidon</hi> hath loved her from the firſt time hee ever ſaw her. <hi>Celidea</hi> hath been much obliged unto the virtuous affection of <hi>Thamires; Thamires</hi> much obliged unto the memory of <hi>Calidons</hi> Father; and <hi>Calidon</hi> much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged unto the Indulgency of <hi>Thamires.</hi> Again, <hi>Celidea</hi> hath been extreamly offended with <hi>Thamires,</hi> for giving her unto <hi>Calidon; Calidon</hi> no leſſe offended with <hi>Thamires</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidea: Thamires</hi> offended with <hi>Calidon</hi> for refuſing to doe the ſame courteſie he received; And <hi>Celidea</hi> offended with <hi>Calidon</hi> for offering to conſtrain her will, and making her to loſe him whom ſhe did love. All theſe things being long debated, and ſeriouſly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, we conceive, that as thoſe things which Nature produceth, are alwaies more perfect then thoſe that are produced by Art, ſo the Love that comes by a natural inclination, is greater, and more eſtimable than thoſe affections that doe proceed from deſignes or obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Furthermore, thoſe obligations which we receive in our own perſons, being greater than thoſe in the behalf of another; ſo it is certain, that a benefit obligeth more than a memory. An offence which hath any tincture of ingratitude, it is much more hainous than a bare offence without it, and deſerves a greater puniſhment. Now, we do find that the Love of <hi>Thamires</hi> does proceed from a natural inclination; for commonly ſuch loves are reciprocal, and ſo he loving <hi>Celidea,</hi> he was loved again: But ſo is not the love of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidon,</hi> whoſe ſterile affection produceth nothing but hatred and ſcorn. Moreover, the good offices which <hi>Calidon</hi> hath received from <hi>Thamires,</hi> doe render him more obliged, than <hi>Thamires</hi> can be upon the ſcore of an Uncle. Again, <hi>Calidons</hi> offence againſt <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires</hi> having a ſtain of Ingratitude upon it, is much greater than the offence of <hi>Thamires</hi> againſt <hi>Calidon,</hi> ſince <hi>Thamires</hi> may almoſt cover it with the name of Revenge or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſment. Therefore, in the firſt place, we doe ordain that the love of <hi>Calidon</hi> do ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto the love of <hi>Thamires:</hi> That the obligation of <hi>Thamires</hi> be eſteemed leſſe than the obligation of <hi>Calidon;</hi> And the offence of <hi>Calidon</hi> greater than the offence of <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires.</hi> And as for that which concerns <hi>Thamires</hi> and <hi>Celidea,</hi> we do declare, that <hi>Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas</hi> obligation unto <hi>Thamires</hi> is above the offence of <hi>Thamires,</hi> in reſpect of his pure and innocent love; and in reſpect of his carefull and indulgent education of her, ſo as ſhee would be ingrateful if ſhe did not think her ſelf much obliged: 'Tis true, his offence is not ſmall, when in diſadvantage of his affection, he would needs ſatisfie the obligations
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:53526:116"/>
which he thought he owed unto <hi>Calidon.</hi> And yet in conſideration there is no offence but may be pardoned by a perſon that truly loves, we doe ordain, with the advice of all thoſe who have heard the difference, That the Love of <hi>Celidea</hi> ſhall ſurmount the offence which ſhee hath received from <hi>Thamires;</hi> And that the Love which <hi>Thamires</hi> for the future ſhall bear unto her, ſhall ſurpaſſe that affection which hitherto he hath born unto her; for ſuch is our Judgement.</p>

               <p>This was <hi>Leonida</hi>'s Sentence, which hath ſince been obſerved by all three; though the poor <hi>Calidon</hi> received it with ſo much diſguſt, that but for the extream diſdain of <hi>Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> he ſhould hardly have ſupported it. But his malady at this time proved to be his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, when from a more ſound judgement he conſidered how much he was obliged unto <hi>Thamires,</hi> and how great his folly was, in thinking to make <hi>Celidea</hi> love him by force. But at the firſt, theſe conſiderations had not ſo much power upon him, as to cut off all his hopes at one blow: which the Nymph wiſely foreſeeing, and to avoyd the complaints and teares of this Shepheard, as ſoon as ever ſhe had pronounced the laſt word of her Sentence, ſhe did riſe up, being partly invited unto it by the night which came on apace, and ſhe had no more day left than to carry her unto her Uncles houſe. Therefore, after ſhee had ſaluted all the fair Shepheardeſſes, ſhe and <hi>Paris</hi> entreated <hi>Silvander</hi> to conduct them through the Wood of <hi>Bonlieu,</hi> leſt they ſhould loſe their way, it being very late, and too troubleſom for the Shepheardeſſes to accompany her.</p>
               <p>Thus they parted; and preſently after, the Nymph and <hi>Paris</hi> diſmiſſed <hi>Silvander,</hi> and came unto the houſe of <hi>Adamas,</hi> as he was ready to goe unto his ſupper. <hi>Silvander</hi> as he returned, left <hi>Bonleiu</hi> on his left hand, a Temple where many Veſtals, and chaſt Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Druids</hi> doe inhabit, under the charge of the venerable <hi>Chriſante,</hi> and hee went through a Wood ſo thick, that though the Moon was up and ſhined, yet hee could not hit his way. And indeed his own wandring thoughts as well as the darkneſſe of the Wood, did put him beſides his aym: For hee was ſo wholly taken up with <hi>Diana,</hi> that he minded nothing elſe; And walking on, he came at laſt upon an open place, where hee ſaw the Moon, ſhe was a little paſt her Full, and ſhined very clearly. The Shepheard fell down upon his knees, to adore her; and becauſe of the conformity in Names between <hi>Diana</hi> and her, he loved that Starre above all the reſt in the Cope of Heaven. Having thus adored her, and <hi>Diana</hi> in her, hee ſtood up, and fixing his eyes upon her, he uttered theſe Lines.</p>

Oh heavens, (cryed he out then) what then will become of thy <hi>Silvander,</hi> ſince ſhe will not admit of any <hi>Endymion?</hi> Can it poſſibly be, that Nature, who cannot chuſe but be pleaſed with her workmanſhip, ſhould not finde one in all her Treaſury worthy of her? Can ſhe poſſibly beſtow ſo much beauty upon this Shepheardeſſe, and make her incapable of Love? However, they have no eyes; that are not delighted with ſo rare a piece of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency. Does not the gods allow, that as our hearts receive the greateſt blowes, ſo our hearts ſhould reſent the greateſt contentment? Did they make her ſo fair, and not to be loved? Or if we do love her, did they make her to conſume us? Ah! alas, I ſee, that as this beauty was made to be loved ſo it is for her own glory, and for the torment of thoſe who love her as I do. This thought gave him ſuch a ſtop, that he left walking; and after a long agitation of thoughts, he uttered theſe Lines.</p>

               <p>The Moon then, as if purpoſely to invite him to a longer ſtay in that place, did ſeem to lend him a double luſtre. And becauſe he had left his flock with <hi>Diana's,</hi> and aſſured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſhe would out of her curteſy take all requiſite care over it, he reſolved to ſpend part of the night there, according to his uſuall cuſtome; for he took abundance of delight, in entertaining himſelfe with his new thoughts, that retiring from all company, he uſed to get into ſome private valley, or ſome ſolitary wood; and day would oftentimes overtake him, before he began to think of any ſleep, making his long and amorous thoughts ſee both the evening and the morning. Thus at this time did he wander, chuſing that path which by chance his foot did fall into; and after he had fancyed a thouſand Chimera's, he found himſelfe in the midſt of a thick wood, and knew not where he was; and though at every ſtep almoſt he ſtumbled againſt ſomething or other, yet could he not give over his pleaſing thoughts; all that he ſaw, furniſhed his fancy with ſome conceit, and fed his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. If he chanced to ſtumble upon any thing: I found greater rubs (would he ſay) in my deſires. If he heard the leaves ſhake when they were moved by ſome blaſt of winde: I tremble more for fear (would he ſay) when I am by her, and when I would acquaint her with my reall paſſions, which ſhe thinks to be fained. If he look'd up and ſaw the Moon, he would ſay: <hi>The Moon in the heavens, and my</hi> Diana <hi>upon earth.</hi> This ſolitary place, ſilence, and the pleaſing light of the night, cauſed this ſhepheard to walk ſo long with the

                  </gap> by the leaves of trees, and deſiring to get out of that gloomy place, he no ſooner looked about to make choice of a good path, but he heard one not far off talking; and though he made choice of that place for privacy, yet his curioſity invited him to know who thoſe were that paſſed away the night without ſleep, aſſuring himſelfe, that they were ſome that were ſick of his own diſeaſe; and making it appear by this, that every thing lookes for its like, and that curioſity hath a great power in Love, ſince, when he was ſo ſweetly taken up with his own thoughts, that he deſpiſed all the world in compariſon of them, except the ſight of <hi>Diana;</hi> yet was he content to forſake them, to ſee who theſe were; ſo as quitting them for a time, and giving way to his curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, he turned that way from whence he heard the voice. He had not gone above fifteen or twenty paces, but in the moſt obſcure part of the wood, he found himſelfe cloſe by two men, whom he could not poſſibly know, as well by reaſon of the darkneſſe, as becauſe their backs were towards him; yet he knew by their habits, that one of them was a Druide, and the other a Shepheard.</p>
               <p>They were ſet under a Tree, which ſpread its leaves over a chryſtall fountain, whoſe pleaſing murmur invited them to ſpend part of the night in that place. When <hi>Silvander</hi> was moſtdeſirous to know them, he heard one anſwer the other, thus: But, Father, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrange, and I cannot ſufficiently admire it, that you ſhould by your diſcourſe intimate as much, as if it muſt be confeſſed, that there are many other beauties more perfect, then the beauty of my Miſtreſſe; which truly I cannot believe, without an unpardonable of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: For certainly, every one does think his own the faireſt; and to confeſſe ſhe is not, is a crime, both againſt his Miſtreſſe, and againſt Love. Then he heard the Druide anſwer in this manner: My Son, there is no doubt of what I ſay, nor any fear of offending her Beauty, or Love; and I am confident, that I ſhall in a few words make you underſtand it: You know, that all beauty proceeds from that ſoveraign goodneſſe which we call God, it is a Ray of himſelfe, and tranſcends all his other creatures; and as the Sun, which we ſee, does enlighten the Aire, the Water, and the Earth, with the ſame beams; ſo alſo the eternall Sun, does enlighten the angelick Underſtanding, the rationall Soul, and the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But, as the cleerneſſe of the Sun appears more bright in the Air than in the Water, and in the Water then in the earth: ſo the illumination of God appears with greater luſtre in the Angelick Underſtanding, then in the Rationall Soul; and in the Rationall Soul, more then in the Matter. Into the firſt, he hath infuſed Ideas; into the ſecond, Reaſon; and into the laſt, Formes. The Druide would have gone on, had not the ſhepheard interrupted him in this manner: Your diſcourſe, Father, is a little too high, and you do not conſider the capacity of him unto whom you ſpeak; my wit is too dull to ſoar ſo high: But if you will pleaſe to make me underſtand, what the Angelicall Underſtanding is, what the Rationall Soul is, and what the Matter is, of which you ſpeak, perhaps I ſhall underſtand ſomething more. My Son, ſaid the Druide, Angelicall Underſtanding is that pure Intellect, by which they ſee that Soveraign Beauty, and are adorned with all kinde of Ideas. The Rationall Soul is that, by which men are diſtinguiſhed from beaſts; it is it by which we come to the knowledge of things which is called Rationall. The Matter, is that which falls under the Senſes, which is imbelliſhed with divers forms that are given unto them, and by which you may judge, whether ſhe whom you love, has in perfection the two laſt beauties, which we tearm Corporeall and Rationall, and which we may without any offence ſay, that there is in others greater beauties then in hers; which you will underſtand by a compariſon of Bottles, full of water; for, as the greater do hold more then the little ones, and yet the little ones are as full as the greater: ſo it may be ſaid of all things capable of beauty; for there are ſubſtances, which by their perfection of Nature, can receive much more beauty then others, which yet cannot be termed imperfect, becauſe they have as much perfection as they can receive. And under this notion comes the beauty of your Miſtreſſe, whom you may ſay is perfect, and yet without offence confeſſe, that ſhe hath leſſe beauty then theſe pure Intellectualls which I ſpeak of. If you be not too much tranſported with young and imprudent affections, and ſet too great a price upon the beauty of her face, you will ſet your whole affection upon the beauty of her minde, in which you will finde ſomething ſo laſting fair, as will give you as much delight and ſatisfaction, as the beauty of a face gives you ſorrow, and perhaps deſpair. I have heard much diſcourſe upon this ſubject, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Shepheard, but it ſo much diſpleaſed me, that I did not remember it. But I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that one of you Druides endeavoured to prove, that the minde, the eye, and the ear,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53526:117"/>
have only their parts in Love: For, ſaid he, Love is only a deſire of Beauty; and there being three ſorts of Beauties, that of the fight, of which the eye is the only judge; that of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, of which the ear is only capable; and that of reaſon, which the minde can only diſcern, it muſt follow, that the eyes, the ears, and the minde, have only their ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. If any other Senſes do intrude, they reſemble thoſe impudent gueſts, that come unto Marriages before they be invited. Oh Son, ſaid the Druide, this is a Doctrine which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is underſtood by many, but certainly followed by very few; and therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that ſo many vexations and misfortunes do fall out amongſt Lovers. For Love, which moſt certainly is the greateſt, and moſt holy of all the gods, ſeeing himſelfe ſo many waies offended by ſuch as call themſelves his Votaries, either in contemning his ordinances, or prophaning his purity, does very often chaſtiſe them, to the end they may know their faults. For, my Son, what are jealouſies, diſdains, ſlanders, quarrells, infidelities, and all breaches of amity, but puniſhments of that great god? Did our deſires ſtretch no further then diſcourſe, no further then the ſight, nor no further then the ear, why ſhould we ever be jealous? why diſdainfull? why angry? why enemies? why treacherous? and briefly, why ſhould not all love, and be loved, ſince, then, the poſſeſſion of another would not one jot leſſen our happineſſe? Then <hi>Silvander</hi> heard the Shepheard interrupt the Druide with a deep ſigh, in this manner: Alas, Father, how true is your diſcourſe unto all Lovers, but my ſelfe? for my love is full of purity and chaſt deſires, as it cannot offend the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure Veſtall. Let the god of Love be the moſt ſevere of all the gods, yet I am ſure, he can finde no fault with my affection; and yet for all this, never was Lover ſo rigorouſly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as I am. Son, ſaid the Druide, many things do produce different effects, according to the ſubjects they meet withall. A Line which is ſtreight, is not made only to draw another ſtraight Line by, but often to know what is not ſtraight. Thoſe dyſaſters which you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, though in others they are called puniſhments, yet in you, they may be termed teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and proofs of your love and vertue, which will at laſt ſo turn to your advantage, as you may with reaſon ſay, that you had never been happy, unleſſe you had been miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. And in the interim be aſſured, your Miſtreſſe will repent of her fault, and the wrong ſhe does you. After this, becauſe it was very late, he roſe up, with intention to go away, and took the ſhepheard by the hand, who as he followed anſwered thus.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you, Father, and conjure you, by your love unto me, not to ſay my Miſtreſſe is in any fault, much leſſe that ſhe does me wrong; for ſhe having power to diſpoſe of me as much as my ſelfe, you will offend the moſt perfect piece that ever nature produced, and will more diſoblige me by ſuch language, then your aſſiſtance can pleaſe me. <hi>Silvander</hi> hearkened very attentively unto their diſcourſe, and though he did very preciſely obſerve all their actions, yet ſuch was the obſcurity of the place, that he could not know them: and though he thought he knew the Druide, yet, ſeeing only his back, he was not certain. As for the ſhepheard, he was altogether unknown unto him, ſo as he did not remember he ever heard his voice before. This incertainty therfore cauſed him to follow them, hoping for a better diſcovery by the Moon, when they were out of the woods; but keeping at a good diſtance, leſt he ſhould be ſeen by them, he loſt them amongſt the Trees, and never ſince could tell what became of them, which being very ſorry for, he left not his queſt of them untill moſt of the night was ſpent; but wearineſſe at the laſt made him look for a place to reſt in not knowing how to hit the way unto his Town. When <hi>Silvander</hi> was aſleep, he waked not untill the Sun was very high. The Shepheard that diſcourſed with the Druide in the night, was as early as <hi>Aurora;</hi> and the place of his dwelling being very neer, as he was taking his uſuall morning-walk, he eſpied <hi>Silvander</hi> aſleep: He having not been above a month in the Country, and having no acquaintance with any Shepheard, he was very deſirous to know who <hi>Silvander</hi> was, and therefore went very ſoftly to him. He no ſooner ſet his eye upon <hi>Silvander's</hi> face, but he knew him to be his moſt intimate friend; the remembrance of their former acquaintance, and of the pleaſing life they had lived to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, cauſed his eyes to flow in tears: Then retiring back a few paces, and hiding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe behinde a great Tree, leſt if <hi>Silvander</hi> waked, he ſhould ſpie him, he looked upon him very ſeriouſly, and in a low voice uttered theſe words: Oh, my dear friend, and moſt faithfull companion, <hi>Silvander,</hi> how glad, and how ſad both, doth this meeting with thee make me? Our friendſhip, that now ſees thee ſo ſad, will not let me rejoyce at the ſight of thee; and yet the ſight of thee brings into my memory that happy life I lived, ever ſince I was firſt acquainted with thee, untill that fatall ſentence which my Shepheardeſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt me; a ſentence which I cannot remember, but with a ſad heart I muſt needs
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:53526:118"/>
call for death to relieve me, finding experimentally the Proverb to be moſt true, That none are ſo miſerable, as thoſe that have been happy, and now are not. Who is able without a flood of tears to think upon my paſt felicity, and to ſee my preſent miſery? Upon this, he was ſilent; and going further back, becauſe he ſaw <hi>Silvander</hi> ſtir a little, and looking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, ſaid theſe words: Oh faireſt Shepheardeſſe, how cruelly do you treat this poor Shepheard? The ſtranger knew he was aſleep; but not knowing who was the Shepheard that he ſpoke of, he went neerer him; and when he looked him in the face, he found it all tears, which found a paſſage through his eye lids, though they were cloſe. Then did he conclude, that it was himſelfe he ſpoke of, which he thought to be very ſtrange, when he remembered, that his humour was wont to be extreamly averſe unto Love, inſomuch as he was commonly called, The Shepheard without affection: But conſidering what power Beauty hath, he believed that now he was no more exempted from the wounds of Love, than other ſhepheards of his age; and he was the more confirmed in this opinion, when he remembered, that ſome had told him of the wager that was between him and <hi>Phillis.</hi> This conſideration made him look upon him and ſay: Ah <hi>Silvander!</hi> I ſee thou art now far unfit to give any counſel unto others, and for ought I ſee, ſtandſt in need of counſel thy ſelfe My friendſhip cannot chuſe but pray, that Love would be more pitifull unto him, then it hath been unto me, and make him more fortunate then I have been. Then going gently away, he went unto the place where he lodged; and he was no ſooner ſet upon his bed-ſide, but thinking upon his encounter, <hi>Silvander's</hi> affection unto him came into his minde, what great familiarity had been between them, and what fortune it was ſhould bring him into this place. It is, ſaid he, to give a beginning unto a better life, and to put an end unto my torments. Alas that cannot be, for nothing can make me leſſe miſerable then I am, unleſſe it be death. Perhaps the heavens, foreſeeing the end of my daies, condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>Silvander,</hi> my beſt friend, unto me, to bid me my laſt Adien, in the name of himſelf and all the reſt of my friends. This conſideration took up his thoughts a good while, and at laſt made him reſolve upon a thing which never came into his minde before, which was, to write unto his Miſtreſſe; for her ſevere baniſhment of him had ſo damped his ſpirit, that he durſt not aſſume ſo much boldneſſe: But now verily believing, that his courſe of life was neer an end, he conceived himſelfe obliged to take his leave of her in ſome ſort or other, before he went out of the world. Then he took pen and inke, and writ a Letter, and after he had folded it up, he ſuperſcribed it, <hi>Unto the faireſt, and moſt loved Shepheardeſſe in the whole Univerſe.</hi> Then he went unto the place where he left <hi>Silvander,</hi> and going gently to him, after he had kiſſed the Letter two or three times, he put it into his hand: Oh happy Paper (ſaid he) if thy good Fate do bring thee into the hands of her, upon whom all my contentment depends, touch her to the heart; and if thou canſt not move her to any pitty, yet force her to believe, that though ſhe be changed from me, yet my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhall ever be the ſame to her. And thou <hi>Silvander</hi> (ſaid he, putting the Letter into his hand) if love will yet give thee leave to look upon the beauty of her, unto whom this Letter is directed, give it unto her: Good ſhepheard, I beſeech thee do this good office for thy friend, as the laſt that he can hope to receive from thee or any elſe Then this ſhepheard went away with folded armes, and dejected eyes, untill he came to his lodging. Preſently after, <hi>Silvander</hi> awaked; and becauſe he ſaw the Sun of a great height, he looked about which way he ſhould take homeward; and rubbing his eyes after his ſleep, he made uſe of that hand in which the Letter was; he wondred extreamly when he ſaw it, but much more, when he read unto whom it was directed. Do I ſleep, (ſaid he) or do I wake? Is it a dream, or is this a Letter which I ſee? Then looking well upon it: No, no, ſaid he, I do not ſleep, but I have a Letter in my hand, which is directed unto the Faireſt, and moſt loved ſhepheardeſſe in the whole Univerſe. But, if I be not aſleep, why am I ignorant who gave it unto me? Had I it before I fell aſleep? No, no, I had it not. It muſt of neceſſity be, that ſome did put it into my hand when I was aſleep: This may very well be, for there is not one of all the gods that has not loved the beauties of the earth; the god of Love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who wounds others, has not been exempted; ſo as it ſeemes, they think our ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſes more fair then their goddeſſes. Why ſhould I not think, that ſome of theſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalls, or ſome Faun, or Demi-god, having ſeen my fair <hi>Diana,</hi> is fallen in love with her? Then conſidering a little with himſelfe: But, ſaid he, who is it unto whom this Letter is ſent? Let us ſee, certainly it will tell us. Then unfolding the paper, he read it from the beginning to the ending; but, when he found the concluſion of the Letter to be thus ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, <hi>The moſt unfortunate, yet, the moſt faithfull of your ſervants:</hi> Oh! cried he, there
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:53526:118"/>
is no doubt to be made, but it is my ſelfe who writ this Letter: It muſt of neceſſity be, that my good Angell that has a care of my life, having read the thoughts of my ſoul, has wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them in this paper, that I might ſhew them unto <hi>Diana.</hi> The very truth is, there is not any beauty that can cauſe ſuch violent paſſions, as this which I do read, unleſſe the beauty of my Miſtreſſe; no Lover is able to conceive ſo much affection, unleſſe it be <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander:</hi> So as there is no doubt to be made, but that this Letter being directed, Unto the faireſt, and moſt loved ſhepheardeſſe in the Univerſe, I ought to give it unto <hi>Diana;</hi> and being written, by the moſt faithful and unfortunate ſhepheard, it muſt be <hi>Silvander.</hi> Thus <hi>Silvander</hi> went away in a perſwaſion, that this Letter was directed unto <hi>Diana;</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring ſhe ſhould ſee it, after humble thanks given unto his kinde Angel, from whom he had received this good office, he went that way which he thought the ſhorteſt cut unto his Town, with a deſign, that if he did not meet her, to go in queſt of her aſſoon as he had dined; ſo as not meeting her, he diſpatched his repaſt aſſoon as poſſibly he could, hee let forth his flock out of the fold, which had too long waited for him, and took the path that conducts to the Fountain of <hi>Siccanours,</hi> hoping there to heare of her; and he was not deceived in his hopes, for as ſoon as he entered into the meadow adjoyning to it, he ſaw her ſitting under a thick buſh with <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> Love ſwell'd him immediately with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to hear their diſcourſe unſeen, ſince they ſeemed to be very ſerious at their work; and in order to this deſign, he crept from Tree to Tree, and from Buſh to Buſh, till he got ſo neer them unperceived, that he could hear what they ſaid, having left his flock a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him in the wood, under the tuition of his Dog. In the mean time, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> talked thus unto <hi>Diana:</hi> Certainly <hi>Phillis</hi> does not deſerve ſo much favour from you; and I muſt confeſſe, that I am a little jealous of her, though I have laid no wager with her, as <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander</hi> hath; for I would not have her, or any elſe in the world, have a greater ſhare in your favour then my ſelfe. Fair <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> it belongs unto me to beg the favour of your affection, which I do with abundance of zeal, ſo as in this I will not yield unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> of whom you ſpeak. Deareſt Siſter, replyed <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> your merits do ſo much tranſcend all others, as they do render you much above the common rate of Love. But, how comes it to paſſe, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> I ſhould be ſo long with you, before I could obtain this happineſſe? I muſt needs confeſſe, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that I was either blinde, if I had been with you ſo long, and not loved you; or elſe I muſt confeſſe, we are not Miſtreſſes of our own wills, but that there is ſome ſupream power which diſpoſeth of us all as it pleaſeth: <hi>Diana</hi> bluſhed at theſe words, and ſweetly caſting down her eyes, anſwered her: Your language, dear Siſter, would put me to the bluſh, if I were not wholly devoted to be yours; but this will, which you mention, makes me take all that comes from you for favours, though if they ſhould come from any other, I ſhould eſteem them no better then moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keries. If you ſhould take my expreſſions in that ſenſe, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> you would injure that affection which I do bear unto you, and that which you have promiſed unto me. This mutuall affection, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> is too holy and too ſacred to be injured; and therefore to obey you, and pleaſe my ſelfe, I will believe, that your expreſſions are commendations of me, which does proceed not ſo much from truth, as from your affection to me, which makes things ſeem to be greater, then truly they are, and caſts a miſt before your eyes. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, dear Siſter, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> you hold me for one of a very weak judgment, you will believe, that they do proceed both from truth, and from my affection alſo. As for truth, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> I do ſet a high eſtimation upon it; and as for your affection, I do deſire it above any thing upon earth. Upon theſe words, they both embraced and kiſſed each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with abundance of zealous affection; which <hi>Silvander</hi> ſeeing, he wiſhed himſelfe <hi>Aſtrea</hi> a hundred times, that he might have received the like favours. After this, they ſet themſelves down again, and falling unto their work again, he thought that he heard them name him; and therefore, that he might hear the better, he crept neerer unto them, and ſaw, that his Miſtreſſe was making a bracelet of her hair. When he was beginning to be jealous, leſt any but himſelfe ſhould wear it, he heard <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſay: <hi>Silvander</hi> would be very jealous, if he ſaw his enemy in greater favour than himſelfe. I do believe, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> that ſhe did ask it of me with that deſigne. I do think ſo alſo, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> but you do wrong the ſhepheard in it, if you do favour the one more than the other; you are not as good as your word, becauſe you have promiſed the contrary. The advantage which I ſeem to confer upon <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> nor the wager it ſelfe, is not of any great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; beſides, the ſhepheard did never requeſt me for it, as ſhe did. But I do beſeech you, (ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> ſhewing himſelfe unawares) if he do requeſt one, I hope you will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:53526:119"/>
to beſtow it. The ſhepheardeſſes hearing him ſpeak, were much amazed; and their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was ſo great, as they were a long time before they ſpake one word, only gazed upon one another, fearing he had heard the diſcourſe they had a little before he came.</p>
               <p>At laſt, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> began to ſpeak, and told him thus: Fie, <hi>Silvander,</hi> I wonder your diſcretion ſhould be no more, then to harken unto the ſecrets of others. Do you ſo little reſpect your Miſtreſſe, as to ſteal a hearing, when ſhe would not have any hear but me? I do not know what ſecrets you mean (anſwered <hi>Silvander)</hi> but I am ſure, that the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity which invited me hither, was, only to hear my own ſecrets from the mouth of my faireſt Miſtreſſe; it is from her that I muſt be informed and I am very ſorry I came no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſince all that I heard informes me no further, then concerning a Bracelet, which, with much injuſtice, is intended for <hi>Phillis.</hi> You need not be ſorry, ſhepheard, (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea)</hi> for comming no ſooner, ſince if you had, your crime, in offering thus to ſteal the ſecrets of your Miſtreſſe, had been no leſſe then his, that ſtole fire from heaven; and in reaſon, you could not expect a more milde chaſtiſement.</p>
               <p>Oh! anſwered <hi>Silvander,</hi> it is not any fear of puniſhment which can give a ſtop unto my juſt curioſity; for I do ſo much eſteem the means of rendring her proofes of my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as all manner of puniſhments are ſweet unto me, upon that account. Good <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi> unto him) how can you think to give her any teſtimonies of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction this way? I will tell you, fair ſhepheardeſſe, (ſaid <hi>Silvander)</hi> ſhould I not render her a moſt infallible teſtimony, if knowing what ſhe deſires ſhould be ſecret, I ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it? For we now live in an age, when every one does not only tell all they know, but all that they do imagine. In ſo doing, ſhepheard, (anſwered <hi>Aſtrea)</hi> you do make your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion appear. But more affection, ſaid he. As for diſcretion, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I will allow it; but as for affection, I will refer my ſelfe unto her, to whom it is addreſſed. I will make anſwer for her, ſaid he. Would you have <hi>Silvander,</hi> who heretofore was a declared enemy to Love, yet now muſt love and adore; would you, I ſay, have him make his love known? But how comes it to paſſe, fair Miſtreſſe, (ſaid he, and addreſſed himſelfe unto <hi>Diana)</hi> that you would not anſwer unto what I ſay, but ſeemes, as if my diſcourſe did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern you? Perhaps the reaſon is, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> becauſe I muſt not be your Miſtreſſe above fourteen or fifteen daies. If that do trouble you, ſaid he, you may eaſily finde a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, by obliging me by your favours to continue in your ſervice, as your beauty and perfections have hitherto moſt really conſtrained me.</p>
               <p>Ah <hi>Silvander,</hi> anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> let us talk no more of any favours and ſervice, ſince the terme of three Months preſcribed for your faigned affection, is almoſt paſt; it would be too great a trouble to you, to conſtrain your naturall inclination any longer.</p>
               <p>Faireſt ſhepheardeſſe, anſwered <hi>Silvander,</hi> I would not have you believe I do think your ſervice any trouble; but I'le aſſure you, that it is abundance of delight unto me, to do any ſervice upto a perſon of ſo great a merit; inſomuch, as though my Nature were contrary unto Love more then it is, yet ſhould I with abundance of delight, continue in ſuch a ſervice.</p>
               <p>Although, ſhepheard, you ſhould (ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> and ſmiled) yet it is agreed upon but by one party; for though your naturall Genius do incline that way, yet, you can never hope, that I will. Theſe words did touch <hi>Silvander's</hi> heart ſo to the quick, ſince he perceived by them, that he had gained a ſmall influence upon her good-will, as he was not able to hide his ſad reſentments of them; but his countenance did plainly diſcover them by chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging colour: Which <hi>Aſtrea</hi> perceiving: How now, <hi>Silvander,</hi> ſaid ſhe unto him, what! does your heart fail you? It were ſtrange, replyed he, if ſuch cruell language from my Miſtreſſe, ſhould not extreamly trouble me; yet, do not think my heart ſhall ever fail me, though ſhe and the heavens have the diſpoſure of all my hopes and life. Is not this, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> rather raſhneſſe in you, then courage? and are you not too preſumptuous, in denying ſuch powers? No, replied the ſhepheard, it is a moſt true, reall, perfect, and moſt faithfull love which makes me ſpeak ſo. By theſe and the like expreſſions, <hi>Diana</hi> perceived, that <hi>Silvander</hi> did really love her. <hi>Silvander,</hi> he did foreſee abundance of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and very ſmall hopes unto himſelfe. And <hi>Aſtrea</hi> did conceive, that Love had laid a foundation of an exquiſite and laſting affection. And though they all three had different thoughts, yet were they all true, as afterwards you ſhall perceive. But <hi>Silvander</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the ſubject of this diſcourſe, addreſſed himſelfe unto <hi>Diana:</hi> I hope, faireſt Miſtreſſe, ſaid he, that this Bracelet of your fair hair, which you have made for <hi>Phillis,</hi> is only to be rid of her importunities; and if it be ſo, you are obliged to favour <hi>Silvander</hi>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:53526:119"/>
as much as her; and leſt you ſhould be taxed with partiality, you ought to treat us both with equall favour, though the affection which you have cauſed in my ſoul, cannot be equall'd by any other. And why not, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> taking the part of <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſince both sour affections do proceed from the ſame cauſe; one grain of corn produceth ſeverall ears: Allthough the cauſe of our affections be the ſame, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> yet the effects may be different. But experience ſhewes the contrary, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> for the affection of <hi>Phillis</hi> hath obtained that favour, which is denyed yours. This is not: or want of any love, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the ſhepheard, but for want of good fortune: yet, ſince the dropping of water upon the hardeſt Marble, will, in continuance of time, pierce it; why may not I as well hope, that my Love and fervency of prayers long continued, may as well work upon the marble heart of this fair one? Then, after he had looked upon her, or rather adored her a long while, be fell down upon his knees: If Love, my faireſt Miſtreſſe ſaid he unto her have any influence upon beauty, and if prayers cauſed thunderbolts to fall out of the band of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> how is it poſſible, that the extream affection of <hi>Silvander,</hi> and his moſt zealous ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications cannot obtain as much favour, as the ſhallow affection and troubleſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of <hi>Phillis</hi> hath obtained from you? If it cannot, I may with as much reaſon ſay, that the way to obtain love is not to love; and the way to overcome an obdurate heart, is not, by prayers and earneſt ſupplications; but only by diſſimulation, and vexing importunities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Silvander</hi> uſed many other ſuch expreſſions as theſe, by which the ſhepheardeſſe ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered more aſſurance, that love had taken root in him. And <hi>Aſtrea</hi> knowing <hi>Diana's</hi> minde not to be very averſe, from granting <hi>Silvander</hi> what he asked, would needs oblige them both by one act; and therefore joyned her prayers unto <hi>Silvander's,</hi> and ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed ſo with <hi>Diana,</hi> that the Bracelet which was intended for <hi>Phillis,</hi> was beſtowed upon this Shepheard; yet, upon a condition, that he ſhould keep it no longer, then the end of the terme which he was to ſerve her, which ſhe meant was to end within a few dayes; which the ſhepheard with ſome difficulty aſſented unto; but remembring, that though the time of his faigned ſervice would ſoon expire, yet he remembred alſo: that the time which he was to ſerve her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> earneſt, would laſt as long as his life. It is impoſſible to expreſſe the thankfulneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Silvander's</hi> ſoul, but much more his ſatisfied reſentments: Let it ſuffice, that he, who heretofore was wont to deſpiſe all manner of favours from Love, and who could not imagine any could finde any contentment in ſuch follies (as he called them) that he does now confeſſe, that there is no felicity comparable unto this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour which he now reſented. And when he was in the midſt of his ſweet imaginations, it ſeemes, Love had a minde to compleat his joyes, in making the ſhepheardeſſe <hi>Phillis</hi> to enter: For he, whoſe happineſſe is unknown to any but himſelfe, cannot be ſaid to be compleatly happy; but the more it is known, the more happy he is, and much the more, when this happineſſe does not come by Fortune, but by Merit. Aſſoon as <hi>Silvander</hi> ſaw her, he ran unto her, and in a moſt jocund manner, ſhewed her the arme, on which he had already put his moſt beloved Bracelet, and paſſed it often before her eyes, ſaying: Here, <hi>Phillis,</hi> here is the earneſt of my enſuing Victory. <hi>Phillis,</hi> who had been ſeeking <hi>Lycidas,</hi> with a deſire to convince him of his jealouſie, and could not finde him, was ſo ſad and ſo weary, as ſhe needed not to counterfeit any anger, nor change any countenance to teſtifie her diſpleaſure and ſorrowes, which this favour might have cauſed in her. And becauſe <hi>Silvander</hi> was very troubleſome unto her, not only in this Act, but in being the bellowes, which did blow up the jealouſie of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> ſhe ſaid unto him in as ſharp a manner as ſhe could: This earneſt, ſhepheard, which you ſhew me, is rather an argument of your little merit, then of any enſuing victory; for ſo it is uſuall to do, only to make all even. What do you mean by that, ſaid the ſhepheard? I mean, replyed ſhe, that on that end which is too leight, they uſe to put ſome weight to counterpoiſe it, untill the journey be ended; but when they are arrived there, then they throw away that which was only to make an equall ballance. So till we are arrived at the end of our terme, <hi>Diana</hi> does wiſely ballance that ſide which is the leighter, by her favours; but afterwards, ſhe will give her judgment without any regard unto the weight of my affection, or the levity of your little love: And then, God knowes on whom the victory you ſpeak of will fall. <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander</hi> ſmiled, and anſwered: It is rather the cuſtome of miſerable people to be envious, and leſſen the happineſſe of others, which they infinitely eſteem by their language.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phillis,</hi> without any further reply, left him, and went unto the two ſhepheardeſſes, and was extreamly offended at them: And becauſe <hi>Diana</hi> laid the fault upon <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:53526:120"/>
                  <hi>Aſtrea</hi> could not well excuſe her ſelfe, <hi>Silvander</hi> began to ſpeak for them both, addreſſing himſelfe unto <hi>Diana:</hi> I beſeech you, faireſt Miſtreſſe, ſaid he, conſider how prudent Love is, and how wiſely he governes the actions of thoſe he is pleaſed withall. You thought hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that <hi>Phillis</hi> loved you, and indeed I know none, but have in ſome ſort been deceived by her diſſimulations. Love, who knowes all the interiour faculties of the ſoul, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to undeceive you, hath cauſed you to favour me with this Bracelet of your hair, not onely as a mark of my affection, but alſo to diſcover the hollow affection of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luder by her jealouſie: For as it is a thing impoſſible, that two contraries ſhould be at the ſame time in one place; ſo much more, that love and jealouſie ſhould be at the ſame time in one and the ſame heart. <hi>Silvander's</hi> aim was, only to torment <hi>Phillis</hi> the more; for knowing how jealous <hi>Lycidas</hi> was, he doubted not but to trouble her, by propoſing, that Love and Jealouſy are inconſiſtent: And ſhe being touched to the quick could not chuſe but anſwer him thus: Pray, Shepheard, what reaſons and arguments have you to maintain ſo bad an opinion? Such, ſaid he, as will make you confeſſe your ſelfe of the ſame; at the leaſt, if you know what the reaſon is. Love is nothing but a deſire and every deſire is hot: Jealouſie is nothing but a fear, and all fear is as cold as ice; and how can you imagine ſuch a cold Child ſhould be the iſſue of ſuch a hot Parent? We ſee, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> that flint, which is cold, will ſend ſorth ſparks that are hot. Moſt true, anſwered <hi>Silvander;</hi> but fire never produceth cold. Yet by your favour, replied <hi>Phillis</hi> aſhes, that are cold, do proceed from fire. Yes, anſwered the ſhepheard but when the aſhes are cold, the fire is not in them. <hi>Phillis</hi> was almoſt non-pluſt at this reply; and much more, when <hi>Diana</hi> ſpoke. So likewiſe, ſaid ſhe, when cold jealouſie begins, Love, that is hot ends. Miſtreſſe, replyed <hi>Phillis,</hi> my enemy may well get the victory, if he have ſo good a Second as your ſelfe. Then turning her ſelfe towards <hi>Aſtrea:</hi> And you, fair ſhepheardeſſe, ſaid ſhe I may juſtly think you a very ill friend, if ſeeing me aſſaulted by two, you will not take my part. <hi>Aſtrea</hi> anſwered very ſadly: I do hold it for a thing ſo certainly true, that jealouſy may proceed from love, as not to bring it into any doubt. I will not diſpute it, leſt I ſhould be forced to confeſs, that I my ſelfe did not love, becauſe I was jealous as I do ſee you are forced to confeſs, that being jealous of <hi>Diana,</hi> you do not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> her; or at the leaſt, being in doubt whether jealouſie may proceed from love, you are not well aſsured whether you love her or no. I do kiſs the hand of this fair and juſt ſhepheardeſs, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> who, without reſpect of perſons, ſpeaks with ſo much truth in my advantage. If you be obliged unto me, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> then ſurely you do think, that I did ſpeak partially in your favour; for none are beholding unto him that ſpeaks truth, more then to him that payes a debt juſtly due. Moſt true, anſwered <hi>Silvander,</hi> if it be taken in the rigour of juſtice but we do live in an age, wherein ſo few do follow vertue ſimply and cleerly, as we may think our ſelves obliged unto thoſe, that will but acknowledge any benefit, although they are obliged unto it. But what can you argue againſt that experience which we daily finde, ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi> unto him? For I know a ſhepheard, who after he had loved long, and fell into extream jealouſie: yet afterwards recovering out of it, did continue his affection long after: Can you ſay, that this was a fire extinguiſhed, which produced theſe aſhes? It is not impoſſible, (anſwered <hi>Silvander)</hi> but one that is well may fall ſick, and after that ſickneſs, grow well again; nor, that a fire may be put out, and afterwards kindled again. Affection that was long hot, may be put out by cold jealouſie, and that jealouſie being gone, it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as hot as ever it was before: But it cannot be, that health and ſickneſs, hot fire and cold aſhes, love and jealouſie, ſhould be in the ſame ſubject at the ſame time. And for a full clearing of this truth, let us obſerve the effects of love and jealouſie, and by them judge, whether the cauſes from whence they proceed, have any conformity together. The effects of Love is an extream deſire in our ſoules, to ſee the perſon loved, to ſerve her, and to pleaſe her, as much as poſſibly we can. The effects of jealouſie, is a fear to meet her whom we love, a careleſsneſs to pleaſe her, and a diſdaining to ſerve her: And who can think ſuch contrary effects can proceed from one and the ſame cauſe? If we do, we muſt confeſs, that nature will deſtroy her ſelfe, if ſhe will have contraries to conſiſt together. <hi>Phillis</hi> would gladly have anſwered, but ſhe was ſo non-pluſt, as ſhe knew not where to begin; at which <hi>Diana</hi> could not chuſe but laugh, eſpecially when ſhe conſidered the jealouſie of <hi>Lycidas.</hi> And to add more matter for her perplexities, ſhe did purpoſely ſpeak in this manner: Jealouſie is a ſigne of love, as old ruines are ſignes of ancient buildings, which are the greater, the more magnificent the Edifice was: And therefore, a great jealouſie cannot proceed from a little love. But, as we cannot give the name of buildings unto theſe ruines,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:53526:120"/>
ſo jealouſy cannot be called love. And if I may judge by my own humour, if I did love, I ſhould not have power to be jealous. And what would you be, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> if he whom you ſhould love, ſhould love another? His enemy, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> I would ſay, hate him: And though I do foreſee that ſuch an accident would diſpleaſe me, yet, it would be more, for being deceived ſo long, then for being ſo ſoon forgotten. But, if that ſhepheard ſhould be jealous of you, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> what then would you do? I would uſe him ſo, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> that he ſhould never love me again. But ſuppoſe you ſhould deſire he ſhould love you, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> what way would you take? The way of a Precipice, anſwered <hi>Diana;</hi> for I ſhould then think my ſelfe worthy to end miſerably, if I ſhould love one, whom I knew did not love me. Oh! <hi>Diana,</hi> ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> how freely you ſpeak? Nay, <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> how paſſionately you diſpute? If you have need of a remedy againſt this malady, either take that which I would give you, or arme your ſelfe with patience to endure any diſpleaſure that can befall you, and be aſſured, the number of them will not be a few.</p>
               <p>Thus theſe fair and diſcreet Shepheardeſſes diſcourſed with <hi>Silvander,</hi> And becauſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrea</hi> thought that if it continued any longer, it might breed ſome diſtaſte, ſhe had a mind to interrupt them; therefore ſhe roſe up, and ſeemed very deſirous to walk, ſo as taking <hi>Diana</hi> by one hand, and <hi>Phillis</hi> by the other, ſhe motioned to walk, ſaying, they had been ſitting too long. Then <hi>Silvander</hi> as he was officious in waiting about his Miſtris he ſcattered the Letter which was put into his hand in the Night time: and <hi>Phillis</hi> having ſtill her eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, It ſell no ſooner upon the ground, but ſhe took it up, hee not perceiving her; and carrying it unto <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> would needs read it before ſhe would reſtore it to him again. But as ſoon as ever ſhe and the ſad Shepheardeſſe did caſt their eyes upon it, they conceived it to be the hand of <hi>Celadon.</hi> This apprehenſion did touch <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſo to the heart, that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Diana</hi> with <hi>Silvander,</hi> and taking <hi>Phillis</hi> aſide, ſhe was conſtrained to ſit down upon the ground. <hi>Phillis</hi> ſeeing her countenance much changed asked her how ſhe did, and what was the cauſe of her ſo ſuddain alteration? Oh my good Siſter, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> what a ſtrange trembling hath ſurpriſed me? and what a perplexity hath the ſight of this Letter put me into? Did you not obſerve how every Character does reſemble the writing of my poor <hi>Celadon?</hi> Suppoſe it be (ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> who deſired not that <hi>Silvander</hi> ſhould take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of her diſorder) why ſhould you wonder ſo at it? Perhaps it is one of his Letters which Love will reſtore unto you by the hand of <hi>Silvander,</hi> as being moſt due unto you. Alaſſe, my dear Siſter, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> me-thought I ſaw him this very laſt night ſo ſad, and ſo pale, that I ſtarted, and ſo awaked out of my ſad Dream: She would have gone on, when <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Silvander</hi> came unto them, very ſorry to ſee her face ſo much and ſo ſoon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. But <hi>Phillis,</hi> who would by all meanes hide this ſurpriſe from that Shepheard, did make a ſign unto <hi>Diana,</hi> and then addreſſing her ſelf unto <hi>Silvander,</hi> Shepheard, ſaid ſhe, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> hath a very great deſire to impart her minde freely unto <hi>Diana,</hi> if you were not preſent. Oh my enemy, anſwered he, our hatred is not ſo great as to make me uncivil un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Aſtrea:</hi> I know it is not fit that Shepheards ſhould heare all the ſecrets of Shephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes, and therefore I will retire into the next Grove, and wait there untill you call me. And ſo making an humble reverence unto <hi>Diana,</hi> he went into the Wood. And not to bee idle, he took his knife, and began to cut Letters upon the barks of trees. In the mean time, <hi>Diana</hi> underſtood from <hi>Phillis,</hi> how the ſight of a Letter, which fell from <hi>Silvander,</hi> and ſeemed to be the hand of <hi>Celadon,</hi> had troubled <hi>Aſtrea:</hi> Then ſhewing it unto her, and ſhe looking upon it a long time very ſeriouſly; It would be very welcome news which <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander</hi> hath brought, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> if it was <hi>Celadon</hi> that writ this Letter; for moſt certainly it is very newly written, it is ſo freſh, as if it were written this very hour; ſo as if this be <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladons</hi> hand, be aſſured he is not dead: But let us ſee what is within, perhaps we ſhall learn more in it. Then opening the Letter, they found theſe words.</p>

               <p>Ah my dear Siſter, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> It is <hi>Celadon</hi> who writ thoſe words: I know it by his ſtyle and manner of writing; but perhaps it is long ſince it was written. It beares no date (anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> who held it in her hand) but I ſee by the writing that it is very freſh; you may ſee the duſt how it ſticks upon the Ink ſtill, as if it were newly caſt upon it. Siſter, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> there is no better way, if it bee diſcreetly carried, than to know from <hi>Silvander</hi> the place where he found it, or who gave it unto him. Siſter, ſaid <hi>Diana</hi> unto the ſad Shepheardeſſe, if you can but hold your countenance, that he may not ſee the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in it, I am confident we ſhal learn all from him. And becauſe it will be difficult to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect your ſelfe upon a ſudden, I will goe my ſelfe and talke with him, and you may follow after me. So ſhee went unto <hi>Silvander,</hi> whom ſhe found engraving <hi>Anacroſticks</hi> upon the Names of his Miſtreſſe and himſelf, upon the firſt tree he found. But before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to work in bark, he had engraven upon a ſoft ſtone at the Root of a Tree, a Dial, whoſe trembling Needle was turned towards the North, with this Motto, <hi>I am touched;</hi> ſignifying thereby, that even as the Needle of a Dial being touched with an Adamant, does alwayes turn that way, becauſe, as ſome Philoſophers hold, the Element of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone is there and by a puiſſant and natural ſympathy doth attract every part of it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it ſelfe; ſo his heart, being touched with the beauty of his Miſtreſſe, doth turne it and all its thoughts towards her: And the better to explain his conception, hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded theſe Verſes.</p>

               <p>When ſhe was come unto him, he had juſt finiſhed theſe Characters; and when he ſaw her, he turned himſelfe in a very jocund manner towards her, and ſaid: Oh my faireſt Miſtreſſe, what good Fate ſent you hither unto me? Better Fate then you could expect, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe; for I am not only come my ſelfe unto you, but I have left behinde me two of your greateſt enemies. Since it is ſo, anſwered he, I do much more fear your blowes. My blowes, ſaid the ſhepheardeſſe, do not offend; or if they do, it is only ſuch as would have them do ſo. It is very true, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> they do indeed offend none, but thoſe as would have them do ſo: but yet that's the reaſon, why there are ſo many wounded; for all thoſe that ſee you, do deſire to receive your wounds. The blowes which are deſirable, replyed <hi>Diana,</hi> need not be feared. Your wounds, anſwered <hi>Silvander,</hi> are deſired, but not deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; and are terrible, but not terrifying. When I did ſay, that I feared them, it was rather to ſhew what I ought to do, then what I did. I ſhall but laugh at you, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> if you know your own good, and will not follow it. But to leave this diſcourſe, pray tell me, ſhepheard, from whom this Letter is, and to whom it is directed? <hi>Silvander</hi> not knowing how he loſt it, returned this anſwer: My heart, and your eyes, if they did but look in a glaſſe, would anſwer for me, that it is directed unto you, as, Unto the moſt fair, and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:53526:121"/>
the moſt loved ſhepheardeſſe in the whole Univerſe: And your ſeverity and my affection may tell you, that it comes from me, The moſt unfortunate, yet the moſt faithfull, of all your ſervants. But, (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi> unto him, and then <hi>Aſtrea</hi> with <hi>Phillis</hi> came to them) if this Letter came from you, why did you not write it? Becauſe, ſaid he, I found a better Secretary than my ſelfe; and I muſt needs ingenuouſly confeſſe, that there is ſomething ſupernaturall in it, ſince I found my own conceptions in it, without writing them; and ſince you have it, and I never gave it unto you: But, my good Angell, who was my Scribe, ſeeing I was too ſlow in preſenting it unto you, did ſteal it from me, though I did ſtay on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for an opportunity of privacy to preſent it. And why ſo, ſaid <hi>Diana?</hi> Do you think I will receive any Letters in private, which I would refuſe in publick? My intention of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy, replyed <hi>Silvander,</hi> was in conſideration of my ſelfe, and not of you, becauſe I had rather receive a denyall from you without a witneſſe, then before the face of my enemy: But I ſee, that he who aſſumed the boldneſſe to write of me, has found out a way to let you ſee it. I ſhall receive your excuſe, (ſaid <hi>Diana)</hi> upon condition, you will tell me, who was your Secretary. This laſt night, (anſwered the ſhepheard) after a long medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and entertainment of my own thoughts, I chanced to fall aſleep in a wood not far diſtant hence; and in the morning when I awaked, I found this Letter in my hand: At the firſt, I was much amazed at it; but after I had read it, I conceived, that ſome good Angell which loved me, and had read the ſame thoughts in my imagination, did write them in this paper for me, to preſent them unto you. <hi>Phillis,</hi> who had wit at will, ſeeing <hi>Diana</hi> mute, did ask him, if he knew the way unto the wood. No, ſaid he, if there be none but you that would go unto it: but, if it be the pleaſure of my Miſtreſſe, I will wait upon her unto it; and I aſſure my ſelfe, that the Trees which heard me almoſt all the night, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the diſcourſe which I had with my ſelfe amongſt them. <hi>Aſtrea</hi> being very deſirous to ſee the place, did make a ſigne with her eye unto <hi>Diana,</hi> that ſhe ſhould take him at his word; who thereupon asking, whether they had time enough to go and return, and being anſwered, Yes, ſhe intreated him, to conduct them all thither. <hi>Silvander,</hi> who was full of civility, and who deſired nothing more paſſionately, then to do any ſervice unto his fair <hi>Diana,</hi> did freely conſent to ſhew them the way. So <hi>Diana</hi> turning towards the ſhepheardeſſes, purpoſely to umbrage <hi>Aſtrea's</hi> deſigne, did very particularly intreat them, they would be pleaſed to go along with her, and they ſhould command her as much another time. <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> who was very glad, that <hi>Silvander</hi> took <hi>Diana</hi> to be the Author of this deſigne, did anſwer, That ſhe would moſt willingly follow her, whitherſoever ſhe was pleaſed to go. So committing the charge of their flocks unto one of their neighbours, who came accidentally, <hi>Silvander</hi> took the ſhorteſt way to the wood, and conducted them thither.</p>
               <p>Where the way was narrow and bad, <hi>Silvander</hi> alwaies went before; but aſſoon as they came into the Meadow, which is often watered by the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> he waited upon his Miſtreſſe, and led her by the arme. She, who had <hi>Phillis</hi> on the other ſide, who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt her and <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> did accept of her ſhepheards ſervice with a very good will, leſt the length of the way ſhould weary her; and giving him her left arme: You, <hi>Silvander,</hi> (ſaid ſhe) I make uſe of you in this voyage as my Servant; and of you, <hi>Phillis</hi> for my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. <hi>Phillis</hi> deſiring to make <hi>Silvander</hi> talk, that the company might be the leſſe weary, and who would not have a word, ſo much to her advantage pronounced by <hi>Diana,</hi> to paſs unobſerved, ſhe addreſsed her ſelfe unto the ſhepheard, and asked him, what he thought of this favour? That it is greater, anſwered <hi>Silvander,</hi> then we deſerve. But, replyed <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> how do you take the difference that ſhe puts betwixt us? As a faithfull Servant ought to take what is pleaſing unto his Miſtreſs, ſaid <hi>Silvander.</hi> But you, ſaid the ſhepheardeſs, who are ſo great a ſtickler againſt jealouſie, have not you ſome ſparks of it your ſelfe, in ſeeing the great favour which your Miſtreſſe hath conferred upon me? I do perceive, ſaid he, that you meaſure my affection by your own, ſince you think any thing that pleaſeth my Miſtreſs, can diſpleaſe me: But however I were a meer ſimplician in matters of Love, if I did not think the favour ſhe hath done me, to be a very great honour unto me, and diſadvantageous unto you. <hi>Diana</hi> hearing this anſwer, ſmiled; and <hi>Phillis,</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected another kinde of an anſwer, was ſo ſurpriſed, as ſhe knew not what to ſay, but loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked earneſtly upon him: yet, he beginning to walk; <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſaid he, that ſmile is only a cloak for your ignorance; I have not yet made you underſtand, neither by my words nor my actions, any of Love's myſteries; but I do not accuſe any, except the defects that are in your affection. If I do not underſtand theſe myſteries, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> you might accuſe me
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:53526:122"/>
of ignorance, but not of defect in affection, ſince underſtanding is not an act of will, as affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is. You are miſtaken, ſaid the ſhepheard, and this is one of thoſe myſteries you are ignorant of, and whereof I do not accuſe either your underſtanding facultie, or your will, but this fair <hi>Diana.</hi> How, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> do you make me culpable of the ignorance of <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis?</hi> I do not think you culpable, fair Miſtreſs (replyed <hi>Silvander)</hi> but I do ſay, you are the cauſe (as I have learned from an antient Oracle) by which I underſtand (ſaid he, and turned towards <hi>Phillis)</hi> that I am better loved by our Miſtreſs then you are. <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> who had not yet ſpoke: This diſcourſe (ſaid ſhe) is the moſt obſcure, and the reaſons the moſt intricate, that ever I heard. Will you but pleaſe to give me leave, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> I am confident I ſhall cleer them unto you, and make you confeſs them as well as my ſelfe: And for your better underſtanding, I ſay once again that the reaſon why <hi>Phillis</hi> does not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the myſteries of Love, is becauſe ſhe does not love enough, and that for this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in her love I ought not to accuſe her will but <hi>Diana</hi> onely, as an ancient Oracle tells us, by which I know, that ſhe loves me more then ſhe doth <hi>Phillis;</hi> and this is the reaſon: When you deſire to know what is the will of the gods, unto whom do you uſe to addreſs your ſelves, to come to the knowledge of it? Doubtleſs, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> unto thoſe that are Prieſts in their Temples, and whoſe office it is, to wait at their Altars. And why do you not rather addreſs your ſelfe, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> unto thoſe that are more knowing than unto thoſe Miniſters of the Temple, who commonly are ignorant in every thing elſe but their Office? Becauſe, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> the gods do more freely communicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto thoſe that are entred into thoſe myſteries, and more familiar about their Altars, than unto any ſtrangers, though they be more knowing. See (ſaid <hi>Silvander</hi> then) the power of Truth, which conſtraines you to ſpeak it againſt your intention: For if you do not underſtand the myſteries of the god of Love, is not that a ſigne you are a ſtranger unto him? For you confeſſe, that the gods do communicate themſelves more freely unto thoſe who ſerve in their Temples, and wait at their Altars. But which way ſhould they ſerve at the Altar of the god of Love, unleſſe it be by Loving? Hearts are the only ſacrifices which are acceptable unto that deity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Do you not ſee then <hi>Phillis,</hi> that if you be ignorant in theſe myſteries, it is not a fault in your underſtanding, but in your love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if it ſhould be ſo, (ſaid <hi>Phillis)</hi> which I will never grant, how can you accuſe <hi>Diana</hi> for any defects in my affection? Is ſhe not fair enough? or, are not her merits ſufficient to make her ſelfe loved? This, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> is a ſecond myſtery of that god which I will explain unto you. <hi>Diana</hi> has no defects neither in beauty nor merit, but ſhe is all perfection; the defect is only in your ſelfe, that you do not love enough, and that your love does not equall thoſe admirable excellencies which you ſee in her: But, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible you ſhould love her in that height, becauſe ſhe does not love you, according to the Oracle of which I ſpoke. <hi>Venus</hi> ſeeing her Son ſo little, did ask the gods, what ſhe ſhould do to make him grow: To which queſtion ſhe received this anſwer, That ſhe ſhould get him a Brother, and then he would grow to full proportion; but as long as he was alone, he would never grow. Do you not ſee, <hi>Phillis,</hi> that this anſwer was given againſt you, and in favour of me? For, if your love be little, and a dwarfe, the reaſon is, becauſe it hath not a Brother. If mine, on the contrary, do excell the higheſt, it is, becauſe <hi>Diana,</hi> my moſt fair <hi>Diana,</hi> hath given it one, whom he loves, whom he honours: nay, whom he adores. And do you think, <hi>Silvander,</hi> replyed <hi>Phillis,</hi> that ſhe does love you better then ſhe does love me? It can be no more doubted, anſwered the ſhepheard, then truth it ſelfe The gods do never lie, Oracles are the interpreters of their will. How dare you tax an Oracle with any untruth? No, no, <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſince I do love this fair <hi>Diana</hi> better then you do, moſt certainly ſhe does love me better then ſhe doth you; otherwiſe, the gods would be impoſtors, and not gods. Many have been deceived, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of Oracles. 'Tis true, anſwered <hi>Silvander,</hi> but when that is, the contrary event doth preſently diſcover it and ſo they remain not long undeceived: But, the Oracle of which I ſpeak, is anſwered by ſuch conformable effects, both in you and me, that it would be impiety to doubt it; ſince, do what you can, you cannot make your love ſo great as mine: And to confirm it the more, is it not a common received opinion, that whoſoever will be loved, muſt love? Why, ſhepheard, (ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> and interrupted him) do you think by loving much, to make your ſelfe much loved? If you would give me leave to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this myſtery unto you, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> perhaps you would be as ready to confeſſe it, as you have been to interrupt me; but this is all I will ſay, if the way to get love be to love, then there is no doubt, but that <hi>Diana,</hi> who conſtraines me to love her with ſuch ardency
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:53526:122"/>
of affection, doth love me extreamly. <hi>Phlllis</hi> was dumb at this, not knowing what to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the ſhepheard, who indeed defended his cauſe but too well. <hi>Aſtrea</hi> whiſpered <hi>Diana</hi> in her ear: Never credit me again, (ſaid ſhe in a whiſper) if this ſhepheards jeaſt do not turn to earneſt, and if he do not, like children, who play ſo long with their finger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the candle, that at laſt they burn themſelves. <hi>Diana</hi> anſwered, that ſuch a thing might perhaps be, if I were as capable of burning, as he is of being burned; but, ſince he himſelfe is only in the fault, let him only bear the puniſhment: as for me, I do not intend to participate with him. This talk had continued longer, if <hi>Phillis</hi> had not interpoſed, and chid them for taking <hi>Silvander's</hi> part. We did not take his part, anſwered <hi>Diana;</hi> but we may well ſay, that you are too weak to argue with him, for his knowledge is much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove yours. But I would gladly know, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> how he can conceive, that what you ſaid unto him at the beginning, was more advantageous to him than to me; for, I do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it to be a greater honour unto me, ſince you did thereby choſe me to be your Companion. She did confer that honour indeed upon you, anſwered the ſhepheard, but her affection upon me. No, no, replyed the ſhepheardeſſe, under the name of Companion is both affection and honour comprehended, for they do almoſt ſignifie the ſame thing. You may as well aſſert, anſwered <hi>Silvander,</hi> that affection and flattery are the ſame, and not contrary. If that perſon whom you love beſt ſhould tell you, that your perfections do tranſcend any goddeſſe, would you not ſay, this is groſſe flattery? And why, poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thing that you are, do you not think the ſame of <hi>Diana,</hi> when ſhe ſayes, that you are her Companion? For, as you your ſelfe expound it, that Companion ſignifies, one like her ſelfe; and her perfections are ſo tranſcendently above all other women, as there cannot be a greater difference between men and gods, then betwixt you and her. Poor blinded <hi>Phillis,</hi> do you not ſee, that this ſweet word which is ſo pleaſing to you, is only pure flattery, which my Miſtreſſe is pleaſed to put upon you, to acknowledge in ſome ſort that ſhallow affection which you bear unto her? For, ſince ſhe cannot love you, ſhe will give you ſatisfaction in this coyne. In taking you for a Companion, ſhe ſhewes flattery, and flattery ſhewes ſmall affection: On the contrary, in taking me for her Servant, ſhe ſhewes the good will ſhe bears unto me, ſince I am capable of that favour, if any mortall man be. Oh impudence! (cryed out <hi>Phillis).</hi> Oh love! anſwered <hi>Silvander.</hi> Why, replyed the ſhepheardeſſe, do you think your ſelfe worthy to ſerve her, whoſe merits are above all mortalls? The greateſt gods, ſaid the ſhepheard, are ſerved by men, and are pleaſed with their ſervice and duty: Then why, if I be a man, as I hope you do not queſtion, will you not permit me to ſerve and adore my goddeſſe, eſpecially, ſince ſhe her ſelfe requires this holy duty from me? <hi>Phillis</hi> ſtanding mute, and conſidering well of <hi>Silvander's</hi> reaſons, ſhe knew not how to anſwer one word, but did really think, that <hi>Diana</hi> did confer a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter favour upon <hi>Silvander,</hi> then upon her; and therefore addreſſing her ſpeech unto her: Miſtreſſe, ſaid ſhe, upon conſideration of my enemies reaſon, I finde, that he is in the right, and that you have conferred more favour upon him than me: Is it poſſible, you ſhould do it intentionally? If you did, I ſhall have a juſt occaſion of complaint, and take it ill, he ſhould be ſo much advanced above his merit. I ſee, ſaid <hi>Diana</hi> coldly, that opinion hath a greater power of you then truth, and you are guided only by it: Within this quarter of an houre, you were boaſting of the favour which I did you, in preferring you before <hi>Silvander:</hi> And now, this opinion being changed, you complain of the contrary, ſo as I am afraid, that your affection alſo is nothing but opinion. No queſtion of it, ſaid <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> for every word ſhe hath ſpoken is an argument of it. Is it any argument of Love, <hi>Phillis,</hi> to finde fault with the actions of your Miſtreſſe? If they be to my diſadvantage, ſaid ſhe, would you have me to think well of them? It were but your duty to conform your ſelfe, and ſtrive to get more love then you have, ſaid <hi>Silvander.</hi> Would you have <hi>Diana</hi> conform her ſelfe unto your will, or ought you to conform your ſelfe unto hers? I wiſh to the gods, ſaid ſhe, that I had as much advantage over her, as it ſeemes ſhe hath given you over me. If it were ſo, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> pray tell me, which of you two ſhould be the Miſtreſſe and which the Servant? Truly, ſhepheardeſſe, I do not think you ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the leaſt ſcratch in Love's War. <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> who ſilently heard their difference, was at laſt conſtrained to ſay thus unto <hi>Diana:</hi> I think, wiſe ſhepheardeſſe, that this ſhepheard will take away from <hi>Phillis</hi> the uſe of her tongue. No, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> it is rather Love; for hitherto ſhe thought that ſhe had loved, but now ſhe ſees the contrary.</p>
               <p>Thus thoſe fair Shepheardeſſes deceived themſelves in the length of the way; and the Sun ſhining very hot, they asked <hi>Silvander,</hi> how far it was yet unto the place which he
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:53526:123"/>
conducted them unto; and underſtanding that they were about the mid way, they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to reſt themſelves at the next Fountain, or the next good ſhade they come unto; and <hi>Silvander</hi> told then, that they ſhould preſently come unto ſuch a one, where they ſhould finde a Cherry tree full of ripe fruite: In order to this reſolution, they doubled their pace; but meeting with <hi>Laonice, Hylas, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

Theſe ſhepheards and ſhepheardeſſes were walking together, ſeeking for cool ſhades, and pleaſent Fountaines, for they were ſtrangers; and having no flocks to keep, they paſſed away the time as pleaſantly as poſſibly they could: And intending not to part that day they walked up the banks of the delectable River of <hi>Lignon.</hi> Now theſe two Companies being met, <hi>Hylas</hi> preſently left <hi>Laonice,</hi> and came to <hi>Phillis,</hi> and ſhe left <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> and went to him; at which <hi>Silvander</hi> was not ſorry, thinking himſelfe in more abſolute poſſeſſion of his Miſtreſſe. <hi>Tircis</hi> ſeeing <hi>Aſtrea</hi> alone, for <hi>Thirſander</hi> did lead <hi>Maduntes,</hi> he addreſſed himſelfe in a humble manner unto her, and offered his ſervice in leading her: She, having a great eſteem of that ſhepheard, eſpecially becauſe there was a conformity betwixt their fortunes, did very willingly accept of his offer; ſo as every one had a Companion, except <hi>Laonice,</hi> who, as I told you formerly, having an extream de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be revenged of <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Silvander,</hi> all her aime was, to watch an occaſion of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſome miſchiefe: And to compaſſe her deſigne, ſhe kept a ſpying eye upon all their actions, hearkn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And becauſe one of thoſe ſhepheardeſſes did at that time ſing, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Tircis</hi> ſtopt, and turning towards thoſe which followed them, did make a ſigne, that they ſhould make no noiſe: But becauſe the Song was almoſt ended, they heard only this laſt verſe of it.</p>

Alſo, it is queſtionleſs, that he ſpeaks as he thinks, and his arguments and reaſons are the iſſues of his heart. I remember that when he came from <hi>Camargue</hi> unto <hi>Lyons,</hi> he got into the Temple amongſt the women, at the grand Feaſt; and if <hi>Palinice</hi> had not ſhewed much compaſſion upon him (for ſo is the name of this my Companion) certainly he had payed very dear for his curioſity: but ſhe finding, that his fault proceeded from folly, and not malice, diſguiſed him with a vail, and got him out of the Temple, then carryed him to his lodging, which was in a demi-Iſle, betwixt the <hi>Roſne</hi> and the <hi>Arar.</hi> This courteſy was enough to oblige <hi>Hylas,</hi> unto a gratefull viſit of <hi>Pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice:</hi> and her modeſty was ſuch, as would have given a check unto any but <hi>Hylas,</hi> from moving any matters of Love unto her: Yet, before the third viſit was paid, he acquainted her with his minde, and was as familiar, as if he had been brought up with her from his cradle. You have, fair one, (ſaid he unto her at the very firſt accoſt) preſerved my life, and good reaſon it ſhould be imployed in your ſervice; and I will do it, though only out of gratitude: And not to detract from your firſt favour which you have done me, I beſeech you accept this offer of my ſervice, and believe, that there is no perſon upon earth that can love you better then I, nor whoſe heart is ſwell'd with more affection. My Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who was unaccuſtomed to any ſuch expreſſions, did, at the firſt, anſwer him very cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but ſeeing he perſiſted, ſhe grew angry, and would not ſuffer him to uſe any ſuch lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: At the laſt, when by his continuall viſits ſhe found his humour, ſhe did nothing but laugh at him, which did not offend him at all; for he had this good quality, that as he was free with every one, ſo he allowed every one to be free with him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, his Love did ſo increaſe, that my companion did grow weary of him; not but that <hi>Hylas</hi> is certainly a man of much merit, and is owner of many qualities which deſerve Love; but ſhe being a Widow, and not intending to marry, this courtſhip could not but be very diſadvantageous to her. It ſeemes, that the Heavens had pitty upon <hi>Palinice,</hi> and at the ſame time ſent her a Companion, and preſently after that another, to help her to ſupport a burthen ſo heavie. <hi>Palinice</hi> had a Brother, who had been long a devoted Servant unto <hi>Cercenea,</hi> my companion, who now ſits next me. And reſpect being moſt in the hearts of thoſe that love moſt, <hi>Clorian</hi> (for that was the name of <hi>Palinice's</hi> brother) had not yet the confidence to acquaint the fair <hi>Circen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53526:124"/>
what <hi>Clorian</hi> did in good earneſt; ſo as he was only a ſuperficiall friend, whilſt the other loved him as his Brother; and the enſuing ſtory will make this appear: For <hi>Clorian's</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection unto <hi>Cercenea</hi> daily augmenting, and not daring to make it known unto her, <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> took notice of it. <hi>Cercenea</hi> took a journey to ſee her Father, who was ſick in a Town, within the Country of the <hi>Sebuſians,</hi> towards the <hi>Allobrogians</hi> by reaſon whereof, <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenea</hi> was long abſent from our Town and conſequently from <hi>Clorian.</hi> And becauſe, as I have heard ſay, there is no greater comfort to a true Lover then to think often of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Loved, <hi>Clorian</hi> did often retire himſelfe into a houſe which he had in that Town, that ſtood upon the top of a hill, towards the <hi>Sebuſians:</hi> From this place might be viewed the <hi>Roſne</hi> on one ſide, and <hi>Arar</hi> on the other; and one might alſo ſee the Forreſt of <hi>Mars,</hi> called <hi>

It was to this place whither <hi>Clorian</hi> did commonly retire himſelfe, and looking towards the <hi>Sebuſian</hi> plains, did raviſh himſelfe with thoughts of his fair <hi>Cercenea.</hi> It hapned, that <hi>Hylas</hi> being very familiar with him, and not finding him in the houſe, he made no queſtion but he was gon unto this Mount; and being jealous, that his Companion was in Love, (for he knew, that this ſolitude, and melancholly muſing, could proceed from no other cauſe) he went up the ſtairs as ſoftly as he could, and finding the dore halfe open, he ſaw him looking out of that window towards the <hi>Sebuſians,</hi> ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed in his own thoughts, that he could not hear it thunder, and therefore could not hear the noiſe which <hi>Hylas</hi> made, in opening the dore and entring; but he himſelfe ſpoke ſo loud, that <hi>Hylas</hi> could hear theſe words.</p>

No more I will not, (ſaid <hi>Clorian,</hi> after a little conſidering with himſelfe) for neither at this time, nor any other, will I ever hide any thing from you. I am ſatisfied al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> upon condition, you will ingenuouſly confeſſe, what I do already know. What is it, replied <hi>Clorian,</hi> which you deſire to know of me? I will not ask, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> what your malady is, but only from whence it proceeds. Oh <hi>Hylas,</hi> (ſaid he, and ſighed) you need not ask me who the cauſe is: But, I would to the gods, you could as eaſily give me any comfort, as I can freely ſatisfie your curioſity. So ſitting down upon a Couch, he told him of his affection, and how the love he bare unto <hi>Cercenea</hi> was ſo great, as he durſt never acquaint her with it.</p>

When <hi>Hylas</hi> heard the name of <hi>Cercenea,</hi> he thought he had heard of it before, though he could not well remember when or where, and therefore he asked him, which of all thoſe he had ſeen, was ſhe? Since you do not know her name, anſwered <hi>Clorian,</hi> I believe you never ſaw her; for her beauty is ſuch, that it is impoſſible you ſhould ſee her, and not enquire her name, and make you remember her: But when I calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the time of your comming unto this Town, I believe you never ſaw her. I came, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> at the laſt F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Well, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> though ſhe be never ſo fair, do you think, that ſhe would not be loved? Can you believe, that thoſe only who are ugly, will permit it? No, no if ſuch ſhould be told, they are loved, they would think themſelves jeer'd. I do not think, ſaid <hi>Clorian,</hi> that if Beauties b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Ah <hi>Clorian!</hi> their modeſty is not any ſorrow for being loved, but only becauſe they doubt, whether what is ſaid be true. And indeed, where is that woman, who when ſhe is aſſured of a mans affection, is not extreamly well pleaſed with it, and gives him no teſtimony of her ſatisfaction? No no, <hi>Clorian,</hi> of all the actions which we do, next unto thoſe that preſerve life, there is none ſo naturall as this of Love: And can you imagine women ſuch enemies to Nature, that they will hate what is naturall? Come, come, let me give you advice, which unleſſe you be a very Novice in Love, you will follow, and finde, that I am my Arts Maſter in ſuch things. Let <hi>Cercenea</hi> know, that you do love her, and that aſſoon as poſſibly you can; for, the ſooner ſhe knowes it the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner will ſhe love you.

When they give us theſe peeviſh anſwers, and refuſe the affection which we preſent unto them, they put me in minde of thoſe Phyſicians and Lawyers, that refuſe the Fee, yet put out their hand. I am older then you are, I have run through ſome parts of the world, and let me tell you, I have loved many; this gives me encouragement to ſpeak the more freely unto you, and you muſt not take any exceptions. Be certain that never any faint hearted Lover ſped well: And in matters of Love, no fault is ſo great, as, being too reſpectfull. He that will ſpeed well, muſt dare attempt, ask, begg importune, preſſe, take; nay, he muſt raviſh. Did you never know the humour of women, <hi>Clorian?</hi> Hearken unto the great Oracle, which in our time ſpoke thus.</p>

                  <l>She will reſiſt, that you at length</l>

               <p>He that has no courage to do thus, let me adviſe him, to take upon him ſome other trade then that of Love, for he will never thrive by it. <hi>Clorian,</hi> therefore my counſell is, that you do aſſume ſo much confident boldneſſe as not only to declare your love unto her, but to hope, that ſhe will love you again, ſo you will but let her know your minde. I cannot, generous ſhepheard, remember all the documents and amorous adviſes which <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> gave; but I underſtand ſince from <hi>Palmice,</hi> who heard her brother relate them, that he did make himſelfe appear to be his Arts Maſter in ſuch things. But, the concluſion of all was, that ſince <hi>Clorian</hi> had not ſo much confidence, as to declare his Love unto his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe; as ſoon as ſhe returned, which would be within a few daies, <hi>Hylas</hi> ſhould be his Advocate, and ſpeak for him. <hi>Hylas</hi> did very willingly accept of the imployment; for, ſaid he, I ſhall oblige two at once by it; to wit, <hi>Clorian,</hi> in doing him the good office, and <hi>Cercenea,</hi> in bringing her ſuch good newes. It hapned that preſently after, my Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on returned to the Town; and though the death of her Father had put her into a mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning habit, and though her own ſadneſſe was ſuitable unto it; yet all her ſorrowes had not
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:53526:125"/>
at all leſſened her beauty, but had added ſuch a kinde of ſweetneſſe unto her countenance, as invited all that ſaw her to love her, by reaſon of a certain attractive compulſion, which rendred her much more pleaſing. <hi>Hylas,</hi> in proſecution of his promiſe, no ſooner heard of her return, but he courted all opportunities to ſee her, in which <hi>Palinice</hi> was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to help him, becauſe her Brother deſired it. She, who knew nothing of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, and believed it to be only out of curioſity, was glad to ſatisfie her Brother, though ſhe cared not for the company of <hi>Hylas.</hi> As fortune was, <hi>Cercenea's</hi> Mother would offer a ſacrifice unto the gods, for the ſoul of her Husband, and did invite <hi>Palinice</hi> as one of her beſt friends; thither ſhe went, and with her <hi>Hylas:</hi> But ſee, if he be not as good a friend as a faithfull Lover: he no ſooner ſaw <hi>Cercenea</hi> again, but he was deep in love with her: I ſay, ſaw her again becauſe looking upon her, he remembered, that he had ſeen her before in the Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> when <hi>Palinice</hi> ſaluted her; and becauſe he then found ſome ſparks of good will unto her, his firſt flames did kindle again in his heart, as eaſily, as any Sulphure at the fire. Looking upon her therefore very ſeriouſly, he began by degrees to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that <hi>Cercenea</hi> was ſhe whom he ſaw in the Temple, and remembring how excellently ſhe could ſing, and all that Love could make him apprehend at the firſt ſight, he quite forgot his promiſe unto <hi>Clorian,</hi> and thought only how to ſpeak for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Thus you may ſee how dangerous a thing it is, to imploy a Second in ſuch a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. He accoſted her, afterwards ſaluted her: And ſhe, out of ſweet civility, returned him a ſalute again. Then both being in the Temple, and every one going to their devotion, he ſaid thus unto her: I ſee, fair <hi>Cercenea,</hi> that the ſight of you is fatall unto me, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming hither to be an aſſiſtant unto your ſacrifices, I am become a ſacrifice my ſelfe. She, who knew not the man, or ever heard of him, did look him in the face; and then, after a little conſideration, ſhe concluded him to be a ſtranger, both by his language and habit; becauſe, though they were made according to the garb of our Town, yet he did wear them in that manner, as was plain he was a ſtranger: For ſtrangers, though they do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe themſelves in our faſhion; yet, they have ſome trick or other in their Air, by which one may ſee, they are not of the ſame Country. And I do believe, that this difference is leſſe found amongſt the <hi>Franks,</hi> then any other Nation. Now <hi>Circenea</hi> not knowing <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſhe thought, that he had taken her for ſome other; and therefore, after ſhe had looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, ſhe turned ſleightly another way, and gave him no anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hylas</hi> not ſatisfied with this, he pulled her by the Gown, and ſaid: What, fair one, no anſwer to a civill queſtion? I thought, ſaid ſhe, that you had not ſpoken unto me, or that you had addreſſed your ſpeech unto ſome other; for I do not know what you mean, by your fatall ſight and your ſacrifice. It is to you only, fair one, whom I ſpeak, ſaid he, and to none other but your ſelfe: that is, to the faireſt, and moſt Angelick beauty, that e're my eyes did ſee, whoſe firſt ſight of you, had like to have coſt me my life, and ſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe will the ſecond, if I do not finde you as kinde and favourable, as <hi>Palinice</hi> was at that time. I pray, ſaid ſhe, how kinde was <hi>Palinice</hi> unto you? She ſav'd my life, anſwered he, when the night before the Feaſt of <hi>Venus,</hi> your beauty kept me ſo long in the Temple, that I knew not how to get out. I do not remember any ſuch thing, ſaid <hi>Cercenea,</hi> or that I ever ſaw you. Whether you did or no, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> yet love you I muſt; and in lieu of aſſiſting at your ſacrifice, as I did intend to do, I have aſſiſted at that ſacrifice, which Love hath made of me unto you: However, I ſhould think my ſelfe extreamly happy, if I could finde any room in your affection. I ſee, ſaid ſhe, you are a ſtranger, and doe not know me; and I do believe, that my affection is very indifferent unto you. Upon this, ſhe turned away, and one of her Companions comming accidentally into the Temple, ſhe gave her place unto her, as if out of courteſy, and got as neer her Mother as poſſibly ſhe could; and all the while that the ſacrifice laſted, ſhe would not come neer him. But <hi>Hylas</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving broke the Ice, he would go through, and was not a man that would ſit down in the mid way.</p>
               <p>He found a way, by the means of <hi>Palinice,</hi> to come into <hi>Cercenea's</hi> Chamber, and in concluſion, grew very familiar, making <hi>Clorian</hi> believe all this while that it was for his ſake he frequented her company ſo much. But ſuch was the humour of <hi>Hylas,</hi> as he did not think it enough to deceive his friend, and to love both <hi>Palinice</hi> and <hi>Cercenea;</hi> but, one night as we were walking together, he expreſſed himſelfe as fair unto me as unto them, and that before he knew my name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hylas,</hi> who as I told you before, was hearkning, he could not chuſe, though it was contrary to his deſigne, but ſhew himſelfe, and ſay: Why, fair <hi>Florice,</hi> do you think it
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:53526:126"/>
was your name that I was in love withall? <hi>Hylas</hi> repented he had ſo raſhly ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; but theſe ſtrangers were exceedingly aſtoniſhed, when they ſaw him ſo ſurpriſedly; and though they looked fully upon him, yet by reaſon of his alteration in habit, they knew him not at the firſt. But <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was very glad, who thought the diſcourſe of this ſtranger to be very long, and that it hindred her from that ſatisfaction which ſhe hoped for, in this voyage; yet, ſhe ſeemed to be ſorry, and with the reſt, all ſhewed themſelves. But <hi>Hylas</hi> ſeeming, as if he had purpoſely interrupted <hi>Florice,</hi> did run to her, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced her, and afterwards ſaluted the reſt; then turning to her again: Well, fair Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, ſaid he, muſt you needs renew my ſorrowes, and make thoſe wounds which you gave me to bleed afreſh? Oh, ſaid <hi>Florice,</hi> you need not fear any wounds, ſince you have ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny remedies, 'Tis true, anſwered <hi>Hylas,</hi> if all wounds were cured with the ſame remedies. But, to let this diſcourſe alone, I beſeech you tell me, what deſigne brought you unto this place? The deſign, ſaid <hi>Florice,</hi> was not to meet you here. If it had, ſaid <hi>

Then <hi>Hylas</hi> ſtepping back two or three paces; This is too much, ſaid he, to fight againſt three at once; <hi>Hercules</hi> himſelfe would not undertake two.

               <p>It was the cuſtome of all <hi>Lignon</hi> ſhepheards, when they met any ſtrangers, to uſe them with all poſſible aſſiſtance, conceiving themſelves obliged unto it by the Lawes of Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality: This cuſtome of civility invited <hi>Aſtrea, Diana,</hi> and their company, to treat theſe ſtrangers accordingly, and afterwards to ask them the occaſion of their voyage? Unto which <hi>Florice</hi> anſwered in the name of all, That being ſent into this Country by dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their gods, who had forbidden them to reveal the cauſe, they durſt not diſobey them, and therefore they could not give them ſatisfaction.

Have not I good reaſon to quit them all for theſe fair ſhepheardeſſes, ſince the ſimplicity of my humour and ſpirit doth more ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize with their naturall beauty, then with thoſe artificiall tricks which are uſed in your Townes? If ever you did order your actions with judgment (ſaid <hi>Florice)</hi> I muſt confeſſe it is in this; but nor for any conformitie of humours that is betwixt theſe fair ſhephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes and you, for in that, you are far different: but becauſe <hi>Hylas</hi> having been all his life very wavering in his affection unto all others, will become more conſtant here, if at the leaſt perfection of beauty be able to do it: and for my part, I do believe he is, ſince not finding any better in any other place, he is forced to reſt here. It does concern me, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> to anſwer, becauſe <hi>Hylas</hi> is my ſervant; yet believe it, I will not anſwer for his fidelity, ſince I muſt needs think, that having once loved ſo great a Beauty as yours, and falling off, that it is not beauty which makes him in Love. What then, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> can it be? An humour of changing, ſaid <hi>Florice,</hi> and a certain levity of minde, that will not let you continue foure and twenty houres in one opinion. Oh! ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> you are a partie, and therefore your judgment may be ſuſpected. If you mean, anſwered ſhe, that I am the party offended, I do freely forgive the injury, and do think my ſelfe more obliged unto you for your changing, then I ſhould have received ſatisfaction in your conſtancy: And if you think me a party, that does pretend any thing unto you, believe it, <hi>Hylas,</hi> I will with
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:53526:126"/>
all my heart quit all my pretenſions, unto any that will have them, who, if they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, they will more oblige me by it, then they will finde benefit by the gift. You have reaſon to diſpoſe thus of me, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> halfe angry; for you may as freely diſpoſe of me, as of the ſtars.</p>
               <p>All this while, <hi>Paris</hi> had addreſſed himſelfe unto <hi>Diana,</hi> whom after he had ſaluted; This, ſaid he, is a more happy encounter, than I could ever have hoped for, ſince I did the leaſt expect you here. It is indeed happy for me, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> ſince we ſhall enjoy your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, unleſſe theſe fair ſtrangers do deprive us of it. At this word ſhe bluſh'd, knowing that <hi>Paris</hi> loved her. As this bluſh did pleaſe <hi>Paris,</hi> ſo it had a contrary effect in <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> who knowing that <hi>Paris</hi> loved her, could not defend himſelfe againſt ſome ſtings of jealouſie, when he ſaw the good reception of his Rivall; and this experience taught him to confeſſe, that jealouſie might proceed from love. The ſhepheardeſſe, who had no incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to hate <hi>Silvander,</hi> took notice of it, and ſo did <hi>Laonice,</hi> though the ſhepheard did diſſemble it as well as he could; and they had known it better, if <hi>Aſtrea</hi> had not parted them; for, deſiring moſt paſſionately to finiſh their journey, ſhe broke company: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Paris</hi> had taken <hi>Diana</hi> by the arme, <hi>Silvander</hi> went towards <hi>Phillis,</hi> who ſeeing him comming: It ſeemes (ſaid ſhe unto him) that we are too too many, and that, though we were abſent, they could entertain themſelves. I cannot deny it, ſaid <hi>Silvander;</hi> I muſt ſhrug my ſhoulders patiently, and pay this kinde of tribute without murmur. When he would have anſwered farther, <hi>Hylas</hi> came to them, and not caring for theſe ſtrangers, ran unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> and leſt <hi>Palinice, Cercenea,</hi> and <hi>Florice,</hi> as if he had never loved them. <hi>Diana,</hi> who could not chuſe but admire this humour in him, did make a ſigne unto <hi>Phillis</hi> by way of wonder. <hi>Phillis,</hi> who did eſteem him as an excellent man to make ſport, after ſhe had looked upon him: But <hi>Hylas,</hi> (ſaid ſhe unto him) can I believe you to be in earneſt?

                  </gap>nce I have left all theſe whom I did love, to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you. That is an excellent argument indeed, ſaid ſhe; but, I pray tell me, did you ever love theſe ſtrangers whom you have left to come unto us? You may gather as much, ſaid he, from <hi>Florice's</hi> own mouth. I had ſome reaſon (ſaid ſhe) to ask this queſtion; for if you did ever love them, how could you finde a heart to leave them ſo ſoon, in a place where they are ſtrangers? Even as I have heretofore left others for them, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſo now I do leave them for you; and I muſt needs confeſſe, that if my affection unto you were not much above all termes of civility; I ſhould have thought my ſelfe in ſome ſort obliged to wait upon them. Doubtleſſe, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> you do very much oblige me; but I do admire, that ſince you did love them, you ſhould now make ſo little account of them. I did love them, 'tis true, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> but I will do ſo no more, my love to them is now dead; and me-thinks this ſhould be no ſuch great piece of wonder, to ſee a man free, when the cord which tyed him is broken. I do believe, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> that <hi>Hylas</hi> did never love theſe ſtrangers; for if he had, he would have loved them ſtill, ſince the cords of Love cannot be broken. Though they cannot be broken, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> yet I am ſure they may be untied. No, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> all Love knots are Gordian knots. If they be, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> I have a ſword as well as he, who when he could not untie them, did cut them, and I am ſure I have done ſo ſeverall times.</p>
               <p>Never believe you did love them, ſaid <hi>Silvander;</hi> for if you had, you would have loved them ſtill. Shall I not believe what I do know, ſaid <hi>Hylas?</hi> But, to do you a pleaſure, I will not believe it. But pray trouble neither me nor your ſelfe any further; keep your ſelfe to your own melancholly humour, and vex me no more with your impertinent opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phillis,</hi> who was diſcreet, and ſeeing <hi>Hylas</hi> in his angry altitudes, to interrupt him, ſaid thus: However, <hi>Hylas,</hi> I muſt needs be angry with you, for hindring me from knowing ſome things which theſe ſtrangers had begun to relate. Miſtreſſe, anſwered he, I had rather never have loved them, then you ſhould miſſe of your ſatisfaction by any means of mine. I know, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> that the love you bear unto them, and the ſatisfaction you ſpeak of, will not trouble you; for, ſince you do not love them now, what will it concern you, whether you did or did not love them? Why, my Faireſt, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> do you not eſteem paſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments? If my contentment do not continue, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> the remembrance of it does but grieve me the more. The ſervices then that were done you a week ſince, ſaid he, are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd; if it be ſo, the worſe for <hi>Hylas. Silvander</hi> anſwered in the behalfe of <hi>Phillis:</hi> Your Miſtreſſe, ſaid he, does not ſpeak of ſervices, but of contentments received; and before you complain, it is requiſite to know of her, whether your ſervices be in that rank. <hi>Hylas</hi>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:53526:127"/>
anſwered: Thoſe who miſtruſt their own merits, as you do, may make that doubt, but not I. <hi>Silvander,</hi> who knowes that Love cannot be paid but by Love again, and ſhe, unto whom I devote mine, hath more goodneſſe, then not to acknowledge it, and more judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then not to eſteem it. <hi>Silvander</hi> would have anſwered but <hi>Phillis</hi> interpoſed: I do eſteem <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid ſhe, as I ought to do, and do acknowledge, his merits are very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to beloved; nor need he think his ſervices are forgotten; for, he continuing to love me, they are all eſteemed as preſent: And if this declaration do pleaſe him, I will requeſt one thing of him which he ought not to deny me, unleſſe he would have me think, that he does not love me. Command, faireſt, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> what you pleaſe, but two things; that I die, or that I ceaſe loving you; and I obey: for if I die, I cannot love you, and if I do not love you, I cannot delight in any life. May you, and your love to me, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> be immortall, and ſo they ſhall before they die, by my command. But my deſire is, to have a relation of that from your own mouth, which you hindred <hi>Florice</hi> from imparting to us. <hi>Diana</hi> hearing this requeſt, and being much offended with the extremity of the Suns heat, did ſay, ſhe would be a very willing Auditor, ſo they could finde out an umbrage from the Sun's heat; for ſhe believed, the diſcourſe of <hi>Hylas</hi> would be very pleaſant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> who longed to go about their buſineſſe, did think as much, and therefore in compliance unto <hi>Diana's</hi> will, ſhe ſaid, that ſhe would make one. So, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> it ſhall not ſtick upon me; and I ſhould think my ſelfe to be very bad company, if I were not very willing to give you ſatisfaction, and my ſelfe alſo, for I do believe, there is as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in thinking upon old and paſt Loves, as if they were preſent; for the delights of Love are commonly more in the imagination, then in the thing it ſelfe; and in relation of things paſt the ſoul doth caſt her eye upon thoſe images which remain in the fancy, and looks upon them as if they were preſent. And therefore let us look out for a convenient ſhade, from the rayes of the Sun. It is impoſſible, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> to finde a more convenient place in all the Wood, then by this little brook which you ſee; for the coolneſſe of the ſhade, and murmure of the water, is very inviting; beſides, it is nothing out of our way. All the company concur with him; and when they came unto it, every one began to waſh their hands, and ſit round the Fountain of it, unleſſe <hi>Silvander,</hi> who got into a great Cherry Tree, which made part of the ſhade unto the Fountain, and brought ſome of the beſt Cherries unto <hi>Diana,</hi> who gave ſome to <hi>Paris</hi> and the ſhepheardeſſes, and picking out ſome of the beſt, ſhe gave them unto <hi>Silvander,</hi> ſaying; Here <hi>Silvander,</hi> I muſt needs give you ſome, who gave them unto me. I would to god (ſaid he, and kiſſed the hand that gave them) you would receive all I give you with as good a will as this. Then taking his place as neer her as he could, <hi>Hylas,</hi> when they had eaten all their Cherries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his diſcourſe thus.</p>

               <p>I Have often laughed in my thoughts, at all thoſe who condemn inconſtancy, and are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed enemies againſt it, conſidering, that they themſelves are not able to be as they ſay, nor more conſtant, then thoſe, whom they brand with that vice; for, when they do fall in love do they not fall in love with Beauty, or ſomething they think that is pleaſing unto them? Now when this Beauty doth fade, as time doubtleſſe will make all Beauty do, are not they inconſtant, in ſtill loving thoſe faces that are now grown ugly, and retain nothing of what they were, but only the very name of a face? If to love that, which is contrary unto that which was loved, be inconſtancy; and if uglineſſe be contrary unto beauty: then he that did love a fair face, and continues loving it when it is ugly, muſt be concluded inconſtant. This conſideration makes me think, that the way to avoid inconſtancy, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to love beauty, and when it fades, farewell love; finde ſome other that is fair, and ſtill love beauty, and not its contrary, unleſſe you be unconſtant to your firſt love. I know full well, that this is point blank againſt the opinion of the vulgar: But, by way of anſwer, let me tell you, that the Heard of people, the vulgar, is but a heard of rude and ignorant beaſts and in this, they give a true teſtimony of it.</p>
               <p>Do not think it ſtrange, faireſt Miſtreſſe, nor you generous <hi>Paris,</hi> if in relating the ſtory of my life you hear of many ſuch changes: For, I am ſo carefull not to decline from this conſtancy, that I had rather quit all thoſe whom hitherto I have loved, then recede from it. You have formerly been acquainted with the cauſe, why I came out of <hi>Camargues,</hi>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:53526:127"/>
how I came unto <hi>Lyons,</hi> why I loved <hi>Palinice</hi> and <hi>Cercenea.</hi> And when I interrupted <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,</hi> ſhe would have told you, how ſhe began to captivate me; but becauſe ſhe forgot ſome things which are requiſite you ſhould know, I ſhall ſpeak out that, which ſhe did ſo ſubtlely conceal, and then relate the ſtory of my life, if we have time enough.</p>
               <p>Be pleaſed to know, then, faireſt Miſtreſſe, that <hi>Clorian</hi> was very ill adviſed, in employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to be his ſpokeſ-man unto <hi>Cercenea;</hi> in ſuch a buſineſſe as that, it is dangerous to make choice of a friend, that is better accompliſhed then himſelfe; a hundred to one, but in lieu of Friend, he becomes a Lover; and he that ſent him, not loved; for, if his Miſtris have any wit, ſhe will chuſe the better. The truth is, when I went with <hi>Palinice</hi> unto <hi>Cercenea,</hi> in the behalfe of <hi>Clorian,</hi> my intention was to ſerve him as a friend, and to uſe all poſſible addreſſes, which might conduce unto his contentment; but, aſſoon as I ſaw this Beauty, I remembered, that I my ſelfe was in love with her, ever ſince I ſaw her that night in the Temple; ſo as now the ſtate of the queſtion was whether I ſhould ſtifle Friendſhip, or ſtifle Love; and after a long debate with my ſelfe unto which I ſhould yield, I concluded, that the laſt commer muſt give place unto the firſt. Love told me, that it had taken poſſeſſion of my ſoul almoſt aſſoon as I was born, and that my affection unto <hi>Cercenea,</hi> was before my love of <hi>Palinice,</hi> which was the cauſe of my friendſhip with <hi>Clorian;</hi> and therefore my friendſhip coming after my love, it is injuſtice if I let it keep ſtill in poſſeſſion. No ſurely, thought I, we ſee the Lawes allow primogeniture in Children, and Nature it ſelfe ſeemes to approve of it. This was the reaſon why I applyed my ſelfe unto <hi>Cercenea,</hi> as <hi>Florice</hi> hath told you. And I beſeech you judge, whether I am obliged to endeavour the contentment of another, before my own. Why ſhould ſhe upbraid me with the name of Traitor to my friend? For, if of two evills, the leſſer be alwaies to be choſen; if killing ones ſelfe be the worſt of murders, who, that is in his ſenſes, will ſay, but I had better betray friendſhip then love, and have a greater regard unto the preſervation of my own life and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then the life and contentment of <hi>Clorian? Clorian</hi> loved me, and I loved <hi>Cercenea; Clorian</hi> deſired me to ſpeak for him, and my affection bad me ſpeak for my ſelfe: If I did not ſatisfie <hi>Clorian,</hi> I offended againſt my friendſhip to him; if I did not ſatisfie my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I offended againſt <hi>Cercenea</hi> and <hi>Hylas.</hi> I do love <hi>Clorian,</hi> and I do love <hi>Hylas</hi> alſo. Put ſelfe and another in the ſcales, and ſelfe, I dare ſay will out-weigh: So I and <hi>Clorian.</hi> The gods did favour my deſigne, ſo as <hi>Cercenea,</hi> after ſome courtſhip, did love me may be, as well as I loved her, and when you know what aſſurances of it ſhe did give me, I believe you will ſay as much as I. But becauſe there was ſome unto whom ſhe owed duty, and particularly her Mother, ſhe deſired me to let her faign as if ſhe loved <hi>Clorian,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was already ſome probability of a Marriage betwixt them, being both of one Town, and one quality. Moreover, <hi>Clorian</hi> being very rich, her Mother would doubtleſſe like well of the Match; whereas if my love unto her had been diſcovered, being a ſtranger, and perhaps had a wife in ſome other place, ſhe would have diſallowed of it, and perhaps charged her daughter not to ſee me.</p>
               <p>I was very glad of the motion, becauſe I knew not with what language I could put <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> off any longer, having worn out all my excuſes, till they were thread-ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, ſo as he ſeeing me ſo much with <hi>Cercenea,</hi> and yet doing nothing for him, began to be in ſome doubt of me. Then I acquainted <hi>Cercenea</hi> with all paſſages betwixt <hi>Clorian</hi> and me, and how he had employed me to ſpeak unto her. But, faireſt Miſtreſſe. I told her by way of mocking him, leſt if I ſhould have ſet forth unto her his affection as it was, ſhe ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain any ſparks of love unto him; but, I did it ſo dexterouſly, that <hi>Cercenea</hi> had a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter minde to make uſe of him as a cloak for her love of me, with leſſe ſuſpition and told me. That her Mother had often propoſed him unto her for a Husband, and that ſhe knew he had ſome good will unto her. Then I went unto <hi>Clorian,</hi> unto whom I faigned a long Prologue, as an introduction of what I intended to ſay; I related unto him the ſpeeches, anſwers, and replyes, that I made in his behalfe, and did aſſure him, that I had made a way for his affection to finde a welcome. Oh! what thanks did he give me, and what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to ſerve me upon the like occaſion: for which I thanked him, but did not deſire to be in his hands as he was in mine. At the laſt, he took heart, and according to my advice, he reſolved to ſpeak of it unto <hi>Cercenea;</hi> but, with more fear and heart-beating, then if he were to fight with the moſt valiant man alive: Yet, the courage which I had infuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and aſſurance that he ſhould be welcome to her, did make him ſurmount thoſe fears which had ſolong ſilenc'd him; and finding an opportunity, he acquainted her with his intentions in the beſt language he could invent, the effect of which was, that he bore unto
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53526:128"/>
her ſo much humble reſpect, as, without me, he never had durſt to declare his affection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her; that it was all purity and vertuous deſires. Truly (anſwered ſhe) you have a very good friend of <hi>Hylas,</hi> and you may well think him ſo, and by all meanes preſerve ſuch a Jewell; for he hath done nothing above a month, but continually talk in commendation of you: Alſo, you may underſtand from him, that I am not ſo obdurate as you imagine, but does think my ſelfe obliged to entertain a man of your merit, when you come with honeſt and pure deſignes of Marriage, as your friend tells me you do; and therefore I am contented to live with you, according to the purity of ſuch affection; but I ſhall be very glad to have <hi>Hylas</hi> a witneſſe of all that paſſeth betwixt us, that he may arbitrate all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters betwixt us. I muſt be briefe, my fair <hi>Phillis,</hi> otherwiſe an age would not ſerve, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late all the accidents that befell me. But be pleaſed to know, that ever ſince this day, <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> was ſo far ingaged, that he could not retreat; and becauſe their Parents began to take notice of it, I did acquaint her Mother, that <hi>Clorian</hi> did intend to marry her Daughter, and that, becauſe I thought it an advantageous Match unto <hi>Cercenea,</hi> I had contributed all my endeavours to bring it about; but, ſince I had not yet ſpoken of it unto his Father and Mother, I deſired, that the buſineſſe might be kept ſecret. <hi>Cercenea's</hi> Mother knowing <hi>Clorian</hi> to be rich and well born did heartily thank me for my endeavours, and did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that if <hi>Clorian</hi> had any ſuch minde, he would ſpeak unto her, and ſhe would keep it as ſecret as he pleaſed; but ſhe deſired, to have that ſatisfaction from himſelfe. I aſſured her, he ſhould; and accordingly, within a few daies after, we went unto her again, and <hi>Clorian</hi> told her more then I had done. Thus all things went very well; for my part, I was wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to the Mother, more welcome to <hi>Clorian,</hi> but moſt of all to <hi>Cercenea.</hi> You ſee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what a paſſe I was brought: to ſeem as if I did not love this fair one, I was forced to quit my place unto <hi>Clorian,</hi> and to ſpeak for him. When there was any company, I ſtood before them, that <hi>Clorian</hi> might unſeen kiſſe her hand; but, it vexed me to the ſoul, when he kiſſed her mouth, as often he did in my preſence: And though it did diſpleaſe me very much, and <hi>Cercenea</hi> more, yet we did conſtrain our ſelves, that ſhe and I might have ſome opportunities ſometimes of privacy: For the Mother, believing me to be a mediator only for <hi>Clorian</hi> did give me all the liberty I could deſire. Nay more, I brought her Letters from <hi>Clorian,</hi> and oftentimes did anſwer them my ſelfe, for ſhe did only write them, and god knowes, not without much laughter and jearing of him.</p>
               <p>Thus did I live, the moſt contented man alive, till Fortune upon a ſudden turn'd the wheel and yet it went not ſo neer my heart, as it would anothers, becauſe I had ſo good a receipt againſt all ſuch maladies. The <hi>Facchanalian</hi> Feaſts being at hand to be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>Clorian</hi> and I reſolved to maintain a Tournement. <hi>Clorian</hi> took for his device a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Circe</hi> (with <hi>Circenea's</hi> face) amongſt the Companions of <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> with this Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <hi>To her had fewer Charmes.</hi> But I not daring to declare my ſelfe as he did, I did a little diſguiſe her name, and painted a <hi>Syren,</hi> and <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> tyed to the Maſt of his Ship, with this Motto, <hi>What B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As chance was, there was a young Beauty in <hi>Lyons,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> a neer neighbour unto my lodging, with whom, how ever it came to paſſe, I had no great familiarity; for it was not my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to have any fair neighbours, and not to viſit them. When I was in the Liſts, thoſe that were curious, began to interpret our devices; as for that of <hi>Clorian,</hi> every one could eaſily underſtand it, <hi>Circenca's</hi> face, and the clinch of her name, did ſufficiently diſcover it: But, as for mine, none could give it a meaning. At the laſt an old Knight that was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scaffold, amongſt the Ladies where <hi>Cercenea</hi> was, and <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> and whoſe age excuſed him from being in Armes, he ſaid, that it was eaſie to diſcover his meaning; and then addreſſing himſelfe unto <hi>Parthenopea:</hi> It is for you, fair One, ſaid he, that he enters into the Liſts. At this, ſhe bluſh'd and thinking her ſelfe wrongfully accuſed, did anſwer: If it be for me, he is very ſecret in his matters, for he never ſpoke to me. Take heed (ſaid <hi>Cercenea,</hi> who thought her ſelfe concerned) that you do not diſſemble, and carry it more cloſe then he doth. It is an eaſy matter, ſaid ſhe, to carry that ſecret which I do not know. If you pleaſe to know the reaſon of my opinion (ſaid the old Knight) I ſhall tell you, and I am confident your judgments will agree with mine. I ſhall be very glad, ſaid ſhe, to underſtand this ſecret from you. You ſee then (replyed the old Knight) that he bears a <hi>Syren</hi> upon his Shield, with this Motto, <hi>What Bonds would be ſufficient?</hi> he could not more plainly name you, then by the painting of a <hi>Syren;</hi> for the Ancients ſay, that the <hi>Syrens</hi> were three Daughters of <hi>Achiloes,</hi> by the Nymph <hi>Calliope;</hi> and were called <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra,</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:53526:128"/>
                  <hi>Leucoſia,</hi> and <hi>Parthenopea;</hi> and your name being <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> he could not more clearly expreſſe his meaning then by a <hi>Syren,</hi> and <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> tyed to the Maſt of a Ship, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that nothing can hinder him from being yours, if by your favours you will be his. Then all the company cryed out; Oh <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> how cloſely have you kept it? But you had now better to confeſſe then deny it. For my part, ſaid ſhe, it is all one whether it be ſo or no, for it concernes me but a little. I hope then ſaid <hi>Circenea,</hi> you will not be angry if we call him your Knight. I do not care ſaid ſhe, but have a care you do not call him wrong. The report went preſently amongſt the Ladies that I was the <hi>Syren's</hi> Knight, and <hi>Clorian Cyrenea's.</hi> For my part, I knew nothing of it, but took notice, that as I paſſed under the Scaffold, <hi>Cercenea</hi> cryed out unto me, Adieu the Knight of <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> but I knew not what ſhe meant.</p>
               <p>At laſt, the Tourney being ended, every one retired; and <hi>Clorian</hi> and I thinking we had behaved our ſelves very well, aſſoon as we had put off our Armes, we went unto <hi>Cercenea;</hi> but ſhe being infinitely incenſed againſt me, did not look upon me with her uſuall ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but when I ſpoke to her, ſhe would give no reply, but, Let me alone, Knight of the <hi>Syren,</hi> and in a ſcorning manner, turned away from me. I was ſo innocent in what ſhe accuſed me of, that I knew not what to think, unleſſe that I had ill acquitted my ſelfe in this Tournement, which I undertook to maintain: But not conceiving, that I had done any worſe then my Companion; and ſeeing that ſhe cheriſhed him, I could not imagine what to think.</p>
               <p>That night I retired, unſatisfied; for I could not obtain ſo much favour, as to ſpeak with her in private, but went away much diſpleaſed at my fortune. But the next morning, a chance happened, which ſpoiled all my affairs. Being that morning in the Temple, I ſaw there <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> with one of her Aunts; and ſeating my ſelfe by chance by her, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſhe did not look upon me with the eye of an enemy: She was fair, and conſequently one of thoſe, who by the Lawes of Conſtancy, I was obliged to love; and therefore I got a little neerer unto her, and watching for an opportunity of ſpeaking unto her, ſhe leaned towards me, and ſaid How Sir, do you like the Tournement? It is my part, ſaid I, to ask you that queſtion, ſince it is the office of ſuch Beauties as your ſelfe to judge. I do not ask you, ſaid ſhe, how you did behave your ſelfe, for every one can witneſſe, none could do better; but I would gladly know, whether you be not weary after all the pains you took? Since, fair one, ſaid I, you have given ſuch an advantageous judgment for me, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I ſhould be weary. We were in a place where long diſcourſe was not handſome, and therefore ſhe anſwered me only with a ſmile, and turned the other way When prayers and devotions were done, ſhe went out of the Temple; and I conceiving my ſelfe obliged by her language to wait upon her to her lodging, which was neer, I took her by the hand, and by the way I underſtood how it was the opinion of every one, that I maintained the Tournement as her Knight. I being glad to umbrage my affection unto <hi>Cercenea,</hi> and moreover taken with the favours of <hi>Parthenopea</hi> I anſwered her, that it was true and that not daring to declare it by my words, I made choice of that way. After much diſcourſe, and when we were come unto her lodging ſhe took off her Scarfe, and laid it upon the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; afterwards her Mask, and ſtanding to the fire, ſhe talked unto me and I perceived, that what I had done, was not diſpleaſing unto her, becauſe ſhe ſtill renewed the diſcourſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: And the more I ſaw my ſervice pleaſed, the more fell I in love with her. In concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before I parted, I took her Scarfe which lay upon the Table, and though ſhe made a little reſiſtance, yet I put it about my neck, and told her, That ſince I undertook a Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement for her, without any mark of my affection, it was reaſonable I ſhould have that, as a teſtimony of my being hers; her reſiſtance was not great, and therefore I carried it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and wore it about my neck all the reſt of the day. However, becauſe I would not loſe <hi>Cercenea,</hi> I would not go into any place where ſhe was in probability of ſeeing me: But he whom I doubted the leaſt, which was <hi>Clorian,</hi> told her, not intending any hurt unto me, that I was the moſt contented man in the world, with the favours of <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> and thereupon told her of the Scarfe. Oh how this went to her very heart, for ſhe did really love me, and yet ſhe made no ſhew of any diſcontent. But the next morning when I went unto her, and <hi>Clorian</hi> not there: Oh Knight of the <hi>Syren,</hi> ſaid ſhe, what have you done with your fine Scarfe? I muſt tell you that I did love <hi>Cercenea</hi> much better then I did <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenopea,</hi> and would not loſe her upon ſo ſmall an occaſion; and therefore I ſwore a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand oaths that when I undertook the Tournement, I had not the leaſt thought of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenopea;</hi> but upon the word of <hi>Syren</hi> only, which had a reſemblance unto <hi>Cercenea.</hi>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:53526:129"/>
But, ſaid ſhe, why did you not tell me of it? Becauſe, anſwered I, I thought the thing ſo plain, that you would know it this way. And what do you (ſaid ſhe) concerning this Scarfe? I muſt confeſs, ſaid I unto her, that I took it from <hi>Parthenopea</hi> yeſterday, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to diſguiſe my affection unto you under that vail. <hi>Cercenea</hi> ſtood ſilent a while, and then began thus: Well <hi>Hylas,</hi> I wil believe all you tell me provided you will give me ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in one thing. It ſhall be impoſſible (ſaid I) if I do not. Give me the Scarfe, replyed ſhe, which you took from <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> and in exchange, I ſhall give you another which is better. I was very loath to do it, and would gladly have come off with an excuſe, but it was impoſſible.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as ſhe had it, ſhe put it upon her arme, and gave me another, which indeed was much better; and the ſame day, knowing that I was not in my lodging, ſhe went with ſome of her friends (under colour of walking) unto my lodging, and ſent to ſee if I was not within: A ſervant of mine, whom ſhe knew, came to her, and told her, that I was not in my lodging. This good company and my ſelfe (ſaid ſhe) were deſirous of his company to walk with us: But prethee do me the favour to go and tell <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> that we ſtay here for her to that end; and in reward of thy ſervice, take this Scarfe, and wear it all this day for my ſake. Then ſhe put about his neck that Scarf which I had from <hi>Parthenopea.</hi> This varlet thought himſelfe mighty brave, and much honoured in this favour, and gave her moſt humble thanks; and to ſhew his ready obedience, ran as faſt as he could to deliver his meſſage unto <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> who ſeeing her Scarfe about the fellowes neck, ſhe had an opinion, that I cauſed him to wear it in ſcorn of her, and hearing his err<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd, did know very well, that it came from <hi>Cercenea,</hi> and that I had given it unto her; which did ſo extreamly offend her, that I could never ſince renew with her, and much leſſe with <hi>Cerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi> who abſolutely declined me, although ſhe plainly ſaw, that I did love her better then I did <hi>Parthenopea.</hi> But practiſing this Maxime, that one muſt hate them whom they have offended, ſo ſhe knowing her treaſon to be great, ſhe would never conſide in me again. I was conſtrained to return unto <hi>Palinice,</hi> but ſtayed not long; for it being then the ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of the year, theſe Ladies would many in a company, enjoy the ſweetneſſe of the aire, and go into the Country in a Barge, up the calm and ſmooth River of <hi>Arar,</hi> paſſing away the time, one while in muſick of Inſtruments, another while in that of Voices and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times landing, would dance upon the dazie Meadowes. As ill luck was, I had no acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance amongſt all this good company, but only <hi>Palinice</hi> and <hi>Cercenea;</hi> however, I thruſt in amongſt them, and undertook to entertain them all: I ſaw they all whiſpered, and asked who I was and <hi>Palinice</hi> had a great deal of trouble in telling my name unto all that asked her: But preſently after, I was as well known as any in the company, for, holding diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the firſt that did offer any, they found my humour ſo pleaſing, that all of them deſired my friendſhip. As long as the Barge went upward, although the River ran ſo ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as one could not tell which way it ran; yet, ſometimes it would make ſuch a noiſe againſt the ſtream, as they could uſe none but Inſtruments: but when it went downward, the waves made only a little daſhing againſt the Barge, and then thoſe who had good Voices, did ſing what came into their fancies. Amongſt this aſſembly of Beauties, there was many Knights, and children of Druides, to keep them company, and paſſe away the evening with more delight. This was the firſt time I ever ſaw <hi>Theombres:</hi> This man had almoſt paſſed the Autumne of his age, in ſuch a good opinion of himſelfe, as he thought all Ladies like to die for the love of him: For my part, I never could obſerve any taking quality in him; yet certainly, he had ſome features, which was not diſpleaſing unto ſome: Amongſt the reſt, <hi>Florice</hi> was one, who might come into the catalogue of thoſe who are called Fair: Indeed ſhe was fair, all her features pleaſing, but above all her eyes were ſo ſweet and alluring as I muſt confeſſe, I never ſaw ſuch; her ſtature was tall, and her minde ſo majeſtick, as one might eaſily ſee, ſhe was above vulgar extraction; and indeed ſhe was of that Family, who vaunts to be deſcended from the great <hi>Arioviſtes.</hi> And though this fair Lady was ſuch, as there was not one in all the Country, but did, and ought, to yield unto her, both in merit and beauty: Yet, <hi>Theombres</hi> was more in her affection, then any in the Town. And becauſe it was long ſince this Love began, and hung in a kinde of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing continuance, <hi>Theombres</hi> thought it beſt to awake it, by ſome ſparks of jealouſie; and therefore ſeemed as if he were in love with a young Beauty, called <hi>Dorinde,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was Miſtreſſe of ſome beauty, but yet yielded in all unto <hi>Florice:</hi>
Now <hi>Dorinde</hi> being gone out of the Town unto one of her Uncles, <hi>Theombres,</hi> to continue his diſſimulation, did alwaies, when he ſung, take <hi>Dorinde</hi> for the ſubject, and, as I remember, one Verſe of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53526:129"/>
it was, that when ſhe departed, ſhe vowed to keep him continually in her memory, which he took to be ſo great a happineſſe unto himſelfe, that he would not change fortunes with any Angell in heaven. The fair <hi>Florice</hi> did think her ſelfe much concern'd in this, and it being ſpoke in her preſence, ſhe was the more offended; and therefore in defence of <hi>Dorinde,</hi> who was ſome waies allied unto her, ſhe anſwered him in this manner.</p>

               <p>This retort upon <hi>Theombres</hi> by <hi>Florice</hi> did ſo pleaſe me, that ever ſince, I reſolved to love her, and add her unto <hi>Palinice</hi> and <hi>Cercenea.</hi> And preſently after, rowing by a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleaſant Meadow, it was the generall vote to land in it, and enjoy the beauty of the place: Some began to ſing, others to dance, and others to gather flowers, or to walk. <hi>Florice</hi> was one of thoſe, whoſe Genius was to make Noſegayes and Garlands; ſhe had ſeparated her ſelfe from company, and ſet down upon the graſſe, perhaps in ſome thoughts of what <hi>Theombres</hi> had ſaid. I accoſted her, not with an intention to fall on, but to try her, and as I found her tractable, ſo to go on, or make a retreat; alſo my conceit was, that <hi>Cercenea</hi> being made thereby a little jealous, might be moved to repentance: but it hapned quite otherwiſe, as you ſhall underſtand. However, I fell upon my knees by her, and was very officious in helping her to gather flowers: She, very civilly, took them at my hands, but wondred, that having never ſeen me before, that I ſhould take ſo much paines. I perceived it well enough, but ſtill waited, till her words gave me an occaſion to let her know, that I loved her. My reaſon, why I treated her at ſuch a diſtance of reſpect, was, the grandure and ſtate that ſhe kept, which in truth was ſuch, that of all I ever loved before, I never ſtood in ſuch reverentiall fear, as of her. It hapned as I hoped for after ſhe had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved many of the flowers which I gathered, ſhe told me, I had taken too much paines, and that I would think her to be uncivill, if ſhe ſuffered me to continue. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That I thought every one obliged to do her all ſervice, ſince ſhe had ſo excellently well defended her friend in her abſence. Do you mean <hi>Dorinde,</hi> ſaid ſhe unto me? The very ſame ſaid I, in whoſe perſon you have obliged all others. Truly, ſaid ſhe, I could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the vanity of <hi>Theombres;</hi> for you ſee what he is, and yet he thinks, we are all ready to die for the love of him. Then certainly, ſaid I, Ladies muſt needs be either very loving, or of very little judgment; for I think him to be rather a remedy againſt Love, then of any capacity to cauſe it. I am clearly of your opinion, ſaid ſhe; for, if I had an inclination to love, this man of all men living ſhould be the laſt I would chuſe. If you ſhould love him, ſaid I, it would be a grand offence againſt the gods, who having adorned you with ſo much beauty, you would that way profane it. I cannot tell (ſaid ſhe) what beauty there is in me: but I am moſt ſure, that I could never love him. Cannot you tell what beauty there is in you, ſaid I? then you cannot tell what all the world doth ſee; but, perhaps it is only your modeſty, which makes you ſeem ignorant of it. No, no, ſaid ſhe, I do really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that there is nothing in my face which can merit that name you give it: But, be it what it will, pray let's talk no more of it, for more would be out of ſeaſon, and little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting. I ſhall obey you, ſaid I unto her, but it ſhall be with this proteſtation then, that I will never ſpeak again what I think, and what you have forbidden to be in my mouth, ſhall as long as I live reſt in my heart. We had diſcourſed longer, had not the company
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53526:130"/>
called us away, for they were already gone into the Barge. Then ſhe roſe up without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any anſwer, and putting her flowers in a corner of her Gown, I took her hand, and conducted her to her company, where not daring to revive the diſcourſe which we left, leſt I ſhould be too bold (for ſo much forwardneſſe in the firſt declaration of Love, is a ſigne of but little affection) I contented my ſelfe at this time with what I had already ſaid. At laſt, the generall genius of the company was all for ſinging, and when it came to my turn, I ſung theſe enſuing Verſes, to aſſure <hi>Florice,</hi> that all which I had ſaid, was true.</p>

               </lg>
               <p>Thus, fair <hi>Phillis,</hi> was a good foundation laid; for, ſince the very firſt time I ſaw <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,</hi> it was impoſſible for me to make a retreat; yet it angred me, that I ſhould loſe <hi>Pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> as well becauſe I was obliged unto her, as becauſe ſhe was really a woman of much merit. Moreover, the love of <hi>Cercenea</hi> much grieved me; for this young Beauty being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended ſhe ſleighted all the reaſons I could bring in to convince her. However, though ſhe did not love me, yet it vext her to ſee, that <hi>Florice</hi> ſhould have a more abſolute power over me, then ever ſhe could have, thinking this to be an argument, of her being inferiour in beauty: And this was the reaſon why ſhe did me all the ill offices ſhe could both to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linice</hi> and <hi>Florice.</hi> But ſo it hapned, that her malice did me no harm, but did more for me, then all my ſervices perhaps of a long time could have done; for <hi>Florice</hi> preſently found, that <hi>Cercenea,</hi> did ſpeak it out of a paſſionate partiality, and therefore ſhe gave no credit unto her: And on the contrary, conſidering and obſerving my actions more neerly, ſhe began to finde them agreeable, and by little and little to pleaſe her; ſo as Love, like a ſlie and ſubtle ſpie, did inſenſibly inſinuate himſelfe into her ſoul. However, I being very deſirous to keep my ſelfe in <hi>Palinice's</hi> favour, I was a little vexed.</p>
               <p>But learn this from me, <hi>Silvander,</hi> (ſaid he, and turned towards that Shepheard) that there is none whom women eſteem more, then thoſe who are in love with them. Nor none whom they more deſpiſe, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> then thoſe that leave them, and love another. But upon this conſideration, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> I endeavoured to keep fair with all, if it was poſſible, but all in vain; for <hi>Florice</hi> was too full of vanitie, and had too over good an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53526:130"/>
of her own merits, to entertain a heart in which any other had a ſhare. And this proud ſoul reſolving to be ſole Miſtreſſe and to love none but me, ſhe did one day do me ſo much favour, as to aſſurence of her love. But, ſaid I unto her, what ſhall we do with <hi>Theombres,</hi> (thinking to upbraid her with him)? She preſently anſwered me in my own element. Let us give him unto <hi>Palinice.</hi> I underſtood her meaning well enough and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſwore unto her never to love any but <hi>Florice</hi> and that if ſhe would baniſh <hi>Theom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi> out of her ſight, I would promiſe her, never to look upon <hi>Palinice</hi> again. Nor becauſe you deſire it, ſaid ſhe but becauſe he does extreamly diſpleaſe me, I will ſwear and proteſt unto you, that I will never love him, and that if it were handſome, I would baniſh him out of my ſight; for when you conſider that action well, you will finde it to be a greater wound unto me, then it can be ſatisfaction unto you. Since this time, ſhe gave her ſelfe wholly unto me, and I, contrary to my own nature, did give my ſelfe wholly unto her, and declined all others. From morning untill night I never ſtirred out of her lodging: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſhe went; and if any came upon viſits, they muſt be perſons of great eminency, if they did interrupt our diſcourſe. At every word, I was in her mouth, and ſhe in mine, and we could not ſpeak, unleſſe the one called the other as a witneſſe. Judge yet, whether <hi>Pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> and <hi>Cercenea</hi> had not enough to talk off. This was the reaſon, why all the Town made it their common talk; and reports alwaies encreaſing by going, they went ſo much in diſadvantage of <hi>Florices</hi> honour, that at laſt they came to her ears, by a friend who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her. She repented her ſelfe of the imprudent carriage of the buſineſſe, though too late: She acquainted me and told me, that we muſt be more circumſpect in our expreſſions of good will; and the better to hide it for the future ſhe willed me not to come unto her, but at night, and ſo give a ſtop unto reports if it were poſſible. To give her ſatisfaction, I refrained comming for a while; but becauſe ſhe was as much diſpleaſed with the depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my company, as I of hers, it was reſolved betwixt us, to finde out ſome way or other, to avoid the cenſure of the world, and yet be together. After conſideration ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed me to ſeem as if I loved ſome, who uſed to be familiarly with her, and under that ſhaddow, I might come unto her: And upon ſerious thoughts, none deemed more fit for this purpoſe then <hi>Dorinde,</hi> as well, becauſe ſhe was her coſen, and frequently familiar, as becauſe ſhe was fair, though not very ſubtle: And though ſhe was not ſo fair as <hi>Florice,</hi> nor ſo rich, nor ſo well deſcended; yet, ſhe did excell the moſt, both in beauty and merit. The day that I declared my ſelfe <hi>Dorinde's</hi> ſervant, was that, upon which the people ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated a Feaſt, in memory of the reſtauration and building of their Town by <hi>Nero,</hi> after that moſt terrible fire, which in one night conſumed it to the ground. At this time of publick joy, every one did ſtrive to appear as fine as poſſibly they could, as well to aſſiſt at the ſacrifices offered unto <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the Reſtaurator, and to the Titular gods, as to be ſeen in the Theaters and publick Shewes. <hi>Dorinde,</hi> deſirous to be ſeen and obſerved, did ſet out her beauty with all the illuſtrations that Art could deviſe. Before the day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I did ſo accoſt <hi>Dorinde</hi> with my expreſſions of that affection I had unto her, that ſhe did believe them. At that time and day, I became acquainted with a young Cavalier called <hi>Periander,</hi> a man indeed full of civility, diſcretion, and ſweetneſſe: This man ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me ſo obſequious to <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and finding my humour agreeable unto his own, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make me his friend: And I, on the other ſide, being deſirous of acquaintance in that place, where I intended to ſtay, ſince Love did ſo oblige me to it; I thought him to be a man of merit, and therefore was glad to have him my friend. This encounter of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which proceeded from one and the ſame ſympatheticall cauſe, was ſooner contracted betwixt him and me, then betwixt me and <hi>Dorinde,</hi> although <hi>Florice,</hi> the better to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe her own love, did contribute all that poſſibly ſhe could unto it: But poor <hi>Florice</hi> did not foreſee, how ſhe was ſharpning a ſword which gave her a deep wound ſhe did not know, how it was alwaies my humour, never to ſee any Beauty, but I muſt needs love her a little; ſo as ere I was aware, I was in Love with <hi>Dorinde</hi> as well as with <hi>Florice:</hi> yet, I did love <hi>Florice</hi> better, ſhe being more fair, and of a higher rank. Two months were ſpent in this manner, and the friendſhip betwixt <hi>Periander</hi> and me grew to that height, that we were commonly called the two Friends; and becauſe we both deſired a continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, we took reciprocall oathes, of a moſt faithfull and perfect friendſhip, calling the gods to witneſſe to the oath which we had taken, and to be puniſhers of him, who ſhould violate the Lawes of friendſhip. After this proteſtation, nothing was in the ſoul of one, but it was diſcovered unto the other. It hapned one morning (for commonly we lay both together) after much diſcourſe upon the Beauties of the Town, he asked me, whether
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53526:131"/>
there was any of them which I loved: And anſwering him; Yes: He told me, that before he would ask me who my Miſtreſſe was, he would tell me who was his I deſire, ſaid I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, to be the firſt in that freedome, becauſe you were the firſt that asked the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. Then I related unto him all the addreſſes which I had made unto <hi>Dorinde,</hi> ſince the laſt two months, but would not by any means mention <hi>Florice,</hi> as well, becauſe I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her more and deſired that that Love ſhould be kept ſecret, as becauſe I knew that one of his conſens did court her in Marriage. As ſoon as I had named <hi>Dorinde:</hi> How, (ſaid he) do you love <hi>Dorinde? Dorinde,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Arcingentorix.</hi> The very ſame, ſaid I; and I do aſſure you, that I have courted her above this ſix months. Oh heavens! cried he, how cruelly doth love treat me? And after he had pauſed a while; I do ſwear, ſaid he, and proteſt, that it is ſhe whom I have long loved. Could a greater misfortune befall me! I had rather die then retreat, and if I continue, I ſhall offend againſt the Lawes of Amitie. I was much aſtoniſhed to hear him ſay thus; for, though I loved him, yet it went againſt my heart to leave <hi>Dorinde</hi> unto whom Love had kindled new deſires in me: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, after I had held my eyes up to heaven, as one that was much troubled, I ſaid thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: Brother, ſince our Loves did begin in us before our Friendſhip, it argues a ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy in our humours, which forceth us to love the ſame; but however, let the Lawes of Friendſhip be inviolable; ſince we have thus far agreed, let our prudence endeavour to continue ſo for the future; and in order to that, let us ſee whom this Lady moſt affects: To think that our friendſhip ſhould make us quit her the one unto the other, this would be rather tyranny then friendſhip; and to think, that we can continue Rivalls and Friends, is Folly. What then ſhould we do? Let us refer all to Reaſon, and ſee which of us ſhe loves moſt. Tell me, I do conjure you by the Oath which we have taken, whether it be true, that ſhe doth love you, and what teſtimonies of it ſhe hath given you? I do ſwear, Brother, (anſwered he) that I will not tell you a lie, either in this, or any thing you ſhall ask, I will firſt die a hundred deaths. Know then, that it is impoſſible I ſhould give you any aſſurance that ſhe loves me, ſince her diſcretion and modeſty keeps all cloſe in her own ſoul: Then (ſaid I unto him) ſince we are both in one condition, let us ſwear by our friendſhip one unto another, and call all the divinities to puniſh moſt rigorouſly the perjured, that he who can obtain moſt affection from her and give a teſtimony of it unto the other, he ſhall only enjoy her: By this means we ſhall not offend againſt the Lawes of Friendſhip it being moſt reaſonable, that he whom ſhe loves moſt, ſhould enjoy her, and the other quit her. I conceive your Propoſition to be very juſt, (ſaid <hi>Periander)</hi> and I ſwear by all the gods not to ſwerve from it.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you, generous <hi>Paris,</hi> conſider the Natures of moſt men. Before <hi>Periander</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his affection unto me I did love <hi>Dorinde;</hi> but much leſſe then ſince: And as a fire is augmented by the agitation of the winde; ſo my affection was much more violent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppoſed by the affection of <hi>Periander.</hi> This was the reaſon, why I devoted my ſelfe unto her more then before. But having ſpent ſome daies in courting her without effect, and fearing that <hi>Periander</hi> being of that Town, and having many kindred of good rank, ſhould make a farther progreſſe into her favour then my ſelfe. I reſolved to uſe the ſubtlety of the Fox, where the ſtrength of a Lion would not prevail: I had recourſe then unto Policie, thinking that in Love, ſubtleties were lawfull and juſt. I cauſed a little Mirror to be made, no bigger then the plain of my hand, but as rich as poſſibly Art could make it, both in the curioſity of the Gold work, and in the Enamell, which added much to the value and beauty; afterwards I put my own Picture, which was drawn to the life, between the Glaſſe, and the table of Gold which held it; ſo as when the Mirror was opened, nothing could be ſeen but the Glaſſe and work about it. Afterwards I went to an old woman, who got her living, by carrying Jewells and other pieces of curioſity, unto private houſes to ſell; and told her, that I deſired to turn this Mirror into Money, and therefore ſhe would do me a great pleaſure, if ſhe could ſell it for me. She promiſed, ſhe would do her beſt. But I told her, that I had preſent uſe of money, and would let it go at any reaſonable rate. She anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me, that things done in haſte were never well done; but ſtill ſhe would do her endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. So ſhe went away with my Mirror, yet, ſhe was no ſooner gone out of my lodging, but I ſent for her back, and told her, that my occaſions were ſo preſſing, as if ſhe could but get halfe the worth, or leſſe, ſhe ſhould let it go; but adviſed her, before ſhe went any whither elſe, to carry it into the houſe of <hi>Arcingentorix:</hi> I know, ſaid I unto her that he hath a Daughter whom he loves very well, perhaps he will be glad of ſuch a preſent for her. Indeed, anſwered the woman, I did intend to offer it unto him before any other,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:53526:131"/>
becauſe it was long ſince I was at that houſe Go then, ſaid I unto her, and before you car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it any whither elſe, let me know what the Father or the Daughter will give for it. I will not trouble you with all the goings and commings of this woman: but ſo it was, that my plot took effect, and <hi>Dorinde</hi> bought it, as well for its curioſity of workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as for the cheapneſſe; not giving the third part of the worth for it. Things being thus ordered about five or ſix daies after, I ſaw it hanging by her ſide, and ſhe making very much of it. Then I thought it requiſite to accompliſh my plot as ſoon as I could; for it was to be feared, that becauſe the glaſſe was ſo extreamly thin and fragil, it might break, and then my picture would be ſeen; to prevent which danger, I went unto <hi>Perian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and asked him, Whether he had any thing advanced himſelfe into <hi>Dorinde's</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour? To which he very ingenuouſly anſwered, That he was not one jot more in her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, than the firſt day he ſaw her, that he knew not whether he ſhould accuſe her Nature, or his deficiency in Merit, or his hard Fortune; yet, all his contentment was, that he ſaw ſhe treated him as well as any other. No, no, Brother, ſaid I unto him, do not accuſe your own Merits, not the Nature of <hi>Dorinde;</hi> for your Merits are much above your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; nor is ſhe inſenſible of Love's Darts; but that affection which poſſeſſeth her, is the cauſe of all this coldneſſe, both towards you and all others: And to ſhew you your errour, though I know it will vex you at the firſt, yet I will tell you the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Believe it, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (ſaid I and embraced him) that I am in ſuch poſſeſſion of her, as ſhe cannot ſee but with my eyes. The truth is, I did never in all my life meet with ſo cloſe and ſo diſcreet a Lover as ſhe is; for ſhe is ſo afraid her paſſion ſhould be known, as ſhe will not in publick ſo much as look upon me, unleſſe forced unto it by the Lawes of civility; but, when we are in private, if you did but ſee how paſſionately ſhe does carraſſe me, you would admire the ſtrange command ſhe hath over her ſelfe, in not making demonſtrations of it any where elſe. And to the end you ſhould not think this to be a forged tale, I will give you ſuch certain knowledge, as ſhall undoubtedly aſſure you of all I ſay. But, I do conjure you, by all the ſacred Lawes of Friendſhip, (ſince what I ſhall tell you, is only to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you) that you do never diſcover me, for it will nothing at all profit you, but may ruine me in her opinion. Then vowing he would not, I continued; Did you never take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a Mirror (ſaid I unto him) which of late daies ſhe hath worn by her ſide? And he anſwering, Yes. Then know (ſaid I unto him) ſhe weares it for my ſake, and the love of me. Now, to put you out of all doubt, the firſt time you ſee her, take out the glaſſe, and then take out a little paper which is between the glaſſe and it, and you ſhall finde my Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. There is no queſtion, but ſhe will be very ſorry that you ſaw it; but however, my friendſhip obligeth me to diſcover this ſecret unto you, rather then let you run on in your errour. <hi>Periander</hi> hearing this, ſtood as if immovable, and ſtared, as if he had ſeen the face of <hi>Meduſa:</hi> But after he had conſidered upon what I ſaid, he concluded, that if it was ſo, then he would quit her unto me, and abſolutely fall off. And to know the truth, ſaid he, though I do not ſuſpect your words, yet, I would go out of her ſervice, by letting her know the cauſe, ſo as ſhe ſhould not accuſe me of levitie. So he went immediately unto her lodging, where he found <hi>Dorinde</hi> by her ſelf, who ſtayed at home to entertain two La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which intended a viſit unto her. She, who did really love <hi>Periander</hi> better then all thoſe that courted her, did yet make very little ſhew of it; and as ſoon as ſhe ſaw him, ſhe went to meet him, according to her accuſtomed ſweetneſſe and civility. But he, who came with a bad opinion of her, and conceiving all her kindneſſes to be but diſſimulations, he began to look upon her and all her actions with diſdain. Almoſt as ſoon as he, theſe expected Ladies came alſo, but went preſently away again. <hi>Periander</hi> could not chuſe but wonder at her freeneſſe to him and all others: But having no minde to carry any longer in a place, where he thought him ſelfe ſo unworthily treated and betrayed, he would ſee, whether all that was ſaid was true; and therefore took the Mirror in his hand, ſeeming as if he much admired it; and as he offered to take out the Glaſſe, it broke, at which he ſtarted, as if it had been done by chance, and ſeeing the glaſſe broken: Miſtreſs, ſaid he, I beg your pardon, I am obliged to make amends, and put in another Glaſs. She anſwered him, that it was a ſmall matter, and not worth the pains; upon this word, ſhe held out her hand to take it again; but he, thinking that ſhe would not let him have it, leſt he ſhould ſee the Picture in it, he was the more backward in reſtoring it: and in this diſpute, he took out the Glaſs, then the paper, and then he found what I had ſaid was true. Although he did believe me before, yet when he ſaw my Picture, he was ſo ſurpriſed, that he could not ſpeak of a long time; and the amazement of <hi>Dorinde</hi> was no leſs. <hi>Periander,</hi> who ſtood
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:53526:132"/>
mute, looking ſometimes upon the Picture, and ſometimes upon <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and conſidering her amazement alſo, had an opinion, that ſhe only ſeemed ſo, to be thought ignorant of it; therefore he was extreamly tranſported with anger: Let me tell you, ſaid he unto her, that both in well loving, in ſecreſy, and in diſſimulation, you are the moſt admirable, that ever I knew. <hi>Periander,</hi> ſaid ſhe, I do proteſt by all that's ſacred, that I am ignorant of it. Take heed, ſaid he, how you invoke things that are ſacred; but, ſince you are not the firſt whoſe humour hath deceived me, I will leave the place to another, that I may have ſo much contentment, as not to be the laſt whom you will deceive. Upon this, he went away in an extream fury. <hi>Dorinde</hi> did all ſhe could to undeceive him, but that did more augment his opinion of her diſſimulation. Thus he left her, and to obſerve the Lawes of friendſhip, he reſolved upon Travell, not knowing any better way to overcome Love then abſence, which yet would not do, as I ſhall tell you afterwards.</p>
               <p>Now look upon me as arrived at the port of my deſigne, having the place free unto my ſelfe. But Oh! generous <hi>Paris,</hi> when I went to ſee <hi>Dorinde,</hi> Oh how ſhe was diſpleaſed at me? She had ſent for her who ſold her the Mirror, and forced her to confeſſe of whom ſhe had it; and finding it to be my ſelfe, I cannot expreſſe unto you the greatneſſe of her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: Perfidious Impoſtor (ſaid ſhe unto me) why would you ſo mortally offend one, that never gave you any. occaſion for it? How durſt you, after ſo great an injury, be ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as to come in my ſight? I had before han I prepared my ſelfe for a chiding, yet could not endure it without a bluſh; but knowing, that the only way to ſtop an impetuous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of fury, was, to let her juſt anger cool a little, before I gave any anſwer; therefore I ſtayed mute untill ſhe had vented all ſhe had to ſay, and then I anſwered her thus: I muſt needs confeſſe, that all your reproaches are juſt; but alas, I cannot complain againſt you for it, only againſt Love, who having inflamed my ſoul towards you, did freez yours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me. Had Love been juſt, it would in ſome ſort have cooled my too ardent affection, and then I ſhould not have been forced to offend you, and needed not have uſed any tricks, to drive away my Rivall from you. But alas I ſee that I am a very Noviſt in Love, ſince I look for any reaſon in any thing it doth. But for all that, fair <hi>Dorinde,</hi> you do me wrong in complaining againſt my actions, ſince being but effects of Love, yet you ſhould expect them to be ſquared according to any rules of Reaſon. I muſt confeſſe, that I have ſinned againſt the rules of Reaſon, but not againſt Love; and I beſeech you take me not as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, but as amorous, and moſt extreamly wounded with the darts of Love.</p>
               <p>I expreſſed the extremity of my affection with ſo much dejected humility, and paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate language, as it had a good melting influence upon her ſoul, ſo as within a few daies after, ſhe began to ſmile upon me, and pardon my offence; and ſee how an ill chance is ſometimes profitable, for that which was the cauſe of her anger, was it which augmented her good will unto me: and conſidering the artifice which I had uſed, ſhe had an opinion that I did moſt certainly love her. And this conſideration cauſed <hi>Thcombres</hi> to miſſe his Miſtreſſe; for ſhe devoted her ſelfe wholly unto me, ſo as it may ſeem, that I did love her only to make her hate him: And yet for all this, I loved <hi>Florice</hi> much more then I did <hi>Dorinde:</hi> Truth is, that when <hi>Dorinde's</hi> favours did flow more then uſuall upon me, I did begin to love her more; for nothing doth kindle affection and augment it ſo much, as favours.</p>
               <p>Living then thus ambodexterouſly with <hi>Florice</hi> and <hi>Dorinde, Florice</hi> began to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome ſuſpition of me, and the common brute of this affection was blown all over: Therefore one day ſhe ſpoke unto me as if ſhe were quite altered; and I, who did really love her, did vow and ſwear, that all my courtſhip of <hi>Dorinde,</hi> was but an effect of her own command to cover thereby my affection unto her: That if ſhe would, I would never look upon <hi>Dorinde</hi> again, and told her, that if ſhe would but look her ſelfe in a glaſſe, and look upon <hi>Dorinde,</hi> that ſight would give her better aſſurance of my ſervice and affection, then all my words could. To be brief, with good language I brought her into a good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of me; yet I was forced to promiſe, that I would give her all the Letters which <hi>Dorinde</hi> writ unto me. Take heed, ſaid ſhe unto me, leſt you ſhould promiſe and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, for that would for ever loſe me, if I come to know it. I will never fail in any thing I promiſe (ſaid I unto her) and much leſſe unto <hi>Florice,</hi> then unto the gods. Thus were we upon better termes then ever. And becauſe none was ſo dear unto me as <hi>Florice,</hi> yet had I a corner in my heart for <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and was much delighted in her company; ſhe conferred many favours upon me, and I courted her ſo cloſe with ſeverall Letters, that ſhe anſwered me in Letters again, which I preſently carried unto <hi>Florice,</hi> who read them, and kept them carefully.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:53526:132"/>
                  <hi>Hylas</hi> ſeeing <hi>Silvander</hi> ſit neer <hi>Diana,</hi> and whiſpering, then laughed together, he broke off his diſcourſe, to anſwer what he had a conceit they ſaid. I believe you laugh, <hi>Silvander,</hi> ſaid he unto him, at my loving <hi>Florice,</hi> and yet held correſpondency with <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinde.</hi> If I do meet, in my way unto the happineſſe of <hi>Florice,</hi> with any delights in the converſation of <hi>Dorinde,</hi> do I contradict the Lawes of reaſon, if I do receive them? Should I refuſe that good which the gods do ſend me, and which your unnaturall auſterity diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowes? Now becauſe <hi>Silvander</hi> would be no interruption, he would not return an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: And <hi>Hylas</hi> ſeeing him ſilent, after he had ſhook his head, he fell into the diſcourſe from which he had digreſſed.</p>
               <p>See now, ſaid he, the iſſue of theſe Loves; the frequent converſation which I had with <hi>Dorinde,</hi> began to encreaſe my love unto her the more. And in as much as the conferring of one favour drawes on another, that is greater, ſo ſhe did every day give me cleerer evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of her love, which was a cauſe, that our Letters began to alter ſtyle, and became more affectionate and paſſionate then uſuall. This was a reaſon, why I gave them unto <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> but ſeldome, and then only thoſe which had feweſt expreſſions of affection, and crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept the reſt to my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thus I lived for a while in a ſea of delights, being welcome unto both; but it was too high to hold, and this happineſſe did not laſt long: For it hapned one day, that as I pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſome things out of my pocket, in the preſence of <hi>Florice</hi> and other company, ſhe eſpied two or three little Letters, lapped up after the very ſame manner as <hi>Dorinde's</hi> were, which I had given unto her: She began preſently to ſuſpect the truth, and many daies paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and I not giving them unto her, ſhe concluded her ſelfe to be deluded, and reſolved to ſteal them from me; and becauſe I took no notice, ſhe eaſily got them out of my pocket, whilſt I was talking unto others, who did what they could to abuſe me, and give her a better opportunity to play the thief, thinking ſhe did it only to make me ſeek them. She took them out ſo dexterouſly, that I perceived not; ſhe went away immediately, and was no ſooner come unto her lodging, but locking her ſelfe up in her cloſet, ſhe threw them all upon the Table, and found five; ſome very freſhly written, and others of a longer date. The firſt ſhe took, which was laſt writ, contained theſe words.</p>

               <p>Then throwing this Letter upon the Table with an angry look, and puſhing away the reſt further from her, ſhe went back a pace or two. Then folding her armes, and lifting up her eyes: Oh heavens! ſaid ſhe, can this poſſibly be true? Haſt then betrayed me, <hi>Hylas?</hi> Couldſt thou ſo long fool me, and I never ſee thy treaſon? Then ſtanding ſilent a long while, at laſt, ſhe ſtruck both her hands upon the Table, and ſaid: Well Traitor, thou ſhalt not paſſe unpuniſhed, I will diſcover thee unto her whom thou haſt betrayed as well as me, and perhaps we ſhall both grow a little wiſer by thy follies. She had no ſooner fixed upon this reſolution, but ſhe lapt up all her Letters, and went to <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and deſired her to go into her Cloſet, and then ſhutting the dore: Sweet coſen (ſaid ſhe unto her) I am come to manifeſt my affection unto you; but upon condition, that when I have diſcovered a ſecret unto you, that you do prudently conceal it. I know that <hi>Hylas</hi> hath long courted you, and that you have long thought he loved you; but I come now out of my true affection to you to undeceive you, and to let you ſee, that he hath deceived you.

No, no, ſaid <hi>Florice,</hi> do not think, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, to hide that, which I do know better then your ſelfe: I ſay, better; for you only know your own intentions, and not his, but I do know both.

                  </gap> from this man, who courts you only to get ſuch favours from you as he brags of. There hath been heretofore ſome familiarity betwixt him and me, and that is the reaſon (which you have reaſon to be glad of) that he hath addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelfe unto me. I do not think you ever ſpoke one ſyllable unto him, which he hath not told me; and becauſe it would be too long to repeat them, ſee here moſt of the Letters you have written unto him, which you may do well to burn, leſt he ſhould make uſe of them hereafter to your diſadvantage. <hi>Dorinde</hi> both ſeeing and knowing them, ſhe did ingenuouſly confeſſe, that ſhe did believe I loved her, and therefore thought her ſelfe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged unto what ſhe did; but, for the future, ſhe would hate me a thouſand times more then ever ſhe loved me: She thought her ſelfe infinitely obliged unto <hi>Florice,</hi> for this diſcovery, and commended her for the beſt friend in the world. Then both of them began to inveigh againſt me with all poſſible bitterneſſe, eſpecially <hi>Dorinde</hi> who thought her ſelfe the moſt offended. <hi>Florice</hi> having revenged her ſelfe upon me according to her deſires, returned unto her lodging, fully reſolved never to love me again, no, nor ever to ſee me again if it were poſſible: But, when the heat of her anger was a little cooled, and when ſhe began to recall into her memory the diſcourſe which <hi>Dorinde</hi> and ſhe had, ſhe remembered, that what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſoever I had unto <hi>Dorinde,</hi> yet I had never acquainted her with the affection I had unto <hi>Florice,</hi> nor of any favour I ever received from her; concluding from hence, that I loved her more then I did <hi>Dorinde,</hi> ſo as ſhe began to repent of what ſhe had don; for ſhe did believe, that if I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> diſcourſed any thing concerning her, ſhe ſhould certainly have heard of it upon this occaſion. The more this came into her minde, the more ſhe repented of her too much haſte, or, ſaid ſhe, what though he did viſit her? I my ſelfe was the cauſe: If he did court her, I did command him ſo to do: If he did love her, it was, becauſe ſhe was amiable: If he did receive her favours, it was the better to cloak that affection which he bore unto me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the truth is, being young, very few of his age would have refuſed ſuch a fortune. If he did diſſemble with me and not ſhewe me how much he was favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it was, becauſe he thought I ſhould be angry at it; and all men of reputation, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the honour of thoſe who do oblige them, but moſt certainly he loved me more then her, ſince he never ſpoke of our affection. Theſe thoughts made her condemne what ſhe had done, and extreamly repent of the fault which ſhe had committed, and earneſtly deſire a reconciliation.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, <hi>Dorinde</hi> juſtly incenſed againſt me, and ſwelling with anger, after a flood of tears, flowing upon her cheeks and breaſt, ſhe went into her Cloſet, and vented all the bitterneſſe and animoſity that her ſorrowes could inſpire into her tongue: And as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was, juſt as ſhe was wiping the tears from her eyes, I came to her houſe, and when ſhe heard me walking, ſhe ran and pulled to the dore, which ſhe had left open when <hi>Florice</hi> went out, and which, her minde being upon other things, ſhe had forgot to ſhut; yet, ſhe could not do it ſo ſuddenly, but I ſaw how red her eyes were with crying; and when I wondred, both at her tears, and that ſhe ſhould deny me entrance, ſhe opened her Cloſet, and ſtanding in the dore: Perfidious Traitor (ſaid ſhe, and called me by my name) are you come with any deſignes of injury unto me?</p>
               <p>And becauſe I anſwered nothing, being ſo ſurpriſed that I could not ſpeak: Perhaps, ungratefull wretch, ſaid ſhe, you will deny your villany? Ah moſt wicked perſon! (ſaid ſhe, and ſhewed me her Letters, here are all the teſtimonies of my too eaſy beliefe; but know that there is not one of thy treaſons which is not known unto me; and be certain, that thou haſt made me forever thy moſt mortall enemy. Then ſhe puſhed me out of the dore and ſhut it ſo ſuddenly, that I could not hinder her. Thus, faireſt Miſtris, ſeeing ſhe would not open the dore, I went away the moſt aſhamed man in the world, but ſo incenſed againſt <hi>Florice,</hi> that revenged I would be at what rate ſoever; for it was ſhe, I knew, that took my Letters, &amp; I ſaw it was ſhe that gave them unto <hi>Dorinde,</hi> purpoſely to diſpleaſe me. I did imagine, that it was envie or jealouſie, which made her commit this crime againſt our amity; and conceiving, that nothing would more vex her, then to ſeem, as if I had quitted her for <hi>Dorinde,</hi> I reſolved to break off entirely with her, and devote my ſelfe wholly unto the other. The greateſt difficulty was, to appeaſe <hi>Dorinde;</hi> but I armed my ſelfe with a full reſolution, to endure all manner of diſdain and anger, rather than not be revenged upon <hi>Florice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Within a few daies after, I went in this deſigne, unto <hi>Dorinde</hi> in her Cloſet; for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:53526:133"/>
which ſhe had received, made her more retired then uſuall; and offering to ſhut the dore upon me, I fell down upon my knees ſo ſuddenly, as ſhe could not avoid me; then, after I had begged a thouſand times for a pardon, I told her all the truth; to wit, how <hi>Florice</hi> having long loved me, and to keep our affections more ſecret, ſhe commanded me to faigne a courtſhip of her; which accordingly I did, both at the firſt, and when I gave her all thoſe Letters; but afterwards, comming to love her in good earneſt, I then gave <hi>Florice</hi> no more. Oh! yar, ſaid ſhe unto me did you not carry her the laſt which I writ al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo? 'Tis true, (ſaid he) that ſhe hath them, but ſhe ſtole them from me; and if you will not believe me, ask of thoſe who helped her to play the thiefe. Then I named two, who had ſeen her ſteal them, and told me of it; and therefore, when <hi>Florice</hi> ſound her ſelfe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by her own invention, ſhe acquainted you with all that could break off your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from me. But is not Love juſt, in making her ſuffer that harm which ſhe prepared for you? Why ſhould ſhe make your beauty the cloak for all her deſignes? May the gods never be favourable unto me, if I do not hate ſuch things moſt abominably, and if I do not love you above all the world, and into whoſe favour I do deſire moſt to ingratiate my ſelfe. Let not her jealouſie and ſlander of me, have a greater influence upon you, then my affection hath, and let not her anger, at my diſdaining her for you, prejudice me in your good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. I uſed many ſuch expreſſions, which at the firſt did not operate according to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and expectance; but ſo diſpoſed her, that when I made the theft of <hi>Florice</hi> manifeſt unto her, ſhe would pardon me: And preſently after, we renewed love upon ſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>icter obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then ever before, which took me off from <hi>Florice</hi> as much, as if I had never ſeen her; and I did it without any conſtraint: for it is moſt true, ſhe was fairer then <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and of a higher rank and quality; yet, my anger againſt her had ſo changed my eyes, as this Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty did not at all pleaſe them, but made me ſleight her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florice</hi> for a while did endure all this, ſeeming not to care a jot what became of me, as if all my actions were very indifferent unto her but at length ſhe repented, and extreamly grieved that ſhe had ſo loſt me; and being aſſured, that I did once love her alſo thinking, that a reall affection could not ſo eaſily extinguiſh, ſhe conceived, that if ſhe did ſeem, as if ſhe loved ſome other, doubtleſſe it would have ſo much influence upon me, as would make me return again unto her: And in order to this deſigne, ſhe could not think of any more fit to fool then <hi>Theombres,</hi> becauſe ſhe thought his diſpoſition was amorouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, and becauſe he had formerly loved her. Then ſhe began to carraſſe <hi>Theombres</hi> with all imaginable expreſſions, and ſhew, as if all he ſaid or did, did pleaſe her eſpecially when I was within compaſſe of taking any notice, and then ſhe would talk to him, and whiſper, as if ſhe had made choice of him, for the only Cabinet of all her ſecrets. I preſently obſerved this redintegration, and told <hi>Dorinde,</hi> who could not chuſe but laugh, when ſhe heard how <hi>Theombres</hi> was embarqued. <hi>Florice</hi> ſeeing I did not return unto her according to her expectance, did the more multiply her favours upon him, inſomuch as many did diſlike her behaviour, and acquainted her Parents with it; for, ſhe was ſo free and open in the diſpenſation of her favours, as in lieu of hiding them, as is uſuall, ſhe expoſed them to the view of every one, nay, ſtudied how to make them ſeen, otherwiſe I had not come to the knowledge of it for I never ſaw her but in publick, and when I was with her in any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick place, I ſhunned her. Now her Father, as I have told you, being advertiſed of this Love, did exceedingly reprehend her, and much more her Mother, who for honour and chaſtity was an eminent example to all the Country. At the firſt, ſh<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> would have gloſſed the matter with an excuſe; but afterwards, ſeeing excuſes would not do it, ſhe did confeſſe it, and ſaid, that it was true, <hi>Theombres</hi> did court her, and that ſhe could not chuſe but love him. But her Mother, who could not upon any termes approve of her behaviour, did tell her in a very angry manner, That <hi>Theombres</hi> did not give ſo many teſtimonies of his love to her, as ſhe of her love to him. To which <hi>Florice,</hi> in much diſorder anſwered, That <hi>Theombres</hi> did court her in the way of honour; and ſince his End was only at Marriage, ſhe could do no leſſe then allow of him. If it be ſo, ſaid her Father, let him acquaint us with his intentions, otherwiſe we ſhall think, you only invented this, thereby to excuſe your ſelfe. She, who had a very reverentiall reſpect and fear of her Father and Mother, and who beſides, had ever lived in great reputation, did think it expedient, that <hi>Theom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi> ſhould make ſome overtures of Marriage unto her Parents, yet not intending to go any further, then a meer motion; for ſhe hoped, that it might be eaſily broken off: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe ſpoke unto <hi>Theombres</hi> concerning it, who was joyed at it beyond all expreſſions; and not to loſe a minute of time, he entreated two of his Uncles to make the motion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:53526:134"/>
                  <hi>Florice's</hi> Father and Mother; which accordingly they did, with ſo many fair offers, as they were received as well as they could deſire; for he was very rich, and an advantageous Match unto <hi>Florice,</hi> which being known and conſidered by her Parents, they would not prolong time, but did conclude the Marriage that ſame day, and the more willingly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believed it agreeable unto the liking of their Daughter. Thus is <hi>Florice's</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with <hi>Theombres</hi> made up, all things agreed upon, Writings ſealed, and nothing wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but a Prieſt to Marry them. But Oh! what a wonder was all this unto <hi>Florice,</hi> when ſhe heard of it? Her Father thinking ſhe would be very glad of it, would himſelfe be the meſſenger of the newes: But, when he told her how all things went, though ſhe would have faigned, yet ſhe could not, but broke out into a deluge of tears, at which her Father was much amazed: How, Daughter, ſaid he unto her, this is very ſtrange; does <hi>Florice</hi> cry at what ſhe her ſelfe deſired? I told you, Father (ſaid <hi>Florice</hi> all in tears) that <hi>Theombres</hi> courted me in way of Marriage, but I never told you, that I did deſire it. Were not you the cauſe, ſaid the Father, which moved <hi>Theombres</hi> to make the motion? It was upon your command, replied ſhe, and not upon my own deſire; and I did believe, you would have given me ſome time to conſider upon it. Come, come, (ſaid he in an angry manner) you knew well enough how ſuch buſineſſes uſe to be carried. Reſolve with your ſelfe, that ſince they have gone thus far, they ſhall go on. What! would you be further courted, and give all the world an occaſion to talk of you? Would you have further time, to make me more aſhamed? No, no, <hi>Florice,</hi> content your ſelfe, I have bluſh'd enough for you already, when your friends acquainted me with your behaviour, and I will prevent it for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture if I can. Upon this, he left her alone, and went to his Wife, who hearing what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe had paſſed, came to her with all the ſharp language which ſhe could invent, and for a concluſion told her, that nothing but death could hinder that Marriage from taking effect, and therefore ſhe muſt reſolve upon it. Thus, poor <hi>Florice</hi> was in a worſe condition than ever; for, ſhe had not only loſt me whom ſhe loved, but was likely to be enjoyed by another, whom ſhe loved not, but hated worſe then a death. Imagine in what a wilderneſſe of thoughts ſhe was and what various combats was in her ſoul: In concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhe reſolved, that death ſhould be the remedy againſt all her reſtleſſe afflictions; not that ſhe had ſo much courage as to kill her ſelfe, (for the thought of ſuch a cruelty made her to tremble) but becauſe ſhe thought her life was not able to endure ſo many ſad and tormenting miſeries. But ſee the ſtrange conſequents of Love; ſhe did not ſo much grieve for the loſſe of me, and at her being anothers whom ſhe loved not, as to think, that I ſhould put a bad conſtruction upon that affection which ſhe expreſſed unto me: For, though ſhe was angry at me, becauſe of <hi>Dorinde;</hi> yet, ſhe did love me, and excuſed me for loving her no more, accuſing her ſelfe with the offence which ſhe had committed againſt me. Being thus perplexed, and ſince ſhe could not avoid her Marriage with <hi>Theombres,</hi> ſhe reſolved to give her ſelfe ſo much ſatisfaction at the leaſt, as to let me know, that her minde was not changed, and that her affection ſhould for ever be the ſame as I had found it: Her Letter was thus written.</p>

               <p>When this Letter was brought unto me, I was ſorry at thoſe frequent reports of this Marriage; and though I was reſolved to be wholly <hi>Dorinde's,</hi> yet I could not chuſe but reſent the loſſe of <hi>Florice;</hi> for I eſteemed her loſt, in the alliance of <hi>Theombres.</hi> And ſee the ſubtlety of Love: He knew well enough, that to aſſault me openly was in vain, becauſe I was ſtill in mine anger, and therefore he would go another way with me. Firſt, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto me my hatred of <hi>Theombres,</hi> how undeſerving he was of this advantage,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:53526:134"/>
and how happy he would be in <hi>Florice.</hi> Then he repreſented unto me, the beauty and merits of <hi>Florice,</hi> what pitty it was that ſuch a man ſhould enjoy her; and brought into my memory all thoſe favours which I had received from her: To be briefe, he did ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print theſe conſiderations in my ſoul, that ere I was aware, I was more in love with her, then with <hi>Dorinde;</hi> ſo as when her Letter came unto my hands, and conſidering with a ſound judgment, the beauty, the quality, and the merits of the Writer, I did acknowledge that I had done her wrong, in quitting her for another much inferiour; and repenting of it, I intended to return to her again. Truth is, when I conſidered the remedy which ſhe propounded, to break off her Marriage with <hi>Theombres,</hi> I knew not what to reſolve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for I hated that fatall Tie of Marriage more then I can expreſſe; not with <hi>Florice</hi> in particular, but with any woman in generall; conceiving that there was no greater tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nor ſlavery amongſt the ſons of men, then that of Marriage.

               <p>Now, fair <hi>Phillis,</hi> I writ this Letter unto her, to the end ſhe ſhould think, I had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived hers; for otherwiſe, I had been obliged unto an anſwer, unleſſe I had utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined her, and rather conſented unto a death then to marry her; not, but that I did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely eſteem her, but theſe bonds of Marriage were moſt horrid unto me, and I had ſo good an opinion of my ſelfe, as I thought it certain ſhe would not be denyed me, if I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked her of her Parents: And leaſt ſhe ſhould be troubled about her Letter which ſhe had written unto me, I cauſed it to be carried back unto her by one of my ſervants, who was inſtructed to let her know, that I was gone out of the Town two or three daies before; and ſince he knew not whither I was gone, nor when I would return, he brought it back unto her, leſt it ſhould be loſt.

And, as fortune was, I being at the window, which I held halfe open, to ſee her paſſe by, ſhe eſpied me: But, Oh ye gods, how this viſion went to her heart? ſhe fell into a ſwoond, and lay in the armes of thoſe that went with her: And leſt I ſhould do the like, I was conſtrained to lie down upon my bed, and ſtirred not from it moſt part of that day At the laſt, ſhe was married with ſo many tears, as every one pittyed her. And becauſe I feared, leſt ſhe having ſeen me, ſhe ſhould think; I did but only give out that I was gone away, I procured an intimate friend that ſame night to let her underſtand, that I was departed, only becauſe I would not ſee this unhappy Marriage, and that my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was, never to return again; but, ſince my affection would not give me leave to be ſo far diſtant, I was conſtrained to return, but arrived in the moſt unfortunate minute that could be; and that it was abſolutely impoſſible I ſhould live, unleſſe ſhe gave me ſome aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that her affection was not changed. She, as if ſhe never heard him, took a Ring off from her finger, and put it into his hand: This Diamond, ſaid ſhe may aſſure him, that it hath leſſe conſtancy, then the affection which I promiſed unto him.</p>
               <p>Now hear, I beſeech you, what hapned: That very ſame night, and, I believe, about the very ſame houre, when <hi>Theombres</hi> had her in his armes, I was in my bed, and held my hand upon my breaſt, having the Ring upon my finger. I know not how, but it cut me, and made ſo deep a wound, that my ſhirt and ſheets were all bloody, and ever ſince, hath left a mark upon my ſide, neer my heart. Oh heavens! (cryed I out upon a ſuddain, thinking upon the wrong which I had done <hi>Florice,</hi> and <hi>Theombres</hi> had done me) how ſenſible am I of the offence and injury that is done unto my affection. Perhaps I have inſiſted too long upon theſe particulars; but I beſeech you excuſe <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſince he was never ſo touched to the heart by any other, except by you, my faireſt <hi>Phillis.</hi> Or except any in this Company, ſaid ſhe. But, pray tell us how you left <hi>Dorinde?</hi> Unto which <hi>Hylas</hi> replyed thus: When I was in the depth of my perplexities (for indeed I did love <hi>Florice,</hi> as well becauſe ſhe was fair, as becauſe I thought <hi>Dorinde</hi> loved another) the heavens helped me out with as good an occaſion as I could deſire. <hi>Periander,</hi> who, as I told you, was conſtrained to quit <hi>Dorinde</hi> unto me, and, not being able to ſee me enjoy her, was gone out of the Town,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:53526:135"/>
was at length forced to return, as not being able to endure ſo long out of her ſight; and though he did foreſee, his ſorrowes would be greater in ſeeing, then in hearing, of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; yet could he not chuſe but return, thinking it would be ſome conſolation unto his wound, to ſee the hand that gave it. And becauſe he came at the firſt to ſee me, aſſoon as he came, I reſolved to give, as they ſay, two blowes with one ſtone, to rid my ſelfe of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinde,</hi> and to oblige <hi>Periander.</hi> Two or three daies paſſed on, and he never talked one word unto me concerning <hi>Dorinde;</hi> and one time, being ſeparated from the Company, I ſaid thus unto him: <hi>Periander,</hi> it is impoſſible for my affection unto you, to ſuffer my ſelfe to be a cauſe of that melancholly which I have obſerved in your face, any longer; I love you too well, than to ſee you ſuffer for my ſake: You do not doubt of my affection unto <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinde,</hi> but you ſhall leſſe doubt of the affection I have unto you; And to give you evident teſtimony that it is not a little, I releaſe this <hi>Dorinde</hi> unto you, whom my good fortune took from you; and the affection I bear unto you, ſhall ſurmount the love I bear unto her: Receive her, therefore, <hi>Periander,</hi> from me, and be aſſured, that I ſhall leſſe grieve to part with her, then to ſee you thus ſad for my ſake, or be deprived of your preſence. If ever any condemned perſon was joyed when a Pardon came, <hi>Periander</hi> was as much, when he heard this; and yet his diſcretion and affection unto me, made him at the firſt refuſe it; but when he ſaw I perſiſted in this minde, he received it with ſo many thanks, as I was conſtrained to tell him, that ſhe was juſtly his due, knowing very well, that he did ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount me in love, as my good fortune and cunning ſurpaſſed his</p>
               <p>Then I retired by little and little from <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and <hi>Periander</hi> on the contrary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced. But, in the mean time, I attempted upon <hi>Florice,</hi> I found out the means to ſpeak unto her, and aſſured her of my affection. To be briefe, I contrived it ſo, as there was never better correſpondency betwixt us; and that which moſt helped me, was, the hollow-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted affection which ſhe bore unto <hi>Theombres:</hi> 'Tis true, ſhe had alwaies ſome ſuſpition of <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and therefore after ſhe thought that ſhe had made me hers, ſhe told me peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily, that ſhe would have me ſo clearly and openly break off with <hi>Dorinde,</hi> as ſhe ſhould never be in any doubt of it afterwards; otherwiſe, ſhe ſhould live in a continuall incertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my affection, and that ſhe had rather part fair with me, then live in ſuch continuall apprehenſions. I deſired, that my breach with <hi>Dorinde</hi> might be done by ſome civill way, and leaſt offenſive unto her. But ſhe would needs have it done by ſome rude and publick affront, and ſhe would not be perſwaded otherwiſe At the laſt, I reſolved upon it.</p>
               <p>Upon the ſixt of <hi>July,</hi> all the Gallantry of the Town went with the Druides to gather the ſacred <hi>Miſletoe,</hi> in the Forreſt of <hi>Mars,</hi> called <hi>Erieu;</hi> and then <hi>Florice</hi> charged me to ſatisfie her requeſt. All the Ladies were trimmed in their gayeſt dreſſes, and every one in the Athenian habit. The ſacrifice being ended, and publick rejoycings beginning, I took <hi>Periander</hi> apart, to the end he ſhould not be offended at what I did; I told him how I ſaw <hi>Dorinde</hi> had ſome hopes yet in me, and therefore ſhe did not receive his ſervice; ſo well as ſhe ought; but I would undeceive her, and daſh all her hopes. Then ſeeing her with <hi>Florice,</hi> and in the midſt of the beſt company, I went to her, and after ſome common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I ſaid unto her ſo loud, as all about her might hear Now I ſee <hi>Dorinde,</hi> that what is told me of you, is true. What's that, (ſaid ſhe, and ſmiled, little expecting ſuch an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer as I gave)? That you have (replyed I) the beſt opinion of your ſelfe, of any perſon in the world. Then ſhe bluſh'd, and asked me the reaſon of my judgment. Becauſe, ſaid I, you meaſuring others by your ſelfe; as you do love all you look upon, ſo you think every one is in love with you; and I know you are in that errour concerning me thinking that I am ready to die for the love of you: but, I would have you know, that your merits are too mean to make me ſuch a fool; if you think otherwiſe, undeceive your ſelfe, and be aſſured, that <hi>Hylas</hi> is aſhamed he ever loved you; or if he was ſuch a fool, that he is wiſer now. Imagine, noble <hi>Paris,</hi> how blank <hi>Dorinde</hi> was: For my part, I would not exchange a ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable more with her, but went away, and left her moſt pittifully out of countenance. Ever ſince, <hi>Florice</hi> was the moſt ſatisfied that is imaginable, and wholly devoted her ſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me And as <hi>Theombres</hi> ſtood for a Husband, ſo I enjoyed her as a Friend. But <hi>Dorinde,</hi> extreamly incenſed againſt me, reſolved to do me all the miſchiefe that poſſibly ſhe could, and diſcovering the intimate familiarity betwixt <hi>Florice</hi> and me, ſhe deſigned to thwart it: And becauſe I did not ſee her, though I was ſorry for it, for I did love her, though leſſethen I did <hi>Florice,</hi> ſhe thought <hi>Periander</hi> would be a fit inſtrument to work her ends by; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe began to ſhew him more countenance then accuſtomed, and, by degrees, ſeemed to love him better; at which <hi>Periander</hi> was ſo joyed, that he almoſt never ſtirred from her:
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:53526:136"/>
Having lived a while thus with him, ſhe acquainted him with the deceit I had uſed, in putting my Picture in the Mirror, and that he ſhould not doubt it, ſhe ſent for the woman who brought it to ſell. To be brief, ſhe told him ſo much in my diſadvantage, as ſhe cooled his affection unto me; and all this out of a deſigne, to get by his means, ſome of <hi>Florice's</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from me; &amp; therfore continuing her diſcourſe: He is (ſaid ſhe unto him) wholly devoted unto <hi>Florice,</hi> but it is only, untill ſome other paſſe before his eyes; for he is the veryeſt knave, and arranteſt weathercock that ever was. But (ſaid ſhe unto him, and held his hand in hers) will you do me one very great pleaſure? And he anſwering, that he would do any thing to ſerve her. She made him ſwear, he would be as good as his word. Then went ſhe on: You know, that <hi>Florice</hi> and I are friends and allies, I cannot believe that ſhe does love him: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you tel me all you know. Undeceive your ſelf in that, ſaid he unto her, aſſure your ſelf ſhe does love him, and there is hardly a day, but he hath a Letter from her. Oh my god, ſaid ſhe, can you not help me to the ſight of one of her Letters? Very eaſily, anſwered he, for he is very careleſſe of them. In this, <hi>Periander</hi> ſaid right; for the truth is, I know not what I did with all thoſe ſhe writ unto me, nor was I angry with my ſelfe for my careleſſneſſe. Well, ſaid <hi>Dorinde,</hi> now I ſhall ſee, whether or no you be a man of your word, and whether you love me; for if you do, and this be ſo, you will preſently bring me one of them. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riander,</hi> without any regard unto our friendſhip, whether it was by vertue of <hi>Dorinde's</hi> command or out of revenge upon me, for putting that trick upon him, but he came that very night to lie with me, as he often uſed, and ſtole away one which I received in his preſence, and the next morning, as ſoon as he could get into <hi>Dorinde's</hi> Chamber, he brought it unto her: It contained theſe words.</p>

               <p>You know, generous <hi>Paris,</hi> that upon ſuch Letters, they never any uſe to write Superſcriptions, leſt the Writer ſhould be diſcovered by the Direction; and therefore <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinde,</hi> after a thouſand thanks to <hi>Periander,</hi> went into her Cloſet, and ſuperſcribed it, <hi>Unto Theombres,</hi> afterwards ſealed it up very handſomely with a Seal, and giving it unto a creature of her own, inſtructed him what he ſhould do, and commanded him to carry it unto <hi>Theombres</hi> in all haſte, becauſe ſhe underſtood, that he was to go out of Town the ſame day: The fellow did as he was directed, and ſo nimbly, that whilſt <hi>Theombres</hi> was reading the Letter, he ſlipt away, and came to <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and told her what he had done. I refer it unto your imagination, faireſt Miſtreſſe, whether the Husband was not amazed, when he ſaw his Wife's Letter, and much more, when he read it: It wrought this influence upon him, that whereas before he ſhould have gone out of the Town ſingle, now he muſt go double, and carry his wife with him; but not before he had ſhewed the Letter unto her, and had ſhreudly reprehended her for it. She excuſed her ſelfe as well as ſhe could, telling him, it was long ſince this Letter was writ, and that it was <hi>Dorinde</hi> who had now written the ſuperſcription of it. To which <hi>Theombres</hi> anſwered, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhe writ it ſhe was to blame, and could not be excuſed. She replyed, that <hi>Dorinde</hi> and ſhe being intimate friends, did often uſe to write ſuch unto each other, and invite themſelves thereby to come and viſit one another; and that <hi>Dorinde</hi> being angry with her, and knowing that he was to go out of Town, had, in revenge upon her, ſent him this Letter, which truly, ſaid ſhe, you may well believe to be ſo, ſince the ſuperſcription is written with <hi>Dorinde's</hi> own hand; and that if ſhe would, ſhe could ſhew ſeverall others of the like nature, as I might of hers had I been as carefull in keeping them as ſhe is. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ombres</hi> was ſomething ſatisfied with this excuſe, yet not ſo, but he conſtrained her to go with him out of Town, and would not let her have more leaſure, then to write one word unto <hi>Hylas,</hi> and left it in the hands of her Maid, in whom ſhe had good aſſurance of her fidelity. For my part, I thought ſhe had ſtayed at home, and that <hi>Theombres</hi> had gone by himſelfe therefore I went at night to the uſuall place of meeting. But this Maid opening the dore, ſhe gave me <hi>Florice's</hi> Letter, and ſhut the dore again immediately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. and would not ſpeak one ſyllable unto me: This made me fear ſome dyſaſterous accident had hapned, and therefore returned to my lodging, where as ſoon as ever I got a

               <p>Oh heavens! how this Letter went to my heart, I was in ſuch a ſtrange confuſion of thoughts that I could not imagine why <hi>Florice</hi> ſhould write thus, I ſpent all that night in walking up and down my Chamber, and as ſoon as it was day, I ſent a ſervant to finde out a way, how I might ſpeak with her who gave me the Letter; but it could not be, all that day: When night came, I underſtood all from her, how <hi>Florice</hi> had an opinion, that I had given this Letter unto <hi>Dorinde,</hi> which made her believe, that I did only diſſemble, when I ſeemed to caſt off <hi>Dorinde,</hi> and did it only to delude her. I put my hand preſently into my pocket, and not finding my Letter, I did ſuppoſe, that <hi>Periander</hi> had ſtollen it from me: After a thouſand proteſtations of my innocency unto this Maid, I went away with reſolutions of revenge: But when I met my friend, and with a frowning brow taxed him with his theft, he anſwered me, with a ſmile; If I have diſpleaſed you, ſaid he, I am ſorry; but you may well forget it, if you do but conſider, that now we are upon eeven termes, for your ſtealing of <hi>Dorinde</hi> from me by your artifice of the Mirror. But friend, ſaid I unto him, I have reſtored your Miſtreſſe unto you, and you have cauſed me to loſe mine. I know not anſwered he, how to give you ſatisfaction in that, unleſſe by reſtoring her unto you, in acquainting her with my theft. Truth is, I did love <hi>Periander,</hi> and perhaps as much as I did any of theſe Ladies; therefore I received his excuſe, conceiving it to be the only means to reingratiate my ſelfe into <hi>Florice's</hi> favour: And therefore turning all into rallarie, we waited for <hi>Florice's</hi> return. But, <hi>Theombres</hi> being but halfe ſatisfied with his Wife's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, he reſolved to ſtay a while in the Country, the better to diſcover who made any addreſſes unto her, and to finde out her humour; and he ſtayed ſo long, that I was in the interim paſt my patience; therefore I went to ſee <hi>Criſide,</hi> and ſeeing her, loved her; and the truth is, ſhe did deſerve it, for I never in all my life, ſaw a more lovely and attractive ſtranger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſtrea</hi> had taken much delight in the diſcourſe of <hi>Hylas,</hi> had it been at any other ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but being extreamly deſirous to be at the place where <hi>Silvande:</hi> found <hi>Celadon's</hi> Letter, ſhe was impatient at any thing which gave a ſtop unto it: And this was the reaſon, why upon the firſt occaſion which preſented it ſelfe, ſhe made a ſigne unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> that it was time to be gone, and that ſhe was weary of ſo long a ſtay. When ſhe ſaw that <hi>Phillis</hi> did not underſtand her meaning, and likewiſe ſaw <hi>Hylas</hi> offering to continue his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>Criſide,</hi> ſhe prevented him with theſe words: I did not think, that the beauty of <hi>Phillis</hi> could have had ſo much power over ſo free a ſpirit, as to hold him in one diſcourſe above an houre; but, ſince her rigour does not conſider his conſtraint, let us ſhew our ſelves more kinde and diſcreet, in interrupting him; for, the heat of the day being over, walking will be more delightfull then talking. Upon this, ſhe roſe up, and the reſt of the Company followed her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hylas</hi> taking <hi>Phillis</hi> under the arme: I am very glad, faireſt Miſtreſſe (ſaid he) that ſhe, who is the moſt inſenſible, does reſent ſome of that pain which you put upon me, and does ſee the love I have unto you. He meant this by <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> whom he thought to be a perſon that never had loved any: And ſee how commonly our judgments are deceived by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances and ſhewes; for, <hi>Phillis</hi> deſiring to leave him in that opinion. Thoſe, ſaid ſhe, who do love well, do never uſe to give teſtimony of their affection by the report of perſons, who do not know how to love, but by their own obſequious ſervices. And as for that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience which you have been put to, in ſpeaking ſo long, I believe you are as ſufficiently payed for it, by my hearing you ſo long. This, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> is the intolerable arrogance and ingratitude of all the Shepheardeſſes in this Country. And becauſe <hi>Phillis</hi> would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the reſt of her Companions, he lead her by the arme, and continued thus: Becauſe you will not be obliged unto me, you will not only deny me the merit of my patience but you think I am beholding unto you for hearing me: By what Law, I beſeech you, is this? The ſame, ſaid ſhe, that a Lord doth impoſe upon his Slave. Nay, rather, ſaid he, a Tyrant
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:53526:137"/>
upon his People. Why, replyed <hi>Phillis,</hi> do you take me for a Tyrant? Surely there is this difference betwixt us that I do not uſe any force or violence againſt you. Can you ſay ſo, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> and not bluſh? Do you think it is not by force, that <hi>Hylas</hi> hath continued ſo long under your power? I pray, ſaid ſhe, where are my Fetters, my Manacles, my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſions, and my Priſons? Ah! moſt ignorant, and too much diſſembling ſhepheardeſſe, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> your Chains are ſo ſtrangely indiſſolvable, that I would not be delivered from them, for all the freedome and liberty in the world. Judge, if your Manacles be not very ſtrong, ſince <hi>Hylas</hi> cannot break them; <hi>Hylas,</hi> I ſay, whom a thouſand Beauties could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hold, nor keep him from breaking looſe from them all. In the mean time, <hi>Paris</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken <hi>Diana</hi> by her hand, <hi>Silvander,</hi> out of his diſcretion kept a diſtance; for he would force his affection, and in his reſpect unto his Shepheardeſſe, give place unto <hi>Paris,</hi> as all the ſhepheardeſſes were very ready to pay all due reſpects unto him, who for their ſakes; had quitted the grandure and eminency of his quality. As fortune was <hi>Mandonte</hi> was alone, and becauſe <hi>I herſander</hi> was taken up with <hi>Laonice, Silvander</hi> took her hand, and reſolved to wait upon her during all the voyage; and though he made this addreſſe unto her at the firſt, becauſe he knew not where to finde a better; yet afterwards, he was well pleaſed with his choice, for this ſhepheardeſſe was both fair and diſcreet, and had ſome features in her face and actions, which did much reſemble <hi>Diana;</hi> not that ſhe was ſo fair as ſhe, nor ſo like being together; but if aſſunder, they had much one of the other, in their reſemblance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Silvander,</hi> ſince he could not be with <hi>Diana,</hi> was very glad his lot fell upon one that had any thing like her; but much more, when by diſcourſe with her, he found a neerer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance in her Tone; and therefore, ever ſince this day, he was much pleaſed with her company; yet a little after, he payed very dear for his delight. <hi>Tireis</hi> waited upon <hi>Aſtrea, Paris</hi> upon <hi>Diana,</hi> and <hi>Hylas</hi> upon <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſo as <hi>Therſander</hi> ſeeing his place was taken up by <hi>Silvander,</hi> he was forced to fall upon <hi>Laonice.</hi> She, who kept her eyes continually upon <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Silvander,</hi> did obſerve how that ſhepheard was much pleaſed with <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donte,</hi> and that ſhe might know more, ſhe deſired <hi>Therſander</hi> to go neerer them, which his jealous apprehenſions prompted him very eaſily to do; yet, they could not hear any thing, but common diſcourſe. They had not walked above a quarter of an houre in a long Meadow, but <hi>Silvander</hi> ſhewed them the Wood, unto which he would conduct them. Preſently after, they entred into a thick Cops; and becauſe the Path was very narrow they were conſtrained to go in file. At laſt, <hi>Silvander,</hi> who, as their conductor, walked firſt, he much wondred, to ſee ſome boughes of trees heaped one upon another, in the faſhion of an Arbour, which obſtructed his paſſe. All the Company going through this Arbour, came up to him, to know why he ſtayed, and ſeeing no path: How now <hi>Silvander,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Phillis)</hi> do you that undertook to be our Guide, conduct us thus? I muſt confeſſe, ſaid he, that I have loſt the way which I went the laſt morning; but, I believe this to be a nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and better. The way, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> is very good, if you had conducted us to Hunt, for I ſee nothing but Wood. <hi>Silvander</hi> was vexed that he loſt his way, but he was more amazed then before, when heſaw another more ſpacious Arbour in the form of a Temple: at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, there was ſome Verſes written, which <hi>Silvander</hi> ſtayed to read. All the Company being weary they called upon him ſeverall times. He, in a great amazement, turned towards <hi>Diana:</hi> Miſtreſſe, ſaid he, do not repent your ſelfe of the pains you have taken, in comming hither; for, though you are a little digreſſed of the way, yet, you ſhal ſee here a wonder of the Wood: Then taking her hand, he conducted her to the entry: the reſt of the Shepheards and Shepheardeſſes followed in ſile, and longed to ſee this rarity of which <hi>Silvander</hi> ſpoke. Before the entrance was a Court of green graſſe, about thirty paces ſquare, environed with thick wood on three ſides, ſo as none could ſee them. A chryſtall Fountain, which took its originall oppoſite to the Porch, or rather, Arbour, of this Temple, did, Meander like, run by the one ſide, which rendred the place moſt delectable. This Grove was ever a place, that had been dedicated as ſacred unto the great <hi>Heſeus, Tentates,</hi> and <hi>Taramis:</hi> And there was no ſhepheard that ever durſt preſume to drive his Flock neer this Thicket; and the reaſon why it was never frequented, was, leſt they ſhould diſturb the ſolitude and ſacred ſilence of the <hi>Nymphs, Pans,</hi> and <hi>Egipans.</hi> The graſſe was never ſullied, the wood never felt the axe, nor was brouſed by any cattle, and the Fountain was never defiled by any foot: ſo as this little Grove, dreſſed into the faſhion of an Arbour, or rather a Temple, did plainly demonſtrate, that it was dedicated unto ſome deitie: And therefore all theſe Shepheards approaching the entrance with reverence, before they paſſed any further, they
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:53526:137"/>
did read the Verſes which were written upon a Table of wood over the Porch: They were theſe.</p>

               <p>The Shepheards and Shepheardeſſes ſtood amazed at this Inſcription, and looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another, as if they were deſirous to know, whether any of the Company did either know, or had ſeen this before. <hi>Diana</hi> addreſsed her ſelfe unto <hi>Silvander;</hi> Is this the place, Shepheard, (ſaid ſhe) unto which you did intend to bring us? No, anſwered he, I never ſaw this place in my life before.</p>
               <p>It is evident, ſaid <hi>Paris,</hi> that theſe boughes have been lately lopped and put into this order, for the leaves of them are yet green. However, ſaid he, we muſt go in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But, leſt we ſhould offend the deitie, unto whom the place is conſecrated let us enter in with all poſſible reverence; and firſt, let us make our ſelves as clean as we can.</p>
               <p>Every one conſented, except <hi>Hylas,</hi> who anſwered, That for his part, he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do there: For ſaid he, ſince all thoſe are forbidden to enter, that are not enflamed with an holy Love, I know not whether or no I ought to enter: I know that I am enflamed with Love, but, whether it be holy or no, faith I am not ſure. How, Servant, (ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> and ſmiled) a defect in your Love! What do you in our company? For my part, anſwered he, I have abundance of affection after my own faſhion; but, what know I, whether it be ſuch affection as theſe Verſes means? And I have heard ſay, that it is not good jeaſting with the gods. See, <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> what a ſhame your impure affection doth bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you in this good Company. You ſay very true indeed, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> but did you take this act as you ought to do, you would rather commend me for it for, in being obedient unto the commands of the divinities which are adored in this place, I do make it appear, by my great reverence of them, that I do reverence them as I ought to do; whereas you, who deſpiſe their commands, do prophane the ſacred place by your preſumptuous bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: for, your own ſoul, if it would not diſſemble, can tell you, that your affections are not ſo ſacred as is required. I ſhall anſwer you preſently, ſaid <hi>Silvander.</hi> Then he and all the company waſhed their hands, put off their ſhoes, and with bare feet entred into the Arbour. Then <hi>Silvander</hi> turning towards <hi>Hylas:</hi> Hearken, <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid he, and be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of my words. Afterwards reading the Verſes again, and lifting his eyes up to heaven, and kneeling: Oh great deity (ſaid he) who is adored in this place, I here enter into the ſacred Grove, being moſt aſſured, that I do not contradict thy will, knowing my love to be ſo holy, and ſo pure, that thou wilt be pleaſed to accept the vowes and ſupplications of a ſoul ſo amorouſly ſanctified as mine; and it this profeſſion which I here make, be not true, puniſh, O great deitie, this my perjury and preſumption.</p>
               <p>After this, with hands lifted up, and head bare, he entred into the Arbour, and all the reſt after him, except <hi>Hylas.</hi> The place was ſpacious, ſome ſixteen or ſeventeen paces round, and in the midſt, a great branch-ſoreading Oake; at the root of this Tree was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected a graſſy Table, in the form of an Altar upon which ſtood a Picture, &amp; in it two <hi>Cupids</hi> drawn, who did ſtrive with one another for a branch of Mirtle and Palm wreathed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As ſoon as this devout company was entred, every one fell upon their knees and after they had in private adored the deity of the place <hi>Paris</hi> approaching the Altar, and taking upon him the office of a Druide, having gathered ſome Oake leaves: Accept (ſaid he) O great deitie, that is adored in this place, the humble devotion of all this zealous Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. I do with all humility and devotion, offer unto thee in their names, a few leaves of this bleſſed Tree, under whoſe ſhade it pleaſeth thee to be ador'd. Then every one aroſe, and went unto the Altar, to look upon the Picture which was upon it; in which they ſaw two <hi>Cupids,</hi> as I told you, who holding in both their hands a branch of Mirtle and Palm wreathed together, the one did ſtrive to take it from the other. The Limner was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in his Art; for theſe little lovely Boyes were plump and fat, yet, their Muſcles and Nerves might be ſeen which by reaſon of their ſtriving ſeemed to be raiſed up; both their right thighes were advanced, and their feet almoſt touched each other; both their armes
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:53526:138"/>
were ſtretched out, and their bodies leaned backwar I, as if they knew, that the further off a weight is, the heavier it is; and the weight of their little bodies, lent more ſtrength unto their ſtriving armes. Their faces were both fair, but bluſhing, by reaſon of the blood which came into them by ſtriving, which the great veins upon their temples and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads did ſufficiently teſtifie. And the Artiſt had been ſo carefull, and wrought it with ſuch induſtry, that though he did repreſent an action, which made it appear, that both of them would vanquiſh; yet, one might perceive by their countenances, that there was no enmity betwixt them, having, for all their Combat, mixed a kinde of ſweetneſſe and ſmiling in their eyes, and about both their mouths. Their Torches which were on each ſide of them, which they had let fall, by chance, fell one againſt another, ſo as they united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and made but one, by this means added luſtre to each other, and gave the greater light with this Motto, <hi>Our Wills are but one.</hi> Their Bowes were ſo linked and twiſted one with the other, that they could not draw them but both together; their Quivers, which were hung upon their ſhoulders, were full of Arrowes; but by the colour of their feathers one might know, that thoſe which the one had, belonged unto the other, becauſe in the gilded Quiver, were ſilver feathered Arrowes, and in the ſilvered Quiver, gilded Arrowes. The Company had looked long, and not underſtood this piece, i the ſhepheard <hi>Silvande,</hi> at the requeſt of <hi>Paris,</hi> had not interpreted the ſignification Theſe two <hi>Cupids</hi> (ſaid he) do ſignifie the Lover and the Loved; this Palm and Mirtle-wreath doth expreſſe the victory of Love, for the Palme is an emblem of Victory, and the Mir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e of Love. The Lover and the Loved do ſtrive, which ſhall be victorious; that is, which ſhall be moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. Thoſe Torches, whoſe flames are joyned together, and by this union, more ſplendent, doth ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w, that reciprocall Love doth augment affection. The Bowes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twiſted and linked ſo together, that one cannot draw them without the other, do teach us, that all things are ſo in commun betwixt friends, as the puiſſance of the one is that of the other, ſo as neither can do any thing, unleſſe his Companion contribute his, which the changing of the Arrowes doth more illuſtrate. One may alſo ſee by this conjunction of Bowes, and Flames, and change of Arrowes, and union of two Wills into one, that the Lover and the Loved are but one: So as I perceive, this Picture repreſents unto us that the endeavours of two Loves to get the victory one over the other, their conteſt is not, who ſhould be beſt Loved, but who ſhould beſt Love, giving us to underſtand, that the perfection of Love conſiſts, in ſtriving how to Love, and not how to be Loved. Now if this be ſo, faireſt Miſtreſſe, ſaid he and turned towards <hi>Diana,</hi> you may ſee, how much you are in my debt. I muſt ingenuouſly confeſs, (ſaid ſhe) that after this rate I had rather be in your debt, than have you in mine. <hi>Hylas,</hi> who ſtood at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and durſt go no further, though he had a great deſire unto it, and the more, when peeping in, he ſaw the graſſy Altar, and Picture upon it: And becauſe he could not well ſee, he employed his ear with all attention, to hearken unto <hi>Silvander's</hi> diſcourſe, and heard what he ſaid unto <hi>Diana.</hi> I perceive, faireſt Miſtreſs, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> that neither you nor I are repreſented in this piece, ſince they in it are both Lovers and Loved; you are loved, but do not love; and I do love but am not loved, and all this more by ill fortune, then by reaſon.</p>
               <p>There is no difference betwixt us, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> but in words; for I call that reaſon, which you do call ill fortune, and yet it is the ſame thing. If all the difference (ſaid he) were only in words I would not care; but the worſt is, that which you call reaſon and I ill fortune, fills me full of all miſeries, and its contrary would make me the moſt happy ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard in the whole Univerſe Afterwards he turned towards the Picture and as <hi>Diana</hi> would have anſwered: I beſeech you, my Faireſt (ſaid he) do not talk any more of your ſmall affection to me, but let me ſee what is yet more rare in this Picture. Then taking her by the hand, he read theſe words, thus written in the bottom.</p>

That might have been, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> if there was none here but my ſelfe that could read; or if theſe Lawes were contrary unto Reaſon, or the antient Statutes of Love.

                  <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was ſhe, who was moſt concerned at this; whether it was, becauſe of the name, in which ſhe thought her ſelfe moſt intereſſed; or whether becauſe ſhe heard ſpeak of the dedication of <hi>dayes</hi> and <hi>ſorrowes;</hi> ſo it was, ſhe did apprehend, that by it was meant the fortune of the poor and unfortunate <hi>Celadon.</hi> She looked, and long pondered upon this inſcription, and in the mean time, the reſt of the company going a little farther, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Vault like to the firſt, but much bigger, they all fel down upon their knees, and having paid their particular devotions in ſilence unto the deity, to whom that place was conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Paris,</hi> as he did before, ſo now, offered for all the Company, an Oaken bough upon the Altar. It was of graſſe, like unto the other, but made triangular; and in the midſt ſtood a goodly Oake, whoſe top ſurveyed all the Trees of this ſacred Grove. It ſeemed by this Tree, that Nature was wanton in her production of it, having from one ſtock ſent forth three ſeverall branches, three ſeverall wayes, yet moſt admirably united at the top, without the help of any Artifice; on one branch was written upon the bark <hi>Heſius,</hi> upon another, <hi>Belinus,</hi> and on the other <hi>Tharamis;</hi> upon the ſtock which ſent forth theſe three branches, <hi>Tautates,</hi> and at the top where they reunited, <hi>Tautates</hi> again.</p>
               <p>Theſe things, which were according to the cuſtomes of their Religion, did not much aſtoniſh them, for they did uſe to worſhip god under Oakes; but that which they ſaw on the left hand, amazed them very much; it was another Altar, of graſſe alſo, with two great Pots of earth out of which did grow two ſtocks of Mirtle, betwixt which was a Picture, over which the two Mirtles twiſted their branches, into a reſemblance of a Crown. This was apparently viſible not to be Naturall, but wreathed in that manner by Art. The Picture repreſented a Shepheardeſſe; at the top of it was written, <hi>This is the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe</hi> ASTREA; and at the bottome, this:</p>
               <q>More worthy of our Adoration, than we of her.</q>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Diana</hi> looked upon it, ſhe turned towards <hi>Phillis:</hi> Did you never ſee any (ſaid ſhe) whom this Piece reſembles? Reſembles, ſaid ſhe? it is the very ſubſtance of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrea:</hi> I never ſaw Picture ſo exquiſitely done, nor more like, in all my life: Is not that the very ſame ſheephook, which <hi>Aſtrea</hi> hath in her hand? Obſerve the Letters <hi>C</hi> and <hi>A</hi> which are upon it, and intertwiſted together with knots. You are in the right, ſaid <hi>Diana;</hi> and ſee, there is <hi>Melampus</hi> lying at her feet: that Dog is very knowable by his Marks, halfe his head white, the other black; and upon the black ear, a white ſpot: Obſerve alſo the white liſt about his neck in faſhion of a coller, and the ſilver halfe Moon upon his ſable coat; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the black and white liſt along his legs. <hi>Silvander</hi> came to her, and <hi>Phillis,</hi> and ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: Amongſt all the Flock there, I have found which is that that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> loved beſt; There it is, all white, except the ears, which are black. <hi>Aſtrea</hi> hearing all this diſcourſe, ſtood aſtoniſhed and mute, and, with admiration, beheld all ſhe ſaw; yet going neerer the Altar, and finding ſeverall pieces of paper lapped up upon it, ſhe took one of them and opening it with a trembling hand, ſhe found theſe Verſes.</p>

Whilſt <hi>Diana,</hi> to amuſe the company, did read theſe Lines aloud, and theſe being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, took others, of which the Altar was full, <hi>Phillis</hi> addreſſed her ſelfe unto <hi>Aſtrea:</hi> Oh heavens! dear Siſter, (ſaid ſhe unto her) how I am amazed at all I finde in this place?

               <p>Oh Siſter, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> it is moſt certainly <hi>Celadon</hi> that writ theſe Verſes, it is without any manner of doubt: for, about three years ſince, he did write them upon my Picture, which my Father had of me to give unto my Uncle <hi>Focion.</hi> Upon this, tears flowed from her eyes. But <hi>Phillis,</hi> fearing the reſt of the Company would ſee her: Siſter, ſaid ſhe, this is rather a cauſe of rejoycing then ſorrow; for, if <hi>Celadon</hi> did write it as I do believe he did, certainly he is not dead, although you think he was drowned; and if it be ſo, what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cauſe of joy could you have. Ah Siſter (ſaid ſhe, turning the other way, and puſhing her from her) for gods ſake do not torment me with any ſuch language, <hi>Celadon</hi> is too certainly dead, by my folly; and I am moſt miſerable in the loſſe. I ſee the gods are not yet contented with thoſe tears, that I have already ſhed for him, ſince they have brought me hither, to give me a freſh ſubject for more: But, ſince they will have it ſo, I will turn my ſelfe wholly into tears; and though I cannot wholly waſh away my offence by them, yet, I will never ceaſe, untill I have loſt either my eyes, or my life, or both. I do not tell you, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> that <hi>Celadon</hi> is alive; but I muſt tell you, that if he did write theſe Verſes, I muſt of neceſſity conclude, that he is not dead. Siſter, ſaid ſhe, our Druides tell us, that we have ſoules which never die, although our bodies do; and ſo in that ſence he may live. I have heard ſay, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> that it is our duty to give a buriall unto the dead, and to put a piece of mony in their mouths, to pay the Ferry-man, for wafting them over the Stygian Lake; and that ſuch as are deprived of buriall, are a hundred years wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring about the places where they loſt their bodies; and how can you tell, but that the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:53526:141"/>
ſoul of <hi>Celadon</hi> having loſt his body, and being denyed that charitable office, may be wandring about the fatall River of <hi>Lignon,</hi> and ſtill retain the ſame affection and thoughts which he had before? Ah Siſter, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> theſe are but meer phantaſms; <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon</hi> is certainly dead, and theſe are the teſtimonies of his affection, and my folly. What I do ſay, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> is grounded upon more then phantaims and Chimeraes, and I hint then upto you, out of my deſire to contribute unto your tranquillity. I do know it, Siſter replyed <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> but conſider, that if I ſhould think <hi>Celadon</hi> alive, and afterwards finde him to be dead, nothing could preſerve my life; this would be, to ſee him die twice: and the gods, and my own heart do know, how near his firſt death did bring me to my grave. Yet, you may receive this ſatisfaction by it, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> as to know, that death could not extinguiſh the affection which he bore unto you. That, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> conduceth unto his glory and my puniſhment. Nay rather, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> this conſtruction may be made of it, that he being dead, does cleerly and without a cloud ſee, the pure and entire affection which you bear unto him, and that the jealouſie, which cauſed your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger againſt him, did proceed only from the ſuperabundance of your love; for I have heard ſay that our ſoules ſeparated from the bodies, do ſtill ſee and behold them. This, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> would be the greateſt ſatisfaction that I can receive; for I do not doubt, but as my imprudence did give him great cauſe of griefe, ſo this ſight of my affection would give him contentment: For, if I did not love him above all the world, and if I do not continue ſtil in the ſame affection may the gods never love me. Theſe two Shepheardeſſes were talking thus, whilſt <hi>Diana</hi> entertained the reſt of the Company, ſometimes in reading the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers which ſhe found upon the Altar and ſometimes a king <hi>Paris, Tircis,</hi> and <hi>Silvander,</hi> what was their thoughts of theſe things. There is not any here but knowes, ſaid <hi>Paris,</hi> but this Picture was made for <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and conceives, that he who put it in this place, does not only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ove, but adore her. For my part, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> if <hi>Celadon</hi> were not dead, I ſhould believe theſe Characters to be his. How ſaid <hi>Tircis, Celadon</hi> who was drowned ſome three or four months ſince in the River <hi>Lignon?</hi> The ſame, anſwered <hi>Silvander.</hi> Did he, ſaid <hi>Tircis,</hi> love <hi>Aſtrea?</hi> I have heard ſay, that there was a moſt inveterate enmity betwixt their Families.</p>
               <p>The beauty of this ſhepheardeſſe, anſwered <hi>Silvander,</hi> was greater then their hatred; and ſince he is dead, I hope there is no danger in ſaying ſo. Nor do I believe there would, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> if he were alive; for, he being ſo diſcreet and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſo wiſe, their affection could not offend any. <hi>Aſtrea</hi> hearing what they ſaid of her, though her eyes were not yet dry, ſhe could not chuſe but anſwer them: Theſe tears, ſaid ſhe, which I cannot hide, do teſtifie, that <hi>Celadon</hi> did love me; but theſe Manuſcripts do teſtifie, that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> hath rather offended againſt Love then Duty: But, to give him ſatisfaction after his death, I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly confeſſe, more then decency would permit me when he was alive, and ſay, <hi>I did love him.</hi> Upon theſe words, all the company came to her, and <hi>Diana</hi> ſhewing her the papers which ſhe had in her hand: Is this ſaid ſhe, <hi>Celadon's</hi> writing? Doubtleſſe it is, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> Then, ſaid <hi>Diana</hi> it is a ſigne he is not dead. Unto which <hi>Phillis</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That is it of which we have been ſpeaking; but ſhe tells me, that <hi>Celadon's</hi> ſoul, which wonders about the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> did write them. Why, ſaid <hi>Tircis,</hi> was he not buried? That's the reaſon, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> why he wanders thus; for they never made him a Tombe. This, ſaid <hi>Paris,</hi> was moſt careleſly done, to let ſo brave a ſoul as <hi>Celadon's</hi> ſuffer ſo long pain for want of a little care. You may ſee, ſaid <hi>Tircis,</hi> how little thoſe that are alive do care for the dead; ſo as I eſteem them to be wiſe, who bury themſelves alive. Indeed, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> it is very ſtrange, that this ſhepheard; ſo much loved and lamented, not only by all his Kindred, but by all the Neighbourhood, ſhould not have that chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table office done him, which many have, who are leſſe loved. Perhaps ſaid <hi>Thorſander,</hi> the gods did ſo ordain it, to the end, he ſhould not ſo ſoon have that place he had ſo much loved, and being recompenſed with his love, he had rather ſtay ſome while neer her he had adored. However, I conceive, ſaid <hi>Tircis,</hi> that even as our bodies cannot be in the Aire, Water, or Fire, without much pain, becauſe being ponderous and heavy, they muſt perpetually be unquiet, as long as they are in ſuch pure Elements, as have no ſolidity in them to reſt upon; ſo the ſoul, ſeperated from the body, not being in its proper Element, as long as it is amongſt us, is in continuall pain, untill it enter into the <hi>Elizian</hi> fields, where it will finde another Earth, another Aire, another Water, and another Fire, more perfect, proper, and ſuitable unto its nature, then unto our dull, and groſſe bodies. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when my deareſt, and ſo much loved <hi>Cleon,</hi> dyed, I was in a reſolution not to bury
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:53526:141"/>
her, that I might have retained her deareſt ſoul the longer about me; but, our Druides con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me of that error, and told me, as I have told you. For my part, ſaid <hi>Sivander,</hi> ſince for went of buriall, men ſhall ſtay ſome time longer in the place where they dyed, I heartily deſire all my friends, that if I do die in this Country not to bury me, that I may the longer look upon my faireſt Miſtreſſe; for, there are no joyes in the <hi>Elizian</hi> fields com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable unto that bleſſed viſion, nor any pains that a ſoul can ſuffer, by being out of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Element, but are recompenſed by it.</p>
               <p>That would do very well, ſaid <hi>Tircis,</hi> if after we be ſeparated from our bodies, we did retain our affections: but, our Sages tell us, that our paſſions are only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ibutes of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the gods did beſtow them upon us, to the end, the race of men ſhould not fail; but after death, ſoules being immortall, and not in a capacity of engendring, our Paſſions and our Loves are loſt in it, even as our deſires of eating, or drinking, or ſleeping. But, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> if <hi>Celadon</hi> did write theſe Papers, it is not likely he hath loſt his affection &amp; love unto this Shepheardeſſe. Who knowes, ſaid <hi>Tircis,</hi> but that the gods, who are infinitely juſt, were pleaſed to give him that particular ſatisfaction, in recompence of that pure and ſacred affection which he had unto that ſhepheardeſſe? If ſo, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> why ſhould not I hope to finde the gods as juſt and favourable unto me, as him, ſince my affection ſhall not yield unto him or any other, either in purity or zeal? But, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi> if the gods do ſhew him this as a favour, would it not be impiety, to deprive him of that contentment, by endeavouring to give him a buriall, and ſo ſet him out of this world? No, ſaid <hi>Tircis,</hi> for the gods do favour him in it, only as a comfort in the pains which he is continually in, being conſtrained to be abſent from heaven, ſo contrary to its nature.</p>
               <p>The Shepheards were thus diſcourſing, when <hi>Phillis,</hi> eſpied a place, which ſeemed, as if ſome had been upon their knees, for ſuch marks were imprinted upon the earth; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was juſt oppoſite to the Altar, and ſhe alſo ſpying a piece of Parchment cloſe by it, ſhe went to ſee what it was, and opening it, ſhe found theſe words.</p>

                           <p>OH great and puiſſant goddeſſe, although your perfections cannot be equal'd, and though all our ſacrifices come infinitely ſhort of your merits; yet, I beſeech thee, let them be acceptable in thy ſight, ſince if you ſhould receive none, but ſuch as are worthy of you, the gods themſelves muſt be the Victim. This which I here moſt humbly offer unto your divinity, is a Heart, and a Will, which were never dedicated unto any, but only your ſelfe. If this offering be acceptable, look with the eyes of pitty upon that ſoul, who ever found them full of love, and by an act worthy of your ſelfe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then, all comming neer, ſhe read aloud this prayer, whilſt <hi>Aſtrea</hi> did accompany every word with a tear, though ſhe did ſtrive all that poſſibly ſhe could to reſtrain them. When <hi>Phillis</hi> had ended: Truly, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I ſhall ſatisfie his moſt juſt demand; and if his Parents will not build him a Sepulcher, which they are obliged unto by Conſanguinity, he ſhall receive one from me as his friend. Upon this word, going from that place, all the Company went back to <hi>Hylas,</hi> who was not idle all the while; for, ſeeing them all very ſerious and intentive in the other Arbour, he came into that where was the twelve Statutes of the Lawes of Love; and taking the Picture in his hand, he read them, then altered them according to his own humour; and having a quick and ready Wit, he changed them thus.</p>

                  <hi>Hylas</hi> made all the haſte that poſſibly he could, in altering theſe twelve Statutes, and that the alteration might be leſſe diſcemed, he firſt eraſed out what he thought fit with the point of his knife, then did poliſh it with the haft of his knife, then did write upon it what he had changed; and when all was done, he ſet it in its place again, and went out, unperceived by any; ſo as when they came out, he was found ſitting at the entry, as if he were faſt aſleep: and becauſe ſad <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> going out the firſt, did take no notice of him, he lay ſtill, and would not ſtir; but when <hi>Phillis,</hi> who came after, ſpied him in this lazy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture: How now, <hi>Hylas,</hi> (ſaid ſhe unto him) how have you ſpent your time, whilſt we have been viewing the greateſt rarities, that are in all the Country? Faith, I have ſome
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:53526:143"/>
thoughts (anſwered <hi>Hylas,</hi> riſing up lazily, and rubbing his eyes) which trouble me, more then ever I did imagine they could. What are they, ſaid <hi>Phillis?</hi> I will tell you, ſaid he, if you will promiſe to do one thing forme, which I ſhall ask. I will not engage my word, ſaid ſhe, before I know what it is. You may do it, ſaid <hi>Silvander</hi> by adding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, that he ſhall ask nothing which is unfitting for a wife and vertuous ſhepheardeſſe to grant. Upon that condition, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> I will. Know then, faireſt Miſtreſſe, (ſaid <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las)</hi> that I do believe, this place to be really a ſacred Grove, which is dedicated unto ſome great divinity; for, ever ſince I heard <hi>Silvander</hi> read the Lawes of Love, I have had ſuch inward remorſe, as I cannot be at quiet within my ſelfe; conceiving, that I have hitherto lived in a moſt groſſe errour, and contrary unto thoſe Statutes, which the god, who is adored in this place, hath commanded unto all thoſe who will love; inſomuch as I am ready to abjure my errour, and ſubmit my ſelfe unto the Lawes which he hath ordained: There was only one thing which hindred nie from doing it, whilſt you were within the ſacred Grove, and I will declare it unto you: You know, faireſt Miſtreſſe, that ever ſince there was any ſympathy betwixt my heart and you, and ſince <hi>Hylas</hi> firſt called himſelfe your ſervant, I never found in all this Country a more contradicting ſpirit, nor an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour more antipathyous unto mine, then that of <hi>Silvander;</hi> upon all occaſions he hath thwarted me, and uſed all artifice to ſubvert whatſoever I intend; as in that unjuſt Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which he gave againſt <hi>Laonice,</hi> only becauſe I ſpoke for her; otherwiſe he could not be ſo groſſe as to prefer one that was dead, before ſo fair and accompliſhed a ſhephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe. Calling theſe things into my memory and conſideration, I had a conceit, that he read the Ordinances of this god after another manner then they are written, and only to croſſe me: Therefore I do conjure you, not only by your promiſe, but the honour you owe unto Love, and the deity of this place, that you will take ſo much paines as to fetch me hither thoſe Lawes, that I may read them my ſelfe, be ſatisfied in my doubt of <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and follow thoſe Lawes all the reſt of my life. Is this requeſt uncivill, <hi>Silvander,</hi> and unfit to be made unto a wiſe and vertuous ſhepheardeſſe? No, ſaid <hi>Silvander;</hi> but I rather think it in vain. No, ſaid <hi>Hylas;</hi> but let us make another promiſe to one another. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe me before all this Company, that you will follow thoſe Statutes which are there written, as long as you live, and I will do the like. I ſhall, ſaid he, moſt willingly; for I have long ſince promiſed the ſame unto the gods. You do promiſe then, ſaid <hi>Hylas.</hi> I do, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> and that without any reciprocall promiſe; for, I love you better, then to make you perjured. For my part, anſwered <hi>Hylas,</hi> I do ſwear unto you, calling to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the gods of this place, and let them puniſh, which of us two ſhall firſt fail. I do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> that ſeeing ſo great a change in <hi>Hylas,</hi> I ſhall moſt willingly let him ſee the twelve Statutes. Then going into the Arbor, and making an humble reverence, ſhe took them, and brought them unto this unconſtant Lover, who, with bare head and knee upon the ground, did ſay, I do receive theſe ſacred Lawes, as comming from a god, and brought by a goddeſſe, proteſting and vowing unto the great gods or this ſacred Grove, and calling all this Company as witneſſes, that I will all my life obſerve them as religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, as if the god <hi>Heſius, Tautates,</hi> and <hi>Tharamis</hi> had ordained them. Then riſing up, ſtill bare headed, he kiſſed them, and being invironed with all the Company, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to read them with a loud voice. But when <hi>Silvander</hi> heard him read, that one ought not to love infinitely: Fie, ſhepheard, ſaid he, read truly, and you will finde it otherwiſe. I think I do, ſaid he, and ſhewed them unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> who read them as he did. This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, (aid <hi>Silvander);</hi> then comming neerer, he deſired to ſee them. I ſee, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> that he who uſeth to deceive others, does think, others will deceive him: I doubt you will read them otherwiſe then they are writ. I ſhall read them truly, ſaid <hi>Silvander;</hi> but pray let me ſee them. Me-thinks (ſaid <hi>Hylas)</hi> it may ſuffice, that <hi>Phillis</hi> ſaw them, and you may very well truſt her. I ſwear (ſaid <hi>Phillis)</hi> that <hi>Hylas</hi> read as was written, and no otherwiſe: I cannot believe it ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> unleſſe I ſee. Then read them your ſelfe, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſo you will read them truly. Then <hi>Silvander</hi> took them, and ſwearing he would read them without any alteration, he began to read: But, when be found <hi>Hylas</hi> was in the right, he knew not what to think; and wondered more, when looking further, he found the ſenſe of every Verſe altered. Now Miſtris, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> what do you think? had I not good reaſon to ſuſpect <hi>Silvander,</hi> ſince, you ſee, he read quite contrary to what was wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten? Come, Shepheard, ſaid he to <hi>Silvander,</hi> what do you ſay to all this? Will you be a man of your word, or will you be falſe? <hi>Silvander</hi> anſwered not a word but was more amazed at this, than any adventure he ever met with; but ſtill looking upon the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:53526:143"/>
                  <hi>Diana</hi> came unto him, and looking alſo upon them, was alſo amazed: <hi>Silvander,</hi> ſaid ſhe, tell me upon your faith, and confeſſe the truth, when you readd them at the firſt, were they written as they are now? I proteſt, faireſt Miſtreſſe, ſaid he, when I readd them, they were not as they are now. Then <hi>Diana</hi> taking them into her hand, did look upon the writing a little neerer; which <hi>Hylas</hi> perceiving and fearing his jugling ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. Come, come, <hi>Silvander,</hi> ſaid he what needs all this talk? I am ready to keep my word, and will you be perjured? You take me very ſhort, ſaid <hi>Silvander;</hi> and believe it; I have ſome great ſuſpition of knavery; for I am ſure, that the Statutes which I ſaw, were as then I read them, and now I ſee they are quite contrary: ſo as I am much in doubt, that there is ſome fallacy. This is but a very bad excuſe, ſaid <hi>Hylas;</hi> how do you think a new Table could be made upon ſuch a ſuddain? As they were thus talking, <hi>Diana,</hi> who looked upon them very narrowly, ſhe found, that though the Inke was alike, yet there was ſome difference on ſome Characters, and then rubbing them with her finger, the new written went off, and the raſure appeared; then holding the Parchment betwixt the Sun and her eye, all the raſures and old writing eaſily appeared, which having found out: Now, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> I can end both your diſputes, for in one and the ſame place, you may finde what you both ſeek for; you, <hi>Silvander,</hi> may finde it written as you did read, and you <hi>Hylas,</hi> as you did correct it. Then comming to them, ſhe did demonſtrate it unto them both; for betwixt the Sun and the eye one might plainly ſee, where the Parchment had been ſcratched, and might, though dimly, ſee, what had been old written, and what newly. Every one of the Company did confirm what ſhe ſaid, and all flocking about <hi>Hylas:</hi> Come, ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, ſaid they, tell us truly how you did this. <hi>Hylas</hi> ſeeing himſelfe diſcovered by the ſtrict obſervance of <hi>Diana,</hi> was almoſt forced to confeſſe the truth; yet, not before he had ſworn many an oath that it was the injuſtice of thoſe Lawes, which moved him unto it; for, ſaid he, they are ſo very unreaſonable, as I could not poſſibly forbear correcting them as they ought to be. None could forbear laughing, to hear him talk ſo, but more, when they conſidered, into what a damp <hi>Silvander</hi> was ſtruck at the firſt. And becauſe it grew very late, and they had ſtayed very long in that place, <hi>Phillis</hi> would have carried back the Statutes to the place from whence ſhe had them: But all were of opinion, that it was fit they ſhould firſt be corrected as they were at firſt; and that <hi>Hylas,</hi> to extenuate ſome part of his offence, in entring into that place which he was forbidden, and for da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to falſifie the Statutes of Love, he was cenſured to eraſe all that himſelfe had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, which accordingly he did: More, ſaid he in obedience unto my Miſtreſſe, then to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the anger of Love or <hi>Silvander.</hi> Take heed, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> that this be not too much preſumption and infidelity Had <hi>Hylas</hi> heard theſe laſt words doubtleſſe he would have replyed; but he being gone into the Arbour, no anſwer was given. In the mean time, all the company went their waies, and took a little path which <hi>Silvander</hi> had choſen. And becauſe <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was out of hopes to hear any more newes of <hi>Celadon;</hi> that could pleaſe her, ſhe had a minde to return back, and in order to that, ſhe left <hi>Tircis,</hi> and came to him Me-thinks ſhepheard, ſaid ſhe unto him it is too late to go any further, and night will ſurpriſe us, before we can return to our Cabins. That's true, ſaid the ſhepheard; yet that, me-thinks, ſhould not hinder you from going on, ſince we are ſo neer the end of our journey; and though you ſhould return, the day would not ſerve you above halfe the way. But, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> where ſhould we lie? The place unto which I ſhall conduct you, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> is not far from the Temple of the good goddeſſe and I am ſure the venerable <hi>Chriſante</hi> will bid you all very welcome. I would know, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> whether this be agreeable unto my Companions. And then ſtaying till the way was a little broader, ſhe made <hi>Silvander's</hi> propoſition unto them. There was not one, who did not very well approve of it, ſince it was impoſſible to return unto their Townes by day light.</p>
               <p>In this reſolution then, they went on and <hi>Silvander</hi> not quitting <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> did ſhew her the Wood where he found the Letter, which cauſed this voyage. This ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> is a place very retired to receive any Letters in. You will more think it ſo, ſaid he, when you are there; for, it is the moſt ſalvage and rude place, and the leaſt frequented, of any about all the River <hi>Lignon.</hi> So as none could hit the way ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> except you and Love. For my part, ſaid he, I know what it is, and as for Love. I will be ſilent; for, I have heard ſay, that ſometimes when he would throw flames into a heart, he has burnt himſelfe; and who can tell whether he did not ſo, by the beauty of my Miſtris? and if any thing cure him, it is doubtleſſe the Fillet which he hath before his eyes. Ah <hi>Silvander!</hi> (ſaid the Shepheardeſſe) that Fillet does not hinder, but he can ſee when he pleaſeth, and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:53526:144"/>
hit ſo right upon the mark they are aimed at, as it is not likely one that's blinde did ſhoot them. I have ſeen, wiſe ſhepheardeſſe (ſaid <hi>Silvander)</hi> a blind man, who could hit the way unto every houſe, and turn at every turning in the Town, having gotten it by a long cuſtome. And why may we not well ſay, that Love, who is the prime and eldeſt of all the gods, hath by a long accuſtomacy, learned to hit the hearts of men, though he be blinde; and to ſhew you, that it is more by cuſtome then skill, obſerve, that he loves us only in the eyes, and yet hits our hearts: If he were not blinde, do you think he would wound with Love ſo many unequall perſons, Superious with Inferiours, and Shepheards with Queens. But I ſpeak this as a perſon intereſted, for I, that does not know what I am, it hath cauſed me to love <hi>Diana,</hi> whoſe merits are above the degree of any ſhepheards, and it hath made <hi>Paris,</hi> who is Son unto the Prince of <hi>Druides,</hi> to love a ſhepheardeſſe. As for your merits anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> you do equall the perfections of <hi>Diana,</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> by her vertue, doth tranſcend the grandure of <hi>Paris;</hi> ſo as the inequality is not ſo great, as to make you accuſe Love of blindneſſe. <hi>Silvander</hi> ſtood mute at this reply; not, but that he could eaſily have anſwered, but becauſe he was ſorry, he had by his words given know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his affection, and repented of them, fearing it would offend <hi>Diana,</hi> if ſhe ſhould know of it. But by good fortune, his words were well addreſſed; for <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> knowing what pure and ſincere affection he bore unto <hi>Diana,</hi> ſhe would moſt willingly have left him all aſſiſtance. And the nature of all ſuch as know how to love well, is, never to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the Love of another, unleſſe it be prejudiciall unto their own:</p>
               <p>By this time, they were come unto the Wood, and therefore <hi>Silvander</hi> ſaid unto her: This, wiſe ſhepheardeſſe, is the Wood which you have ſo much longed to ſee, but being already Sun-ſet, we have not time to view it. If we do finde in it, ſaid ſhe, as many rarities, as we did in that from whence we came, I ſhall think our journey and time very well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. With ſuch diſcourſe as this, they entred into the Wood, and it grew ſo dark, as they could not ſee one another, nor follow, but by the voice; then going further into the Wood, he ſo loſt his way, as he was forced to confeſſe, that he knew not where he was: The cauſe of this was a Plant over which he walked, which they of the Country do vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly call <hi>Wander-weed,</hi> becauſe it hath a quality, to make thoſe that tread upon it to wander out of their way, and, as the common bruit was, there was much of it in that Wood. Whether this be true or falſe, I cannot tell; but ſo it was, that <hi>Silvander</hi> and all the Company could not finde their way again all that night, though he turned and winded almoſt through all the Wood, and at the laſt, they were all ſo wildred, as they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to follow one another, by taking hold of each others clothes; for the night was ſo dark, as if it were ſo purpoſely, to hinder them from getting out of the Wood. <hi>Hylas,</hi> who by chance was got betwixt <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Phillis:</hi> I begin, Miſtreſſe, ſaid he, to hope well in the ſervice which I have done you. Why, ſaid <hi>Phillis?</hi> Becauſe, ſaid he you are very much afraid to loſe me and whereas I was wont to follow you, now you follow me.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, ſaid ſhe; but you muſt thank <hi>Silvander</hi> for it, whom you ſay is your greateſt enemy. I cannot tell ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> whether I ſhould more thank him for the favour I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from you, or chide him, for the pains I have taken. You may judge of that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> when you have put the pleaſures and the pains which you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, both into a ballance. I wiſh, Miſtris, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> that you would hold the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and judge which was the heavier. Every one did laugh at the good-will of <hi>Hylas;</hi> and <hi>Silvander,</hi> who heard it, anſwered him only thus: I confeſſe, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that I am a blind man, who leads many others. But the worſt is, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> they are blind only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they truſted too much unto your eyes. If you had been out of the Company, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> we had not been ſo blinde. Why, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> did I put out your eyes? No, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> but you did take away our means of ſeeing, holding us ſo long in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of your inconſtancy, and by falſifying the ſacred Lawes, which did put us upon the night. <hi>Silvander,</hi> ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> you put me in minde of thoſe, who when they had found good Wine, did blame it, becauſe they were drunk: Good friends (may the Wine ſay) why did ye drink ſo much? And good friend, <hi>Silvander,</hi> why did you hearken to me ſo long? Did I nail your ears to any poſt? No, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> there were ſtronger chaines in that company and place, then yours. But be it as it will, we are now ſo wandred out of the way, either by reaſon of the night, of by going over the plant <hi>Wonder-weed,</hi> as there is no hopes of getting into the way again, untill it be day, or at the leaſt, untill the Moon do ſhine. What's then to be done, ſaid <hi>Paris?</hi> No better courſe, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> then to reſt ourſelves under one of theſe Trees, untill the Moon do ſhew her ſelfe. Every one
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:53526:144"/>
approved of the motion: And the ſhepheards ſpreading all their Coats upon the ground, under the dryeſt Tree, the ſhepheardeſſes did ſit upon them, and ſo reſted altogether till the Moon appeared.</p>
               <p>Although the night was already far ſpent, when theſe ſhepheardeſſes did ſit themſelves down upon the Coats of the Shepheards; yet, being unaccuſtomed to ſuch a Canopy as the Cope of heaven, and unuſed to ſit upon the graſſe in the night, they talked a long while, before any ſleep did ſeize upon their eyes: And becauſe the horrour of the night did poſſeſſe them with fears, they laid themſelves cloſe upon an heap. <hi>Diana</hi> being next <hi>Mandonthe,</hi> did ask her, what fortune brought her into that Country? Wiſe <hi>Diana,</hi> anſwered ſhe, the ſtory of it is both too long and too tedious; let this, I beſeech you, ſerve for all, that the ſame Love that is ſo Regent in your Villages, hath as great a Soveraignty over Ladies and Knights; and it is it which brought me hither into this ſtate, although my quality hath raiſed me above it. If it be only your fears of being tedious to us, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> I dare undertake for all the Company, that this objection ought not to hinder you, from giving us a relation of it; for we have all longed to have the ſatisfaction from you: And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no time more convenient than now, ſince we are without the hearing of any ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard. The reaſon, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> why I in particular do deſire it, is, becauſe thoſe who ſee us aſſunder, do ſay, that we reſemble one another very much ſo as me-thinks, I am as much concerned in your fortune as my own, and obliged to enquire after it. It would be great glory unto me, ſaid <hi>Madonthe,</hi> to reſemble ſuch a Beauty as yours; but I wiſh, for your tranquillities ſake, that your fortunes may never reſemble mine. I am much obliged unto you, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> for your good will; but every one hath their own loads, and knowes beſt where the ſhoe doth pinch them, and others are not concerned further then by way of compaſſion: Therefore I beſeech you give ſatisfaction unto our requeſt Then I beſeech you give me leave, ſaid <hi>Mandonthe,</hi> to ſpeak in a low voice, that the ſhepheards, who are neer us, may not hear; for, I ſhould be extreamly aſhamed, they ſhould be witneſſes of my errours, eſpecially <hi>Therſander,</hi> for ſome reaſons which you ſhall underſtand by the ſequell of my diſcourſe. Then ſhe began in this manner.</p>

                  <hi>The Hiſtory of</hi> Damon <hi>and</hi> Mandonthe.</head>
               <p>IT is beſt for me, wiſe and diſcreet Company, to relate the ſtory of my life unto you by night, that darkneſſe may ſhadow my ſhame in relating my follies, for ſo muſt I praiſe thoſe occaſions, which made me quit the quality unto which I was born, and aſſume this in which you ſee me: For, though I am now in this habit, with a ſheep-hook in my hand, yet, I am no ſhepheardeſſe, but deſcended from Parents more noble. My Father, following the fortunes of <hi>Thierres,</hi> had gotten ſuch reputation of a Souldier, that in his abſence, he commanded all his Armies; not becauſe he was a Viſigot as he was, but becauſe he had great authority among the Aquitains. This King did ſo love and honour him, that he was obliged to dedicate himſelfe wholly unto him; in whoſe ſervice, beſides the Eſtate which he inherited from his Anceſtors, he ſo enlarged his poſſeſſions, as there was none in all <hi>Aquitain</hi> that could vie with him in riches. Having lived thus many years, his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt griefe was, that he had no other Child but me. And though his death was ſuddain, yet it was with ſo much honour, as I hold it to be the beſt piece of his fortune: For, after he had raiſed the Siege of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and purſued <hi>Attiles</hi> as far as the Cathalaunique Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>Thierres, Merovea,</hi> and <hi>Etius,</hi> gave him Battle. As fortune was, my Father fought that day upon the right hand of his King, who had the left Wing, and <hi>Merovea</hi> the Right; and almoſt the whole ſtrength of <hi>Attiles</hi> was upon <hi>Thierres</hi> ſide. After a long fight, the King of the Viſigots was killed, and my Father alſo, who, after he had received a hundred wounds, was found upon the body of his King, to defend whom, he received thoſe blowes which were made at him; which <hi>Torriſmond,</hi> his Succeſſor and Son, did take ſo well, as he buried his Father and mine both in one Tomb; and after the Battle was won engraved moſt honourable Inſcriptions, to his eternall memory. When my Father dyed, I was about ſeven or eight years of age, and began then to reſent the rigours of Fortune: For <hi>Leontidas,</hi> who ſucceeded my Father in his Charge, and whom <hi>Torriſmond</hi> loved above all the Cavaliers in <hi>Aquitain,</hi> did uſe ſuch artifice, as I was committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Guardianſhip, and almoſt raviſhed from my own Mother, under a pretence, which they called, Reaſon of State ſaying, that having ſuch great poſſeſſions, and ſo many places
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:53526:145"/>
of ſtrength he would ſee, that I married my ſelfe unto ſuch a one, as was very well affected unto the ſervice of <hi>Torriſmond.</hi> Thus was I deprived both of Father and Mother, the one, by death; the other, by reaſon of State: Yet, Fortune was ſo favourable unto me, in the honeſty and ſweetneſſe of <hi>Leontidas,</hi> that I could not deſire better offices then thoſe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him, nor wanted he any thing, but the name of a Father. But his Wife was of another nature, for ſhe uſed me ſo cruelly, as I may ſay, I could not hate death more then ſhe.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Leontidas</hi> his deſigne was, to educate me, untill I was at Marriage eſtate, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to beſtow me upon his Nephew, whom he intended to adopt his Heir, having no Children of his own. But conſtraint being the greateſt means to hinder a generous ſpirit from complacency, it hapned ſo, as his Nephew had never any affection unto me, nor I to him, both of us conceiving our Fortunes ſo noble, as we needed not any additions to make them greater. Theſe conſiderations, and ſome others more ſecret, did hinder our affections unto one another: But, when I came unto age of more diſcretion, I found greater impediments then theſe: For, the Courtſhip of many young Gallants, who addreſſed themſelves with abundance of honour and reſpect, made me think, the faint and hollow love of <hi>Leontidas</hi> his Nephew did diſhonour me. On the other ſide, he being vexed, that I ſhould ſo ſleight him, he retreated, ſo as I never ſaw him, but as a ſtranger, of which I was not a little glad. And though the reſpect which every one did bear unto <hi>Leontidas,</hi> by reaſon of the extraordinary favours which <hi>Torriſmond</hi> ſhewed him did ſtave off many from openly declaring themſelves; yet, there was a Cavalier, a neer Kinſman unto <hi>Leon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidas,</hi> who, notwithſtanding all thoſe conſiderations did undertake to ſerve me, though he had but ſmall hopes to obtain. At the firſt, he had no deſigne to embarque himſelfe in good earneſt, but only to keep himſelfe out of idleneſſe, and to make it appear, he had both merit and courage enough, to love and court the love, of her, that was eſteemed the higheſt Match in all the Court. When this young Gallant began to ſerve me, he was a man without any reſpect, violent, and quick, and ſo couragious, that the praiſe of Teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was more his due, than that of Valiant. But, ſince Love took him into diſcipline, he changed all his imperfections into ſo many. Vertues, and made him ſo amiable as ſince, he is grown the very pattern of civility and gallantry, unto all the Cavaliers of <hi>Torriſmond.</hi> His name was <hi>Damon,</hi> neer kinſman unto <hi>Leontidas,</hi> of whom the King had at the firſt no good opinion; but ſince he began to change, the King alſo changed his minde. But <hi>Leon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidas</hi> being one, that was extreamly obſervant of every ones actions, he took ſuch notice of his deſigne, that he could not endure him, becauſe he thwarted his aimes, of giving me unto his Nephew: And to give a ſtop unto this new courtſhip, he did ſo peremptorily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid me from ſeeing him, and him, from ſpeaking unto me, as both of us were extreamly offended at him. We, loving better becauſe forbidden had ever ſince a greater deſire to ſee each other than before, ſo as you may believe, that this prohibition was it only, which did oblige me to it. When <hi>Damon</hi> began firſt to court me, his humour was ſo diſpleaſing unto me, as I could not endure him; but, after <hi>Leontidas</hi> with menaces and harſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage did expreſly forbid me ſeeing him, and ſeemed to diſtruſt me: he vexed me ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, as I reſolved with my ſelfe never to love any other: And therefore I did with all poſſible diligence correct his vices, which his nature did moſt incline him unto; ſometimes blaming them in others and ſometimes telling him, that my humour was not to love thoſe that were addicted to them. Thus forming him into a new modell, when I ſaw the conditions of this young Cavalier were changed, I loved him much more, then if he had begun to ſerve me with the ſame qualities and perfections; for, every one is much better pleaſed with the works of their own hands, then any others: yet, I did carry my ſelfe ſo diſcreetly towards him as none could perceive that I did love him, and ſtood ſo upon my guard, as he had not ſo much boldneſſe, as to declare his minde unto me by his words: But at laſt, thinking that all his ſervice was loſt, if I did not know his intentions he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to take more heart, and put it to the venture: and becauſe he thought it more expedient to do it by Letter then Tongue, after a long diſputation in his minde, he writ this.</p>

               <p>He was not a little perplexed, how he ſhould bring it to paſſe, that I ſhould ſee this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for he knew, that I would not receive it unleſs by ſome Artifice. And ſee what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions Love hath. He came unto me ſeeming to entertain me with ſome Court-newes, and told me two or three paſſages which hapned very lately: at the laſt, he told me, that he had diſcovered a new League of Love, but feared to tell me the Parties; becauſe the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was one of my friends, and the Cavalier one of his. Why, ſaid I unto him, do you think me to be ſo indiſcreet, as I cannot conceal what is not fit to be known? Oh no, ſaid he; but my fear is, leſt you ſhould be an ill willer unto my friend.</p>
               <p>And why ſo, anſwered I? a pure and honeſt Love cannot offend any one. I plainly ſaw; (ſweet ſhepheardeſſes) that he was perplexed, and knew not what to do; but I could not imagine, that it was any buſineſſe concerning his own particular, ſince if he had any ſuch minde, he might have ſpok unto me long ſince, having had opportunities to do it: And therefore I was very urgent with him, and more perhaps then I ought to be. And at the laſt he told me, that as for their names, he durſt not tell them for ſeverall conſiderations, but he would let me ſee a Letter which he had found that morning. Upon this, he put his hand in his pocket, and ſhewed me the Letter which he had writ unto me, which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſcruple, I took and read, but knew not his hand, becauſe I had never ſeen it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But as I had before a little deſire to know their names, ſo after the reading of it, my deſire was extream, and was more urgent then before: At which he ſmiled, and put me off with ſome bad excuſes. Why <hi>Damon,</hi> ſaid I, will you not give me ſo much ſatisfaction, as to tell me what I ask? I am affraid (ſaid he) that I ſhall offend you, if I ſhould obey; for ſhe; unto whom this Letter is addreſſed is very much a friend of yours. Nay, certainly, ſaid I, you will much more offend me by your diſobedience. Then I am (ſaid he) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two great extreams; but, ſince the fault which I ſhall commit is by your command, it will be the leſſe, and therefore I will obey. Then taking the Letter, he read it aloud; but when he came to the end, he ſtopt, and named no body. See, faireſt Shepheardeſſe, the ſtrange effects of Love; ſometimes it hurries the pooreſt and baſeſt ſpirits into incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible impudence, and other times it makes the higheſt courage to tremble at ſuch things, as the meaneſt perſon would not dorre at.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Damon</hi> ſerves for an example of this; ſince he, whom no dangers could make ſtart, had not ſo much courage, as to tell his name unto a woman, and a woman, whom he knew, wiſhed him no harm. But, as his courage failed him, ſo my underſtanding more; for I might well have known by his fear, that it neerly concerned him; and I well believe, that it was Love which did infatuate me, intending by us, to make his puiſſance the better known unto others; otherwiſe, certainly I had ſeen it ſince I did love him, and ſince, they ſay, the eyes of Love looks though ſtone-walls. However it was, I muſt confeſſe, I did not apprehend it; and ſeeing him ſtand ſilent: What, <hi>Damon,</hi> ſaid I, muſt I know no more? Truly I did think, that I had a greater power over you then I ſee I have. From thence it is, anſwered he, that my ſilence proceeds; for, your too much power over me; makes me mute, and yet what I have ſaid might have ſufficed you; for what can I declare more, after I have read the Letter, and you heard my voice? How, <hi>Damon,</hi> (ſaid I to him, extreamly amazed) was't your ſelfe that writ it? It was I, ſaid he and he'd down his head and looked upon the ground. Then I beſeech you tell me, ſaid I, unto whom it is directed? Since it is your pleaſure to know it (ſaid he directly) it is unto the fair <hi>Mandonthe.</hi> Upon this word, he was ſilent, purpoſely, as I believe, to ſee how I would receive his declaration. I muſt confeſſe, I was much ſurpriſed, for I expected any other anſwer then that; and though I did love him, and that with a reſolved will; yet honour which ought to have the firſt place in our ſoules, did make me think, his words did offend me: And though I knew, that I my ſelfe was the cauſe of his boldneſſe, yet would I not excuſe him upon that, conceiving, that notwithſtanding he ought to have held his peace. The truth is, the love I had unto him was a good Advocate for him, and though it could not quite qualifie my reſentments of honour, yet it did infinitely ſweeten them. At the laſt I anſwered him thus: <hi>Damon,</hi> I did little expect this treaſon from you, in whom I durſt have truſted, as in my ſelfe; but, by this act, you have taught me never
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:53526:146"/>
to truſt in any young and raſh perſon; yet, I will not lay the whole blame upon you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I my ſelfe am partly guilty, in living with you heretofore as I have don: but, your over boldneſſe ſhall cauſe me to be more adviſed for the future; I ſhall hereafter take heed, both of you, and all that reſemble you. Madam, ſaid he unto me, if you call it treaſon to love you, I muſt confeſſe, I have betrayed you, and ſhall do as long as I live, knowing, that neither you, nor any in the world, can imagine the grandure of my affection: And if you do think, that my youth made me ſo bold, I ſhall maintain it againſt all men, that never was age more prudent then this youth, nor ever any prudence more wiſe then this temerity, which you blame me for. If I have failed, and that you are guilty of it, your manner of living with me is not the cauſe, but becauſe being ſo admirably fair, and full of all perfection, it is impoſſible any ſhould look upon you, and not commit the ſame fault. Alas, did you not tell me, that a pure and perfect Love could not offend any? And why ſhould you now judge otherwiſe againſt me? But, if my words do offend you, here's <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> that ſpoke them, offers his breaſt unto you, and the heart that adores you; chaſtiſe him as you ſhall pleaſe, and if he refuſe any thing you ſhall doom him unto (unleſſe forbidding him to ſerve you) hold him for the worſt of Traitors, and the moſt unworthy of your favours of any man alive. Had you been contented (ſaid I unto him) to have given me ſome teſtimonies of your affection, by your humble reſpect, and not by ſuch impudent lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, I had then found ſome reaſons to love you, as now I do to hate you. Do you think, <hi>Damon,</hi> I can put up theſe injuries without revenge? Do you not remember who my Father was? Have you been ignorant of my life, and what care I have had, not only to be as I ought to be, but alſo to preſerve my fame from all manner of ſcandall? Conſider theſe things, and if you do continue, you will make me perſecute you by all the waies I can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Madam (anſwered he preſently) never ſet before me any pains you can imagine; he that can endure the anger of your fair eyes, need not to fear all the torments in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. Do not think I am ignorant who you are, nor from whom you are deſcended; your vertues are too deeply engraved on my ſoul, and I am too much obliged unto thoſe, who gave you a beeing in the world, ever to loſe the memory of them. But if I have only of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended you in words, and not out of any deſigne, but to do you ſervice, forget, Madam, I beſeech you, and forgive my tongue; command me to be dumb, ſo you will let me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore you in my heart, and I will never ſpeak again. But, if you think your reputation, of which you are ſo juſtly tender, would be blemiſhed, by my telling the world that I love you, you would take the only way to force me unto it, if you ſhould do according to your menaces; for, it would be impoſſible, but my affection would break out, and ſo that which I now tell you in private, would be publiſhed all over the Court; and, would not that much more offend you? Before you pronounce your doom againſt me, I beſeech you, Madam, conſider well upon what I have ſaid, and that if my fault have diſpleaſed you, why ſhould you do worſe, in publiſhing it unto all the world?</p>
               <p>It would be a hard task for me (wiſe ſhepheardeſſes) to repeat all the reaſons which <hi>Damon</hi> alledged, and though I cannot expreſſe them well, yet I aſſure you he did. I muſt confeſſe, I do approve of their counſell as very good, who ſay, that a Lover ought not to declare his affection unto any Lady, before he have obliged her unto ſome kinde of good will unto him, for then the offence which ſhe receives by the declaration, will be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated; and ſhe will hearken unto his words with a more favourable ear. I did approve of it, I ſay, at this time by experience; for, I could not poſſibly part from him, though I did reſent the injury which he did me. And on the contrary, before our diſcourſe ended, I did conſent he ſhould love and ſerve me, ſo it was with honour and diſcretion. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Leontidas</hi> had his eye perpetually upon us, I commanded him not to ſee me ſo often; and, to deceive him, to diſſemble as well as poſſible he could. I do remember, that at that time, <hi>Leontidas,</hi> though a great and a wiſe Captain, yet was poſſeſſed with the love of ſome woman, who ſeeming to love him, did get what mony they could from him, yet in ſecret favoured others. <hi>Damon</hi> compoſed ſome Verſes, which he ſent unto me: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we feared, leſt if our Letters ſhould be loſt, our names would make known, what we deſired ſhould be ſecret: I called him Brother, and he me Siſter. I think that I remember the Verſes yet, which were theſe.</p>

               <p>But to return from whence I digreſſed. Ever ſince, <hi>Damon</hi> did ſo regulate and conform himſelfe unto my will as I could not deny, but that I did love him; and indeed, he was ſuch a one, as it was hard to do otherwiſe, eſpecially conſidering, how his affection unto me, had made him change his vices into vertues. And becauſe, to delude the eyes of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ontidas,</hi> we did not ſpeak together, unleſſe as we accidentally met, and never in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of any; many had an opinion, that the generous ſpirit of <hi>Damon</hi> would not long endure the diſdain which I uſed towards him, and that he was quite fallen off from me. <hi>Leontidas</hi> himſelfe was alſo deceived, though his Wife, who was of a very ſuſpicious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, did ſtill aſſure him of the contrary; and becauſe he did moſt paſſionately deſire to beſtow me upon his Nephew, to ſatisfie his minde, he ſet over me a Woman, whoſe office was, to be a ſpie over all my actions, without making any ſhew of it; her name was <hi>Leri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> and well in years, yet of a very pleaſing nature, but withall, as ſubtle and crafty as ever lived. I was not ſo quick-ſighted as <hi>Damon,</hi> for preſently he diſcovered the deſigne of <hi>Leontidas.</hi> But I, finding her to be very good company, and one that did ſtrive all ſhe could to pleaſe me, I could not believe ſhe had any bad intention. He, continually telling me, that ſhe would deceive me, and bidding me to take heed of her, we reſolved to go more ſubtlely to work: And becauſe it was not in our diſpoſe to turn her away, we thought it moſt expedient to ſeem, as if her company was very pleaſing and welcome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us: By this artifice we thought we ſhould oblige her, not to do all the ill offices ſhe could, but to make <hi>Leontidas</hi> think, that we had no deſignes, but what we were willing he ſhould know.</p>
               <p>Oh how well adviſed had we been, if we had put this determination into execution, after a more ſolid conſideration. <hi>Leriana</hi> ſeeing what carraſſes I uſed, did ſhew her ſelfe ſo deſirous to pleaſe me, that at the laſt, I began inſenſibly to love her: And ſhe on the other ſide, taking notice of the applications which <hi>Damon</hi> made unto her, did believe, that he loved her; and this beliefe, together with the beauty of this young Cavalier did quickly invite <hi>Leriana</hi> to love him, ſo as there was none of us, but poor <hi>Damon,</hi> who was not deceived; yet he payed the deareſt for our errours, though he knew all this from the firſt, yet could he not help it. I ſhall as long as I live remember the words he uſed, when he ſaid unto me: Siſter, you do love <hi>Leriana,</hi> but take heed ſhe deſerve it; I am afraid you will finde it, when it is too late her deſigne is naught, both againſt you and me; for, the Wife of <hi>Leontidas</hi> ſets her over you, only as a ſpie: And believe it, the carraſſes which you have commanded me to uſe unto her, has made her believe, that I love her, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe wiſheth me no harme. So much the better, Brother, (ſaid I unto him) for I know you cannot be in love with her, nor ſhall I be jealous. However, the good will ſhe bears unto you, will perhaps keep him within compaſſe, and hinder her from doing you any hurt. Pray heavens, Siſter, ſaid he, it falout ſo; but I am in fear, this affection will end quite contrary; for, it is impoſſible I ſhould continue my carraſses long unto her then, when ſhe finds her ſelfe deceived and ſleighted. Oh heavens, what miſchiefe will ſhe not be apt to do unto me? No, no, ſaid I unto him, ſhe can never think to win upon you by:
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:53526:147"/>
force. I pray god, replyed he, that I prove a bad diviner, and that ſhe do not do all ſhe can to do us miſchiefe. I did ſee, that this woman was very kinde unto him, but I could not imagine, ſhe could be in love with him, only thought, that her application to him, was out of her deſire to be complaiſant. Now though <hi>Leontidas</hi> did treat me with all poſſible ſweetneſſe, yet, the harſh uſage of his Wife, made me almoſt weary of my life. I told <hi>Damon,</hi> that he ought to conſider the miſerable life which I led; that I had no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, but in him, nor conſolation, but in <hi>Leriana;</hi> that I did not think, <hi>Leontidas</hi> and his Wife had any intentions of ſetting <hi>Leriana</hi> as a ſpy; or if they did, I thought they might be deceived, and that this woman thought her ſelfe ſo obliged by my carraſſes, as I am almoſt ſure ſhe loves me. <hi>Damon</hi> ſeeing me in this opinion, could do nothing but ſhrug his ſhoulders, and durſt never ſince ſpeak of it unto me, for fear of diſpleaſing me. And ſee what force this good opinion which we have of a perſon, hath over us: I did plainly ſee her applications unto <hi>Damon,</hi> but could not imagine it was with any bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions conceiving it to be only out of complacency. Oh how the vizard of diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on does diſguiſe vices, and makes us miſtake them for vertues? And upon this ground, I was very angry with <hi>Damon</hi> very often, conceiving he did not treat <hi>Leriana</hi> as he ought, ſince I had told him that I loved her, and that this was the leaſt thing he could do for me, to make much of thoſe whom I cheriſhed. This <hi>Damon</hi> knew well enough, and durſt not complain, leſt he ſhould make the matter worſe, only nouriſhed in his heart an extream hatred againſt her which he had much ado to hide. On the contrary, <hi>Leriana</hi> did ſo grow every day in affection to him, that ſeeing he took no notice of it, ſhe could not chuſe but write a Letter unto him, ſo full of paſſionate expreſſions, that <hi>Damon</hi> could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, but did put herſo out of hopes, as ſhe did not only ſtifle her love to him, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained a moſt deadly hatred in its room: Could ſhe have proved what ſhe knew of our affection, doubtleſſe ſhe would have done it, in accuſing him unto <hi>Leontidas;</hi> but our happineſs was, that what familiarity ſoever was betwixt us, I never ſpoke the leaſt thing of it before her; but, ſince that I found her ſo ſubtle and crafty, as I did believe, if ſhe could not have made any proofes, yet ſhe would notwithſtanding inform; but that which reſtrained her, as I thought, was her Letter which ſhe writ unto <hi>Damon,</hi> by which <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ontidas</hi> might have ſeen her to be but a bad woman; yet, this conſideration was nothing, becauſe ſhe might ſay that ſhe did ſeem to love <hi>Damon,</hi> only to inſmuate her ſelfe into the more credit: And doubtleſs <hi>Leontidas</hi> and his Wife had believed her, having entertained ſo good an opinion of her, as they thought her to be one of the graveſt and wiſeſt Matrous in all <hi>Gaul.</hi> But as I was miſtaken in my affection to her, ſo alſo <hi>Damon</hi> was much to blame; for, had he ſhewed me the Letter which <hi>Leriana</hi> writ unto him, doubtleſſe he had ſhewed me my errour, and we had not fallen into thoſe misfortunes, in which ſince we have lived; and the reaſon, as I think, why he did not, was, becauſe of his ſharp anſwer which he returned, fearing, if I ſaw it, I ſhould be angry with him. But however, he kept it ſo ſecret as I knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Leriana</hi> plotting revenge upon this Cavalier, ſhe conceived no way would bring it about, but ſuch occaſions as I ſhould give her, thinking, that keeping in familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with me, it was impoſſible but ſome occaſions would preſent themſelves, which would fit her purpoſe; and in order to that, ſhe courted me, and followed me as cloſe as my own ſhadow. She having a moſt notable piercing wit, which would dive into the very thoughts of perſons, ſhe found, that <hi>Therſander</hi> did love me; I ſay, this ſame <hi>Therſander</hi> whom you ſee here with me. It is requiſite (ſage Shepheardeſſes) that I acquaint you with his condition, as for his perſon, you ſee what it is; Be pleaſed to know therefore, that his Father following mine in all his martiall expeditions, they were both killed the ſame day <hi>Thierres</hi> dyed: And this <hi>Therſander</hi> being brought up of a child in my Fathers houſe; he conceived ſuch affection to me, as the difference of our qualities could not reſtrain him from looking upon me otherwiſe then he ought; and perhaps I might ignorantly be the cauſe of it, for the great inequality betwixt us, made me receive his ſervices, not as a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but as a domeſtick. But Love, who is blinde, did make him entertain ſuch thoughts, as were far from any grounds of reaſon: yet <hi>Leriana,</hi> who was far more ſubtle then I, having caſt her eyes upon him, and found out his intentions, ſhe thought him a fit ſubject for a begining of her revenge: She knew very well, that amongſt all the bitters of Love, there is none ſo ſharp as that of jealouſie, nor ſo eaſily infuſed into a ſoule that loves well; ſhe began therefore to inſinuate her ſelfe into familiarity with him, expreſſing much good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will unto him, offering him all the aſſiſtance that lay in her power; and briefly, did by
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:53526:147"/>
degrees get him acceſs unto me, and opportunities to ſpeak with me: But finding, that his modeſty would not permit him to declare his affection unto me, ſhe reſolved to infuſe more courage into him: And in order to that, one day when they were together, after ſome far-off diſcourſe, to be a prologue unto the main buſineſſe, ſhe told him, that ſhe and I had often wondered, he ſhould never make choice of any Miſtreſs, and that I ſhould ſay, I could not imagine the cauſe; that it could not be for want of will, for his age would not permit that; and therefore it muſt needs be want of courage, though if he did ſet himſelfe out, he might get the favour of the faireſt Lady in all the Court; and therefore that I could ſee nothing but that, or that he thought none worthy of him. <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander,</hi> who believed her, and who was touched to the very ſoul: Alas, alas, ſaid he, both my Lady and you, have but ill obſerved my actions, ſince you have not found out my follies. Alas, I do love, and do love in ſuch a place, that it is better for me to ſit ſtill in ſilence, then declare it, in any hopes of obtaining. Slie <hi>Leriana</hi> knowing his meaning very well, yet ſeeming not to underſtand him, did ſtill turn and winde her diſcourſe ſo, as ſhe got out of him the name of <hi>Mandonthe,</hi> but with ſo many excuſes, as ſhe ſaw it very requiſite to continue her deſigne, in infuſing more courage into him; and therefore ſhe told him, That ſhe ſaw no ſuch inequality betwixt me and him, but that he might very well go on; that though Fortune did not favour him with any great Eſtate, nor could derive his Pedigree from any great Anceſtours; yet, his vertues did ſupply thoſe defects, and made him equall to me in merit. All this ſhe told him, to make him the more confident of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and much more which ſhe invented; as, That ſhe knew by my words, that I did very much eſteem him, nay, love him, and was weary of <hi>Damon</hi> for his ſake, and would often ſay unto her, that <hi>Damon</hi> was changed into <hi>Therſander.</hi> Thus did ſhe infuſe as good a conceipt of himſelfe as poſſibly ſhe could. Having, thus laid a foundation for her treaſon, ſhe would now found how I ſtood affected; and ſometimes naming <hi>Damon,</hi> as if by chance, ſhe would ſtill be harping upon <hi>Therſander,</hi> and ſomething in his commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. All this I did not underſtand, for I had never caſt any eye upon him: And finding me to ſpeak of him as of a perſon indifferent, ſhe had an opinion, that I would receive Letters, if they were handſomely given unto me. The time of the year was at hand, when it was cuſtomary to preſent New-years gifts: She conceived, that a pair of perfumed Gloves would be a handſome cover for a Letter, and therefore procured one from <hi>Therſander,</hi> and put it into the finger of a Glove, and when ſhe ſaw her time, that the beſt and moſt company was with me, ſhe preſented her New-years gift unto me. By fortune, <hi>Damon</hi> was preſent; and becauſe ſhe feared, leſt meeting with it, I ſhould not make it known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every one, ſhe told me, that there was a ſeam unripped, and ſhe would mend it: Upon this, ſhe took that wherein the Letter was, leaving the other in the hands of thoſe that deſired to ſmell at it. But I finding the Paper in the finger, I asked what it was? To which ſhe anſwered, that it was the ſeam which rippeed when I tryed them. I, who did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this piece of ſubtlety, replyed, that it could not be ſo. She, with incredible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, anſwered, that ſhe her ſelfe had ripped it, and that I could not have it untill it was mended. I perceived, that there was ſomething which was to be diſſembled amongſt ſo much company; but I was too young and ſimple to apprehend it, or to diſſemble: Yet <hi>Damon,</hi> who had his eyes alwaies upon us, and who knew by experience how ingenious Love makes men, he preſently conceived, that there was ſome Letter in the Gloves, which muſt be concealed from him, but he could not deviſe from whom it ſhould be; as for <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander,</hi> he was out of all ſuſpition, yet, now he began to have ſome thoughts of him. For my part, though I had a deſire to do nothing but what was fitting; yet I had a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know, what it was which was in this Glove, and therefore retired as ſoon as I could. When I was alone, I took out the Letter, and opening it, I found theſe words.</p>

               <p>The flatteries of this Letter did pleaſe me, but comming from <hi>Therſander,</hi> I was aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them, wondring that ſuch a one as he ſhould dare to look upon me in this way: I was alſo offended with <hi>Leriana,</hi> thinking it ſtrange ſhe ſhould be the bringer of any ſuch Letters; and I was long in conſultation with my ſelfe, whether I ſhould complain of her, or take no notice of it: I reſolved at the laſt to tell her, that I had throwne it into the fire, and never read it; and becauſe I would flie all occaſions, as well to ſtop all reports, as becauſe I would have no occaſion to put away <hi>Leriana,</hi> whoſe humour was very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto me; and though I knew ſhe was in a fault, yet my youth, and the affection I had unto her, conſtrained me to forget it, and to ſeek for excuſes in her behalfe. A few daies after, ſhe came unto me; and becauſe I did not wear the Gloves which ſhe gave me, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an opinion they came from <hi>Therſander,</hi> as well as the Letter, ſhe asked me, what I had done with them? I have given them away, ſaid I unto her, becauſe they were not fit for my hand. And the Paper within them, ſaid ſhe, what have you done with it? I threw it into the fire, anſwered I; was it of any importance? Did you not read it, ſaid ſhe? And I anſwering, No: She ſaid, that ſhe was very glad of it, becauſe ſhe was deceived by one whom ſhe truſted but ſhe thanked god, that the fire had purged away the fault.</p>
               <p>What was it, (ſaid I unto her)? You ſhall never know from me, ſaid ſhe; and I aſſure you, that ſince I did know what it was, which was within this houre, I was extreamly afraid you ſhould have read it, and came now purpoſely to hinder you. This crafty wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man did think, that I had read it; but finding me not ſo well diſpoſed as ſhe deſired, ſhe thought it neceſſary to imprint a good opinion of her ſelfe in me, and to diſsemble as well as I. And becauſe ſhe knew I loved <hi>Demon,</hi> ſhe accuſed me with it, and condemned it; thinking that ſhe could not build her deſignes upon a better foundation, then the ruines of that affection which I bare unto this Knight; and therefore ſhe turned her wits wholly to ruine it: And becauſe ſhe knew very well, that I had no ill opinion of my ſelfe ſhe fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, that <hi>Damon's</hi> affection unto me, was the cauſe of mine unto him; her deſigne was therefore, to put me into ſome doubts of him, conceiving there was no better way then jealouſie, and that a generous ſpirit does more reſent diſdain, then any other offence: And though jealouſie may proceed from ſeverall cauſes, yet the principall is, when a Lover ſees the party Loved, loves another, taking this new affection for an argument of diſdain, and conceiving, that as ſhe whom he loved did merit all his love, ſo alſo he ought to have all hers; in which ſhe failing, he doth attribute it unto diſdain.</p>
               <p>But when ſhe went about to execute her deſigne, ſhe found it to be a piece of no ſmall difficulty, ſince this Cavalier did not look upon any woman but my ſelfe; beſides, it was requiſite, that <hi>Leriana</hi> ſhould have ſome power over her, of whom ſhe ſhould make me jealous, to the end, ſhe might the better mould her unto her ends; moreover, that ſuch a one be ſecret, and fair, and of ſuch a quality, as might ſeem probable ſhe deſerved to be loved; it was very hard for her to finde all theſe qualifications in one perſon: But ſhe, whoſe acute wit never found any thing impoſſible, after many a daies queſt, in vain; at laſt, reſolved upon a Niece, whom ſhe brought up, and to ſupply all defects by her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety. This was a young wench, whoſe name was <hi>Ormanthe</hi> young, both in age and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who indeed was owner of a fair face, but ſo ſhallow in all attracts of Love, as very few deemed her fair; yet notwithſtanding, <hi>Leriana</hi> had an opinion, that ſhe could ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct her, that where nature was defective, her art would ſupply. In order to this, ſhe took <hi>Ormanthe</hi> to task, chid her for the little care ſhe had of her ſelfe, told her, ſhe might be aſhamed to ſee all her Companions courted and loved, who were much leſſe fair then ſhe was, and that ſhe could not oblige the meaneſt Cavalier to love her; ſhe told her, all this proceeded from her careleſſneſſe and want of wit, and that for her part if ſhe did not reſolve upon better courſes, ſhe would ſend her home to her Mother; for, if ſhe ſtayed any longer in the Court, ſhe would arrive at no other title, but an old Maid. <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> fearing that her Mother would give her but coorſe treatment, if <hi>Leriana</hi> ſhould ſend her home, ſhe fell down upon her knees, with tears in her eyes, and beſeeched her to pardon all her faults, and promiſed, that for the time to come, ſhe would wholly conform her ſelfe unto her will. <hi>Leriana</hi> ſeeing ſo good a beginning, continued: <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> ſaid ſhe, all theſe tears and proteſtations will be in vain, if I do not ſee you change your behaviour and way of living; all your Companions are courted, and you are the only one that is
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:53526:148"/>
not. Do you think it is not a great griefe unto me, to ſee all the young Beauties in the Court waited upon, and when they walk, every one hath her Gallant to lead her, nay, ſome two or three, and you the only one that none looks upon? This, believe it, is a great diſgrace unto you. Thoſe who look you in the face, and finde it fairer then moſt of your Companions, muſt needs ſay, that if you be not courted, it muſt be, becauſe you are poor, or that there is ſome fault, either in your Race, or in your Perſon: And truly, all this proceeds from your careleſſneſſe, and from your rude and ruſtick nature, which makes every one to ſhun you. And indeed, I know that <hi>Damon</hi> has a good minde to love you; I know it, becauſe he has got ſome of his friends to tell me as much, and yet he can never finde a way how to approach you, you are ſo inacceſſible, and becauſe your retired humour will never give him an opportunity; he is the greateſt Gallant in all the Court, and this would be a great honour unto you. Should this good fortune preſent it ſelfe unto any one of your Companions, Oh! how welcome it would be? What induſtry and artifice would they uſe to bring it to paſſe? <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> let me tell you this once for all, if I do keep you here in Court any longer, I ſhall expect, and deſire you ſhall give, all occaſions unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to love you, and do not fear, to let others ſee the favours you do him; for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne being to marry you, he will not think them diſadvantageous to him. This was the lecture which <hi>Leriana</hi> read unto this young Wench: And truly, it was ſeed not ſowed in barren ground, but produced plentifull effects. <hi>Ormanthe</hi> being naturally of a free and affable humour, without any diſſimulation, and being put forward by <hi>Leriana's</hi> inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſhe did ever ſince that day apply her ſelfe with ſo many carraſſes unto <hi>Damon,</hi> that he and all that ſaw it did wonder: The noiſe of it went ſo far, as I came to hear of it, and that by the artifice of <hi>Leriana,</hi> who by the means of <hi>Therſander,</hi> cauſed it to be ſpoken of in a place, where I might come to know of it; and to the end I ſhould think there was no jugling in the buſineſſe, <hi>Therſander</hi> never ſpoke of it, but cauſed ſome of his friends. However, I could not believe, <hi>Damon</hi> could love this fooliſh Wench better then me; ſince me thought, her beauty did not equall mine, as my Glaſs aſſured me: Moreover, when I conſidered my extraction and <hi>Ormanthe's,</hi> I could not imagine, he ſhould be ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in his choice, as to ſleight me for ſuch a one; which this crafty <hi>Leriana</hi> knowing very well, ſhe was put upon a greater piece of artifice. There was an old woman, Aunt unto <hi>Leriana,</hi> who had lived all her life in much honour and reputation: <hi>Leriana</hi> did contrive the matter ſo, as this good old woman was acquainted with the carraſſes, which <hi>Ormanthes</hi> uſed unto <hi>Damon,</hi> which were ſuch, as when ſhe heard of them, ſhe could not reſt untill ſhe ſent for <hi>Leriana;</hi> and ſhe ſent for her, to meet her in my Chamber, purpoſely that I might ſee when ſhe ſpoke unto her. Their diſcourſe was long, and the anger that I obſerved in them, made me deſirous to know (when this good old woman was gone) what the matter was. She ſeemed very unwilling to tell me, and ſtood a long time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an anſwer: At the laſt, becauſe I was very urgent with her, ſhe ſaid thus unto me. See, Miſtreſſe (for ſo ſhe called me) how ſubtle <hi>Damon</hi> is; but yet, not ſo ſubtle as my ſelfe: he thought, that by his feigning love to you I ſhould not ſee the affection which he bears unto <hi>Ormanthe:</hi> This ſubtlety had been good, had it been unto any other but my Niece; but, this doth ſo neerly concern me, that I muſt needs look neerly unto it; and he hath carried the matter ſo far beyond all prudence, as he muſt needs be blind that doth not ſee it. I think, that I have been told of it by above a hundred perſons, and this good old woman came hither purpoſely to tell me of it; it is growne the common talk, and ſo diſhonourable to my Niece, as I were to blame if I did ſuffer it, ſince ſhe is under my charge. I have chid <hi>Ormanthe</hi> many times for it, but I think he hath bewitched her: For my part, I know not which way ſhe takes him; for, though ſhe be my Niece, yet, I muſt needs ſay, there is not any one more unlikely to make one in love with her, then ſhe. Oh! how theſe words went to my heart? I retired into my Cloſet, whither this crafty woman followed me, being too well experienced in ſuch accidents, to be ignorant of the operation theſe words had in me. And becauſe I did put my whole confidence in her when we were alone, it was impoſſible for me to reſtrain my tears, or conceal from her my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which I had ſo long hid. Oh! what extream contentment <hi>Leriana</hi> received by this declaration: And though her whole deſigne was only to divert me from the love of <hi>Damon;</hi> yet, ſhe knew it was not yet time to ſtrike, but muſt firſt weaken it a little more, before ſhe did down-right attempt it: And in order to that, ſhe would needs make me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that ſhe was very much a friend unto that Cavalier, purpoſely, becauſe I ſhould not miſtruſt her; and therefore ſhe ſpoke thus unto me: I muſt confeſſe, Miſtreſſe, that you
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:53526:149"/>
have eaſed my heart; yet I am ſorry, I ſhould buy my eaſe at the expence of your ſorrowes. Had I thought that <hi>Damon</hi> had loved you, I ſhould never have feared his loving my Niece; he is a man of better judgment, then to change you for any other, it is only but ſome flaſh of youth, which makes him go a little aſtray from you, he will return again, I warrant you; and therefore let not this withdraw your affection from him: However, I make no doubt, but this act does much afflict you, and diſpleaſeth you as much, as if it were ſome grand injury; and the reaſon is, becauſe Love is a child, and is offended at a trifle. But, Miſtreſſe, let it not trouble you any more; if you will but uſe a remedy which I ſhall preſcribe, you ſhall both be preſently cured, I will warrant you. Do you not know, that an over great light doth dazle? and that too great a noiſe doth deaf? So perhaps the beams of your affection, ſhining too freely upon him, hath leſſened his love; for my part, I am apt to believe it ſo: I know, young ſpirits are ordinarily ſubject unto ſuch things, and being too well aſſured of what they enjoy, they grow careleſſe, and kick at abundance, which does beget in them new deſires. But againſt this diſeaſe, as againſt many others, contraries muſt be applied. I am confident, that if you did but ſeem a little to withdraw from him, he will preſently return to his duty, and cry you mercy for his fault. You may believe, Miſtreſſe, that I do love you, becauſe I uſe this language unto you; and I do give you the ſame counſell, as, if it were my caſe, I would take my ſelfe. In concluſion, this cunning Piece of ſubtlety ſo diſſembled the matter, as, with many thanks, I promiſed to follow her counſell. It hapned, that <hi>Damon</hi> finding me ſomething faint towards him, and laying the blame upon the carraſſes which <hi>Ormanthe</hi> uſed towards him, did by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees withdraw from her, and ſhunned her as much, as if he had been the Woman, and ſhe the Man. <hi>Leriana</hi> took notice of it as well as I; and not to let ſlip any good occaſion, one day, when we were by our ſelves in my Cloſet, ſhe asked me, whether her counſell was not good? and whether I would not believe her another time? And I anſwering, Yes: She continued; Then, Miſtreſs (ſaid ſhe) we-muſt do as good Phyſicians uſe to do, who having prepared the humours by ſome ſleight medicines, do afterwards draw them quite away by remedies more ſtrong. I will acquaint you with an art, which I have ſeen much uſed amongſt Lovers. There is nothing which a Lover does more ſharply reſent, then paugs of jealouſie, nor which awakens him more, nor will ſooner make him return to his duty: If <hi>Damon</hi> were a little touched with it, you ſhould ſee how ſoon he would return, how he would caſt himſelfe at your feet, and acknowledge his offence. I could not chuſe but laugh when I heard theſe words, thinking, that I was not able to obtain ſo much power over my ſelfe; yet conſidering, what good effects her firſt counſell produced, I reſolved to believe her in this: But, (ſaid I unto her) of whom ſhall we make uſe of for this buſineſſe? She durſt not propound <hi>Therſander</hi> unto me, becauſe of the former paſſages, but ſhe had a deſire it ſhould proceed from me, and therefore ſhe anſwered me thus: This queſtion, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, is very pertinently asked, and it muſt be adviſedly thought upon; for, he muſt be ſuch a one, as will not hurt your reputation, and therefore I do conclude, he muſt be one, of whom you may abſolutely diſpoſe, and one, ſo far inferiour to you, as you may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw when you pleaſe, and he not dare to be offended, or that every one ſhould believe you did but fool him. Then looking upon the ground, and ſcratching her head, as if ſhe were much puzled to finde out one, upon a ſudden ſhe looked upon me, and ſaid; Why ſhould we look ſo long for one that is ſo neer? who better then <hi>Therſander,</hi> you may do what you pleaſe with him, and he dare not be offended; beſides, he is diſcreet, and has no ſmall affection unto you already; ſo as I cannot imagine one more fit for ſuch a purpoſe then he. When ſhe named <hi>Therſander,</hi> I remembered the ſormer paſſages, and did think, that ſhe made choice of him ſooner then any other, becauſe ſhe loved him; but alſo I knew, that his quality and diſcretion was ſuch, as were very ſuitable for the buſineſſe which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him for: And though my high ſpirit did forbid me to caſt my eyes upon one of ſo mean a rank; yet, my affection unto <hi>Damon,</hi> and my deſire to recall him, did make me condeſcend unto <hi>Leriana's</hi> counſell: And therefore I began to look with a more favourable aſpect upon <hi>Therſander,</hi> and to talk with him; but it was with much ſhame, when I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any ſaw me. <hi>Damon,</hi> whoſe affection was extream, did preſently perceive this alceration. And <hi>Leriana</hi> told <hi>Therſander,</hi> that his diſcreet and humble carriage unto me, had wrought ſuch good effects, as that I loved him almoſt as well as he loved me. The leaſt ſhadow of a favour from me, ſeemed to be great and ſubſtantiall; and though I did behave my ſelfe to him in a way of indifferency, yet, the leaſt ſyllable I ſpoke, was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable ſentence; and this made him to brisk up himſelfe, and look bigger then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:53526:149"/>
and all by the falſe hopes which this ſubtle woman had infuſed into him: So as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſoon obſerved all this; &amp; calling to minde the Letter which he ſaw me receive in a pair of Gloves, and from thence drawing many diſadvantageous coucluſions, both againſt himſelfe and me, he did believe, that through the ſolicitations of <hi>Leriana,</hi> I had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the affection of <hi>Therſander,</hi> and rejected him. After he had patiently endured thus a while, in hopes of ſome change, but finding none, he being not able to endure it any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, reſolved to upbraid me with it; and becauſe <hi>Leriana</hi> was continually with me, he could not poſſibly finde any opportunity of ſpeech with me, unleſſe in the Chamber of <hi>Leontidas:</hi> And therefore, as I was riſing from the Table, and far off this woman, he ſeeing that he could have no better occaſion, did cloſe with it, and ſaid unto me: Is all this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have a minde to kill me, or becauſe you would try, how a perſon that loves infinitely can endure rigour? I anſwered him faintly, Your death does concern me no more, then my rigours concern you. He would have replyed, but <hi>Leriana</hi> came to us, and by her preſence, conſtrained <hi>Damon</hi> to be ſilent; and beſides, I turned towards her, and did not give him the leaſure. This crafty woman looking upon me, did make a ſigne, that this was an effect of her advice, and afterwards whiſpering in my ear; This ſaid ſhe, is a very good beginning, continue your ſleighting him, and you ſhall ſee a ſtrange operation. Ah, moſt ſubtle woman! ſhe had good reaſon to ſay, a ſtrange operation; for it did operate ſo, as made me as miſerable a woman as ever was. So, ſage Shepheardeſſes, I did continue ſleighting him, and would not daigne ſo much, as to turn towards this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, who went out of the houſe ſo much out of himſelfe, as he was ready to ſheath his Sword in his own breaſt; and I believe, had not his intention of killing <hi>Therſander</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained him, he had executed this ſtrange reſolution againſt himſelf: And that which hindred him from falling preſently upon <hi>Therſander,</hi> was his fear of diſpleaſing me, knowing that it would be a great wound unto my reputation, if, upon that account, he ſhould aſſault him; and therefore, when the ſury of his paſſion was a little cooled, he went on, and ſtudied for ſome other pretence of quarrell. When he met <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her cuſtome, came, and took him about the neck he was in no very good humour, did puſh her a little back, and told her, That he wondred ſhe was not afraid of that cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which all people would give upon ſuch actions. Whom ſhould I fear, or care for, (ſaid ſhe) ſo I be but pleaſing and welcome unto you? Were it of no other, ſaid <hi>Damon,</hi> yet you ought to ſtand in fear of <hi>Leriana.</hi> Of <hi>Leriana</hi> (ſaid ſhe and laughed)? <hi>Damon,</hi> you are deceived, for I am ſure, that I cannot pleaſe her better, then to carraſſe and make much of you. This Cavalier knowing, that <hi>Leriana</hi> wiſhed him ill and hearing theſe words, did preſently ſuſpect ſome treaſon; which to prevent, and taking <hi>Ormanthe</hi> aſide, he deſired her to tell him, how ſhe knew, that <hi>Leriana</hi> would be pleaſed with her for this? <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> who was far from a deep Polititian, and who thought, to excuſe her ſelfe, by laying the fault upon her Aunt, ſhe told him all the diſcourſe of <hi>Leriana,</hi> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ſhe had laid upon her ſo to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Damon,</hi> who was very wiſe, after he had a little thought upon it, did plainly ſee, that the change in my affection did proceed from an opinion, that he loved this Wench; and ſeeming to take no notice of it, he left her, with a reſolution to tell me, let <hi>Leriana</hi> ſay what ſhe would. Fortune, it ſeemed, favoured him with a fit opportunity; for the ſame day, <hi>Torriſmond</hi> intended to hunt; and becauſe the Queen was wont to accompany him, I, with the reſt of my Companions, took horſe, and waited upon her. The Stag being rouſed, and all the Doggs following full cry after him, all the Company full ſpeed fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after the Chaſe. Now began all the Hunters to part; thoſe who had the flighteſt Horſe, left the reſt behinde them. <hi>Damon,</hi> who was well mounted, kept his eye ſtill upon me, and ſeeing me ſeparated from all the Company, he took into a way which he thought I would paſſe; and feigning that his Horſe had fallen upon him, he ſeemed as if he had hurt his leg; and to procure the more beliefe of it, he dirtyed his head and ſhoulder on the one ſide and his Horſe alſo, giving his Man charge to keep at a diſtance. When I was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the way, he croſſed it, and taking my Horſe by the Bridle, he ſtayed him; at which I was much ſurpriſed, fearing, that his love had tranſported him beyond his diſcretion: but fearing, that if I ſhould ſeem too fearfull, he would grow more bold; I made a vertue of neceſſity, and ſpoke to him in a confident tone, ſaying: What do you mean, <hi>Damon?</hi> how dare you be ſo bold as to interrupt me in my way? Neceſſity, Madam, anſwered he, which hath no Law, hath conſtrained me to commit the fault: if, after you have heard me, you ſhall deem it worthy of puniſhment, I will promiſe you to receive it, or any thing
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:53526:150"/>
that ſhall give you ſatisfaction. Then lifting his eyes up to heaven: Oh ye gods, (ſaid he) who hear and ſee the ſecrets of all diſſembling hearts, be witneſſes unto what I ſhall ſay unto this fair One, and if I do not ſay truth, you are not juſt, if you do not puniſh me before her fair face. Then turning towards me; I will not at this time, fair <hi>Mandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,</hi> (ſaid he) either excuſe my ſelfe, or accuſe you, for the choice you are pleaſed to make of <hi>Therſander</hi> before me, and your forgetting ſo many vowes and oaths which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the gods to witneſſe: But I muſt needs complain againſt my fortune, which will not let me avoid that miſery, which I do foreſee. As ſoon as ever <hi>Leriana</hi> came to you, me thought ſome <hi>Daemon</hi> foretold me, of the harm which ſhe would do me; you know, how oft we reſolved never to confide in her; but, my bad deſtinies, more ſtrong then all our reſolutions, hath made you change your minde, and would needs have you to love her: If you do but finde any contentment in it, though I endure the moſt cruell torments that ever ſoul ſuffered; I ſhall thank the gods, and pray them to continue it. But, it being a thing impoſſible for me to leave you in any doubt of my fidelity; and though I know it will be in vain, and that you will not credit it; yet, I muſt needs tell you, how maliciouſly and craftily ſhe hath ruined all my happineſſe. Then he told me, how <hi>Leriana</hi> loved him, how ſhe had carraſſed him, how he rejected her, and how deadly ſhe did hate him for this refuſall; and to verifie what he told me, he ſhewed me the Letters which ſhe had written unto him, and acquainted me with the counſell and inſtructions ſhe gave <hi>Orman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,</hi> to apply her ſelfe unto him, only to make me believe, he was in love with her; and acquainted me, how he came to the knowledge of all this, and how this malicious woman did not value the honour of her Niece, ſo ſhe could thereby ruine me, and make you love <hi>Therſander,</hi> which ſhe knew ſhe could never do, but by raviſhing from me the honour and happineſſe of your favour. But Oh ye gods! is it poſſible ſhe ſhould ever bring it to paſſe? can I ſo much as ever doubt it, ſince I ſaw the Letter in the Gloves, and ſince I ſee you ſo kinde unto him, that is ſo much unworthy of you? But, what better evidence then your own words, can I have to aſſure me, that I am moſt miſerable, that I am condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that I am for ever loſt?</p>
               <p>Well, <hi>Mandonthe,</hi> ſince it is my bad fortune to be a cauſe, that the generous ſpirit which I ever knew to be in you, is not only ſtained with Inconſtancy, but with a choice that is baſe and diſhonourable; I am reſolved not to ſurvive your affection, but will make it appear, that I have love enough to waſh away your offence with my blood. Imagine, wiſe <hi>Diana,</hi> how I was amazed at this expreſſion; I was ſo ſtruck with fear, as I could not anſwer him, or ſpeak one word of a long time. And when I began, with intention to give him all the ſatisfaction he could deſire, I ſaw the Chaſe comming upon us, and it was ſo neer us, as, not to be ſeen alone with <hi>Damon,</hi> I was conſtrained to part from him, and had not time to ſay any more but this: Truth ſhall alwaies prevail. Then ſwitching my Horſe, I rid into the Wood, very ſorry that I could not give him a better anſwer. I would have commanded him to follow me if I durſt, but I was afraid any ſhould ſee us together, and therefore referred it untill a better occaſion. Now obſerve, I beſeech you, how the gods does mock at mortall prudence; I made choice of the next morning, to put poor <hi>Damon</hi> out of his pain, and it was that day which brought him more torment.</p>
               <p>I need not tell you how he paſſed away that night, it is eaſily imagined that he had not any good reſt; but, as ſoon as day came, he went out of his Chamber; and it being about the houre I was uſed to riſe, he went to walk in a Gallery, out of which, he might ſee into my Chamber, when the dore was open, intending to go in, as ſoon as he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that I was out of my bed. But, as fortune was, I awaked very late that morning, as well, becauſe I was weary with hunting the day before, as becauſe I ſat up very late, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and muſing upon the Letters which <hi>Leriana</hi> writ unto him, and he had given unto me: In which I found ſuch ſupplications and expreſſions, as were moſt unworthy of any woman; for in the concluſion of one of them, I found theſe words: <hi>Accept, Oh deareſt and lovely</hi> Damon, <hi>the prayers of her, that wholly gives her ſelfe unto you, upon no other condition, but only to be yours; and this, if not out of Love, yet, I beſeech you, out of Pitty.</hi> Truly I was extreamly aſtoniſhed at it, and I vexed ſo, that I ſhould be ſo extreamly deceived, as I could not cloſe my eyes a long time after I was in bed. But whilſt <hi>Damon,</hi> as I told you, was walking in this Gallery, <hi>Leriana,</hi> who ſaw him there, would try, whether a Lover could be put to death by diſpleaſure; for, having found <hi>Therſander</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo at the ſame time, ſhe carried him unto a window, juſt under that on which ſhe ſaw <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> leaned ſometimes, when he was weary with walking; and having obſerved, that he
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:53526:150"/>
was there at that time, ſhe ſpoke thus unto <hi>Therſander,</hi> in a voice loud enough, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to be heard: And to the end you may know, dear Brother, that <hi>Mandonthe</hi> does really love you, and that ſhe does but laugh at all thoſe, who think ſhe loves them, ſhe commanded me yeſterday, when ſhe came from Hunting, to give you this Ring, which ſhe cauſed to be made purpoſely for you: She deſires you to love her, and to wear it as a ſymbol of your affection; ſhe hath another, which ſhe wears her ſelfe, juſt like it, which ſhe will alwaies wear, as an aſſurance, that her will ſhall never differ from yours, more then the Ring ſhe ſends you differs from hers. Oh heavens! what treaſon is this? Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſuch villany ſhould be invented by any human ſpirit? For the truth is, I had a Ring juſt like that which ſhe gave him, and had worn it long; and this wicked Devill got an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to be ſecretly counterfeited, purpoſely for this end. <hi>Damon,</hi> who, as I told you, leaned upon the window, and hearing her voice, did preſently know it, and leaning his head further out of the window, to hearken more attentively, he heard all theſe words that I have told you: And becauſe ſhe did put her arme out of the window, purpoſely that <hi>Damon</hi> might ſee the Ring, he remembered very well, that he had ſeen me have ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And whilſt he was thus leaning himſelfe out of the window, he heard <hi>Therſander</hi> anſwer her: I ſwear by all the gods (ſaid he) that this Ring is ſo beyond all expreſſions welcome unto me, as I do wiſh <hi>Mandonthe</hi> may never love me, if I do not wear it to my grave, as a teſtimony, that I am eternally hers, and that it is infinitely dearer unto me, then my own heart. Upon this, he took it, and after many kiſſes, he put it upon his finger.</p>
               <p>Whether or no <hi>Damon</hi> was tranſported, and whether he had not reaſon to tranſgreſſe the limits of duty, I leave you to judge, wiſe <hi>Diana;</hi> and yet, he had ſo much power over himſelfe in his anger, as he neither did nor ſaid any thing, which could give any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, leſt if any knew it, he might be hindered in the execution of his deſigne. At the ſame time, the Queen went into the Temple, to be preſent at the ſacrifices which were offered almoſt every morning; and becauſe <hi>Lcontidas's</hi> Wife never left her, I went alſo, as the reſt of the Court Ladies did; of which, <hi>Damon</hi> not being advertiſed untill we were all in our Coaches, he took Horſe, and overtook us, as we were entring into the Temple. And ſee how unfortunate we were, I was fully reſolved to admit of all his excuſes, and to aſſure him that I did love him, what demonſtrations ſoever I had given to the contrary; and to make good my words, I would have broke off all friendſhip with <hi>Leriana,</hi> and all familiarity with <hi>Therſander,</hi> and ſought out for opportunity to tell <hi>Damon</hi> as much. But he, being abuſed by the treaſon of falſe <hi>Leriana,</hi> when he ſaw me, he looked with ſuch an angry brow, and ſo ſleighted me, as I became offended with him, not knowing or i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magining what cauſe he ſhould have ſo to do; yet, preſently after, remembring how I had made him jealous, I did excuſe him. We all went into the Temple, and the ſacrifice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, during which, I obſerved, that he looked upon me very often, but, with ſuch angry eyes, and brow beating frownes, as plainly ſpoke him to be very much tranſported. But hear, I beſeech you, into what an extaſie this paſſion did hurry him: When the ſacrifice was offered, and every one in the midſt of their zeal and devotion upon their knees, he roſe up, and with a loud voice uttered theſe words: Oh great god, who art adored in this ſacred place, by all this devout aſſembly; if thou beeſt juſt, why doſt thou not puniſh a ſoul, that is the moſt perfidious, and moſt cruell, in all the world? I demand juſtice of thee in her preſence, to the end, that if ſhe have any thing to alledge in her defence, ſhe may: but, if ſhe cannot, and thou not puniſh her, I will ſay, thou art either unjuſt, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puiſſant.</p>
               <p>You may imagine, wiſe Shepheardeſſe, in what a caſe I was in, and how fearfull I was, leſt he ſhould ſay more, and make it known, that it was I of whom he ſpoke. All the Aſſembly turned their eyes towards him, as well, becauſe he ſpoke with a voice full of terrour, as becauſe of his unaccuſtomed way of doing it. But he, after this, ſaid no more, only kneeled down upon his knees, and ſeemed very zealous at his devotion. This moved many unto various cenſures; and it was well for me, that I had a Hood over my face, which kept it from being ſeen; for doubtleſſe, my very bluſhes would have betrayed me, and told all the congregation, that it was I he meant, His friends and kinſmen thought this prayer to be very unſeaſonable, and as ſoon as all divine ſervice was done, they ſought for him, to tell him their opinions; but, they all miſſed of their aimes, for he thruſt himſelfe into the croud, and ſlipt away to his lodging; where, after he had ſet all his buſineſſe in order, he writ a Letter unto me, and put it into his pocket; then writ theſe words unto <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander.</hi>

               <p>He gave command unto a young man, whoſe name was <hi>Halladine,</hi> who ſerved him, and whom he loved very well, both for his affection and ingenuity, that he ſhould bring him a Horſe to the out-ſide of the Town-walls, and another for himſelfe, and this in all haſte, and ſo ſecretly, as none ſhould ſee <hi>Halladine</hi> did as he was commanded. And when they were thus both out of the Town, <hi>Damon</hi> left the high-way, and chuſing out a place fit for his purpoſe, and out of the common paſſage, he acquainted <hi>Halladine</hi> with his intention, gave him his inſtructions and the Letter which he writ unto <hi>Therſander.</hi> The young man, deſirous to ſerve his Maſter according to his commands, found out <hi>Therſander,</hi> and delivered his meſſage ſo handſomely, as none took any notice of it. But, why ſhould I ſpend any more time upon this ſubject? <hi>Therſander</hi> went, they fought, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> was Conquerour, and left <hi>Therſander</hi> bleeding upon the place, with three dangerous wounds in his body: 'Tis true, <hi>Damon</hi> was but in little better condition; but he had ſtrength enough to take the Ring, which <hi>Leriana</hi> gave to <hi>Therſander,</hi> off his finger, whilſt he was in a ſound; and getting upon his horſe, he rid away, commanding <hi>Halladine</hi> to follow him.</p>
               <p>As for my part, I had a great deſire to give this Cavalier all contentment, and looked about for him with as ſearching eyes as any in the company, wondring I could not ſee him. After dinner and not dreaming of this miſchance which hapned, as I and one of my Companions was walking in the Garden, I ſaw <hi>Halladine</hi> comming, who addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe unto me, asked, if <hi>Leriana</hi> was not here lately? And cauſing her to be called, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed himſelfe unto her in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leriana,</hi> My Maſter knowing how welcome the newes I bring would be unto you, hath commanded me to tell it unto you, not for any affection that is betwixt you, but becauſe knowes <hi>Mandonthe</hi> loves you. Then he related the whole paſſage of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, and afterwards continued on: When he was got on Horſeback again, ſaid he, and when I ſaw him ride into places leaſt frequented, I wondred; for he was much wounded, and I could not chuſe but cell him, that I thought it more neceſſary to ſeek out a good Chirurgion, to dreſſe his wounds. He anſwered me, we ſhall finde one preſently <hi>Halla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi> never fear it. I thought he had ſaid true, and believed him, following him ſtill, with abundance of pitty, for he had loſt a great abundance of blood. At laſt, he came to the banks of the River <hi>Garrone,</hi> and to a place where there was ſuch a Precipice, as was a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to look down. Being come unto this place, he would light from his Horſe; but he was ſo weak with the loſſe of ſo much blood, as I muſt needs help him to alight. Then leaning his back againſt the Rock, he pulled a Paper out of his pocket, and holding it in his hand, ſaid unto me: This Letter is directed unto the fair <hi>Mandonthe,</hi> be ſure you give it unto her. Then pulling out the Ring which he took from <hi>Therſander;</hi> Give her this alſo, ſaid he unto me, and aſſure her from me, that death is very welcome to me, ſince I have given a teſtimony, that I did deſerve it better then he unto whom ſhe gave it; and ſince my ſword hath ſent him out of the world, whom ſhe thought ſo worthy of it: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure her by her own merits, and the affection ſhe once vowed unto me, that ſhe never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it hereafter upon one, whoſe Love is diſhonourable to her, and who could no better keep it. I took the Letter and the Ring which he gave me; but ſeeing he had not ſtrength enough to ſuſtain himſelfe, and that he grew very pale, I took him under the arme, bad him be of good heart, and not thus be a murderer of himſelfe: And pulling out my hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefe, I would have ſtopped that wound which bled the moſt But he, taking it haſtily out of my hand: Stay, ſtay, <hi>Hallidane,</hi> ſaid he, never think of living, now I am out of <hi>Mandonthe's</hi> favour. Then holding my handkerchiefe under his wound, be received the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:53526:151"/>
blood as it ran out; and when it was almoſt full, he held it to me, and ſpoke theſe words: Make it appear, <hi>Halladine,</hi> upon this laſt occaſion, that my love to thee, and my choice of thee for thy fidelity, was deſerved: And as ſoon as I am dead, carry this Letter and this Ring unto <hi>Madonthe,</hi> and this handkerchiefe full of blood unto <hi>Leriana,</hi> and tell her, that ſince ſhe could never be ſatisfied with doing me hurt as long as I lived, I have ſent her this blood to ſtop her inſatiable malice. Oh Sir, (ſaid I unto him) ſhall I live to ſee you die for any woman living? Rather command me to ſheath my ſword in their hearts, and to let them know, they are not worthy to uſe ſuch a noble Cavalier in this manner But, ſee the height and ſtrength of his affection! though he was in ſuch a pittifull weak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that he could hardly ſpeak; all he was able to do, was, to lean againſt the Rock: yet, when he heard me utter theſe words, he ſtarted up in fury, took his ſword in his hand, and doubtleſſe had killed me, had I not ſaved my ſelfe by nimbleneſſe. And ſeeing he could not reach me: Away, away, thou wicked and diſloyall Servant, (cryed he out) dareſt thou ſpeak ſo irreverently of the moſt deſerving Woman in the whole Univerſe? If I live, thou ſhalT die by no other hand but mine. Then finding extream feebleneſſe to ſeize upon him, he endeavoured to get near the point of the Rock: You do loſe, this day, Oh faireſt <hi>Madonthe,</hi> (ſaid he) him, whoſe affection is onely worthy of your merits. Then, (Oh heavens!) he leaned over the Rock to throw himſelfe down, and was almoſt quite gone, when I ſuddenly took hold of his Helmet; but, his weight, and the terrour of the Precipice, was more likely to pull me after him, than I to pull him out of it; and, I muſt confeſſe, that fear of death made me let go my hold, to ſave my own life. I ran to the bottom of this Precipice, fetching a great compaſſe round about, in hopes to finde him there ſwimming down the ſtream: But alas! I could never ſee, nor ever finde more, of the body of my poor Maſter. When I had done all I could, and all in vain, I thought it my laſt duty to fulfill his laſt commands, and therefore I came hither. It is to you, Madam, (ſaid he) that this Letter and this Ring is due<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>; and though they be ſprinkled with his blood, yet, be not afraid to take them, for, it is the moſt noble and generous blood that ever came out of a man. And this is thy due (ſaid he to <hi>Leriana,</hi> and gave her his handkerchief full of blood) take it, and glut thy damned rage; and be ſure, that if the gods be juſt, they will ſhoure vengeance upon thee. Upon this word, he threw the handkerchiefe at her ſeet, and beginning to cry, he went away in a ſad and deſperate ſury, and would not give one word more.</p>
               <p>I need not tell you, how this meſſage went to my heart. I cannot, if I would, expreſſe my ſad apprehenſions; I was ſo quite paſt my ſelfe, as they carried me to my Chamber; and, as fortune was, I met thoſe that brought <hi>Therſander,</hi> who was not quite dead. When I was come to my ſelfe again, and my ſpirits a little better ſetled, I caſt my eye upon the Ring which <hi>Halladine</hi> brought me; I took it to be the ſame I did ordinarily wear, and comparing them together, I found no difference, but that it was a little newer and bigger. I could not imagine why they ſhould be made ſo juſt alike, nor who gave it unto <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander.</hi> At laſt, I read the Letter, and found it to be thus written.</p>

               <p>Theſe expreſſions, ſo full of extream tranſport, did make a moſt ſtrange wound in my ſoul; ſuch an odd ſtupification of ſorrow ſeized upon me, as I cannot tell you what I either ſaid or did. So it was, that being got to bed, I loſt my witts, thinking alwaies that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:53526:152"/>
followed me, and the handkerchiefe of blood was ſtill before my eyes; ſo as it was no more then requiſite I ſhould have one alwaies by me, to add ſome conſolation. <hi>Leriana,</hi> who thought that I was ignorant of all her wicked devices, would needs be with me, as uſuall, and the better to diſſemble it, came crying to my bed-ſide: But, as ſoon as ever I ſaw her, I muſt confeſſe, I had not ſo much power over my ſelfe, as to diſſemble my ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of her, and indeed, I thought it in vain, ſince <hi>Damon</hi> was dead: Away, away, moſt wicked and perfidious wretch, (ſaid I unto her) away, thou very Peſt of all human ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, come not near me with thy damned and helliſh tricks, had I as much ſtrength as will, I would ſtrangle thee with my own hands, and tear thy heart in pieces. Thoſe who were in the Chamber, being ignorant of the cauſe I had for theſe expreſſions, were infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely aſtoniſhed at them. But ſhe, who had the readieſt wit in her wickedneſſe, of any that ever breathed, went from me, holding up her hands and eyes, and told them, that, to hee great griefe, I was mad, and quite out of my wits, which they eaſily believed, having heard me utter ſome odd expreſſions; and thus ſhe went out of my Chamber with this excuſe.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, <hi>Therſander</hi> recovered, for his wounds were not mortall, and the loſſe of blood only was the cauſe of his ſounding. Preſently after, I alſo began to be my ſelfe again and to enquire, what reports went of me at Court: I underſtood, that every one talked according to their ſeverall fancies, but that all in generall blamed me for the death of <hi>Damon,</hi> and how every one thought, that <hi>Leriana</hi> had told many a tale unto <hi>Leontidas</hi> and his Wife; and at the ſame time, I ſaw <hi>Therſander</hi> come into my Chamber: The very ſight of him made me ſtart, and having no minde to ſpeak with him, when he fell down upon his knees at my beds ſide, I turned my head the other way. 'Tis very true, Madam, ſaid he) you have no reaſon to look upon a man, who, of all men in the world, is the moſt unworthy of your aſpect; for, I muſt needs confeſſe, I merit that leſſe, then any man that lives, ſince I have given you ſo much cauſe to hate me. But, if your goodneſſe will be pleaſed to daigne me a hearing, perhaps you will not deem me ſo culpable as now you do. And becauſe I anſwered him very ſharply and would not give him leave to ſpeak, my Nurſe, who was with me, took his part, and told me, that I ought to hear him; for, if he were not in fault, I had no reaſon to treat him ſo; and, if he were in fault, then I might, after a hearing, with more reaſon baniſh him my preſence. Well, well, ſaid I, what do you think he will, or can, alledge? I know as well as he, he will ſay, that the affection he bears unto me, hath forced him to do what he did: But, what have I to do with his affection, if it be ſo prejudiciall to me? I ſhall not, Madam, (ſaid he unto me) inſiſt only upon that affection you ſpeak of, though perhaps to any other, that might be a better plea and excuſe, as you think it; but, I ſhall go further, and tell you, that never any were ſo perniciouſly &amp; ſubtlely conſened, as you and I have been by <hi>Leriana.</hi> And hereupon he told the whole ſtory of her jugling artifice, how ſhe infuſed ſo much confidence into him, as to look upon me, to ſpeak unto me, to aſpire unto my favour; how ſhe puffed him up by reports unto him of favours from me, what ſtratagems ſhe invented againſt <hi>Damon,</hi> how ſhe made the world believe he loved <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> how ſhe inſtructed ſilly <hi>Ormanthe</hi> for that purpoſe, and how ſhe gave him a Ring from me, which he conceived to be the cauſe of the quarrell betwixt <hi>Damon</hi> and him. Now Madam, (ſaid he, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued) do you think it poſſible, but that ſuch hopes as ſhe infuſed into me, ſhould ſwell the moſt prudent ſoul that ever was? Alas, I dare not ſo much as wiſh ſo great a happineſs; but me-thinks, I may in reaſon be excuſed, ſince I was meerly drawn in, and poſſed up with vain hopes by the artifice of <hi>Leriana,</hi> with whoſe perſidie I thought fit to acquaint you, that you may hereafter beware of her, and her wicked devices, with which ſhe has cheated both you and me. Then he let me underſtand, how this wicked woman, ſeeing ſhe could no longer deceive me and him, and being alſo reprehended by <hi>Leontidas</hi> and his Wife, for having ſo little care of me; ſhe, to excuſe her ſelfe, had told them all that her ſubtle imagination could deviſe againſt us; how I was in love, and how I was loved by many, and ſo many, as ſhe could hardly number them: and amongſt thoſe whom ſhe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Therſander</hi> were not forgotten. At which, <hi>Leontidas</hi> was ſo angry, and his Wife more, both againſt me and againſt him, as he thought it fit to acquaint me with it, to the end, I might take the beſt courſe I could. And laſtly, he made ſuch humble ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, that I would pardon him, for daring to love me, and ſuch ſerious proteſtations, to live for the future as he ought, that I was conſtrained by the intreaties of my Nurſe, to pardon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:53526:152"/>
But now, wiſe Shepheardeſſes, I ſhall acquaint you with one of the greateſt villanies that ever was invented againſt an innocent perſon. I told you before, how <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> by <hi>Leriana's</hi> command, was extreamly fond of <hi>Damon;</hi> and you muſt know, that ſhe was not ſo ill favoured, nor ſo diſguſted, but her kindneſſes to him were well accepted, ſo as ſhe proved to be with Child. The poor ſilly Wench preſently acquainted her crafty Aunt with it, who at the firſt was much aſtoniſhed and offended at it; but afterwards having recourſe to her accuſtomed ſubtlety, ſhe plotted and intended to make uſe of this occaſion, to make <hi>Damon</hi> believe, that I had this Child by <hi>Therſander;</hi> and therefore ſhe expreſly charged <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> to tell no body of it in the world; and afterwards, becauſe her belly began to ſwell, ſhe taught her how to dreſſe her ſelfe, that it might beſt deceive the worlds notice. But when <hi>Damon</hi> was dead; and that all things were changed, yet ſhe reſolved to purſue her plot, and make uſe of it to my ruine; and thus ſhe went to work. Since this ſad accident of <hi>Damon,</hi> I kept my bed almoſt continually unleſſe in the afternoones I roſe, and ſhut my ſelfe up in my Cloſet, and there ſtayed till nine or ten of the clock at night, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining my own melancholly thoughts alone, and none knew where I was, except my Nurſe and ſome Maides that waited upon me, whom I had charged, to tell none in the world where I was. And becauſe it might be thought ſtrange I never went to the Queen, if it were known I was not ſick, I faigned my ſelfe to be ſo; and to deceive the Phyſicians, I did not complain of a Feavour or any other known diſeaſe, but ſometimes of a Megrim, othertimes of my Teeth, of the Collick, and ſuch like. And becauſe my friends would ſometimes ſend to viſit me, not daring to come themſelves, for fear of offending <hi>Leontidas</hi> and his Wife, who were very potent with the King and Queen, I commanded my Nurſe to put ſome of the Maides into my bed, who ſhould receive the meſſages for me, and who faigning to be unwilling to ſpeak, my Nurſe ſhould make the anſwer; the Windowes being cloſe ſhut and the Curtains drawn, no light almoſt came into the Chamber, ſo as none could tell whether it was I or no. <hi>Leriana</hi> knew by her Niece, that it was my conſtant cuſtome to ſhut my ſelfe up in my Cloſet, every afternoon: And becauſe I was no hater of <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> though ſhe had been ſimply inſtrumentall in my miſery, therefore I permitted her to be alwaies amongſt my Maides: for, what ſhe had done, was not out of any malice unto me: And at this time, ſhe told <hi>Leriana</hi> all paſſages concerning me, more out of ſimplicity, then any hatred unto me. But her Aunt, whoſe aime was abſolutely to ruine me and my reputation, nay, even to take away my life, leſt I ſhould make known all the villany unto <hi>Leontidas,</hi> ſhe thought, that ſhe had met with a fit occaſion to effect her wicked deſires. And becauſe ſhe was ſure, <hi>Therſander</hi> had acquainted me with her arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and tricks, which ſhe had uſed againſt <hi>Damon</hi> and me ſhe turned all her affection to him into mortall hatred. And there being never in this world a ſpirit ſo full of ſubtlety and malice, as this woman, ſhe aimed to be revenged upon <hi>Therſander</hi> and me both at once; and thus ſhe had laid her plot. She asked <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> how long ſhe thought her ſelfe to have been with Child? and upon reckoning up of the time, ſhe found, that ſhe was within a month of her Account; of which <hi>Leriana</hi> was very glad: And after ſhe had bid her be of good courage, ſhe commanded her, to keep her big belly very cloſe, and that as ſoon as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhe found any throwes of Labour to be upon her, then to acquaint her; and in the mean time to get into my bed in my room as oft as ſhe could. And making this to be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of her treaſon, ſhe went unto the Wife of <hi>Leontidas,</hi> and falling down upon her knees, moſt humbly beſeeched her to pardon her careleſſneſſe in obſervance of me. And becauſe ſhe knew, that the aimes of this Lady were more at my Eſtate then me, and ſince there was no likelyhood, that her Nephew would marry me, ſhe added theſe words: If you will be pleaſed, Madam, to take me into your favour again, I ſhall ſhew you a moſt infallible and juſt way to make all <hi>Madonthe's</hi> Eſtate yours. The Lady hearing this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ſo ſuitable to her humour, ſhe began to hearken unto it, and asked her, what way was it that ſhe meant? I ſhall in few words acquaint you, (ſaid this wicked devill) but, Madam, upon condition, that you will pardon a new fault which I ſhall acquaint you withall. And commanding her to ſpeak freely, <hi>Leriana</hi> thus continued: <hi>Madonthe,</hi> (in the perſon of whom, god, Madam, ſeemes to love you, ſince he would not let her be in your houſe) is the moſt miſerable and loſt woman in all <hi>Aquitain;</hi> and I muſt confeſſe, I never thought, that one ſo young as ſhe could have deceived one of my age; her modeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, her high looks her family from whence ſhe is deſcended, and thoſe good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which ſhe had of you, might well move me to anſwer for her chaſtity as for my own; and yet for all this, I have diſcovered, that ſhe is with Child, How! <hi>Madonthe,</hi>
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:53526:153"/>
with Child, ſaid the Lady? Yes, Madam, (anſwered <hi>Leriana)</hi> and more then that, ſhe is ready to be brought to Bed. But how, replyed ſhe, and from whom do you know this? Madam, ſaid ſhe, I moſt humbly beſeech you to pardon me, and to believe that I was not ſo careleſſe in the charge which you gave me, as you imagine: Conſidering her demeanour, I might eaſily be deceived, and could never imagine, ſhe ſhould ever look ſo low, as to love ſuch a man as <hi>Therſander.</hi> I ſee now, that jealouſie has clearer eyes then any pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; for <hi>Damon</hi> found this out, which my eyes could never ſee. At laſt, I came to know it by the means of a Midwife, unto whom ſhe had addreſſed her ſelfe for a Medicine, to make her ſelfe miſcarry: But, the good woman being vertuous, and hating ſuch wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, did anſwer her, That ſhe could not, becauſe now the Child was entirely formed, nay, ready to be born; but, ſhe would do thus much for her, ſhe could make her labour ſo eaſie and ſpeedy, as none ſhould ever know any thing. Now this woman came and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me. And becauſe I was very deſirous to know who the father was, I asked her, if ſhe could ſuſpect any perſon? Very hardly ſaid ſhe unto me, unleſſe it be <hi>Therſander,</hi> for, as oft as I looked upon her belly, or ſhe thought upon the danger ſhe was in ſhe would ſay nothing elſe, but, Ah <hi>Therſander,</hi> thy affection will coſt me dear. This makes me judge it to be him. Now Madam I beſeech you conſider, how could I keep her from this man? a domeſtick, a baſe man, infinitely her inferiour: Could I ever imagine, ſhe ſhould look ſo low as him? But, ſince ſhe hath rendred her ſelfe unworthy of your alliance, let her be puniſhed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her merits, and make her an example unto all of her age, whilſt you do enjoy that Fortune and Eſtate, which ſhe is unworthy of; and this is the way: You know, Madam, that by our Lawes, every woman who offends in Chaſtity, is to die by fire. We ſhall very eaſily convict her of this crime, ſince ſhe hath a witneſſe of it in her own belly. And becauſe thoſe who are thus condemned, do not only loſe their lives, but their Eſtates are alſo conſiſcate to the King, be you the firſt that ſhall beg <hi>Mandonthe's. Leontidas</hi> came into the Room, and finding <hi>Leriana</hi> there: How (ſaid he to his Wife) can you endure the ſight of her, who is the cauſe of our diſpleaſures? His Wife, full of deſire to be Miſtris of my Eſtate, went to him, and took him to the window, there told him how the caſe ſtood: And though he was a perſon of honour, and a generous minded man; yet, ſhe wrought ſo with him, that at the laſt he conſented unto what ſhe deſired: So calling <hi>Leriana,</hi> he commanded her to tell him the truth, and be ſure to ſay no more, then what ſhe could juſtifie. She, with an incredible impudence, repeated all, that before ſhe had told unto his Wife, and farther told him, that if he would not believe her, let him finde out any Midwife, ſo ſhe were one that was unknown to me, and let him receive the truth from her report. <hi>Leontidas</hi> thought this to be a good way &amp; the next morning he ſent for one. It hapned ſo, as that day her Niece, by her command, was in my place in bed; and to keep my Nurſe for taking any notice of what ſhe intended to do, ſhe ſent for her unto her Chamber, under pretence of ſome earneſt buſineſſe with her, ſo as there was none in my Chamber of any judgment; and ſo <hi>Leriana</hi> going in with the Midwife, and having fully inſtructed her Niece what ſhe ſhould ſay, ſhe went unto her, and ſaid: Madam I promiſed to bring one unto you, who would adminiſter ſome comfort unto you; I have now kept my word. <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> in a low voice, anſwered, that ſhe was very welcome. Are you pleaſed, Madam, ſaid the Midwife, that I ſhould ſee in what condition you are in? Yes, ſaid <hi>Ormanthe.</hi> Then ſhe put her hand into the bed, and upon her belly, and did ſuch things as are uſuall upon ſuch occaſions: and as fortune was, the Child ſtirred, ſo as the pains of Labour were preſently upon the poor Wench; and in leſſe then two houres, ſhe was, without any noiſe, or any in the Room that could take any notice, brought to bed.
<hi>Leriana</hi> ſeeing things fall out ſo well according to her deſigne, ſhe ſent the two Maids who were in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber upon two ſeverall errands, and ſo was alone in the Chamber; ſhe cauſed her Niece within an houre after to riſe, and in the mean while, they held the little Child unto the fire. Then to compleat her treaſon, ſhe, with the Midwife, carried it ſtark naked unto <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ontidas,</hi> being very deſirous that every one ſhould ſee it as ſhe went out of my Chamber and Lodgings: I heard it cry into my Cloſet where I was, but never miſtruſting any ſuch villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, I would not be diverted from my ſad thoughts. She addreſſed her ſelf firſt unto the Wife of <hi>Leontidas,</hi> and this teſtimony, together with the Midwife, did give her ſuch aſſurance, as ſhe did believe it, and <hi>Leontidas</hi> alſo. But the better to cover her treaſon, ſhe beſeeched the Lady to content her ſelfe with my Eſtate, and that if ſhe would be pleaſed to ſpare my life, ſhe was confident, conſidering the fault I had committed, that I would be willing to cloiſter up my ſelfe all the reſt of my daies, amongſt the Druides Daughters or Veſtalls:
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:53526:153"/>
and that this would be acceptable unto god, to ſave my life, and not to ſtain ſo noble a Family as mine with an act ſo infamous. That though my fault was great yet ſhe could not forget the affection ſhe once did bear unto me, as long as I did behave my ſelfe as I ought; and therefore ſhe could not chuſe but make this requeſt. The Wife of <hi>Leontidas</hi> having no deſigne upon my life, but only upon my Eſtate, did conſent unto it; but <hi>Leontidas</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, being a man of honour, was long before he could conſent unto it: But at laſt the importunities of his Wife, together with the diſſembling tears of <hi>Leriana,</hi> and the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his obligations unto my Father; all theſe did ſo work with him, as they both commanded <hi>Leriana</hi> to perſwade me, unto what ſhe had propoſed.</p>
               <p>But this not being the deſigne of this devilliſh woman, ſhe deſired them firſt to let ſome daies paſſe, and beſeeched <hi>Leontidas</hi> and his Wife, to let ſome go with her, to ſee in what condition I was: Which they did, commanding an old Lady, and an old Cavalier, in whom they had good aſſurance, to wait upon <hi>Leriana.</hi> She, with the Midwife, after the Child was put to Nurſe, conducted them into my Chamber, went to my bed, and when ſhe found me not in it, ſhe ſeemed amazed; ſhe turned up the clothes, and ſhewed them the ſignes of a Woman in Child-bed; and faigning not to know where I was, did ſeek about for me, and at laſt found me in my Cloſet: She called them unto her, and ſhewed me unto them through the chincks of the dore. All this while I knew nothing, but was then laid down upon a little Couch, with my hand under my head, muſing upon the miſerable fate of <hi>Damon,</hi> ſo as they might eaſily ſee the ſad thoughts of my heart by my face. This wicked wretch made them believe, that my being ill proceeded from my being newly brought to bed, which they, ſeeing my ſad poſture, did very eaſily believe: And being thus deceived, they returned, and made their report unto <hi>Leontidas</hi> and his Wife. In the mean time, <hi>Leriana</hi> ſtaying alone with the Midwife, did change the ſheets of my bed, and all things, that might give any knowledge of what had paſſed. Afterwards conjured the woman not to ſpeak of it, but to obſerve the time and the place very preciſely; and then they went out of my Lodging. My Nurſe preſently after returned, and finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing altered in my Chamber, did wonder at nothing, but not to ſee <hi>Ormanthe</hi> in my bed; but, ſuppoſing ſhe had ſome buſineſſe, ſhe made no great matter of it. Night being come, and the uſuall time of my going to bed, I went into it, and ſlept till the morning, without any manner of imagination of theſe things. In the mean time, <hi>Leriana</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented ſtrange Meſſages and Orations in my name, telling <hi>Leontidas</hi> and his Wife that I did moſt humbly beſeech them to have pitty upon me; that I did acknowledge my life to be in their hands; that I did wholly give my ſelfe unto them, and that I deſired no more, but to be ſhut up in ſome retired place, where none could ſee me; that as ſoon as I was able to ſtir abroad, I would come and beg pardon for the fault which I had committed, and deſire leave to ſequeſter my ſelfe from the world. To be briefe, wiſe Shepheardeſſes, this helliſh woman did ſo well manage her wickedneſſe, that ſix weeks paſſed thus on. In the mean time, <hi>Ormanthe</hi> was ſo well recovered, as if ſhe were a Maid again, and ſo, as none could imagine ſhe had been with Child, but was fairer then before. <hi>Leriana</hi> had ſo well inſtructed her, that when I asked her, why ſhe went away without telling me? ſhe anſwered, That ſhe durſt not knock at my dore for fear of diſturbance, and that when ſhe went, ſhe thought, that ſhe ſhould not have ſtayed away above two or three daies at the moſt, and ſo thought to have returned, before I ſhould take notice ſhe was gone, though her buſineſſe with her Aunt did keep her longer. I received her excuſe, and only told her, that ſhe might well have asked leave.</p>
               <p>Things being in this condition, <hi>Leriana</hi> feared nothing now, but the being convinced of a lie, and therefore reſolved to execute her malicious deſigne. She had two Coſen germans which were Souldiers, and had gotten the reputation of the moſt valiant Blades in all the Court of <hi>Torriſmond;</hi> moreover, they were poor, and had no other hopes, but in being Heires unto <hi>Leriana's</hi> eſtate. She, intending to make uſe of their valour did oblige them both by preſents, and by giving them freſh hopes of her Eſtate; which did tie them ſo unto her, that ſhe could not command any thing which they would not execute. After ſhe had made her ſelfe ſure of them, ſhe began to change her tale with <hi>Leontidas</hi> and his Wife, telling them, that I took courage; that I did not now think any more of leaving the World, but that I had quite forgotten my duty unto them. To be briefe, within a few daies after, ſhe told them, that now there was nothing to be hoped from me, but by force, and that I did deny all; and in ſaying ſo, ſhe ſeemed to be ſo much offended at me, as ſhe confeſſed, I was not worthy of that favour which they would ſhew me. And becauſe the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:53526:154"/>
Wiſe of <hi>Leontidas</hi> gaped ſtill after my Eſtate, ſhe asked her, how ſhe could convince me? We have, ſaid ſhe, very good witneſſes; but, though we had not, yet ſince truth is on our ſide, I have ſome that will maintain it by Armes againſt any whoſoever ſhall maintain the contrary: And you know, Madam, that ſuch things as are dubious, and cannot be made apparent by convincing proofes, the truth of them is to be tryed by Armes. <hi>Leon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidas,</hi> who was a perſon of honour, and who began to be very angry at the craft which he conceived I uſed: No, no, ſaid he, I am very certain ſhe is in a fault; it ſhall be my ſelfe who will accuſe her, and I will maintain it againſt all men whomſoever. <hi>Leriana,</hi> who had made her ſelfe ſure of her two Coſen-germans and who above all deſired to ſeem very affectionate unto <hi>Leontidas,</hi> ſhe turned towards his Wife: Madam, ſaid ſhe unto her, I had rather die, than my Lord ſhould enter into Armes upon this occaſion; I beſeech you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him from it, or elſe I proteſt I will meddle no more in the matter: I have <hi>Leotaris,</hi> my Couſen german, and his Brother, who will undertake the charge; and indeed it is moſt fit they ſhould, for it is not handſome to beg the Eſtate of one, whom he doth accuſe. <hi>Leontidas</hi> perſiſted in his will; but his Wife would by no means ſee him in ſo much danger, and thinking it not handſome he ſhould be my accuſer, and at the ſame time beg my Eſtate of the King, ſhe ſo prevailed with him, that he referred it unto the Kinſmen of this woman. This being the reſolution, <hi>Leriana</hi> ſpake unto <hi>Leotaris,</hi> promiſed him her Eſtate, made an aſſurance of it by Writing; and briefly, ſo obliged him and his Brother, as they would have attempted either againſt heaven or hell; and, right or wrong, would arme themſelves againſt me. <hi>Leriana</hi> being aſſured on this ſide, backed by the opinion of very many, and alſo with the authority of <hi>Leontidas,</hi> ſhe preſented her ſelfe before the King, accuſed me, offered to prove her accuſation, and ſett forth the buſineſſe ſo colourably, as every one believed it to be true: And leſt <hi>Therſander</hi> ſhould diſcover all her wicked devices and forgeries, ſhe made him a party in the accuſation, ſaying, he was the Father of the Child purpoſely to diſable his teſtimony againſt her.</p>
               <p>The Queen, who was a Princeſſe full of honour and vertue, did joyne her prayers with the accuſation of this wicked woman, and did require I ſhould be puniſhed according to the rigour of the Law. <hi>Leontidas</hi> is called, who being aſhamed of the buſineſſe, made the ſame requeſt. This act being to the diſhonour of his family, his wife beſeeched the Queen, to become a mediator for the Eſtate, which the King did freely grant: And yet this good Prince calling to memory, the good ſervice which my Father had don <hi>Thierres</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he was very ſorry for this dyſaſter. The firſt newes I heard of all this, was, when the Officers of Juſtice came to ſeize upon me locked up my Chamber and Cloſet and carried me before the King, never telling me for what. Oh heavens, in what a caſe was I in, when I heard the words of <hi>Leriana?</hi> it was long before I could ſpeak; at laſt, recollecting my ſelfe, I kneeled down before the Queen, beſeeched her not to believe this wicked woman; I proteſted unto her by all that is ſacred, there was no ſuch thing, that there could be no proofe againſt my chaſtity, and beſeeched her out of pitty to favour the cauſe of a moſt innocent. The King was more moved at my words then the Queen; whether it was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he remembered the ſervices of my Father, or becauſe my youth and face moved him to pitty; but ſo it was, that turning towards <hi>Leriana:</hi> If you do aver (ſaid he) any thing which is not true, I do vow by the ſoul of my Father, that you ſhall ſuffer the ſame pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which you have prepard for others. Sir, (ſaid ſhe, with an impudent brow) I will prove what I ſay, both by Witneſſes and by Armes. And both, ſaid the King, are allowed you. Then cauſing us to be ſeparated, I was committed to ſafeguard, and <hi>Therſander</hi> alſo; and it was commanded that witneſſes ſhould be produced: Then the Midwife and the Nurſe of <hi>Ormanthe's</hi> Child, did teſtifie their knowledge in the buſineſſe; the old Cavalier and the old Matron of whom I ſpoke, did the like; ſhe produced ſeverall witneſſes, who ſaw her go out of my Chamber with the Child. To be briefe, the proofes were ſuch, as if god had not preſerved my innocency, I had been condemned. By fortune, the Judges being in my Chamber, and reading the Depoſitions againſt me, I knew not what to do in this affliction but only to have recourſe unto the gods; and then, lifting up my hands and eyes to heaven, I prayed; Oh! ye moſt omnipotent gods who do ſee into my heart, and know, that I am innocent of all this which I am accuſed of, be my ſupporters, and declare my innocency. And then, as if inſpired by ſome good angell, I turned my ſelfe towards the chimney, and addreſſing my ſpeech unto the Judges: If theſe accuſations (ſaid I unto them) be true. I beſeech the gods that I may never breathe again; and if they be falſ, I beſeech them, that this hot coal may not burn me: Then preſently ſtooping, I took up a
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:53526:154"/>
great coal of fire, and held it in my hand naked, till it was extinguiſhed, not being at all burned. The Judges amazed at this proof, would needs touch the coal, to try whether it was cold, but they quickly withdrew their hand; then they looked into my hand, to ſee if there was any ſigne of burning, but they found it no more touched, then if it had never touched fire; you may imagine whether they were aſtoniſhed or no: But ſo it was, they made a report of this unto the King, who ordained, that <hi>Leriana</hi> ſhould be acquainted with it, to ſee, if this teſtimony of my innocence, would make her decline her accuſation: But ſhe alledged, that I had procured ſome receipt, which kept the fire from burning me, and that her Witneſſes which ſhe produced were without exception, and that this proofe by fire might perhaps have been allowed, if it had been ordained and appointed by the Judges; but, ſince it proceeded from my own will, it was to be ſuſpected of much artifice. To be briefe, ſage Shepheardeſſes, ſhe ſmoothed over her villany with ſo many colourable arguments of truth, as all the favour I could obtain from the King, was, to ordain, that the matter ſhould be tryed by Armes, and that within fifteen daies, we ſhould finde out the Cavaliers, which ſhould enter into the liſts for us.</p>
               <p>The newes of all this was quickly diſperſed throughout all <hi>Aquitain,</hi> ſo as my Mother heard of it as well as others; and becauſe <hi>Leriana</hi> had produced ſo many Witneſſes, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, as almoſt all others did, that I had committed the fault whereof I was accuſed; and ſhe having lived alwaies in great honour and ſame, it grieved her ſo much, as ſhe fell ſick, and being old withall, ſhe died within ten or twelve daies after ſhe firſt heard of it; but, in ſuch a bad opinion of me, as ſhe would never ſend to ſee me nor aſſiſt me in my juſtification. And ſee how many ſeverall waies the gods were pleaſed to afflict me; for, this grieved me more, then I am able to expreſſe. Thus was I without Father or Mother, deſtitute of all friends, and univerſally blamed by every one. I muſt confeſſe, I did many times intend to throw my ſelfe out of the window, to rid my ſelfe out of ſo many ſorrowes; but, ſtill the gods preſerved me in hopes that my innocency would at laſt appear, putting into my minde, that if I ſhould die ſo, I ſhould leave all <hi>Aquitain</hi> in a bad opinion of me. But, when <hi>Leriana</hi> offered <hi>Leotaris</hi> and his Brother for her Champions, and when neither <hi>Therſander</hi> nor I could name any, as well, becauſe we were not prepared for it, as, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man would enter into ſo bad a quarrell, as every one thought this was: I muſt confeſſe I was aſtoniſhed, and now more then ever grieved for poor <hi>Damon,</hi> aſſuring my ſelfe, that had he been alive, I could not have wanted a Champion. <hi>Therſander,</hi> on the other ſide, he muſt defend his cauſe by fighting, both with <hi>Leotaris</hi> and his Brother, one after another. But the terme being paſt, the King in favour allowed us eight daies longer, and they being paſt, he added three more: without any further delay, at the expiration of which, we were brought into the Liſts, I all in mourning, and without any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, but the Officers of juſtice; and <hi>Leriana,</hi> on the contrary, all triumphant, and in the company of many Gallants; ſhe was upon another Scaffold, oppoſite to that where I was. <hi>Leotaris</hi> and his Brother were already in the Liſts, armed <hi>Cap apé,</hi> and bravely mounted vaunting the more, becauſe they believed to finde no Antagoniſt but <hi>Therſander,</hi> for none elſe could we finde, becauſe <hi>Leontidas,</hi> who was the Kings favourit, did take <hi>Leriana's</hi> part; and thoſe who heretofore had made addreſſes of Love unto me, and would have undertaken a hundred ſuch Combats for me, were now all cold and backward, becauſe I had ſleighted them for <hi>Therſander.</hi> Thus you may ſee, a falſhood is hardly to be known from truth, when it is ſubtlely diſguiſed with a handſome gloſſe. At laſt, <hi>Therſander</hi> enters the Liſts againſt them both, hoping, that the juſtice of his cauſe would bear him out. It was ordained by the Judges, that if during the Combat, any Cavalier would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him ſelfe for me, he ſhould be received; and that <hi>Leotaris</hi> and his Brother, might fight with <hi>Therſander,</hi> both together, or ſeverally, if they would. Theſe two Brothers were men of great courage, and perſons of honour, ſo as they would undertake him one after another; but <hi>Leriana</hi> would not by any means ſuffer it, ſo as they ran both of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againſt him. Judge, ſage Shepheardeſſes, in what a condition I was; I do aſſure you, that I was ſo much out of my ſelfe, as I could not ſee any thing. I looked at. At laſt, the command was given, and the Trumpets ſounded. <hi>Therſander,</hi> who was couragious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, putting his confidence in the gods, and juſtice of his cauſe, ſet ſpurrs to his Horſe, and with his Lance, hit the Brother of <hi>Leotaris,</hi> and doing him no hurt, brake it; but he himſelfe at the ſame time, was diſmounted by two Lances, with the ſadle betwixt his legs. <hi>Leriana</hi> ſeeing ſo great an advantage on her ſide, ſhe was all joy; I, on the contrary, all fear. <hi>Therſander</hi> ſeeing himſelfe in this extremity, did not for all that loſe his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:53526:155"/>
but running to his Horſe, he pulled the bridle off from his head, before his Antagoniſts could return upon him: The Horſe being of a high ſpirit, and finding himſelfe without either bridle or ſadle, began to run up and down the place, and, as if the gods had inſpired him, came to <hi>Leotaris</hi> and his Brother, and began to paw with his feet, and bite with his teeth, kicking and bounding, and did ſo fiercely aſſault them that they, in lieu of fighting with <hi>Therſander,</hi> had enough to do to defend themſelves from this Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal: This did amuſe them a while, becauſe they could not kill him ſo ſoon as they did imagine becauſe of his nimblence and perpetuall motion; but at the laſt, they diſpatched him, and being animated the more againſt <hi>Therſander,</hi> reſolved to diſpatch him alſo preſently; and therefore falling both upon him in the heat of their fury, he had no other way but to run cloſe to his dead Horſe, which lay gaſping in the end of the Liſts, and which did him ſome ſervice after his death; for the Horſes of his enemies did boggle ſo at him, that their Riders could hardly come neer him, and this prolonged the Combat: At the laſt, <hi>Leotaris</hi> ſeeing he could not get his Horſe any neerer he alighted from him, and ſo did his Brother from his; and leaving their Horſes both looſe in the place, went both up to <hi>Therſander,</hi> and fell upon him, who certainly did as much as one man could well do, but having to deal with two of the ſtouteſt Cavaliers in all <hi>Aquitain,</hi> at once, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to make any long reſiſtance. He had received ſeverall wounds, and loſt ſo much blood, as he had not ſtrength to defend himſelfe any longer, when the gods, out of pitty unto me, did ſend a Cavalier, who deſired entrance into the Liſts, in defence of me and <hi>Therſander:</hi> The dore was preſently opened unto him; and becauſe he ſaw <hi>Therſander</hi> in great extremity, he ſpurred his Horſe furiouſly up unto them; but when he was come neer, he ſtooped, and cryed out unto them; Hold Cavaliers, and do not any longer offend againſt the Lawes of Chivalrie; come off that wounded man, and fall both upon me, who am ſent hither purpoſely to puniſh you. <hi>Leotaris</hi> and his Brother hearing his voice, did recoile, and were ſorry that they were both on foot, and therefore ran towards their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: But the ſtranger rid up to them, and told them, That if they had their Horſes, they ſhould receive it as a courteſy from him, and not from their own nimbleneſſe. But get up, ſaid he, I ſcorn to take the advantage of my Horſe againſt you. They both did infinitely eſteem this generous act of this ſtranger; but I was very ſorry for it, conceiving, that he might very well have taken all advantages againſt thoſe, who had fallen both at once upon <hi>Therſander.</hi> But this ſtranger had more noble thoughts, and would not let that which was blamable in others, be any example unto himſelf. Whilſt I was in theſe thoughts, <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taris</hi> and his Brother had both mounted themſelves, who never conſidering the courteſie they had received, fell both at once upon him; but they found a ſtronger arme to deal with, then <hi>Therſanders.</hi> I cannot, ſage Shepheardeſſes, particularize this Combat unto you, for my fears were ſuch, as I hardly ſaw it; let it ſuffice I tell you, that this ſtranger ſhewed ſuch wonderfull ſtrength and valour, that <hi>Leriana</hi> thought him a devill, and not a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man. After they had fought a while, I perceived, that though he was ſingle, yet he had the advantage of them. As for <hi>Therſander,</hi> he was ſo weak, as he was not able to riſe. But this ſtranger, to the wonder of all the ſpectators, did give the Brother of <hi>Leotaris</hi> ſuch a fatall blow, that he ſtruck his head from his ſhoulders. <hi>Leotaris</hi> ſeeing this, his fury ſwelled with revenge: But the ſtranger, having now to do with no more but him, did wound him in ſo many places, that he was ſo weak with the loſſe of blood, as he fell from his Horſe to the ground, and falling with his head foremoſt, the weight of his body and his armes broke his neck. The ſtranger alighting from his horſe, and ſeeing him dead, he went unto <hi>Therſander,</hi> helped him to riſe, and ſet him upon one of the Horſes of his enemies; and then taking his own, he addreſſed himſelfe unto the Judges, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them, if he had any more to do? And they anſwering, No: Then he required that I ſhould be ſet at liberty, which was commanded that very minute. Then he came unto me, and asked me, if he could do me any further ſervice? Yes, Sir, ſaid I unto him, in two things; the one, to conduct me home, and reſcue me from the tyranny of thoſe, who have raviſhed me from my deareſt Mother; and the other is, that I may know the name of him, unto whom I owe both my life and my honour. As for my name (anſwered he) I ſhall take it as a favour, if you will not force me to make it known; And as for waiting upon you, unto the place where you deſire to be, I ſhall do it, ſo it may be preſently.</p>
               <p>Whilſt things went thus on my ſide in this place, the gods did evidence, that they never forſake the innocent; for it hapned, that my poor Nurſe, having not ſo much courage as to ſee me die, and thinking it impoſſible, that <hi>Therſander</hi> could maintain it out againſt two
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:53526:155"/>
ſuch Cavaliers, ſhe ſtayed in my Chamber, crying and making moſt lamentable moan. <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> who had received all the courteſies ſhe could deſire, both from her and me, was exceedingly moved at it, and being very ſimple without any ſubtlety, ſhe could not chuſe but tell her, how her Aunt alwaies aſſured her, that I ſhould not die, but only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, that I ſhould be beholding unto her for my life, to the end, I ſhould be a better friend unto her. Ah! ſweetheart, ſaid the Nurſe, it is moſt certain our Miſtreſſe muſt die, if <hi>Therſander</hi> be overcome, the King himſelfe, according to the Lawes, cannot ſave her. Alas, alas, ſaid <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> ſhall my Lady be burned? Nay, nay, ſaid my Nurſe, it is too ſure. Ah me! moſt miſerable wretch that I am, replyed the Wench, how can I ever expect that the gods will pardon me for her death? Why, ſaid my Nurſe, are you any waies guilty of her death? Oh Mother! ſaid <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> if you will promiſe me to tell no body, I will tell you a ſtrange accident. And my Nurſe promiſing ſecreſie, ſhe told her, that it was ſhe who had the Child, and told her all that I have related unto you. Sweetheart, ſweetheart, ſaid my Nurſe preſently, let us go preſently and ſave her life; believe it, the gods will be well pleaſed with it; and moreover I will undertake, you ſhall have what you will of my Lady. Thus was the truth diſcovered.</p>
               <p>The Wench followed my Nurſe, who, to be briefe, addreſſed herſelfe to the Queen, and acquainted her with the whole buſineſſe, whilſt the ſtranger was talking unto me.</p>
               <p>The wickedneſſe of <hi>Leriana</hi> being thus diſcovered, both by Armes, and the confeſſion of this Wench, the King commanded, ſhe ſhould be burned in the ſame fire that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for me; though ſhe did inveigh againſt her Niece, ſaying, That my Nurſe had ſuborned her, and that ſhe was not of age to be a competent Witneſſe, eſpecially againſt her above all others, becauſe ſhe had chid and chaſtized her for theſe vices. But all theſe alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations were invalid, the truth was evident enough, by the particulars and circumſtances which this Wench did ſpeak of, and by the report of the Midwife, who confeſſed, that ſhe never ſaw her face. Every one began to clap their hands and the people ſeeing the villany of <hi>Leriana,</hi> began to throw ſtones at her. The King commanded juſtice ſhould be executed, and ſhe ſeeing her ſelfe ready to be throwne into the fire, being much moved at the memory of all her wickedneſſe, ſhe confeſſed the truth; ſhe deſired audience, declared all her wicked practices, asked me pardon, and then voluntarily threw her ſelfe into the fire, where ſhe ended her daies, to the contentment of all thoſe, who heard of her wicked and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious waies.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe things were thus in agitation, the Cavalier who had delivered me, deſiring not to be known (as it is thought) retired himſelfe, and none took notice which way; and I not finding him, was extreamly grieved, he ſhould depart with ſo few thanks for what he had done: I uſed all the means I poſſibly could to hear of him; but after all enquiry, all I could hear, was the next morning from a Country man, who met him, and whom he deſired to come unto me from him, and let me know, that had he not been urged by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream importancy, he would have ſtayed longer, and waited upon me whither I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him; but he had promiſed ſome aſſiſtance to a Lady, who lived towards the Town of <hi>Gergovia;</hi> and that if I had any more ſervice to command him, I might hear of him at the Golden Mount; and that he might be known, he would not change the Device which was upon his Shield. Then asking the man, what it was, becauſe I was ſo aſtoniſhed the day before, that I took no notice of it? He told me, that it was a Tiger feeding upon the Heart of an Human body, with this Motto, <hi>Thou giveſt me a Death, and I maintain thy Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, diſcreet Shepheardeſſes, to abridge my ſtory, it was ordered, that I ſhould be free from the Guardianſhip of <hi>Leontidas,</hi> becauſe his Wife had begged my Eſtate, and be ſet clearly at liberty. The poor ſilly <hi>Ormanthe,</hi> ſince ſhe was only ſeduced by the ſubtlety of her Aunt, ſhe was ſhut up in one of thoſe houſes deſigned for ſuch puniſhments, where the women there do live very well, only they muſt never come out. I ſhall now make a ſtrange relation unto you: I did ſtill love <hi>Damon</hi> moſt extreamly, and the memory of him ſince his death was ſo imprinted in my ſoul, that he was commonly alwaies before my eyes: But ſince this accident, and ſince I ſaw this ſtrange Cavalier, I know not how, but I began to change my firſt affection, and placed it upon him; and though I never ſaw his face, yet, I muſt confeſſe, I love him, ſo as it may be ſaid, I was in love with a face of Armour: I know not whether my obligation to him was the cauſe of it, or whether his valour and courage, and noble minde, forced me unto it; but ſo it is, I never loved any ſince that day, but this unknown Cavalier; and in teſtimony of it, after a long expectance
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:53526:156"/>
of his return, and hearing no newes of him, I reſolved to go my ſelfe unto <hi>Gergovea,</hi> and the Golden Mount: After I had conſulted with my ſelfe about this deſigne, I acquainted <hi>Therſander</hi> with it, who offered me all his aſſiſtance; and I addreſſed my ſelfe unto him, rather then unto any other, becauſe ſince the day he fought for me, he had wholly dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated himſelfe unto my ſervice; and becauſe I had often heard him ſay, that he was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely deſirous to know that valiant Cavalier, who had ſo bravely relieved us. I gave out therefore, that I would go and viſit my Eſtate; I prepared my Train, I left the Court, and came to my own houſe, where leaving all my retinue, I took with me only my Nurſe for a companion, and <hi>Therſander</hi> to defend me, and ſo ſetforwards towards the Golden Mount. The Country was extreamly rough and mountainous, almoſt never without ſnow and ice; my poor Nurſe dyed there, and having interred her, I was much grieved to be alone with <hi>Therſander;</hi> but I preſently met with <hi>Tircis, Hylas,</hi> and <hi>Laonice,</hi> whoſe company pleaſed me ſo much, that, not to loſe it, I reſolved to put on the habit of a Shepheardeſſe, as now you ſee me, and <hi>Therſander</hi> in the habit of a Shepheard. Then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we had ſtayed a while amongſt the Mountains, in hopes to hear ſome newes of him I was in queſt of, I reſolved to come into this Country, ſince he appointed us to make that way, thinking, that when I came to <hi>Gergovea,</hi> I ſhould haply finde this Cavalier, unto whom I was ſo much obliged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madonthe</hi> was thus telling her ſtory, and not without bedewing her cheeks with tears, whilſt <hi>Paris</hi> and the reſt of the ſhepheards were talking together; for their mindes were poſſeſſed with that malady, which above all others is an enemy to ſleep. For <hi>Tircis,</hi> he loved his deceaſed <hi>Cleon,</hi> although he was out of all hopes of ever ſeeing her again. And becauſe there was none of them ſo free as the inconſtant <hi>Hylas,</hi> he bore it out the beſt of any in the company, and was leaſt troubled with his Love. <hi>Tircis,</hi> thinking upon his dear <hi>Cleon,</hi> he could not chuſe but ſigh very loud, and <hi>Silvander</hi> at the ſame time did the ſame. See, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> what difference there is betwixt theſe two ſighes. What is the difference, ſaid <hi>Paris?</hi> The difference is, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> that <hi>Silvander</hi> doth ſigh ſo, to cool the fire which ſcorcheth him; and <hi>Tircis</hi> ſighes and blowes, to kindle that fire which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore did ſcorch him. <hi>Hylas</hi> had ſaid very well, ſaid <hi>Tircis,</hi> if he had ſaid, he had thought ſo; for this is only a meer imagination of a ſoul that knowes not how to love. How now, <hi>Tircis,</hi> ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> do you alſo upbraid me, that I know not how to love? I thought there had been none but that fantaſticall <hi>Silvander,</hi> who had been of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. If you would judge according to reaſon, ſaid <hi>Tircis,</hi> you would be of our opinions. Why, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> is it requiſite, that to love well, I muſt needs Idolize one that's dead, as you do? Did you but know how to love, aright, (ſaid <hi>Tircis)</hi> queſtionleſſe, if you ſhould meet with ſo great a misfortune as mine, you would think your ſelfe obliged in duty ſo to do. How, how, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> in love with a Grave, a Coffin? believe it, ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, I will never be in love with any ſuch Miſtreſſes: But, come a little to reaſon, what contentment, and what end do you aime at in ſuch a love? Love, ſaid <hi>Tircis,</hi> is a great god, which can aime at or deſire nothing but himſelf; he is his own Center, and has no aime or inclination, but what begins and ends in himſelfe: Love is like a Ring, it begins where it ends, and ends where it begins; it is perpetuall, it aimes at no ends, but is pleaſed and contented with its own nature. Theſe are delicate dreames indeed, ſaid <hi>Hylas;</hi> for my part, I believe them to be all fables, invented by ſome ſilly women. What is it, <hi>Hylas,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Tircis)</hi> which you think ſo far from truth? All that you ſay, anſwered <hi>Hylas,</hi> is ſo palpably groſſe, as I were mad if I did not ſee the ſimplicity of them.</p>
               <p>You ſay, Love deſires nothing but it ſelfe, and I ſay, we ſee the contrary; for we never deſire any thing, but that which we have not. If you did underſtand, anſwered <hi>Tircis,</hi> how by the infinite power of Love, two perſons becomes but one, you would know, that a Lover can deſire nothing but himſelfe; for as ſoon as you do underſtand, how a Lover is transformed into the perſon Loved, and the perſon Loved into the Lover, and both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes but one, though being Lover and Loved they are two, you would finde, <hi>Hylas,</hi> and confeſſe, that ſince the Lover deſires nothing but the perſon Loved, and ſince he is himſelfe both the Lover and the Loved by this conjunction, he can deſire nothing but himſelfe. See, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> how the old Proverb is truly verified, one Errour begets a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. You would perſwade me into a beliefe of things impoſſible, as, that the Lover be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the perſon Loved: why, by this argument, I am <hi>Phillis,</hi> for I do love her, and yet I am <hi>Hylas,</hi> and I do deſire her. The concluſion, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> is not good, for you do not love her: Had you ſaid, that I, in loving <hi>Diana,</hi> were transformed into her, you had
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:53526:156"/>
ſaid right. Well, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> are you then <hi>Diana?</hi> is your Cap there changed into a Coyfe, and your Coat into a Gown? My Cap, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> does not love her Coife. Very good (ſaid the inconſtant <hi>Hylas)</hi> if you be changed into <hi>Diana,</hi> you ſhould then dreſſe your ſelfe in the habit of a woman: It is not handſome, that ſo wiſe a ſhepheardeſſe as you are, ſhould diſguiſe your ſelfe thus in the habit of a man. There was none in all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany could forbear laughing at the pleaſant expreſſions of this merry ſhepheard; <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> himſelfe could not hold: But afterwards, he anſwered him thus: I will, if I can, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of your errour: Know therefore, that there are two parts in a man, the one is the Body, which we ſee and touch, and the other is the ſoul, which we cannot ſee nor touch, but is known by words and actions; for neither words nor actions are parts of the Body, but of the Soul, which makes uſe of the Body only as an inſtrument and organ; for the body does not ſee of it ſelfe, nor underſtand, it is the Soul which does it; and ſo by conſequence, when we do love, it is not the Body which loves, but the Soul; and ſo it is only the Soul which transformes it ſelfe into the perſon Loved, and not the Body. But, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> I do love the Body as well as the Soul; and ſo, if a Lover be changed into the thing Loved, my Soul ſhould be changed as well into the Body of <hi>Phillis,</hi> as into her Soul This ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> does thwart the Lawes of Nature; for a Soul, which is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, cannot become a Body, no more then a Body can become a Soul. If it be ſo, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> that the change be but in part, and that part be the Soul, it is that part which I do leaſt care for. In this, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> you do make it evidently appear, that you do not love; or at leaſt, that you do love againſt reaſon: For the Soul ought not to debaſe it ſelfe, unto that which is interiour unto it ſelfe; and therefore they ſay, that Love ought to be betwixt equalls; that is a Soul to love a Soul, which is its equall, and not the Body which is its inferiour, and which Nature gave him only as an inſtrument. Now to make it appear, that the Lover becomes the party Loved, and that if you do love <hi>Phillis, Hylas</hi> is <hi>Phillis;</hi> and if <hi>Phillis</hi> love <hi>Hylas, Phillis</hi> is <hi>Hylas,</hi> conſider what the Soul is; It does conſiſt, Shepheard, of the Will, the Memory, and of the Underſtanding: Now Philoſophers do hold, that we can love only that, which we do know; and if the knowledge, and the thing known, be one and the ſame thing, it muſt conſequently follow, that the knowledge of him who Loves, and her who is loved, is the ſame. That if the Will of a Lover, ought not to differ from the Will of the perſon Loved, and if he do ſeek her by his thoughts, which is onely an effect of the Memory, as well as by his corporeall eyes, who can doubt, but that the Memory, the Underſtanding and the Will, being changed into the perſon loved, his Soul, which conſiſts of theſe three faculties, is changed alſo. By <hi>Tautates</hi> (ſaid <hi>Hylas)</hi> you fetch it very high; and though I have been long a Student in the <hi>Maſſilian</hi> Schooles, yet I cannot reach you. It was there, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> where I learned this Philoſophy. Though you have puzzled my brains with your diſcourſe, ſaid <hi>Hylas,,</hi> yet you cannot demonſtrate unto me, that a Lover is changed into the Loved, ſince there is one part left out, which is the Body. The Body, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> is not a part, but only an organ or inſtrument of the Soul; and if the Soul of <hi>Phillis</hi> were ſeparated from her Body, would it not be ſaid, there is the Body of <hi>Phillis,</hi> and not <hi>Phillis</hi> her ſelfe? And if that be properly ſpoken, then it muſt be underſtood that <hi>Phillis</hi> is ſomewhere elſe; and if you do love aright, it is into that <hi>Phillis</hi> into which you ſhould be transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; ſo as if this be ſo, you can have no deſire out of your ſelfe: for, compriſing all your love in your ſelfe, you do alſo comprize all your deſires within your ſelfe. If it be ſo, (ſaid <hi>Hylas)</hi> that the Body is but the inſtrument, which <hi>Phillis</hi> maketh uſe of, I will give you that <hi>Phillis,</hi> and let me have the reſt, and ſee whether you or I ſhall be better contented. But to end all our differences, it were good if we could get a little ſleep. Upon this, he was ſilent, and would not give any further anſwer: Alſo all the Company by little and little fell aſleep, except <hi>Silvander,</hi> whoſe ſoul being ſwelled with abundance of reall affection, he could not cloſe his eye of a long time after.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Madonthe,</hi> as I told you before, had related the ſtory of her fortune unto theſe fair ſhepheardeſſes; and becauſe a great part of the night was already ſpent, ſleep did by degrees ſteal into the eyes of <hi>Phillis,</hi> and her: But <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> who could not ſleep, ſtill talked with <hi>Diana,</hi> who for her part, ſeeing how extreamly <hi>Silvander</hi> loved her, ſhe began alſo to love him, although her affection to him did inſenſibly begin, ſhe not taking any notice of it: At the firſt, it was no more, then a meer acknowledgment of his merit, (ſo requiſite is Knowledge before Love) and afterwards, ordinary converſation with him, did win her to a liking of his company; at laſt, his addreſſes unto her, with ſo
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:53526:157"/>
much reverence and diſcretion, made her love him; yet without any deſigne or intention ſo to do. <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> who entertained the ſame thoughts of <hi>Celadon,</hi> not being in diſpoſe to ſleep, and ſeeing <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Madouthe</hi> both faſt, alſo thinking that none could hear her, ſhe ſpoke thus unto <hi>Diana:</hi> Siſter, I muſt confeſſe, that one imprudent act doth draw ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſorrowes after it, and when one fault is once committed, it requires abundance of wiſdome to repair it. Conſider, I beſeech you, how this crime which I committed againſt the affection of <hi>Celadon,</hi> hath hurried me into a ſea of ſorrowes; I do verily believe, that as long as I live, nay, and after my death too, if the dead have any knowledge of paſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as I believe they have, I ſhall never ceaſe my grief, for my offending againſt the fidelity of <hi>Celadon;</hi> yet, you ſee unto what a paſſe this fault hath brought me: This love, which with ſo much paines and care I have ſo long kept ſecret, and would hardly acquaint my deareſt companions with it; ſee, I ſay, how I do at this houre my ſelfe diſcover it unto ſtrangers, who are not any waies in the world obliged unto me. Ah! could I recall that happineſſe which I have loſt, me-thinks I could manage it with more prudence. Siſter, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> all human imbecillity hath this property, that the malady can very hardly be known untill it be preſent; the gods themſelves only will be eſteemed perfect and wiſe: And you muſt think, that if the loſſe of <hi>Celadon</hi> which you cauſed, had not fallen out that way, doubtleſſe it had ſome other; for, there is nothing firme and truly ſolid amongſt men. I cannot ſay, but perfect prudence may a litle foreſee, and mitigate theſe accidents; but believe me, Siſter, we muſt know withall, that we are all but human, and full of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections. You ſee, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> how ſome do paſſe their lives: more ſweetly than others, or at the leaſt, their actions are not ſeen or known unto the world; and I need not go any further for an inſtance, then in your misfortune in <hi>Philander;</hi> but who can blame you for it? Ah Siſter! ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> there is no ſharper reproofes of our faults, then the knowledge that we our ſelves have of them. It is very true, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> but you muſt needs confeſſe, that as any good which we do enjoy; is better and greater for being known; ſo alſo the ſorrowes and pains, when they are known, are far more bitter and ſmarting: And hence it is, that every one ſtrives to hide and conceal the afflictions which befall them, and oftentimes had rather they were greater and ſecret, then leſſe and publick. Now, Siſter, there is one thing, which my affection to you prompts me to advertiſe you of, unto which me thinks your prudence ought to apply ſome remedies; and I am ſure, if before my misfortune did befall me, I had met with a friend who had freely ſpoken unto me, I ſhould not have been ſo ſadly aſhamed as I am. Siſter, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> this is a great argument of your good affection to me; and you will infinitely oblige me, if not only now, but alwaies, you will tell me your opinion of all my actions, freely, and clearly, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially now, when all are aſleep.</p>
               <p>Although theſe two Shepheardeſſes did think, that none did hear them, yet they were deceived; for <hi>Laonice,</hi> who was in the company, although ſhe ſeemed to be aſleep, yet ſhe was awake; and being extreamly deſirous to hear more, that ſhe might, according to her deſigne do them a diſpleaſure, ſhe liſtened with a moſt attentive ear. On the other ſide, <hi>Silvander</hi> ſeeing all his company aſleep, and hearing the ſheph eardeſſes talking, he thought that he heard the voice of <hi>Diana;</hi> and having an itching deſire to hear their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, he ſtole ſo gently neer them upon his hands and knees, as he could hear them very diſtinctly; and by fortune, he came juſt as <hi>Aſtrea</hi> did begin to ſay thus.</p>
               <p>Do you remember what I ſaid unto you yeſterday in you ear, when <hi>Silvander</hi> diſputed with <hi>Phillis?</hi> Was it not (ſaid <hi>Diana)</hi> concerning the affection of that ſhepheard towards me? The very ſame, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> and be pleaſed to underſtand, that ſince, I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it more plainly by the diſcourſe which I have had with him, and you may moſt infallibly expect a moſt extream and violent affection from him: If this affection be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing unto you, it is requiſite you keep him at a diſtance from you, though I cannot tell whether that will do any good, ſince his humour is of ſuch a nature, as the more it is croſſed, the more violent it will grow; but if it be pleaſing unto you, it is moſt requiſite you uſe abundance of diſcretion, that it may not be known unto any but your ſelfe. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, (ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> after ſhe had a while conſidered upon it) I ſee you make your love unto me moſt evidently appear, and will keep any thing ſecret which I ſhall ſay; I will therefore open my very heart unto you, but with a hearty deſire, that what e're I ſhall ſay may go no further, no, not to <hi>Phillis</hi> her ſelfe, if it be no offence to the friendſhip that is betwixt you. I ſhould think, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> my ſelfe unworthy of your love, if I ſhould impart any ſecret which you ſhall truſt me withall, unto any other; nay, I ſhould think my ſelfe
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:53526:157"/>
to be a moſt horrid Traitor: And as for <hi>Phillis,</hi> be confident, Siſter, that as I would not do any act which might wound that affection I bear unto her, ſo ſhe ſhall never make me offend againſt the love I have vowed unto you. Not that I have any diffidence in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of <hi>Phillis,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Diana)</hi> but becauſe I would, if I could, hide it from my own ſelfe. Upon this, ſhe pauſed a while, and then continued: When I loſt <hi>Philander,</hi> (as, Siſter, I have told you) I was ſo exceedingly grieved at it, that for a long time after, I reſolved never to love any again, but to ſpend all the reſt of my mourning daies in an eternall wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood: For, though <hi>Philander</hi> was not my Husband, yet I do verily believe he had been, if he had ſurvived <hi>Philidas.</hi> In this reſolution, I may moſt ſafely and truely proteſt unto you, I have lived hitherto, ſo inſenſible of any love, as if I had neither any eyes or ears, to ſee or hear any motion that was preſented unto me in that kinde; <hi>Amidor,</hi> kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man unto <hi>Philidas,</hi> can teſtifie as much, who, though of a wavering humour, had parts ſufficient to make himſelfe loved, and who before he married <hi>Alf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>runte,</hi> did often offer to take me upon what conditions ſoever I ſhould require: Witneſſe alſo the poor <hi>Nican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> I call him poor, becauſe of the ſtrange courſe which he took after my refuſall. To be briefe, witneſſe all thoſe, who ſince that day have made addreſſes of love unto me. The memory of <hi>Philander</hi> has unto this very day ſo defended me againſt all others, as I have not had ſo much as any thought of love. But I muſt needs confeſſe, that ſince the faigned addreſſe of <hi>Silvander,</hi> I perceived my ſelfe much changed: I know, this ſhepheard at the firſt, did only court me for a wager; and yet as ſoon as he began, his addreſſes did pleaſe me. On the contrary, the generous <hi>Paris</hi> did very really love me, and quitted the grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of his quality for my ſake and yet for all his merits, I could finde in my ſelfe no other love unto him, then that of a Siſter unto a Brother. To finde out the reaſon of all this, is a thing impoſſible, but yet it is moſt certainly true. Now, Siſter, if I do ſay, that I do love <hi>Silvander</hi> after another manner, miſtake me not; do not think that I am in love with him, but that I do reſent the very ſame beginings, which I remember I reſented at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of my affection unto <hi>Philander.</hi> I beſeech you, Siſter, (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea</hi> unto her) what is it which pleaſeth you beſt in him? Firſt, (ſaid <hi>Diana)</hi> I perceive, he never loved any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and this cannot be attributed unto any ſtupidity of his underſtanding, ſince he does plainly evidence the contrary by his diſcourſe: Then he does ſo handſomely ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and gives me ſuch an abſolute power over his will, as he never ſpeaks a word, but he fears the offending me. Then again, there is a continued and conſtant diſcretion in all the actions of his life, you ſhal never ſee him either too much or too little in any thing he does: and laſtly, which is the prime cauſe of my amity, I do think him to be an honeſt, plain, open-hearted man, and without vice. I do aſſure you, Siſter, (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea)</hi> I do obſerve the ſame qualities to be in this ſhepheard; and for my part, I do think, that if ever the heavens do deſtinate you to love any, you will be very happy in him. But let me tell you, that if you will avoid diſpleaſures, you muſt uſe all your prudence. I do wonder, Siſter, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> why you ſhould uſe this expreſſion unto me; for know, that though I do love him better then any other I ever ſaw, ſince the loſſe of <hi>Philander;</hi> yet, I would not have him to know it, or that I have any intention to let him ſerve me; and that if he ſhould be ſo bold, as to declare it unto me, I do aſſure him, I would treat him ſo, as he ſhould never dare to ſpeak of it twice unto me. But, Siſter, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> what is then your intention? To puniſh us both, anſwered <hi>Diana;</hi> I mean to chaſtiſe him for his preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in loving me, and alſo to puniſh my ſelfe, for my fault in liking him, to the end, we may both be more juſt, and better adviſed. But, Siſter, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> this deſigne in my apprehenſion is very pernicious; for by this, you bring your ſelfe no ſatisfaction, but much ſorrow, and perhaps extream ſhame. Take heed, leſt in holding a flint, you ſtrike fire, if you ſtrike it againſt any thing which is harder, and ſo the hidden fire diſcover it ſelfe. Young ſpirits and hearts, if they do love well, and if they be prudent, they will diſcreetly hide their affections, and not diſcloſe them unto any of their acquaintance; but, when they are ſtrucken, I mean, when they are rigorouſly uſed, then they are ſo tranſported with their paſſions, as it is impoſſible they ſhould diſſemble. And this, believe it, cannot be without abundance of vexation and ſorrow, in the ſoul of her that is concerned; for, on which ſide ſoever the reports go, they cannot be advantagious to the woman. Your wiſdome, Siſter, does enable you, to give very good counſell unto any other; but the wiſeſt eyes are often blinde in their own caſe: And this invites me to ask you, Whether do you love this ſhepheard? or you do not love him? for if you love him not, then break off all manner of conference, and all correſpondency with him, and ſo entirely and ſpeedily,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:53526:158"/>
that he may not have one ſpark of any hopes from you: And in this, do not flatter your ſelfe and ſay, that a woman cannot help it, if men will needs love her, no more then ſhe can hinder them from looking upon her; this is an excuſe to fool ſome ſilly perſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: For, at the very firſt, the fire muſt be quenched, all hopes muſt be taken from him, not in part, but totally and entirely. If there be found ſometimes ſome opinionative and obſtinate man, it is only for a few daies; for certainly, Love, no more then all other Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, cannot live without nutriment, and the proper nutriment of Love, is Hope. But then, if you do love, as you ſay, and as indeed he deſerves, then, Siſter, me thinks it is a great folly, to deprive your ſelfe of that which pleaſeth you. Siſter, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> that which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth is not alwaies honourable, nor reaſonable; and ſince they are not, vertue commands us to ſhun them; and, for my part, I had rather die, than do otherwiſe. I make no queſtion of it, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> for I am moſt confident of <hi>Diana's</hi> vertue. But pray let us ſee whether this act be contrary unto reaſon or honour. Is it any way in the world contrary to reaſon, to love a generous, wiſe, handſome, and diſcreet Shepheard? For my part, it ſeemes unto me ſo full of reaſon, as I can ſee no contrariety in it. Now any thing that is reaſonable, cannot be diſhonourable; and ſince it is not, why ſhould you not love him? It is an eaſy matter to conclude in the advantage of this ſhepheard, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> as long as none does contradict it; but to argue thus: Is it reaſonable that <hi>Diana,</hi> who hath ever held a good repatation amongſt the ſhepheards and ſhepheardeſſes of this Country, ſhould mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry an unknown ſhepheard? one, who has nothing but himſelfe, and what his ingennity acquires? I believe you will decline from your firſt opinion upon this conſideration: And upon this cauſe, I am fully reſolved to ſuffer his addreſſes and affection no longer, then I can faigne and ſeem not to believe it: But, if be ſhould bring me to that paſſe, as I could not umbrage my ſelfe under this ſhadow, I do proteſt I will preſently diſcard him and never permit him to ſee me; or, if he did either ſee me, or ſpeak to me, or love me, I will treat him in ſuch a manner, as he ſhall believe me in good earneſt, and, I think love me no longer. And what will you your ſelfe do, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> in the mean time? Doubtleſſe I will love him, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> and I will puniſh my ſelfe for my offence in ſo doing. I do foreſee, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that this vain Chimera will afford you but falſe contentment, and that this deſigne will beget in you many a mortall diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe ſhepheardeſſes were thus diſcourſing, and thinking that none did hear them, <hi>Laonice</hi> was ſo attentive, that not to loſe one ſyllable of what was ſaid, ſhe durſt hardly breathe, for, there was nothing which ſhe did ſo paſſionately deſire, as to diſcover this which ſhe heard. But <hi>Silvander</hi> was raviſhed, and when he heard at the beginning thoſe favourable expreſſions of <hi>Diana,</hi> Oh! how happy did he think himſelfe? Afterwards, when he heard the counſell which <hi>Aſtrea</hi> gave her, and how ſhe took his part, how much did he think himſelfe obliged? But when at laſt, he heard <hi>Diana's</hi> dire reſolution: Oh heavens! in what a dump was his ſoul ſmother'd? It was well for him, that theſe ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſes had a diſpoſition to ſleep, otherwiſe it had been impoſſible, but he ſhould have diſcovered himſelfe to be there, by ſome of his deep and groaning ſighes; for, he could not obtain ſo much of himſelfe, as to go further and ſigh at eaſe, ſo deſirous was he to hear the end of their diſcourſe; and therefore I ſay, it was well for him, that after they had bid goodnight unto each other, they preſently fell aſleep; for then he retired, and went to his companions, looking whether any of them were awake; and finding them to be all faſt aſleep, he began to entertain his own thoughts, and lifting up his eyes, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated upon the Stars, and the various Chimaeraes which were formed in the Clouds; but he found none amongſt them ſo various as his own thoughts, upon the diſcourſe which he had heard, buying his knowledge, that <hi>Diana</hi> loved him, very dear, making a doubt, whether he was more obliged to his curioſity, which let him know ſhe loved him, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliged unto it, for hearing that cruell reſolution which ſhe had taken. This imagination held a long debate in his ſoul: At laſt, Love, out of very pitty, cloſed his eyes, and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to fall aſleep.</p>
               <p>But now it is full time to return unto <hi>Celadon,</hi> whom we have long left in his Cell, without any company but his own thoughts, which had no other ſubject for themſelves, but his paſt happineſſe, and his preſent miſery. Fifteen or ſixteen daies paſſed thus on, with ſo little care of his life, that ſorrowes nouriſhed him more, then any other thing which he eat: All his delight was in his imaginations in which he paſſed away his daies and nights, which were all one to him, ſince being ſo diſtant from the eyes of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> all ſeemed dark. There was not one paſſage in all his life which came not then into his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory;
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:53526:158"/>
and to his miſery, he alwaies ſtayed longeſt upon thoſe, that were moſt ſad, as moſt ſuitable to his preſent condition: If at any time he had any more pleaſing, he preſently gave them a check, as not ſeaſonable for ſo ſad a ſoul, to ſee any contentment. Thus ſpending his time in ſuch ſad exerciſes, and his food being very bad, his countenance was ſo altered, as it was not knowable; and certainly he could not have lived long, if the heavens, (who perhaps reſerved him for ſome better fortune) had not ſent him ſome conſolation.</p>
               <p>The ſame day that he eſcaped out of <hi>Galathea's</hi> hands, by the help of <hi>Adamas, Silvia,</hi> and <hi>Leonida, Galathea</hi> was conſtrained to wait upon her Mother unto <hi>Marcelles,</hi> becauſe of ſome publick ceremonies of joy which they were to perform, for the happy ſucceſſe which <hi>Clidaman</hi> had in the Army of the <hi>Francs.</hi> But when ſhe came there, and heard that <hi>Celadon</hi> was eſcaped, ſhe was in ſuch a fury againſt <hi>Leonida,</hi> that ſhe forbid her to come into her preſence: This fair Nymph being weary of the Courts noiſe, ſhe retired to the houſe of her Uncle <hi>Adamas,</hi> who was as tender of her, as if ſhe had been his own Daughter, as well by reaſon of Conſanguinity, as becauſe ſhe was recommended unto him by <hi>Belizar</hi> his Brother, before his death. And though ſhe loſt all hopes from her paſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, yet, ſhe was very glad to recover her liberty at that rate; but much more, in hopes to ſee <hi>Celadon</hi> again, ſuppoſing he would be near <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> and though ſhe believed, his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection unto <hi>Aſtrea</hi> would daſh all her hopes in him, yet ſhe thought it would be a moſt pleaſing ſatisfaction unto her, to ſpend all her time neer him: And therefore finding <hi>Paris</hi> to be very well diſpoſed unto ſuch a viſit, about ſome two daies after ſhe came unto her Uncles, they went both together unto the Townes where theſe ſhepheardeſſes frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but when ſhe came there, and enquired of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and heard that he was not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, but that they all believed him to be dead, ſhe was extreamly aſtoniſhed: However, in ſatisfaction of <hi>Paris,</hi> who was an adorer of <hi>Diana,</hi> and in pleaſing her ſelfe with their good company; ſhe was a frequent viſitant, and grew into ſuch familiarity with theſe ſhepheardeſſes, that they did infinitely love her, and ſhe them, and lived with them as if ſhe were a ſhepheardeſſe, with which kinde of life, ſhe was ſo pleaſed, that ſhe would often go unto them with <hi>Paris,</hi> and it being not above a mile betwixt both their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, ſhe would often go by her ſelfe; and the way was ſo pleaſant, by reaſon of the delectable River of <hi>Lignon,</hi> and the delightfull Groves which ſhe went through, as it was impoſſible ſhe ſhould be weary. It hapned then, that reſolving one day to go alone, ſhe paſſed over the Bridge, and walking along the River ſide; though there was no path, yet the way was delightſome, by reaſon of the pleaſure ſhe took in looking at the fiſhes, which flocked by troopes unto the River ſide; and ſo delighting her ſelfe along the water ſide, ſhe came unawares unto the Fountain, where <hi>Celadon</hi> uſed to gather his <hi>VVater-Creſſes,</hi> which was his food. As fortune was, that ſhepheard being laid down, was fallen aſleep a little before. When the Nymph firſt ſpied him, ſhe took him for <hi>Lycidas,</hi> becauſe thoſe two Brothers were both of a ſtature and proportion, and uſed to habit themſelves both alike; and though <hi>Celadon</hi> was a little bigger, and had a more full and pleaſing face, yet comming neerer him, ſhe was miſtaken, as well, becauſe ſhe thought <hi>Celadon</hi> was not in that Country, as, becauſe his face was much changed; or elſe becauſe ſhe thought, that <hi>Lycidas</hi> being full of jealouſie, as ſhe knew he was, might very well be retired from all company into that ſolitary place: And therefore ſhe ſett her ſelf down by <hi>Celadon,</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be <hi>Lycidas;</hi> but ſeeing he did not wake, ſhe reſolved to go on her voyage, and leave him to his reſt: but before ſhe roſe, ſhe eſpied a little bag, wherein he was wont to keep his Letters, which hung a little out of his pocket; ſhe gently took them, without any diſturbance to his ſleep, and after this piece of theft, ſhe went away, leaving the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard aſleep, who preſently after awaked; and becauſe the Sun began to be hot, he went for ſhade unto the thickeſt part of the Wood: But the memory of his ſhepheardeſſe being the Center of all his thoughts, he opened a little Caſe which he wore about his neck, in which was the Picture of <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> and after he had a while contemplated it, he read theſe words, which formerly he had written upon the ſide of it.</p>
               <q>VVanting the Subſtance, Shaddowes comfort me.</q>
               <p>Alas poor miſerable <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſaid he, how canſt thou now ſay, that being deprived of the true good, the falſe ones ſhould comfort thee? The good thou haſt is meerly imaginary, and the true good is raviſhed from thee, by her who is the owner of it. Afterwards loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſeriouſly upon the Picture, and ſpeaking unto it, as if to <hi>Aſtrea</hi> her ſelfe: Is it poſſible
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:53526:159"/>
Oh my faireſt Shepheardeſſe, (ſaid he) that I ſhould thus diſpleaſe you? But is it poſſible, that having diſpleaſed you, I ſhould yet live? If I did diſpleaſe, it is abſolutely impoſſible that it ſhould be with my will; nor is it poſſible, I ſhould deſire to live after ſuch a crime. If ſhe would have me live, Oh! why does ſhe baniſh me from that place in which I can only live? And if ſhe would have me die, why does ſhe not poſitively command it? But alas, what more expreſſe command can I expect, then her command never to come into her preſence? She knowes, that the ſight of her is my life; and in forbidding me to ſee her, does ſhe not command me to die? This, doubtleſſe, were enough to make me ſeek a death, did I not know, how that which is reaſonable in the judgment of others, is without any ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of reaſon in her. All others think it a thing moſt juſt, to love thoſe that love her, and that amity ought to be rewarded with amity; but ſhe thinks it reaſonable, to hate thoſe who do love and adore her. Why then ſhould I not think, that this command of living from her, is rather to make me live and ſuffer the more, then to abridge my pain by an anticipated death? But that cannot be it which ſhe requires of me; for ſhe knowes well enough, that I am not able to live ſo. Did ſhe ever demand of me any proofes, but ſuch as are impoſſible? witneſſe this command from her own mouth, and thoſe Letters, by which ſhe commanded me to counterfeit affection unto another. Then ſhutting up that dear Picture to read thoſe Letters which ſhe had ſent him: Well, ſaid he ſince I muſt not live to my own contentment, I will live to her glory. Then putting up the little caſe into his breaſt, he put his hand into his pocket, to take the Letters which were in a little bag, but when he could not finde them, he turned out all that he had in both his pockets, and not yet finding them, he went to his Cave, thinking that he had left them there; but not fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them neither, there was not a tuſt in all the Cave, nor betwixt the Cave and the Fountain, nor between the fountain, and all the places he had been at that day, but he turned it over and over; nay, not a leaf which was likely to hide them, but he ſought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it; ſo vexed was he at the loſſe, and ſo deſirous was he to finde them: For, as theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were infinitely dear unto him, as being written by the fair hand of his deareſt ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe; ſo he loved them, as the witneſſes of his fidelity, and as the ſweeteſt entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he had in the miſerable life which he led. At laſt, ſeeing all his laborious queſt to be in vain, and that there was no hopes of finding theſe beloved Letters: Alas, alas, (ſaid he, lifting his eyes up to heaven) what unjuſt <hi>Daemon</hi> hath raviſhed from me that little remnant of contentment which I had? for a <hi>Daemon</hi> certainly it muſt needs be, ſince no mortall ever uſeth to come hither; or if they did, they would never have been ſo cruell. Well, well, <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſaid he, yet thou art happy in this thy miſerable life, though thou haſt loſt thoſe happy teſtimonies of thy paſt felicity; comfort thy ſelfe in thy loſſe, and render thanks unto heaven, that hath made thee ſo conformable unto the will of thy dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſhepheardeſſe, and make it appear, that neither her rigour, nor the force of Fate, can ever make thee weary in obeying her, nor ever ſeparate thee from the thoughts of her; it is but ſit, that ſince thou haſt loſt her good-will, thou ſhouldeſt alſo loſe all manner of conſolation.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Leonida</hi> rejoyced very much in her Larcenie, and having got a good diſtance from this ſhepheard, ſhe opened the little bag which contained theſe Letters, which ſhe believed had been written by the hand of <hi>Phillis;</hi> and being out of meaſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to ſee into the ſecrets of that ſhepheardeſſe, ſhe poured them out into her lap, and the firſt which ſhe light upon, was this.</p>

                  <hi>Leonida</hi> read this Letter, not well knowing what ſhe did: Now ſhe began to ſuſpect, that it was <hi>Celadon</hi> and not <hi>Lycidas;</hi> and much more, when ſhe remembered, that <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathea</hi> had ſpoken to her of ſome ſuch Letters. Oh heavens! ſaid ſhe, certainly it is <hi>Celadon:</hi> Where was my eyes, that I could not know him when I ſaw him? Then ſhe lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up the Letters, and went with all ſpeed unto the Fountain, where ſhe left him; but extreamly angry ſhe was with her ſelfe, when ſhe found him not there, and broke into many expreſſions of griefe: Then ſhe turned about every way, to ſee if ſhe could finde any relicks of him; but he was retired into his Cave, after his long and laborious ſearch, for what ſhe had ſtolne. At the laſt, Love, which is alwaies very circumſpect, prompted her to take notice, that the graſſe about the Fountain was troden, and that there was a new Path, not halfe beaten; ſhe imagined very aptly, that this Path would conduct her to the place where the ſhepheard was: And indeed, <hi>Celadon</hi> uſing to paſſe between his Cave and that place, had made a kinde of a Path. <hi>Leonida</hi> then taking it for her guide; ſhe had not followed it foure or five hundred paces, but ſhe came to the Rock, where <hi>Celadon</hi> made his retreat; yet, the trees and buſhes being very thick about it, ſhe was afraid to approach neer, leſt it ſhould prove the den of ſome Wolfe or wilde Boar, or at the leaſt, of many Serpents. As ſhe was ſtanding thus in ſuſpence, ſhe thought that ſhe heard him breathe, which aſſured her, that ſome was there; but knowing, that Serpents do ſometimes hiſſe in the ſame manner, ſhe therefore trode very circumſpectly and cautiouſly, and ſo ſoftly, that <hi>Celadon</hi> never perceived her: And though ſhe did afterwards make ſome noiſe, yet the ſhepheard was ſo attentive upon his own thoughts, that he took no notice of her. Now ſhe was got ſo neer the entrance, that ſhe heard him breathe plainly, and ſometimes ſpeak, yet ſhe could not underſtand the words; but comming a little neer, and putting her head a little into the entrance, ſhe heard him ſay thus: Now heart begin to hope well; for, as the ſnuffe of the Lamp ceaſeth to burn, when the flame hath conſumed all the Oyle; ſo may I hope my miſeries will ceaſe,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:53526:160"/>
having by little and little conſumed all the comforts and contentments that I have. Oh happy loſſe! how I would cheriſh thee, if by thy means, I go out of this miſerable life which I lead? Oh my deareſt Papers! how I would bleſſe the day on which you were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed from me, if my grieving for your loſſe would end <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>? For, alas! there is no hopes left, that my ſorrowes ſhould ever end, but with my life. <hi>Leonida</hi> hearing this, was moved with much compaſſion knowing him now to be <hi>Celadon;</hi> and was alſo ſurpriſed with ſuch a ſudden joy, that though ſhe had a great deſire to let him complain on, and hearken longer what he ſaid; yet, ſhe was conſtrained to go to him with open armes, and cry unto him: Ah <hi>Celadon,</hi> away with theſe lamentations and ſorrowes, you have had too many of them; 'tis time now to change your courſe of life, and enjoy ſome pleaſant dayes. You may eaſily imagine, that <hi>Celadon</hi> was extreamly ſurpriſed, when he heard this voice upon a ſudden, and ſeeing her come unto him, for he had not ſeen any of a long time; and his ſpirits being wholly retired into his thoughts, ſhe had ſpoken all this, before he heard or knew what ſhe ſaid. He ſtarted up upon a ſudden, but the life which he had lived, and bad food together, had ſo weakened him, that he was conſtrained to ſit down again preſently. Then the Nymph gave him leaſure to recollect himſelfe, and ſitting down by him, took him by the hand.</p>
               <p>Well <hi>Celadon,</hi> (ſaid ſhe unto him) did you ſo impatiently deſire to get out of <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi>'s hands, only to live thus? Is it poſſible, our company ſhould be ſo diſpleaſing to you, that you had rather be amongſt ſenſleſſe Rocks and wild Woods? The Shepheard having recollected his ſpirits, did faintly anſwer: You ſee, fair <hi>Leonida,</hi> unto what Love hath brought me, and what power you have over thoſe that love you. How is it poſſible, ſaid ſhe, that Love ſhould make you thus neglect your own preſervation? Is it poſſible, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſhepheard, that you, who vaunts to know what Love is, ſhould doubt, but that my affection can endure the greateſt extremities? However, replyed the Nymph, if I were condemned to die, I would at the leaſt ask him that condemned me, the reaſon why I am condemned. What better reaſon can be given, ſaid <hi>Celadon,</hi> then that ſhe, who has the ſoveraigne power over me, will have it ſo? ſo as the reaſon of my ill-being is, becauſe my well-being diſpleaſeth her. Oh <hi>Celadon!</hi> (ſaid the Nymph, and pittyed him) in what a miſerable condition you are? See, ſage Nymph, ſaid he, how you are miſtaken, I cannot deſire more happineſſe, then the miſery which I endure; for, can I wiſh a greater happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then to pleaſe her? If my miſery pleaſe her can I grieve for it? No, no, I muſt rejoyce at whatſoever is pleaſing unto her. Oh happy <hi>Celadon</hi> (ſaid he) and in one thing the more happy, that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> does not know that thou art happy. <hi>Leonida</hi> hearing theſe expreſſions, ſtood aſtoniſhed, and looked upon him with admiration: At laſt, after ſhe had been a long while mute, ſhe ſaid unto him: I muſt needs confeſſe, ſhepheard, that if this be the way to love, there is only you amongſt all men living, that can follow it. But, ſhepheard, take heed, that as many good things are corrupted and ſpoiled with abuſe, ſo your melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and obſtinacy do not corrupt your affection. I care not for all the accidents that can come, ſaid the ſhepheard, ſo my Love be not offended. But, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> do you love <hi>Aſtrea?</hi> You aske me a queſtion, anſwered he, unto which you are able to give an anſwer your ſelfe. If you do love her, (ſaid the Nymph) you ought to love all that's hers, and if ſo, then you ought to love your ſelfe, ſince you are ſo entirely hers, that you are not your own. Since I do love <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> replyed the ſhepheard, I ought to hate all that ſhe hates: <hi>Aſtrea</hi> hates the miſerable <hi>Celadon,</hi> why then, fair Nymph, ſhould not I? Every one, ſaid ſhe, is obliged, to have a greater care of their own preſervation, then of the love or hatred of any other. That Law, ſaid the ſhepheard, is good and allowable amongſt Men, but not amongſt Lovers. Why, ſaid the Nymph, do they ceaſe to be Men, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Lovers? If you do mean a man, ſaid he, that is ſubject unto all ſorts of miſeries and inquiotudes, I do confeſſe, that a Lover remaines a Man ſtill; but, if that Man have any will of his own, and judges of things as they are, and not according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of another I deny, that a Lover is a man, ſince as ſoon as ever he becomes a Lover, he does ſo diſpoſſeſſe himſelfe of his will and judgment, as he neither willeth nor judgeth, but as ſhe willeth and judgeth whom he loves. Oh, the miſerable condition of a Lover! (ſaid the Nymph). But much more miſerable (anſwered the ſhepheard) is he, that loves not, ſince he cannot enjoy the moſt perfect and higheſt happineſſe, that the world affords; for, the very leaſt of Loves joyes, does exceed all others that the world hath without it. Is there any pleaſure comparable unto thoſe, that conſiſt in the thought? When a Lover thinks upon the beauty of her that he loves; nay, when he does but remember any one of
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:53526:160"/>
her actions, nay, even the very place where he laſt ſaw her; do you think he would change his contentment, for any diverſion in the whole Univerſe? He is ſo jealous, and ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to entertain this very thought, that leſt he ſhould make any a ſharer with him, he will retire into the moſt ſolitary and unfrequented places, that he can finde; he cares not for the ſociety of men, or all the delights that men can deviſe, and uſe to court with ſuch care, ſo he may but enjoy his own thoughts. Now, <hi>Leonida,</hi> ſince the contentment of thoughts are ſuch, is it poſſible, the weakneſſe of any human heart ſhould think to endure ſo much bliſſe, as to enjoy the ſight of her whom he loves, to hear her ſpeak, to kiſſe her hand, to hear her own mouth pronounce the word, <hi>I love you?</hi> Is it poſſible he ſhould hear this, and not be raviſhed, and be diſordered with too much felicity and delight? I do not mention thoſe great and laſt aſſurances, which one receives when he is loved, nor thoſe languiſhments in the breaſt of the perſon loved; for, theſe are contentments of ſo high a nature, as they cannot be guſted without tranſport, and abſolute raviſhment out of our ſelves, nor can they be expreſſed by any words, unleſſe imperfectly. Now tell me, fair Nymph, whether the condition of a Lover be ſo miſerable now, I ſay, when you know what high felicities he does enjoy? I do confeſſe, (ſaid the Nymph, after ſhe had heard him with admiration) that <hi>Celadon</hi> does love, if to love be, to be out of his wits, and to live only upon bare thoughts. Alas! I cannot chuſe but think his condition extreamly miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, in finding ſuch contentments in ſuch vain imaginations and Chimeraes; and I am ſo far from thinking them felicities, as my opinion of the contrary is much fortified. But Shepheard, let us leave this diſcourſe, ſince I ſee it will do you no good, and tell me, how you have lived ſince I left you? Wiſe Nymph, anſwered <hi>Celadon,</hi> as I have lived ſince you met me, ſo have I lived ſince I parted from you; for, as ſoon as ever I left you, I ſhut my ſelfe up in this place, expecting untill either Love or Death releaſed me. But why, <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſaid ſhe, do you not go unto your own Town, where your friends and kindred do ſo much grieve for you? <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> ſaid he, who has a far greater power over me, than either any Parents or friends, hath forbidden me ever to ſee her, untill ſhe command; and therefore, as I told you, I have ſhut my ſelfe up in this Cell, untill either Love or Death releaſe me. But, if my adored Shepheardeſſe had commanded me never to ſee her again, doubtleſſe I had ſhut my ſelfe up in my grave with death: And as ſoon as I came to my ſelfe again, after my fall into the River, I knew, that <hi>Lignon</hi> would not give me a death, becauſe ſhe did not peremptorily command it; but, remembering her words, and that her baniſhment of me was not for ever, only untill ſhe commanded me to return, I have lived in this manner as you ſee, expecting till Love recall me, as it ſeemes ſhe hath promiſed; or elſe untill death do it for her, which ſhall be welcome unto me in this life which I live. But poor deceived ſhepheard, replyed the Nymph, how can you ever hope ſhe ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call you, as long as ſhe is ignorant where you are? Love, anſwered he, which conducted me hither, knowes the place well enough where I am, and does daily viſit me; and ſince it is by it, that I do hope ſhe will recall me, there is no doubt, but it will without me let her know the place, unto which it hath conducted me. If your imaginations, replyed the Nymph, had an influence upon others, as they have upon your ſelfe, all this you ſay might perhaps be; but believe it, ſhepheard, the gods will never help thoſe, who will not help themſelves; and do not think, that I ſpeak without good reaſon, for I am very certain, that if <hi>Aſtrea</hi> did know you were alive, ſhe would paſſionately deſire your company. How fair Nymph, (ſaid he preſently) do you know that? I know it, ſaid ſhe, by that ſadneſſe which ſits in her face. Perhaps, ſaid the ſhepheard, that proceeds from ſome other cauſe. But where have you ſeen her ſince we parted? I ſhall be very glad, ſaid ſhe, to entertain you with a diſcourſe upon this ſubject, and to relate unto you all that hath hapned ſince we parted, ſo I can but by it cheer you a little up, and rouſe you out of this dull kinde of life. Believe it (ſaid <hi>Celadon)</hi> that the ſight of you does bring me more content, then any thing in the world could, except <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> and ſince I am deprived of her, your diſcourſe will be very pleaſing unto me. Then <hi>Leonida</hi> began thus.</p>

               <p>SInce, <hi>Celadon,</hi> you do deſire to know, how I have lived ſince I parted from you, which is ſome fifteen or ſixteen daies ſince, I will very willingly make a relation of it unto you, upon a condition that if you be weary with the length of the diſcourſe, we may
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:53526:161"/>
break it off, and finiſh it another time, when any convenient opportunity ſhall preſent it ſelfe. Know therefore, that in my return from conducting you, I came into the Palace of <hi>Iſſoures,</hi> at the ſame time when <hi>Amaſis</hi> was taking Coach, to go unto <hi>Marcelies,</hi> and carrying <hi>Galathea</hi> with her; becauſe being deſirous to render thanks unto <hi>Heſius,</hi> for the happy ſucceſſe of her Son <hi>Clidaman,</hi> which he had in the Battle againſt the <hi>Neuſtrians,</hi> ſhe would by all means have <hi>Galathea</hi> with her, purpoſely to render the ſolemnity more celebrated. And becauſe retardment in ſuch actions as theſe, does in ſome ſort reſemble oblivion; and oblivion, ingratitude; ſhe departed ſo ſoon, that ſhe ſcarcely gave the Nymph time to tell us what we ſhould do with you; and though ſhe was extreamly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at it, yet ſhe durſt not let it appear, leſt <hi>Amaſis</hi> ſhould take notice of it, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies held her by the hand, not out of any ſuſpition, but only the more to carraſſe her. ſhe being thus conſtrained to go with her into the Coach, all that ſhe could do, was to ſay thus unto me: You, <hi>Silvia,</hi> and <hi>Lucinde,</hi> come after us in my Coach, and follow us with all the haſte you can. I made a low reverence, and ſhewed by my actions, that I did underſtand what ſhe ſaid; but I did not intend to obey her, becauſe my aimes were only upon you: And though I did well enough foreſee her anger, yet, I preferred the good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which I intended to you, above it, chuſing rather to fail in my duty to that Nymph, then in my affection to you. However, faigning as if my going out were in obedience to my Uncle, I met <hi>Silvia,</hi> who was in queſt of me, and I told her, how you was eſcaped, whilſt none took any notice of you. But I was never in all my life ſo ſurpriſed, as when in my return from you, I met <hi>Amaſis</hi> and <hi>Galathea,</hi> as they were taking Coach; for, I had been utterly undone, if they had ſpied me out of the dores. But I did addreſſe my ſelfe unto my Uncle and <hi>Silvia:</hi> Father, ſaid I unto him, and ſmiled, and you my dear Companion, you muſt needs both of you help me out in this buſineſſe. Daughter, anſwered <hi>Adamas,</hi> never fear any blame for what you have done, as long as it is but what you ought to do, nor ever grieve upon ſuch occaſions; the gods, upon whom all events depend, are ſo juſt, as they will ever bear you out; and if at any time the contrary ſeem to happen, take ſpeciall notice, Daughter, that it is to redouble the contentment, and as if they hapned only to augment your joyes. And becauſe it is very expedient, you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to preſerve your ſelfe in the favour of your Miſtreſſe, <hi>Silvia</hi> ſhall teſtifie, that you did not any thing, but what ſhe knowes of very well; and to make the matter more eaſie for you, I am contented, that you ſhall both of you have ſome ſuſpition of me; for, I ſhall not be ſorry that he ſhould think, that I do hate any thing which is contrary unto vertue: and I would permit you to charge me down-right with the act, but that it is neceſſary I ſhould be ſomething in her eſteem, only to draw her off from thoſe fooliſh and falſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, which <hi>Climanthes</hi> hath infuſed into her. With ſuch diſcourſe as this, my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle did encourage us to continue in this laudable deſigne: Afterwards he went home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and we towards <hi>Marcelles;</hi> but firſt conſulted together, what Anſwers ſhould be given unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> leſt we ſhould contradict one another, knowing very well, that no eye is ſo quick and penetrating, as the eye of Jealouſie. In the mean time, <hi>Galathea</hi>'s minde was only on her dear <hi>Lucinde,</hi> commending my wit and ſubtlety in putting you into that habit, hoping, that under that ſhadow, ſhe might without any ſuſpition have you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies with her; not, ſhepheard, that ſhe had ever any unchaſt or unworthy thoughts, but deſigning to marry you, and not daring to declare it as long as <hi>Amaſis</hi> lived, ſhe thought ſhe might alwaies have you in her preſence under that umbrage. And though ſhe could not doubt of the affection which you had unto the fair <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> yet flattering her ſelfe ſhe hoped, that the ſight of ſo much grandore and magnificence, would eaſily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw your love from that ſhepheardeſſe; ſo as hugging her ſelfe in theſe thoughts, ſhe was the moſt contented woman in the world, and nothing ſeemed tedious into her, but the length of the way: But, when ſhe came to <hi>Marcelles,</hi> and did not ſee her dearly beloved <hi>Lucinde</hi> amongſt the reſt of her Nymphs, Oh! how ſhe was diſordered? and what haſte did ſhe make in going to her Chamber, and from her Chamber into her Cloſet? I, who plainly foreſaw this ſtorme, did follow her, but not with that alacrity as uſuall; and I muſt needs confeſſe, that being in ſome ſort guilty of treaſon, I did fear her preſence; and yet, leſt ſhe ſhould ſuſpect me, as ſoon as ſhe did call, I ran unto her, and commanding me to ſhut the dore: Well <hi>Leonida,</hi> (ſaid ſhe unto me) what's become of <hi>Celadon?</hi> Madam, (ſaid I unto her, ſeeming much aſtoniſhed and diſpleaſed) I cannot tell; for, as ſoon as ever you were gone, <hi>Silvia</hi> and I looked for him all over the Palace, and not finding him, we cannot deviſe what ſhould become of him, unleſſe <hi>Adamas</hi> can tell us. How's this, (ſaid
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:53526:161"/>
                  <hi>Galathea,</hi> ſurpriſed at this unexpected anſwer) do you know no more of him? And ſeeing I did not anſwer: Did not I command you, ſaid ſhe, to have extraordinary care of him? Am I no better obeyed than thus? Go, go, <hi>Leonida,</hi> go immediately to your Uncle; if <hi>Celadon</hi> be there, bring him hither, or otherwiſe, never come again into my preſence; and aſſure your ſelfe, I ſhall make you fell the ſmart of this offence, as well as my ſelfe. Seeing her ſo angry, and fearing, that replies would but aggravate, I made her a low and humble reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, I went away, to acquaint my Companions with it. <hi>Silvia</hi> not being far off, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me out of the Chamber, and I acquainted her with all the diſcourſe of <hi>Galathea,</hi> and how ſhe commanded me to retire. I knew, ſaid <hi>Silvia,</hi> that it was impoſſible this buſineſſe ſhould end, without making her extreamly angry; but I ſhould have imagined any thing, rather than this courſe ſhe hath taken: What will every one think of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture? How can ſhe hide it from <hi>Amaſis?</hi> Well, my dear Companion, (ſaid ſhe unto me) I ſee, all the blame is laid upon you, though I have equally contributed to the ſame fault, (if that which we have done deſerve not praiſe) but ſince it is ſo, I ſhall uſe all my beſt endeavours, to have you recalled as ſoon as poſſible: In the mean time, if any enquire of me the cauſe of your abſence, I ſhall ſay, That <hi>Adamas</hi> deſired <hi>Galathea,</hi> to let you be with him for a certain time, in hopes that ſome affection may grow betwixt his Son <hi>Paris</hi> and you; and I ſhall ſay this as a ſecret, to the end it may make the leſſe noiſe in the world. After this, we kiſſed, and recommended each other to the tuition of the gods: And ſo I went unto my Uncle, unto whom I related the whole paſſage.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, <hi>Galathea</hi> being alone in her Cloſet, and ſeeing all her hopes, and all her deſignes blaſted, ſhe was ſo ſurpriſed with ſorrow, as ſhe laid her ſelfe down upon a green Bed, and could ſcarcely breathe: At laſt, ſhe ſtarted up with a deep ſigh, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting her eyes upon a great Glaſſe which was over againſt her, ſhe ſaw the tears that trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down her cheeks: Alas, alas, <hi>Galathea,</hi> ſaid ſhe, what is thy Beauty worth, which hath cauſed ſo many Idolaters, ſince it is not able to captivate him, whom thou moſt deſireſt to pleaſe? a poor deſpiſable Shepheard deſpiſeth it. Am I not the moſt unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate woman in the world, ſince a mean and ungratefull Shepheardeſſe is able to do more then I am? Oh! how pleaſing and ſweet were my deſignes, at the firſt; and at the laſt, how bitter and vexatious are they all turned? Then being ſilent for a while, ſhe broke out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: But is it poſſible, <hi>Celadon,</hi> thou ſhouldſt not love me? Can I no way wean thy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from a ſilly ſhepheardeſſe? Can a ruſtick country Beauty have a greater influence upon thee than mine? Has the heavens, to torment me, made thee ſo pleaſing and ſo ſilly? She had continued longer in theſe exclamations, had not <hi>Silvia</hi> knocked at the dore, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her, that <hi>Amaſis</hi> her Mother was comming to ſee her. She preſently drying up her tears as well as ſhe could, and lying down upon the bed, ſhe put a handkerchiefe over her face, feigning to be aſleep; and therefore <hi>Silvia</hi> went to meet <hi>Amaſis</hi> at the dore, and acquainted her, how <hi>Galathea</hi> was not well, telling her, that ſhe thought her diſeaſe to be nothing but a little head-ach, which a little reſt would cure. <hi>Amaſis</hi> did eaſily believe it, when going neerer <hi>Galathea,</hi> ſhe ſaw her face red, and burn like fire. The Nymph, at the comming of her Mother, ſeemed as if ſhe were aſleep, and ſtarting up, did her reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto her; and holding her hand before the eyes, ſhe confirmed what <hi>Silvia</hi> had ſaid. <hi>Amaſis</hi> adviſed her to go into bed, and to reſt that night, that ſhe might be better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be a ſpectator of the publick Bone-fires of joy, which were to be made, and laſt two or three daies. After this, ſhe retired, purpoſely to give her the more time of reſt. <hi>Galathea</hi> was very glad of this excuſe to be along; and when all was gone out of her Chamber ſhe undreſſed her ſelfe, and went to bed, ſuffering none to be in the Chamber but <hi>Silvia,</hi> whom ſhe commanded to ſtay by the bed ſide, that ſhe might near if ſhe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. <hi>Silvia,</hi> who knew her diſeaſe, prepared her ſelf with remedies accordingly; but ſhe was miſtaken, for the Nymph ſtayed untill it was night, and never gave one word, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that <hi>Silvia</hi> ſhould firſt begin. At laſt, when it was ſupper time: Go <hi>Silvia,</hi> ſaid ſhe, go to ſupper, and ſend ſome other in you room; as for me, I will not eate any thing. Madam, anſwered <hi>Silvia,</hi> I beſeech you give me leave to ſtay with you; for, my meat will not do me any good, as long as you are not well. Sweet-heart, ſaid the Nymph, I thank you, and believe it, I take you good-will unto me very kindely, in ſpite of the ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude which I finde in others. But tell me freely and ingenuouſly, I intreat you (ſaid ſhe, and drew the Curtains) did you ever obſerve, that <hi>Leonida</hi> helped <hi>Celadon</hi> to eſcape? Madam anſwered <hi>Silvia</hi> if ſhe did, I muſt needs ſay, ſhe is the moſt ſubtle woman that ever lived, for ſhe never ſtirred one ſtep without me; and if you will be pleaſed to let me tell you
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:53526:162"/>
what I think, I will aſſure you, Madam, that if any helped him to eſcape, it was <hi>Adamas;</hi> for I obſerved, that as ſoon as ever you were ſet at dinner, he took <hi>Celadon</hi> apart, and talked with him very paſſionately a long time. Moreover, I obſerved, that after you were gone, when he ſaw us ſearching all about, and much troubled, he ſmiled two or three times and told us, that it had been well, if <hi>Celadon</hi> had never come there. How, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> is it ſo then, that <hi>Leonida</hi> never conſented unto it? Madam, (anſwered <hi>Silvia,</hi> very diſcreetly) I will not ſwear ſhe is innocent, but I dare ſwear, that I think ſhe is not; and that if any be to blame, beſides that ungratefull ſhepheard, it is <hi>Adamas.</hi> Do not tell me thus, ſaid ſhe, to excuſe your Companion; I know that you are very good, but had ſhe any advantage over you, ſhe would make uſe of it againſt you; ſhe is the craftieſt and moſt jealous, that ever I ſaw of all thoſe that are about me, and eſpecially when I ſpeak of you. Madam, anſwered <hi>Silvia,</hi> the conſideration of any of my Companions, ſhall never make me fail in the duty which I do owe unto you; and as for their envie and jealouſie, it ſhall never make me ſtart or recoile from my well wiſhes unto <hi>Leonida;</hi> for I believe that if ſhe did not love you, ſhe would never be jealous of any that comes about you. Sweet-heart, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> and kiſſing her, I do finde you ſo diſcreet for your age, as for your ſake, I will recall <hi>Leonida,</hi> whom I have forbid my houſe; but with this intention, that you ſhall be alwaies neereſt unto me, and unto you I will impart all my ſecrets; your young years hath hitherto kept me ſomething reſerved from you, but now I finde, that though you be young in years, yet you are old in wiſdome and diſcretion: and therefore from henceforth keep as near me as you can; and though I do not call you, yet enter freely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what place ſoever I am, for I would have it ſo. And to the end <hi>Leonida</hi> ſhould think her ſelfe obilged unto you, ſend her word what you have done for her, and bid her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. Madam, (anſwered <hi>Silvia,</hi> and making low reverence) the honour which you do me is ſo great, that I ſhall never forget it, and ſhall not think, that any merits of my own, but only your free goodneſſe, did invite you to do me this honour; I ſhall receive it as the greateſt bleſſing: of heaven, and do vow, Madam, that I will never fail in that fidelity, which is owing unto your ſervice, more then I will in my duty to the gods themſelves. And as concerning <hi>Leonida,</hi> would it not be expedient, that you ſtayed untill the day of publick joy, when <hi>Adamas</hi> will be there, to the end, you may ſeem as if you remitted the offence for his ſake? But, ſweet-heart, anſwered ſhe it is <hi>Adamas</hi> that I am angry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, for it is he that hath offended me. Madam, replyed <hi>Silvia,</hi> give me leave to tell you, what counſell my Mother gave unto me when I left her: Daughter, (ſaid ſhe unto me) whenſoever any of your Companions does you any injury, remember that you never ſhew as if you wiſhed them any ill, untill you have found the means how to be revenged; for, if you do it at another ſeaſon, and ſhew teeth before you be able to bite, it will but exaſperate them the more againſt you. So, Madam, you ſhould not ſhew your ſelfe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at <hi>Adamas,</hi> untill you can make him reſent your diſpleaſure, leſt when he ſees himſelfe out of your favour, he ſhould either ſay or do ſomething, that may more diſpleaſe you. Thus by the prudence of this Nymph, <hi>Galathea</hi>'s anger againſt me, was partly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated, and ſhe reſolved to make no ſhew of any diſpleaſure to my Uncle, untill times changed; of which, <hi>Silvia</hi> did preſently advertiſe me, to the end, <hi>Adamas</hi> might be at the Feaſts, which <hi>Amaſis</hi> prepared.</p>
               <p>But in the mean time, <hi>Polemas</hi> was not without abundance of vexation; for he ſaw, that by every Letter which came from the Army, <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ndamor</hi> was highly extolled, and the Trumpet of Fame ſounded his name louder then any's elſe, and thereby extreamly eclipſed the glory of his Rivall; But that which vexed him to the heart, was, The Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of <hi>Climanthes</hi> did not operate unto his advantage, and not knowing what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him, he was the moſt blanked man that ever was, yet, though he did daily ſee the Nymph, and often talk with her, he never ſeemed to take any notice of it; ſo as one day as <hi>Galathea</hi> was talking with him, to try whether what I had told her concerning the ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem of <hi>Polemas</hi> and <hi>Climanthes</hi> was true, he ſeemed to know ſo little concerning it, that the Nymph believed, I had invented all thoſe tricks to the advantage of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> as I heard ſince by the report of <hi>Silvia,</hi> to whom <hi>Galathea</hi> imparted every thing.</p>
               <p>However, I lived a life in the mean time not diſagreeable to my minde, had I had the happineſſe which now I have, of ſeeing you. For, <hi>Celadon,</hi> you muſt know, that <hi>Paris</hi> is ſo extreamly in Love with <hi>Diana,</hi> as he, quitting his former garb, is now in the habit of a ſhepheard, and affects no exerciſes, but ſuch as belongs to them. Do you mean that <hi>Diana,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Celadon)</hi> which is Daughter unto the wiſe <hi>Belinde?</hi> The ſame, anſwered
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:53526:162"/>
the Nymph. I aſſure you, ſaid the ſhepheard, ſhe is one of the faireſt, the wiſeſt, and moſt accompliſhed ſhepheardeſſes, that I know, and one who deſerves a good fortune; and I pray unto <hi>Tautates,</hi> that ſhe may enjoy all the good fortune in the world. I am of your opinion, ſaid the Nymph; but I do not believe, that ſhe will marry <hi>Paris,</hi> for ſhe has told me, that truly ſhe does love and honour him, that ſhe knowes what an honour it is he ſhould make any addreſſes unto her, and what a great advantage ſuch a Match would be to her; but yet, though ſhe knowes not why ſhe cannot love him otherwiſe then as a Brother, and that though ſhe knowes him to be a man of great merit, yet ſhe can love him no otherwiſe. How, (ſaid <hi>Celadon,</hi> and interrupted her) does ſhe ſpeak of theſe things ſo familiarly unto you? I aſſure you, I think it very ſtrange, when I remember her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which was wont to be ſo reſerved and cloſe, even from her beſt beloved Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> that they knew very little of her intentions. Oh ſhepheard! (anſwered the Nymph) there is great alterations within this three or foure Months, ſince you have been there; for <hi>Aſtrea, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> are all one, they are alwaies together; and ſince your ſuppoſed loſſe, <hi>Diana</hi> may be ſaid to ſucceed in your room. Moreover, if you remember <hi>Silvander,</hi> whom they called, the Shepheard without affection, he is now ſo deeply in love, that except <hi>Celadon,</hi> none is comparable to him; and it came thus to paſſe: <hi>Phillis</hi> and he fell into ſome difference concerning their merits; and becauſe that ſhepheard, being educated in the Maſſilian Schooles, and having an excellent acute wit, did produce better and more valid reaſons, then that ſhepheardeſſe could, ſhe, out of a pleaſant humour, propounded, that <hi>Silvander,</hi> to give a teſtimony of his merits, ſhould court and ſerve <hi>Diana</hi> with as much obſequious obſervance, as if he did really love her. The ſhepheard accepted of the propoſition, upon condition, that <hi>Phillis</hi> ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to do the ſame. After much diſcuſſion, <hi>Aſtrea, Diana,</hi> and I, did ordain, that both of them ſhould court and ſerve the ſame ſhepheardeſſe, and that at the three months end, that ſhepheardeſſe ſhould judge, which of them two had moſt merits to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves loved. This being thus reſolved, <hi>Diana</hi> was made choice of to be their Miſtreſſe; ſo as ſince this time, <hi>Phillis</hi> hath acted a paſſionate part ſo very well, as no ſhepheard could better acquit himſelfe. Now, ſee what is the iſſue of this fiction, <hi>Silvander,</hi> who, as I told you, was all inſenſibility, is become by his counterfeiting ſo deſperately in love with <hi>Diana,</hi> as every one does plainly ſee that he goes farther then the bounds of a ſiction; and I know, that <hi>Diana</hi> will give her judgment on his ſide; for, though ſhe is a ſhepheardeſſe of great modeſty and wiſdome, yet it is well enough known, that this courtſhip does not diſpleaſe her; and for my part, I muſt confeſſe, that I know no ſhepheard, except <hi>Celadon,</hi> who is more worthy to be loved. And becauſe of this faigned courtſhip, <hi>Phillis</hi> is almoſt continually with <hi>Diana,</hi> and <hi>Silvander</hi> leaves her as ſeldome as poſſibly he can. <hi>Lycidas,</hi> your Brother, thinks, that there is a matter of Love betwixt <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Silvander,</hi> and is ſo fully perſwaded of it, as he is ſo jealous, that he cannot endure they ſhould be together. And ſince <hi>Phillis</hi> cannot baniſh her ſelfe from the company of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and ſince <hi>Diana</hi> is alwaies with <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and <hi>Silvander</hi> with <hi>Diana,</hi> poor <hi>Lycidas,</hi> not being able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it, never ſees <hi>Phillis,</hi> unleſſe at ſuch meetings when he cannot avoid it. This is a great alteration indeed (anſwered the ſad <hi>Celadon)</hi> and I muſt confeſſe they are all much to be pittyed, eſpecially <hi>Lycidas,</hi> who is fallen into the very worſt diſeaſe of Love; but I do not think it ſtrange, for I know, the nature of my Brothers temper was alwaies apt to take ſuch impreſſions: For my part, I muſt proteſt, that we are not Brothers in that: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny, but that I was once jealous, but I think it is, becauſe all Lovers are once in their lives ſubject unto it, as they ſay little Children are, of a certain dangerous malady, which never comes unto them but once. <hi>Phillis</hi> alſo is to blame, who, having given ſo many aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances of her good-will unto <hi>Lycidas,</hi> will ſuffer him to enter into any doubt of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; but I do believe, that ſhe knowing this jealouſie of my Brother does proceed from an exceſſe of Love, ſhe ſuffers it with more patience. As for <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> I muſt confeſſe, it is impoſſible, that two ſubjects for love ſhould be more equally met; for, as <hi>Diana</hi> does ſurpaſſe <hi>Silvander</hi> in Beauty and Eſtate, ſo the vertue and merits of the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, do equally ballance the Scales: Yet, I do infinitely pitty them both, for I know them moſt abſolute Maſters of themſelves and actions; but now I know by experience, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what a Chaos of confuſion and troubles they are plunged ſo as I muſt needs pitty them, for making ſuch a diſadvantageous change. Thus, wiſe Nymph, we may ſee, that there is no aſſured happineſſes amongſt mortalls. <hi>Celadon,</hi> anſwered the Nymph, you would be <hi>Tautates</hi> himſelfe, if you could perſwade them, that they are not much happier
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:53526:163"/>
then before; nay, <hi>Silvander</hi> himſelfe thinks ſo, whoſe company is much more pleaſant then it was wont to be, as I have heard from thoſe who knew him before. For my part, ſaid <hi>Celadon,</hi> I am of that ſhepheards opinion; for, though there be ſome pains in the life of Love, I pray tell me, in what kinde of life there is not ſo as well? But if you do conſider thoſe contentments which a Lover receives, in loving and being loved, I believe you will agree with me, that there is no happier life then that of Love. Ah <hi>Celadon!</hi> (ſaid the Nymph, with a great ſigh) how dearly are thoſe contentments bought, I refer it unto your own ſelfe, if you would but ingenuouſly confeſſe your paſſion. Every one that loves, replyed <hi>Celadon,</hi> does not meet with <hi>Aſtrea's.</hi> But, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> ſince you are of this opinion, why do you ſay, you pitty them? Becauſe, anſwered <hi>Celadon,</hi> as it is a pleaſing thing to conquer, ſo the contrary, to be conquered; therefore I fear, that there being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of labour and pains to be taken in Love, leſt they ſhould be overcome or aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at the difficulties, and retire, before they have ſurmounted them. And therefore, have I not good reaſon to pitty thoſe, who I ſee do enter into a danger, the iſſue whereof is ſo uncertain? But I do much wonder, how you ſhould know ſo much of <hi>Diana,</hi> whom I know to be alwaies the moſt reſerved and ſecret of all our Shepheardeſſes. The love of <hi>Paris,</hi> anſwered ſhe, is the cauſe of it, who hath made me ſee her ofter then otherwiſe I ſhould. I had a good inclination of my own to go unto your Town, in hopes to finde you there; and when I was thinking upon ſome good excuſe for it, I met with <hi>Paris,</hi> who, that night I returned, ſpoke thus unto me: Siſter, (ſaid he, for <hi>Adamas</hi> would have us call Brother and Siſter) do you remember how much contentment we received that night, we lay in the Town of <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> and how pleaſing their converſation was? I, who knew very well he had been oft there ſince, did anſwer him thus: I do, Brother, ſaid I; but I do believe, you have a better memory then I, and, as I have heard, have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon. It is true, ſaid he unto me; and I cannot deny, but that the merits of thoſe fair and diſcreet Shepheardeſſes, have much invited me to get their friendſhip, and more then I make appear. Brother, ſaid ſhe, you tell me more then I aske. 'Tis no matter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed he, and ſmiled, I will ingenuouſly tell any thing unto you, in hopes, that you will not deny me one requeſt that I ſhall make unto you, and which I do conjure you unto by our friendſhip. Aske what you will Brother, (ſaid I unto him) for I cannot deny you any thing upon that conjuration. I beſeech you then, (ſaid he) that ſince you do not return unto <hi>Marcelles,</hi> you will be pleaſed to walk ſometimes upon the banks of <hi>Lignon,</hi> and paſſe away ſome afternoones in the company of thoſe fair and diſcreet Shepheardeſſes, and give me leave to wait upon you: you will think this place here to be very dull, having been accuſtomed ſo long to the Court; but the banks of <hi>Lignon</hi> have ſhades ſo cool and pleaſant, as it is impoſſible you ſhould be weary: you shall ſee the ſilver ſtreams ſo clear, and ſo filled with all ſorts of fishes, as you will admire; you shall hear all ſorts of Birds make the Woods Eccho, with a thouſand varieties of voices; you shall finde ſuch clear, cool, and curious Fountains, as will invite you to drink of them. To be briefe (ſaid I unto him, and ſmiled) we ſhall meet there the faireſt and ſweeteſt Shepheardeſses in all the Country. 'Tis very true, ſaid he, and I hope all theſe will invite you to go thither. All theſe invitations, ſaid I unto him, do not move me ſo much, as the deſire you have of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither; you are my Brother, and my friend, and under that notion I will fulfill what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you shall deſire: But ſince your deſire is to ſee thoſe Shepheardeſſes, I would gladly know which of them you love beſt, I mean, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> or <hi>Diana.</hi> Siſter, ſaid he, you are growne very inquiſitive of late. I confeſſe it, ſaid I unto him; but if you put me to ask the queſtion twice, I will ſay, you are grown very ſecret of late; for even now, you told me more then I asked. But, Siſter, ſaid he, which of them do you think I may in juſtice addreſſe my ſelfe unto? I underſtand your meaning, ſaid I unto him; you think I will ſay, <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> but, Brother, take heed, leſt <hi>Diana</hi> do not make your deſires devour you. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt unto you, Siſter, ſaid he unto me, I would with all my heart be in danger to be devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by my own Dogs, as <hi>Acteon</hi> was, upon condition, I had the happineſſe to ſee this <hi>Diana</hi> naked Is it poſſible, ſaid I unto him, that you ſhould value your life ſo little? Nay, ſaid he, I eſteem my life at a high rate; but I do eſteem the ſight of ſo much beauty infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely higher, ſince I muſt die, and perhaps ſoon, before I can enjoy any contentment equall unto this; have I not reaſon to venter it betimes, to enjoy ſo high a felicity whilſt I may? For my part, anſwered I, though I think theſe deſires a little too looſe and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant, yet I will not blame you; but I am afraid, they will coſt you much pain and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. I will venter that, ſaid he; but, Siſter, tell me freely, will you, for my ſake, become
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:53526:163"/>
a Shepheardeſſe one houre in the day? How do you mean, (ſaid I unto him) would you have me take the habit of a Shepheardeſſe, as you do of a Shepheard? No, no, ſaid he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, that would be too troubleſome to you, and nothing conducing to my ends; I only deſire you to be with thoſe Shepheardeſses, and let me accompany you. I ſhall do, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what you would have me, ſaid I unto him; but take heed, this way do not prejudice your deſigne; for in ſeeing <hi>Diana,</hi> under colour of keeping me company, ſhe may perhaps think her ſelfe not obliged unto you for your viſit. <hi>Diana,</hi> ſaid he unto me, is not a perſon who inſiſts upon ſuch ceremonious vanities, but is able out of her judgment to diſcern my actions, and diſcerning them, commend my diſcretion.</p>
               <p>This reſolution then was fixed upon amongſt us; and that very night, <hi>Paris</hi> told <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> that if he thought good of it, he would wait upon me the next day a hunting, and that I much deſired it. Whitherſoever ſhe pleaſe, ſaid <hi>Adamas</hi> unto him; for ſuch was my love to her Father, as I can never ſufficiently acquit my ſelfe of it unto his Daughter. This declaration did anſwer the expectation of <hi>Paris,</hi> and therefore the next day, as ſoon as we had dined, we went down the Hill of <hi>Lacquier,</hi> and paſſing over the River <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> at <hi>Trelin</hi> Bridge, we followed the River-ſide, untill we were over againſt <hi>Boutreux,</hi> we left the Temple of the good goddeſſe on the right hand, and came unto a little riſing hill, from whence we might ſee all the turnings and windings of <hi>Lignon,</hi> and the Plaines, where the Shepheards and Shepheardeſſes did drive their Flocks to feed: Then, by a little path, we deſcended into the plain: See, Brother, ſaid I unto him, and pointed with my finger, yonder upon the right hand, is that tuft of Trees, where I firſt ſaw <hi>Aſtrea, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Phillis;</hi> and had you been with me in <hi>Silvia's</hi> room, perhaps we had obſerved more then we did; for, we being weary with walking, we fell aſleep, and in the mean time, theſe three ſhepheardeſſes came, and ſat down cloſe by us, and not ſpying us, doubtleſſe they did not ſit in ſilence; but as ill-fortune was, when we awaked, they were gone. 'Tis true, that ſince I came by my ſelfe, and it was then when you met me, and when I heard all the ſtory of <hi>Diana.</hi> Ah Siſter, (ſaid he up on a ſudden) I remember the time very well; it was then when I began to love another above my ſelfe. But, Siſter, I conjure and beſeech you, by all obligations of friendſhip, to tell me all that you know: Does ſhe love any one? See, ſaid I, and ſmiled, how jealous you are already? What did it concern you, if I knew more? Be contented, that I tell you what I think is requiſite and neceſſary for you to know. Ah cruell Siſter, ſaid he unto me, you uſe me as they do Children, ſhew them an Apple, to make them the more deſire it, and then not give it them. Lovers indeed, ſaid I, are little different from Children. But, Siſter, ſaid he, can you not tell me, whether ſhe loves me or no? It is more to be feared, that ſhe will not love you, (ſaid I unto him) then that ſhe will love any other. Although you threaten me extreamly, ſaid he, yet I am more glad of the aſſurance which you give me, that ſhe loves no other; then I am ſorry for the doubt which you make, that ſhe will not love me. Why, anſwered I, will you not enjoy a good, if another have any ſhare with you? Before I can give you a full anſwer, ſaid <hi>Paris,</hi> I muſt make a long diſtinction of Goods; but I will briefly tell you, that there are ſome, which the more communicable they are, the better they are; and others, which are more to be eſteemed, the leſſe they are communicable: and in this laſt order, muſt I rank the Goods of Love. I think, anſwered I, that if I were in a capacity of loving, I ſhould be of the ſame beliefe. But, let not this fear diminiſh the favours you receive; for you may be moſt certainly aſſured, that thoſe favoure you receive from her, (if ever you arrive at that Good) they will not be common.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Celadon,</hi> I have made this long diſcourſe unto you, to the end you may judge, how deeply <hi>Paris</hi> is in Love. Now I ſhall tell you ſomething concerning <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Lycidas.</hi> Walking thus down into the Plain, we eſpied <hi>Silvander,</hi> who ſitting under a Tree, was ſo intent unto the Muſick of his Bag-pipe, as he took no notice how <hi>Diana,</hi> knowing his voice, ſtole gently behinde a Buſh to hear him, and not be ſeen; and <hi>Diana</hi> was ſo deſirous to hear, that ſhe did not ſee <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> who ſeeing her, and having the ſame curioſity, did ſteal on the other ſide, unſeen either by <hi>Diana</hi> or <hi>Silvander;</hi> but we were moſt pleaſed at <hi>Lycidas,</hi> who being upon a little Hill, looked upon <hi>Phillis,</hi> as ſhe crept gently upon the ground, leſt <hi>Silvander</hi> ſhould ſee her; for having an opinion, that the love which ſhe bare unto that Shepheard, was the cauſe of her deſire to hear him, he ſtood with croſſed armes, and eyes ſo fixed upon her, as if he were a Statue; I had not known him at that diſtance, but for <hi>Paris,</hi> who ſaw him often. Now as we were walking down the Hill, we ſaw your Brother pul down his Hat upon a ſudden, and turning his
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:53526:164"/>
back upon his Shepheardeſs, he came ſtamping towards us, and never ſaw us; but ſtill as he went, ſcratched his head, ſtamped upon the ground, ſtruck himſelfe upon the breaſt, and lifted his eyes often up to heaven. Theſe paſſionate actions made us very deſirous to hear what he ſaid, and therefore hiding our ſelves behinde a great Buſh which was by the way ſide, we took notice, that upon a ſuddian he fell down, as if he had been troubled with a fit of the falling ſickneſs: We ſtole neerer and neerer unto him, untill we could hear him ſigh out a hundred ſymptomes of jealouſie, ſaying, That he had all the reaſon in the world to be jealous, and that all oaths, and former aſſurances of affection, ſhould never perſwade him to the contrary; but that he was jealous with judgment, ſince he ſaw <hi>Phillis</hi> upon her knees before him ſhe loved. Then after a hundred ſuch expreſſions, we ſaw him riſe up, and look backward, to ſee what <hi>Phillis</hi> did, and a little after, went neerer her, then returned again to the place from whence he came. He did not perceive us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was ſo totally taken up with his thoughts of <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſo as I think, if we had ſtood directly before his eyes, he could not have ſeen us. We followed him; and when he had couched himſelfe cloſe by <hi>Phillis,</hi> we couched behinde him, and heard <hi>Silvander</hi> ſing theſe Verſes.</p>

Is it not thy cuſtome, (Oh thou little god) to nouriſh hopes in many, whom thou never meaneſt to content, and why does thy cuſtome faile in me?

This Shepheard perhaps had continued longer, if <hi>Driope, Diana</hi>'s Dog, had not broke looſe from her, and run fawning upon <hi>Silvander,</hi> for he was wont to make very much of him for his Miſtreſse's ſake. The Shepheard preſently roſe up, and looked round about, but could not ſee her; yet, he ſaw <hi>Lycidas</hi> hearkening, and <hi>Phillis,</hi> who ſeeing him riſe, went to him, as <hi>Diana</hi> deſired; but as ſhe went towards him, ſhe eſpied <hi>Lycidas,</hi> which made her change her intention; for ſhe knowing, that he was jealous of <hi>Silvander,</hi> ſhe turned another way: and this made <hi>Lycidas</hi> the more ſuſpect her, thinking ſhe did it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to hide it from him. <hi>Silvander,</hi> who knew both their hearts, and being reſolved to augment the jealouſie of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> he faigned, as if he did not ſee <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and ran unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> and taking her hand, did imprint two or three zealous kiſſes upon it; afterwards asked her, how <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> did? The Shepheardeſs was very ſorry that <hi>Lycidas</hi> did ſee all this, and ſo perplexed at it, as ſhe knew not how to anſwer him. <hi>Paris</hi> and I, who intended to follow <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> we now went unto <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Phillis. Lycidas,</hi> extreamly ill ſatisfyed with all this, turned another way, as if he had never ſeen us. We foure being together, we went that way <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> went, after <hi>Silvander</hi> had taken order, both for his ownflock, and that of <hi>Phillis</hi>'s. This was a ſore heart-burn unto <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and his jealouſie was much more increaſed by it, when he ſaw that Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard ſo carefull about the flock of <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſo as your Brother was continually turning his head towards us, to ſee what we did.</p>
               <p>I profeſs (ſaid <hi>Celadon,</hi> and interrupted her) he is much to be pittyed; for I have found, by my little experience of it, that jealouſie is one of the moſt extream fortunes of a Lover. But, fair Nymph, what became of him afterwards? I cannot tell, anſwered ſhe, for I ſaw him not all the day after: and as for us, we went unto <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> who, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſtayed for our company: and we ſpent all that day together with much contentment: <hi>Paris,</hi> he applyed himſelfe unto <hi>Diana; Silvander,</hi> unto <hi>Phillis;</hi> and I unto <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> whom indeed I finde to be moſt worthy of <hi>Celadon</hi>'s affection. Fair Nymph, ſaid <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> I beſeech you give me leave to be a little more inquiſitive. What is it, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> that you deſire to know of me? Did you ever hear, ſaid <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſo ſweet a voice as hers? has ſhe not a kinde of an harmonious accent in her pronunciation, which charmes the ear? Certainly ſhe has, ſaid the Nymph, and that which moſt takes me, is, that ſhe uſeth no art or affection in her language, but all her expreſſions are plain, and full of modeſty and civility. But I beſeech you, ſweet Nymph ſaid <hi>Celadon,</hi> did ſhe never ſpeak of me? She did, ſaid I, but it was my ſelfe who began the diſcourſe; for I knew, the reaſon why ſhe ſpoke ſo little of you, was, the opinion which every one had of your affection to her. For heavens ſake, ſweet <hi>Leonida,</hi> (ſaid the ſhepheard) tell me what diſcourſe you had together? It was not much, (ſaid ſhe unto him) yet I know not whether I ſhall remember it or no: I was very deſirous to hear what was become of you; and when <hi>Paris</hi> deſired me to go unto your Town, I had not the confidence to ſpeak of you: And when I ſaw <hi>Paris</hi> ſo deeply in love with <hi>Diana,</hi> as he minded nothing but her, and not finding you amongſt the ſhepheardeſſes, I was extreamly troubled. At laſt, after ſome other diſcourſe, I told her, how I did not think, that the ſhepheards of <hi>Lignon</hi> had been ſo civilized as I found them: The firſt time I ſtayed with them, was purpoſely to ſee, whether the reports I had heard were true; and <hi>Silvander</hi> that day confirmed them all. I muſt confeſſe, (anſwered <hi>Aſtrea)</hi> that <hi>Silvander</hi> is a very well accompliſhed ſhepheard. But, Madam, had you come at another time, I believe you would have found better ſatisfaction; for there was a time, when we had a moſt excellent company of ſhepheards. What is become of them, anſwered I? Some, ſaid ſhe, are dead, as the poor <hi>Celadon;</hi> others are ſo grieved for the loſſe of him, as they are grown ſo many lumps of melancholly, and frequent none, but ſolitary places, as <hi>Lycidas;</hi> and ſome are ſo aſtoniſhed at the accident, as they have quite left the fatall <hi>Lignon:</hi> and indeed, we are all ſo ſad ever ſince, as we do not ſeem the ſame we were. <hi>Celadon,</hi> replyed I, was not that he whom I heard talk off, when I was laſt here? The ſame, (ſaid ſhe unto me, with a deep ſigh) Was he your Cozen (ſaid I unto her)? No, anſwered ſhe, but on the contrary, his Father and mine were moſt mortall enemies: But, Madam, he was the moſt gentle and fineſt ſhepheard in all the Country; and though there was a moſt deadly enmity between our two families, yet his ſweet and good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions conſtrained me, and every one that knew him, to reſent his loſſe. At this ſhe chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged colour and putting her hand before her eyes, ſhe ſeemed as if the rubbed her forehead. I perceived by this diſcourſe, that you were not yet returned unto her, ſince I left you; and knowing, that ſhe could not tell me any thing, that could ſatisfie my longing deſires
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:53526:165"/>
of ſeeing you, and that ſuch talk would only grieve her, I changed diſcourſe; and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, it being late, <hi>Paris</hi> and I retired. It was then I heard from <hi>Silvander</hi> of your Brother's jealouſie; for walking by the River ſide, I asked him the cauſe of your Brother's ſadneſſe, and why we could never ſee him? And he told me, that <hi>Lycidas</hi> being a devoted ſervant unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> he was jealous of her and him; and that he, to torment him the more, did ſeem as if he were in love with <hi>Phillis,</hi> and gave out all the demonſtrations of it that poſſibly he could. Thus, <hi>Celadon,</hi> did we ſpend that day; and ſince that, becauſe I could not hear any newes of you, I viſited this Company every day, thinking, that being in the company of thoſe whom you loved, I was in ſome ſort with you. This was the reaſon, that when <hi>Amaſis,</hi> after great preparations of joy, was conſtrained to leave them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the newes of <hi>Merovea</hi>'s death, though <hi>Silvia,</hi> by the command of <hi>Galathea,</hi> did let me know, that I might return unto <hi>Marcelles</hi> when I would, yet I would not go, becauſe I took abundance of delight in the ſociety of theſe diſcreet ſhepheardeſſes. Why (ſaid <hi>Celadon)</hi> did <hi>Amaſis</hi> grieve ſo, for the death of that King? Becauſe (as I believe) <hi>Clidamant</hi> was with him, (anſwered I). Now, leſt my Uncle ſhould make me return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Nymph, I did conceal <hi>Silvia's</hi> Letter from him. But, <hi>Celadon,</hi> tell me truly, do you not envie me, for ſeeing <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and ſpeaking with her as oft as I would? I ſhall not be ſorry at any thing that pleaſeth you, anſwered he; but I could wiſh my ſelfe a ſhare in the happineſſe. And why (anſwered the Nymph) do you deprive your ſelfe of it? Ah <hi>Leonida!</hi> (ſaid he) could you but look into my heart, you would ſee I do not; but I can take no delight in ſeeing her, and in ſeeing her diſpleaſed. But why (ſaid the Nymph) do you think ſhe will be diſpleaſed with ſeeing you? Becauſe (anſwered the ſhepheard) ſhe hath commanded me never to ſee her, untill ſhe command otherwiſe. How can ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand otherwiſe (ſaid <hi>Leonida)</hi> if ſhe never ſee you, nor knowes where you are, but thinks you to be dead? Ah Nymph, (ſaid the ſhepheard) Love is a moſt puiſſant god; and as he has blindely found out a way to baniſh me her preſence, he may alſo finde a way to recall me when he pleaſeth. Are you then reſolved (ſaid <hi>Leonida)</hi> not to preſent your ſelfe before her? I had rather die, anſwered he, and therefore let Love do as it liſts. Upon this, he aroſe, purpoſely to change diſcourſe, and taking the Nymphs hand, he came to the dore of his Cave; but when ſhe ſaw him in the light, and perceiving him ſo extreamly altered, ſhe could not reſtrain her tears; which <hi>Celadon</hi> ſeeing: Nay, nay, ſweet Nymph, ſaid he, never grieve at the alteration which you finde in my face, for it is a ſigne, that ere long I ſhall have a long reſt. It would be too tedious to relate all their diſcourſe. But, to be briefe, all her arguments and perſwaſions could obtain from him no more, then this, that he would ſuffer her to viſit him ſometimes. At the laſt, the Sun being almoſt ſet, ſhe was conſtrained to leave him, with a promiſe to ſee him very often.</p>
               <p>For all <hi>Leonida's</hi> reſolution, of not loving <hi>Celadon,</hi> yet could ſhe not extinguiſh the flames of her firſt affection to him; ſo difficult a thing it is to expell this paſſion, when it has once taken deep root in a heart which entertains it; and therefore this meeting with him was no ſmall contentment unto her; but her ſorrowes, to ſee him in ſuch a miſerable condition, were as great, and the greater, when ſhe thought upon his ſtrange reſolution; ſo as her joyes to finde him, and her ſorrowes to finde him thus, did a little puzzle her which to adhere moſt unto: All the way ſhe went, ſhe was inventing what courſe ſhe ſhould take, to diſſwade him from this courſe of life: Sometimes ſhe was in a minde, to acquaint the ſhepheardeſſe <hi>Aſtrea</hi> with it, in hopes, that her influence might effect it. But this minde changed, as ſoon as ſhe conſidered, that this was the way to put her ſelfe out of all hopes to get his love, knowing very well, that if <hi>Aſtrea</hi> once knew he was alive, and could finde him, ſhe would give him ſuch ſweet demonſtrations of her good-will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, as would blaſt all her hopes of him. Changing therefore this opinion, and having heard, that <hi>Adamas</hi> had been a great lover of <hi>Celadon's</hi> Father, ſhe thought it expedient to acquaint him with his courſe of life, aſſuring her ſelfe, that he would do all that was requiſite and fit. Yet notwithſtanding, when ſhe conſidered, that the place where <hi>Celadon</hi> was, was as fit a place as ſhe could wiſh, to enjoy his company alone, and to expreſſe her own paſſion, ſhe conceived the beſt way was, to acquaint none as yet, but to try what time would doe, and to divert him from his ſad thoughts as much as ſhe poſſibly could; and if ſhe found, that her preſence and artifice could not work upon him, then it would be time enough to acquaint her Uncle. This then was the courſe ſhe fixed upon; and to effect it, ſhe failed not to viſit him every day. The ſhepheard knowing, that all this could not proceed from any thing but love, he was diſpleaſed at it, thinking, that if he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:53526:166"/>
ſo much indulgency from this Nymph, he did offend againſt the promiſe of fidelity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſhepheardeſſe: Beſides, he thought all thoſe houres that were ſpent in theſe viſits, were loſt, becauſe they kept him from entertaining his own dear and ſweet thoughts; ſo as in lieu of growing more joyfull, he became more ſad; which the Nymph perceiving, and ſeeing that he did every day grow leaner and paler; ſhe conſulted with her ſelfe, and at laſt reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to have recourſe unto the ſage advice of the grave <hi>Adamas;</hi> but to acquaint him with it in ſuch a manner, as he ſhould be ſure not to ſuſpect any thing, to her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage.</p>
               <p>Being therefore one evening in a better humour then ordinary, ſhe went unto her Uncle, whom ſhe found walking upon a Tarraſſe, which had the proſpect of all that plain from whence ſhe came: After ſalutation, the Druide asked her, where ſhe left <hi>Paris?</hi> To which ſhe anſwered, that all the ſhepheardeſſes were ſo kinde and civill, as to accompany them as far as the Temple of the good goddeſſe, and <hi>Paris</hi> went to conduct them back again: But, Father, ſaid ſhe, I have met with a fine encounter, which ſtayed me ſo long, that I thought <hi>Paris</hi> would have been back before me. What is it ſaid the Druide? It is <hi>Celadon,</hi> anſwered <hi>Leonida;</hi> you muſt know, that ſince he went from the Palace of <hi>Iſſaures,</hi> in lieu of going to his kindred and friends, he has retired himſelf into a Cave, where he ſo hides himſelf from all his acquaintance, as every one yet thinks him dead. Why, ſaid <hi>Adamas,</hi> does he ſo? I believe, anſwered ſh, that he is very ſick in minde, and will not live long, for he can ſcarcely go; he eats nothing but graſſe, and is grown ſo lean and ſad, as you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know him. Why, think you, ſaid the Druide, that it is in his minde? I conceive ſo, ſaid ſhe, becauſe he ſpeaks after an interrupted manner, and ſo little, as it is eaſie to ſee, that diſcourſe diſpleaſeth him; I do believe, the love he bears unto <hi>Aſtrea</hi> is the cauſe of it. If it be ſo, anſwered <hi>Adamas,</hi> he is the more like unto his Father; for, <hi>Alcippe</hi> was once ſo very much tranſported with his love unto <hi>Amarillis,</hi> that I did never in all my life ſee one commit greater follies; and therefore it was, that he left a Country-life for the Court, and continued long in the exerciſes of Chivalry. Is it lawfull for them, ſaid <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onida,</hi> thus to change their quality? Child, ſaid the Druide, neither <hi>Celadon</hi> nor any of theſe ſhepheards about the banks of <hi>Lignon,</hi> nor moſt of thoſe about the <hi>Loire</hi> and <hi>Furan,</hi>
are of a worſe extraction then you your ſelfe are; you muſt know, that their Anceſtours made choice of this kinde of life, as moſt ſweet, and leaſt ſubject unto inquietudes. Indeed, this <hi>Celadon,</hi> of whom you ſpeak, is your neer kinſman: For, the Houſe of <hi>Laigneau</hi> and his, did branch both out of one ſtock, ſo as <hi>Lindamor</hi> and he are your Coſens in the ſame degree: My Grandfather, and the great Grandfather of <hi>Lindamor</hi> and <hi>Celadon,</hi> were Brothers. <hi>Leonida</hi> hearing how neerly they were allied, was aſtoniſhed, fearing leſt this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity ſhould forbid the banes of her loving him, as Love commanded her to do; yet, leſt her Uncle ſhould take any notice of her fears, ſhe ſaid unto him; That ſince they were ſo neerly allyed, they were the more obliged to have a care of him, and that the ſavage life he led was ſuch, as ſhe verily believed he could not live long. It is very fit, ſaid the Druide, that we have all the care of him that poſſibly we can; and therefore, to ſhew my indulgency towards him, I will go unto the Cave of the old <hi>Cleontine,</hi> and conſult with her about him: Perhaps the heavens have a care of him, and keep him thus hid, to prevent ſome great misfortune; for I have known ſome others, that have been ſo preſerved from divers blaſts of malignant fate, which did threaten them. Whilſt they were thus talking, <hi>Paris</hi> came in, and interrupted them, for they would not acquaint him with it, ſo as <hi>Adamas</hi> and <hi>Leonida</hi> went betimes to bed, that they might be the more early up in the morning, to go unto <hi>Cleontine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mount <hi>Verdun</hi> is a great Rock, reſembling a pointed Diamond, which ſtands in the midſt of the plain towards Mount <hi>Briſon,</hi> between the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> and the Mountain <hi>Iſſaures;</hi> were it a little more upon the right hand towards <hi>Laigneau,</hi> then <hi>Marcelles, Iſſaures,</hi> and Mount <hi>Verdun,</hi> did make a perfect Triangle. It ſeemes Nature took delight in imbelliſhing this place above all others in the Country; for, it being elevated in the very heart of this Plain, ſo equally on all ſides, it raiſed it ſelfe by ſuch eeven degrees, and at the top did leave juſt room for a Temple, which was dedicated unto <hi>Tautates, Heſius, Tharames,</hi> and <hi>Belinus;</hi> and being the moſt famous in all the <hi>Forreſts,</hi> it is here where the <hi>Lubages,</hi> the <hi>Sarronides,</hi> the <hi>Vaces,</hi> and the <hi>Bardes,</hi> do dwell in <hi>Grattoes,</hi> which they have made about the Temple, in which they aſſemble themſelves when the Druides com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them. But that which is moſt admirable, is, that this great Rock, which is above foure thouſand paces about, when it begins to riſe from the levell, and above foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:53526:166"/>
paces high, and at the top above five hundred paces broad; yet, it is ſo covered with earth, planted with Vines, ſo full of graſſe, and ſo green, that thoſe of the Country cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting its name, do call it Mount <hi>Verdun,</hi> or green Mountain, in lieu of Mount <hi>Vatodun,</hi> which ſignifies the Mountain and dwelling of Prieſts or Sacrifices; for in the language of the <hi>Celts, Dunum</hi> ſignifies Fortreſſe; and <hi>Vates,</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> language, ſignifies Prieſts, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, or ſuch as give Oracles; and ſince the <hi>Gaules</hi> had any communication with the <hi>Romans,</hi> they have not only mixed their language, but alſo their manner of ſacrificing, complying themſelves with a victorious people, ſo made ſuch a miſcellany, as they do retain unto themſelves equally halfe <hi>Roman,</hi> halfe <hi>Celt.</hi> This Mountain became thus peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with <hi>Bardes, Eubages, Surronides,</hi> and others, by <hi>Dryus,</hi> the firſt Inſtitutor of the Druides, who inſpired this place with a certain kinde of divinity, and left a mark of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Poſterity. This Rock, which, for its magnitude, may well be called a Mountain, is naturally ſo hollow, as within it is but one vaſt Vault; it hath three entrances, ſo ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, that a Coach may enter; they are commonly kept ſhut, and opened only when the Oracle is to be conſulted with, and then a Druide, after a ſacrifice, opens the dore, and askes the queſtion: Preſently there iſſues an impetuous winde, which comming from the concavities of this Vault, makes a ſtrange confuſed noiſe, ſeeming to be a kinde of ill pronounced voice. The Druide holding his head as far in as he can, ſtayes there, with his mouth open as long as the noiſe continues; afterwards comes away, with his hair diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, his eyes ſtaring, his face changed, and voice altered from what they were, and with actions, as if tranſported, does give the Oracle, which very often, the pronouncer her ſelfe does not underſtand.</p>
               <p>Now theſe three entrances, are dedicated unto three of their gods, or indeed, unto one god under three ſeverall names; the one unto <hi>Heſius,</hi> whom they conſult with in matters of War; the other unto <hi>Thamaris,</hi> when future events would be known; and the other unto <hi>Belinus,</hi> unto whom all Lovers do addreſſe their ſacrifices and ſupplications. And theſe three entrances are never all open at a time, but upon the ſixteenth day of <hi>July,</hi> when having gathered abundance of <hi>Miſleto,</hi> they come and ſtrew it all about the Vault. At this time, if the Soveraigne Lady of the Province have a Daughter, ſhe may enter, and make choice of him whom ſhe will have for her Husband; with whom, and the grand Druide, they may view all that is in this Cave, and ſee all the wonders which the great Druide left in it.</p>
               <p>This was the place unto which <hi>Adamas</hi> with <hi>Leonida</hi> did reſort in the morning, to conſult with <hi>Thamaris;</hi> and after the ſacrifice of a white Bull, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, and after <hi>Cleontine</hi> had dreſſed her ſelfe in <hi>Vervin,</hi> and ſprinkled the blood of the ſacrifice at the entrance, ſhe put a piece of Lawrell in her mouth and chewed it; then touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dore with a branch of <hi>Miſleto,</hi> preſently it opens with a great noiſe, and ſhe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hold of the hinges, leanes all her body in, and opening her mouth to receive the winde which comes out of the Cave, ſhe ſtayes there a good while, and at laſt, comes unto the place of ſacrifice, where the Druide and all the reſt do ſtay upon their knees, and bare-headed, praying unto <hi>Tentates.</hi> When ſhe is come back, ſhe goes unto the Altar, and there, with an afrighted viſage, and hair ſtaring, with a ſtrange hoarſe voice, ſhe uttered theſe words.</p>

                  <hi>Adamas,</hi> after thanks unto <hi>Thamaris,</hi> and beſeeching him to make him underſtand his will, leſt by ignorance he ſhould erre, he went away, fully reſolved to aſſiſt <hi>Celadon</hi> all that poſſibly he could, ſince the gods did promiſe to make his age happy, if he obtained his Miſtreſſe. He had before a very good inclination towards him, as well becauſe of the neer conſanguinity betwixt them, as becauſe of that ſhepheards merits; but much more,

ſince this anſwer from the Oracle, evidencing hereby, that a perſon intereſted, is much more ſolicitous in any buſineſſe, then one that is only obliged by duty. Taking the way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore towards <hi>Lignon,</hi> he asked <hi>Leonida,</hi> where <hi>Celadon</hi>'s habitation was? And ſhe ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the way, they came at laſt to the buſh which covered the entrance into the Cave, where he took up his habitation; and fearing, leſt if he ſaw them, he ſhould flie them, they went as ſoftly as they could to ſurprize him. As fortune was, he lay juſt at the entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Cave, ſo near the River, that as he leaned upon a hillock, and ſaw his tears drop into the River, they heard him utter theſe words.</p>

               <p>Ah! River, River continued he, thou that art a witneſſe, how I am now the moſt miſerable, as formerly I was the moſt happy, ſhepheard in the world, why waſt thou ſo mercileſſe, as to ſave my miſerable life when it was in thy power to put an end unto all my ſorrowes, by taking this pittifull life away? Will things that are inſenſible conſpire againſt me, and deny me that, which naturally they beſtow upon others? But perhaps thou art loth to loſe thy third ſcource, knowing that my tears did more abundantly ſwell thy Chanell, then both thoſe from whence thou haſt thy originall: If this was the motive that moved thee unto this cruell pitty, I'le aſſure thee, thou art not deceived ſince as long as I live, my tears ſhall never fail thee. Upon this laſt word, a moſt profound ſigh gave a ſtop unto his voice, ſo as for a while his tongue was ſilent; and as he was beginning again, <hi>Leonida</hi> unawares ſtirred. He turning his head that way, he was extreamly ſurpriſed, to ſee <hi>Adamas</hi> with her in that place; he preſently aroſe, and came to ſalute the Druide, who advanced towards him. The thin and pale looks of <hi>Celadon</hi> did not a little aſtoniſh <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</hi> And having former experience of the force of Love, he conceived, that this violent malady might reduce him unto a more dangerous condition, if no remedies were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. Therefore after common ſaluations and diſcourſe, he took him by the hand and cauſed him to ſit down and then began this diſcourſe unto him: Son, what a ſtrange condition is this, in which I finde you? Was it to live thus, that you requeſted me to help you out of the pain that you were in, within the Palace of <hi>Iſsaures?</hi> Did you intend to ſhut your ſelfe up in this Cave, and live like a ſalvage from the ſociety of men? You are born, <hi>Celadon,</hi> unto a better fate, the great <hi>Thamaris</hi> tells me as much; he has beſtowed upon you great Flocks, and large Paſtures; and do you think your ſelfe not obliged to render an account of them? All under the cope of heaven is his, we are all but his Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, and queſtionleſſe he will exact a particular accompt; and, Soh, when that time
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:53526:167"/>
comes, what will you then anſwer? Although he hath ſubmitted theſe things unto our wills; yet, our very wills are not our own, and we may expect a ſevere puniſhment, if we diſpoſe of our ſelves otherwiſe than as we ought. How can you think it reaſonable to live without any care of Flocks, or Friends, or Kindred, or Men? Dare you contemn thoſe remedies, which that great god hath upon this occaſion put into your hands? Perhaps you will ſay, that your affection unto the ſhepheardeſſe <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> does force you unto it. But, Son, conſider well with your ſelfe, that if you have offended her, all your ſervices cannot wipe away the offence, as long as you keep at diſtance from her; and if you have not offended her, how can you ever hope or think ſhe ſhould know your innocency, if ſhe never ſee or hear of you? Now, my Son, I do grant, that for the time paſt, you had ſome reaſon to abſent your ſelfe from her preſence, nay, from all the world, to the end ſhe may ſee, what power ſhe hath over you, and that you value the loſſe of her favour as the loſſe of your reaſon. But now that time is expired, you muſt now return unto your ſelfe again, and make it appear, that you are both in Love, and that you are a man. Though your ſorrowes may deprive you of your reaſon, yet, now reaſon ought to revive, that ſhe may not repent of having a Servant who is not a Man. Unto this <hi>Celadon</hi> returned this cold anſwer: I would to god, Father, that your ſapient advice were addreſſed unto one capable to receive it; as for me, I muſt confeſſe, there remaines nothing of a man in me but my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, having loſt both my underſtanding and my will; and I believe, this memory that remains with me, is only as a nouriſhment of my ſad thoughts; ſo as he whom you now ſee before you, is not <hi>Celadon</hi> the Son of <hi>Alcippes</hi> and <hi>Amarillis,</hi> whom the great Druide <hi>Adamas</hi> heretofore did honour with his friendſhip; but he is only one, that the heavens conſerves here amongſt the Woods, as a teſtimony, that <hi>Celadon</hi> knowes how to love. In anſwer unto all you object, let this ſerve for all, <hi>I love:</hi> For, ſage <hi>Adamas,</hi> if I do love, I need not fear, that <hi>Tharamis</hi> will be offended at me, for doing that which Love com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, ſince he would have me, or at leaſt permits me, to love. Now thoſe who do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a thing, they permit all that depends upon it; and who can deny, but that this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable life which I lead, is a dependency of this love? Can he be called a Lover, who has eyes that will look upon any thing but that he Loves? Ah! Father, doubtleſſe I do love, and I am blinde unto all Flocks, and Friends, and Kindred, and all Men living. If the heavens, as you ſay, have given me any thing, why ſhould it exact an account of me, ſince I do reſigne them back again as freely, as ever they were beſtowed upon me? If any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count be required of <hi>Celadon,</hi> it muſt be required of her whoſe <hi>Celadon</hi> is; as for me, I have nothing to account of, for I have reſigned all, the heavens would have it ſo, for it is by deſtiny that I do love, and the heavens do know it: As ſoon as ever I had any will, I gave my ſelf wholly unto her, and have continued ſo ever ſince. To be briefe, the heavens are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with it, otherwiſe I had not been ſo happy as I was many years. If therefore the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens would have it ſo, do know it, and were pleaſed with it; how can they in juſtice pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh me, for doing that, which I cannot chuſe but do? Do what thou wilt with me, Oh great <hi>Thamaris</hi> let what will become of my flocks, let my Friends and Kindred have what opinion of me they pleaſe; they all ought to be ſatisfied with this anſwer, that, <hi>I do love.</hi> But, anſwered <hi>Adamas,</hi> will you alwaies live thus? The election (anſwered the ſhepheard) does not depend upon him, that hath neither will nor underſtanding.</p>
               <p>If you do, (ſaid <hi>Adamas)</hi> you will ceaſe to be a man. That (replyed the ſhepheard) has been a long time the leaſt of my cares. But, if you do love, ſaid the Druide, why do you not enforce your ſelfe to ſee her whom you love? If I do love, anſwered he, do you think I will diſpleaſe or diſobey her whom I love; nay, do you think, that I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive extream contentment and delight in pleaſing and obeying her? But, ſaid the Druide, ſhe does not know that you do obey her. It is no matter, anſwered he, whether ſhe do or no, I muſt do my duty. The Druide knew not whether he ſhould eſteem him for the acuteneſſe of his wit in theſe anſwers, or blame him, for the errours he was in: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, that his malady was not yet at the height, therefore he would not apply any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent remedies, untill he had tryed ſome more milder; and therefore, after a while of ſilence, he ſaid thus unto him: Now, <hi>Celadon,</hi> what I have ſaid, was, becauſe I thought my ſelfe obliged unto it by the Lawes of friendſhip, and duty of my charge, and not to contrary you in any thing; only one favour I ſhall deſire from you, which I hope you will not deny, ſince it will conduce much unto my contentment: You muſt know, that I have a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whom I love above all the bleſſings, which the goodneſſe of <hi>Tharamis</hi> hath beſtowed upon me; I have long wanted my greateſt contentment, in wanting her, and I am afraid,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:53526:168"/>
it will be longer before I ſhall ſee her again. Now the firſt time I ſaw you at the Palace of <hi>Iſsoures,</hi> 'tis true, I loved you for <hi>Alcippe</hi>'s and <hi>Amarillis</hi>'s ſake, but much more, for your great reſemblance of my deareſt Daughter; therefore I conjure you, by her that hath moſt power over you, to be pleaſed, that I may ſometimes interrupt your ſolitude, that I may in your face ſee the Picture of her, whom I love above all the world. The ſhepheard, who was full of courteſy, anſwered, That he would take it for a very particular favour, if he would be pleaſed to take the paines; and that he thanked Nature for favouring him ſo much, as to give him a reſemblance of any he loved; and that if he had not excluded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from all the world, he would come to his houſe and preſent him his ſervice. To be briefe, <hi>Adamas</hi> reſolved to viſit this ſhepheard very often, hoping by degrees to draw him out of his melancholly Cell. True it was, that <hi>Alexis</hi> his Daughter had a little reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of this ſhepheard; and ſhe being by their Lawes to ſtay amongſt the Druides Daughters, in the Cells of <hi>Carnutes,</hi> untill ſhe was forty years of age, <hi>Adamas</hi> did take delight in ſeeing <hi>Celadon,</hi> who had a kinde of reſemblance of her. It had been ordained by <hi>Dis Samothes,</hi> and ſince confirmed by great <hi>Druis,</hi> the firſt Inſtitutor of the Druides, that thoſe Prieſts which had any Sons, ſhould ſend the eldeſt of them unto the Schooles of <hi>Carnutes,</hi> where they ſpent ten years in learning their Science, ten years more in teaching others; and ten years more yet, they officiated in the publick Sacrifices and Judgments: and afterwards they might return to their homes, and exerciſe the charge of Druides throughout all <hi>Gaul.</hi> If they have none but Daughters, they are conſtrained to ſend their eldeſt, after ten years of age, unto the ſame place; where they are inſtructed, do inſtruct, and at laſt, judge, as I told you before. For, the <hi>Gaules</hi> do build very much upon the judgment of theſe Female Druides: And theſe times being expired, they may return to their Fathers, and may marry.</p>
               <p>Now this courſe being reſolved upon, <hi>Celadon</hi> was he that reaped the moſt profit by it; for <hi>Leonida</hi> did at the firſt reſtore unto him thoſe Letters, which ſhe ſtole from him, which was a good preſage of better fortune, having often heard ſay, that as one misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſeldome comes alone, ſo alſo one good fortune drawes on another. And he being very often viſited, ſometimes by <hi>Leonida,</hi> and ſometimes by the Druide, he was much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from thoſe ſad thoughts, which would quite have conſumed him; beſides, the care of <hi>Adamas</hi> was ſuch, as he ſent him victualls very often ſecretly, which much revived his drooping ſpirits.</p>
               <p>The affection of this Nymph, and the goodneſſe of <hi>Adamas,</hi> was a happy encounter for <hi>Celadon,</hi> for both of them were carefull of him beyond meaſure, and indeed beyond their duty and quality; but, the greateſt comfort unto this ſhepheard, was, that this Nymph furniſhed him with Pen, Inke, and Paper, becauſe being alone, he did employ himſelfe much in putting his paſſionate thoughts into writing, which gave him much contentment in the reading them. For, the wounds of Love are of ſuch a nature, that the more they are ſmothered and kept in, the more they feſter; and talking of them is as ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne a remedy, as can be received in abſence. Now <hi>Adamas</hi> conceived, that too much thinking did but feſter and rancle the melancholly of this ſhepheard, and therefore he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to paſſe away his time, ſometimes in the ſacred Groves, which were neer, and there engrave ſome fancies upon the barks of Trees, and furniſhed him with tooles fit for the purpoſe. This Shepheard having gotten a little more ſtrength, and recovered ſome of his former complexion, alſo reaſſuming his underſtanding facultle, he was ſenſible of this good counſell which <hi>Adamas</hi> gave him, to ſhun this careleſſe and idle kinde of life wherein he lived; and therefore he took his advice, and fell to work. <hi>Adamas</hi> in this did, like a good Phyſitian, conſider the diſeaſe which he was to cure, and there ſeaſoned all his counſells with ſome deſignes of Love. You ſee, Son, ſaid he unto him, that though according to our Statutes, we ought not to erect Temples unto <hi>Teutates, Heſius, Belinus,</hi> and <hi>Tharamis</hi> our god; yet, ſince the <hi>Romans,</hi> by their Armes, brought in ſtrange gods unto <hi>Gaul,</hi> and loſing our antient freedome, we were conſtrained to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice after their faſhion, we have Temples, in which our god is adored amongſt us; and becauſe the cuſtome of it is become a Law, it is lawfull for you, <hi>Celadon,</hi> to dedicate part of this Grove, not only unto the higheſt and prime divinity, but as a moſt perfect work of that divinity, unto your fair <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> which our great god will as well allow, as thoſe Temples that are dedicated by ſtrangers, unto the goddeſſe <hi>Fortune,</hi> unto the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> or the goddeſſe <hi>Fear.</hi> Therefore, ſaid he unto him, let me adviſe you to prime and dreſſe up this goodly Oake, to cut away the thick underwood, and make a
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:53526:168"/>
place, which we will dedicate unto <hi>Amity.</hi> At the root of the Oake, caſt up a bank of graſs, in form of an Altar, upon which I will ſet a Table, which ſhall be an emblem of <hi>Amity.</hi> When this is finiſhed, we will make another more ſpacious, which ſhall be under that Oak, which truly is one moſt admirable; for out of one ſtock three branches do grow, and afterwards reunite themſelves into the ſame bark.</p>
               <p>You ſee, (ſaid he unto him) that this is a moſt lively ſymbol of <hi>Teutates, Heſius, Belinus,</hi> and <hi>Tharamis</hi> our god. How, Father (ſaid <hi>Celadon)</hi> you name foure, and yet you ſay, our god? you ſhould have ſaid, gods; and I have obſerved, that you have uſed the ſame expreſſion more then once. Son (ſaid the Druide) this is one of our greateſt myſteries in divinity; and though we Druides ought not to reveal it unto any, but ſuch as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in our Schooles, yet I ſhall declare unto you as much, as you are capable to underſtand.</p>
               <p>Know therefore, my Son, that the great <hi>Dis, Samothes,</hi> preſently after the diviſion of men, by reaſon of the confuſion of Languages, being well inſtructed by his Grandfather, both in the worſhip of the true God, and in other Sciences, he came by the <hi>Armorick</hi> Sea into this Country, which yet unto that very day we called <hi>Gaul,</hi> and which a little after, changed it for the name of <hi>France:</hi> Who afterwards peopling it, he ſetled his Scepter there, planted the Religion of his Fathers, and inſtructed ſome of the beſt Wits amongſt them with his own Documents and Sciences, who ever ſince after his own name were called <hi>Samothes.</hi> This man was the firſt King of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> who was ſo pleaſing both unto god and men, that he had a long, proſperous, and peaceable Raigne; and after him his Poſterity in ſuch renown, as all the world did ring with his, and the valour of the <hi>Gaules.</hi> Afterwards the <hi>Romans</hi> uſurped the Dominion of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> by reaſon of our own civill diſſentions, who being full of animoſity and faction amongſt our ſelves, did invite them amongſt us, and asked aide of them, whoſe ambition hath ſince devoured us; teaching us, but too late, that no ſtrangers will ever love us better than we do our ſelves. But that great god, whom <hi>Samothes</hi> taught us to adore in purity of heart, not deſiring to continue his anger againſt us for ever, after we had been a while under the Dominion of theſe ſtrangers, did deliver us from them by the Armes of the <hi>Francks,</hi> who ſay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be deſcended from the ancient <hi>Gaules.</hi> Now to return unto our diſcourſe. The fourth King which raigned in <hi>Gaul,</hi> who deſcended from the great and holy <hi>Samothes,</hi> was the wiſe and learned <hi>Dryus,</hi> from whom the Druides took their denomination. But thoſe are miſtaken, as well as the over-bold <hi>Greeks,</hi> who boaſt, that they were ſo called from their word <hi>Drys,</hi> which ſignifies an Oake; for, before Letters or Learning ever came into <hi>Greece,</hi> we called them Druides, and the Sciences were in <hi>Gaul</hi> before they did know ſo much as how to read, as the name of Druide teacheth us, which in the Language of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothes's</hi> Grandfather does ſignifie, <hi>Contemplator,</hi> from the word <hi>Driſſim;</hi> and, as you know (my Son) our principall part of Profeſſion, conſiſts in contemplation of the works of God.</p>
               <p>Now this great <hi>Dis, Samothes,</hi> and after him, our holy <hi>Dryus,</hi> did command us to worſhip god, not according to the erroneous cuſtome of Nations, but as they had been taught by their Fathers, and becauſe the dull ignorance of the people was ſuch, as they could not comprehend that ſupream goodneſſe and infinite power, which they called <hi>Thau,</hi> comprehending all, they gave him three names; <hi>Heſius,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Strong; Belinus,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Man god;</hi> and <hi>Tharamis,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Preſerver,</hi> teaching us by theſe three names, that god is the omnipotent Creator and Preſerver of men. But ſince, through the alteration of time, and ignorance of people, which changeth all things, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially names, in lieu of <hi>Thau,</hi> they ſay <hi>Thauta,</hi> and <hi>Thautes,</hi> and <hi>Theutates.</hi> In lieu of <hi>Jehus, Belenas,</hi> and <hi>Thaharamis,</hi> the aſpiration in the middle being harſh to pronounce, they ſay, <hi>Heſus, Belinus,</hi> and <hi>Tharamis:</hi> And the people had ſuch a power over the more knowing part of men, as they, to be underſtood, were forced to call them as the people did, and conſent unto their errour.</p>
               <p>But, Father, ſaid the ſhepheard, are not <hi>Teutates, Heſus, Tharamis,</hi> and <hi>Belinus,</hi> the ſame gods which are called <hi>Mercury, Mars, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Apollo?</hi> Are all theſe but one god? Son, ſaid the Druide, I wiſh I were able to make you underſtand what you ask; but where your underſtanding will not reach, let the beliefe which you have in me ſupply. Know therefore, that ſtrangers ſeeing how the <hi>Gaules</hi> adored and called upon <hi>Thautates</hi> in all their affaires, when they took any journey, and in all their actions; moreover con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that they were naturally lovers of eloquence, they thought, that it was <hi>Mercury</hi>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:53526:169"/>
whom they called upon, ſaying, that he was the god of Eloquence, the director in Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, the inventor of Arts, and the Protector of all Merchants and Traffick. Afterwards obſerving, that in our Wars we invoked <hi>Heſius,</hi> they thought him to be <hi>Mars,</hi> who was by them held to be the god of Armes. And when we deſired to be purged from our ſins, they ſaw us call upon <hi>Thamaris,</hi> &amp; they thought him to be <hi>Jupiter,</hi> from whom they expect all chaſtiſement, by reaſon of the thunderbolts that are attributed unto him. Beſides, they conceiving, that pardon of ſins being to be had from the greateſt of all the gods, they ſaid he muſt needs be <hi>Jupiter,</hi> becauſe he was the greateſt and moſt puiſſant. Then, becauſe we had recourſe unto <hi>Belinus,</hi> when we wanted health for our ſelves or friends, or deſired to have children, they perſwaded themſelves, that it muſt needs be their <hi>Apollo,</hi> whom they thought to be the firſt inventor of Phyſick; beſides, attributing unto him the guidance of the Sun; nay, very often taking the one for the other; and knowing, that the Sun gave life unto all Animalls, and moreover, that Man and the Sun did generate Man, they had ſom reaſon to think, that it was our <hi>Belinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But moſt certain it is (dear Son) that there can be but one god; for, if one be not omnipotent and all puiſſant, he is not god: if there were two omnipotents, or two pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſants, the omnipotency and the puiſſancy would be divided. Moreover, they muſt needs be either alike or diſlike; if they be alike in all things, they muſt be the ſame, and ſo only one; if they be diſlike, then good muſt be different from good, which cannot be. I inſtance only in theſe familiar arguments, becauſe I will not puzle your underſtanding with ſuch as are more obſcure and more ſublime, although they be ſtronger and more preſſing. I did ever believe (ſaid <hi>Celadon)</hi> that there was but one god and one lord over us all, and above all the reſt of the gods; but, I believed alſo, that as amongſt Men, we ſee, that Kings have their ſubordinate Officers, ſo that there are inferiours or petty gods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, which is the ſupream and great one of all, whom we call <hi>Tautates,</hi> and the others, <hi>Heſius, Tharamis,</hi> and <hi>Belinus,</hi> which, next to him, are to be adored. This beliefe (anſwered the Druide) hath ſome colour and reaſon in it, yet it is a great errour; for thoſe whom you named laſt are not gods, but only denominations of the great <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates:</hi> But, though I muſt confeſſe, he hath ſubordinate Officers under him, as Terreſtriall Kings have; yet, you muſt underſtand, that worſhip and adoration is due only unto one god. Why then, Father, ſaid <hi>Celadon,</hi> are they placed in our Temples ſo neer the great <hi>Tautates?</hi> Son (ſaid <hi>Adamas)</hi> I told you before, that the Romans mixed their Religion with ours: You muſt know, that by our Lawes, it is forbidden to make any image of god; for, an Image being a repreſentation of ſomething, and there muſt needs be ſome proportion betwixt the thing repreſenting and the thing repreſented; we do conceive, that there is nothing amongſt men, which can hold any proportion or reſemblance with god, and therefore we do expreſly forbid it; and indeed, we do diſallow of any Temples, thinking it moſt groſſe ignorance to imagine, an infinite immenſe deitie within any walls can be confined; and think it a moſt preſumptuous boldneſſe to imagine, any houſe can be worthy of him. And therefore, after the manner of the Antients, the Father and Grandfather of the great <hi>Samothes,</hi> did command us to adore god in Groves and in Fields; yet, Groves were conſecrated unto him, by the devotion of the people, leſt they ſhould be profaned: And in thoſe places, they made choice of great Oakes, under which god was worſhipped. And hereupon it was, that the <hi>Romans</hi> entring into our Country, and ſeeing our ſacred Groves and manner of our Sacrifices, did with amazement ſay, that we, amongſt all men, had the greateſt knowledge of god, and that the <hi>Gaules</hi> were the moſt religious and fulleſt of devotion, of any people in the world. But the Conquerors alwaies giving what Lawes they liſt unto the Conquered, they did moſt tyrannically uſurp, not only upon our Land, but our Souls alſo; changed our ceremonies, made us worſhip their gods, forced us to build Temples, and to receive their Idolls, to repreſent <hi>Tautates, Heſius, Belinus,</hi> and <hi>Tharamis,</hi> under the figures of their <hi>Mars, Mercury, Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter.</hi> And becauſe this went much againſt the conſciences of our Druides, one of their Emperors by publick Edict in Senate, baniſhed and aboliſhed our Religion, and chaſed the Druides out of the Empire: But for all that, the great <hi>Tautates</hi> permitted this only, to make tryall of their vertues, and not to aboliſh them; manifeſting, that he never does entirely forſake the good. So as maugre the malice and tyranny of theſe ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, we have ſtill preſerved ſome purity in our Sacrifices, and worſhip god as he ought to be, and even in this Country, we have ever acknowledged the power of theſe uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, out of the reſpect they alwaies had unto <hi>Diana,</hi> of whom they think our great
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:53526:169"/>
Nymph is a repreſentation. And now at this time, the <hi>Francks</hi> have brought with them their Druides, and making it appear they were formerly <hi>Gaules,</hi> our authority and ſacred cuſtomes are revived again in ſplendor. But, Father (ſaid <hi>Celadon)</hi> I have ſeen in our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Groves, Images of great <hi>Dis</hi> and of <hi>Hercules.</hi> The reaſon of that was, (anſwered <hi>Adamas)</hi> becauſe they were men and not gods; and being but men, they may be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. But (replyed <hi>Celadon)</hi> if they be not gods, why do you ſet them upon Altars? You muſt know, (anſwered <hi>Adamas)</hi> that they were men, who for their vertues were like unto gods, and as ſuch, we ought to honour them, and preſerve their memory, to the end, others may take them for paternes of vertue: But ſtrangers, who were ignorant of our intentions, did think, that we did adore and worſhip them, and ſay, that <hi>Dis</hi> was <hi>Pluto,</hi> from whom we ſay we are deſcended; and gave unto <hi>Hercules</hi> the ſirname of <hi>Gaulois,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we much honour his memory, as well becauſe he was full of heroick vertues, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he married the fair <hi>Galathea</hi> our Princeſſe, and Daughter of <hi>Celtes</hi> our King. You tell me things, ſaid <hi>Celadon,</hi> which do much raviſh me, and I beſeech you, Father, go on, and tell me what I ſhall do, when I ſhall enter into thoſe Temples, where I ſhall finde the Images of <hi>Jupiter, Mars, Pallas, Venus,</hi> and ſuch like gods and goddeſſes. Son, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Adamas,</hi> you muſt be very well adviſed when you do go thither: and above all, be ſure you do not take them for gods, but only Vertues Puiſſances, and Effects of one onely god. In <hi>Jupiter,</hi> you muſt adore the omnipotency and majeſty of god; in <hi>Mars,</hi> his power; in <hi>Pallas,</hi> his wiſdome; in <hi>Venus,</hi> his beauty, and ſo of all the reſt: By this means, you will render unto our great <hi>Tautates,</hi> that worſhip which is his due, and ſhew your ſelfe juſt unto thoſe vertuous Perſons and Heroes, in honouring them dead, as you would have done if they had been alive. And ſo much for this time; and if you do frequent my company, I ſhall acquaint you with more. Now, Child, leaving this diſcourſe, let us make the form of a Temple here in this Grove, which was long ſince dedicated unto <hi>Teu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates</hi> our god: It being in a Grove, we ſhall obſerve our antient Ordinances; and becauſe a Temple, we ſhall obey theſe ſtrangers. I will write upon this miraculous Oake, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred name of <hi>Teutates;</hi> and upon the three branches, that on the right hand, I will write <hi>Heſius,</hi> on that in the middle, <hi>Tharamis,</hi> and on that upon the left hand, <hi>Belinus;</hi> and then upon the top of all, where they are united together, we will engrave the ſacred name of <hi>Teutates,</hi> to ſhew, that we mean only one god, under the notion of theſe three words or nominations.</p>
               <p>If I durſt diſcover unto you the ſacred and profound myſteries of our religion, I ſhould acquaint you with an Interpretation, which <hi>Samothes,</hi> the moſt knowing man, did leave unto us, and which, by tradition from Father to Son is come unto us, how that theſe three names do ſignifie three perſons, which are but one god, <hi>god the mighty, god the man,</hi> and <hi>god the preſerver;</hi> the father, the ſon, and the preſerver; and all theſe three, do make but one <hi>Tautates,</hi> which is god: And it is unto the Mother of this <hi>god man,</hi> unto whom our Druides, twenty ages ago, did dedicate an Altar in the Cave of <hi>Carnutes,</hi> with the ſtatue of a Virgin upon it, holding a Child in her armes, with this Inſcription: <hi>To the Virgin, who ſhall bring forth a Child.</hi> But theſe myſteries are too high for your capacity, and leſt we ſhould profane them, it is better to be ſilent. Let us go on with our work. Perhaps ſome learned Druide may come into this ſacred Grove, and will adore <hi>Teutates</hi> in purity of heart as we do; he will commend our work, and approve of our good intentions.</p>
               <p>Thus did the Druide diſcourſe upon the hidden myſteries of his religion; and becauſe they were above the underſtanding of the ſhepheard, he would ſay no more. But as ſoon as thoſe three names were engraved upon the Tree, they kneeled down and adored them, and never approached them, but with abundance of reverence. Now leſt <hi>Celadon</hi> ſhould be tired in his devotion by working, he called the Temple by the name of the goddeſſe <hi>Aſtrea:</hi> And, Son, ſaid he, this is no offence unto the great god, ſo you honour this <hi>Aſtrea</hi> only, as the moſt perfect piece of work that ever they ſhewed unto men. <hi>Celadon</hi> did eaſily conſent unto this, and with incredible zeal, he worked ſo aſſiduouſly, as within a few daies he finiſhed the Temple, according to the Druide's appointment, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending his diligence and induſtry, and the more to encourage him, did bring him the Lawes of Love, and the Embleme of reciprocall Amity. But approaching the Altar of <hi>Aſtrea</hi> he knew not what to ſet upon it; yet after he had a while thought upon it: If you were a good Limner, ſaid he unto him, I am ſure the features of the fair <hi>Aſtrea's</hi> face is very freſh in your memory, you may draw her Picture, and ſet it upon this Altar, which
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:53526:170"/>
is dedicated unto her; but ſince you are not yet ſo good an Artiſt, I will cauſe a Table to be made, and only write her name upon it. To which, the ſhepheard returned this anſwer: You have ſome reaſon, Father for your beliefe, for the features of her faireſt face are not only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed freſh in my memory, ſo as me thinks I alwaies ſee her; but alſo her ſpeech, her garb, her attire, and all her actions, are ſo lively in my ſoul, as me-thinks I do continually ſee them. But, though I am no Artiſt in Limning, yet I am able to ſhew you her reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, upon condition, you will reſtore it unto me again: Upon a promiſe of which, he unbuttoned his breaſt, and opening the Caſe which he wore about his neck, he ſhewed him <hi>Aſtrea's</hi> Picture: But, Father, (ſaid he) if you do loſe it, or not reſtore it unto me again, moſt certainly I ſhall die, no excuſe or conſolation can ſave me. After <hi>Adamas</hi> had vowed by <hi>Tautates,</hi> that he would reſtore it, the ſhepheard, after a moſt zealous kiſſe of it, did truſt it into his hands. The Druide looking upon it: Truly, Son, (ſaid he) I muſt needs confeſſe, I never ſaw a face more fair, nor in which I diſcover ſo much modeſt love and ſweet ſeverity; happy is the Father of ſuch a Child, and happy the Mother who bare her, happy the eyes who ſee her; but infinitely happy he that muſt enjoy her. Afterwards he put it up into the Caſe, with a promiſe to reſtore it very ſhortly, which he did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, within five or ſix daies.</p>
               <p>It was in this place, where <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and all the Company did finde ſo many Verſes and Writings of <hi>Celadon</hi>'s; for he was ſo pleaſed with his works, that he was continually before the Image of his ſhepheardeſſe, and adoring her in his very ſoul; As imaginations and fancies came into his head, he writ them down, and laid them upon the Altar, as offerings unto the goddeſſe <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> It was this ſhepheard and <hi>Adamas</hi> whom <hi>Silvander</hi> ſaw in the night; for the Druide, by frequenting him ſo continually, did make him forget moſt of his ſad thoughts; and the ſhepheard alſo, did think him ſelfe ſo exceedingly obliged unto him, for his indulgent aſſiſtance, as he did infinitly honour him. <hi>Leonida,</hi> ſince this, went not ſo oft to viſit the ſhepheardeſſe as ſhe was wont. In the mean time, <hi>Celadon</hi> lived thus, ſometimes more, ſometimes leſſe afflicted, even as his thoughts gave him leave, untill he met with <hi>Silvander,</hi> into whoſe hands he put the Letter which he writ unto the ſhepheardeſſe <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> who ſince, cauſed all theſe ſhepheardeſſes and ſhepheards to come into this place, where having loſt their way, they were conſtrained to reſt themſelves, with intention to depart as ſoon as the <hi>Moon</hi> began to appear; but the paines and toile which the ſhepheardeſſes had taken all the day, and a great part of the night, had ſo tired them, that they ſlept longer than they intended; for when the <hi>Moon</hi> was up, and very light, the ſhepheards themſelves were all aſleep. But on the contrary, the ſad <hi>Celadon,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his cuſtome, was up betimes, purpoſely to entertain his own thoughts, and none met him, for his uſe was, to walk moſt out when others ſlept, and ſhut up himſelfe all the day. The <hi>Sun</hi> did not yet appear, when it was his fortune to walk towards the place where this company was; and being wholly taken up with his ſad thoughts, never minding any thing about him, never man was ſo planet-ſtruck as he was, when upon a ſudden he eſpied <hi>Aſtrea:</hi> ſhe had a thin handkerchief upon her eyes, which did a little cover her face, one arme under her head, and the other by her ſide, her petticoat a little ruffled up, ſo as one might ſee the delicate proportion of her leg; the admirable pureneſſe of her neck was plainly ſeen, the azure veins upon a ſnowy skin did raviſh; and becauſe ſhe was a little ſtrait laced, ſhe unlaced her ſelfe, and the rich treaſure of her breaſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; her hair was looſe and lay negligently upon her lovely cheeks. Oh! what a viſion was this unto <hi>Celadon?</hi> he was ſo amazed, that he ſtood ſtock ſtill, without any pulſe or breath, or any ſigne of life, but the beating of his heart, and his ſight which was fixed upon this fair object. It was with him, as with thoſe who have been long in darkneſſe, and come ſuddenly into the rayes of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and are dazled with too much light, and cannot ſee. Preſently after, having a little recollected himſelfe, he began to conſider what he ſaw; looking ſometimes upon her lovely face, ſometimes upon her breaſt, whoſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures were never before diſcovered; and he wiſhed, <hi>Argos-like,</hi> that he had a body all of eyes. But in the midſt of this pleaſing contemplation, a thought came into his minde, which blaſted all his joy. Retire, retire, unfortunate ſhepheard (ſaid he) retire from this bleſſed place, let it be no longer profaned with thy unhallowed eyes: Haſt thou ſo ſoon forgot her commands? Doſt thou not remember, it is not lawfull for thee to preſent thy ſelfe before her eyes? Away, away, for ſhame offend no longer. Thus he went away, with folded armes, and eyes lifted up to heaven, as if he had left heart ſoul life, and all behinde him: His thoughts and his way were much different; for the further he went from <hi>Aſtrea,</hi>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:53526:170"/>
the more his thoughts followed him. When he was out of ſight, he was ſo troubled, as he was forced to ſtay: To go on, ſaid he, I cannot; to return, I dare not; and to ſtay here, is to no purpoſe: What then ſhould I do? Go, go, ſaid he, and receive that favour, which the heavens, unasked, does beſtow upon thee. But how can I contradict the command of her, whom I did never diſobey? But, anſwered he, it is not contradicting her command; for ſhe did not command me, not to ſee her, for then I ſhould put out my eyes; but her command was, that I ſhould not come in her ſight; and how can ſhe ſee me when ſhe is aſleep? Take Love therefore for thy guide, and under his conduct go and adore her. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved with this conſideration, he turned back, and went as ſoftly as he could, leſt he ſhould awake her; as ſoon as he came ſo neer as to ſee her, he kneeled down, adored her, and preſented this prayer unto her, in a whiſpering voice.</p>
               <p>Oh great and puiſſant goddeſſe! ſince it is more god-like to pardon then to puniſh, I moſt devoutly proſtrate my ſelfe upon my knees before you. I will not argue the matter with you, nor aske, whether my torments, which I have ſuffered through my ſins, be not above the grandure of them, ſince I ſinned ignorantly; only I beg for pitty. Shew your ſelfe all divine in pardoning, and remitting me to my loſt felicity; for my ſubmiſſion may as well move you to pardon, as my unknown offence unto puniſhment.</p>
               <p>This was the prayer of the ſad ſhepheard, not daring hardly to let the words go out of his lips, for fear of waking her, unto whom they were addreſſed. Then he aroſe and went neerer to her, the better to look upon her: As he was deeply in his contemplation, <hi>Phillis</hi> turned her ſelfe from one ſide to the other, yet not opening her eyes, nor waking. This put <hi>Celadon</hi> in ſuch a fright, that he ran as faſt as he could unto his ſad habitation, where he no ſooner was, but thinking upon this encounter, and that of the day before, he knew not whether he ſhould take it as a good or a bad preſage. At the laſt, thinking upon that Letter which he put into the hand of <hi>Silvander,</hi> (for he ſuppoſed <hi>Aſtrea</hi> did know of it) he reſolved to hazard another; and therefore, to loſe no time, he went to write it; leſt he ſhould be too late, and the ſhepheardeſſes awake. He ſuperſcribed this as he did the firſt, and went with all haſte to the place where he left his ſhepheardeſſe; but being afraid ſhe ſhould be awake when he came neer her, he crept behinde ſome Trees, and looking every way, he knew they were ſtill aſleep; but he found the company was greater then he perceived at the firſt, becauſe then he did not ſee the ſhepheards, of whom we ſpoke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and, to ſee whether any of them was of his acquaintance, he went gently towards them; the firſt he ſaw was <hi>Silvander:</hi> Oh faithfull friend, (ſaid he, in a low voice) how much am I obliged unto thee, for doing more for me then I durſt ever ask? Then turning his eyes upon the other foure ſhepheards, he knew none of them; yet he thought, he had ſeen <hi>Tircis</hi> heretofore. Finding them all thus aſleep, he went towards the ſhepheardeſſes. The Sun was already a good height, and finding paſſage through the leaves, it began to ſhine in ſome places upon them, ſo as if this ſhepheard had been as impartiall a Judge of Beauty, as he was a perfect Lover, he could hardly have told unto which of all theſe he ſhould have given the prize of Beauty: But as the long griefs of <hi>Aſtrea</hi> had then made her yield ſomething unto <hi>Diana,</hi> ſo the affection of this ſhepheard did ſupply that defect, and gave judgment on <hi>Aſtrea</hi>'s ſide. Then looking particularly upon <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> he kneeled down, and could not chuſe but kiſſe her fair hand, afterwards did put the Letter into her breaſt; and being tranſported with love, he could not chuſe but kiſſe her mouth: Oh how the ſhepheard was raviſhed! he had almoſt quite forgot all fears of waking her, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo upon her, that ſhe began to awake, and opened her drouſie eyes, when he was halfe riſen up; and had not the Sun-beams, which ſhined upon her face, dazled her eyes, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſhe had known him; this was the reaſon ſhe could not ſee him, but as a ſhaddow, and when ſhe began to look after him, her hair was ſo intangld with a few ruſhes that was under her head, that they did hinder her; ſo as ſhe could not chuſe but cry out aloud <hi>Phillis</hi> ſtarted up and asked her what the matter was? But <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was ſo aſtoniſhed, that ſhe could not ſpeak, but ſtill untangled her hair. <hi>Phillis</hi> ſeeing <hi>Aſtrea</hi> up, and let a paper fall, ſhe aroſe alſo, and was very officious to take it up, following her ſome twenty paces from the place where they lay. Then <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſat down under a Tree, extreamly pale, and ready to ſwound, which <hi>Phillis</hi> ſeeing, ſhe helped her all ſhe could; and when ſhe was a little come unto her ſelfe: Oh dear Siſter, (ſaid ſhe unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> with a deep ſigh) what is this which I have ſeen? Then ſhe was ſilent a long while, and could not ſpeak for ſighing; a little after,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:53526:171"/>
ſhe began with a very great ſigh, and ſaid: Oh Siſter, I have ſeen <hi>Celadon,</hi> I mean his Ghoſt. At this word <hi>[Celadon]</hi> her voice failed, and her tongue could not do its office; but ſhe joyned her hands together, and liſted her eyes up to heaven, as if from thence ſhe begged help. <hi>Phillis</hi> ſeeing her in this condition believed, that ſhe had been in ſome afrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting dream: Siſter, ſaid ſhe unto her, there is no credit to be given unto any dreams, they are no more but the working of the fancy and imagination, upon ſuch ſubjects as have been ſeen or thought upon; nor are they any preſages of things future, only images and fancies of things paſt. Ah Siſter, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> this was no dream; I ſaw him with theſe eyes, and as ſoon as ever he ſaw I looked upon him, he vaniſhed into aire. Perhaps, Siſter, (ſaid <hi>Phillis)</hi> you did but think your ſelfe to be awake, for ſo it often happens in ſleep. No, no, (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea)</hi> I was awake. And how did you ſee him, ſaid <hi>Phillis?</hi> I was (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea)</hi> betwixt ſleeping and waking, when I heard ſome ſighing about me, even about my face; and when I opened my eyes, I ſaw the ſoul of <hi>Celadon</hi> before me: but, Oh hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens! how glorious and full of light it was? the Sun it ſelfe had no more ſplendent luſtre; And, Siſter, I was even dazled at the ſight of it, untill I came hither; but as ſoon as ever I did caſt my eye upon him, he vaniſhed like lightning. Oh glorious Soul! thou hadſt good reaſon not to let the ſight of her fully thee, who was ſo undiſcreetly careleſſe of thy life. How infinitely am I obliged unto thee, who having ſo much reaſon to hate me, yet makes it appear, that thy love continues. <hi>Phillis,</hi> with much amazement, did now believe, that certainly it was the ſoul of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and therefore ſaid thus unto her: All we can do for thoſe who are departed this life, is to preſerve their memory, to talk often of their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and to render them the laſt office of pitty, which is buriall; therefore I am of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it is requiſite, for your own contentinent, and ſatisfaction of this ſoul, who ſo much loved you, that you do cauſe a Tombe to be built, in which it may reſt, and to preſerve the memory of him amongſt us as long as poſſibly we can. That ſhall I do, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> as long as any life is in me. But, Siſter, (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea)</hi> would it not be taken ill, that I, who am not a kin unto him, ſhould render him this laſt office of a Sepulcher? What can be ſaid, (anſwered <hi>Phillis)</hi> but that his kindred neglecting their duty, you have done what they ought to have done? Were he alive, there might ſome doubt be made of it; but being dead, they may well imagine, that your paſt amity, which is known as well as your name, would require ſo much of you. As <hi>Phillis</hi> was thus talking to her, ſhe held in her hand the paper which ſhe took up, and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> caſting her eye accidentally upon it, and knowing it to be <hi>Celadon</hi>'s hand, ſhe asked her, what Letter that was which ſhe held in her hand? <hi>Phillis</hi> anſwered, that ſhe took it up, ſeeing it fall from her as ſhe aroſe. I did feel ſomething (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea)</hi> fall from my breaſt; but I was ſo much out of my ſelfe, that I never minded it. Then taking it, and reading the Superſcription, ſhe ſaid, it was that Letter which <hi>Silvander</hi> found. That cannot be, (ſaid <hi>Phillis)</hi> for I have that in my pocket; and putting her hand into it, ſhe pulled it out. What ſhould it then be, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea?</hi> I am ſure it is the ſame hand. Then reading it, ſhe found theſe words.</p>

Now did theſe ſhepheardeſſes believe, that <hi>Celadon</hi> was dead indeed, and Love made <hi>Aſtrea</hi> reſolve, to render him the laſt duty of her amity. Then ſhe went to wake <hi>Diana</hi> and the other ſhepheardeſſes, becauſe it was late; when they came, they found <hi>Silvander</hi> looking upon <hi>Diana</hi> as ſhe ſlept; and, gazing like an immovable Statue, he uttered theſe words in a very loud voice: Oh! how this fair one deprives me of that reſt which ſhe takes her ſelfe? See how many <hi>Cupids</hi> play about her lovely face! Who can chuſe but love her, and loſe that reſt which ſhe findes? To look upon her and to love her, is one and the ſame thing.

               <p>He ſpoke thus loud, becauſe he was not afraid of awaking her, ſince ſhe commanded him ſo to do, as ſoon as the Moon ſhined. But <hi>Celadon's</hi> good fortune would not have it ſo, to the end he might enjoy the happineſſe of ſeeing his Miſtreſſe in that place. After <hi>Silvander</hi> had uttered theſe words, he kneeled down to kiſſe her hand; but fearing to be ſeen by theſe two ſhepheardeſſes, who he ſaw were not in their places, he roſe up, very ſorry he had done ſo much, if he were ſeen. In the mean time, theſe two ſhepheardeſſes looked upon him, and <hi>Phillis,</hi> who was very deſirous to divert <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> Never truſt me, Siſter (ſaid ſhe unto her) if this ſhepheard do not love <hi>Diana,</hi> and is not ſo ſubtle as he thinks himſelfe. I ſpoke yeſterday with <hi>Diana</hi> (anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> very ſadly) and for ought I could perceive, he can expect nothing but much ſorrow; for, ſhe will neither love him, nor ſuffer him to love her. That reſolution (ſaid <hi>Phillis)</hi> may in a ſhort time bring <hi>Silvander</hi> into the ſame condition with <hi>Celadon,</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> into the ſame ſtate with <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> Ah Siſter, (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea) Silvander</hi> may run that fortune; but as long as <hi>Diana</hi> is free from love, her fortune will never be ſo bad as mine. I do confeſſe (replyed <hi>Phillis)</hi> that if ſhe be really exempt from love ſhe is not in that danger; but, if ſhe be exempt only out of diſſimulat<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>, what think you then? That ſhe will be happy only in opinion, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and in deed and truth miſerable. But there is no likelyhood of that, <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s humour, and <hi>Silvander</hi>'s perfections, being ſuch, that neither the ſhepheardeſſe nor he, can be ſubject unto ſuch dyſaſters. Upon this, <hi>Phillis</hi> took her by the hand and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked towards <hi>Diana;</hi> yet anſwered her; Oh Siſter (ſaid ſhe) you are deceived, if you be of that opinion: for, as concerning the merits of <hi>Silvander,</hi> believe it, that when a ſhepheard has a deſigne to pleaſe, he ſpruſeth himſelfe up, and is quite another man from what he really is: And hence it is, that we often wonder to ſee ſome ſhepheards loved and welco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, who are thought not at all pleaſing or handſome; and from hence, I believe, the Proverb came, that, Love makes all ſeem handſome: Nay, I will ſay more, I never yet ſaw any ſhepheard diſpleaſing unto her he courted, if there were not ſome other occaſion of hatred then his love; for, their courtſhip and deſire to pleaſe, does make them dreſſe up themſelves in the ſmootheſt garb they can, purpoſely to render themſelves complaiſant: as this is the quality of all in generall, ſo more ſpecially in <hi>Silvander,</hi> whoſe wit, and handſome compoſure by nature, may eaſily ſupply all defects. And as for the humour of <hi>Diana,</hi> her affection unto <hi>Philander</hi> is an infallible argument, that ſhe hath not been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies inſenſible of Love; and why may not that which was once, be again. For my part, I do believe, Love is as good an Archer as ever he was, and has not forgotten the skill he uſed, the firſt time he wounded her: and <hi>Silvander</hi> may have the ſame fortune <hi>Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> had. In this (ſaid <hi>Aſtrea)</hi> you and I do differ in opinion, and I do think it impoſſible, <hi>Diana</hi> ſhould ever love again; for I think, a Maid, who never was in love, may eaſily be allured by the pleaſing flatteries of it; but impoſſible, that a ſtayed perſon, who did once love, and loſt the perſon loved, ſhould ever let love take any root again in her ſoul: And me-thinks the Cypreſſe-Tree is a right emblem of my affection, which, when once cut, never puts out branch again. As ſoon as ſhe had ſaid ſo, they were come ſo neer unto <hi>Diana,</hi> that <hi>Phillis</hi> could make no other anſwer but this: Siſter, we ſhall quickly ſee, which of our opinions is the right.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe ſhepheardeſſes were thus talking, <hi>Paris, Hylas, Tircis,</hi> and <hi>Therſander,</hi> being awakened by <hi>Silvander,</hi> they came to the ſhepheardeſſes, and ſpoke ſo loud, that they awaked <hi>Diana.</hi> She was much aſhamed, to ſee her ſelfe almoſt quite undreſt, amongſt all that good company; and therefore holding her hair with one hand, and covering her breaſt with the other, ſhe went further from them behinde ſome Trees: <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> followed her, and whilſt ſhe dreſſed her ſelfe, related unto her <hi>Aſtrea</hi>'s viſion, how the Letter fell from her breaſt, and how <hi>Aſtrea</hi> had reſolved to build a Tombe for the ſoul of <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſince his Kindred neglected it.
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:53526:172"/>
This office (anſwered <hi>Diana)</hi> is indeed full of piety and pitty, and for my part, I ſhould not diſapprove of it, if it would not be an occaſion of much talk and wonder, that the enmity of your Parents ſhould be changed into ſo much good-will. What wonder will it be, replyed the ſad ſhepheardeſſe? It would be more ſtrange, if this enmity ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue after death. If <hi>Celadon</hi> were alive, doubtleſſe I ſhould not let the affection which I bear unto him, be known. But, alas! ſince to my ſoules eternall ſadneſſe, he is not alive, I would not have both earth and heaven ignorant of it. And upon this reaſon, I do ground my reſolution; my friends will never finde fault with any thing that ſhall pleaſe me, and as for the reſt, I will never deprive my ſelfe of my contentment, to content them. Since you are reſolved upon it, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> I conceive, that the ſooner you do it, the better; and if you will take my counſell, it ſhall be before you depart hence. But (ſaid <hi>Phillis)</hi> where will you finde things neceſſary for it, unleſſe we firſt go unto our Town? The Temple of the good goddeſſe (ſaid <hi>Diana)</hi> where the Druides Daughters, and the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalls do inhabit, is not far from hence, and they will not deny any thing that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for ſo good a work. But let us call <hi>Paris</hi> and the ſhepheards, and ask them their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Upon this, <hi>Phillis</hi> called them, and they came unto her. Then <hi>Diana</hi> taking <hi>Paris</hi> aſide, acquainted him with the viſion and deſigne of <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> and becauſe, ſaid ſhe, detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and calumny is apt to aſperſe the pureſt innocency, I deſire this courteſie from you, that this Tomb may be erected in your name, though intended by the ſhepheardeſſe. You may command me all that is within the compaſſe of my power, ſaid <hi>Paris,</hi> for I am devoted wholly unto your ſervice. After <hi>Diana</hi> had given him very hearty thanks, ſhe deſired him to acquaint all the Company with this intention; which he did, ſo diſcreetly, as every one, except <hi>Silvander,</hi> believed, that this deſigne proceeded from him; but that ſhepheard, not being ignorant of <hi>Aſtrea's</hi> affection unto <hi>Celadon,</hi> did ſuſpect this to be an handſome umbrage: And becauſe he highly eſteemed <hi>Aſtrea</hi>'s <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he, he himſelfe helped in the diſſimulation, and offered to go unto the Temple of the good goddeſſe, to borrow ſuch things as were neceſſary for it. <hi>Aſtrea</hi> her ſelfe would go alſo, thinking that her preſence would prevail much, becauſe of the affection which <hi>Chriſante,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſſe of the Druides Daughters, had unto her. She therefore deſired <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> to ſtay there with <hi>Diana,</hi> whilſt <hi>Madonthe</hi> and ſhe went with <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> unto the Temple, which was cloſe by, with a promiſe to be back again, as ſoon as <hi>Paris</hi> and the other ſhepheards had raiſed up a bank of graſſy Tur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es, and prepared flowers and all things neceſſary. Thus went the ſhepheardeſſe <hi>Aſtrea</hi> away; and <hi>Paris</hi> beginning to work, made choice of a place neer that where they ſlept, which was a little plain, void of Trees, where abundance of ſeverall ſorts of flowers did grow, as if it were purpoſely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for ſuch a buſineſſe. <hi>Tircis</hi> and <hi>Hylas,</hi> with the iron of their ſheephooks and knives, for want of better Tooles, did cut the Sods of graſſe, and pilde them one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the modell of a Tombe, whilſt <hi>Diana, Phillis,</hi> and <hi>Laonice,</hi> did gather variety of flowers to ſtrew upon it, when the ceremony was to be performed; every one was ſo diligent in their ſeverall charges, that they finiſhed it in a little time. Now there wanted nothing but a columne to be ſet upon it, which ſhould demonſtrate the place where <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon</hi> dyed, and contain his Epitaph: but having no Hatchet to cut it, nor Inke to write withall, they were at a great ſtand. At laſt, <hi>Tircis</hi> remembered, that at the Temple of the goddeſſe <hi>Aſtrea, Hylas</hi> had found ſome way to write, when he falſified the Lawes of Love, and therefore doubtleſſe he left the pen and ink there; therefore they deſired him to go and fetch it. He, in obedience to the commands of his Miſtreſſe, went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and promiſed to return preſently.
<hi>Paris,</hi> deſirous to have all things ready, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelfe unto <hi>Diana,</hi> he told her, that it was requiſite to make choice of a Pole to ſupport the Piramis, that they would try if they could cut it with their knives; and leſt they ſhould be wanting when <hi>Aſtrea</hi> came, they would go to look for one that way which ſhe was to come. Leaving therefore the River upon the left hand, they went into the Wood, to look for this Pole amongſt the young Trees: But they went through the Wood, and never minded this Pole; for <hi>Diana,</hi> ſhe thought, that <hi>Paris</hi> did look out for one that was fit, but <hi>Paris</hi> was ſo taken up with the thoughts of her, that he never minded either North or South-Pole, nor any elſe; which <hi>Diana</hi> perceiving, ſhe ſaid unto <hi>Tircis:</hi> I thought, that we ſhould not have been ſo curious in our choice of this Pole, as not to finde one in all this Wood. I conceive (anſwered <hi>Tircis)</hi> that there are many good ones for the purpoſe. It muſt be a very great one (ſaid <hi>Paris)</hi> otherwiſe it will not ſerve. But it muſt not be too great and tall (ſaid <hi>Tircis)</hi> leſt the winde ſhould preſently blow it
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:53526:172"/>
down; ſo as if it be about twenty foot long, it will be big enough. 'Tis very true anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Paris;</hi> but I muſt needs confeſſe, that my thoughts were ſo much upon another thing, as I never minded or looked for one. How, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> and ſmiled, have you made us loſe all our labour? Then <hi>Paris</hi> turning towards <hi>Tircis,</hi> deſired him to make choice of one that was fit, and ſaid unto <hi>Diana:</hi> Blame me not, I beſeech you, fair <hi>Diana,</hi> for the fault which I have committed, for it is abſolutely impoſſible to be ſo neer you, and think upon any thing elſe. That excuſe (anſwered <hi>Diana)</hi> might be mine as well as yours; for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo neer you, my thoughts alſo might have been as much of you. If your merits and mine were equall, (anſwered <hi>Paris)</hi> or our wills the ſame, then perhaps it might have been your excuſe as well as mine. If there was any fault, it was on my ſide, anſwered <hi>Diana.</hi> Yes, ſaid <hi>Paris</hi> preſently, for there was nothing in me which could take up your thoughts. I do not apprehend that to be the cauſe, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> for I do eſteem and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you as I ought to do. I would to god, <hi>Diana,</hi> (anſwered <hi>Paris)</hi> that you were as juſt as you are fair. Wherein do you think me unjuſt, (ſaid <hi>Diana)</hi> for how ſhould I eſteem and honour you more then I do? This eſteem and this honour, of which you ſpeak (ſaid he) is not that which I demand; but if you would be pleaſed to change this eſteem into affection, and this honour into familiarity, I ſhould be fully contented and ſatisfied. I know you (anſwered ſhe) more reaſonable, then to deſire any more: Content your ſelfe, generous <hi>Paris,</hi> that I do love and eſteem you as much, as if you were my Brother: I know, that I being a ſhepheardeſſe, and you as you are, I ought not to go any further; but I had rather offend againſt the Lawes of civility, than diſpleaſe you, ſince it is your pleaſure to have it ſo. This, replyed <hi>Paris,</hi> is a beginning of what I deſire, but not all. In this (anſwered <hi>Diana)</hi> as in all things elſe, your deſires muſt be ruled by reaſon. Is it not reaſonable (ſaid <hi>Paris)</hi> that <hi>Diana</hi> ſhould make choice of one, whom ſhe will create happy, and with whom ſhe may live happily? This choice (replyed <hi>Diana)</hi> is a piece of great difficulty, and I will ever refer it unto thoſe, that are wiſer than my ſelfe. Who are they, ſaid <hi>Paris?</hi> Who ſhould they be, anſwered <hi>Diana,</hi> but my Mother and my Uncle? <hi>Paris</hi> would have replyed, if <hi>Tircis</hi> had not interrupted him, and told him, that he had found out a fit Pole. <hi>Diana</hi> was very glad of this, for this diſcourſe began to vex her. <hi>Paris,</hi> on the contrary, was very ſorry; for he deſired to know of her, whether ſhe would be pleaſed to let him ſpeak unto them concerning it. But <hi>Diana</hi> fearing it, ſhe deſired <hi>Phillis</hi> not to be ſo far from her as ſhe had been, leſt <hi>Paris</hi> ſhould fall into this diſcourſe again: But having made choice of a Pole, they tryed to cut it; but their knives not being ſtrong enough, they were conſtrained only to mark it, and ſtay till <hi>Aſtrea</hi> returned, believing, that <hi>Silvander</hi> would not forget any thing that was requiſite for the buſineſſe. Walking therefore towards the Temple of the good goddeſſe, and <hi>Paris</hi> ſtill hoping to fall into his diſcourſe again, they eſpyed, as they were going out of the Wood, a ſhepheardeſſe, ſitting under a ſhady Sycamour, and her hair being very long and curled, as it covered her almoſt all over as ſhe ſat, they could not imagine what it ſhould be; but approaching a little neerer, they knew her to be a ſhepheardeſſe; yet, ſince her diſhevelled hair would not let them ſee her face, they were very deſirous to approach neerer: And as they were looking upon her, they ſaw a young ſhepheard come, and fall upon his knees before her, who ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed her before ſhe had time to riſe: Neither this ſhepheard nor ſhepheardeſſe were known unto any of this Company, although they were both inhabitants in their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Town. As for the ſhepheardeſſe, ſhe might well be ſaid to be fair, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence of her hair and habit, rather added then took away from her handſomneſſe. But this Company was moſt of all amazed, to ſee another ſhepheard, who eſpying them, did look upon them with a ſtrange diſcompoſed action, yet had a deſire to conceal it, and himſelfe both; ſometimes he thruſt his head out of the buſh which covered him, and hearkened what they ſaid with a moſt attentive ear; othertimes he did ſhake and ſcratch his head, and upon a ſudden hold both his hands up to heaven, then let them fall again in a paſſionate poſture. To be briefe, he was ſo impatient to ſee them together, that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of paſſion appeared in all his actions. On the other ſide, the ſhepheardeſſe ſeemed ſo diſpleaſed with the ſight of him that kneeled before her, as ſhe would not daigne him a look, but made all the haſte ſhe could in dreſſing her ſelfe, that ſhe might be gone from that place. <hi>Diana</hi> and her Company ſeeing the beauty and diſdain of this ſhepheardeſſe, alſo the affection and ſubmiſſion of him that kneeled before her, and the paſſionate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of him that looked on, they had a great deſire to know more of the buſineſſe; and therefore, untill <hi>Aſtrea</hi> returned, they approached as neer as they could unſeen unto
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:53526:173"/>
them, &amp; then they heard the ſhepheard with a deep ſigh ſay thus unto her: Is it poſſible, fair ſhepheardeſſe, that neither my deſire to ſerve you, nor the power you have to make your ſelf adored, ſhould have any prevalence with you? I know not (anſwered ſhe diſdainfully) what your deſires are, nor what my power is; but I am ſure, that any thing which comes from you can never pleaſe me. This (anſwered the ſhepheard) is the worſt of misfortunes that ever could befall me. If cuſtome (replyed the ſhepheardeſſe) do make things difficult to be eaſily ſupported, me thinks you ſhould not ſo deeply reſent the misfortunes of it, ſince you have been ſo long accuſtomed unto it; for, ever ſince the firſt houre you decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red your minde unto me, I did ſo cleerly acquaint you with mine, as you might that firſt time have known as much, as you have ſince found, or ever ſhall do. Oh <hi>Doris,</hi> (anſwered the ſhepheard) if my ſoul were as regardleſſe of your diſdaines, as your heart is of my prayers, certainly I ſhould never have reſented them: But alas, this cuſtome ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders me more ſenſible, as he, who has a heavy burthen upon his back, the longer he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it, the more inſupportable it is. The ſhepheardeſſe was a long while without reply, and was intent only upon dreſſing her ſelfe; but ſeeing he offered to begin again, ſhe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted his ſpeech: <hi>Adraſtes,</hi> ſaid ſhe, all your language is to no purpoſe; and let me tell you this once for all, that I will neither love nor be loved; and unleſſe you will have me moſt abominably hate you, trouble me no more. Oh ye gods! (ſaid the ſhepheard) what diſmall doom is this? Then turning towards her: Is it poſſible, ſaid he unto her, that the gods ſhould be weary of being adored by mortalls, and that you ſhould be weary of being ſo by me? Nay, <hi>Adraſtes,</hi> ſaid ſhe, never wonder at it, for I am no goddeſſe; or if I were, any ſacrifice ſhould be more acceptable unto me than yours; and I had rather be without any temples or altars, then have ſuch adorers. Upon this laſt expreſſion, ſhe had done dreſſing her ſelfe, and therefore ſhe took up her ſheephook and went away, leaving this poor ſhepheard ſo ſadly afflicted, that he had not power or boldneſſe to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diana</hi> ſeeing her depart thus, ſhe had a minde to call upon her; but ſeeing alſo that ſhe went towards the other ſhepheard, ſhe thought it better to ſtay, and hear more: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the other ſhepheard ſeeing her comming towards him, he went to meet her, and held her by the gown, leſt ſhe ſhould go away; ſhe deſired to be out of his hands, but the ſhepheard preſently kneeled down, and begged pardon for his fault. It is not your fault only in thus holding me, that you ought to repent of, ſaid ſhe; but, ſhepheard, becauſe of that fault, which hath quite extinguiſhed all the good-will which I did bear unto you. As for that, anſwered he, in lieu of language, I will expiate it with my blood and life; but dare not beg, unleſſe in ſilence and ſubmiſſion, ſince indeed I do not well know what it is <hi>Palemon,</hi> replyed ſhe, there is none ſo ignorant, as he that will not know when he may: But that is all one to me, for I am ſo perfectly cured of the wound, that there is not any mark of it remaines. It is an eaſie matter, ſaid the ſhepheard to cure a wound that was but very ſmal. I will not tell you, anſwered ſhe, how it began to feſter, leſt I ſhould increaſe your vanity; but let me tell you, that I had rather die, then relapſe into that diſeaſe out of which I am recovered; and I had rather never ſee any whilſt I live, then ſee you in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and ſtate in which you were wont to be: Alſo, I charge you to talk no more of it, nor to retain me by any force. Since you are pleaſed, ſaid he, to forbid me ſpeaking; yet, I beſeech, permit me to ſing, what my heart does ſadly reſent. Then he ſighed, and ſung out theſe Verſes; which ſhe, to vex him, anſwered.</p>

               <p>Though <hi>Doris</hi> was very tart in all her anſwers, yet the ſhepheard did take ſome kinde of delight in ſeeing and hearing her talk, but ſhe, deſiring to avoid his company, ſhe came towards the place where <hi>Diana</hi> was, who ſeeing ſhe could not hide her ſelfe any longer, ſhe and her company advanced towards this ſhepheardeſſe, and after common ſalutations, ſaid unto her: I wonder not, ſweet <hi>Doris,</hi> that theſe ſhepheards whom I ſee with you, ſhould be ſo much captivated with your beauty, ſince it is ſuch, as thoſe muſt needs be blinde, that do not admire it; but, I muſt needs wonder at the cruelty you uſe towards them, ſince you are the only ſhe, who diſdaines that which is their own, and which you have gotten by ſuch fair and deer armes. Whilſt <hi>Diana</hi> was ſaying ſo, <hi>Palemon</hi> came to them, and heard <hi>Doris</hi> return this anſwer.</p>
               <p>Sage ſhepheardeſſe, that beauty, which out of your complaiſance you are pleaſed to call mine, is moſt really and truly your own, and to be admired by all ſuch as ſee you: And I do not know with what armes I have captivated theſe you ſpeak of unleſſe ſuch as are very unhappy in making ſuch a conqueſt. Beauty, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> does well become all women, but pride and preſumption does much eclipſe beauty. Did you know, anſwered <hi>Doris,</hi> the occaſion which makes me ſpeak thus, you would wonder at the power which I have over my ſelfe, in being able ſo much as to look upon this ſhepheard. Upon this, <hi>Palemon</hi> kneeled down, and with his hat in his hand, addreſſed himſelfe thus unto <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na:</hi> I do beſeech and conjure you, Oh moſt wiſe and diſcreet ſhepheardeſſe, by the perſon whom you moſt do love, and by that ſweetneſſe which your eyes do promiſe, to take ſo much pains as to hear our difference; if you ſhall think me culpable, I will not value my life; but if, on the contrary, ſhe be in the wrong I ſhall only aske leave to ſerve her as long as I live.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diana</hi> would have anſwered, when ſhe ſaw <hi>Aſtrea</hi> returning from the Temple, with a greater company than ſhe carried with her; for the Nymph <hi>Leonida</hi> was there, and <hi>Chryſante,</hi> the Governeſſe of the Druides, with ſome of the Virgins, who came to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Funeralls of <hi>Celadon,</hi> bringing with them the Prieſt of that place, who did officiate in the daily ſacrifice of the Town, in the Temple of the good goddeſſe. This Prieſt brought thither all that was neceſſary for the empty Tombe of <hi>Celadon;</hi> the Druides Daughters were loadned, ſome with flowers, others with milk, and others with wine and water, and did drive before them the ſheep and young bulls requiſite for the ſacrifice. <hi>Lyci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> alſo, being come that morning unto the Temple of the good goddeſſe, to pay ſome vowes, and make ſome prayers, which haply his jealouſie prompted him unto, he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe came, being acquainted with the deſigne of <hi>Paris,</hi> for the Reſt, of his Brothers ſoul, though it went to his heart to ſee <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Silvander</hi> there; and having made choice of a great Sowe to ſacrifice, according to the cuſtome, unto <hi>Ceres</hi> and the Earth, he gently followed after this Company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diana</hi> therefore ſeeing this great company following <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> ſhe could not give an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer either to the ſhepheard or ſhepheardeſſe, only this, that the Nymph <hi>Leonida,</hi> who was comming with ſo many Druides, would beglad to hear their difference; and after the Ceremony was ended, at which they would do an act of pitty, if they would be
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:53526:174"/>
preſent ſhe could compoſe all the buſineſſe betwixt them. So, not ſtaying for any anſwer, ſhe with <hi>Paris</hi> advanced, and went to ſalute the Nymph and <hi>Chryſante.</hi> After ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſcourſe, the Prieſt asked, where <hi>Celadon</hi>'s Tombe was erected, and being condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted thither by <hi>Paris,</hi> he went about his work: But firſt, he began with the Sowe which <hi>Lycidas</hi> brought, as a ſacrifice unto <hi>Ceres</hi> and the Earth; then killing the Sheep and young black Bulls, he kept the blood of them in bowles; he ordered the Druides Daughters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Ceremony, unto ſome he gave the ſacred Milke, unto others the Wine, and made choice of <hi>Lycidas</hi> to carry the Altar-water. Then going to the Tombe, he ſprinkled all theſe things with a little bough of Cypreſſe, calling divers times upon the ſoul of <hi>Celadon.</hi> Then they poured the Water, the Wine, the Milk, &amp; the Blood upon the Tomb, calling ſtill upon the ſoul of <hi>Celadon.</hi> Then all the Druides Daughters and others, with their hair diſheveled begun with tears &amp; ſad condolings to lament the loſs of <hi>Celadon:</hi> When they had continued a while in this pittifull office, the Prieſt began to go round about the Tomb three times, and every one following, &amp; ſtrewing Roſes and Flowers upon the graſs, he ſaid in a loud voice: <hi>Adieu, CELADON, adieu, for ever adieu; may thy ſoul reſt, and the earth be light upon thee.</hi> The Nymph <hi>Leonida</hi> did the like, ſtrewing Flowers upon the Tomb, though ſhe knew well enough he was not dead. <hi>Paris</hi> followed her, and all the ſhepheards and ſhepheardeſses in a file after him. Whilſt the Druides Daughters were ſinging this ſad Hymne, and lamenting the loſs of this ſhepheard, every one, according to the cuſtome told what they knew of his life and actions, how generally he was loved, how he honoured his Father and Mother, how affectionate he was unto all his Kindred, how often he had vanquiſhed all thoſe that contentended with him at any Exerciſe, uſuall amongſt ſhepheards, and how every one lamented his untimely death, as a great loſs unto all the Country. It was well for <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that all theſe ſhepheards and ſhepheardeſses went about <hi>Celadon's</hi> Tombe in a confuſed order, and bad eternall adieu unto him; for had ſhe gone by her ſelfe alone, ſhe had given them all a knowledge of her ſorrowes, which, being amongſt others, did not at all appear. Now all theſe Ceremonies being performed, there remained no more but the erecting this Pole, in reſemblance of a Columne, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating the place where <hi>Celadon</hi> dyed; which the Prieſt not knowing, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him, which was no ſmall renewing of her ſorrowes; this Column then being erected, there remained no more, then to fix upon it <hi>Celadon</hi>'s Epitaph, which <hi>Silvander</hi> had writ in a Table which the Prieſt had brought; for <hi>Hylas</hi> was not yet returned from fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Inke and Pen from the Temple of the goddeſs <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> The Epitaph and Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on which <hi>Silvandar</hi> writ, was this.</p>

<pb n="343" facs="tcp:53526:174"/>
your comming, theſe ſhepheards, offended againſt this ſhepheardeſs, would have referred their differences unto me; but I adviſed them to ſtay, untill this ceremony was ended, and then to addreſs themſelves unto you and the wiſe <hi>Chriſantes,</hi> if you would be pleaſed to take ſo much paines as to hear them, aſſuring my ſelfe, that the judgment which you two ſhould give, would be ſo juſt, as they would willingly be concluded by it. The Nymph, who was all civility, did lend a willing eare unto this ſhepheardeſs, and theſe two ſhepheards: <hi>Chriſante</hi> did the like, and when ſhe offered to ſpeak, <hi>Palemon</hi> and <hi>Adraſtes</hi> falling upon their knees, ſaid thus unto her: If any Lovers ever merited any pitty upon their paines, believe it, Madam, theſe two are they that may beſt claime it; ſo as you do an act worthy of your ſelfe, if you will be pleaſed to hear their difference, and to ordain, not as reaſon, but as love inſpires you; for it is only from Loves juſtice, and not from any other of the gods, that we expect or deſire reliefe. Truly, ſaid the Nymph, if you, fair ſhepheardeſs, do think, that the venerable <hi>Chriſante</hi> and my ſelfe, are able to hear and determine your differences, we ſhall be very glad to ſettle you all in tranquility, if we can. <hi>Doris,</hi> with a ſweet and reverend modeſty, anſwered thus: Great Nymph, theſe ſhepheards here, will but abuſe that favour which you do them, in hearing them, and do make unto you a ſupplication, which is very diſadvantageous unto themſelves, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting, that they know not what they ask for if you ſhould be pleaſed to take ſo much pains, as to hear us, you will diſcover the knavery and infidelity, and the ſoolery and troubleſomneſs of the other. However, Madam, ſince your goodneſs does infinitely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs our follies, I will refer unto the judgment of you and the reverent <hi>Chriſante,</hi> upon condition, that both they and I be obliged, to obey and abide whatſoever you ſhall doom. I do vow, ſaid <hi>Palemon,</hi> that I will rather diſobey the gods, then your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. And I, ſaid <hi>Adraſtes,</hi> do proteſt, that I will love you as long as I live, what doom ſoever be made to the contrary; but I do proteſt withall, by the holy <hi>Miſleto,</hi> that if I be doomed to quit you, you ſhall never be troubled with my affection. And by this you may know, that the affection of my Rivall is inferiour unto mine <hi>Adraſtes, Adraſtes,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Palemon</hi> then) you are much miſtaken, if you think, I will obey the doom of this great Nymph, if it command leſſe then the end of my life; ſo as you intending to live af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſentence, and I to die my paſſion being greater then yours, I am ſuperiour to you in true affection. <hi>Adraſtes</hi> faintly anſwered: Since you can ſo abſolutely diſpoſe of your life, and of your death, it argues, that you have a power over your ſelfe. But alas! my affection is ſo wholly Miſtreſſe of my will and ſoul, as it will not let me diſpoſe of my ſelfe ſo freely as you do.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Leonida</hi> had not interrupted them, they had not ſo ſoon ended their diſpute, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly deſirous they were to ſhew unto <hi>Doris</hi> the grandure of their love. But the Nymph, taking the venerable <hi>Chriſante</hi> by one hand, and <hi>Doris</hi> by the other: Let us (ſaid ſhe) finde out a place convenient for us to ſit down in, that we may with more eaſe hear the reaſons which each will alledge. Upon this, every ſhepheard took a ſhephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs by the hand; <hi>Tircis, Aſtrea; Paris, Diana;</hi> and <hi>Silvander,</hi> ſeeing his place taken up, and obſerving, how <hi>Lycidas</hi> looked aſquint upon <hi>Phillis,</hi> and would not come neer her, he reſolved to augment his miſery, ſince he was without any reaſon jealous of him; and therefore he addreſsed himſelfe unto <hi>Phillis,</hi> and would by all means take her hand: But ſhe, who obſerved the eye of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> turned away to avoid him, ſeeming as if ſhe went to call ſome of her companions. But for all that, <hi>Silvander</hi> was reſolute, and turned as well as ſhe. <hi>Phillis,</hi> durſt not publickly refuſe him, leſt thoſe who ſaw her ſhould take it ill; and not enduring he ſhould thus follow her, ſhe ſaid unto him: Do you think, <hi>Silvander,</hi> that I am at all obliged unto you, for being thus officious about me for want of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? <hi>Silvander</hi> knew very well why ſhe ſaid ſo, but, as if he were ignorant, he came to her eare, and ſeeming to whiſper, he preſently went away from her, and ſeemed very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry that <hi>Lycidas</hi> ſaw him. This went to the very heart of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> for he thought, that he left <hi>Phillis</hi> only becauſe of him, and that certainly there was a cloſe coreſpondency betwixt them; and therefore, not being able to endure this ſight, he endeavoured by little and little to retire.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Phillis</hi> being very deſirous to be reconciled unto him, and ſeeing him ſlinking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: <hi>Lycidas,</hi> ſaid ſhe, will you go away? I pray you come hither, and hear the diſcourſe of theſe ſtrangers. There is very good Company without me, anſwered he, ſince there is too much conſtraint where I am. Were I of your counſell, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> I would adviſe you to value your own contentment above any others. I ſee, ſaid <hi>Lycidas,</hi> that you give
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:53526:175"/>
me ſuch counſell as you do follow your ſelfe, and I am very ſorry I cannot do the like; but truly, I have not ſo much power over my ſelfe. <hi>Phillis</hi> did very well underſtand what he meant, and was netled to the very ſoul: yet, faigning otherwiſe, ſhe anſwered him thus: I believe, <hi>Lycidas,</hi> that if the Nymph ſhould undertake to agree all differences in the Company, you and I ſhould not be out of the number. I do believe the ſame (ſaid the ſhepheard, and bluſhed for anger) but it would be <hi>Silvander</hi> that were the fitteſt judge. And why <hi>Silvander,</hi> ſaid the ſhepheardeſs? Becauſe, ſaid he, there is none that is better informed. Upon this, not ſtaying for any anſwer, he flung away into the Wood as faſt as he could. This paſſage did ſo ſting the ſoul of <hi>Phillis,</hi> that one could not get a good word from her all that day.</p>
               <p>Whilſt <hi>Leonida</hi> and the venerable <hi>Chriſante</hi> were in queſt of a convenient place to ſit down in, they eſpied ſome ſhepheardeſſes in the Wood, comming towards them; for, the Trees being at a good diſtance from one another, without any underwood, one might ſee a great way, both through and beyond it. When <hi>Leonida</hi> asked who they were, none could tell her; but when they were a little neerer, <hi>Hylas,</hi> who was amongſt them, was known to be one; and preſently after, the ſhepheardeſses were alſo known to be <hi>Palinice</hi> and <hi>Florice,</hi> with whom <hi>Hylas</hi> met upon the way, and ſtayed with them, never thinking upon the Inke which he went to ſeek; and had they not asked him whither he went, and from whence he came, he had not remembered what he went about; but this queſtion putting him in memory, he deſired them to ſtay a little, till he went for the Inke, and he would return to them. Then he acquainted them with the Ceremony of <hi>Celadon</hi>'s Tombe, unto which they came to be aſſiſtants; but they came too late. <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nida</hi> not knowing who they were, ſhe deſired to ſee them. And <hi>Hylas,</hi> whoſe tongue was never mute, came on a jolly pace, ſinging theſe verſes.</p>

But, as I muſt not hope to change you, ſo you muſt not think to make me any other then what I am; and therefore, when I

would laugh, let me laugh, and let me be ſilent when I have no minde to talk, and I will allow your humours the like liberty; ſo in this freedome we ſhall live both contentedly, and without any trouble to one another: Oh Miſtreſſe, ſaid he, how dearly do I love you, nay, rather adore you, for this humour; I did never think to meet with ſuch a jolly one: And in ſaying ſo, he hugged her, and would have carried her in his armes, but ſhe would not let him. Every one laughed at the anger of <hi>Phillis,</hi> and the humour of this ſhepheard.

               <p>I Have ever been of opinion, great and wiſe Nymph, and you, venerable <hi>Chriſante,</hi> that if there be any obligations amongſt Mankinde, to tye one unto another, it is Amity: Whether this be ſo or no, I refer it unto the judgment of any who were ever loved. I being thus in this beliefe, after I had been long loved by this ſhepheard, I thought my ſelfe in ſome ſort obliged, to render him amity for amity. The truth is, this amity at the firſt, had but a very ſlender and faint beginning, and I could not imagine, it ſhould ever grow into that magnitude it did; it did inſenſibly take ſo deep a root by long continued converſation, as when I perceived it, I found it was not in my power to root it out; and ſo, as I never queſtioned his affection, nor could he deſire any thing of me, which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained not, atleaſt, in any reaſon. Yet notwithſtanding, I know not how, to my miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, when he was in full aſſurance of me, he did even then miſtruſt me, ſo as he was not contented, I ſhould leave frequenting all thoſe whom I was accuſtomed to ſee, but would needs have others deprived of ſeeing me; ſo as not being contented with my not viſiting any of my Companions, but if any of them came to ſee me, it was a thing intolerable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
               <p>Have I not all the reaſon in the world to be offended at him, for this bad opinion of me, which his jealouſie hath infuſed into him? For gods-ſake judge, into what extream tyranny is his amity changed: Yet nevertheleſſe, rather then diſpleaſe him, I choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to loſe the good-will of all my friends, neighbours, and acquaintance, rather then he ſhould receive any dis-ſatisfaction from me. God knowes, in what a ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint I lived; and though I did ſtrive to be as agreeable to his humour as I could, and to content him, and though it was pleaſing to me ſo to do; yet, my ſtrange retiredneſſe from all ſhepheards and ſhepheardeſſes, from all my friends and acquaintance, as if I were ſick of ſome infectious diſeaſe, was extreamly hard unto me. If this jealouſie of his did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from his affection unto me, was not he as much obliged to do as much for me, as he conſtrained me to do for him? But he was ſo far from that, as during all this time, which I may well terme a ſalvage life, (for truly ſo was mine become, only to be ſuitable unto his humour) he would not viſit me above halfe a quarter of an houre in a day, viſits ſo ſhort, as I could do no more then ſee him, but hardly ſpeak one word unto him. Judge; I beſeech you, whether I have not good reaſon to ſay, that his affection is turned into tyranny, ſince he was growne like unto thoſe, who at the firſt, under a colour of good husbandry, do afterwards grow ſo niggardly, both unto themſelves, and thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon them, as they will not allow a ſufficient competency to live upon. For, I do believe, his life was no more pleaſing unto him, then mine unto me, unleſſe in this, that his was voluntary, and mine conſtrained. But ſee, whether I was not very good unto him, and loved him very well: I endured all his tyranny without the leaſt murmur; and had not he himſelfe releaſed me, I my ſelfe never had. The laſt teſtimony which I gave him of my obedience (for ſo I may phraſe it, better then affection) was ſuch, as was enough to qualifie all his perverſe and odd humours.</p>
               <p>Be pleaſed to know, great Nymph, that I lived very young without Father or Mother, under the tuition of a Brother, who being elder then I, was ever ſo affectionate
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:53526:176"/>
and indulgent towards me, as he did very well ſupply the want of Father, both in the education of my Perſon, and management of my Eſtate, and abundantly officious, in doing me the offices of a very Father. He being thus good unto me, common reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides other conſiderations, commanded me, to conform my ſelfe unto his will, as much as poſſibly I could, and contrary him in nothing. <hi>Palemon,</hi> without any conſideration of all this, would needs have me abſolutely to break off from him; not that I ſhould go out of his houſe, for he knew not whither elſe I could go, but that I ſhould not have any coreſpondency with thoſe whom he loved; nay that I ſhould forbid them the ſight of me. Thoſe who live under the authority of another, do know, whether this be feaſable or no. Yet, to let him ſee, how ready I was, to give him any teſtimony of my affection, I did attempt to give him ſatisfaction in this. My Brother, amongſt the reſt of his neighbours, did love a ſhepheard whoſe name was <hi>Panteſmon,</hi> a man, truly, who was qualified with all good conditions to render him amiable and pleaſing; he was wiſe, civill, reſpective, affable, couragious, and a good friend, and amongſt ſhepheardeſſes, he was the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet in all the Town. Theſe qualities did invite my Brother to love him, and there grew ſo greet a familiarity between them, that they were never aſſunder. Now I muſt needs confeſſe, that as he loved my Brother very well, yet I know not, whether he obſerved any thing in me which pleaſed him, or whether it was, that he bore good will unto the Siſter for the Brothers ſake; yet ſo it was, that I knew he loved me. Now you ſhall ſee, whether I did not behave my ſelfe as I ought to do with <hi>Palemon:</hi> As ſoon as ever I knew this, I told him of it, and related unto him all paſſages, and all the demonſtrations of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which I obſerved in him. If I had had any deſignes, you may imagine, I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have done thus. Oh heavens! what reverence, what honour, and what ſubmiſſion did this ſhepheard render unto me? His merits and affection were ſo worthy of all entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, together with my Brother's friendſhip, that as I did underſtand ſince, he did intend to marry us together. But I, notwithſtanding the relation of a Brother's friend, did receive his addreſſes with more ſaintneſſe, then any other: For knowing he loved me, I thought it an injury unto the affection of <hi>Palemon,</hi> if I gave him any countenance, though civility in any other might have done it without offence. This was the man, whom <hi>Palemon</hi> charged me not to ſee. And how do you think it was poſſible for me to obey him? <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſmon</hi> had a greater deſire to obey me, then <hi>Palemon</hi> had reaſon for his requeſt; for, how could I give him ſatisfaction? which way ſhould I forbid him my Brothers houſe, who perhaps loved him better then he loved me? However, I took <hi>Panteſmon</hi> aſide, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with my will. I will manifeſt my affection unto you, ſaid he, not only by the effects of my affection, but alſo by the effects of your hatred: You are pleaſed, without any re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If you could have any hopes in me, you had the more reaſon to be angry; but ſince you cannot, what pleaſure can you take, in rendring me miſerable by loving me, without any hopes, but in my diſpleaſure? You need not uſe any more words to perſwade me (anſwered he; my affection, which is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devoted unto your will, prompts me unto more then you can ſay: I ſhall, untill the very laſt minute of my life, do whatſoever you ſhall command me, without any other aime, end, or deſigne, but only to obey you. Yet, if my affection, my ſervices, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, can merit ſo great a favour, I ſhall beſeech and conjure you, by him you love moſt, and who perhaps is the cauſe of my baniſhment, that when I bid you my laſt and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall adieu, you will permit me ſo much honour, as to aſpire unto a kiſſe of your lip. I cannot chuſe, Oh great Nymph, but bluſh in my relation: But however, I muſt confeſſe the truth, I did permit him, conceiving, that his goodneſs did oblige me unto as much. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after, he departed, and I never found him ſince in any place, where it was probable I ſhould ſee him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:53526:176"/>
Now, I beſeech you, were not all theſe teſtimonies of my affection enough, to oblige this ungratefull ſhepheard for ever unto one? But I found him quite contrary; for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, he would never ſee me, neither in the way of a Lover, no, nor ſo much as in the way of a Friend. I much deſired to know the cauſe of his retreat, and therefore I did em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy a faithfull friend to go unto him from me: But no other anſwer could be gotten, but this, that, <hi>Love drives out Love, as one naile dxives out another.</hi> Upon this, I had two conceptions: Firſt, that he was fallen in love with ſome other ſhepheardeſſe, and this ſecond love had driven out the firſt unto me. Secondly, that by his ſleighting of me, he gave me counſell to do the ſame. Being thus abandoned and forſaken, though it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly requiſitie to uſe my beſt armes againſt ſuch an accident, yet would I not make uſe of any ſuch, as my enemy ſent me; for ſcorning them as his, I thought them unworthy of my ſelfe, and I eſteemed them perfidious, becauſe I eſteemed their Inventor ſo. I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe therefore unto other remedies, which, though more ſlow, yet more certain in their effects, which was, Time: Time, I ſay, was my Armes, and it which taught me the uſe of them; it was both my Phyſician and my Phyſick. And truly, as moſt things that are ſlow, are yet moſt ſure, ſo the cure it wrought, was through; not for a day, but I thank god, for all the reſt of my life. I ſay, I do thank god, for indeed I had abundance of reaſon; for great Nymph, when I call into my memory the life I lived, as long as this perfidious man ſeemed to love me, and compare it with that which I do live now, I muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that I am more obliged unto him for betraying me, then I am unto <hi>Panteſmon</hi> for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying me For then, (I cannot call it a life, but a ſlavery) my affection was not affection, but obedience; and his love was not love, but tyranny. Now this diſloyall man, being (as I believe) envious at my happy life, or elſe not contented with once triumphing, he muſt needs make a ſecond attempt: And, as at the firſt, he ſurpriſed me by ſubmiſſion, and great demonſtrations of a violent affection, ſo he thinks now to catch me with the ſame bait: And therefore, Oh great and wiſe Nymph, you ſee him here on his knees before me, uſing ſuch language and expreſſions, as they do who are really in love. But he does not conſider, that finding my ſelfe weakeſt on that ſide, I have more ſtrongly fortified it: I am fully reſolved to hold him out at armed end, let him attempt as long as he will; his diſſimulations, in lieu of love, have renewed ſuch extream diſdain of him in my ſoul, that I cannot endure the very ſight of him: And if his deſigne was to diſpleaſe me, I muſt needs confeſs, he hath brought it to paſſe; but if that be not his deſigne, (as he ſwears, and would make me believe, it is not) but that, as a juſt puniſhment from heaven, he hath revived his flame, that he himſelfe was the only author of his own misfortune, and that he is prepared for puniſhment; I muſt then confeſſe, that in giving me this occaſion of revenge upon the wrong he hath done me, he is a juſt man, but ſtill no good Lover. But yet, why does he tell me of his misfortunes and miſeries? me, I ſay, who would not ſo much as remember that he is in the world. Or why does he take up ſuch Armes, as thinking to hurt me with them, he wounds himſelfe? He cannot ever have any hopes to obtain any thing from me, whoſe ſoul ſmarts with the memory of what is paſt, as oft as I look upon him. Let him therefore let me alone, and leave me, to enjoy that happineſſe which he conferred upon me by a contrary deſigne. If the heavens, as often they do, have converted that unto my happineſſe, which he prepared for my miſery, why is he ſorry I ſhould enjoy it? I know better how to make uſe of theſe favours from heaven, then he hath of thoſe, which I have done him heretofore. Let him acknowledge and confeſſe, that the heavens have moſt juſtly maintained my cauſe, and defended my innocent affection againſt the moſt ungratefull and perfidious perſon, that ever pretended to be a Lover. If, like a loſing gameſter, he ask any thing for his laſt hand, this, great and wiſe Nymph, is all I can do for him; I will confeſſe my ſelfe ſatisfied for his ingratitude, and forgive it; I will pitty him, upon condition, he will never ſee me, nor trouble me any more; and this ſhall be all the revenge I will take, for all his injuries.</p>
               <p>Thus the ſhepheardeſſe ended, with ſo much colour in her face, as rendred her fairer then ſhe was wont to be. Then <hi>Leonida</hi> perceiving, ſhe had no more to ſay, ſhe commanded <hi>Palemon</hi> to ſpeak, what he had to ſay for himſelfe. Then the ſhepheard riſing up, after an humble reverence unto the Nymph, he began thus.</p>

                              </gap> me undeceived, and convinced of that errour wherein I have long lived, if I can call that a life, which hath brought me more torments then death it ſelfe. I do moſt ingenuouſly confeſſe, all that this fair ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe hath related unto you, is moſt true, and that I am infinitely more obliged unto her then either ſhe or I can expreſſe. But having heard her reproach me, for complaining, that the heavens, as envious of my bliſſe, hath kept me from it, I ſhould think this to be a greater occaſion of ſorrow, and to accuſe it of injuſtice, did I not know, that all men are in the like condition, and that there is no perfect contentment here below. I cannot chuſe but beg leave to grieve, for the wrong this fair ſhepheardeſſe hath done unto that affection, which ſhe hath promiſed me, by miſinterpreting mine, and taking that for an injury, which ſhe ought to take for the greateſt aſſurance and demonſtration of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. But, Oh great god of Love! how dare I complain againſt her, ſince thou haſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to think all well that ſhe doth? I will therefore uſe no complaints againſt her, for my heart will not give me leave to contradict her in any thing. But, Oh wiſe Nymph, I will endeavour to let you ſee, by telling the truth, that <hi>Palemon</hi> doth love, and that <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> has no reaſon to believe the contrary. And, to be as briefe as I can, ſhe does confeſſe, that I did love her, and that ſhe did love me; but why does ſhe upbraid me with any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity? Her reaſon is, becauſe I was jealous, and I confeſſe I was. But if ſhe did love me as ſhe ſaies ſhe did, for loving her, why ſhould my affection be pleaſing to her, and not the effects of my affection? If all that looked upon her, made me jealous, if their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, their words, nay, their very lookes, made me ſuſpitious, was not this a moſt certain teſtimony, that I did infinitely love her? She hath often told me, that to doubt of her, was to offend her, and to make a ſiniſter conſtruction of her. Ah great Nymph, did this fair ſhepheardeſſe know as well how to love, as her eyes do to make her adored, ſhe would ſay, that this was rather extream love, and the high opinion of her, which made me doubt her. Had I not thought her moſt worthy to be ſerved by every one, I ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have thought, that every one had ſerved her. And had I not been of that beliefe, how could I have been jealous of every one? Jealouſie therefore, Oh fair <hi>Doris,</hi> is not a leſſer ſigne of affection and violent love, then ſighes and tears are; for, it hath its originall from the knowledge one hath of the perfections in the perſon loved; but ſighes and tears do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten proceed from her cruelty only, and from the torments which they reſent by reaſon thereof. She therefore knowing, (Oh great Nymph) that I was jealous, ought ſhe not therefore to encreaſe her affection, in ſome ſort to ballance the weight which mine endured? but on the contrary, ſhe rewards me with cruelty, ſhe her ſelfe unties the knot of that amity, which ſo many ſervices and demonſtrations of a perfect affection, ought to have made indiſſolvable. And to give ſome colourable pretence for all this, ſhe alledgeth faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and coldneſs on my ſide, and negligence and careleſſeneſſe, which, alas, was only in her own opinion. She alledgeth, that at that time, I abſented my ſelfe from her. Indeed, when I conſider this allegation, I muſt confeſſe, that all actions may be ſuſpected, when the effects produce contrary ſemblances, or are not known unto thoſe, that have intereſt in them. If I ſhould ask you, fair <hi>Doris,</hi> what opinion you had of me, when my fortune had brought me into your acquaintance, I am confident you will ſay, that I loved ſerved, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and adored you, with as much faithfull zeal of true affection, as ever any ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard could. And let it not diſpleaſe you, if before this great Nymph and reverent Druide, I beſeech and conjure you to tell them, who that ſhepheardeſſe is, that ever I adreſſed my ſelfe unto, except you; or you ever heard of? If you do not know, nor ever heard of any, but muſt needs confeſſe, my affection was never placed any where elſe, why do you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of me? and why ſhould you ſuſpect, and put a miſinterpretation upon my actions? Me-thinks it is but very ill Logick, to conclude, that <hi>Palemon</hi> did love me; but becauſe he ſees me not ſo oft as he was wont, therefore he does not love me. Were it not a better piece of ſophiſtry in the Schooles of Love, to argue thus? <hi>Palemon</hi> does not ſee me ſo oft as he was accuſtomed, but I know there is ſome urgent occaſions which keeps him away. Had you been thus compaſſionate upon the torments I endured, in being abſent from you,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:53526:177"/>
and judged others by your ſelfe, you had never ſo cruelly offended him, who did never offend againſt the affection which he promiſed. But perhaps you will ask me, what I did mean by ſo many minute viſits, whereas formerly whole daies would not content me? I ſhall tell you, Oh ſage Nymph; and when you have heard me, you will not make ſuch a ſiniſter conſtruction of my actions, as this fair one doth of my fidelity; only I beſeech you to conſider, the kinde of life which I led at that time, and amongſt what company I lived. I can, and truly, ſay, Oh great Nymph, that never man lived a more ſalvage life then I; no, not ſuch, whoſe profeſſion is to inhabit amongſt Rocks and Deſarts, excepting only, when my affection conſtrained me once a day to ſee her; for, as ſoon as day began to dawn, I went out of my Cabin, and ſhunning all manner of company, I did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn untill dark night, retiring my ſelfe, ſometimes into the moſt cloſe and unfrequented Caves, and other times upon the tops of the higheſt Mountains, ſo ſolitarily alone, as nothing but my own thoughts could finde me out; but they ſtill kept me ſo good company, as they did often invite me unto ſome ſuch place, from whence I might ſee her habitation, thinking the very ſight of the happy walls where ſhe dwelt, to be no ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation unto me. Nothing could withdraw me from this kinde of ſolitary life; no, not the friendſhip of Neighbours, nor duty to Parents, nor care of my Flocks, nor any thing in the world elſe, but only my deſire of ſeeing her every day once, and that in ſuch ſhort viſits, as, to my ſorrow alwaies when I returned, I thought I did but only go thither, and not ſee her. Now my extream affection unto her was the cauſe, why I did not acquaint her with my reaſon for this kinde of life.</p>
                           <p>Now, great and wiſe Nymph, it was ever my opinion, that he who loves as he ought to do, ought to be more tender of her honour whom he loves, then of his own content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The malice of ill diſpoſed men is never ſo weak nor drouſie, but it may alwaies finde out ſome ſubject to aſperſe thoſe that are moſt vertuous: And at this time, our frequent viſits were eyed, and gave occaſion unto thoſe malignant ſpirits, to ſpit their venome, and talk very broadly; and yet, ſo cloſely, that all the diligence I could uſe could never bring me to know, who were the authors of theſe poyſonous Impoſtures. What ſhould I do in ſuch a caſe? To undertake a long voyage, I could not, becauſe I was not a free Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of my own actions; and to ceaſe to love her, had been to ceaſe to live. Since our great familiarity was it, which gave a colour for their calumny, what could I better do, then ſtop the black mouthes of ſcandall, by abridging my ſelfe of my own content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in not being ſo frequently with her? For, I thought my ſelfe obliged to preſerve her honour and reputation, at any rate whatſoever. If ſhe complain, that I did not acquaint her with this untill now, ſhe may as well complain againſt my extream love of her; for, the reaſon why I did not impart it unto her, was, becauſe I was loath to make her a part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in my ſorrowes; for I know, that ſhe, who was ever ſo carefull to keep her honour free from all calumny, could not endure to hear of theſe, without extream vexation, and ſad reſentment.</p>
                           <p>Now, great Nymph, I beſeech you to conſider, by this moſt true relation, whether ſuch effects are uſuall amongſt vulgar affections, and from thence you may perceive the quality of mine; and being ſuch, as gives a manifeſt proof of its grandure, why may I not, and with reaſon, aske as well ſome proofes of hers, ſince love is never requited but with love again. As for the buſineſſe of <hi>Panteſmon,</hi> which ſhe alledgeth as a great matter of complaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, I conceive, my apprehenſions of him did not proceed from an ill grounded jealouſie, as ſhe termes it, but from abundance of reaſon; for this ſhepheard, as ſhe her ſelfe confeſſeth, being ſuch a one as he is, it was probable, ſhe would rather love him then ſcorn him. Moreover, the friendſhip betwixt her Brother and him, was no ſmall ground for my ſuſpitions; but eſpecially, the favourable eye which ſhe caſt upon him, which indeed was ſuch, as knowing of my jealouſie, ſhe was more to be blamed, for behaving her ſelfe ſo, then I, for thinking ſo: And indeed, their Marriage was openly ſpoken of, ſo as from hence I had ſtrong grounds for jealouſie; and ſhe, to cleer her ſelfe, had good reaſon to do as I requeſted. If friendſhip have a priviledge above love, ſhe might well have denyed my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; if it have not, why ſhould ſhe think it ſtrange, my love ſhould deſire a preheminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy above that amity, which ſhe had unto her Brother?</p>
                           <p>From hence it was, great Nymph, that all our miſeries had their originall; for when I was angry with her, for the countenance which ſhe gave unto this ſhepheard; ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered me, that her Brothers affection unto him was the cauſe of it. But when I replyed, that the report of her Marriage unto him was ſo common, as it was impoſſible I could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:53526:178"/>
to hear it: What would your fantaſticall ſuſpicion (anſwered ſhe, with an angry look) have me to do? You may call it what you pleaſe, (ſaid I unto her) but I ſhall never be at reſt, untill I ſee him baniſhed from you. Well, (ſaid ſhe, with a more angry eye) I will give you ſatisfaction this time; but I wiſh this may be the laſt of your odd humours. ſhe expreſſed her ſelfe in ſuch a manner, as made me more ſuſpect her, then if ſhe had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed me with ſome handſome excuſe. This made me reſolve to look more narrowly into the matter, and truſt unto no eyes but my own. Oh moſt unhappy diffidence! Oh what an abominable reſolution was this, which hath coſt ſo much ſorrow, ſuch extream tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo many tears? In order therefore unto this deſigne, I ſpied out a time, when <hi>Panteſmon</hi> went unto her Chamber; for, as fortune was, either for diſpleaſure, or for ſome ill diſpoſedneſſe, ſhe kept her bed that day: And going up a back pair of ſtaires, which conducted to her Lodgings, I came through a Lobby into a little Cloſet, which had a dore over againſt her bed. Such was my misfortune, as I could, through the key-hole, ſee all they did, but being at too far a diſtance, I could not hear one word.</p>
                           <p>I ſaw, and too plainly for my contentment, this ſhepheard ſit by her bed-ſide; I ſaw him take her hand, and kiſſe it ſeveral times; I ſaw him talk bare-headed, and at laſt, kiſſe her lip, without any reſiſtance; and for ought I could obſerve, ſhe anſwered him with no words of anger. Oh heavens! what a dagger was this to my heart? I knew not what to do with my ſelfe; I knew not how I ſhould ſuffer this and live. But, ſuch was my extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary affection unto her, that though I had theſe bitter reſentments, yet it made me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to endure any thing, which I thought pleaſing unto her. <hi>Panteſmon</hi> went away, and I alſo; he, very ill ſatisfied with me; and I, abſolutely mad at him. Thus did Love drive us both away.</p>
                           <p>Now, I beſeech you, great Nymph, tell me: Would you have thought I had loved her, had not this gone to my very ſoul? Could my reſentment be leſſe, then to retire my ſelfe? or, Could it be carried with more diſcretion, then never to ſpeak of it unto any? I do confeſſe, I did endeavour to regain my liberty; and when I found abundance of difficulty, in unlooſing the cords wherewith ſhe held me, I ſaid ſeverall times to my ſelfe, That I would cut thoſe I could not untie. And when I was thus ſtriving with my ſelfe, it is true, ſhe ſent one of her friends unto me. But what could I think of her meſſage more, then that it was a continuation of her deluſions? Could I poſſibly give the lye unto ſuch dear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, as my own Eyes? So, being full of anger, I made that anſwer which ſhe thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines of, which was, <hi>That one Nail drives out another.</hi> Now, ſince I had a beliefe, that ſhe had thus ungratefully betrayed me, how could I give her a milder check? I was obliged unto as much by the Lawes of my affection, which would not let me lie now, no more then before. If ſhe took it in any other ſenſe then I intended it, her innocence was the cauſe of it, and my error made me ſay ſo. She does not know of any other Love, that ever driv my love of her out of my heart; and yet, my fears of diſpleaſing her, hath even untill this time, deprived me of my greateſt contentment. When I at any time reſolved to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid her for all this, Love, which had ever a great prevalence in my ſoul, reſtrained me, and gave me a check, telling me, that this would too much offend her, whom I once lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo well; that it was not handſome to twit her with her faults, and make her aſhamed of them; but that I ſhould be well contented, with being looſe from thoſe perfidious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, in which I had been ſo long entangled. Oh! this advice was moſt pernicious unto me; for doubtleſſe, had I at the firſt told her what I had ſeen, ſhe would have related unto me all that ſhe had done; and ſo I ſhould have received as much ſatisfaction, happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and contentment, as I have ſince ſuffered torments and miſeries. But abſenting my ſelfe wholly from her, it was long before I knew, that <hi>Panteſmon</hi> had left her: And the worſt was, I durſt not ſo much as enquire, leſt I ſhould hear ſomething, which would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe my griefe. At laſt, my love being ſtronger then my reſolution or my anger, I did by degrees go neer her, and at the very firſt ſight, forgetting all the wrongs which, as I thought, I had received, I applyed my ſelfe more unto her then ever before. But how did I finde her? ſhe had the ſame eyes, the ſame mouth, and the ſame beauty; but ſhe was not the ſame <hi>Doris,</hi> who, when I left her, loved none but <hi>Palemon,</hi> eſteemed none but <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and carraſſed none but <hi>Palemon.</hi> At this ſad return, I ſaw nothing but diſdain, found nothing but hatred and reſented nothing but rigour and anger; ſo as untill very now, it was impoſſible for me to let her know, the cauſe of my retirement, becauſe ſhe would never let me tell her, but ſtill interrupted my ſpeech.</p>
                           <p>Now, Oh great Nymph, if theſe things be not teſtimonies of a moſt faithfull and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:53526:178"/>
love, I will not deſire her favour; though the favour which I ask, is not a pardon of any fault committed againſt love, but only, for loving her too much, perhaps more then ſhe would have me, or more then ſhe believes. If Love would let me complain againſt her, as in reaſon I may, I ſhould tell her, that the hath done abundance of wrong, both unto Love, unto <hi>Doris,</hi> and unto <hi>Palemon:</hi> For, Love may complain, that ſhe hath extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed that fire, which blazed with ſo pure a flame, that Vertue it ſelfe could not be offended with its heat; and in lieu of it, ſhe has kindled flames of anger and ſpleen, ſo ſmothered with black ſmoak, that in lieu of enlightning her ſoul, they fill it full of darkneſſe and confuſion. But <hi>Doris</hi> has greater reaſon of compliant, that ſo ſleight a ground ſhould make her perjured, and break ſo many reiterated Oathes, ſworn unto that unfortunate ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, never to change her minde. And what can ſhe anſwer <hi>Palemon,</hi> if he ſhould ſay unto her: Is it poſſible, unthankfull ſhepheardeſſe, that ſo many years ſervice, ſo many teſtimonies of affection, ſo many aſſurances of my fidelity, ſhould not make you have a better conceipt of me? 'Tis true, I was jealous; but was it not a fruit of Love? I beſeech you, why not jealous, if amorous? Who ſhould I be jealous of, but of her I love? But, admit it be a fault, and ought to be puniſhed; is it not the rigour of juſtice, to equall the puniſhment to the crime? But admit, that it ought to equall it, and that an eye for an eye, and an arme for an arme, ought to expiate the ſin; yet, why ſhould you puniſh me for being jealous of you? for then, the ſame puniſhment ought to be inflicted upon you, ſince you were alſo jealous of me. Is this an act glorious, and worthy of a Lover? But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you will ſay unto me, You caſt me off, and quitted me, and has therefore rendred your ſelfe unworthy of any favour. Well, ſuppoſe I did caſt you off; you muſt therefore caſt me off alſo; and perhaps you have done it already. Suppoſe us to be both upon equall tearmes, I have caſt you off, and you have caſt me off. But now, when I return again, with abundance of repentance and ſorrow for what is paſt; are not you obliged by the Law of Like, to do the like? Here I am upon my knees before you, with as many bitter tears of repentance, as ever Lover had; and can your anger extend ſo far, as not to re-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me into my former happineſſe. Forgiveneſſe is the greateſt glory of the gods, and it has this operation, that it converts the greateſt offenders into the greateſt lovers.</p>

                  <hi>The Hiſtory of the Shepheard</hi> Adraſtes.</head>
               <p>I Beſeech you, great and puiſſant Nymph, and you, venerable <hi>Chriſante,</hi> to ſtay your judgment, untill you have heard me, that you may have the better conuſance of our differences, and be able to put a juſt concluſion unto all our miſeries and inquietudes. I have loved this ſhepheardeſſe, even from her very Cradle; I have never ſince ceaſed loving her, but ſtill encreaſed in my deſires to do her ſervice: I have endured all her diſdaines, and patiently ſuffered her, to place all her affection upon another, before my face. Length of time has not leſſened my love, nor diverted my deſigne; her rigours could never afright me, and yet hitherto, I could never make her leave the leaſt of her cruelties. She equally ballanced her ſelfe with favours unto <hi>Palemon,</hi> and disfavours unto me, and ever moſt cruelly ſcorned both my love and patience. But all was one, all her affronts did but the better enure me, to endure the intolerable burthen of them; they were ſo far from diverting me from her ſervice, that the more difficulties and miſeries I met with, the more did they confirme the violence of my love. Oh heavens! can any man, infected with this diſeaſe, be wiſe? Can he look for any cure, when his will cannot conſent unto it? All ſuch as give me any counſell againſt Love, are my declared enemies; and though all manner of hopes were blaſted, yet my affection was unalterable, it was never in the leaſt degree ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or leſſened. No, great Nymph, I had rather die, then diminiſh the leaſt ſpark of that flame, which burned me. She has ſeen me ſeverall times ſwim in tears before her; ſhe has ſeen me fall at her feet, out of my wits. But neither my tears, nor danger of my life, could ever obtain any thing from her, but ſcorn and mockery: A juſt reſentment whereof had been revenged upon <hi>Palemon,</hi> if my love could have conſented unto any thing, that might diſpleaſe this cruell one. But this paſſion of revenge was ſo unable to make me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake ſuch a deſigne, as I am ſure, ſhe cannot taske me with the leaſt blemiſh in my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and whatſoever ſhe is pleaſed to ſay of me, I may truly, without any oſtentation,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:53526:179"/>
give my ſelfe the name of, <hi>A Lover without a fault;</hi> for jealouſie could never finde any harbour in my ſoul, as it did in this too happy ſhepheard; nor did I ever think any ill, or finde any fault with any of her actions. Love can be my witneſſe, that even her very rigours were welcome to me, when I conſidered, that they were pleaſing unto this fair <hi>Doris.</hi> And though I am not ſo far out of Fortunes favour, but any other ſhepheardeſſe would perhaps look upon me with a favourable eye; yet moſt certain I am, that I never profeſſed any fidelity to them, but abundance unto her. But Love, not to let ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain go unpuniſhed, and not to forſake a Love ſo pure as mine, hath ſuffered her to reſent the bitterneſſe of diſdain, by the divorce betwixt her and this ſhepheard. But before <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ever loved her, I did; yet, for all her bitter treatment, ſhe never ſaw the leaſt altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in me. I was the firſt that ſerved her, I am the only one that has continued conſtant, and ſhall be for ever in the ſame minde. I do not ſet theſe things before her eyes by way of reproach, but for truthes-ſake only; yet ſuch truths, as ſhall not put her unto any ſad remembrances, for ſo I muſt needs phraſe my paſt ſervices. And though her cruelty hath been ſuch unto me, yet muſt I in ſome ſort excuſe her, ſince being engaged unto <hi>Palemon,</hi> perhaps ſhe had offended againſt her fidelity, in doing otherwiſe. But now, when, thanks be to the Fates, ſhe hath quitted him, what reaſon or colour can ſhe have for her cruelty, ſince ſhe tells you, that ſhe loved <hi>Palemon,</hi> becauſe ſhe thought it reaſonable, to love him who loved her. Upon her own ground, reaſon, and judgment, I do appeal unto you, great Nymph, ſwearing unto you by her fair ſelfe, for a greater oath cannot be, that never did any Beauty cauſe a greater, more ſincere, or more faithfull love, then that of <hi>Adraſtes</hi> unto the fair <hi>Doris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Adraſtes</hi> ended his Oration, with ſo many demonſtrations of a perfect love, as all that heard him were partners in his reſentments. And the ſhepheardeſſe <hi>Doris,</hi> ſeeing he had ſaid all he could, after an humble reverence, anſwered thus.</p>
               <p>Great Nymph, I am very ſorry for this ſhepheard's ſake, that all he hath ſaid is true; for, ſince he loves me ſo well, it grieves me, that he ſhould be ill treated; yet, you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by what hath been ſaid, that the fault is not in me, but it is himſelfe only, that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues his ill fortune. The firſt time he declared his minde unto me, we were both ſo young, that neither knew what Love was; ſo as what he ſaid unto me, moved me no more, then a perſon who was nothing at all concerned. Afterwards, he travelled, and when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, he found me not mine own, for I had given my ſelf unto <hi>Palemon:</hi> So that, as at the firſt time, he might complain of my ignorance in love; ſo at this ſecond, he might much more complain of my too much knowledge in it. But he has no reaſon at all to complain againſt me; for, ſhepheard, can you complain againſt me, who was not capable of love, for not loving you? Lay the blame upon Nature; accuſe thoſe Lawes unto which ſhe hath ſubmitted us all. Then, can you think it ſtrange, I will not love you, when my will was not my owne? Alas, I have but one heart, and one ſoul, and one will. You may with more reaſon complain, (and that me-thinks is the only plea you have) that you did addreſſe your ſelfe unto me too ſoon, and returned too late. You ſay that I never looked upon you, but with ſcorn, but was ever very averſe from ſhewing any favour unto you. Truly, <hi>Adraſtes,</hi> if you rightly interpret my actions, you will finde, that you are more obliged unto me for that, then if I had done otherwiſe For, had you received any ſatisfaction from me, unto what a ſtrange extremity would your love have been driven, that was ſo great, maugre all my rigours? Conſider, <hi>Adraſtes,</hi> that favours from me, would rather have been aggravations, then any conſolations in your miſery: Beſides, I could not have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, without much offence unto that ſincere affection, which I had promiſed <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> I muſt needs confeſſe, that it is juſt to love one that loves us; but I do not ſay, it is injuſtice, not to love all thoſe, that have any affection unto us; for if it were, there would be no fidelity nor aſſurance in love; if it were ſo, you your ſelfe were obliged, to render a reciprocall love unto the ſhepheardeſſe. <hi>Bebliena,</hi> who is ready to die for you. But I mean, that a woman being free from all other affection, may, without blame, love him that loves her, if there be no other reaſon of hatred, but his love. Now this caſe is nothing reſemblant unto that betwixt you and me; for I being engaged another way, I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract any new affection with you, without a ruine of that which I have contracted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. Had I diſſembled with you, or held you in hopes with any ſmooth language, you might with reaſon complain againſt me; but, if I did ever tell you my minde plainly and freely, are you not obliged unto me for it? Have I not a thouſand times over entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, conjured, nay, commanded, as far as I had any power over you, that you ſhould
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:53526:179"/>
extinguiſh your affection to me? And have you not alwaies anſwered me, that you would, if you could do it and live? And when you did continue on was it not for your own ſake, and not mine? But, great Nymph, ſee how that which, as I gather from his word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, he thinks to be his advantage, does deceive him. Doubtleſſe he thinks, that my affection unto <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon</hi> was the only cauſe, which kept me from giving entertainment unto his. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he no ſooner heard of the diſſentions betwixt that ſhepheard and me, but preſently he was blowne up with hopes to effectuate his deſires; and, to loſe no occaſions of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting them, he hath ever ſince that time ſo importunately preſſed me, that I may, and with reaſon, call him, rather my enemy then my friend. But he is much deceived in theſe thoughts, and does not conſider, that if ever this affection of mine do ceaſe, I ſhall with it ſo ceaſe from ever any other love, as I ſhall never reſent any effects of it again.</p>
               <p>Thus ended <hi>Doris. Adraſtes</hi> would have replyed, but <hi>Leonida</hi> commanded ſilence; and taking <hi>Chriſante, Aſtrea, Diana, Phillis, Madonthe,</hi> and <hi>Laonice</hi> aſide, ſhe asked them their opinions and advice. But being long in conſultation, and the ſhepheards, who were not called to counſell, being impatient, and could not be idle, <hi>Hylas</hi> addreſſed himſelfe unto <hi>Doris:</hi> I do admire ſaid he unto her, that you ſhould be angry for being too rich. How do you mean, anſwered ſhe? I mean, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> that you ought to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, not only theſe two ſhepheards, who love you; but alſo, as an evidence of your beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, all thoſe that would offer themſelves unto you: For, it is a womans honour to be loved and courted by many, beſides the benefit ſhe may get by it. I do believe, (anſwered <hi>Doris,</hi> very careleſly) that this would be a good way for thoſe, who would be eſteemed fair, and are not; or, for ſuch as prefer that vanity, before tranquillity and ſolid content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If it be a Good to be loved, replyed he, the more that love you, the more good you have. And if it be ill, replyed <hi>Doris,</hi> the more I am loved, the more ill it is. True, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> but how can it be ill, to be loved by many? They will hate us in the end, anſwered ſhe. Yes, replyed he, if you do not content and entertain them. How ſhould one ſatisfie and content many replyed <hi>Doris,</hi> when it is impoſſible to ſatisfie and content one? But, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> is it not good to have many Servants? They will in the end become our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſaid ſhe, and in loving me, they will more trouble then benefit me. You muſt have a care, ſaid he, to keep them your friends. The paines, replyed the ſhepheardeſſe, is above the pleaſure. The gods, ſaid the ſhepheard, do never think themſelves troubled, that many ſhould bring offerings unto their Altars. Moſt true, anſwered ſhe, but it is a peculiar pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the gods, to do good unto many, without any trouble to them. Me-thinks, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> that ſince love depends upon the will, and ſince the will does extend it ſelfe to all it pleaſeth, there ſhould be no great pains in loving ſeverall perſons. The Lovers of this age, anſwered ſhe, are not contented with matter of will, but they would enjoy it in the effects; an I therefore I think it impoſſible, that the will ſhould be divided amongſt ſeverall perſons at one time. Every one of them, replyed he, muſt but have a part. This, anſwered the ſhepheardeſſe, I do think to be moſt impoſſible: But, ſuppoſe it might, ſince the love of one is ſo painfull, what would a great multitude be? Then it ſeemes, ſaid he, that you will love but one. One, anſwered ſhe, is too many, and therefore I will love none at all. And you, ſhepheards, (ſaid <hi>Hylas</hi> unto <hi>Palemon</hi> and <hi>Adraſtes)</hi> what do you ſay to this? We (ſaid <hi>Palemon)</hi> do make it appear, that we think one to be enough. How ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> muſt one love but one? Nay, fewer, anſwered <hi>Palemon,</hi> ſince we are two, and love but one. The diſcourſe of <hi>Hylas</hi> had continued longer, if the Nymph had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with all her company and ſtopped him: She therefore, and every of them, taking their places again, ſhe ſpake thus.</p>

                           <p>ALthough we do obſerve in this difference before us, ſeverall accidents which ſeem contrary to one another, yet none of them are contrary unto Love; for, it is not more naturall for Fire to flame and burn, then for Love to produce ſuch diſſentions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Lovers; and thoſe who go about to take them away, do attempt a thing, no leſſe impoſſible, then to take away heat from fire, or keep it from flaming. On the other ſide, conſidering, that he does not love, who does not wholly and entirely dedicate himſelfe unto her he loves, we conceive it, to be a kinde of treaſon, to let any other have a ſhare in his affection. And though we do expreſſe our ſelves only in the Maſculine perſon, yet it
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:53526:180"/>
doth hold as well in the Feminine. Therefore, all things being long and ſeriouſly debated and conſidered, we do conclude, that it would be unjuſt, that love ſhould be extinguiſhed by a thing, that is ſo naturall unto it ſelfe; or to divide it amongſt many, upon any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration whatſoever. And we do declare, that theſe fallings out, and little quarrells, are only renewings of love, and that to divide or change affection, is a crime of the higheſt nature that can be committed againſt Love. Upon this ground, we do ordain, that <hi>Doris</hi> ſhall love <hi>Palemon,</hi> and that <hi>Palemon</hi> being aſſured of her affection, ſhall for the future give her ſome better teſtimonies of his love, then by thoſe of jealouſie; though we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that jealouſie be a ſigne of love, but it is a ſigne of love, as ſickneſſe is a ſigne of life; for, as one cannot be ſick, unleſſe he live, ſo one cannot be jealous, unleſſe he love; but, as ſickneſſe is a ſigne of an ill tempered life, ſo jealouſie is an argument of an ill tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered love. <hi>Doris</hi> ſhall pardon, and receive <hi>Palemon</hi> into her favour again, and forget all former diſpleaſures, conſidering, that Love is a moſt violent paſſion; and makes one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit many things, which are not allowed of by him that committed them, nor ever would be, had he not been infected with that diſeaſe. And to avoid thoſe diſpleaſures which ſhe hath reſented for the time paſt, we do ordain, that as <hi>Doris</hi> ſhall treat <hi>Palemon</hi> as the perſon whom of all the world ſhe loves beſt, ſo likewiſe <hi>Palemon</hi> ſhall ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto the will of <hi>Doris;</hi> for, if he will be free, it will at laſt fall into tyranny. And as for the patient and unfortunate <hi>Adraſtes,</hi> we do ordain, that it ſhall be in his choice, whether he will continue an example of a faithfull and unfruitfull affection, by loving <hi>Doris</hi> ſtill, without any hopes of being loved again; or whether he will, by breaking the cords of his firſt love, by violence, by anger, or by deſpair, ſatisfie the affection of her, who loves him, and is ready to die for him.</p>

               <p>This was the judgment of the Nymph, which produced three very different effects in theſe three perſons; in <hi>Palemon,</hi> an extream contentment; in <hi>Doris,</hi> ſo great an aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, as ſhe ſtood ſpeechleſſe; but in <hi>Adraſtes,</hi> ſuch a ſuddain ſtupification of ſpirits, that he fell down as dead. So as whilſt <hi>Palemon,</hi> in an extaſie of joy, and with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand confuſed expreſſions, endeavoured to thank his Judge, for ſo favourable a judgment; <hi>Doris</hi> ſaid not a word, but fixed her eyes upon the ground, as not knowing whether ſhe ſhould be glad or ſad: and <hi>Adraſtes,</hi> lying all along without any ſenſe, did move all that ſaw him unto ſo much griefe, that <hi>Doris</hi> her ſelfe did pitty him. All the Company flocked about him, and lent him all poſſible aſſiſtance. When he came unto himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Leonida,</hi> accompanyed with <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and all her Companions, left them all three together, but they continued ſo, not long; for preſently after, <hi>Palemon</hi> taking <hi>Doris</hi> under the arme, went towards Mount <hi>Verdun;</hi> and <hi>Adraſtes</hi> following them with his eye, and loſing the ſight of them amongſt the Trees: Farewell (ſaid he) you happy and moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Lovers; go and enjoy, both your happineſſe and mine, whilſt I, by this moſt unjuſt Ordinance, do all my life lament the loſſe of that felicity which you enjoy. Theſe were the laſt words he uttered out of a ſound judgment, for a long time; for ever ſince, his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits were ſo troubled, that he loſt his wits, and committed ſuch abſurd follies, that even ſuch as could not chuſe but laugh at him, could not chuſe alſo but pitty him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hylas,</hi> finding no juſtice in this Judgment which the Nymph had given, did main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his opinion againſt all thoſe, who conceived, that this difference could not be better determined. And becauſe <hi>Leonida</hi> &amp; <hi>Paris</hi> were not ignorant of his humour, they were very deſirous to paſſe away the time in talking with him; and in order thereunto, <hi>Paris</hi> began thus: Me-thinks, Siſter (ſaid he) that you have done poor <hi>Adraſtes</hi> abundance of wrong, and might have well given a milder ſentence for him. Are not you of that opinion, <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las?</hi> For my part, (anſwered he) I believe, the heavens had a minde to puniſh the fool <hi>Adraſtes;</hi> for otherwiſe it was not likely, they would have ſuffered him to be thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; but I muſt needs confeſſe, that his fond and fooliſh paſſion, does not deſerve a leſſe puniſhment. You, <hi>Hylas,</hi> and I, (anſwered the Nymph) are of very different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; for his love unto <hi>Doris,</hi> continued with ſo much conſtancy and reſolution, me-thinks, is ſo far from deſerving any puniſhment that I do much commend him for it; and therefore I gave him leave to continue it ſtill, if he would. A very fine leave indeed, ſaid <hi>Hylas:</hi> Why? you might as well give him leave to live all his life in miſery; for my part, I think you were very rigorous in it; and I am ſure, that were it my caſe, I would revoke your judgment. What judgment would you have given, (ſaid the Nymph, and ſmiled) if you had been in my room? I ſhould have contented them all three, anſwered he. I
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:53526:180"/>
am ſure (ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> and interrupted them) that this Ordinance proceeds from a ſolid and well diſgeſted judgment. I am ſure, (ſaid <hi>Hylas)</hi> that ſuch as are of <hi>Silvander</hi>'s me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly temper, are not fit to be Judges of Love; but if you will ſolidly and ſeriouſly conſider the reaſons why one ſhould love, you will ſay, that I am in the right, and that <hi>Doris, Adraſtes,</hi> and <hi>Palemon,</hi> might have been all three contented and ſatisfied. How could that poſſibly be, ſaid the Numph? By ordaining (replyed <hi>Hylas)</hi> that <hi>Doris</hi> ſhould love them both, and that both of them ſhould ſerve her; for by this means, they would have had what they deſired, which was, that ſhe ſhould love them, and ſhe would have been better ſerved.</p>
               <p>There was none in the Company that could refrain from laughing, when they heard this judgment, eſpecially <hi>Leonida.</hi> Which <hi>Hylas</hi> ſeeing: It ſeemes, great Nymph, ſaid he, that I have made you all very merry, and that you mock me. Nay rather, (anſwered ſhe) it ſeemes, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that you mock us. Excuſe him, Madam, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> for he ſpeaks as he thinks. If your thoughts (ſaid he unto <hi>Silvander,</hi> almoſt angry) be different from mine, you think but very ill; and I would gladly know what arguments you have, to blame my judgment in this. <hi>Silvander</hi> anſwered very careleſly; Common ſenſe tells us, that what many have a ſhare in is entirely poſſeſſed by none: If many have ſhares in the love of <hi>Doris, Adraſtes</hi> and <hi>Palemon</hi> can have but their parts; and he that has but a part in love has nothing of it at all. But why (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi> unto <hi>Silvander)</hi> do you ſpeak thus unto <hi>Hylas?</hi> do you not know, how he does not underſtand that language? Truly (ſaid <hi>Hylas)</hi> you do very well to put in your vie alſo; for perhaps <hi>Silvander</hi> alone is not <hi>Babell</hi> enough, to confound all the World. Then addreſſing himſelfe unto <hi>Leonida:</hi> Did you ever Madam, hear ſuch an abſurd opinion, (ſaid he) as this of <hi>Silvander</hi>'s, that if one have but a part of a thing, he hath nothing at all: Will any one think, that there is no water in a River, becauſe the Sea is not in it? I would gladly know what this Common Senſe is, which teacheth ſuch falſe Doctrines. <hi>Silvander</hi> anſwered: If Love could be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſtill remain Love, as Water may, and ſtill be Water, I ſhould yield unto you. Water is of ſuch a nature that the leaſt drop is Water, as well as the whole Sea; but Love, on the contrary, is no longer Love, if the leaſt part be wanting; and to prove this to be a truth, Love does conſiſt principally in an extream affection, and perpetuall fidelity; if you take either of theſe parts from it, it is love no longer, &amp; I believe, there is none in the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, except <hi>Hylas,</hi> but will confeſſe it; for, if the extream be wanting in the affection, or if fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity be wanting, it is treaſon, and not love; if fidelity be in it, and not perpetuall, it is not fidelity but perfidie: So as, <hi>Hylas,</hi> I muſt conclude, that who ſo hath only one part of Love, hath nothing of it at all. If it be ſo, that Love is a thing individuall, it had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt reaſon to enjoyne <hi>Doris,</hi> to divide her love, partly to <hi>Palemon,</hi> and partly to <hi>Adraſtes.</hi> Upon this <hi>Paris</hi> began to ſpeak: Me-thinks, <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid he, that we have reaſon of our ſide, but <hi>Silvander</hi> has by his diſcourſe gotten the favourable opinion of all the Company; and let me tell you, that if you do not anſwer him, I ſhall acknowledge what he ſaith. Generous <hi>Paris,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Hylas)</hi> whatſoever <hi>Silvander</hi> ſaies, or whatſoever you think, yet truth will never change; and for my part, I am ſure, experience is more certain then all manner of words, for there is no arguing againſt it. Now <hi>Silvander</hi> has nothing, but a few ſmooth handſome words, to prove what he ſaith; but I have found what I ſay, by ſo many effects, and familiar experience, that I will never ſeek any further then my ſelfe for any arguments: For, I have loved many at once, and ſay what he will or can, I am ſure I did truly love them; and therefore may not <hi>Doris</hi> do the ſame? Many (replyed <hi>Silvander)</hi> do think, they do things, when they do them not: All Artificers, but more eſpecially thoſe that do addict themſelves unto the Arts and Sciences, which are not Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall, have a very great opinion of what they do, and very few, but think their own works much better and more perfect then any others, when as it is apparent, they do but deceive themſelves, and very often, great imperfections are ſeen in them by others: Selfe-love is ever blinde, but alwaies open to the eyes of others. <hi>Hylas</hi> thinks he loves, and that he loves well, though he be but a very bad workman; and therefore, whoſoever would love aright, and not erre, muſt never take him for a pattern. Who, then (ſaid <hi>Hylas)</hi> my ſelfe? If any, (anſwered <hi>Silvander)</hi> believe it, <hi>Silvander</hi> is he? See (ſaid <hi>Hylas)</hi> one of the greateſt pieces of preſumption that ever ſelfe-love produced: Do you think, none but your ſelfe can love well? I ſay, (anſwered <hi>Silvander)</hi> that my affection is pure and perfect, that you cannot tax it with any fault; nay more, that you cannot name me ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that excells me. So, ſo, (ſaid <hi>Hylas)</hi> was ever any ſo over-weened and arrogant as
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:53526:181"/>
this ſhepheard? Is he the only one that knowes how to love? Came he from heaven? Is he the great pattern unto men, and gives them the Lawes of Love, and can meaſure the grandure and perfection of our wills? Fair Nymph, if it would not be too tedious unto you, I beſeech you give me leave to ſhew him his error. Then cocking his Beaver with one arme a kembow, and the other accompanying by its geſture the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of his ſpeech, he ſpoke thus: I obſerve two things, <hi>Silvander,</hi> in your ſpeech; the one, that your affection is pure, and perfect, and unalterable; the other, that I cannot name another more accompliſhed. Can any thing be added unto that which is perfect? I am confident, you will ſay, No; for, if it would admit of any addition, then it wants ſomething, and cannot be perfect. That thing unto which nothing can be added, muſt be arrived at its extremity, and therefore it muſt be confeſſed, that whatſoever is perfect is extream. Now, if your affection be perfect, then nothing can be added unto it, nor can it be made greater then it is, nor more accompliſhed. Now tell me preſently, What is Love? Is it not a deſire of beauty, and of a good which you want? But your love is a deſire of a good which you want: Therefore it muſt conſequently be confeſſed, that ſomething may be added unto your Love, which it hath not. Moreover, you ſay, that your affection cannot be taxed with any crime: If I ſhould ask you, whom it is you do love, you would anſwer, that it is <hi>Diana.</hi> If I ſhould aske further, who this <hi>Diana</hi> is, you would reply, that ſhe is the moſt perfect ſhepheardeſſe in the world. Then anſwer I, If this ſhepheardeſſe be ſo perfect as you eſteem her, are you not very bold, in daring to love one that is ſo full of perfection? For, there muſt alwaies be ſome proportion, betwixt the Lover and the Loved; and I cannot believe, that all your preſumption can perſwade her, that you are ſo perfect as you think your ſelfe. Perhaps you will charge me with the ſame fault, in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Phillis,</hi> who, you will ſay, hath much more perfection then I. But I am of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beliefe unto you; for I do not hold her for ſuch a one, as you do your <hi>Diana:</hi> I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, ſhe is owner both of beauty and merit; and am I without? She has wit, ſo have I: She is wiſe, I am no fool: She is a ſhepheardeſſe, I am a ſhepheard: She is <hi>Phillis,</hi> and I am <hi>Hylas.</hi> Is there not an eeven conformity and equality betwixt us? So as in anſwer unto all you can aske, I propoſe it as a more perfect love then yours; ſo as if one deſire to love aright, <hi>Hylas,</hi> and not <hi>Silvander,</hi> muſt be the pattern. For, to what purpoſe is it to love, unleſſe to have contentment? But what contentment or pleaſure can theſe drooping me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly Lovers have, who are perpetually muſing and fretting at their hearts, againſt this Bug-bear and Chimaera of Conſtancy. <hi>Diana,</hi> does <hi>Silvander</hi> ſay, does not love me; alas, ſhe loves another, and ſcornes me; but for all that, I will love, and ſerve, and adore her, leſt I ſhould be taxed with inconſtancy. <hi>Phillis,</hi> does <hi>Hylas</hi> ſay, does not love me, ſhe loves another, and ſcornes me; why ſhould not I change this ungratefull woman for another, that will love me, and ſcorn ſome other for my ſake? Shall this Bug-bear, of being taxed with inconſtancy, hinder me? Ah friends, I pray tell me, what kinde of Beaſt is this Inconſtancy? Who did it ever devour? What diſeaſe did it ever breed? Did any ever die of it? How many have you ſeen in mourning by reaſon of it? No, no, it is a meer imagination, a fancy, a chimaera, or rather an invention of ſome ſubtle Lover, who ſeeing her ſelfe growne ugly, or ready to be changed for ſome other, that was fairer then her ſelfe, did broach this opinion, and made it to be thought a mortall ſin, to be Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. Will any man, in his witts, be thus deluded? Can he be ſo ſilly, as to conſume all his life without any comfort? Do you call this Love, forſooth, and Conſtancy? May it not with much more reaſon be called madneſſe and folly? What! languiſh in the lap of an old, ugly, and ungratefull Miſtreſſe! Fie, fie, it is an errour far unworthy of a man, that pretends unto any wit or courage. Let not <hi>Silvander</hi> therefore ask any more, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I can taxe his Love, or where I can finde one that is more perfect; for I am confident, there is not one in the Company who will not ſay, that <hi>Hylas</hi> loves, and <hi>Hylas</hi> alone loves, as a man of wit and courage ought to do.</p>
               <p>Thus ended this inconſtant ſhepheard, ſo moved with his own arguments, that he was as hot as any fire. Every one ſmiled, and looked upon <hi>Silvander,</hi> in expectation of what he would ſay; and he, to give them ſatisfaction, very ſleightly anſwered thus.</p>
               <p>I thought, Madam, I ſhould have encountred with a Shepheard, in the preſence of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Shepheardeſſes; but for ought I ſee, I ſhall finde him an <hi>Athenian</hi> Oratour, ſo much is <hi>Hylas</hi> tranſported with his eloquence: Yet, I wiſh, (ſo confident I am in the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of my cauſe) that he, of us two, who ſhall be condemned, may be ſo ſeverely cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed, for ſpeaking ſo boldly before ſuch ſacred Altars, as he ſhall either give his Oration
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:53526:181"/>
the lie, or elſe be plunged in the River <hi>Reſne.</hi> That is not reaſonable, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> unleſſe I had been advertiſed of it, before I began to ſpeak, or might have ſuch Judges, as I did not ſuſpect of partiality. Why, ſaid the Nymph, do you ſuſpectus? Becauſe, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> you believe all that <hi>Silvander</hi> ſaith, to be an Oracle; and becauſe he has been a while at the <hi>Maſſilian</hi> Schooles, you admire all he ſaies, and think him to be alwaies in the right. No, no, <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> never refuſe to abide the judgment of this great Nymph, and the venerable <hi>Chriſante;</hi> never fear, ſhepheard, I ſee they are not diſpoſed unto rigour: and the worſt will be, but an acknowledgment of your errour. And therefore I will begin.</p>
               <p>You ſay, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that there is no perfect love, without an acquiſition of ſome deſired good becauſe Love is only a deſire of ſome good which it wants. But, Madam, I humbly beſeech you, before I anſwer this ſhepheard, to pardon me, if, for the diſcovery of his ſubtleties, I uſe ſome termes, which are not frequently uſed amongſt us. Therefore, anſwer me, ſhepheard: Does any deſire that, which they do poſſeſſe? You will ſay, No; becauſe deſire is only of ſomething wanting: But if Love, as you ſay, is only a deſire, do you not ſee, that to poſſeſſe what one deſires, is to quench Love, ſince none does deſire that which they poſſeſſe? Why, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> doth not one love that which they poſſeſſe? If they do not, I had rather you ſhould love; and that I ſhould not love, to the end, you may deſire, and I may poſſeſſe. I do not ſay ſo, (ſaid <hi>Silvander)</hi> but I ſay, that Love is not only a deſire to poſſeſſe, as you would perſwade; but on the contrary, poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and enjoyment does rather make it die then live. If enjoyment do not make it live, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> yet it is enjoyment which gives it perfection. No, neither, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> for enjoyment is not at all neceſſary, to make a perfect Love. A Diamond is as perfect a Diamond before it be wrought, as after the Artiſt hath poliſhed it. For, if the perfection of Love did depend upon this Enjoyment, it would not be in the power of him that loves to love perfectly, ſince the enjoyment does not depend upon him, but upon the conſent of another: And yet, Love, being an act of the Will, which is guided as the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thinks good, and the Will being free in all that it does, this act of his Will cannot depend upon any other then himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But admit, that Love be nothing but a deſire, muſt it be concluded from thence, that Love may be encreaſed, by the enjoyment of that which one deſires? If you conſider it well, you will ſay, that Love is rather leſſe by it; for, our ſoules do in this reſemble a Bow, the more the ſtring is ſtretched, with more violence doth it ſhoot its Arrowes. So our ſoules do ſhoot out more violent deſires, when the thing deſired is hard to be accompliſhed, than when it is eaſie and in our power. If deſires do leſſen at things eaſily accompliſhed, much more when it is glutted: And if Love be only a deſire, how can you think, that deſires will be augmented by enjoyment, which do diminiſh and glut them? Therefore, <hi>Hylas,</hi> do not ſay, that my Love being a deſire, cannot be perfect without enjoyment: And do not accuſe of arrogance, becauſe there ought to be an equall proportion betwixt <hi>Diana</hi> and me; unleſſe you will deny, that men may love the gods, for then I ſhall yield unto you: But if you confeſſe, that to love the gods be the greateſt commandment upon us; then I ask you, ſhepheard, whether there be a greater diſproportion betwixt <hi>Diana</hi> and me, then betwixt <hi>Thautates</hi> and <hi>Hylas.</hi> And to convince you of your errour, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, I explain this ſecret myſtery of Love unto you. We cannot love, unleſſe we do know the thing which we do love. Oh, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> how falſe is that poſition? For, I do love above a hundred Ladies and Shepheardeſſes, and yet I never knew one of them well; for, as ſoon as I found them to be peeviſh and diſdainfull, I left them, and was angry with my ſelfe, for thinking otherwiſe of them then I found them. This reaſon, (anſwered <hi>Silvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)</hi> ought to make you confeſſe what I do ſay: For, you did love that which you knew not; that is, having an opinion, that they were full of perfections, you judged them ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, you loved them; but finding out the truth, you left loving them; and by this you ſee, that the knowledge of the perſons, was the originall and ſource of your love; and truly, if the will from whence love begins, be never moved unto any thing, but what the judgment thinks good, there being no likelyhood, that the underſtanding can judge upon a thing, of which it hath no knowledge; I do wonder how you can imagine, one ſhould love that which he doth not know. I do confeſſe, that as the eye may ſometimes be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſo may the underſtanding, and may judge that amiable which is not: But yet, Love muſt come from knowledge, be it true or falſe. Now this being ſo, have you not learned in the <hi>Maſsilian</hi> Schooles, that underſtanding, and the thing underſtood, are but one and the ſame thing? What! ſtill harping upon the ſame ſtring, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> are you
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:53526:182"/>
                  <hi>Diana, Silvander,</hi> as you were the other day? Truly, <hi>Diana,</hi> (ſaid he, and turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her) you are a very pretty Boy: And you, <hi>Silvander,</hi> (ſaid he, and turned towards him) you are a very handſome Wench. Believe me, ſhepheard, you are excellent good company, and will ere long be as pleaſant a Fool, as ever was in <hi>Forreſts.</hi> Every one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to laugh at this, <hi>Silvander</hi> himſelfe could not hold, hearing how he interpreted what he had ſaid, and his way of ſpeaking; and therefore he continued thus: You may very well, ſhepheard, ſaid he, make your ſelfe merry with me, ſince I had no more wit then to prophane theſe myſteries, by communicating them unto you; nor ſhould I have done it, had we been alone, but I was conſtrained unto it, becauſe I would not leave thoſe that hear us, in an errour. But, though you will not allow what I ſay for Orth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dox, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you will hearken unto what your ſelfe ſaid, concerning <hi>Phillis:</hi> I mean, that you did alledge the good opinion which you had of your own merits, and the merits of <hi>Phillis,</hi> as a good argument, and that you did not eſteem he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s ſuch, but that yours might equall them. Now if you had this beliefe of your ſelfe, why will you not allow me to take the ſame advantage of ſelfe conceit; for I do think, that the ſame proportion that is betwixt the fire, and the wood which the fire burnes, is betwixt <hi>Diana</hi> and me. Now if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this to me good friend, why do you take more priviledge to your ſelfe? But I dare with aſſurance affirme, that <hi>Hylas</hi> does not love <hi>Phillis;</hi> I ſhall maintain it to be abſolutely impoſſible: For the chiefe Ordinance of Love, is, <hi>That a Lover do think all things moſt perfect in the perſon Loved.</hi> And truly, it is a Law moſt juſt, and grounded upon great reaſon; for, if a Lover ought to love his Miſtreſſe above all things in the whole Univerſe, ought he not to eſteem her above all things, ſince his will directs him alwaies unto that, which his underſtanding tells him is beſt? But it does plainly appear, that it is <hi>Hylas</hi> you love, and not <hi>Phillis,</hi> by ſaying, that none loves, but for their own content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now the pains which Lovers do voluntarily take, only in doing ſervice unto thoſe they love, does plainly make the contrary appear. And have you not heard ſay that we live more where we love, then where we breathe? I ſhall never believe that, anſwered <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las;</hi> this is nothing but talk, that comes from ſuch idle imaginations as yours. Had you ſaid (replyed <hi>Silvander)</hi> that the talk came from ſuch a wounded imagination as mine, you had ſaid right for the imagination of a Lover is ſo: We ſee ſome ready to die upon the wound of one little word, upon the caſt of an eye; nay, ſometimes upon very ſuſpition: Sometimes you ſhall ſee a Lover deny unto himſelfe all manner of reſt and contentment, only to enjoy the ſight of the party loved, for one minute. But, <hi>Hylas,</hi> did you know what a felicity it is, to be a fool in ſuch occaſions, you would confeſſe, that all the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the world is not comparable to this pleaſing folly: Were you able to comprehend it, you would never aske, what pleaſure and contentment thoſe faithfull Lovers, whom you phraſe melancholly and penſive, do receive; for you then would know, that they are ſo raviſhed in contemplation of the party whom they love and adore, as, ſcorning all that is in the whole Univerſe, they do not repent of any thing more, than the loſſe of that time which they ſpend any where elſe; and their ſoules not being well able to contain the grandure of their contentment, they ſtand aſtoniſhed at ſo much treaſure, and ſo many felicities, which tranſcends their knowledge. Know, that the happineſſe which Love doth recompenſe unto faithfull Lovers, is the ſame that he may give unto the gods: And theſe Lovers, raiſing themſelves above the nature of men, do almoſt make themſelves gods; for all other pleaſures which you do ſo highly priſe, are ſuch only, as a baſtard-Love does afford, unto ſuch Animals as are without reaſon; and ſuch men as are only taken with them, they do degenerate from the nature of Men, and become almoſt Animals, deprived of all reaſon. Into ſuch a Monſter, <hi>Hylas,</hi> do you degenerate, when you do love other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then as you ought; ſuch a Monſtroſitie, I ſay does appear in you, ſince there is no proportion in it, and, like Monſters, it cannot produce its like; and, to be briefe, like a Monſter it cannot live long. On the contrary, my love is every way ſo perfect, as nothing can be added or diminiſhed, without an offence to reaſon; for, both in grandure and quality, I can, without any vanity, ſay, that it is arrived at perfection. In ſaying, that my affection could not be blamed or taxed, I had great reaſon to ſay ſo; for ſhe, from whence it doth proceed, did never produce any thing, but what was moſt perfect. And I know, that the gods would chaſtiſe me, if I ſhould dare to offer unto a ſoul ſo perfect as hers, an affection that could any waies be blamed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Silvander</hi> would have continued, when <hi>Hylas,</hi> not being able to be patient any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, interrupted him in this manner: <hi>Silvander,</hi> how long do you intend to abuſe the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:53526:182"/>
patience of thoſe who hear you? How long will you fill their ears with your vanities and fond imaginations? And how long, do you think, I can endure the impertinences of your language. All the Company were ſurpriſed to hear <hi>Hylas</hi> come out with his expreſſions in ſo loud a voice, as every one began to laugh ſo loud, that he was forced to be ſilent. And becauſe the day was almoſt ſpent, and <hi>Leonida</hi> was to return unto <hi>Adamas,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late unto him all theſe paſſages; as <hi>Hylas</hi> was beginning to ſpeak, ſhe ſaid thus unto him: No, no, you have diſputed long enough, <hi>Hylas,</hi> for one time; the reverend <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſante</hi> is not accuſtomed to be ſo long from the Temple of the good goddeſſe: Let it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, ſhepheard, that we know, you have very good arguments againſt <hi>Silvander,</hi> but we entreat you to refer them untill another time; in the mean time, we will go away in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that if you had had time to expreſs your ſelf, you would have gotten the better of him, as yet he hath got the better of you. See, (ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> halfe angry) how there will be ſtill ſome imperfections or other in our natures. What do you ſay, replyed the Nymph? I ſay, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Hylas,</hi> that though you be a Nymph, yet you make it appear, you are but a woman, and has not patience to hear out the truth, but is pleaſed with the tickling flatteries of this ſhepheard, who does but deceive you. You do not at all offend me, (ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> &amp; ſmiled) in calling me a woman; for truly I am ſo, and would be ſo, and would not change ſexes with the moſt accompliſhed man in the Country: But I know not why you ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me with the fault that <hi>Silvander</hi> hath committed, in alledging very good reaſons; and with the fault which <hi>Hylas</hi> hath committed, in anſwering him ſo very ill.</p>
               <p>Queſtionleſſe <hi>Hylas</hi> had replyed, if he had heard the Nymph; but he being gone away in a chaſe, he did not hear theſe laſt words. And <hi>Leonida</hi> ſeeing it was very late, ſhe went with <hi>Chriſante</hi> and the Druides Daughters, unto the Temple of the good goddeſſe, and afterwards went to <hi>Adamas, Paris</hi> not following her; for his affection unto <hi>Diana</hi> was ſuch, as he enjoyed no felicity but in her preſence. Thus the Nymph went unto her Uncles, and <hi>Paris</hi> taking the contrary way, went unto the fair ſhepheardeſſes, and ſtayed with them a long time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonida</hi> deſired very much to relate unto her Uncle, all that had been done for <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> and by fortune ſhe met him, walking upon a Tarraſſe, which was ſhadowed with Sicamours, before the houſe. He wondred to ſee her return ſo ſoon, and ſhe telling him the cauſe, he could not chuſe but laugh, that every one ſhould be ſo deceived. I think, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> that it will be a good inducement unto him, to leave this kinde of life which he lives; for, if he ſhould be acquainted, that his ſhepheardeſſe loves him, and laments his loſſe, doubtleſſe he would take a reſolution to ſee her; but I do not conceive it ſo fit for me to tell him, as for you, aſſuring my ſelfe, that the amity and reſpect he bears unto you, will have better operation upon him, then all the Rhetorick I can uſe, for your words have more weight and ſolidity in them, then mine have. I ſhall tell <hi>Celadon,</hi> (ſaid the Druide) but I know not what effects my ſpeaking will produce; for I know he loves me, and bears much reſpect unto me in all things, but concerning his affection: And I muſt confeſſe, that I had long ſince acquainted the ſhepheardeſſe <hi>Aſtrea</hi> where he was, knowing that ſhe loved him, had I not feared it would have been a means, to make him go unto ſome other ſalvage and retired place, where I could not finde him again; but my fears of loſing him did reſtrain me. It is now two daies ſince we ſaw him, and therefore it will not be amiſſe, if tomorrow we give him a viſit, and do the beſt we can to prevail with him.</p>
               <p>In this reſolution therefore, they went to bed, and in the morning, day did no ſooner appear, but <hi>Leonida</hi> got up, and <hi>Adamas</hi> alſo, ſo that as ſoon as they were dreſſed, they ſet forward. That morning, the ſhepheard was not gone out of his Cave, but was beyond meaſure penſive at the paſſages of the preceeding day; yet very glad, and wel pleaſed with his fortune, that had given him leave to ſee the fair <hi>Aſtrea</hi> once more before he dyed: And conſidering, that he had never received ſuch a favour from her, as at that encounter, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when he was a young Child, when he ſaw her in the Temple of <hi>Venus;</hi> he cryed out: Oh moſt happy misfortune, that hath been more favourable unto me, then my beſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune! Oh the goodneſſe of Love, which in his greateſt torments gives the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments! Who would ever retire himſelfe from thy obedience, ſince thou haſte ſo great a care of all that are thine? Whilſt this ſhepheard was thus entertaining himſelfe, <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> and <hi>Leonida</hi> came to him. And becauſe <hi>Celadon</hi>'s face did teſtifie the contentment which he received, the Druide and the Nymph, after common ſalutations, told him, that they much rejoyced to ſee him look better then he did, and hoped, that he had received ſome
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:53526:183"/>
kinde of comfortable courage. The comforts which you do finde in my countenance, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Celadon,</hi> are like unto Suns in Winter, which riſe late and ſet early, and which indeed do give ſome light; but it is through ſo many muddy clouds, that neither the light nor the heat do much warm. Then he related to them his encounter with <hi>Silvander;</hi> how he had put a Letter into his hand; how he ſaw <hi>Aſtrea</hi> with all the ſhepheardeſſes, and had put a Letter into her breaſt. But alas, Father, (ſaid he) this happineſſe was too great for me, and I am afraid, that it was only to make me more ſenſible of my ſorrowes; and that heaven, to make me more ſad in my miſerable condition, did only let me ſee her, whoſe I ought to be, if there were any juſtice in Love.</p>
               <p>No, Childe, anſwered the Druide, Love having care of you, and intending to make you more happy then you are, hath given you this ſmall contentment, leſt you ſhould be driven out of one extremity into another knowing very well, that ſuch ſudden changes are very dangerous. And in confirmation of what I ſay, <hi>Leonida</hi> will tell you what ſhe hath ſeen, and what declarations of amity ſhe has ſeen the fair <hi>Aſtrea</hi> make. Then the Nymph acquainted him with the empty Tombe, that was erected for him, with the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, the tears, and diſcourſe of every one, and particularly of <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> and that you may give credit unto what I ſay, (ſaid the Nymph) let us go and ſee <hi>Celadon</hi>'s Tombe, for it is ſo neer this place, that perhaps you heard the voices of the Druides Daughters, and the Prieſt. You tell me ſuch ſtories, (ſaid <hi>Celadon)</hi> that I ſhould hardly believe them, had they come from the mouth of any other. I would not have you, replyed the Nymph, give more credit unto me, then to the veryeſt ſtranger in the world; but come, and believe your own eyes. Upon this, the Druide and <hi>Leonida</hi> got him out of his Cave, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him into the Wood, where his empty Tombe was erected: Oh! how aſtoniſhed he was, and how preſently he began to read that Inſcription which <hi>Silvander</hi> had ſet upon it? and having read it three or foure times over: I muſt needs confeſſe, (ſaid he) that you told me truth. But having received ſo great a contentment, would it not be want of love, if I ſhould have any deſire, ſince I muſt not ſee her? Doubtleſſe (ſaid <hi>Adamas)</hi> if you ſhould live a Recluſe, and never ſee her, it would argue want of courage and love in you. Want of Love! (anſwered the ſhepheard preſently) Ah no: I confeſſe, it might argue want of courage, which upon this occaſion might fail me, becauſe I have ſuch abundance of Love. I ſhould believe, (anſwered <hi>Adamas)</hi> that you do not love <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> if knowing that ſhe loves you, and you may ſee her, you abſent your ſelfe from her preſence.</p>
               <p>Love, anſwered the ſhepheard commands me to obey her, and ſince ſhe hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me not to ſee her, do you call it want of love, if I obſerve her commandment? When ſhe laid that command upon you, (ſaid the Druide) ſhe did hate you; but now ſhe loves you, and grieves for you, not only as abſent, but as dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Be it as it will, anſwered <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> ſhe Commanded me; and be it as it will, I will Obey her. Yet, replyed <hi>Adamas,</hi> as perfect an obſerver as you are of her commands, you have already diſobeyed, ſince you have ſeen her, and were preſent before her eyes. She did not forbid me (ſaid <hi>Celadon)</hi> from ſeeing her, but only not to come in her ſight; and how could ſhe ſee me, when ſhe was aſleep? Since it is ſo, ſaid the Druide, I will finde out a way, that you ſhall ſee her every day, if you pleaſe, and ſhe ſhall not ſee you. I conceive that, (ſaid <hi>Celadon)</hi> to be very difficult, for ſhe muſt either be aſleep, or elſe I muſt be cloſe hid in ſome place. No, replyed the Druide; for more then that, you may ſpeak to her alſo if you pleaſe. This cannot be, (replyed the ſhepheard) unleſſe I be in a very dark place. You ſhall (ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damas)</hi> be in the open light, and ſee her, if you have but courage, or if Love have the power to make you attempt it. Do not think, Father, (anſwered <hi>Celadon)</hi> that there ſhall be either want of love or courage in me, provided I do not diſobey her commands. Now ſee (ſaid the Druide) how I do intend to contrive it. It is the goodneſſe of the great <hi>Tautates,</hi> to give me a Daughter, whom I deerly love above my own life: This Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, according to the rigour of our Lawes, is educated amongſt the Druides Daughters, in the Monoſteries of <hi>Carnutes;</hi> it will be above the expiration of eight long years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can have any hopes of her comming out. Perhaps you may remember, how I told you, how there is a great reſemblance betwixt you and her, both in age and face. Now I do intend to give it out, that ſhe has been ſick, and upon ſuch an occaſion, the antient Druides will allow her to retire, untill ſuch time as ſhe be able to officiate in the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Exerciſes: A few daies after, you ſhall aſſume her habit, and I will receive you into my houſe, under the notion and name of my Daughter <hi>Alexis:</hi> And it is very requiſite
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:53526:183"/>
to give out that ſhe is ſick; for, your way of living theſe laſt two Months, hath ſo altered your face, and taken away that freſh colour which was wont to be in your cheeks, as any that ſees you would be deceived. And though the reſemblance which is betwixt you be not ſo great, but that when you are both together, a great difference may be found, it is no matter; for it is ſo long ſince any in this Country ſaw her, that though the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance were leſſe, yet when they hear me call you Daughter, they will certainly take you for her. I ſee nothing in all this, but one inconvenience, which is, that every year we all uſe to aſſemble our ſelves at <hi>Dreux,</hi> a place ſo neer the Carnutan-Monaſtery, that the Druides and Prieſts may come to diſcover, that my Daughter is not gone from thence: But this ſhall be no ſtop; for it will be two months before theſe Druides do aſſemble, and they muſt ſtay there two months more, and god knowes, whether before that time you may not have changed your habit and life. Now, <hi>Celadon,</hi> conſider, whether all this be not very feaſable. Ah! Father, (ſaid <hi>Celadon,</hi> after he had a while thought upon it) do you think, that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> by this means will not ſee me? Do you think, andſwered the Druide, that ſhe can ſee you, when ſhe does not know you: How can ſhe know you, when you are in ſuch a habit? But, Father, (replyed <hi>Celadon)</hi> let me be habited as you will, I ſhall be ſtill <hi>Celadon</hi> in reality; ſo as I ſhall thereby diſobey her. That you are ſtill <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> is true, anſwered <hi>Adamas</hi> but ſtill you do not by this diſobey her command: For, ſhe has not forbidden you to be <hi>Celadon,</hi> but only, that ſhe ſhall not ſee this <hi>Celadon.</hi> Now when ſhe ſees you, ſhe does not ſee <hi>Celadon,</hi> but <hi>Alexis.</hi> And, for a concluſion of all, if ſhe do not know you, you do not offend her; and though ſhe ſhould know you, and be angry, and command you to die; yet, were not ſuch an end better, then to languiſh to death in this manner? This, Father, ſaid the ſhepheard, is a good reaſon, and I will ground upon it; therefore, Father, I will put my ſelfe, my life, and my contentment, all into your hands; diſpoſe of me therefore as you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Thus did <hi>Adamas</hi> work upon the obſtinacy of <hi>Celadon;</hi> and to the end he ſhould not change his minde, he returned that very houre to take order for what was neceſſary, and eſpecially to ſpread abroad a report, that his Daughter was ſick, and was to return home. For it was the cuſtome of Druides Daughters, when they were ſick, to come out of their Monaſteries; and if their Parents were negligent, the Ancients of the Monaſtery would ſend unto them, for they held it as a great misfortune, if any dyed there. Therefore he gave out, that the Antients had ſent unto him, that his Daughter was to come home, and that he expected her every day. <hi>Adamas</hi> and <hi>Leonida</hi> were very buſie, in providing all things neceſſary for <hi>Celadon,</hi> who, in the mean time, had leaſure to bid adieu unto <hi>Lignon,</hi> and to take his leave of his Woods, and of his Cell, but eſpecially of the Temple of the goddeſſe <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> And when he was tricked up in the habit of a Nymph, (for ſo the Druides Daughters of that Country were dreſſed, when they returned from their Monaſteries) and was ready to depart, they thought it expedient to ſtay till night, to the end, none might ſee him come alone; and in the mean time, <hi>Adamas</hi> iuſtructed him, what to anſwer unto each, who enquired how the Druides Daughters lived, or of their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, Sacrifices, Schooles, or Sciences; but, ſaid he, the beſt way is, to ſpeak as little as poſſibly you can, eſpecially before ſuch, as are knowing in the affairs of the world; as for others, it matters not, for they will believe any thing you tell them. Now the day being almoſt done, they went from that place at the entrance, into which <hi>Celadon</hi> had engraved theſe Lines with the point of his knife upon a Rock, with much paines and time, having begun them that very day, he reſolved firſt to leave the place, for an eternall memory of his being there. The Lines were theſe.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Within this hollow, dark, and rocky Cell.</l>
                  <l>Diſdain and Love a long time both did dwell.</l>
                  <l>Before you enter, if their wounds you fear,</l>
                  <l>Turn back and flie, there's no abiding here.</l>
                  <l>For, as a Coal is hot, though it ſeem dead,</l>
                  <l>After the flame is quite extinguiſhed:</l>
                  <l>Even ſo, Diſdain and Love, though abſent be,</l>
                  <l>Yet relicks of their fire may leave for thee.</l>
               </q>
               <p>This buſineſſe was carried on by <hi>Adamas</hi> with ſo much prudence, that <hi>Paris</hi> himſelfe could not diſcover any thing, reſolving to deceive him if he could, ſooner then any other,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:53526:184"/>
to the end, that he might the better deceive others: He therefore took this ſuppoſed <hi>Alexis</hi> for his Siſter, whom afterwards we will no longer call <hi>Celadon.</hi> As good luck was, when <hi>Adamas</hi> came home, <hi>Paris</hi> was not there, and therefore he could not ſee how ſhe came alone. As ſoon as ſhe came there, <hi>Adamas</hi> got her to bed, giving out, that ſhe was weary, by reaſon of travell and her ſickneſſe; ſo as <hi>Paris</hi> ſaw her not untill the next morning; and <hi>Adamas</hi> and <hi>Leonida</hi> would not ſuffer her to come out of her Chamber, whoſe windowes were ſo ſhut; that the little light hindred him from diſcovery, what they deſired to keep cloſe, and they continued thus ſeverall daies: Though this Artifice was ſuperfluous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe knew ſo well how to carry her ſelfe, ſo that none could ſuſpect her; yet, this did give her better confidence, becauſe in this condition, ſhe received the viſits of neighbours, who went all away in a full beliefe of her being <hi>Alexis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some daies paſſed on, in this manner; at the laſt, ſhe began to walk up and down the houſe, and to go abroad, pretending, that the freſh aire would conduce to her health. the ſeituation of the place was very pleaſing and delectable, having a view both of the Mountaines and Plaines, and the pleaſant River of <hi>Lignon,</hi> from <hi>Boen</hi> as far as <hi>Feures.</hi> This was the reaſon, why <hi>Pelion,</hi> the Father of <hi>Adamas,</hi> did chuſe that place to build in. And ſince that, <hi>Adamas</hi> had cauſed a very ſumptuous Tombe to be built, in memory of his Brother <hi>Belizar,</hi> and planted a pleaſant Grove, which almoſt joyned to the houſe, and extended it ſelfe towards the Mountaines. In this place, <hi>Alexis</hi> and <hi>Leonida</hi> went often to walk, becauſe of the pleaſant walks and proſpect; and becauſe they were to walk up a riſing Hill in the Woods, <hi>Alexis</hi> would ſometimes take <hi>Leonida</hi> under the arme, when they were not ſeen. And one time amongſt others, when they were up betimes in the morning, and <hi>Alexis</hi> did offer her that ſervice: This (ſaid the Nymph, and ſmiled) is a piece of ſervice, which you had rather do unto another, who perhaps wiſhes you not ſo well as I do. Oh Nymph, (ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> and ſighed) I beſeech you for gods-ſake, not to renew the remembrance of my miſeries; do you think I can forget them, having ſuch a deep reſentment of them as I have? Thus they diſcourſed till they were in the Grove, which being higher then the Houſe, did better diſcover all the plain, ſo as there was not a turn of the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> from <hi>Boen,</hi> where it fell from the Mountains, unto <hi>Fcurs</hi> where it fell into <hi>Loire,</hi> which they did not eaſily diſcover. This proſpect had ſuch an operation upon the ſuppoſed <hi>Alexis,</hi> that ſhe could not chuſe but ſay aloud: Oh my ſad eyes! how can you live, and endure the ſight of this happy River, where you have left all your contentment. <hi>Leonida</hi> deſiring to interrupt her I believe, ſaid ſhe, of all that ever loved, you are the only one, who does not delight to ſee the place, where you have had ſo much pleaſure: The memory of paſt miſeries is pleaſing to the thoughts, much more ſhould the memory of happineſſe received. The ſad <hi>Alexis</hi> anſwered; That which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the memory of miſeries paſt, to be pleaſing, is it, which makes the memory of happineſſe to be full of intolerable wormwood; for the conſideration of having paſt the miſeries, doth rejoyce; and the conſideration of having no more happineſſe, doth make one ſad. But my greateſt grief is, that I do not know the occaſion of my miſery; this conſideration, I ſwear unto you, <hi>Leonida,</hi> does wound me to my very ſoul: I have made a moſt exact examination of all my life, but I cannot finde one act which I can condemn. To think, that a light humour, or any deſigne of changing her affection, were in her, is too great an offence, and would give the lie unto thoſe convincing teſtimonies which I have to the contrary. To believe, that ſhe treats me thus without any reaſon, that would argue in me too little knowledge of her, of whoſe leaſt actions I have had full experience. What then can be the cauſe of my miſery? Oh ye gods! I think, that the tongue not being able to expreſſe the miſery, nor the thoughts able to comprehend the grandure of it, you will not let the underſtanding have a knowledge of it. Then continuing in theſe ſad thoughts: Do you ſee, great Nymph, ſaid ſhe, a little Iſle which <hi>Lignon</hi> makes, cloſe by yonder Town, which is beyond the River, a little neerer Mount <hi>Verdun,</hi> and a little diſtant from <hi>Julicu?</hi> There it was we paſſed over, by throwing great ſtones into the water, to ſtep upon, becauſe at that time we ſought out for the moſt ſecret places, to avoid the ſight of our Parents, eſpecially my Father; who finding no remedy againſt this affection, which he ſaw encreaſe before his face, he intended to ſend me out of <hi>Gaul</hi> over the <hi>Alps,</hi> to ſee the great Cities, thinking, that diſtance and abſence would have that operation upon me, which all his forbiddings and charges to the contrary could not effect: And becauſe we were advertiſed of it, we ſought out for the moſt obſcure and unfrequented places that we could finde, there to ſpend that ſhort time we had to be together, in free diſcourſe; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:53526:184"/>
becauſe of the conveniency of the place, we went into yonder Rock which you may ſee is ſomething neerer us, which is hollow, and left <hi>Lycidas</hi> or <hi>Phillis</hi> as Centinells, to advertiſe us when any paſſengers came by becauſe being neere a high way, we might be heard. At one time above the reſt, we paſſed over by great ſtones into this little Iſle of <hi>Lignon:</hi> And though we had already taken leave of one another ſeverall times, leſt we ſhould be ſurpriſed (for my Father concealed from me the day of my departure) yet ſtill we were taking leaves and bidding adieus to the laſt. When we were there, and could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no body, ſhe ſat downe upon the ground under a Tree: I kneeling before her, tooke her hand; kiſſed it, waſhed it with my teares; and as ſoone as I could ſpeake, I ſayd thus unto her.</p>
               <p>Now my faireſt <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I muſt be at a fatall diſtance from you, and will not die, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you bid me live: but how ſhall I be able to do it ſince the very thought of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is ſo intolerable, that it is ready to take away my life, as oft as I thinke upon you: To this ſhe anſwered nothing, but pulled me by the arme and made me ſit beſides her, purpoſely becauſe I ſhould not ſee thoſe teares which ſtood in her eyes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards guſhed out. And becauſe I expected ſhe ſhould ſay ſomething, I was a while mute: ſhe in the meane time wiped her eyes, and me thought I heard ſome impriſoned ſighes which ſhe reſtrained and would not let have a vent, leſt I ſhould heare them. I all this while, conſidering in ſilence my future fatall miſery, at laſt ſpoke thus unto her. Alas, my <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> will you not, will you not pitty a poore ſhepheard, whoſe cruell Father and fate will baniſh him from you? She anſwered me with a deepe ſigh: Can you have any memorie, Sonne, of my paſt life, and make any doubt, but that I ſhall moſt ſadly reſent any thing that ſhall diſpleaſe you? Beleeve it <hi>Celadon,</hi> I will make it apparent that I do love you, and ſhall give cleerer teſtimonies of it. I raiſed my ſelfe up, to ſee what teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this would be that ſhe would give me of her affection; but ſhe turned her head the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and with her fair hand puſhed me into the place where I ſat before, to the end I ſhould not ſee her teares, of which ſhe was in point of honour, aſhamed. Perhaps, ſaid <hi>Leonide,</hi> it was her lofty ſpirit, which would not let any know, that Love could conquer her.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever it was, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> ſhe made it evident unto me, that ſhe did love me. But why, my Faireſt <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> (ſaid I unto her) do you not command me to ſtay with you, if my abſence be diſpleaſing unto you? Can you think that the Command of a Father, or any thing upon earth can make me diſobey what you ordaine? Sonne, ſaid ſhe then unto me; I had rather die, then divert you from your voyage; It would be too great an offence both againſt your duty and my owne honour. Do not think I make any doubt of that abſolute power which I have over you: I judge of you by my ſelfe whom I am ſure, neither the power of Father, authority of Mother, deſire of Kindred, or ſalutation of Friends, ſhall ever make me do any thing againſt that affection which my heart has unto you. And to the end you may depart from me with ſome contentment, carry this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance with you, I do vow and promiſe in the preſence of all the gods whom I call to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and by this ſoul which you love ſo well (ſaid ſhe and layd her hand upon her Breſt) that neither heaven nor earth ſhall ever make me love any but <hi>Celadon,</hi> nor keep me from loving him eternally. Oh moſt ſtrange Language? (ſaid <hi>Alexis</hi> then and ſighed) ſtrange indeed they ſhould be ſpoken unto him who ſince was ſo out of favour.</p>
               <p>A few dayes after, I departed, and paſſed over the affrighting <hi>Precipices</hi> of the <hi>Sebucians, Caturgians, Bravomecians</hi> and <hi>Carrocleans</hi> as farre as the <hi>Seguiſians,</hi> where the very horrour of death did often appeare unto me, yet all theſe were not able to divert me from my thoughts. And having paſſed theſe, I deſired to avoyd the dangerous Mountain of <hi>Caturiges;</hi> therefore taking into the <hi>Roſne,</hi> I reſolved to go down that Lake, whoſe waves do beat againſt the ragged Rockes of this hideous Mountaine; but alas I found no more comfort by water then by Land; but on the contrary was in much greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death by bluſtering winds and waves, daſhing us againſt the Rockes: but all this while, my thoughts were ſtill the ſame.</p>
               <p>At the going out of this Lake, I croſſed through the great wood of <hi>Caturiges:</hi> And after I was paſt <hi>Iſeres,</hi> a River which comes from <hi>Centrons,</hi> I croſſed the ſtraight vallyes of <hi>Carroclees</hi> and <hi>Bramovices</hi> which conducted me as farre as the <hi>Cotian</hi> Hills<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Leonide</hi> being very deſirous to divert him from his ſad thoughts: I beſeech you, ſaid ſhe unto him, Relate what you have ſeene rare in your voyage: That, (anſwered <hi>Alexis)</hi> would be too long: for <hi>Italy</hi> is the very wonder of the world: But I ſhall relate unto you, one
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:53526:185"/>
very pleaſant adventure which I met withall. And I beleeve we ſhall have time enough for it.</p>

               <p>BE pleaſed to know therefore Madam, that <hi>Alcippes</hi> intending to ſend me far enough from <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> he commanded me to lay aſide the habit of a ſhepheard, that I might be more fit to keepe good company; for in thoſe Countryes perſons of any quality do all live in great Townes which they call Cittyes, where their Pallaces of Marble, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of furniture is able to amaze beholders: And none but vile perſons and Peaſants do live in the Country. Yet every one of the Province was extreamly affrighted at the comming of a Barbarian by Sea into <hi>Italy,</hi> who plundered almoſt all the Province, eſpecially <hi>Rome.</hi> I was ſo extreamly deſirous to render my ſelfe amiable, as hoping there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make <hi>Aſtrea</hi> love me the better, as I was ſtrangely ſwelled with curioſity to learne and enquire of every thing. Comming therefore neere the <hi>Appennine</hi> Hills, I heard that there was ſome Mountaines which burned continually: And that I might be the better able to give an account of them at my returne, I would needs ſee them But in my way thither, I met with an encounter which gave a ſtop to my deſigne: For I had not gone up the hills above two thouſand paces, or two miles as they call them there, but I heard a voyce which pittifully lamented, and becauſe I had a conceipt that happy it might be ſome who ſtood in need of helpe, I turned that way as my eare guided me. And I had not gone a hundred paces but I ſpyed a man lying all along upon the ground, who not ſeeing me, broke out into theſe expreſſions. Should I live, or ſhould I die, amidſt ſo many fatall misfortunes? If I live, how can I endure ſo many torments: And if I dye, alas I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee her again? Into what a miſerable condition has my fate hurryed me? Since I cannot be happy either in life nor death? Oh moſt miſerable <hi>Urſaces,</hi> (ſaid he) how long wilt thou ſuffer thy ſelfe to be thus flattered by vaine hopes? Why ſhould they let thee paſſe away thy dayes in ſuch cruell torments? And how canſt thou preſerve a life that is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of thy actions and thy corrage? Thou that haſt a heart ſo daring as to lift thy eyes ſo high as <hi>Caeſars</hi> wife, thou that hadſt ſo much corrage as to revenge thy love, and embrue thy hands in the blood of both, art thou now growne ſo faintly timerous as to live and ſee the deare <hi>Eudoxe</hi> in the hands of a Vandall, who has carried her into the heart of <hi>Affrica</hi> and perhaps has a deſigne upon her chaſtity?

               <p>Thus paſſionately did this ſtranger expreſſe himſelfe; and being tranſported with fury he drew a ſhort ſword which hung by his ſide, and doubtleſſe had run himſelfe to the heart, if a companion of his had not run in and taken hold of his arme, juſt as he was ready to give the mortall thruſt; but in ſaving the life of his friend his hand was very dangerouſly cut: For <hi>Urſaces</hi> perceiving himſelfe ſeized upon, and his mind being prepoſſeſſed with the thought of death he made his thruſt, and gave his friend a very great wound: So as this friend not being able to hold him with that hand, and fearing he ſhould execute his cruell deſigne, he fell upon him, ſaying, <hi>Urſaces</hi> ſhall never die as long as <hi>Olimbres</hi> lives: A brave reſolution of a friend: At the name of <hi>Olimbres,</hi> I ſaw the other man who was before ſo paſſionatly tranſported, preſently come to himſelfe, and as if he had got a fall from the top of a high precipice was aſtoniſhed at the coming of the other.

your deſigne, firſt thruſt that ſword in thy hand into the heart of thy friend, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when it is red, and reeking with my blood, execute thy deſigne, or do what thou wilt. Ah <hi>Olimbres,</hi> ſaid he, this requeſt is incompatible with our friendſhip: Can you think, my hand has any power to hurt <hi>Urſaces</hi>'s friend? Think me not ſo cruell, as ever to conſent unto the death of him, whoſe life was ever deerer to me then my own. But, if you have any compaſſion upon my miſery, I conjure you by our pure friendſhip, to let me go out of this miſerable life. Can you think, ſaid <hi>Olimbres,</hi> that I will not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly follow you? Have I not courage enough, to take away my life, that I may follow yours wel as you follow <hi>Eudoxe?</hi> Do you think Death to be good or bad? If it be bad why wil you give it unto him, whom <hi>Olimbres,</hi> your friend, loves deerer then himſelfe? If it be good, why will you not let <hi>Olimbres,</hi> whom you love, be a partaker with you? Oh, no, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Urſaces, Olimbres</hi> ſhall live to eternity, before he die by the hand of <hi>Urſaces:</hi>

                  </gap>, it will be a great teſtimony of friendſhip, to let me execute my deſigne, which only can wipe off my ſhame, in ſurviving my happineſſe. In ſaying theſe words, he endeavoured to draw out his arme, which his friend had engaged under his body: Which I perceiving, and fearing, that he who was wounded had not ſtrength to hinder him, I went gently up to them, and taking the hand of <hi>Urſaces,</hi> I forced open his fingers, and ſeized upon his ſword. And <hi>Olimbres</hi>'s ſtriving, had cauſed him to loſe much blood. He preſently perceived himſelfe to faint; and apprehending, that the loſſe of his blood was the cauſe, he aroſe from off his Companion, and ſhewed him his hand: Friend, ſaid he unto him, I am ready to wait upon you to <hi>Eudoxe;</hi> and if you will die, I ſhall think my ſelfe happy to follow you. Then preſently he fainted, and fell into his friends boſome. <hi>Urſaces</hi> fearing the loſſe of him, he left off all thoughts of killing himſelfe, to help his friend, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning unto a Fountain which was cloſe by, he brought ſome water in his hat, to throw in his face. In the mean time, I knowing that his diſeaſe proceeded from loſſe of blood, I took a little moſſe, for want of a better remedy, and applying it to the wound, I tyed it up with my handkerchiefe, and had not done, when <hi>Urſaces</hi> returned, who ſprinkling the face of his friend with told water, and calling upon him with a loud voice by his name, he brought him to himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. When he opened his eyes: Alas friend, (ſaid he) why did you call me? Let my ſoule go contentedly out of the world, and let it attend you whereſoever you go: Have this beliefe, I beſeech you, that ſhe cannot cloſe up her daies more happily, then by your hand, and in doing you ſervice. <hi>Olimbres,</hi> ſaid <hi>Urſaces,</hi> if you do depart to follow me, I muſt go before you; and therefore never think, that my hand ſhall make any paſſage for your ſoul, untill it hath with the ſame ſword ſent mine out of this miſerable habitation. Upon this, he looked about for the ſword which I had taken away; Which I perceiving: Do not think, <hi>Urſaces,</hi> (ſaid I unto him) to execute your cruell determination with this ſword; heaven hath ſent me hither to tell you, that there is nothing in this world ſo deſperate, which it cannot remit unto its former condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when it pleaſeth; and hath alſo ſent me to hinder you, from making any attempts upon the life, either of your ſelfe or your friend, for your life is his, not yours: But if you do attempt any thing againſt your life, I tell you from the great god, that in lieu of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing this <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> which you do ſo paſſionately deſire, he will lead your ſoul into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall obſcurity, and quite take away your very memory. I ſhall now, Nymph, (ſaid <hi>Alexis)</hi> relate unto you a moſt ſtrange effect. <hi>Olimbres</hi> hearing theſe words, was ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed with joy, that he would needs riſe, and fall upon his knees before me; but his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hindred him, only he turned towards me, and held up his hands: But <hi>Urſaces</hi> did proſtrate himſelfe at my feet: Oh thou welcome meſſenger from heaven, (ſaid he unto me) I know thou art ſo, both by thy voice and countenance; here I am, moſt ready to obey, whatſoever thou commandeſt. Perhaps (ſaid <hi>Leonida)</hi> they took you for <hi>Mercury,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they uſe to repreſent him young and fair, as you are 'Tis true, anſwered <hi>Alexis,</hi> they did take me, either for <hi>Mercury,</hi> or ſome Celeſtiall Meſſenger. I know not why, but to keep them in that opinion, I gave this anſwer unto <hi>Urſaces:</hi> god, O <hi>Urſaces,</hi> doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee, and <hi>Olimbres</hi> alſo, to live and hope. Upon this, taking out of my pocket a little leather Bottle of ſtrong-Water, after the faſhion of the <hi>Viſigots,</hi> I cauſed <hi>Olimbres</hi> to drink a little, and giving him my hand, I ſaid unto him: Stand up, <hi>Olimbres,</hi> the heavens will quickly cure thee of this wound, and therefore let us go unto the next Town. It was very ſtrange, to ſee what effects this conceit did produce in this man; for, thinking that I was ſent from heaven, and thinking, that the hot Water which I gave him, was
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:53526:186"/>
ſomething that was divine, he took ſuch heart and ſtrength, that he followed me almoſt as well, as if he had received no hurt; yet I fearing leſt he ſhould faint again, I turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Vrſaces,</hi> and ſaid unto him: Although the heavens are able to give ſuch ſtrength to your friend as is neceſſary, yet it would not be amiſſe, that you took him by the arme, and holped him to walk; for god is pleaſed to ſee men help one another, through the effects of his goodneſſe. Upon this, <hi>Vrſaces</hi> went to his friend, and deſired him to lean upon him; ſo as we came to the next Town, where by fortune we found a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, who dreſſed the hand of <hi>Olimbres,</hi> and appointed him to keep his bed for a certain time.</p>
               <p>As for me, I retired my ſelfe into another Lodging, very glad that I had done this good office, although it was a hinderance unto my deſigne; for the day was ſo far ſpent, that I had not time enough to go and ſee thoſe burning Mountains. <hi>Urſaces</hi> was very ſorry when he ſaw me depart, for he had a great deſire to accompany me; but the Lawes of friendſhip would not let him leave his friend in that condition. I did plainly perceive his deſire, and to take him off it, I told him; That he muſt needs ſtay with his friend, and not to ſtand upon the circumſtance of complement; for, as for me, the gods would reward me, for the aſſiſtance I had brought them. If I would have ſuffered it, I think he would have throwne himſelfe at my feet, by way of thanks; but I forbad him, and preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired my ſelfe into another Lodging. But <hi>Urſaces</hi> following me, he obſerved the place where I entred, and hearing me ask for Lodging, he returned to his friend, to tell him, that though I was gone out of their Lodging, yet I was not gone out of the Town, therefore hoped I would ſee them again: For, great Nymph, they had ſuch an aſſured confidence in me and my aſſiſtance, as they aſſured themſelves, that by my help, they ſhould ere long ſee <hi>Eudoxe.</hi> But <hi>Urſaces</hi> finding his friend aſleep, he preſently returned to the place where I was; and ſeeing me at my repaſt he ſtood a little amazed; but when the cloth was taken away, and we two alone together, I bad him ſhut the Chamber dore: Afterwards, though with much ado, I cauſed him to ſit down, and to put him out of his errour, I ſaid thus unto him: I perceive, noble Cavalier; that the aſſiſtance which you have received from me, has made you think me ſomething above a man; and I am not ſorry that you have this opinion, to the end I might divert you from your horrid intention. But now, ſince I ſee you reduced unto former reaſon again, I will no longer keep you in your errour. Know therefore, that I am a <hi>Celt,</hi> whom you do call a <hi>Gaul,</hi> born in a Country, the Inhabitants whereof are called <hi>Seguſians</hi> and <hi>Forreſtians:</hi> Certain occaſions, which would be too long, and uſeleſſe to you, to relate, have brought me out of my native-Country, and invited me to remain here in <hi>Italy</hi> for a certain time. Yet, I do take it for a particular providence from heaven, that I was ſo happily conducted to the place where you were, ſince ſuch good effects enſue upon it: I give heaven moſt humble and hearty thanks for it, and you are obliged to the like; for, you may be moſt certainly aſſured, that god would not have reſcued you ſo ſtrangely from the very brink of death, if he had not reſerved you for ſomething, either to his glory, or your own honour &amp; contentment. I ſaw, that <hi>Urſaces</hi> grew pale at theſe words, and changed colour two or three times, ſeeing himſelfe miſtaken in his hopes, that it had been ſome divine aſſiſtance. I muſt confeſſe, ſaid he unto me, that I was deceived; for, ſeeing you in a habit different from ours, your face ſo fair, hearing your voice ſo ſweet, and your ſpeech ſo grave; moreover, you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming inviſibly upon us, and in ſuch a nick of time, I muſt needs confeſſe, I took you for ſome meſſenger from the great god: But, ſince I underſtand from your own mouth, that you are but a man, mortall as we are, I do believe it; yet believe withall, that you were ſent by that great god, only to preſerve the life of two moſt faithful friends. And though in my firſt opinion, I hoped for ſome extraordinary aſſiſtance from heaven; yet now, in this opinion wherein I am, I will not be quite out of hopes in you, ſince it cannot be denyed, but that there was ſome extraordinary and particular care of us and our lives, which comes from ſome great god, or great angell, who has made you the Inſtrument of it. Do not doubt, ſaid I unto him, but that you are reſerved for ſome better fortune, ſince you are in ſo ſtrange a manner preſerved from eminent danger; for, the gods never do any thing, but for our good. And becauſe I am a ſtranger to you, and altogether ignorant of that fortune, which you did ſo much condole, I ſhould be very glad to hear it from your own mouth, that I may know who it is whom the gods have ſent me to preſerve. Then with a a deep ſigh, he anſwered me thus: The heavens had reaſon to puniſh me, as the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull perſon that ever breathed, if I ſhould deny the relation of my whole life unto
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:53526:186"/>
him that hath preſerved it. I ſhall therefore moſt willingly ſatisfie your curioſity, upon a promiſe of ſecreſie; for being diſcovered, it may coſt the loſſe of that life, which you have preſerved. And upon aſſurance of ſecreſie, he continued thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexis</hi> would have continued her diſcourſe, and related all that <hi>Vrſaces</hi> told her, but the comming of <hi>Adamas</hi> gave a ſtop unto her; for both <hi>Leonida</hi> and ſhe were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to riſe, and render that honour unto him which was due. The ſage Druide, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one in one hand, and the other in another, he began to walk in a Laund, which though ſhaded from the Sun, yet had a moſt delicious proſpect towards the Wood of <hi>Iſſoures:</hi> And whilſt they were diſcourſing upon ſeverall ſubjects, one came to acquaint them that <hi>Silvia</hi> was arrived, and already entred into the houſe. <hi>Alexis</hi> was very ſhie, and would not be ſeen, leſt ſhe ſhould be known; but conſidering, how willing that Nymph was to help her out of the Palace of <hi>Iſſoures,</hi> ſhe hoped ſhe was not changed: Yet <hi>Adamas</hi> had no minde that <hi>Silvia</hi> ſhould ſee her, fearing, leſt the young years of that Nymph, and the favours which ſhe lately received from <hi>Galathea,</hi> ſhould make her ſpeak more then ſhe ſhould; he would have kept the matter ſo cloſe, that if he could, he would have kept it from his very ſelfe. Therefore he commanded <hi>Leonida</hi> to go unto her Companion, but be ſure, that if ſhe deſired to ſee <hi>Alexis,</hi> to tell her, that they were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie together concerning their Offices, and that ſhe being to return very ſhortly unto <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,</hi> and finiſh out her terme, ſhe would not be ſeen, but as little as poſſibly ſhe could. So <hi>Leonida</hi> thus inſtructed, went to <hi>Silvia,</hi> who when they met, kiſſed and embraced each other, as if they had not met of ſeven years before. After theſe firſt complements, <hi>Silvia</hi> told her Companion, that the Country had not a jot blaſted the freſh comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion of her cheek. And <hi>Leonida,</hi> in requitall, told her, The Court Beauties were alwaies above the Country Complexions, as plainly appeared, by comparing theirs together. Afterwards, <hi>Silvia</hi> ſaid thus unto her.</p>

               <p>THough, Siſter, I had no buſineſſe to invite me unto a viſit; yet, my deſires of ſeeing you are invitations ſufficient. But I muſt tell you, that at this time, that deſire was not only my conductor, but alſo ſome buſineſſe I would impart unto you, and, if you think good, unto <hi>Adamas</hi> alſo; a buſineſs which I thought fit to let you know, becauſe <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi> and we may receive much contentment, or much diſpleaſure by the reſult of it. Know therefore, Siſter, that <hi>Flurial</hi> is returned from the place whither you ſent him, and hath brought Letters from <hi>Lindamor;</hi> and wondred much, not to finde you at <hi>Marcelles,</hi> and would have come hither; but <hi>Galathea</hi> took notice, that he talked unto me, and ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting that you ſent him to me, for ſhe knew of the journey which you had commanded him to make, ſhe called him to her, asked him, from whence he came, and what was his buſineſſe to me. He, thinking he had don well, without concealing any thing, anſwered her, that he came from <hi>Lindamor;</hi> and preſently ſhewed her ſome Letters which he had. She asking, who ſent him that voyage: He anſwered, that it was you, ſince we were at the Palace of <hi>Iſsoures. Galathea</hi> then turning towards me, and ſhaking her head: Do you ſee, ſaid ſhe, what humour your Companion is of? And, refuſing the Letters, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to give them unto me, to ſend unto you. Afterwards ſhe went into her Chamber, and commanded me to follow her. This was the reaſon, that I could not ſay any thing unto <hi>Fluriall,</hi> but only taking his Letters, I bad him ſtay there, till I had done talking with the Nymph. What do you think of your Companion, ſaid ſhe unto me? is ſhe not fully reſolved to do me all the miſchiefe ſhe can? Madam, ſaid I unto her, I cannot tell what to ſay unto it, ſhe muſt be talked with, to know what her buſineſſe and deſigne was. I know it (replyed ſhe) better then ſhe will tell you, for ſhe will not confeſſe unto you the truth; ſhe has acquainted <hi>Lindamor</hi> with my love unto <hi>Celadon.</hi> Can it be poſſible, Madam, anſwered I, that ſhe ſhould take ſo much pains, as to write that newes ſo far, and by ſuch a dangerous way? See what is in <hi>Lindamors</hi> Letters, (ſaid ſhe unto me) and I believe you will finde, that I do not lie. Then taking the Letters out of my hand, ſhe broke open the Seales and read them: The firſt was directed unto you, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving brought them, you may read them.

               <p>See, ſaid <hi>Galathea</hi> unto me, (continued <hi>Silvia)</hi> what I alwaies moſt feared: The imprudence of <hi>Leonida,</hi> or rather, her malice, is ſo great, that ſhe has told <hi>Lindamor</hi> of my affection unto <hi>Celadon;</hi> and this report is the cauſe, that he will come and kill him. I had rather die, then that ſhepheard ſhould receive the leaſt harm for my ſake. Alas, how eaſily may hee do it, ſince the poor ſhepheard never thinks upon it, nor has any Armes, but his ſheephook? Can there be a more pernicious malice then hers, in procuring his death, who never diſpleaſed her? I believe rather, it is rage; for ſhe loves him, and becauſe he ſleights her, ſhe will be revenged. Madam, anſwered I, I cannot believe, that my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion has committed this fault, though perhaps ſhe may as great; for, upon reading of <hi>Lindamor</hi>'s Letter, I cannot think he ſpeaks of <hi>Celadon,</hi> but <hi>Polemas;</hi> for why ſhould he phraſe <hi>Celadon</hi> perfidious? And why not <hi>Celadon,</hi> (replyed ſhe preſently) as well as <hi>Polemas?</hi> Becauſe, Madam, ſaid I unto her, ſhe has acquainted <hi>Lindamor</hi> with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, which <hi>Polemas</hi> practiſed with the falſe and counterfeit Druide. And why, <hi>Silvia,</hi> (ſaid ſhe unto me) do you yet believe, that <hi>Leonida</hi> told you or <hi>Lindamor</hi> truly, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that Druide? Do you not know, that it was meerly a device of her own pernicious invention, to make me caſt off <hi>Celadon,</hi> that ſhe her ſelfe might ſolely enjoy him? Now let me tell you, if you do not know it already, that ſhe is ſo extreamly in love with him, that ſhe cannot endure I ſhould look upon him: And had ſhe as much power over me, as I have over her, ſhe would never have ſuffered me to come into the place where ſhe was. Did you never obſerve <hi>Silvia,</hi> how ſhe feeds upon him with her eyes, if I may ſo expreſſe my ſelfe, and to look off him, is a death unto her? To ſee me neer him, ſtruck her to the heart, and ſwelled every vein with jealouſie. I have many a time obſerved, the variety of paſſions that are in her; I have ſeen her ſometimes, no fire hotter, and immediately upon a ſudden, as pale as death; ſometimes ſhe would be all talk, and afterwards as mute as if ſhe had not tongue. I have often ſeen her ſo fix her eyes upon him, as if ſhe would have look'd him through, and I have laughed at her in thoſe extaſies and raviſhments. And ſhe, deſiring to engroſſe him wholly to her ſelfe, and take me off, has invented this tale ſhe hath told you, which is as falſe, as the gods are juſt and true. Upon this, ſhe took another of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor</hi>'s Letters, which was directed to her ſelfe, which you may read, (ſaid <hi>Silvia):</hi> Which <hi>Leonida</hi> took, and found in it theſe words.</p>

of mine: but rather that Traitor <hi>Polemas,</hi> who is the cauſe of all our miſery. May <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> puniſh him by armes, and <hi>Tamaris</hi> by Thunderbolt, that my Lady may know, I did not lie when I related unto her the wickedneſſe of <hi>Climanthe</hi> and the coſening Lover For every ſyllable I ſaid unto her is true: If I did lye let the Sacred <hi>Miſleto</hi> never be Salubrious unto me. To be brief, Siſter, I ſweare by all thats Sacred that this is true: And though I do not care for returning unto <hi>Marcelles</hi> as long as ſhe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues in this humour, yet I ſhall be very glad you would take all occaſions and uſe your beſt endeavours to let her ſee her errour. Not for any other end, but becauſe I would vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate my honour, and live within the compaſſe of my owne quality without reproach. Siſter, ſaid <hi>Silvia,</hi> you need not uſe ſo many othes to aſſure me of the ſubtility of <hi>Polemas,</hi> For I did ever beleeve it, both from what you told me, and from my owne obſervation of his actions. And you may beleeve, I will take all occaſions, uſe my beſt Arguments, and not leave one ſtone unturned to perſwade the Nymph of the truth. But I muſt not flatter you in this; For I cannot hope either any words or perſwaſions will work with her, untill her minde be better ſettled, which perhaps will be too late, unleſſe God ſend ſome unlookt for meanes: For I ſee that <hi>Polemas</hi> hath a bad deſigne, which he would not hide, but for his feares that he hath of <hi>Clideman</hi> and <hi>Lindamor,</hi> whom he knowes to be armed, and ſo much in favour with King <hi>Childerick</hi> who is ſucceſſor unto the great <hi>Meroveus</hi> and who has a very great particular love unto <hi>Clideman</hi> and <hi>Lindamor,</hi> eſpecially unto <hi>Guyemant,</hi> ſo as he cannot be without them. <hi>Polemas</hi> being ſubtile and crafty, does feare that if ſhe ſhould attempt any novelty in the State, theſe <hi>Frankes</hi> would by force ruine all his deſignes. But to let Matters of State alone which ſhould be medled with by more able perſons then we are: Let me tell you, Siſter, that when <hi>Galathea</hi> read <hi>Lindamors</hi> Letter, ſhe plainly found that <hi>Celadon</hi> was not in danger: therefore halfe of her anger was over. Did I not tell you Madam (ſaid I unto her) That <hi>Lindamor</hi> did meane <hi>Polemas?</hi> Tis very true, (ſaid ſhe unto me) and I confeſſe that I accuſed <hi>Leonida</hi> wrongfully: but it was my compaſſion unto that poore ſhepheard which moved me unto that language. Madam ſayd I, I beſeech you beleeve, that <hi>Leonide</hi> would willingly never do you that diſpleaſure; but ſhe knowing very well that you did not love <hi>Polemas,</hi> ſhe had good reaſon to deſire that <hi>Lindamor</hi> might obtaine the happineſſe of your favour; becauſe there is a neere relation of Kindered betwixt her and him. For be pleaſed to know Madam, that <hi>Lindamor</hi> is of the illuſtrious blood of <hi>Lavieu,</hi> and ſhe of <hi>Fieur,</hi> which have bin ſo long linked together by alliances that thoſe two families ſeeme but one. On the contrary, there was ever emnity betwixt the houſe of <hi>Surieu</hi> and that, ſo as ſhe may well be excuſed, if ſhe did deſire and endeavour to defeat <hi>Polemas</hi> from the happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which he pretended unto. I do know (anſwered <hi>Galathea)</hi> that there hath beene great emnity betweene the houſe of <hi>Lavieu</hi> and <hi>Surieu:</hi> and ſince the combate betwixt <hi>Lindamor</hi> and <hi>Polemas,</hi> there hath been no amity betwixt them: And I muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, <hi>Leonida</hi> has reaſon for what ſhe did, for it is Naturall to deſire that the Family from whence any do derive themſelves, may flouriſh and be advanced. And had I knowne it ſooner, I ſhould not have taken her protection of <hi>Lindamor</hi> ſo ill, whether it was againſt <hi>Polemas</hi> or againſt <hi>Celadon:</hi> Alſo when I conſider upon what you tell me, I am apt to beleve that it was <hi>Adamas</hi> who helped <hi>Celadon</hi> to eſcape, to the end that <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor</hi> being as you ſay his coſen might arrive at his deſire, and I do think <hi>Leonida</hi> to be innocent in the matter. Therefore in that conſideration, and becauſe ſhe did not ſend unto <hi>Lindamor</hi> any of our paſſages in the Pallace of <hi>Iſſoures,</hi> I will pardon her: yet, ſaid ſhe, we muſt make further uſe of her in a buſineſſe, which by her meanes may be effected. Here <hi>Silvia</hi> ſtopt; and leaving her diſcourſe upon that ſubject, ſaid thus unto <hi>Leonide:</hi> You ſee Siſter, that I do hide nothing from you, becauſe our friendſhip bids me be open unto you, but if you ſhould diſcover me, I am utterly ruin'd: And therefore I beſeech you be as ſecret in it as poſſible you can: I had rather I were eternally dumb, (ſaid <hi>Leonida)</hi> then I ſhould commit ſuch a fault. Know then (continued <hi>Silvia)</hi> that <hi>Galathea</hi> after ſhe had well bethought herſelfe, ſaid thus unto me; you ſee, <hi>Silvia,</hi> how extreamly I am troubled with theſe two men, I meane <hi>Lindamor</hi> and <hi>Polemas;</hi> and I muſt confeſſe that whoſoever would rid me of them, would infinitly oblige me. For I am ſure they will never let me be in any quietneſs, nor ſuffer <hi>Celadon</hi> to be neere me: And therefore I would try if I could be ſhut of one by meanes of the other, which may be effected by the mediation of <hi>Leonide,</hi> whom I would have you counſell, to acquaint <hi>Lindamour</hi> with all that <hi>Climan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the</hi> ſaid concerning him: but to take eſpeciall care that ſhe do not thinke I have any thoughts of <hi>Celadon.</hi> And to the end ſhe may thinke, if I have not quite forgotten that
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:53526:188"/>
ſhepherd you may tell her that the preſence of <hi>Lindamor</hi> who is a man of ſo much Merit will make me forget him: by this meanes <hi>Lindamor</hi> will either deſtroy <hi>Polemas,</hi> or <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> him. So ſhall I be rid of one, at the leaſt, and both if good fortune's favour be ſo much, as that one kill theother. I do not deſire this ſhould be by death, but rather be rid of them ſome other way. But I am ſo extreamly peſtered with them, and do love <hi>Celadon</hi> ſo well, that if there be none other remedy, I conſent unto it, ſo it be not by my hand, or knowne that it proceeds from me.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſſe Siſter, that when I heard theſe words, I was aſtoniſhed, and reſolved to acquaint you, not to incite you unto what ſhe deſires, but rather to divert you. I anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Nymph, that it was firſt requiſite to know of <hi>Flurial</hi> what time <hi>Lindamor</hi> ſaid he would come; which ſhe thought to be expedient, and therefore commanded me to call him: which I did: but before he ſpoke unto her, I charged him not to tell <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi> the time of his comming nor the place where he would be: and that if ſhe asked him, he ſhould ſay, that he would come much latter then the time he told him. Though the fellow had no great matter of wit, yet he had ſome apprehenſions which made him ſtagger at my perſwaſions; yet at laſt he harkened unto them: then I brought him to her, and he lyed ſo confidently, that ſhe beleeved him. And becauſe ſhe thought it expedient that I ſhould come unto you, to get you to write unto <hi>Lindamor,</hi> or at leaſt to let him know what <hi>Polemas</hi> had done againſt him; I thought good to bring <hi>Flurial</hi> with me, that he might tell you more then perhaps he would me but he feares that you are angry with him for ſo ſimply giving your Letters unto <hi>Galathea,</hi> that he dare not come in your ſight. Now me thinks that though he did very ſimply in it, yet he ought not to be ſo chid for it as to loſe him. True (ſaid <hi>Leonide)</hi> and perhaps he hath not done ſo much hurt as he thinkes, ſince by his meanes <hi>Galathea</hi> hath read <hi>Lindamors</hi> Letter which I ſhould not have dared to preſent unto her, leaſt ſhe ſhould have baniſhed me as ſhe hath already. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him therefore, that I am not at all angry with him but rather pleaſed, <hi>Silvia</hi> upon this, went out and called for <hi>Flurial</hi> whom ſhe told what ſhe had done; and afterwards brought him unto <hi>Leonida</hi> who looked upon him very kindly, and aſſured him that ſhe was nothing diſpleaſed with him: Then asking him every particular of his voyage, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to anſwere thus.</p>
               <p>I was afraid, Madam, that I had committed a fault, and therefore beſeeched <hi>Silvia</hi> to make my excuſe but ſince, thankes be to Cod, it proves otherwiſe, I am moſt heartily glad of it, and thinke it to be the greateſt happineſſe that could come unto me: For I have vowed my ſelfe ſo much unto the ſervice of <hi>Lindamor</hi> that though he may perhaps find me failing in my wit and diſcretion, yet never in my fidelity and affection. Therefore as ſoon as I had your commands upon me to go unto him, I went with as much haſte as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly I could and came unto a City called <hi>Paris,</hi> where <hi>Meroveus</hi> then was, being returned from the <hi>Neuſtrian</hi> Country: This City is ſeated in an Iſle, ſo as the walls about it are waſhed with a River which runs round on all ſides of it: And ſo as there is no comming to it but by bridges. As ſoon as he ſaw me, I obſerved a great alteration in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance but he being in bed then, and having many perſons about him, he could not ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, nor aske me the occaſion of my voyage: But when he was alone, he called for me: and asking what buſineſſe brought me thither, I told him, that he would be beſt informed by your Letter. Is there none (ſaith he preſently) from my Lady? You will know all (anſwered I) by that Letter. He changed colour when I ſaid ſo unto him: thinking that certainly there was ſome great alteration or other in the wind, but when he had read your Letter I never ſaw a man ſo amaz'd I cannot tell what was in that paper, but it was like to have coſt him his life. I do remember, ſaid <hi>Leomda,</hi> the very words: they were but ſhort, and therefore Siſter, I would have you heare them, that you may acquaint <hi>Galathea</hi> with them, if you think it requiſite.</p>

               <p>You gave him, ſaid <hi>Silvia,</hi> a very hot alarme, and I do not wonder he ſhould bluſh when he redd it; for, ſuch newes might very well cauſe the like effects. How could I write any leſſe, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> is it not true? For my part, I cannot tell a lie, eſpecially to my friends, and ſuch as truſt in me. Your words replyed <hi>Flurial,</hi> were very effectuall. By fortune, there was none with him, unleſſe a young man who waited upon him in his Chamber. He had ſuch a command over his ſorrowes, as he reſtrained his complaints, till he had commanded this young man and my ſelfe to retire, and wait in his Wardrobe, untill he called for us: Then cauſing the Curtains to be drawn, he began to ſigh ſo loud, that though the dore was ſhut, yet we could hear him. Then I enquired, what was the cauſe of keeping his bed, and I underſtood, that it was by reaſon of ſome wounds he had received in a skirmiſh, wherein the <hi>Neuſtrians</hi> were defeated by the valour of <hi>Clidaman</hi> and <hi>Lindamor;</hi> and becauſe I was very inquiſitive after newes, and deſired to know all paſſages, the young man made this relation to me.</p>
               <p>I believe, <hi>Fluriall,</hi> (ſaid he unto me, for he knew my name, having often ſeen me in the Gardens of <hi>Mount-Briſon,</hi> and in his Maſters Chamber, when you ſent me to him) that you have heard of the Battles that have been wone from the <hi>Neuſtrians</hi> by the King; yet, with the aſſiſtance of <hi>Clidaman</hi> and my Maſter. I aſſure my ſelf alſo, that you have heard talk of a Lady, (he did name her (ſaid he unto <hi>Leonida)</hi> but I have forgot it) who putting her ſelfe into the habit of a man, did follow beyond the Sea a <hi>Neuſtrian,</hi> whom ſhe loved, and who reſembled <hi>Ligdamon</hi> ſo much, who was taken for him, and dyed, becauſe he would not marry a woman, for whom that man fought, and killed a man, for which Murther being baniſhed, he fled into a Country beyond Sea, I cannot hit upon the name of it; and afterwards upon his return, was Priſoner, by a kinſman of him that was killed: And had it not been for this Lady of whom I mean, he had been put into the hands of Juſtice; but ſhe fought for him, and ſtayed in Priſon her ſelfe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe him.</p>
               <p>This intricate tale of <hi>Flurial's,</hi> made the Nymphs to laugh; though <hi>Silvia,</hi> in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> and <hi>Leonida</hi> alſo, had a good minde to help him out: Thou doſt mean, <hi>Flurial,</hi> ſaid <hi>Silvia,</hi> the fair <hi>Melander.</hi> True, true, ſaid he, that's her name. And <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias,</hi> continued the Nymph, who was kept in <hi>Calice</hi> by <hi>Lypandas,</hi> becauſe of <hi>Arontes</hi> his death. The very ſame, (ſaid <hi>Fluriall,</hi> and clapped his hands together) but I ſhall never remember their names, and therefore I ſhall finiſh my relation, upon condition, that you will help me out. Now, this Lady (continued he) was the cauſe of <hi>Calice</hi> being taken by the <hi>Francks,</hi> and <hi>Lypandas</hi> (I cannot tell whether I name him right) was made a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. As for <hi>Melander,</hi> who was in Priſon, as ſoon as ever ſhe was releaſed, ſhe would go unto <hi>Lydias,</hi> thinking that <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> who was in the hands of his enemies, had been <hi>Lydias,</hi> as every one reported him to be. As ſoon as <hi>Lydias</hi> heard of this Ladies depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he followed after her, not fearing any ſeverity of enemies, nor rigour of juſtice. But <hi>Lypandas,</hi> who was in Priſon, knowing that he had kept a Woman Priſoner, and that he had fought with her, he fell ſo in love with her, that he never left ſoliciting, till he obtained his liberty, and then went as faſt as he could to the Town whither ſhe was gone; I have quite forgot the name of it, for it was a very hard word. Was it not <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomages,</hi> ſaid <hi>Leonida?</hi> The very ſame, ſaid <hi>Flurial.</hi> Oh god, what fine ſtories could I tell you, if I had a good memory. But ſo it was, that the King's Son fell upon ſome of the Enemies, and defeated them, after a long Combat, in which <hi>Lindamor</hi> was ſo woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he was forced to keep his bed. Truly, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> you are an excellent ſtory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teller, and therefore I pray proceed. My memory, ſaid he, is not ſo as I wiſh it; but I had rather not tell many things, then lie.</p>
               <p>Now whilſt this young man told me theſe things, <hi>Lindamor</hi> ſighed, and ſometimes ſpoke; but I could not poſſibly hear what he ſaid, becauſe the dore was ſhut: At the laſt, I heard him call me, and not drawing the Curtains, he ſaid unto me: <hi>Fluriall,</hi> I would have thee return to morrow, and I would be before thee, if I could endure a Horſe-back, but I will preſently follow thee; tell <hi>Leonida,</hi> that I will come to the houſe of <hi>Adamas,</hi> and it ſhall be within this twenty nights at the leaſt, if my wounds will give me leave. Upon this, he commanded me to take my reſt. But I was much aſtoniſhed, when they told me that very ſame night, that they thought him dead two or three times, and
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:53526:189"/>
that his wounds were ſo much changed upon a ſudden, that he was in great danger of his life. I do believe, that the Letter which you writ, was the cauſe: He continued long in this condition, ſo as I could not be diſpatched of a month after, within which time, he grew better, and not in ſo much danger. Beſides his wounds, he had ſuch a Feavour, as cauſed him very often to talk lightly, and ordinarily name <hi>Galathea, Leonida,</hi> and <hi>Polemas;</hi> Love, revenge death. At the laſt he recovered, but not ſo well, as to go out of his bed; and the Phyſicians told him, that he muſt not ſtir out of his Chamber, at the leaſt of fifteen nights: And therefore he diſpatched me, ſaying, that before the ſixteenth of the next Month, he would be here, and gave me the Letters which you have ſeen; comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me to tell you many fine words, which did only ſignifie thanks, and which, in good faith, Madam, I have quite forgotten.</p>
               <p>The Nymphs could not chuſe but laugh at <hi>Fluria</hi>'s diſcourſe, and good memory: And becauſe they would talk together, they commanded him to go out, and ſtay till <hi>Silvia</hi> returned, eſpecially to have a great care he told none, when <hi>Lindamor</hi> would be back. Then being alone together, they reſolved to tell <hi>Galathea</hi> plainly, the truth of that voyage, hoping, that perhaps the merits of <hi>Lindamor</hi> would make her more conſiderate; but by all means to conceal from her the time of his comming, leſt if ſhe ſhould know it, ſhe ſhould advertiſe <hi>Polemas;</hi> not out of any good-will unto him, but only that he might ſtand upon his guard, and that <hi>Lindamor</hi> intending to kill him, they might be both in a poſſibility of dying; or that ſo acquainting him with the deſigne of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> he might challenge him the field, and there die. This then being the deſigne, <hi>Silvia</hi> thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, to communicate the matter unto the ſage <hi>Adamas;</hi> and to know his opinion: But <hi>Leonida</hi> told her, that ſhe would acquaint him with it at leaſure; but now, he was very buſie with his Daughter. And ſhall not I ſee her, ſaid <hi>Silvia?</hi> It will not be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient at this time, ſaid <hi>Leonida;</hi> for they are both exceedingly buſie, becauſe it is not much above a month, before the Druides aſſemble at <hi>Dreux:</hi> And I do believe, that for this year, my Uncle will be exempted, becauſe of his Daughter, whom he will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to bring back, whoſe preſence he would enjoy as long as poſſible he can: Yet, if you pleaſe I ſhall acquaint them, for I know they will be extreamly glad to ſee you. No, no, ſaid <hi>Silvia,</hi> I am very glad, that <hi>Adamas</hi> reſolves to ſtay at home this year; for I believe, his preſence will be more neceſſary unto us then we imagine: I will not by any means di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb them; it ſufficeth me to know, that they are well. Then, after ſome other diſcourſe, <hi>Silvia</hi> took her leave, and returned unto <hi>Marcelles,</hi> where <hi>Galathea</hi> was, in a longing expectation for her, deſiring to know what diſcourſe <hi>Leonida</hi> and ſhe had; but, above all, to know what newes of <hi>Celadon,</hi> aſſuring her ſelfe, that <hi>Leonida</hi> could tell. But when ſhe underſtood, that the ſhepheard was not in his Town, and that none knew where he was, ſhe was not a little perplexed, but knew not how to accuſe <hi>Leonida;</hi> for ſhe imagined, that if this ſhepheard had eſcaped by her contrivance, ſhe would never have ſuffered him to go out of the Country. After ſhe had conſidered with her ſelfe, ſhe ſaid, That per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <hi>Leonida</hi> is not acceſſary to <hi>Celadon</hi>'s departure, becauſe he went away out of the Country in that manner. Truly (anſwered <hi>Silvia)</hi> I believe, ſhe never ſo much as thought of any ſuch thing, and I dare anſwer for her, almoſt as much as for my ſelfe. But, if ſhe were not (replyed <hi>Galathea)</hi> why ſhould ſhe not come again, when you ſent unto her from me? Madam, (ſaid <hi>Silvia)</hi> I beſeech you, give me leave to tell you plainly, what anſwer ſhe gave unto me. I do not only give you leave, ſaid the Nymph, but I command you, to tell me. Be pleaſed to know then, Madam, ſaid <hi>Silvia,</hi> that after ſhe had read my Letter, ſhe anſwered: That ſhe knew very well what honour it was, to do you any ſervice, eſpecially to be about your perſon, not being ignorant, that we are all obliged, both by nature and your merits, to devote both our ſervices and lives unto you: But when ſhe conſidered the ſtrange opinions you have entertained of her; and the bad treatment, thoſe opinions have cauſed her to receive from you, ſhe had rather loſe the happineſſe of your preſence, then to be in danger, of farther incurring your disfavour, and become the talk of all the Court: That a Maid has nothing more deer unto her, then her honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and your ſuſpitious of her, have cauſed many diſadvantagious reports to go of her: That ſhe alwaies courts occaſions, to obtain the honour of your favour, by all poſſible ſervices ſhe is able to do; yet, moſt humbly beſeecheth you, not to take it ill, that ſhe does not return again. At this time when I ſpake unto her, ſhe gave me the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; adding many vowes and proteſtations, that what ſhe had told you concerning <hi>Polemas</hi> and <hi>Climanthes,</hi> was true; ſo as I muſt needs ingenuouſly confeſſe, that I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:53526:189"/>
her. Do you think, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> that this can be? Madam, anſwered <hi>Silvia,</hi> I ſee no impoſſibilities in it; for it is moſt certain, <hi>Polemas</hi> does love you, and has ſubtlety e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to invent this trick: Now I am the more apt to believe it, becauſe the very ſame day you found <hi>Celadon, Polemas</hi> was ſeen alone in the ſame place, walking there very long, manifeſting thereby, that he had ſome deſigne in it. How do you know this, ſaid the Nymph? I have learned it, ſaid <hi>Silvia,</hi> from ſeverall perſons, being very inquiſitive to diſcover the truth; ſo as enquiring where <hi>Polemas</hi> was that day, I underſtood at the firſt, that he was not at <hi>Marcelles:</hi> Afterwards, ſearching more narrowly into the truth, I diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he went out of <hi>Fours,</hi> having only one man in his company, whom none did know, of whom he made very extraordinary much of. At laſt, I underſtood from many, that thoſe who ſearched for <hi>Celadon</hi> along the River <hi>Lignon,</hi> found him alone, walking in the ſame place where you found the ſhepheard. Truly, (ſaid <hi>Galathea)</hi> this tale does not a little trouble me; ſo as if it be true, I muſt needs ſay, I have wronged <hi>Leonida,</hi> in treating her as I have; for, till now, I thought this to be a meer trick. Madam, (anſwered <hi>Silvia)</hi> I aſſure you, that <hi>Polemas</hi> was long in that place at that time, as well as many daies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing, without any company: Now, judge you, what could his buſineſſe be there. I muſt now confeſſe, ſaid <hi>Galathea,</hi> that <hi>Polemas</hi> is a knave; and could I diſcover the truth, I would make him repent of his knavery. Mean time, I would have you get <hi>Leonida</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto me, aſſuring her, that ſhe ſhall have my love, ſo ſhe will live with me and you, as ſhe ought to do.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Leonida,</hi> as ſoon as her Companion was gone, returned to <hi>Adamas,</hi> relating part of the newes which ſhe heard, and handſomely concealing what ſhe thought he might take ill. Now, becauſe it was dinner time, the Druide, <hi>Alexis,</hi> and ſhe, retired unto their Lodgings.</p>
               <p>Twelve or fifteen daies being paſt, ſince <hi>Alexis</hi> left her ſad habitation and moſt of the Neighbours had payed all their civill viſits unto <hi>Adamas,</hi> a Servant came and told him, a certain number of ſhepheards came to ſpeak with him, amongſt the reſt, one, whoſe name was <hi>Lycidas.</hi> At the name of <hi>Lycidas, Alexis</hi> ſtarted: Which <hi>Adamas</hi> obſerving, leſt <hi>Paris</hi> ſhould do the ſame, he ſent him to ſee who they were. <hi>Paris</hi> undertook this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion with a very good heart, becauſe he was in fear of his dear <hi>Diana</hi>'s welfare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In the interim, <hi>Adamas</hi> looked upon <hi>Alexis,</hi> ſaying: I am afraid Daughter, leſt your hatred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Brother ſhould diſcover, what we deſire ſo much to conceal. It is impoſſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed ſhe, but I ſhould be ſurpriſed at this unexpected newes; therefore, if you pleaſe, I will withdraw into the next Chamber, till theſe ſhepheards be gone. No, ſaid <hi>Adamas,</hi> for doubtleſſe they come hither to ſee you: Beſides, it is not good to put <hi>Paris</hi> himſelfe in any doubt. <hi>Alexis</hi> did not reply, becauſe ſhe heard the voice of <hi>Lycidas</hi> at the ſtairs foot. Preſently after, all the Company came into the Hall, where the Druide received them with extraordinary demonſtrations of love. The moſt eminent amongſt them was <hi>Diamis, Diana</hi>'s Uncle; <hi>Phoceon,</hi> Uncle to <hi>Aſtrea; Lycidas, Silvander, Coridus, Amidor:</hi> And though <hi>Tircis</hi> and <hi>Hylas</hi> were not of that Country; yet, having ſojourned foure or five months in their Towne, they came with them for loves-ſake, and good company. <hi>Phoceon,</hi> the mouth of all the reſt, preſented their good affections to the Druide, together with their cordiall deſires to do him ſervice: Afterwards told him, that two occaſions had principally invited them thither: The one, to congratulate with him in his joyes, of ſeeing his Daughter <hi>Alexis:</hi> The other, to acquaint him, that it had pleaſed the great <hi>Tauta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> to ſend ſome <hi>Miſleto</hi> into the Grove belonging to their Town; therefore they came to beſeech him, he would be pleaſed, according to their cuſtome, to take ſo much paines, as to come and make a ſacrifice of thanks. Then the Prieſt addreſſed himſelfe: Sir, ſaid he, what I ſhall relate unto you, is very ſtrange: As I was ſearching out <hi>Miſleto</hi> for the new year, I found things, that are no leſſe then wonders, in the ſacred Grove of <hi>Heſius, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramis, Belinus,</hi> our great god <hi>Theutates.</hi> Firſt a Temple of Hazells and young Oakes, ſo twiſted and plaited to a great Oake in the mideſt, as there is an arched Vault, ſo ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, as to contain many people: In the midſt, is a bank of Graſſe, in form of an Altar, upon which ſtands a Picture, repreſenting reciprocall Amity, together with the twelve Statutes of the Lawes of Love. Within this, we found another Temple, dedicated unto the goddeſſe <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> Oh Sir! I cannot chuſe but admire the myſtery. There are in this, two Altars, the chiefe of which is Triangular, under the moſt wonderfull Oake that ever was; for, having but one ſtock, it divides it ſelfe into three branches, then rejoynes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into one bark again at the top, in ſuch an admirable manner, as that they make
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:53526:190"/>
but one Tree, and ſpreads it ſelfe above all the Trees in the Grove. There we found the falubrious <hi>Miſleto,</hi> ſo freſh, and well growne, as by the report of all the Prieſts, none in all the Country is comparable unto it. There the ſacred name of the great <hi>Tautates</hi> is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven, with the names of <hi>Heſius, Tharamis,</hi> and <hi>Belinus,</hi> upon the three branches, which doth evidence unto us, that god loves the place, and would be there adored.</p>
               <p>Thus the Prieſt related theſe things unto the Druide, who knew them better then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, being the Inventor of them. It was a cuſtome amongſt the <hi>Gaules,</hi> that a Month be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſixteenth of <hi>July,</hi> they ſearched throughout all the Country for an Oake that had the fineſt <hi>Miſleto;</hi> then to make a report of it unto the grand Druide, to the end it might be ceremoniouſly gathered: To that end, all the Prieſts aſſembled, ſeeking for it in all the groves; then when they found it, they gave it a mark. Now thinking it to be a ſigne of gods love, that it ſhould be found in the Grove next their own Town, the People of it were wont to offer a particular ſacrifice of thanks, where the grand Druide uſed to officiate, if he was pleaſed to favour them ſo much. Now, foraſmuch as <hi>Adamas</hi> did very much love theſe men, beſides his deſigne upon <hi>Alexis,</hi> upon whoſe contentment, he thought, his own depended, according to the Oracle; therefore he promiſed to go with them, whenſoever the Prieſt would advertiſe him. The Shepheards returned their thanks in the beſt expreſſions that poſſibly they could. Although (ſaid <hi>Adamas,</hi> and ſmiled) I have ſome reaſon to be ſorry, that the ſhepheardeſſes of your Town are the only neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who have not favoured me with a viſit, in congratulation of my Daughters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; yet, I muſt needs let them know, that I do eſteem them above any in the Country. <hi>Paris</hi> deſiring to excuſe his Miſtreſſe with the reſt, did humbly make addreſſe unto him: Father (anſwered he) I beſeech you excuſe them, for I have heard them reſolve, to come and ſee my Siſter; but <hi>Aſtrea</hi> being ſo ſick, as forced to keep her bed, hath a little deferred it, becauſe they deſire to have her company. Since it is ſo, ſaid <hi>Adamas,</hi> I am ſatisfied with the excuſe; otherwiſe, I ſhould take it a little unkindly. <hi>Phoceon</hi> then addreſſing himſelfe: It is moſt true ſaid he, that my Niece hath of late been very ſickly; ſo as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her beſt Phyſick will be to marry. You may do very well (ſaid <hi>Adamas)</hi> to let it be your indulgent care, for ſhe is now of a fit age for it.</p>
               <p>Whilſt <hi>Adamas</hi> was thus talking with theſe ſhepheards, <hi>Leonida</hi> and <hi>Alexis</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained others. But as ſoon as <hi>Lycidas</hi> fixed his eye upon his Brother, it was long before he could draw it off; for, he thought he ſaw the very face of <hi>Celadon:</hi> then conſidering it a little more preciſely, he admired, that two perſons ſhould reſemble one another ſo much; yet, the ſetled opinion of his death, the authority of the Druide, who ſaid, ſhe was his Daughter; the habit of a Nymph, together with a little alteration in the face of <hi>Alexis,</hi> did make <hi>Lycidas</hi> give the lie unto his own eyes. After a little longer looking upon her, he could not chuſe but ſay thus: Madam, If I did as much reſemble him, whom you love moſt, as you do the perſon whom I love and honour moſt, I ſhould hope ere long to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate my ſelfe into your favour. Kinde Shepheard, (anſwered <hi>Alexis)</hi> I am glad I have any reſemblance of the perſon whom you love; for, knowing from my Father how he eſteemes you, I ſhall take any occaſion to continue that amity you bear unto him. The obligations we do owe unto the Father, (anſwered <hi>Lycidas)</hi> together with the merits of the Daughter, commands us to do you all ſervice; but me above all others, who does ſee him live again in your face, whoſe life was deerer to me then my own. Theſe were the firſt complements which paſſed between the two Brothers.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Leonida</hi> conſtrained her ſelfe as much as poſſibly ſhe could, yet ſhe could not chuſe but ſmile, to ſee how <hi>Lycidas</hi> was deceived; but fearing, leſt <hi>Alexis</hi> ſhould not at the firſt, act a womans part very well, ſhe interpoſed, ſeeming to be very zealous in enquiring, how all the ſhepheardeſſes her friends did: Therefore, good <hi>Lycidas,</hi> (ſaid ſhe) leave off your fine complements, and tell me, how all my dear friends do. Some (anſwered <hi>Lycidas)</hi> are merry, others ſad, and ſome neither merry nor ſad, but do glide away time ſmoothly, without extreams Who is it, (ſaid <hi>Leonida)</hi> that is ſo inſenſible either of mirth or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, as ſhe reſents neither? It is the ſhepheardeſſe <hi>Diana,</hi> anſwered <hi>Lycidas;</hi> for, ſhe loving none, is neither merry nor ſad ſince if theſe do not proceed from love, they do not deſerve the name. I do believe, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> that you do think as you ſpeak; but every one is not of your opinion. Thoſe that think otherwiſe (ſaid he) are like unto thoſe Antients, who thought Water and Akehornes to be the fineſt food, when they knew not what Wine and Wheat was; but now, we think that to be food only for Beaſts: So thoſe who have tryed the ſweets and bitters of Love, will confeſſe, that all others are nothing in compariſon. Do
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:53526:190"/>
you think (ſaid <hi>Leonida)</hi> that <hi>Diana</hi> never did love any, nor does love any yet? For what is paſt (ſaid <hi>Lycidas)</hi> I will not anſwere; but for the preſent, I beleeve ſhe lets all matters of love alone; you tell me ill newes for <hi>Paris</hi> (replyed <hi>Leonida).</hi> This, ſaid the ſhepheard is the folly of our Towne, for I verily beleeve that <hi>Diana</hi> is not ſenſible of the honour which <hi>Paris</hi> doth her: yet if I be deceived, I am not the firſt that is miſtaken in Women Well: ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> let us leave <hi>Diana</hi> for this time, and tell me who is ſhe that is the ſad one? It is <hi>Aſtrea</hi> (anſwered <hi>Lycidas)</hi> for <hi>Phoceon</hi> a covetous Uncle, who, as moſt old men do, thinkes there is no happineſſe but in marrying his Neece richly, will needs beſtow her upon a <hi>Boyen</hi> ſhepheard called <hi>Calydon,</hi> whom ſhe never ſaw above one minute at the moſt, and whom ſhe does not love, yet for my part I beleeve the old fellow will bring the match about.</p>
               <p>Is not this <hi>Calydon,</hi> (ſaid the Nymph) Nephew unto <hi>Tamares?</hi> The very ſame (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he). But (replyed <hi>Leonida)</hi> has he forgot his love unto <hi>Celidea?</hi> Oh Madam, (ſaid he) <hi>Celidea</hi> is not the ſame ſhe was: the accident of her loſſe was indeed very ſtrange. Why, ſaid the Nymph, is <hi>Celidea</hi> loſt? ſhe may be termed ſo (anſwered he) and the heart of <hi>Tamire</hi> is now wholly upon marrying <hi>Calydon.</hi> Though <hi>Alexis</hi> was talking with <hi>Corilas, Hylas,</hi> and <hi>Amidor,</hi> yet ſhe lent an eare unto <hi>Lycidas,</hi> whoſe words went ſo to her heart, that every one tooke notice of her, becauſe at the firſt ſhe bluſhed, then preſently after grew as pale as aſhes: This cauſed <hi>Leonida</hi> to aske her how ſhe did, and to ſay that this was a relique of her old diſeaſe, therefore deſired her to ſit downe. <hi>Hylas</hi> who from the firſt ſight of her had a good mind to her, ſo as <hi>Phillis</hi> was almoſt quite out, and this in his heart, he took her by the arme and made her ſit downe as it were by force; then ſitting by her, his eyes were never off her face. In the meane time <hi>Leonida</hi> and <hi>Lycidas</hi> went unto the window, there continued on their diſcourſe: but <hi>Lycidas</hi> ſtill eying <hi>Alexis,</hi> he firſt ſaid; I cannot chuſe but looke upon the faire Daughter of <hi>Adamas;</hi> for ſhe has ſuch a reſemblance of my poore Brother, both in her features and Aire, as I can finde no difference betweene them, but in habit. Is it long (ſaid <hi>Leonida)</hi> ſince he dyed? It is (anſwered he) about four monthes ſince. I have heard ſo many good reports of him (ſaid <hi>Leonida)</hi> that I am ſorry I never ſaw him. As for his Interiour parts, I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe him unto you (ſaid <hi>Lycidas).</hi> But as for his face and actions, looke upon <hi>Alexis</hi> who is the juſt picture of him: The very ſame eyes, the ſame mouth, the ſame ſymmetrie of every part. <hi>Alexis</hi> all this while did ſuffer all that <hi>Hylas</hi> ſaid, but it was with much adoe: Oh heavens? (ſaid <hi>Lycidas)</hi> the very ſame ſmile! the ſame turne of his head! Was there ever ſuch a reſemblance as this? <hi>Leonida</hi> fearing that his conſideration of her reſemblance unto <hi>Celadon,</hi> might diſcover that ſhe was <hi>Celadon</hi> indeed, ſhe ſaid thus unto him. But <hi>Lycidas</hi> to returne unto our former diſcourſe; when <hi>Paris</hi> erected his Tombe I heard that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> did infinitly love him, and could not chuſe but breake out into many expreſſions of it: I would it had pleaſed the gods (anſwered <hi>Lycidas</hi> with a deep ſigh) that ſhe had never loved him, for then my brother had bin now alive. Why, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> do you accuſe her for his death? I have heard that ſhe has ſo grieved his loſſe, as ſhe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath been in danger. The ſtory (ſaid <hi>Lycidas</hi> very faintly) would be too long and tedious to relate now; but if ſhe be unhappy in marrying <hi>Calydon,</hi> who loves her not, It is the juſt revenge of love upon her for the death of <hi>Celadon</hi> who adored her, of which ſhe is too guilty: Is it long ſince <hi>Celadon</hi> was loſt (ſaid <hi>Leonida).</hi> It is about twelve or fifeene dayes ſince, (anſwered he). Then (ſaid the Nymph) it was preſently after ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived our judgement: Ten or twelve dayes after, ſaid the ſhepheard, I aſſure you all that knew her, laments her loſſe, For my part, ſaid the Nymph, I never heard of it untill now, yet beleeve me I do deeply reſent it: but pray <hi>Lycidas</hi> tell me, how it came to paſſe.</p>

In the mean time <hi>Thamires</hi> acquainting <hi>Cleontine</hi> with his deſigne and eſpecially <hi>Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas</hi> Mother, within a fortnight all things were in that forwardneſſe, as there wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to conſummate the marriage but going to bed together.

                  <hi>Thamires</hi> hearing this, did exceedingly pitty him, and more, when after theſe words he ſaw him lift up his hands and eyes, and ſo ſwel'd with teares, that he was not able to ſpeak, he withdrew gently to tell <hi>Celidea</hi> in what condition ſhe found him, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her to give him ſome conſolation. The ſhepheardeſſe was very willing to obey <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires,</hi> nor was ſhe deſirous to loſe <hi>Calidons</hi> favour, ſince ſhe was to live with his Unckle, therefore ſhe went unto him, whom finding in that condition, How now ſhepheard, ſaid ſhe unto him, what all alone when we are in dancing? Ah ſhepheardeſſe, anſwered he, you may well allow me that liberty, ſince all your mirth is at my coſt; but I wiſh it were without offence to god or you, that I might end my ſad dayes, before this night came to put me out of all hopes of any contentment. What do you meane? (ſaid the ſhephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe) my meaning is, replyed he, that did I not offend the great <hi>Tautates</hi> in putting my ſelfe to death, and you, in making you to loſe a moſt faithfull ſervant, this very hand ſhould diſpatch my life, before that night come in which I ſhall ſee <hi>Thamires</hi> enjoy her whom my affection onely can merit. <hi>Celidea</hi> ſeeming to take no notice of any ſuch things; I thought ſaid ſhe, that you had forgotten all thoſe follies, and I do wonder they ſhould be ſtill in your memorie. How? (replyed <hi>Calidon</hi> with a deep ſigh) can <hi>Calidon</hi> ever for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get <hi>Celidea?</hi> are you not afraid <hi>Thamires</hi> will puniſh you for an offence ſo great againſt my love? Take heed your offence be not greater (anſwered ſhe) when you call to minde the promiſe made unto <hi>Leonida</hi> to obſerve the ſentence ſhe ſhould pronounce: have you ſo ſoone forgot it? or do you think the gods ever will? How can you ever hope that the <hi>Miſleto</hi> of the new yeare, ſhould ever be ſalubrious unto you, ſince you ſwore by it to obey your doome? Ah ſhepheardeſſe (replyed <hi>Celadon)</hi> Do not think I have forgot the unjuſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that pittileſſe Nymph (pardon me Madam for repeating his words) The memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it is too ſadly freſh, to be ſo ſoone forgotten; nor do not thinke I am of opinion that the gods forget my oath; no nor that I care whether the <hi>Miſleto</hi> of the new yeare, be Salubrious or no, ſince in loving you, there is nothing in this world that I do care for. Yet, Do you not ſtand in feare (ſaid ſhe) of the juſtice of the gods after your death? The gods, ſaid ſhe, can inflict no more paine then I ſuffer in my life: For there are not more cruell torments then thoſe I endure. Yet not withſtanding do not thinke me ſo ill an obſerver of what I have promiſed: you may remember my vow was, to obſerve the Nymphs judgement, as long as I lived: well (ſaid ſhe) do you not diſobey it by theſe expreſſions unto me? No, anſwered he, for do you not perceive that I have been dying
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:53526:191"/>
ever ſince that doome was pronounced? For life is not to live, but to live well. Now ever ſince that fatall moment, I have beene ſo far from living well, as I have not onely loſt my happyneſſe, but all my hopes of it. If you call languiſhing a life, I ſay againe, let the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Miſleto</hi> be never Salubrious unto me. When no hopes are left, let life go whither it will, for nothing can do me good ſince you are gone. If the gods will but heare the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of a moſt deſolate man, I ſhall ſoone die. What advantage can you hope for (ſaid ſhe) in dying? From it (ſaid he) I expect all my felicity: for none is to be hop't for here, ſince I cannot love you unleſſe I offend the gods, or you whom I do feare. But, moſt cruell ſhepheardeſſe, what was your deſigne in coming unto me? Was it to tryumph once more over poore <hi>Calidon?</hi> or are you like thoſe merry minded people, who when they have killed a poore miſerable Innocent that never did them harm, they come to ſee how great the wounds are which they gave him. That, ſad ſhepheard, ſaid ſhe, was not the cauſe which invited me hither: but it was to trye if I could divert you from your ſad thoughts: ſo as if I could without offence to the will of the gods, I would give you ſome conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. How? (ſaid he preſently) does it not ſuffice you, that I dy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> by the cruell hand of fate and by the injuſtice of men, which has taken from me all that I can call life, but you muſt alſo add a vaine compaſſion, which you ſeeme to have of me, onely to make me die with more griefe? Would you have me think you pitty me? Nay nay, never talke to me of any pitty, or health, or remedy, or any hope, for I am as incapable of any good, as you are of will to do it.</p>
               <p>It was now late; ſo as the Ball being ended, <hi>Celidea</hi> according to Nuptiall cuſtomes was conducted to bed, and afterwards <hi>Thamires</hi> unto her; <hi>Calidon</hi> he went both out of the chamber and the houſe; and by fortune did lye downe under ſome great Elmes by the way ſide neere unto the houſe. Where after he had a while conſidered the happineſſe of <hi>Thamires,</hi> and then his owne ſad fate, his heart ſo failed him, as he fell into a ſwound, and continued in it, till <hi>Cleontine</hi> and her company coming out of the houſe, found him lying all along as if he were aſleep. But offering to wake him, and ſeeing he did not ſtirre, <hi>Cleontine</hi> herſelfe tooke his hand; which finding to be very cold, becauſe all the naturall heat of the outward parts was retired to the heart, ſhe cryed out, Oh, <hi>Calidon</hi> is dead. Many that heard her voyce did run unto her: So as when they ſaw him in that condition, the cry was ſo loud as it cauſed all the neighborhood to reſort thither: many ran into the houſe ſtill, crying out aloud <hi>Calidon</hi> was dead, <hi>Calidon</hi> was dead: In ſo much as <hi>Thamires</hi> heard the noiſe; and hearing nothing named but <hi>Calidon</hi> and Death, he doubted ſome diſaſtrous accident: Therefore leaping out of bed, he run to the dore to call ſome of the houſe, and at laſt was told that <hi>Calidon</hi> was dead. <hi>Thamires</hi> loved him as dearely as if he had been his owne Sonne: So as at this ſad newes he fell down the ſtaires to the bottom: his ſervants tooke him him up, and carryed him to his bed: his pulſe failed and he by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees grew ſo cold, as if he had not been well looked unto he had been in as bad a condition as <hi>Calidon:</hi> but the application of good remedies together with <hi>Celidea's</hi> care, did do him much good. Whoſoever had ſeen this faire and young Bride thus all undreſt waſhing the face of her brid-groome with her teares, and had not been mooved unto pitty, doubtleſſe his heart was made of Marble. The looſeneſſe of her garments together with the negligent care of herſelfe, added much unto her beauty: She having recovered him unto his ſenſes did bathe her kiſſes in a flood of teares. But the poor ſhepheard being unſenſible of any paſſion, but ſorrow of his friends loſſe, did faintly receive her kiſſes, and puſhed her away with his hand, as if he did not care for them: he would hardly look upon her, onely ſtill asked what newes of <hi>Calidon:</hi> but hearing none that was good, I ſee, ſaid he, that as he dyed for the contentment which I have, ſo I muſt dye for the griefe which he had. Then riſing up in a fury, halfe naked, he run to the place where poore <hi>Calidon</hi> lay along as if he were abſolut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dead. Every one gave place unto him, as well out of reſpect, as compaſſion at his greife which doubtleſſe was very great, ſince he had left <hi>Celedea,</hi> and diſdained that happineſſe which he had ſo long and ſo zealouſly deſired. When he ſaw <hi>Calidon,</hi> thinking him to be dead, he fell upon him but ſo unfortunately, as he hit his forehead againſt a ſharp ſtone, on which they had laid the head of <hi>Calidon;</hi> his face was immediately all blood and there he remained in a ſwound. Thoſe that were about them, did heare the blow which <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires</hi> had, and had an opinion, that he was hurt. But did not think he was hurt ſo much as he was. Had they not obſerved him ſo long without either motion or ſpeech, they had taken notice of it too late. Now, cryes began againe a freſh, and the clamours of all thoſe who beheld this lamentable ſpectacle, grew very loud. Judge what horror this was
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:53526:192"/>
unto <hi>Colidea,</hi> when ſhe ſaw her Husband and his Nephew lie together like dead men. By fortune, as they carried <hi>Calidon</hi> in a chair into his Chamber, he revived. Then ſeeing ſo many people about him, and all ſmeered with the blood of <hi>Thamires</hi> he knew not what to think, but that he was in a dream. When he ſaw them carrying his Uncle, who was yet ſenſleſſe, with a great wound in his head, he imagined, that ſome body had wounded him; therefore tranſported with rage, he roſe up and asked, who was the murderer: He took up a ſtone, and held up his arme, as ready to throw it at him, who had done the the homicide: But, when he heard how it was; How, ſaid he, am I my ſelfe the murderer? Is not revenge as well due to me as to another; nay, more, ſince there was more obligations upon me. Upon this, he lifted up his arme, intending to knock himſelfe in the head with the ſtone; but he was prevented by friends, who held his arme, took away the ſtone, and never let him go, till he was better ſetled in his reaſon.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Thamires,</hi> by reaſon of the loud clamours, and the good remedies which were applyed unto him, he was no ſooner dreſſed and put into bed, but he came out of his ſwound: When his eyes were open, and he could ſpeak, the firſt word was, the name of <hi>Calidon,</hi> asking where his body was. <hi>Calidon</hi> (anſwered one) is much better then you are. How, ſaid he, is not <hi>Calidon</hi> dead? Oh my friends, I pray do not mock me. He is alive, ſaid another; and if you will not fall into a ſwound again when you ſee him, we will bring him hither very well recovered. Oh god! ſaid <hi>Thamires,</hi> if this be ſo, uſe all your beſt remedies to cure me alſo. Upon this, he offered to riſe, but the Chirurgions would not ſuffer him. Now becauſe <hi>Calidon</hi> was as impatient to ſee <hi>Thamires,</hi> it was thought requiſite for the ſetlement of their ſpirits, to let them ſee each other, though they feared, it would cauſe the wound of <hi>Thamires</hi> to bleed afreſh; but conceiving, this inconveniency would be leſſe, then that which might ariſe by reſtraining them, they brought <hi>Calidon</hi> to the Chamber, who ſeeing <hi>Thamires</hi> in that condition, and having heard all the paſſages, he kneeled down before him, and asked him pardon, for the griefe and pain which he had put him unto: Excuſe, good Father, ſaid he unto him, the little power that I had to command my ſelfe; I come to aske you pardon upon my knees, and beſeech you to believe, that I will never reſt, till I have given ſatisfaction for my fault. Son, (ſaid <hi>Thamires)</hi> riſe up, and let me embrace thee Had I thought, that <hi>Celidea</hi> would have ever been thine, ſhe ſhould never have been mine: My greateſt griefe is now, that heretofore there was one impediment unto thy deſires, and now there is two: The firſt is, her will, which was ever ſo averſe unto thee, that ſhe would never conſent to be thine: The other is, the Marriage of her and me. Could her will change as well, as I could remedy the laſt of theſe impediments, believe it, <hi>Calidon,</hi> my death ſhould be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to me, ſo I could thereby render thee contentment. <hi>Calidon</hi> would have anſwered, but he could not, becauſe <hi>Thamires</hi> at the ſame time, addreſſed his ſpeech unto <hi>Celidea;</hi> And you; <hi>Celidea,</hi> ſaid he, who ſees how extreamly <hi>Calidon</hi> does love you; is it poſſible, you ſhould not change your will, and affect him? Cannot his affection, his merits, and my prayers, obtain ſo much from you? Was <hi>Celidea</hi> born to kill both <hi>Calidon</hi> and <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires,</hi> both with love and ſorrow? <hi>Celidea,</hi> all in tears, would have anſwered, but <hi>Calidon</hi> prevented her: Father, ſaid he, the ordinance of heaven, and the will of this fair One, muſt be as it is; <hi>Tautates</hi> knowes what is fit, better then we our ſelves: There is no reaſon, that two perſons, who merit all manner of good fortune, as <hi>Thamires</hi> and <hi>Celidea</hi> do, ſhould change their fortune for my moſt miſerable ſake. For my part, I do vow, and cal heaven and earth to witneſs, that I wil never whilſt I breathe contradict the judgment, which the heavens have given by the mouth of the Nymph. What then, ſaid <hi>Thamires,</hi> do all theſe tears, theſe complaints, and theſe ſwoonings ſignifie? They are teſtimonies, anſwered <hi>Calidon,</hi> that I am but a man. As good Chirurgions will not take their hand from the wound, though the Patient complain and cry; ſo you ought not to ceaſe from that good work, which it hath pleaſed <hi>Tautates</hi> to ordain. I deſire no other favour, but leave to complain, and to cry out when the pain torments me. Nay, nay, (ſaid <hi>Celidea,</hi> in a very violent and paſſionate manner) let neither of you put your ſelves unto that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; the great god <hi>Tharamis,</hi> will ſecretly inſpire me with a means, how to ſet both your hearts at reſt: It is not reaſonable, that all your prayers and demonſtrations, ſhould any longer be without producing ſome effects; but withall, the will of <hi>Tautates</hi> muſt be done, nor muſt the good opinion I had of you from my very cradle, ſhew out no ſparks of will towards you. And you, <hi>Calidon,</hi> it is not fit you ſhould conſume away your life in this manner: No, no, live both of you contentedly; give me only leave to think upon
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:53526:192"/>
it foure or five daies, and you ſhall ſee, how heaven will direct me unto means, to eaſe you both of your ſorrowes. Upon this, ſhe entreated <hi>Thamires,</hi> he would be pleaſed to excuſe her from lying with him for foure or five nights, to the end, ſhe might the better contrive the way, how to accompliſh her deſigne. <hi>Thamires,</hi> who begun to be ſenſible of the ſmart which his wounds cauſed, who would have conſented unto his own death; to ſave the life of <hi>Calidon,</hi> he did freely grant her requeſt. Then after ſome other diſcourſe upon this ſubject, the Chirurgions ſeeing, that the hopes which <hi>Celidea</hi> had put them into, would conduce unto their reſt, and conſequently unto their recovery, they adviſed all the company to withdraw. <hi>Calidon</hi> cauſed a bed to be brought into the Chamber of <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires,</hi> becauſe he would not leave him. On the other ſide, <hi>Thamires</hi> was ſo pleaſed with the expreſſions of his Nephew's affection to him, as he much deſired to have him alwaies with him.
<hi>Celidea</hi> was the moſt perplexed of any, for ſhe would not impart her deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination unto any one, leſt ſhe ſhould be prevented in her deſigne, though ſhe did not yet know how to effect it: Her deſigne was much different from the humours of all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whatſoever; for knowing, that it was the beauty of her face, which was the cauſe of the paſſionate love, both in <hi>Thamires</hi> and his Nephew; alſo conſidering, that it only was the cauſe of the divorce betwixt them, ſhe reſolved to make it ſo ugly for the future, as that they ſhould hereafter grow as cold at her deformity, as heretofore they were enflamed at her beauty; hoping by this means, to bring <hi>Calidon</hi> to his ſenſes again and to give ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction unto the world, that ſhe never conſented unto theſe follies. After ſhe had long thought upon the way, and not liking the way of a knife, by reaſon of the blood and cruelty, unto which her courage could not conſent; at laſt ſhe addreſſed her ſelfe unto her Nurſes Mother, whom taking aſide, ſhe let her underſtand, that ſhe had a moſt deadly hatred unto a ſhepheardeſſe her neighbour, who had infinitely wronged her; that ſhe was fully reſolved upon revenge; that her hatred went not ſo far as death, but only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a revenge upon her face, as upon the thing which ſhe moſt valued. In order to this, ſhe deſired her, to acquaint her with ſome Plant or other Receipt, which would ſo mar the face of this Maid, as it ſhould never recover its beauty again. The good woman, who loved <hi>Celidea</hi> very well, did very diſcreetly anſwer: That any ſuch cruell deſires of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge was unhandſome, and did not become her: That if the other had wronged her, the beſt way was, to refer revenge unto <hi>Heſius,</hi> who had power to do it: That if ſhe did her ſelfe take revenge, it was to be feared, that ſhe unto whom it was done, would pay her back double in her owne coyne. To be briefe, ſhe uſed all poſſible arguments and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to divert her from this deſigne. But <hi>Celidea,</hi> whoſe deſigne was different from what ſhe made appear, did ſtill reſolutely perſiſt in her requeſt, telling the woman, that ſhe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom ſhe would be revenged, was not a perſon that could revenge again; beſides, it ſhould be carried ſo ſecretly, as ſhe ſhould never know from whence it proceeded; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conjured her in all love, to ſatisfie her requeſt; proteſting that if ſhe did not, ſhe would cauſe her to attempt ſomething that was much worſe. The good woman anſwered, that ſhe ſhould be very ſorry, to be a cauſe of any worſe accident, therefore within two or three daies ſhe would give her an anſwer. Do not fail me then, ſaid <hi>Celidea;</hi> for if you do, you will be the cauſe of a far greater miſchiefe. The terme being expired which this good woman took, only to paſſe on time, ſhe deſired a longer. But <hi>Celidea,</hi> who knew that this was only delay, yet ſhe ſeemed to believe her, whilſt in the interim, ſhe would take the beſt way ſhe could to accompliſh her deſigne; ſetting a face of beliefe in the good old woman upon it, leſt ſhe ſhould diſcover her intention unto <hi>Cleontine. Celidea</hi> then ſeeking out for any way to disſigure her ſelfe, as ill luck was, ſhe came in the morning unto <hi>Cleontine</hi>'s Chamber, when ſhe was in bed; and becauſe <hi>Cleontine</hi> was accuſtomed to wear a pointed Diamond upon her finger, as a token, that ſhe was dedicated unto <hi>Theu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates,</hi> as you know, Madam, it is the cuſtome of all our Druides, ſhe uſed every night, when ſhe went into bed, to put it off, and to take it again in the morning. So it hapned, that <hi>Celidea</hi> taking up this Ring, ſhe put it upon her finger, and from one to another, trying which it would beſt fit, perhaps not thinking what ſhe did; which <hi>Cleontine</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Daughter, ſaid ſhe, are you willing to wear that Ring, upon the ſame conditions that I do? If I were able, anſwered <hi>Celidea,</hi> there is nothing in the world I ſhould more deſire. How then can you think, ſaid <hi>Cleontine,</hi> to ſatisfie both <hi>Thamires</hi> and <hi>Calidon,</hi> as you have promiſed? That anſwered ſhe, would be the beſt remedy of all others; for, they are ſo religiouſly diſpoſed, as if I were once dedicated unto <hi>Theutates,</hi> neither of them would offer to have me out again. Love, ſaid <hi>Cleontine,</hi> is above either duty of
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:53526:193"/>
religion: But pray, Daughter, tell me, which way do you think to give them both ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; for truly, I cannot underſtand, which way you can do it? For in the firſt place, you are Wife unto <hi>Thamires;</hi> therefore if you would, you cannot dedicate your ſelfe unto <hi>Theutates,</hi> without his leave: But, ſuppoſe you were a Druide, do you think that would content them both? No ſurely, but rather diſcontent them both, ſince, then, both are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of you. Mother, (anſwered <hi>Celidea)</hi> the great gods will doubtleſſe inſpire me with ſome way or other, and by their aide, I do not doubt but I ſhall effect it; for in them I put my whole truſt. Daughter, (ſaid <hi>Cleontine)</hi> the gods do never fail thoſe that truſt in them, and therefore ſince you make them your confidence, I ſhall believe you may bring it to paſſe. <hi>Cleontine</hi> would have continued on her diſcourſe; but <hi>Celidea</hi> by accident, did give her hand ſuch a ſcratch with the Diamond, that ſhe cryed out; at which <hi>Cleontine</hi> ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: What have you done, ſaid ſhe, have you cut your ſelfe with the Diamond? A ſmall ſcratch, anſwered <hi>Celidea,</hi> though the pain of it did make me cry out. You think it ſmall, ſaid <hi>Cleontine,</hi> but you are deceived; for the mark will never out, and the cut is very hard to be healed. Then looking into her hand, and ſeeing it much ſcratched: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, <hi>Celidea,</hi> ſaid ſhe, you have a mark as long as you live, and had it been upon your face, it had been quite ſpoiled. How, ſaid <hi>Celidea,</hi> is a Diamond ſo venomous? The mark of it, ſaid <hi>Cleontine,</hi> will never out; and that's the reaſon, why I leave it off every night, when I go to bed. Oh! how glad was this young ſhepheardeſſe, when ſhe heard of this ſecret? ſhe thought that the gods had purpoſely taught it her, to accompliſh her deſigne. I ſhall now acquaint you Madam, with the ſtrange reſolution of this young woman. It was already five or ſix daies ſince <hi>Thamires</hi> received his hurt; and his wound not being dangerous, he recovered ſo faſt, that he began to go out of his Chamber. <hi>Calidon</hi> and <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires</hi> both did ſummon <hi>Celidea</hi> to the performance of her promiſe. She, with a ſmiling brow, told them, That tomorrow ſhe would give them both content. At night, when her Aunt was in bed ſhe ſtole her Ring; and when ſhe came into her Chamber, ſhe cauſed all to go to bed, and ſhut the dore: Then ſhe ſet her ſelfe down by a Table, upon which ſtood a Glaſſe, in which, againſt all Feſtivalls, ſhe was wont to dreſſe her ſelfe: As ſoon as ever ſhe ſaw her fair face in it; Oh Mirrour (ſaid ſhe) with whom I was wont to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with ſo much care and circumſpection, how to adorn this face? How different is the occaſion now, that makes me take thy counſell? I was wont by thy advice, to make my ſelfe more fair; but now I come to know, how I ſhall blaſt this beauty, which was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo deer unto me. Upon this, opening the Glaſſe, and ſeeing her face all ſwell'd with tears: Oh eyes! ſaid ſhe, you were not human, did you not lament the loſſe of that beauty, which heretofore did ſwell you with ſo much delight. Afterwards being ſilent a while, and conſidering particularly her beauty, her grace, the juſt proportion of her parts, the lively and ſweet luſtre of her eyes, the freſhneſſe of her roſie complexion, the compoſure of her mouth, and briefly, all the pleaſing parts of her face: I know very well, ſaid ſhe, Oh my moſt precious and dearly loved treaſures, how valuable you are; but alas, what are you worth unto me, if I cannot enjoy any contentment in preſerving you? I have formerly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed this beauty as my higheſt and richeſt jewell, I know how much I have been cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for your ſake; but when I ſhall charge you before the Throne of Reaſon, to have been the cauſe of all the torments I have endured: when I blame you, for the diſſention that is betwixt the Uncle and the Nephew; nay, when I charge you, as guilty of their blood and ruine; nay more, perhaps of their death, what can you ſay in your own defence? what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons can you alledge, why I ſhould ſtill retain and preſerve you? Perhaps you will ſay, that it is a very ſweet thing to be fair; but tell me, how bitter are thoſe effects, which that ſweet doth produce, and how I ſhould avoid them, by preſerving you? Perhaps you will reply, that love is the effect and conſequent of beauty, and nothing in the world is more pleaſing, then to be loved and carraſſed. Perhaps again you will ſay, that whilſt I am fair, every one will adore me, and when I am foul, every one will diſdain me. But for all that, let me tell thee by way of anſwer, that in doing ſo ſtrange an act, every one will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire me, and be apt to believe, that there is ſome hidden perfection in me, which does tranſcend this outward beauty. Alſo in defacing thy luſter, I ſhall but anticipate time of a few minutes: For, this beauty which we ſo much prize, for all our carefull preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will quickly fade, a few years more will raviſh it from me: Is it not therefore better to part from it voluntarily, having ſo good an occaſion, and to ſacrifice it unto the tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Calidon,</hi> who hath born me ſo much affection? What will the worſt conſequence be of it? Why, when I am ugly, fewer perſons will love me; I cannot hope to finde any
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:53526:193"/>
affection, but from <hi>Thamires:</hi> Now if the affection of <hi>Thamires</hi> be grounded only upon my beauty, it will quickly fall off when my beauty decayes; but, if he have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> any other baſis for his love, certainly he will love me the more, becauſe I have made my ſelfe wholly his, ſince none elſe will yet look upon me. To be briefe, it is this beauty, which hath cauſed all the miſeries, both of <hi>Calidon, Thamires,</hi> and my ſelfe. I will eaſe them therefore and my ſelfe too, by parting from that, which would of it ſelfe ere long part from me: I will ſet them both at liberty, and my ſelfe at reſt. Now, Madam, I ſhall relate unto you a moſt ſtrange and generous act: <hi>Celidea,</hi> as ſoon as ſhe had ſaid ſo, took the Diamond, and with a reſolute hand, did cut the skin of her fair face in ſeverall places; though the pain of it was extream, yet ſhe cut on, ſtill gnaſhing her teeth, till ſhe had made five or ſix long and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> gaſhes in her cheeks and forehead, ſo as all her beauty was quite defaced. Imagine, Madam, how ſadly ſhe muſt needs reſent this act; but ſhe did not at all ſeem to be ſorry for it, only put a cloth about her head, put out the Candle, went into her Aunts Chamber, laid the Ring in its place, and went to bed; you may eaſily imagine, ſhe took no greatreſt that night. But when morning was come, and every one awake and up, <hi>Cleontine</hi> wondered ſhe did not ſee her Niece; and fearing ſhe had not been well, ſhe went ſoftly to her bed-ſide; but when ſhe ſaw her all bloody, ſhe cryed out, thinking ſhe had been dead: All the houſe ran up to her, and found her kiſſing <hi>Celidea,</hi> though her face was nothing but wounds, and congealed blood: Oh heavens! Daughter, (ſaid the good old woman) who has thus inhumanly uſed you? What barbarous hand could finde a heart to ſpoil this fair face? <hi>Celidea,</hi> in a low voice, beſeeched her, to let her reſt, and ſhe ſhould know who had done it, as ſoon as <hi>Thamires</hi> and <hi>Calidon</hi> were come. Chirurgeons were immediately ſent for, and <hi>Thamires,</hi> hearing in what condition <hi>Celidea</hi> was, he ran preſently to her Chamber; but when he ſaw her, he ſtood immova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and gave no ſignes of life, but only by tears in his eyes. At the laſt, after a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting of himſelfe: Is this <hi>Celidea,</hi> whom I ſee in this ſad plight, ſaid he? Could the gods ever permit ſuch a piece of cruelty? What Tiger, in the ſhape of a Man, could have a heart to do it? Was ever ſo much inhumanity executed? <hi>Celidea</hi> turning gently towards him: <hi>Thamires,</hi> ſaid ſhe, though you have loſt the face of <hi>Celidea,</hi> yet ſhe hath preſerved all the reſt of her ſelfe; if you will permit me to take revenge, I will tell you who hath done this unto me. <hi>Calidon</hi> upon this came into the Chamber, which hindred <hi>Thamires</hi> from returning anſwer; and <hi>Calidon</hi> hearing of this accident, he had run himſelfe ſo out of breath, that he could not ſpeak, yet one might hear him utter vowes, that the villain who had thus injured <hi>Celidea,</hi> ſhould not live till night. Oh <hi>Calidon,</hi> ſaid ſhe, do not ſwear, leſt you ſhould be perjured; perhaps it may be ſuch a one, as you had rather die then keep your oath. I do ſwear ſtill by <hi>Heſius,</hi> replyed <hi>Calidon,</hi> and by my own ſoul, who ere he be, except <hi>Thamires,</hi> he ſhall die. Upon this, he kneeled down by her bed ſide, and offering to kiſſe her hand, ſhe puſhed him back: <hi>Calidon;</hi> ſaid ſhe, why ſhould you offer to kiſſe my hand? Look upon my face, and take notice, that I am not now the ſame <hi>Celidea,</hi> whoſe beauty you ſo much eſteemed. The ſhepheard was ſo tranſported with fury, that he had not yet looked upon her; but when he fixed his eyes upon her, and ſaw her ſo gaſtly transformed, he ſtood more aſtoniſhed then <hi>Thamires:</hi> Then laying his hand upon his eyes, and turning his head the other way, it was impoſſible for him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the ſight, and ſtared like a man that had been frighted. She all the while was not at all angry, but with incredible courage endured it. Then holding out her hand unto <hi>Thamires:</hi> Friend, ſaid ſhe unto him, I hope this will be contentment unto you, to ſee, that I am all yours, and that none now can or will ever pretend unto me: This face thus disfigured, was only done, to make me only yours. I cannot believe, <hi>Thamires,</hi> but that your affection unto me was built upon a better foundation, then a fading face. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſee you deſirous to know, who it was that made me thus; know, <hi>Thamires,</hi> that it was <hi>Calidon:</hi> And you, <hi>Calidon,</hi> know, that it was <hi>Thamires.</hi> Did you put her into this condition, cried they both out? Yes, ſaid ſhe, it is <hi>Calidon,</hi> and <hi>Thamires,</hi> that have thus wronged <hi>Celidea:</hi> But have a little patience, and you ſhall hear, how. Every one did wonder at theſe words, but eſpecially the two ſhepheards. And when <hi>Calidon</hi> offered to ſpeak, ſhe interrupted him thus: <hi>Calidon,</hi> do not go about to excuſe your ſelfe; for, though <hi>Thamires</hi> and you both be the cauſe, yet you are more to blame then he. There is none that knowes me is ignorant, how <hi>Thamires</hi> hath loved me from my infancy, and hath ever ſince continued his affection to me; this affection became reciprocall, as ſoon as ever I was capable of Love; and as his addreſſes unto me did invite me to love him, ſo the
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:53526:194"/>
good entertainment that he found from me, invited him to continue it: And indeed how happily had we lived unto this very day, if <hi>Calidon</hi> had not caſt his eye upon me; ſo as I may ſay, and <hi>Thamires</hi> knowes it, that never two loved each other better, than <hi>Thamires</hi> and <hi>Celidea:</hi> But as ſoon as <hi>Calidon</hi> came, all our happineſſe and contentment was bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted; firſt, by his ſickneſſe; afterwards, by the gift which <hi>Thamires</hi> made of me unto him, which I could never conſent unto. Truth is, after I had long endured the faintneſſe of <hi>Thamires,</hi> I and the fiery affection of <hi>Calidon,</hi> I rejected them both, as in reaſon I might, ſince <hi>Calidon</hi> had made me loſe <hi>Thamires,</hi> and <hi>Thamires</hi> without cauſe, had reſigned me to <hi>Calidon.</hi> Afterwards, when I was wholly adjudged unto <hi>Thamires,</hi> by the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Nymph <hi>Leonida,</hi> yet ſtill was I tormented by him; when he was in all reaſon obliged to decline me, both out of duty of a friend, and the Nymphs command; yet ſtill he perſiſted, and would needs die. On the other ſide, the kinde nature of <hi>Thamires,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Nephew in that condition, did leave me in bed, and made it appear, that his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection unto <hi>Calidon</hi> was greater, then his love to me, whom he had courted with ſo much earneſtneſſe and paſſion. I was extreamly aſtoniſhed at this accident, when I was told, that both my Husband and his Nephew were brought in chaires as dead. I muſt confeſſe, that when I ſaw them, and heard how all was, I knew not what to reſolve upon. But afterwards, conſidering the whole ſtate of the matter, I lifted up my heart unto <hi>Thara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi> beſeeching him to adviſe me what courſe to take, to compoſe this buſineſſe. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he did inſpire me with the means. This therefore, Oh ſhepheards, was the holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration: Conſider (ſaid that god unto me) the violent affection of <hi>Calidon,</hi> and be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of this, that he will never leave you, as long as you are fair; never think, that either religion to the gods, or any duty to men, will reſtrain him: Nor can you imagine, that <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires,</hi> though he be your Husband, and love you above his life, can ever enjoy any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, as long as he ſees his Nephew ſo tormented. As for your part, What kinde of life can you hope to live, as long as you are the cauſe of both their miſeries? To give your ſelfe unto <hi>Calidon,</hi> your own will cannot conſent unto it; beſides, you are already devoted unto <hi>Thamires,</hi> that nothing can ſeparate you, but death. The violent paſſion of <hi>Calidon</hi> will not ſuffer you to be quiet with <hi>Thamires;</hi> nor can the kinde nature of <hi>Thamires,</hi> endure the continuall diſpleaſures of his Nephew. What then, <hi>Celidea,</hi> cauſt thou do? Put on a generous reſolution, and deprive thy ſelfe of that, which is the root of all this diſſention. Cauſt thou think it any thing elſe, but the beauty of thy face? 'Tis true, anſwered I; but in loſing that beauty, I ſhall alſo loſe the love of <hi>Thamires</hi> as well as <hi>Calidon;</hi> and if ſo, I had better die. You are deceived, anſwered he, the love of theſe two ſhepheards is different; <hi>Thamires</hi> loves <hi>Celidea,</hi> and <hi>Calidon</hi> adores the beauty of <hi>Celidea.</hi> If your fears ſhould prove true, you had better die preſently, then live long; and be aſſured, that when age has made you unhandſome, <hi>Thamires</hi> will ceaſe to love you. But, let that be the leaſt of your fears, <hi>Thamires</hi> loves <hi>Celidea,</hi> and let <hi>Celidea</hi> become what ſhe will, ſtill <hi>Thamires</hi> will love her.</p>
               <p>This, Shepheards was the ſacred counſell, which the gods did inſpire into me, unto which I durſt not be diſobedient, and therefore ſought out for means to put it in execution; ſo as having heard my Aunt ſay, that the wounds which were made by a Diamond, would never heal, I intended to ſacrifice that beauty which was in my face, unto your tranquillity and union. But, Oh my <hi>Thamires!</hi> I hope you will not ceaſe loving <hi>Celidea,</hi> though ſhe has not the ſame face ſhe had; for, what ſhe has done, was only to ſatisfie the deſires of <hi>Calidon,</hi> that ſhe might be entirely yours. Thus ended <hi>Celidea,</hi> leaving all that heard her full of admiration at her generous act. It would be too long and tedious to relate <hi>Calidon</hi>'s reproching her, the diſpleaſure of <hi>Thamires,</hi> the ſorrowes of <hi>Cleontine</hi> and <hi>Celidea</hi>'s Mother, with all thoſe that conſidered her condition. But ſo it was, that when the Chirurgions had dreſſed her pittifull ſacrificed face, they all concluded, that ſhe would never recover her beauty again; for the cuts were ſo deep, and in ſuch places, that they had for ever ſpoiled all her delicate features and proportion. So it falls out, that <hi>Calidon</hi> ſeeing her ſo deformed, his fiery flaming paſſion did quite extinguiſh; and <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires,</hi> as ſhe hoped, continues his love; ſo as ſhe has ever ſince lived in abundance of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and quietneſſe, and ſo much eſteemed and honoured by every one, as ſhe hath vowed, that ſhe never in all her life received halfe that contentment from her beauty, as ſhe has ſince from her deformity.</p>
               <p>You have related (ſaid <hi>Leonida)</hi> the moſt generous and commendable act, that ever was done by a woman; and I am extreamly glad to hear, that ſuch a vertuous reſolution
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:53526:194"/>
ſhould proceed from one, ſo neerly allyed unto me, as <hi>Celidea</hi> is; I beſeech the gods, to make her as happy in <hi>Thamires,</hi> as <hi>Thamires</hi> has reaſon to love her, and eſteem her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Now (continued <hi>Lycidas) Thamires</hi> thinking he ſhall never have any Children, he would gladly make a match between <hi>Calidon</hi> and <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> and to invite <hi>Phocion</hi> unto it, he offers to give him all his Lands and Flocks. <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> who grieves ſo for the loſſe of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and reſolves never to love any again, ſhe will not upon any termes hear of it; and when her Uncle made the motion unto her, ſhe did nothing but weep; inſomuch as when he preſſed her unto it, ſhe anſwered, That ſhe would ſpend all the reſt of her daies amongſt the Veſtalls and Druides: ſo as in order unto that, ſhe deſired me to ſpeak unto the venerable <hi>Chriſante</hi> about it. Do you think, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> that <hi>Chriſante</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her, without the conſent of her Parents? I asked her the very ſame queſtion, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Lycidas,</hi> but ſhe anſwered me, that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> having neither Father nor Mother living, ſhe might diſpoſe of her ſelfe; and that if ſhe could not diſpoſe of her ſelfe this way, ſhe would then enter into her grave. I perceive, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> that ſhe is exceſſively afflicted: But I pray tell me, who is contented? Would I durſt tell you, anſwered the ſhepheard. Why ſhould you make more difficuly in telling me that, replyed the Nymph, then in telling me the reſt? There are many reaſons for it, replyed he, but, ſince I have gone ſo far, I will venter to go a little farther, therefore, Madam, be pleaſed to know, that it is <hi>Phillis</hi> whom I mean: But, I moſt humbly beſeech you, to ask me no farther. I cannot chuſe, ſaid ſhe, but ſwell with a ſtrange curioſity at your requeſt, and do wonder, why you ſhould ſo conceal that, which I do ſo extreamly deſire to know: For, loving <hi>Phillis</hi> as I do, why would you not have me enquire of her contentment? But I perceive, you do ſtrictly obſerve the Lawes of Love, the chiefe of which is, to <hi>Conceal and be ſilent.</hi> And becauſe he would needs ſeem, as if it did not concern him: Nay, nay, ſaid ſhe, never think to hide your ſelfe from me; for, ſhepheard, I do know more of you, then you imagine: Can you think, I could frequent the company of all your ſhepheards and ſhepheardeſſes, and not hear, how you are a ſervant unto <hi>Phillis;</hi> and how, after a long continued ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, you are at the laſt growne jealous of <hi>Silvander?</hi> Certainly I ſhould have been of a very dull compoſition, if ſeeing ſo compleat a ſhepheard as <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and loving <hi>Phillis</hi> as I do, I had not enquired of your life. If I did ſeem, ſhepheard, as if I were ignorant, it was only out of diſcretion, for I do know as much of your affaires, as you do almoſt your ſelfe; and if you will, I will tell you ſuch particulars, as ſhall make you confeſſe it. <hi>Lycidas</hi> hearing her ſay ſo, he was extreamly confuſed, and thought, that all her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge came from <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Phillis.</hi> I perceive, ſaid he, that you are acquainted with my follies, and that things are not ſo ſecretly carried, as I wiſh they were: But to make it appear, that I am as much your ſervant, as your Informers can be, I will tell you more then they could, ſince they are paſſages which hapned, ſince they had the honour to ſee you; ſtill beſeeching you to be ſecret. I have ſo great an eſteem, anſwered the Nymph, both of the verſue of <hi>Phillis,</hi> and of your merits, as you may be moſt certain, I ſhall be ſecret in any thing that concernes either of you: And you may ſee, I can be ſilent, ſince I was ſo long before I imparted unto you what I did know. But when you told me, that <hi>Phillis</hi> was contented, I wondred, becauſe I knew her to be much troubled at your faintneſſe and jealouſie. Oh great Nymph, (ſaid <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and ſmiled) great alterations have been, ſince I had the honour to ſee you: Oh how oft have I been upon my knees? Believe it, Madam, <hi>Phillis</hi> knowes how to bring me into my ſenſes, and can make me know my duty: Had I but time to tell you the whole ſeries of the ſtory, you ſhould ſee what abundance of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is, betwixt a Lover and a Wiſeman. I do not know any thing, replyed the Nymph, which I more deſire to know; and as for leaſure, you may have time enough, ſince <hi>Adamas, Phocion,</hi> and <hi>Diamis</hi> are entred into diſcourſe; for old men will never have an end of their old ſtories. The Nymphs chiefe end in holding him thus in diſcourſe, was, in conſideration of <hi>Alexis,</hi> leſt he ſhould take too much obſervance of her; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the firſt time to be the moſt dangerous, becauſe when the opinion was once fixed, it would better paſſe afterwards for currant, therefore ſhe deſired him to proceed. <hi>Lycidas</hi> thinking it would be pleaſing unto the Nymph, began thus.</p>

                  <hi>The Hiſtory of the jealous</hi> Lycidas.</head>
               <p>YOu know Madam that the familiar converſation which was between <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Silvander</hi> by reaſon of their ſtriving which ſhould make <hi>Diana</hi> love them beſt, was the cauſe of my jealouſie. A jealouſy, which I may well ſay, was within a ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of madneſſe. Inſomuch as I have often wondered, how it was poſſible I ſhould live in that torment: The paines of death could not be greater: Every houre, ſome accident or other added freſh tortures: my eye could not turne itſelf without findingout ſome new aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of miſery: And worſt of all, when I had greateſt curioſity to find out the cauſes of my diſpleaſures: Nay my imagination would fancy things ſo beyond all manner of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; as I wonder how it was poſſible my judgement ſhould be perverted. When ſhe ſpoke any thing freely unto <hi>Silvander,</hi> Oh how every accent pierced me to the heart. When ſhe was ſilent, and did not ſpeake at all, I concluded ſhe diſſembled; when ſhe carraſſed me, I thought ſhe had a deſigne to deceive me; when ſhe ſlighted me, I ſaid this was a ſigne of a change in her affection: when ſhe ſhunned <hi>Silvander,</hi> I thought ſhe did ſo, leſt I ſhould ſee her; if ſhe applyed her ſelfe unto him, then I thought ſhe was deſirous to vexe me, and ſhew how well ſhe was contented in her new affection. If ſhe was not at any time ſad, then I ſaid there was ſome amorous quarrell fallen out betwixt them. To be briefe, every thing ſhe did offended me: And when there was nothing to ground my diſpleaſure upon, I ſhould accuſe my judgement for being ſo ſimple, as not to ſee their diſſimulations. How oft have I wiſht my ſelfe no eyes, that I could not ſee neither <hi>Silvander</hi> nor <hi>Phillis.</hi> But to what purpoſe would that be (ſaid I preſently after) for though I were blind, yet they would love? But, ſaid I, it were much better to loſe my love, ſince the thought of it doth thus torment me, and ever will, till I be in my grave. See unto what extremity I was driven, ſince in lieu of loving <hi>Phillis,</hi> I did hate her. I could have wiſhed her ugly, and yet I ſhould have been very ſorry if ſhe had loſt the leaſt part of her beauty and handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And this I found preſently at the ſame time: for ſhe having had three or foure fits of an ague, which had cauſed a little alteration in her face, I was ſo diſpleaſed at it, that ſhe herſelfe obſerved me. Living therefore, or rather languiſhing in this manner, and almoſt reduced unto an abſolute deſpaire, the gods had pitty upon me. One Night <hi>Silvander</hi> chanced to fall aſleep in the wood, neere unto the Temple of the good goddeſſe: when he awaked he found a Letter in his hand; not knowing how it came. Upon his returne he ſhewed it unto <hi>Diana,</hi> and the ſhepherdeſſe <hi>Aſtrea:</hi> they thought it to be writ by the hand of <hi>Celadon:</hi> and they hoping to heare more of him in the place where this Letter was found, they entreated <hi>Silvander</hi> to conduct them thither. When they were there, night ſo ſurpriſed them, that they were forced to ſtay there, untill it was day. During this ſhort time, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> fell aſleep, and had ſuch dreames and viſions as cauſed her to think that <hi>Celadon</hi> was in pain, and that his Ghoſt walked, becauſe he had not received the laſt office of a buriall: ſhe therefore reſolved to erect an empty Tombe for him, but thought it more expedient to be done in the name of <hi>Paris</hi> then her owne; theſe cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were ſo long and the ſhepheardeſſes ſo weary, that at their return they went into their owne cabins to reſt themſelves. For my part I left them betimes, and after I had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned retired my ſelfe into a thick covert neere the way which conducts to our Towne: It is ſo thick with underwood, as, though it joyne upon the high way, yet it was impoſſible I ſhould be ſeen. And yet I could plainy ſee all paſſengers going or comming. After a long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of my owne thoughts, ſleepe did ſo ſurpriſe me, that I did not waken untill the Sun was almoſt ſet. And intending to retire, I would firſt ſee whether any were in the medow, that I might avoyd meeting with <hi>Philis.</hi> By fortune I eſpyed <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and her, who having reſted themſelves in their Cabins, came to walk in the freſh Aire of that place. On the other ſide, I ſaw <hi>Silvander</hi> following them, thinking, (as I beleeve) that <hi>Diana</hi> would come unto them, I hid my ſelfe againe in the covert, deſireous to ſee what they did, and beleeving they would give me ſome freſh knowledge of their affection. But it happened, that <hi>Silvander</hi> ſeeing them ſit downe under the covert where I was, he came to ſit amongſt them. <hi>Phillis</hi> ſhe quitted her place and went ſome twenty paces from them. Then I heard <hi>Aſtrea</hi> call her, and <hi>Silvander</hi> beſeech her to come unto them. Oh what ſmarting wounds did theſe words make in my heart? Yet <hi>Phillis</hi> came not: but ſhewed herſelfe to be very much diſcontented at the Shepheard. But whereas this might well have
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:53526:195"/>
contented me, it did the more offend me, conceiving that there are alwayes ſuch pretty quarrells amongſt lovers, as do but renew love. <hi>Phillis</hi> was ſome twenty paces from them, as I told you, and would not come neere them, but ſtill walked alone by herſelfe: At which <hi>Silvander</hi> began to ſmile, and at laſt he could not hold but laugh very loud. <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> hearing him and being much enflamed with anger againſt him; <hi>Silvander</hi> (ſaid ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him) your behaviour towards me, does make me hate you even to death: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it, if ever any occaſion of revenge offer it ſelfe unto me, I will lay hold upon it. The ſhepheard hearing her utter theſe words with ſo much paſſion, he burſt out into ſuch a violent fit of laughter, that he could not give any anſwere. Well well (ſaid <hi>Phillis)</hi> laugh on, uncivill ſhepheard, do your worſt to offend me, perhaps I ſhall one day finde an opportunity of revenge, and if I do not take it, never truſt <hi>Phillis</hi> againe. When <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſaw this, ſhe took part with <hi>Phillis:</hi> I did not think (ſaid ſhe) that <hi>Silvander</hi> whom I ever found diſcret and full of civility, would offer to offend <hi>Phillis</hi> without any cauſe. <hi>Phillis</hi> hearing <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſay ſo, ſhe was more animated againſt the ſhepheard: He cares not a ſtraw (ſaid ſhe) for offending me; but he has good reaſon for it, for he knowes I never cared for him, nor can he well incenſe me more againſt him, then I was before. Oh how this diſſention did pleaſe me? and yet I could not chuſe but be angry he ſhould ſo ſlight her. <hi>Silvander,</hi> he adreſſed himſelfe unto <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> Are you, faire ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe (ſaid he) ſo angry againſt me? I thought that you would have taken my part. I can never take part againſt reaſon (anſwered <hi>Aſtrea)</hi> but me thinkes you might do much better then to give my companion ſo much occaſion to hate you. Truly (ſaid he in ſerious earneſt) although you are partially biaſſed on <hi>Phillis</hi> ſide, yet I am contented you ſhould be the judge of our difference. Provided ſhe wil before you, declare the occaſion of her anger againſt me; and when you have heard us both, I will preſently ſubmit unto what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment you ſhall pleaſe to ſentence: Who I, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſhould I reaſon any buſineſſe with you? No no, I had rather I were dumb as long as I lived then to have any thing to do with h you. For all this, replyed he, I would tell you ſomthing which perhaps would make it appeare that <hi>Silvander</hi> is more your ſervant then you imagine. Then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> he beſeeched her to intreat <hi>Phillis</hi> to ſit downe, which ſhe did: not, ſaid ſhe, that I have any deſire to heare you, but only becauſe I will do whatſoever <hi>Aſtrea</hi> commands me. <hi>Silvander</hi> without any reply unto her, began thus. I beleeve <hi>Phillis</hi> you do not think me ſo ignorant in the affaires of the world, as that I ſhould never hear of that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which is betwixt you and <hi>Lycidas.</hi> Nay perhaps you will wonder I ſhould know ſo much and ſeeme ſo ignorant. So as you will not judge this <hi>Silvander</hi> whom you wiſh ſo ill, was ſo little your ſervant as you think him. But ſo it is ſhepherdeſſe that I did know all particulars, from ſuch as are inquiſitive into the buſineſſes of others, and afterwards I knew both from your ſelf and <hi>Lycidas.</hi> Do you not remember how one day when you retired your ſelfe from much company, you commanded <hi>Hylas</hi> to relate the ſtory of his life and the adventures of his ſeverall Loves? Do you remember when you went away, you deſired <hi>Aſtrea</hi> to go along with you? Have you forgotten how you went into the wood to ſpeak with <hi>Lycidas</hi> who waited there for you? and how <hi>Aſtrea</hi> told you that you ſhould take heed leſt he tooke it not ill? alſo how you anſwered her, that he was ſo importunate that you could not deny him, but therefore you tooke <hi>Aſtrea</hi> with you? Now, ſhepheardeſſe, think well upon the diſcourſe which you had with him: you need not tell it unto me, for I know it all as well as if I had heard it.</p>
               <p>At this, they both bluſhed, and ſtood ſo amazed that they could not ſpeak but looked upon each other. Nay, never be troubled (ſaid <hi>Silvander)</hi> that I do know all theſe things, for I am diſcreet enough to conceale any thing: but if you pleaſe, faire <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I will tell you how angry <hi>Lycidas</hi> was againſt you, and what paines you tooke to qualfie him; you may ſee, I do almoſt know as much of your buſineſſes as you your ſelves do: Know <hi>Phillis</hi> that I was not ignorant either of the jealouſie of <hi>Lycidas,</hi> or the cauſe of his jealouſie. I am ſure (replyed my ſhepheardeſſe and looking him in the face) that you have ſo behaved your ſelfe towards me, as hath extreamly troubled both <hi>Lycidas,</hi> and me, and your ſelfe alſo. Oh, ſhepheardeſſe (anſwered he) you are more obliged unto me, then you imagine; for what would you have me to do? Since you knew (ſaid ſhe) that <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas</hi> was jealous of you, you ſhould have abſented your ſelfe from me. You bid me do things impoſſible, (replyed he) and ſuch as had been infinitly prejudicall unto you, if I had done them Impoſſible, becauſe I having undertaken to ſerve <hi>Diana</hi> and you being conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually with her, it was impoſſible for me to be abſent from you unleſſe I had been abſent,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:53526:196"/>
from both. Had you been ſo good a friend to me as you might (ſaid <hi>Phillis)</hi> you would rather have abſented your ſelfe from <hi>Diana,</hi> and hazard the loſſe of your wager, then have made <hi>Lycidas</hi> ſo jealous, and me ſo ſad: for that ſhepheard was much your friend, and I had never given you any occaſion to be mine enemy. I perceive ſhepheardeſſe, (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Silvander)</hi> that you never conſidered the hurt which you would have done me: nor how impoſſible it was for me to do it. If I did do you any hurt, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> it was out of ignorance, for I did not intend it: However, replyed he, you did do me hurt, and I was very ſenſible of it. I beſeech you which way (ſaid <hi>Phillis)</hi> are not you the cauſe of my undertaking to ſerve <hi>Diana?</hi> (anſwered he) What then (ſaid <hi>Phillis)</hi> why do you accuſe me? I do accuſe you (ſaid <hi>Silvander)</hi> of all the miſeries that ever I reſented. For in lieu of counterfeiting love, I do love in good earneſt. Upon this, the ſhepheard made a ſtop, as if he were ſorry he had ſaid ſo much: which <hi>Aſtrea</hi> perceiving. Never vexe, ſaid ſhe, nor bluſh at the confeſſion of a truth; perhaps theſe words are not the firſt that gave us knowledge of it. I am not aſhamed, anſwered he, that I ſhould ſay, I am <hi>Diana's</hi> ſervant, but much aſhamed of mine owne immerits of that honour. If <hi>Diana</hi> (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Aſtrea)</hi> were to be wone by merits, I know none that may better pretend unto her then <hi>Silvander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I wiſh with all my ſoul, Faire ſhepheardeſſe, replyed he, that every one were of the ſame opinion. Oh Madam, ſaid <hi>Lycidas,</hi> how pleaſing were theſe words unto my ſoul? How, ſaid <hi>Leonida,</hi> is it poſſible <hi>Silvander</hi> ſhould love <hi>Diana</hi> in earneſt? Doubtleſſe he doth, ſaid he, and I ſhall tell you more another time; but for the preſent, I ſhall onely tell you how I was delivered from my tormenting jealouſie. I heard therefore how <hi>Silvander</hi> continued his diſcourſe thus: Now not being able to be abſent from you, becauſe of your continuall preſence with <hi>Diana,</hi> what would you have had me done? be you your ſelfe the Judge. You ought not, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> to have given <hi>Lycidas</hi> any occaſion of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, at the firſt: and afterwards, when you ſaw how jealous he was, though you could not be abſent from me by reaſon of <hi>Diana,</hi> yet you might very well have behaved your ſelfe more modeſtly and coldly to me, when <hi>Lycidas</hi> was preſent: Oh what a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſt in love you are, ſaid he, did you take notice of the minute when <hi>Lycidas</hi> grew firſt jealous? No ſaid ſhe, and do you think, ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> that I ſhould perceive it better then you? Diſeaſes in love, do beginne like other diſeaſes, inſenſibly, and none can have knowledge of them: So as I could not give a ſtop unto the originall of his jealouſy no more then you could: As for the progreſſe, I think that I have infinitely obliged you by it: becauſe had I then declined you, or ſpoke leſſe affectionately to you, what might he have thought? only that the cauſe of my declining you and behaving my ſelfe otherwiſe then uſually, I did intend to delude him, and held a private coreſpondency with you? would he not have bin more enflamed with jealouſie. Believe it <hi>Phillis,</hi> it was very requiſite I ſhould continue my carriage towards you as I begun it; otherwiſe, he would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have ſuſpected it diſſimulation, and concluded Diſſimulation to be a co-incident unto Love.</p>
               <p>I being now put out of all my long and tormenting doubts, and plainly finding that there was no love betwixt them, I cryed out, Oh <hi>Phillis, Silvander</hi> is in the right: Then I ran and fell downe upon my knees before them, at which they were both ſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as they looked upon one another and could not ſpeak. For my part I was ſo over joyed at my fortune, as I knew not what words to chuſe whereby I might thank love for the favor. At the laſt I addreſſed my ſelf unto her in this manner, my faireſt Shepheardeſſe, I muſt needs confeſſe my fault deſerves puniſhment no pardon: I am here upon my knees at your mercy: Doome me to what puniſhment you pleaſe, ſo you will but forget my crime. Such expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as theſe I uſed unto her. At which without any returne of anſwer, ſhe turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, and looked upon the ground. Both ſhe and I ſtanding mute, <hi>Silvander</hi> would needs be a cauſe of my contentment as he had been of my ſorrowes. Therefore, ſhephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe (ſaid he) as I have been a witneſſe, that <hi>Lycidas</hi> hath been jealous without cauſe, ſo ſhall I witneſſe that you are fuller of revenge then love, if you do not accept of this ſatisfaction which he offers. Never ſtudy any longer what you have to do, pardon him as you ought; His affection deſerves it, and yours commands it. Siſter, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea, Silvander</hi> ſayes very truly: and you may be certain of this, that it was rather exceſſe then any defect of love which hath cauſed <hi>Lycidas</hi> to commit this errour: and if it be a fault, he repents and hath done ſufficient pennance. Then <hi>Phillis</hi> looking upon me: <hi>Lycidas</hi> (ſaid ſhe) you have ſo extreamly offended me, that it is very hard to paſſe it over: but
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:53526:196"/>
ſince <hi>Aſtrea</hi> will have it ſo, I pardon you, but with a vow, that if ever you relapſe into the like fault, you ſhall loſe all hopes of ever recovering my affection again. Fie, fie, <hi>Lycidas,</hi> continued ſhe, could you be ſo weak, and think me ſo light, as to love every one I looked upon: Were the aſſurances which I had given you of my affection, ſo ſmall, as that you ſhould ſo eaſily doubt them? Doubtleſſe ſhe had continued on, (for I was not able to ſpeak) if <hi>Aſtrea</hi> had not interrupted her: Siſter, ſaid ſhe unto her, you have ſaid enough, <hi>Lycidas</hi> is all penitence and ſubmiſſion, and you will ſin againſt the goodneſſe of your own nature, if you inſult too much upon him. <hi>Phillis,</hi> after a little conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, addreſſed her ſelfe unto her Companion, in this language: Siſter, I will not only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the offence, but alſo forget it, provided, that for the future, he never give me any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to remember it. Thus, Madam, was I cured, thus was my crime pardoned; and <hi>Silvander</hi> and I, have lived ſince in ſo kinde a familiarity, that, next my poor Brother, I never loved any man better. And are you not afraid, (ſaid <hi>Leonida)</hi> that <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> being ſo much together, ſhould make you jealous again? For, he that loves is naturally ſubject unto ſuſpition. No, ſaid <hi>Lycidas;</hi> for firſt, I have full aſſurance in the affection of <hi>Phillis;</hi> and ſecondly, <hi>Silvander</hi>'s love of <hi>Diana,</hi> who I know cannot admit of a Companion.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Lycidas</hi> and <hi>Leonida</hi> diſcourſed, whilſt <hi>Hylas</hi> entertaining <hi>Alexis,</hi> began by little and little to be in love with her. And ſhe having an opinion, that this would be a meanes to make it more believed, that ſhe was a woman, ſhe endeavoured to kindle his flame as much as ſhe could; and though ſhe had never ſeen him before, yet <hi>Leonida</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> had acquainted her with his pleaſant humour. <hi>Hylas,</hi> according to his free hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, cryed out upon a ſudden: <hi>Phillis,</hi> I have thought upon it, I muſt now fairly bid you Adieu; all that I can do, is, to give you the ſame liberty, that I take my ſelfe. <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Corilas</hi> hearing this ſuddain reſolution, and ſeeing that <hi>Alexis</hi> could not ſpeak for laughing, they could not chuſe but take the part of <hi>Phillis,</hi> purpoſely to begin occaſion of ſome pleaſant diſcourſe. Why, ſhepheard, (ſaid <hi>Corilas,)</hi> do you caſt off the fair <hi>Phillis</hi> in this manner? She has reaſon to obſerve this, as one of her black and fatall daies. What can I help it, ſaid <hi>Hylas?</hi> Why is ſhee not as fair as <hi>Alexis?</hi> Oh heavens, (replyed <hi>Corilas)</hi> who can hereafter have any aſſurance in your affection? That may this moſt lovely Nymph, anſwered he, who is fairer then <hi>Phillis.</hi> But, ſaid <hi>Corilas,</hi> is not this a moſt manifeſt ſigne of your levity and fickleneſſe? Not at all, anſwered he, but rather an argument of the great beauty in <hi>Alexis.</hi> If beauty be the matter, ſaid <hi>Corilas, Phillis</hi> is not defective in it. She hath leſſe then <hi>Alexis,</hi> ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> for ſhe is not able to hold me, now I have ſeen the other; and therefore I muſt fairly take my leave of her. <hi>Silvander,</hi> who had been long ſilent, ſeeing <hi>Corilas</hi> did not reply, he undertook the diſcourſe for him: It is not any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the beauty of <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſaid he, which moveth this ſhepheard to make his retreat, but it is his owne naturall inconſtancy. Very well, (ſaid <hi>Hylas)</hi> do you call it incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, when one goes on ſtep by ſtep, unto the place where they intend to arrive? No, ſaid <hi>Silvander.</hi> And yet, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſuch a one does ſet his foot, ſometimes upon the ground, ſometimes in the air, ſometimes before, ſometimes behinde: And is not this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy as well as that which you lay in my diſh? For, intending to arrive at a perfect beauty, I do ſet one foot before another, and never leave changing, till I arrive at my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended place. Even ſo have I done, by all I have hitherto loved, untill I found <hi>Alexis,</hi> who I finde to be the moſt perfect beauty of all. This might hold good, anſwered <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vander,</hi> if you could demonſtrate to us, that you do merit to love <hi>Alexis:</hi> For, as you have gotten the name of Inconſtant, by loving ſo many; ſo now, you will get the name Preſumptuous, in loving <hi>Alexis. Alexis</hi> was long ſilent, taking great delight in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of theſe ſhepheards; but when ſhe heard her ſelfe ſo highly commended, ſhe thought it fit to ſpeak: Did I as much merit the affection of <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid ſhe, as I am willing to entertain it, certainly he ſhould have no ſmall reaſon to love me. Then tuming her ſelfe in a ſmiling manner towards <hi>Hylas:</hi> Servant, ſaid ſhe unto him, take heed, leſt the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of this ſhepheard ſhould divert you; for, you would wrong both your ſelfe and me, if it ſhould: It would be a ſhame for you, to attempt an enterpriſe, and ſo ſoon give it over; and it would be too evident an argument of my little merit, if you ſhould ſo ſoon quit me. But, <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid <hi>Silvander,</hi> do you not dread the diſpleaſure of <hi>Teupates,</hi> in addreſſing your ſelfe unto one, who is conſecrated unto him? Ignorant <hi>Silvander,</hi> ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> the gods do command us to love themſelves; and how can they be angry with

us, for loving that which is theirs? You ſee, ſaid <hi>Alexis,</hi> that this ſhepheard hath ſome deſigne upon us, he would cunningly turn you from me by artifice; for he knowes well enough, that if I will, I can leave off that profeſſion, which I have taken upon me.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe ſhepheards were thus talking, <hi>Adamas</hi> was entertaining <hi>Phocion, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis,</hi> and <hi>Tircis;</hi> and becauſe he eſteemed them very much, both for their age, their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and for his deſigne, in making a Match between <hi>Celadon</hi> and <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> he did all that poſſibly he could to bid them welcome: And becauſe <hi>Tircis</hi> was a ſtranger, and had never ſeen the raritles of his Houſe, he asked him, if he would take ſo much paines as to walk, and ſee it: And hearing him anſwer, that he did infinitly deſire it, he took him by the hand, and willed <hi>Paris</hi> to do the like unto <hi>Hylas</hi> and the reſt of the ſhepheards, if they had a minde. <hi>Alexis,</hi> with the help of <hi>Hylas,</hi> who led her by the arme, followed <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> with the reſt of the Company. The Houſe was very fine, and furniſhed with many excellent ſingularities; but becauſe the diſcourſe of it would be too long, we will ſpeak no more of it, then what is pertinent to our purpoſe. They entred then into a large Gallery, which had a proſpect of Plaines on the one ſide, and Mountains on the other, which made it very delectable and pleaſant. The ſides was Wanſcot fretted, and, betwixt the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, hung with Maps of the ſeverall Provinces of <hi>Gaul:</hi> At the higher end, hung Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of ſeverall Countries, Kings, and Emperours, and amongſt them, the Portractures of ſeverall very beautifull Women. The top was adorned with Gold and Azure, very richly imboſſed, with many ſeverall devices. Every one fixed their eyes upon that, which was moſt agreeable unto their fancies: But <hi>Hylas,</hi> whoſe heart was all for beauty, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon a Picture which contained two Ladies: See, (ſaid he) two very delicate faces; Which of theſe two ſhould one judge to be the fairer? <hi>Adamas,</hi> who heard him: That (ſaid he) on the right hand, is the Picture of the Mother in Law; and the other on the left, the Daughter in Law: Both of them were two Princeſſes, as fair and as wiſe as ever any, and as much toſſed and turmoiled by the ſtormes of Fortune, as any in our Times. This, which ſeemes the more aged, is the wiſe <hi>Placidia,</hi> Daughter unto the great <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius,</hi> Siſter unto <hi>Arcudius</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> Wife unto <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and Mother unto <hi>Valentiniaen,</hi> all five Emperours, whoſe Pictures are a little farther off. The other is the Picture of <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> Daughter unto <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Second, and Wife unto <hi>Valentinian,</hi> whom <hi>Genſerio</hi> carried into <hi>Affrica.</hi> They were two Princeſſes (ſaid <hi>Tircis)</hi> of great beauties, and as great extractions: But wherein was their Fortunes ſo averſe? I ſhall briefly tell you, (replyed <hi>Adamas)</hi> and ſhall thereby acquaint you with ſome of theſe Pieces which you ſee here. Then, after a while of ſilence, he began thus.</p>

                  <hi>The History of</hi> Placidia.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>THEODOSIUS,</hi> the firſt of that name, Emperour of the Eaſt, one of the greateſt Princes the World had, ſince <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> he had three Children: One, <hi>Arcadius,</hi> who after him, was Emperour of the Eaſt: Another, was <hi>Honorius,</hi> who was Emperour of the Weſt: And the third, was the wiſe <hi>Placidia,</hi> whoſe fortune was ſo various, that we ſee in her, how Vertue is ordinarily croſſed: For, ſhe being at the diſpoſe of her Brother <hi>Honorius,</hi> and he under the government of <hi>Stilicon,</hi> unto whoſe Guardianſhip the great <hi>Theodoſius</hi> had committed him, during his nonage, ſhe was ſo variouſly toſſed and tormented by ſeverall accidents, as if Fortune had made choice of her, to ſhew the power it hath in all human things, of which <hi>Stilicon</hi> was the greateſt cauſe, who having great power over the perſon of <hi>Honorius</hi> and the whole Empire, his ambition aſpired at more abſolute authority, and aimed to make himſelfe ſole Emperour, as when his deſignes were diſcovered it did plainly appear. He being a man of a deep reach, and managing his matters ſo, as might moſt condure to his deſired end and grandure, he thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for him to make uſe of policy and ſubtlety, where it was impoſſible for him to compaſſe it by force. His way was therefore at the firſt, to ſtretch his authority to the higheſt pitch before he made his intentions known, and afterwards, to fortifie himſelfe, by marrying his Daughter unto young <hi>Honorius;</hi> for the very name of Father in Law to an Emperour looked big, and procured him a great honour and fear. Afterwards, he held ſecret intelligence and correſpondency with all ſuch, as he thought fit inſtruments for the advancement of his deſigne: And laſtly, reſolved to weaken the Forces of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour as much as poſſibly he could, that when opportunity ſerved, he might the more eaſily ſeize upon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:53526:197"/>
At that time, all the world looked at <hi>Rome</hi> with an envious eye, and made it the butt of their Armes: The <hi>Goths,</hi> the <hi>Fruncks,</hi> and <hi>Burgundians,</hi> in <hi>Gaul;</hi> the <hi>Vandats</hi> and <hi>Almaines</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi> the <hi>Anglois</hi> and the <hi>Picts</hi> in <hi>Britany;</hi> the <hi>Hunnes</hi> and the <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides</hi> in <hi>Pannonia;</hi> To be briefe, every part of the whole Empire was ſo divided, as no part was entire but <hi>Italy.</hi> It fortuned, that <hi>Alarick</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> would not ſuffer it to enjoy more tranquillity, then Its neighbours of the Weſt; and therefore fell into it with ſuch a vaſt number of People, as it was impoſſible for <hi>Honorius</hi> to reſiſt him; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as to get him out again, he was adviſed to make a Peace with him, upon what termes ſoever he could get; unto which, he being of ho Warlick diſpoſition, but above all things loving tranquillity, he lent a willing ear. Peace then being propounded, it was ſo prudently managed, that <hi>Alarick</hi> conſented to retire beyond the <hi>Alpes,</hi> into ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces which were aſſigned him by the Emperour. At which, <hi>Stilicon,</hi> being malecontent, as thinking this agreement prejudiciall to his deſignes, he ſo tampered with an Officer, then in pay under the Emperour, that he procured him to charge ſome of <hi>Alarick</hi>'s For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as they were marching away without any miſtruſt: At which, <hi>Alarick</hi> was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt <hi>Honorius,</hi> that he returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> beſieged it, and, at the end of two years, took it, and entirely ſacked it: Although <hi>Honorius,</hi> to make it appear, that he never conſented unto this perfidie, did put the Traitor <hi>Stilicon</hi> to death, as ſoon as ever he heard, that he was the author of it. Thus this ambitious man came to a miſerable end, but not before he had put all <hi>Italy</hi> into a moſt miſerable flame: For <hi>Alarick,</hi> after he had plundered and burned this great City, and not yet loadned with ſpil, he pillaged all the Country about it, and laid it ſo ſadly waſte, as would have moved any Barbarian unto pitty. But that which was moſt deplorable, beſides the ruine of ſo many Temples, and the loſſe of ſo many rarities, with which the Emperours had erected and adorned this City, was the miſerable fortune which befell this wiſe Princeſſe, who through the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſeneſſe of a Brother, was deſtitute of all ſuccour. She, who by extraction was Daughter unto the <hi>Ceſars,</hi> and Siſter unto two Emperours, was, through the fault of another, a Captive in the hands of theſe Barbarians, her Country burned, the Temples prophaned, and ſhe in danger to loſe her life, or, that which was more deer unto her; had not <hi>Ataul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus,</hi> a Prince of <hi>Alarick</hi>'s blood, been taken with her beauty and vertue, and thought her worthy to be his Wife. But this Prince, ſeeing her ſo fair and ſo wiſe, and knowing her to be Daughter to the great <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> he fell ſo paſſionately in love with her, that he courted her in Marriage; and preſently after, by <hi>Alaricks</hi> conſent, did marry her. You may imagine, what force this wiſe Princeſſe did uſe upon her ſelfe, before ſhe conſented unto this Marriage and Alliance, and how prudent ſhe had need to be, in behaving her ſelfe amongſt ſuch a rude and barbarous people, ſo wiſely as ſhe did; god did in this make it appear, that he had pitty upon miſerable <hi>Rome;</hi> for, had it not been for this Alliance, it had been utterly ruined for ever. For it ſo fel out, that <hi>Alarick</hi> dyed at <hi>Corſienſes,</hi> and the Prince <hi>Ataulfus</hi> was by the common voice of the Army choſen King. If you look upon that Piece next unto <hi>Placidias,</hi> you will imagine him to be a ſterne and ſalvage perſon, more delighted in blood and war, then peace; and he had no ſooner gotten the abſolute power, but he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> with a deſigne to burne and utterly demoliſh it, thinking, that as long as the Walls of this Town ſtood, there would be ſtill a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour; which name was ſo odious unto him, that he would abſolutely deſtroy the very memory of it. When this prudent Princeſſe underſtood his intention, ſhe was reſolved to do all that poſſibly ſhe could to prevent him, the utter ruine of her Country wounding her to the very ſoul. At the firſt, ſhe ſhewed her ſelfe ſwelled with abundance of griefe and ſorrow, tears did abundantly flow from her fair eyes, ſhe refuſed her reſt and meat, and never ceaſed tormenting her ſelfe, but when <hi>Ataulfus</hi> was by her, and then ſhe conſtrained her ſelfe to put as good a face upon it as ſhe could. This Prince, who loved her ſo well as to marry her, could not long endure to ſee her live thus, but he muſt needs aske her the cauſe of her diſcontents; unto which ſhe made this anſwer; I have done all that I poſſibly could O great King, to hide my exceſſive ſorrowes from you, fearing I ſhould but the more vex and trouble you with them: but, ſince nature will not permit me to conceal the ſadneſſe of my ſoul any longer, and ſince the goodneſſe of <hi>Ataulfus</hi> unto the wretched <hi>Placidia</hi> is ſuch, as to ask me; I do moſt humbly beſeech you, take it not ill, if I ſhed my tears in lieu of my blood, for my Country's ſad deſolation; and if, to ſtop the ruine of it, I could effect it, I would much more willingly ſhed my blood then my tears. My Country, Oh great Sir, my native Country that gave me breath, it bleeds, and it is ready to bleed
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:53526:198"/>
to death; and can you think, I would not moſt willingly part with my life to ſtop the wounds' Alas, it would be better imployed that way, then in your ſervice. Since you are pleaſed to do me ſo great a favour, as to aske me the cauſe of my ſorrowes, I beſeech you give me leave in all humility to aske you, What advantage will the ruine of <hi>Rome</hi> and all <hi>Italy</hi> be unto you? Does the riches and the treaſures of it, invite you to it? Surely thoſe are things too low, and unworthy of your high courage; beſides, thoſe are things that cannot be expected out of an already ruined and plundered Country, or a demoliſhed and halfe burned Towne, which hath been already ravaged by a vaſt Army: Is it any glory that you expect to get by it? I cannot believe it; for, what glory can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto that, which you have already; or, what hopes is there to get, in ruining thoſe Walls, which are already demoliſhed; in maſſacring a naked and diſarmed people, who cannot be brought into greater ſubmiſſion then they are? If it be a ſhame to wound a dying man, what honour can you expect, in giving freſh wounds unto a dying people? If you think to ſtrengthen your Dominion by it, be pleaſed, Oh great Sir, to let me tell you, that it would be moſt horrid cruelty to do it, by exterminating all the people of <hi>Italy.</hi> Should you put them all to the ſword, you would be in leſſe ſecurity then you are; for, you would thereby incenſe and raiſe againſt you, the Armes of all <hi>Aſia,</hi> of all <hi>Affrica,</hi> and of all the reſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> whereof <hi>Italy</hi> is but a poor pittance. Judge, great King, what likelyhood there is, that you, or any human upon earth, ſhould withſtand ſo many Provinces, conquer ſo many Kings, and get to himſelfe ſo many Worlds, for ſo may the Kingdomes and vaſt extent of the Roman Empire be called; ſo as the ruine of <hi>Italy</hi> will bring upon you the hatred of god and man: Men will revenge the wrong, done unto the capitall City upon earth; the gods will be offended at the ruine of that Towne, which is the miracle of the world, and which they have raiſed to that height, to pleaſe themſelves, and aſtoniſh men.</p>
               <p>If you will but be pleaſed, to take all theſe things into your wiſe, and ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, you will finde it much better, to make your ſelfe friends, and to oblige my two Brothers and their Empires, confirming, by a good correſpondency with them, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance which is already betwixt you. Why, Sir, did you honour me, to make me your Wife? Was it, to make my two Brothers your enemies? was it, to ruine my Country? was it, to ſee my friends and kindred carried away Captive into a ſtrange Country? Oh! What a ſad and fatall marriage was this unto me? Had it not been much better for me, that the firſt day the Towne was taken, had been the laſt of my life? Upon this, that wiſe and prudent Princeſſe fell down all tears at the feet of <hi>Ataulfus,</hi> and kiſſed them, with ſo many ſighes and groanes, as the Kings pitty did ſurmount the cruelty of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo as he took her up, kiſſed her, and ſaid unto her: Ceaſe ceaſe, all your tears and ſighes, my deareſt <hi>Placidia,</hi> I do freely give unto you, your City and Country; and to make it appear, how much I do deſire your contentment, I do vow and ſwear by the ſoul of my dead Father, that I will never turne my armes againſt any of your Brothers, whoſe friendſhip and amity, for your ſake, I will by all waies court.</p>
               <p>The King of the <hi>Gothes</hi> thus mollified and vanquiſhed, he concluded a Peace with <hi>Honorius,</hi> and went out of <hi>Italy</hi> into thoſe Provinces, which were agreed by <hi>Alarick</hi> his Predeceſſor, he ſhould have. But his people, who were of a martiall temper, and had lived many years in Armes, they could not endure to hear upon any tearmes of Peace; and therefore by a publick ſedition, did put him to death.</p>
               <p>Now was <hi>Placidia</hi> in no leſſe danger, then at the taking of <hi>Rome;</hi> for a popular tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult is like a torrent, that carries away all that will ſtop its fury; Yet, this wiſe Princeſſe, who foreſaw ſuch a danger long beforehand, ſhe obliged the prime Officers in the Army, by all the good offices that poſſibly ſhe could imagine; and indeed, as long as ſhe was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, ſhe was honoured and loved more then ever any Queen was.</p>
               <p>This generous ſpirit did not ſhrink from her zeal and love unto her Country and her Brothers, in the leaſt manner, by the death of her Husband; but, after ſhe had a while la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented her ſad miſhap, ſhe tranſacted the matter ſo, that a Grandee Prince amongſt the <hi>Gothes,</hi> of whoſe amity ſhe was well affored, was choſen King, his name was <hi>Segerick.</hi> This new King acknowledging his obligations unto <hi>Placidia,</hi> and thinking the amity of the Roman Emperours very neceſſary, for the eſtabliſhment of his Crowne, he ſhewed himſelfe ſo affectionate unto it and her, as he procured unto himſelfe the odium of the Army, who preſently after did murder him, as they had done before <hi>Ataulfus.</hi> But this generous Queen, who could never be daunted by any misfortue, nor weary with any
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:53526:198"/>
paines for the good and ſecurity of the Empire, ſhe brought it ſo to paſſe that <hi>Vulius</hi> was choſen King. This <hi>Vulius</hi> was a great and a wiſe Commander, who having before his eyes the example of two Kings his Predeceſſors, he reſolved by prudence to avoyd the like end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> At his firſt comming to his Crowne, therefore, he made a ſhew as if he were a profeſſed enemy unto the Empire, made great preparations againſt it, and faining to be farre out with the wiſe <hi>Placidia,</hi> he ſent to denounce warre againſt her Brother. Who being advertiſed underhand by his Siſter, he ſpread abroad reports of a puiſſant Army, which he would raiſe againſt the <hi>Goths,</hi> and ſo frighted theſe Barbarians by the aide of <hi>Vulius,</hi> that in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the people demanded peace; which was concluded to the great contentment of <hi>Placidia.</hi> Who now ſeeing the Empire ſetled, and ſecured on that ſide, deſired to be out of their hands, and went into <hi>Italy.</hi> Where ſhe was received by her Brother, and the people, as if ſhe had been a great Generall, unto whom the tryumph belonged. It ſeemes now fortune was wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of tormenting this wiſe Princeſs: And ſhe was ſo beloved and honoured by every one eſpecially <hi>Honorius</hi> himſelfe, as remembring the cares and paines ſhe had taken in deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Empire from the Tyrannique Arms of the <hi>Goths;</hi> and how much both he and all <hi>Europe</hi> was beholding to her: They reſolved ſeeing he had no Children, to marry her unto one whom he would allie unto the Empire, to the end ſhe might after him, be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe of thoſe Dominions, which ſhe had ſo long and ſo prudently preſerved.</p>
               <p>In order unto this deſigne he look't upon one of the greateſt Captaines in all the Armie, whoſe valour, and wiſe conduct did render him moſt worthy of a great command: his name was <hi>Conſtantius;</hi> a man of a very antlent Familiy, and high vertue: His Picture is next unto that of <hi>Placidia,</hi> in whoſe aſpect you may obſerve ſuch a grandure of ſpirit and corrage as is not commone. And indeed he was one of the greateſt Perſonages, that the Empire had a long time before. This was he, unto whom <hi>Honorius</hi> gave his Siſter: And at the ſame time ſent him into <hi>Spaine</hi> with a great Armie againſt the <hi>Almaines,</hi> the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and the <hi>Vandals.</hi> The good King <hi>Vulius,</hi> hearing that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band unto the wiſe <hi>Placidia,</hi> he aſſiſted him with all his forces, and followed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in perſon. This was the reaſon why <hi>Conſtantius</hi> at his returne gave <hi>Aquitaine</hi> unto the ſaid <hi>Vulius,</hi> where he lived quietly and in good coreſpondency with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This great <hi>Conſtantius</hi> got the better of the <hi>Almanes,</hi> killed their King called <hi>Acatius</hi> and afterwards vanquiſhed the <hi>Swedes.</hi> And doubtleſſe the <hi>Vandals</hi> had been driven out but for the revolt which <hi>Attalus</hi> had cauſed in <hi>Rome,</hi> intending to declare himſelfe Emperor, becauſe <hi>Honorius</hi> had no Children, nor had named any ſucceſſor For <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> leaving his Enterpriſe in <hi>Spaine</hi> unperfect, he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſeizing upon the rebell he confined himſelfe unto the <hi>Hippodrome:</hi> At which <hi>Honorius</hi> was ſo well pleaſed that he made him his aſſociate, and declared him <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> Fortune who commonly ſeconds one favour with another; did ſo by <hi>Conſtantius:</hi> So as now behold him a conquerer in <hi>Spaine,</hi> Tryumphant at <hi>Rome,</hi> and an Aſſociate in the <hi>Empire.</hi> One great favour more ſhe added unto all theſe which was not inferiour to any of the precedent: And gave him two children by his deareſt and ſo highly beloved <hi>Placidia,</hi> the one called <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian,</hi> and the other <hi>Honoriques</hi> of whom I have been very curious in getting their pict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures. This peece is <hi>Valentian's</hi> next unto <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> his wiſe; Daughter unto the Emperour <hi>Arcadius:</hi> And that peece is <hi>Honoriques</hi> next <hi>Attilia,</hi> who, after ſhe married him, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him into <hi>Pannonia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now behold <hi>Placidia</hi> and <hi>Conſtantius</hi> at the higheſt ſtep of their felicity. But it ſeems fortune had onely made truce with this wiſe Princeſſe, not a laſting peace. For when her husband had prepared a formidable army, to reduce <hi>Spaine</hi> entirely unto the Empire, he fell ſick of a violent diſeaſe, and a few dayes after dyed. All the comforts that this wiſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe now had, was in the lamentations and love of the whole Empire: And alſo in the two Children, which her husband had left her, whom ſhe educated with all poſſible care.</p>
               <p>There was at that time a very wiſe and valiant Captaine in the army whoſe name was <hi>Aetius,</hi> Sonne unto the great <hi>Gaudentius</hi> who was ſlaine in <hi>Gaule.</hi> I muſt needs confeſſe that I am very partiall towards him: for having made long warre in the neighbor Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we never received any harme by him, or his Army. But on the contrary, I have known him, ſo careful for our preſervation, that indeed all the <hi>Gaules</hi> are obliged unto him I was therefore very carefull in getting his Picture which I have placed next that of <hi>Attilia,</hi> becauſe it was he who held this ſcourge of god from the <hi>Gauls.</hi> Obſerve in his Aquiline
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:53526:199"/>
noſe his Generoſity: in his large forehead full of wrinkles, his Prudence: and his quick and ſparkling eyes, his Vigilance and Celerity. Indeed he was one of the moſt prudent, and moſt valiant men of his time: he could foreſee things, before there was any ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of appearance unto others; he was infinitly courteous: and ſo liberall, as in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Alexander</hi> he reſerved nothing to himſelfe but Hope. This was he who was made choice of, by <hi>Honorius</hi> to proſecute the Enterpriſe in <hi>Spaine,</hi> in whom the advice of <hi>Placi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> had a great ſtroake. But how miſerable is the man that lives by the opinion of others! for if he have no reputation, he is ſcorned: and if he have reputation, and do not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwere that opinion which men have of him, he is ſuſpected too light in the ballance. And the worſt is when he meets with ſuch as have no experience. It was the misfortune of this great perſon, who thinking to go into <hi>Spaine</hi> without any ſtay in <hi>Gaule,</hi> he was much deceived: For finding the <hi>Burgundians</hi> ready to ſeize upon the Country of the <hi>Heduois</hi> and <hi>Seguanois:</hi> and that the <hi>Frankes</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Pharamond</hi> their King had paſſed over the <hi>Rhine</hi> and would quarter in <hi>Gaule,</hi> he was forced by this at home, to make head againſt them, before he paſſed any further; which he did, ſo happily, that he ſent back the <hi>Burgundians</hi> to the place from whence they came; and forced back the <hi>Franks</hi> over the <hi>Rhine</hi> where they ſtayed: yet not without many dangerous skirmiſhes, as you may imagine. For the <hi>rankes,</hi> of all the Northerne people are the moſt hardy and warlick, and have a great conformitie with the <hi>Gaules,</hi> both in their Lawes, Policies, and Religion: which argues that formerly theywere all but one people and that the <hi>Franks</hi> originally were <hi>Gaules.</hi> But however, <hi>Pharamond</hi> went back over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and by the prudence and valour of <hi>Aetius</hi> was forced to ſtay there: Now though <hi>Aetius</hi> was victorious, yet was he ſo much weakned that when he paſſed into <hi>Spain,</hi> he found himſelfe weaker then thoſe he was to undertake, for the <hi>Vandals</hi> fortifying in the <hi>Betique,</hi> under the the conduct of <hi>Genſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> were growne very puiſſant. The <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Almaines</hi> entered into <hi>Meridea,</hi> and there quartered: And the <hi>Gothes</hi> after the Death of <hi>Vualius</hi> having loſt all good will unto the Romane Empire, and not contented nor contianing themſelves within their limits in <hi>Aquitaine;</hi> they enlarged them in <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo as what the <hi>Romans</hi> had, was the leaſt part: Which conſtrained this great Captaine, ſeeing his enemies ſtronger then himſelfe, to uſe prudence more then the ſword, and to make them enemies amongſt themſelves: ſo as he thought it moſt expedient to temporize with them till he eſpied his advantage, and to run no hazards in the meane time.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Aetius</hi> having already chaſed the <hi>Burgundians</hi> and the <hi>Franks</hi> away, <hi>Honorius</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that as ſoon as he was arrived in <hi>Spain,</hi> he ſhould preſently heare newes of the defeat of the <hi>Vandals, Swedes, Almaines;</hi> and <hi>Goths:</hi> And ſeeing the newes was long in comming, he ſuſpected him, and had an opinion that he was ſlack in his enterpriſes. This Prince was timerous and having never been in armes, he was ignorant in matters of warre: So as he knew nothing by ſight, but meaſured every thing by the happy ſucceſs of the great <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantius:</hi> In ſo much as miſtruſting <hi>Aetius,</hi> he called him back, and ſent <hi>Caſtinus</hi> in his roome.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Caſtinus</hi> was a great freind of <hi>Aetius:</hi> And therefore the affaires of the Empire went the better, becauſe <hi>Aetius</hi> gave him the beſt inſtructions that he could, opening unto him all their deſignes and the meanes to put them in execution. In the mean time he returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he gave an account of his actions unto <hi>Honorius.</hi> But finding that the Emperour had ſome jealouſie of him, he retired unto his owne houſe, and lived a private perſon afterwards: ſeeing theſe jealouſies did daily increaſe, and that they would queſtion him for his life, he was forced to ſave himſelfe in <hi>Pannonia</hi> amongſt the <hi>Hunnes</hi> and <hi>Gepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des;</hi> And it it was a very prudent conſideration which moved him to fly unto them rather then any other: For had he gone to the <hi>Franks, Burgundians, Gothes, Viſſigots</hi> or <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,</hi> It might have been ſaid that the Emperor had juſt cauſe to ſuſpect him, and that he had held a compliancy with them. But this could not be ſaid of the <hi>Hunnes</hi> and <hi>Gepides,</hi> becauſe they were ſcarcely knowne unto the Romane people. <hi>Placidia</hi> being extreamly angry with her Brother, as well for the loſſe of <hi>Aetius,</hi> as for the bad carriage of every thing elſe, ſhe reſolved to retire unto <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to her Nephew <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> whither ſhe had gone long before, had not <hi>Arcadius</hi> her Brother, lying upon his death bed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his Sonne <hi>Theodoſius</hi> unto the Protectorſhip of <hi>Iſdigerdes</hi> King of the <hi>Perſians:</hi> &amp; <hi>Parthians.</hi> For though he was his friend and confederate, yet the people had beene long ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Empire, and therefore ſhe did not like that any ſtrangers ſhould have the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her Nephew. Yet <hi>Iſdigerdes</hi> ſhewed himſelfe a very good man, in the buſineſſe:
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:53526:199"/>
And becauſe he could not go in perſon, he ſent a very great Captain unto <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to govern the perſon and the ſtate of this young Prince, who was then about eight years of age. The name of this Parthenian was <hi>Antiochus,</hi> a man who did acquit himſelfe ſo well of the charge committed unto him, as his adminiſtration was clear and blameleſſe. If you will turne your eye that way, you may ſee the Picture of <hi>Iſdigerdes,</hi> neer that of <hi>Arcadius;</hi> next him, is <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the ſecond; and next that, his wiſe and honeſt Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>Antiochus;</hi> you may perceive by his phyſiognomy, that he was a downright honeſt man, free from ambition. When <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was out of his Guardianſhip, <hi>Placidta</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to go unto him, and carry her Children with her. Now, this prudent Princeſſe being infinitely beloved, and the young <hi>Valentinian</hi> began to promiſe great hopes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, many Senators and Knights of <hi>Rome</hi> preferred their Sons unto his ſervice. <hi>Placidia</hi> was very glad, that ſhe could thus oblige the principall Senators of <hi>Rome</hi> unto her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, amongſt the reſt <hi>Urſaces,</hi> Son unto a prime Roman Knight; I do name him, becauſe he did revenge the death of <hi>Valentinian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Silvander</hi> then interrupting the Druide: I beſeech you, Father, pardon my interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; If you do mean that <hi>Urſaces,</hi> who killed <hi>Maximus,</hi> there is none in the Company can give you a more particular account of him, then my ſelfe; for, I being then at the <hi>Maſsilian</hi> Schoole<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> fortune, his Ship ran aſhore, where, I believe, both he and his friend <hi>Olimbres</hi> had dyed, but for the help which I and my Company gave him; and afterwards, ſtaying untill his ſhip was trimmed, he related unto me the particulars of his life, which was hard to be known from any but himſelfe.</p>
               <p>That is the very ſame (ſaid <hi>Adamas)</hi> of whom I ſpeak; and when you have heard out what I ſhall tell you concerning the fortune of this wiſe Princeſſe, I aſſure my ſelfe the Company will be very glad to hear a relation of <hi>Urſaces</hi> from you. But, to return from whence we left. Know, that whilſt <hi>Honorius</hi> lived in this manner <hi>Aetius</hi> lived in <hi>Pano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> but was not idle: for, Revenge being the ſweeteſt thoughts of an injured perſon, and being very ſenſible of the wrong <hi>Honorius</hi> had done him, he ſtudied how to make him repent the unjuſt uſage of him in this manner: And being a man, whoſe name and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was every where famous, he eaſily perſwaded theſe Barbarians unto what he would, repreſenting unto them, how eaſie a matter it was, to make attempts againſt <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, by means of that intelligence which he held there; and ſetting them a longing after their Riches and treaſures. This people, who deſired nothing more then changing their cold habitation, hearing of the fertility and riches in <hi>Italy,</hi> they burned with deſire to enter into it. When they had raiſed a vaſt number of men, and were ready to enter, it ſeemes, god had ſome pitty upon the Empire, and allaid this ſtorme by the death of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius. Aetius,</hi> wiſhing no ill unto <hi>Italy,</hi> but only unto <hi>Honorius,</hi> hearing newes of his death, did preſently change deſigne; and told the Barbarians, that it was neceſſary he ſhould go firſt unto <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſee how things ſtood, and what Forces they had. They preſently approved of what he ſaid, and promiſed him all poſſible reliefe and aſſiſtance. He returned therefore in confidence of <hi>Caſtinus</hi> his friendſhip, with a deſigne to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe Emperour; but finding the faction of <hi>Honorius</hi> to be very great, and ſtanding in fear of a great Captain, called <hi>Boniface,</hi> who had the command of the <hi>Affrican</hi> Forces, but much more of the young Emperour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> he thought it better to put it upon one <hi>John,</hi> who was the principall Secretary unto <hi>Honorius,</hi> with whom he ever had good correſpondency; therefore he made him to take the title of Emperor upon him, and under his name ordered and diſpoſed of all things: and certainly, he ſhewed a great deal of prudence in it; for, <hi>Theodoſius</hi> not approving of this <hi>John,</hi> declared <hi>Valentinian,</hi> his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen-german, the Emperour of the Weſt: And knowing, that the Sword was the beſt prop of the Scepter, he raiſed a very great Army, and ſent it into <hi>Italy,</hi> under the conduct of a very experienced Souldier, called <hi>Artabures;</hi> and this Souldier made his knowledge in martiall matters, very well appear unto <hi>Caſtinus:</hi> Yet, the Sea was ſo contrary to his deſignes, that a ſtorme caſt him upon the coaſt of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> the reſt of his Fleet was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed into ſeverall places: But <hi>Aſpar,</hi> the Son of <hi>Artabures,</hi> who accompanied his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this expedition, being by fortune not in the ſame ſhip: when the ſtorm was over and heard of his Fathers fortune, he rallied together all the Fleet that poſſibly he could, and landing in the night, entred <hi>Ravenna</hi> with all his Forces, through the negligence of the Guardes; and when day was come, he took <hi>John,</hi> cut off his head immediately, and delivered his Father.</p>
               <p>The wiſe <hi>Placidia</hi> came to <hi>Ravenna,</hi> with the young Emperour her Son, almoſt at
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:53526:200"/>
the ſame time; and within a few daies after, things ſucceeded as well as ſhe could wiſh: For, <hi>Caſtinus</hi> comming out of <hi>Spain,</hi> not knowing of this <hi>John</hi>'s accident, he thought to joyne his Forces with thoſe of his friend <hi>Aetius,</hi> and their Emperour, and to that end, made very long Marches; of which, <hi>Placidia</hi> being advertiſed, ſhe ſent <hi>Artabures</hi> to ſtop his way, who met him at <hi>Verceill,</hi> gave him Battle, defeated his Army, and brought him Priſoner to <hi>Ravenna.</hi> And, as if heaven would entirely ſettle the Empire upon <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian, Aetius,</hi> who was at <hi>Rome,</hi> expecting the Forces of <hi>Caſtinus,</hi> and alſo from the <hi>Hunnes</hi> and <hi>Gepides,</hi> he was taken Priſoner by the adherents unto the Faction of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius,</hi> who brought him to <hi>Ravenna</hi> unto <hi>Placidia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this occaſion, this great Princeſſe ſhewed her ſelfe, to be of a moſt generous and prudent ſpirit; for, in lieu of taking revenge upon theſe two great perſons, by putting them to death, ſhe thought, it would be a greater advantage unto <hi>Valentinian,</hi> if ſhe could make them his faithfull Servants. As for <hi>Caſtinus,</hi> ſhe did not much care for him, ſo as perhaps ſhe would have handled him more roughly, had it not been in conſideration of his friend <hi>Aetius,</hi> whoſe judgment, experience, and valour, ſhe knew, and thought would be very uſefull unto her Son, by reaſon of the great reputation he had with the <hi>Hunnes</hi> and <hi>Gepides,</hi> who, at his inſtigation, had made great preparations to enter into <hi>Italy,</hi> and were already upon their March. Moreover, ſhe conſidered that <hi>Honorius,</hi> by his ſuſpitions of him, had given him juſt occaſion to leave his ſervic<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> and therefore, to ſave himſelfe, he went amongſt thoſe Barbarians, whoſe Forces, ſhe feared, might infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely impede the event of her Son's Empire.</p>
               <p>All theſe things therefore well conſidered, ſhe thought that if ſhe did puniſh <hi>Caſtinus,</hi> ſhe ſhould extreamly offend <hi>Aetius,</hi> by reaſon of the amity betwixt them; and therefore, in keeping <hi>Caſtinus</hi> in ſafetie, ſhe conceived it would keep the other the more unto his duty, almoſt forcing him unto it, to ſave the life of his friend. In this reſolution, ſhe put <hi>Caſtinus</hi> a Priſoner into the <hi>Hippodrome,</hi> from whence a few daies after ſhe releaſed him, purpoſely to oblige <hi>Aetius</hi> the more, unto whom, in the mean time, ſhe gave liberty, and in lieu of puniſhment, conferred favours upon him, excuſing all he had done upon the ill grounded jealouſie of <hi>Honorius</hi> She procured <hi>Valentinian</hi> to ſend him generall into <hi>Gaul,</hi> againſt ſeverall Nations that poſſeſſed it. Before he went, in proof of his fidelity, he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted ſo with the <hi>Hunnes</hi> and <hi>Gepides,</hi> that when they had ſet foot in <hi>Italy,</hi> they returned back, and went into <hi>Pannonia.</hi> As ſoon as he came into <hi>Gaul,</hi> he raiſed the Siege of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilla,</hi> which <hi>Thierry,</hi> the Son of <hi>Vualius,</hi> the good friend unto the Empire, had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded, and relieved the place, when it was reduced unto great neceſſity. Afterwards, making head againſt the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> he driv them back unto the limits, unto which the Emperour had confined them. As for the <hi>Francks,</hi> though he could not at that time keep them from making ſome progreſſe under their King <hi>Clodion,</hi> yet, he kept them out of <hi>Gaul,</hi> ſo as they got nothing on that ſide the <hi>Rheine.</hi> And becauſe the <hi>Britaines</hi> were not able to reſiſt the <hi>Picts,</hi> though the <hi>Romans</hi> had made there a ſtrong Rampart, in form of a Wall to defend the <hi>Brittaines</hi> from the incurſions of their neighbour-people and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he ſent <hi>Galucon</hi> thither, with a Legion which was then in <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto all things went according to the wiſh of the wiſe <hi>Placidia,</hi> and the Emperour her Son: But <hi>Boniface</hi> was the firſt, who ruining himſelfe, made them be of the loſing hand, both in <hi>Affrica</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> This <hi>Boniface</hi> was Governour in <hi>Affrica,</hi> who was an inveterate hater of <hi>Caſtinus,</hi> and by conſequence of <hi>Aetius:</hi> He hearing how <hi>Placidia</hi> treated them, and of the great power ſhe had conferred upon <hi>Aetius,</hi> in making him a Patriarch, and in giving him the charge of all <hi>Gaul,</hi> he reſolved to withdraw himſelfe from under his obedience; and therefore not following his commands, he would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to order return to <hi>Rome.</hi> At which <hi>Placidia</hi> being offended, ſhe procured <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortius</hi> to be ſent thither with a great Army. Some had a ſuſpition, that this was the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice of <hi>Aetius,</hi> to ruine him in the opinion of <hi>Placidia</hi> and the Emperour. However it was, <hi>Mahortius</hi> being defeated by <hi>Boniface, Valentinian</hi> ſent <hi>Siſulphus</hi> thither, whoſe Picture you may ſee next that of <hi>Valentinian</hi> I was very deſirous to have it, as well for his valour and prudence, as for his conſtant fidelity unto his Maſter, conceiving that his excellent qualities, rendred him worthy to be placed amongſt ſo many illuſtrious perſons. This <hi>Siſulphus,</hi> at the firſt, ſeized upon <hi>Carthage,</hi> and forced <hi>Boniface</hi> to fly into <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritania,</hi> where finding no ſafety for himſelfe, he called in <hi>Genſerick,</hi> King of the <hi>Vandalls,</hi> who then was in the <hi>Betique.</hi> This <hi>Vandal</hi> was very glad to come out of <hi>Spain,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Goths,</hi> under <hi>Thierry</hi> their King, having not room enough for themſelves, did ſo
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:53526:200"/>
preſſe upon the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and tormented them, that they were not able to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. When <hi>Boniface</hi> offered <hi>Genſerick</hi> to ſhare <hi>Affrica</hi> with him, he was reduced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a paſſe, as he knew not which way to turn himſelfe; but he took that part which <hi>Boniface</hi> preſented unto him. He left the <hi>Betique,</hi> which was ever ſince called <hi>Vandaluſia,</hi> and went into <hi>Affrica</hi> with his Wife and Children; but he learned from <hi>Boniface,</hi> what it was to truſt unto <hi>Barbarians;</hi> for, as ſoon as he came unto <hi>Affrica,</hi> he ſeized upon <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and confined poor <hi>Boniface</hi> unto the inacceſſable Mountains; afterwards, he made his peace with the <hi>Romans,</hi> upon condition, he might keep what he had gotten from <hi>Boniface. Valentinian</hi> willingly conſented unto it; and thinking, that all the reſt of <hi>Affrica</hi> was ſecured unto him, by this new Peace made with this <hi>Vandal,</hi> he called the valiant <hi>Siſulphus</hi> from <hi>Carthage,</hi> to employ him in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Gaul.</hi> But <hi>Genſerick</hi> kept his word no better with him, then he had done with <hi>Boniface;</hi> for, <hi>Siſulphus</hi> was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in <hi>Italy</hi> with all his Forces, but the <hi>Vandal</hi> ſeized upon <hi>Carthage,</hi> and drove the <hi>Romans</hi> quite out of <hi>Affrica;</hi> ſo as this great City was ſeparated from the Empire, untill the valiant <hi>Scipio</hi> reduced it unto the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>At that time, there lived in an Affrican Towne called <hi>Iponne,</hi> a great and vertuous perſon named <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> a very friend unto <hi>Boniface</hi> and one that adored only one god; and though he did differ from the Religion that we profeſſe, yet was he much neerer it, then the antient <hi>Romans;</hi> for, he offered ſacrifices of Bread and Wine as we do, and would not upon any termes admit of any plurality of gods; but above all, he reverenced the Virgin who was to have a Child, unto whom we have for many ages dedicated an Altar in the Carnutan Monoſtarie. But to return unto our diſcourſe. It ſeemes, that at that time it pleaſed the great god to change the people of one Country into another, and to make great revolutions, eſpecially in <hi>Europe:</hi> For, the raigne of the <hi>Vandals</hi> begun to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in <hi>Affrica,</hi> the <hi>Viſigots</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi> for as ſoon as the <hi>Vandals</hi> were gone, they planted themſelves there. The <hi>Anglois</hi> ſeated themſelves in <hi>Brittain,</hi> becauſe <hi>Galicia</hi> being called away by the Emperour, to be ſent into <hi>Affrica,</hi> the <hi>Picts</hi> did ſo torment that Kingdome, that the <hi>Brittaines</hi> were forced to call the <hi>Anglois</hi> to their aid, who ever ſince rendred themſelves Maſters of it. The <hi>Francks,</hi> under <hi>Clodion</hi> and afterwards <hi>Merovius,</hi> did plant themſelves where now they are. Thus, wiſe ſhepheards, do the heavens when they pleaſe, make revolutions, changes, and alterations in Kingdomes and Dominions.</p>
               <p>Now the wiſe and prudent <hi>Placidia,</hi> being grown into great years, and having had great experience of fortune's variety, ſeeing her ſelfe unable to ſupport that great weight of affairs which ſhe foreſaw would fall upon <hi>Valentinian,</hi> ſhe did extreamly deſire to ſee him married, as it had been long before reſolved upon, unto the Daughter of her Nephew <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> who ever had the ſame intention. And things were ſo managed, that <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> went unto <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where the Marriage was ſolemnized, to the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment both of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Placidia;</hi> of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> becauſe his Daughter was to be an Empreſſe, which he moſt deſired; and of <hi>Placidia,</hi> becauſe ſhe conceived, this alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance would be a great ſtrength unto her Son againſt his enemies, and would oblige <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoſius</hi> to help him upon all occaſions, as he did, before her Son returned from <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople;</hi> for, he ſent with his Daughter <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> a great Army, to be employed which way ſoever <hi>Valentinian</hi> pleaſed.</p>
               <p>Thus, ſage ſhepheards, have I acquainted you with the life of her, who has run through variety of fortunes, ſo as it may be ſaid, that <hi>Placidia</hi> was all her time the very Butt, both of good and bad fortune: For, ſhe had been Daughter, Siſter, Wife, Mother, and Aunt unto Emperours; and ſhe had been taken Captive by Barbarians, and lived, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the death of moſt of thoſe, whom ſhe moſt loved. However, we may conclude her happy, ſince ſhe dyed at <hi>Rome,</hi> a Mother unto an Emperour, who loved and honoured her, and infinitely lamented throughout all the Empire; for ſhe dyed, preſently after her Son was returned into <hi>Italy</hi> with his Wife.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Adamas</hi> ended his <hi>diſcourſe,</hi> which cauſed all the company to fix their eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Picture of this great Princeſſe, conſidering every lineament of her face, and admiring her vertue. But <hi>Alexis</hi> remembring what <hi>Silvander</hi> had ſaid, concerning the fair <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe,</hi> and deſirous to know, whether he had heard a relation of the ſtory, as ſhe had, from the mouth of <hi>Urſaces,</hi> which ſhe had begun to relate unto <hi>Leonida,</hi> when <hi>Adamas</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted them, ſhe deſired that Nymph in a low voice, to put <hi>Silvander</hi> in minde of his promiſe. But it was ſo late, that <hi>Adamas</hi> would not ſuffer the old ſhepheards to go away
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:53526:201"/>
untill the next morning. <hi>Leonida</hi> deſiring to pleaſe <hi>Alexis</hi> in all things poſſible, and very deſirous alſo to hear the ſtory of <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> ſhe ſummoned him to the performance of his promiſe. He offering to excuſe himſelfe, becauſe it was late, <hi>Adamas</hi> anſwered, that this ſhould be no excuſe for him for he would not ſuffer them to go away that night. <hi>Diamis, Phocion,</hi> and <hi>Tircis,</hi> made ſome dorre at it; but <hi>Hylas</hi> was very forward to accept of his invitation, ſaying, Let thoſe that will go, go, and thoſe that will ſtay, ſtay; for his part, he was all for the ſtayers, and would with all his heart ſtay, as long as <hi>Alexis</hi> was there.
<hi>Adamas</hi> ſmiled at this and after thanks, he ſo intreated all the reſt, that it was impoſſible they ſhould deny him, therefore all ſitting down, <hi>Silvander</hi> began thus</p>
               <p>Since it is your deſire, ſage <hi>Adamas,</hi> and you, great Nymph, that I ſhould relate the fortune of the fair <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> be pleaſed to give leave, that I tell you, how I came to know it, and from whom I heard it, to the end, you may give the more credit unto the relation. Now, though you ſee me in a ſhepheards habit, and though I have long had the charge of a little Flock, where theſe ſage ſhepheards do dwell; yet for all that, I am not this Country-man, nor was I brought up a ſhepheard; but on the contrary, ſuch indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent care was had of my education, that to render me the better accompliſhed, I was brought up in the beſt Exerciſes and Arts, that Youth could be employed in; ſo as if I did not much benefit my ſelfe and my underſtanding, it was long only of my dull capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. To this end therefore, I was ſent unto the <hi>Phocenſian</hi> and <hi>Maſsilian</hi> Schooles, where I ſpent much time in ſtudy; and there being much good company, we uſed many exerciſes for recreations ſake, in the intervalls of our ſtudies; ſometimes we ſhould go upon the Sea, ſometimes play upon the Lute, ſometimes Run, Leap, and Pitch the Bar, or ſome other recreation to keep us from idleneſſe, which is the ruſt of Life and Mother of all Vice.</p>
               <p>It hapned in Summer time, that five or ſix of us in company, after we had wearied our ſelves with the Book, we went to bathe our ſelves; and to that end, went out of the Towne towards <hi>Liguria,</hi> unto the point of a Rock, which ſhot it ſelfe into the Sea, from whence we were accuſtomed to leap with head formoſt into the water, and ſhould oft times touch the bottome with our hands. At this time, being upon this Rock, and undreſſing our ſelves, we were prevented by a ſudden ſtorm of Wind and Rain, which was preſently ſeconded with Lightning and Thunder; the heavens grew immediately of a dusky colour, and the waves began to riſe ſo high, that we were hardly ſafe upon the top of this high Rock, with ſuch fury and violence did the waves daſh againſt it. It was terrible to ſee, how ſuddenly the day was turned into night, to hear the ſtrange roaring of the Sea, and to conſider the Chaos and hideous confuſion of this raging Element; and certainly, this bluſtering ſtorme had forced us away, if ſome good Genius had not ſtayed us: We did imagine, that many ſhips would ſuffer much dammage by it; and becauſe the winde did blow towards us, we reſolved to ſtay till the ſtorme was over, to ſee, if by fortune we could be helpfull unto any Sea-beaten paſſengers, but, to ſhelter us a little from the rain and winde, we crept into a little corner of the Rock, where we were wont to hide our clothes when we bathed our ſelves. The ſtorme had laſted above two houres, when we begun all to be weary; and when we were upon the point of going away, the sky be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to cleer up, and it left raining. Then we came out of our Rock, and going up to the top of it, we began to look, whether we could diſcover any thing upon the Sea. The winde wafted away all the cloudes, and the Sun began to ſhine; yet, the waves ceuſed not, becauſe the winde continued ſtill as great and high, as any time before. As we were diſcourſing amongſt our ſelves, upon the boldneſſe of Marriners, eſpecially of him that firſt adventured to Sea, how terrible the enraged Sea was, and that a wiſe man would never truſt himſelfe with it, one of our company, who was more obſervant of the Sea, then of our diſcourſe: Hold, (ſaid he) me-thinks I ſee a ſhip. Upon this, we aroſe, to ſee whether what he ſaid was true. At the firſt, none but himſelfe could ſee any thing; but preſently after, ſomething might be diſcerned: The winde was ſo high, that it wafted theſe ſhips preſently neerer us, and then every one plainly diſcerned them. There was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sailes, nor Maſt nor Tackling to be ſeen, the ſtorm had conſtrained the Marriners to take them all downe, and nothing made uſe of but the Rudder, which was ſcarcely able to reſiſt the Tempeſt. The ſight was very pittifull, for the winde was ſo high, as they could not keep themſelves from juſtling one againſt the other. The cries of thoſe that were within, which the winde wafted unto us, was lamentable to hear; they were all on the Deck, upon their knees, holding up their hands to heaven: Moſt of them, ſeeing the ſhore,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:53526:201"/>
were undreſt, hoping, if the ſhip came any neerer, to ſave themſelves by ſwimming. As for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was, a boyſterous wave daſhed them againſt our Rock; the great ruſh which the firſt gave againſt it, made it recoil back with ſuch a violence, as meeting with another which followed it, it broke a great part of the Poop and Prow of the other; and when the Sea was ready to ſwallow them up, another wave came, which daſhed them with ſo great a force againſt the ſame Rock, as the ſhips were quite overwhelmed: Oh god, what a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable ſpectacle was this! Some laid hold upon the points of the Rock, and ſtrove to get footing, till ſome help came; others ſeized upon the roots, which grew in the Rock, and ſo hung by the armes; and ſome, who had laid hold of ſuch roots, they breaking both fell into the Sea, till the waves brought them back; ſome got upon boards and poles, and ſuch like, but moſt were drowned. That which moved moſt compaſſion, was to ſee ſome women, who had no other help for themſelves, but their cries. I muſt confeſſe, this moved me ſo much, as being halfe undreſt, I haſted to ſtrip my ſelfe naked; and though the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was great, by reaſon of the windes and waves, I would do that to relieve them, which I had often done for my pleaſure, I leaped from the Rock into the Sea; and being in the water, I ſaw two women embracing each other, ready to ſinke; I took one by the hair, and ſwimming with my other hand, I drew them both aſhore, where leaving them halfe dead, I went again into the water, to help two men, whoſe amity moved me to compaſſion; for one of them, who could ſwim, had got the other upon his back to ſave him; but his load was ſo heavy, or elſe he that was upmoſt, who was younger then the other, did hang ſo about the neck of his friend, for fear of drowning, as he having neither ſtrength nor breath left, had already ſunk two or three times into the water: I took him that could not ſwim by one hand, ſo as eaſing the other, he took heart, ſo as we got to ſhore. All my Companions, after my example, did the like, ſo as we ſaved many of them. And becauſe I thought the gods commanded me to have a particular care of thoſe, whom I had ſaved from ſhipwrack, after I had put on my clothes, I went unto them, and aſſiſted them all that poſſibly I could; after I had gotten ſome of the water which they had ſwallowed, from them, they began to be reaſonable well, eſpecially the women, who had been in moſt danger. They thought themſelves ſo obliged to us, that they deſired to know our names, and of what Country we were; and when they heard me ſay, that I thought my ſelfe either a <hi>Seguſian</hi> or a <hi>Foreſtian:</hi> Oh god, (ſaid one of them) the men of ſuch a Country, as one of them, are deſtined to recall us from death. I asked them, why they ſaid ſo, ſeeing it was not a fit time for it, ſince they were ſo amazed with the ſhipwrack, that they were ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly able to breathe, nor do any thing, but hold up their hands, and lift up their eyes, in admiration of their miraculous eſcape: And becauſe they were almoſt all naked, I thought it fit, before I carried them to the Town, to get them ſome clothes to cover them, for it had not been decent to have carryed them otherwiſe. I went unto the Town, and met with ſo many perſons, who being very compaſſionate, relieved me with cloths for them, as I had relieved them with life; and when I brought them to the Town, they were quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in ſuch Bourghers houſes, as uſed to have compaſſion upon men in the like caſe. For my part, I defired thoſe two whom I had ſaved, to go with me, becauſed they ſeemed to be men of merit. We cannot part, ſaid they, from theſe two women whom you have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, both becauſe they are committed unto our charge, and becauſe perhaps it would be inconvenient for you. Not at all, (ſaid I unto them) ſo you will be contented with the littleneſſe of your lodgings; but it would rather be a great ſatisfaction unto me, if you would do me the favour. So they all foure followed me. And becauſe I had a friend in the Town, who had better lodgings then my ſelfe, I carried them unto the houſe of a rich Townſman with whom I had familiar intimacy, knowing his liberality and pitty to be ſuch, as he would bid ſuch men in ſuch a condition very civilly welcome; and ſo he did, for he did accommodate them with all things neceſſary. Now you muſt know, that theſe men whom I had thus ſaved, were two principall men in <hi>Rome,</hi> the name of the one was <hi>Urſaces,</hi> and of the other
<hi>Olimbres;</hi> ſo as they ſent preſently to their houſes, and furniſhed themſelves with mony and many ſervants. But, in ſatisfaction of my promiſe, be pleaſed to know, that whilſt they expected a return from <hi>Rome,</hi> theſe two Cavaliers would not be without me; ſo as quitting my ſtudy, I accompanyed them unto all ſuch places, unto which their curioſity invited them, in which I took much delight, for their converſation was very ſweet and pleaſing. At the laſt, deſiring much to know who they were, unto whom I had done ſo good an office, one night, when I was alone with them in their Chamber, (for the two women commonly retired, as ſoon as ſupper was done) I entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:53526:202"/>
them to tell me, why they ſhould ſay, when they heard I was a <hi>Seguſian,</hi> that thoſe of that Country were deſtined to ſave them from death? Unto which, the elder of them thus replyed.</p>

                  <hi>The Hiſtory of</hi> Eudoxe, Valentinian, <hi>and</hi> Urſaces.</head>
               <p>COurteous <hi>Silvander,</hi> (ſaid one of them, for he heard I was ſo called) your deſire is moſt juſt, and I am obliged to give you ſatisfaction; it is all the reaſon in the world you ſhould know the lives of them, whom you have ſaved, and the conditions of ſuch, as are ſo much obliged to you. Nor had we deferred it ſo long, had we not been in ſome fears, that if we were known, we might receive ſome diſpleaſure from ſome ſecret ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And therefore we intreat you to be cloſe, and take no notice of us, leſt all the pains you have taken in ſaving our lives, ſhould be loſt; alſo, leſt any ſhould hear us, I beſeech you ſhut cloſe the dore. Which being done, we all ſat down, and he began thus.</p>
               <p>Know, that <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> Son unto the Emperour <hi>Arcadius,</hi> and Granchild unto the great <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> being Emperour of the Weſt, he married <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ontinus,</hi> an <hi>Athenian</hi> Philoſopher. Although this Ladies extraction was not ſo illuſtrious, as equalized the Majeſty of an Emperour, yet, ſuch was both her beauty and vertue, as ſhe deſerved to be raiſed unto the higheſt degree of honour amongſt men. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> had but one Daughter by her: and becauſe he did moſt paſſionately love his Wife, he called his Daughter after her name, ſo her name was <hi>Eudoxe;</hi> and as if beauty and all excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies were fatall unto that name, this young Princeſſe in the very budding of her years, did appear ſuch a beauty, as ſhe excelled her Mother; and every one confeſſed, that nature had made her ſo perfectly fair, as it was impoſſible, any higher degrees of it could be added unto her. At this time, <hi>Placidia</hi> being but ill ſatisfied with her Brother <hi>Honorius,</hi> ſhe went unto <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to her Nephew <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> for ſhe was Daughter unto <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoſius</hi> the great, and Siſter unto <hi>Arcadius.</hi> She carried along with her <hi>Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Honorique,</hi> her two Children. I was at that time preferred very young unto <hi>Placidia,</hi> to be brought up with her Sons, as many other of the Roman Senators Children of my age were; and when ſhe left <hi>Italy,</hi> there was ſo great affection between <hi>Valentinian</hi> and me, that the one could not be without the other.</p>
               <p>The Emperour <hi>Theodoſius</hi> ſeeing his Uncle <hi>Honorius</hi> had no Children, he reſolved to beſtow his Daughter upon <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and to make him Emperour of the Weſt, after the death of <hi>Honorius.</hi> The wiſe <hi>Placidia,</hi> who ſaw this Match would be advantagious to her Son, ſhe commanded him to apply himſelfe as much as he could unto this Princeſſe. But ſee what conſtraint in love produceth! <hi>Valentinian</hi> could never love her, though ſhe was the faireſt Princeſſe in the world: yet, becauſe he would not diſpleaſe <hi>Placidia,</hi> nor his Coſen-german, upon whom all his fortunes depended, he diſſembled the matter ſo, that every one thought him really in love with her.</p>
               <p>I being brought up with this young Princeſs, I muſt confeſſe, that I did very inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately caſt my eye upon her, and fell ſo fatally in love, as it was impoſſible for me to make a retreat. Should I ſay the ſight of her was a happineſſe unto me, that hath coſt me ſo much ſorrow and pain? But why ſhould I make any doubt in the queſtion, ſince not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all my paines and ſorrowes, never was man more happy in ſuch a generous deſigne, then my ſelfe? So then, I became a ſervant unto this Princeſſe. And there being then Tournements held in the <hi>Hippodrome,</hi> at which <hi>Eudoxe</hi> was preſent as <hi>Valentinian</hi> entred the Liſts, under the notion &amp; name of the fair <hi>Eudoxe's</hi> Cavalier, it may wel beſaid, I did the ſame, being ſo captivated with her beauty and vertue, that never man was more. At the ſame time there was a young Lady, of the beſt Families in all <hi>Greece,</hi> preferred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the young <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> to be brought up with her, her name was <hi>Iſedore,</hi> and it muſt needs be confeſt, that there was none in all the Court (alwaies excepting <hi>Eudoxe)</hi> which was comparable unto her. <hi>Valentinian</hi> no ſooner caſt his eye upon her, but he fell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently in love with her: But, ſhe was ſo charie of her honour and reputation, as knowing, that <hi>Valentinian</hi> could not marry her, ſhe would not allow of his addreſſe, but at the firſt, did refuſe it in as milde a manner as ſhe could; but afterwards, did reject it in a more harſh manner, then perhaps the quality of <hi>Valentinian</hi> deſerved: And though he was very hot in purſuance of his affection, yet did ſhe behave her ſelfe ſo, as ſhe forced him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat in appearance, becauſe ſhe vowed, that if he continued, ſhe would acquaint <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoſius</hi>
                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:53526:202"/>
and <hi>Placidia</hi> with it. This young Prince fearing to diſpleaſe the Emperour and his Mother, did ſo conceal his deſires, as none could ſee them, except <hi>Eudoxe</hi> and my ſelfe. In the mean time, my affection ſtill encreaſed, though this young Princeſſe did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. The priviledge of my youth permitted me to ſee her when I pleaſed, without ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, and I was ſo perpetually aſſiduous and diligent about her perſon, as ſhe employed me ofter, then any other of my Companions. And though at that time I hardly knew what Love was, yet I took ſuch infinite delight in being neer her, in receiving her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, ſerving her, and ſometimes kiſſing the thing which ſhe gave unto me, as ſhe did attribute it unto my civility. I remember, one day as ſhe was walking in a Gallerie, where there was abundance of rare Pictures, there was amongſt the reſt, that of <hi>Icarus,</hi> whoſe wings failing, fell into the Sea <hi>Urſaces,</hi> (ſaid ſhe unto me) what does theſe ſcattered feathers, and this man falling into the Sea, ſignifie? Madam, (ſaid I unto her) he was a young man, who being inflamed with a generous courage, would not he contented to flie ſo low as his Father, whom you ſee by him; and becauſe his wings were ſet on with wax, the heat of the Sun melted them, ſo as he was forced to fall, as you ſee him. Truly, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe, he was very raſh and inconſiderate. However, replyed I, he was of a moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and noble ſpirit To what purpoſe, ſaid ſhe ſince it brought him to his death. Death, (anſwered I) is very welcome, when it leaves a brave memory behinde it. What! ſaid ſhe unto me, do you commend his act? I do ſo much commend it, Madam, ſaid I, as I would not refuſe to die, upon conditions of the like glory. This Princeſſe was at this time about ſome twelve years of age, and I about fifteen or ſixteen; an age, yet hardly capable of Love's reſentments, and yet I was not abſolutely free; however, I had not ſo much bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as to diſcover any thing unto her. I perceive, ſaid ſhe, that you do eſteem your life but very little. Doubtleſſe, Madam, (ſaid I unto her) there are many things which I do eſteem much more. What! ſaid ſhe, for when we are once dead, all that we leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde us concernes us not. Honour and Love, anſwered I. What is this honour, ſaid ſhe unto me? It is an opinion, replyed I, which we do leave of our ſelves, and of our courage; and Love, is a deſire to enjoy ſomething, that is great and noble; and therefore, Madam, I ſhould not refuſe to die in any generous acts or in doing you ſervice; firſt, for the glory I ſhould have by it; and ſecondly, for my affection unto you. How, (ſaid ſhe, Unto me? like a very childe) have you any love to me? How do you know it? By the effects, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered I; for, when I am out of your ſight I burn till I ſee you again; and when I do ſee you, I am vexed that I ſhall not ſee you long enough. How did you come by this diſeaſe, (ſaid ſhe unto me) and what is the cauſe of it? Your perfections, Madam, (ſaid I unto her) and your beauty, hath cauſed this diſeaſe, by ſtaying long with you. Were I as you (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe) I would ſtay as little as poſſible could be: but, is there no remedy for the cure of this diſeaſe? Yes, (ſaid I unto her) if you pleaſe to love me as well as I love you. How! (ſaid ſhe preſently) would you have me burn when I ſee you not? Good <hi>Urſaces,</hi> look for ſome other Receipt, for, believe it you ſhall not have this. I remember, that when I have burned my finger, I was in ſo much pain, as I will hardly undergo ſo much again for your cure. I durſt not reply, becauſe there were many Ladies and Knights talking together in the Gallery, and took no notice of us, though they were there to accompany the young Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe; but her childhood, and my youth, permitted me to be with her without ſuſpition.</p>
               <p>But afterwards, ſhe grew more knowing, and I grew more in love then before: <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian,</hi> whoſe whole deſigne was upon the fair <hi>Iſidore,</hi> did hold Tournements as oft as he could; for, having a good agility in that exerciſe, he thought by that means, to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate himſelfe into the favour of that wiſe Lady, ſtill ſeeming, as if all he did was for <hi>Eudoxe.</hi> Now, becauſe he commonly took ſuch as were of his own age, and there being not above two years difference betwixt him and me, I was alwaies of his party. Fortune it ſeemes had a minde to favour me, and conferred the Prize very often upon me, which ſeeming as if it were in behalfe of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> I alwaies carried unto <hi>Eudoxe;</hi> and when ſhe received it, ſhe permitted me to kiſſe her hand Oh, how well did I think all my pains beſtowed? Yet, I carried the matter with ſo much diſcretion, as ſhe could not poſſibly be offended, although ſhe did ſometimes remember the diſcourſe which I had formerly with her; for, conceiving them to be but imprudencies of Infancy, ſhe paſſed by them, thinking that age would better inſtruct me in my duty. The firſt time that ſhe ſuſpected the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, was, one day when ſhe was walking in the Emperours Garden; after ſhe had weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelfe with walking, ſhe ſet her ſelfe down in the ſhade, and fell aſleep in the lap of <hi>Iſidore.</hi> There was a great knot of young Cavaliers diſcourſing together, not far off the
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:53526:203"/>
Arbor where ſhe ſlept, when a Bee, did reſt it ſelfe upon her faire lippe, and after it had ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it a while, it did ſting it very much. The paine cauſed her to ſtart up, and laying her hand upon her paine, ſhe complained againſt <hi>Iſidore</hi> for the little care which ſhe had off her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Valentinian</hi> who was walking in the Garden, hearing her cry, and when he was come, ſeeing her chide <hi>Iſidore,</hi> he told her, that I had a receipt that would preſently cure her, and that he had ſeene the experience of it upon many, and particularly upon my ſelfe within this two dayes. What will he do? ſaid ſhe unto him, he will ſpeake ſome certaine words (anſwered <hi>Valentinian)</hi> upon the place which is pained, and the paine will imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly ceaſe: Then ſhe asked me, whether it was true, and I anſwered, yes, and that it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſed to faile me, nor did I think fortune would be leſſe favourable to me in curing her, then ſhe hath been in curing others: It vexed her extreamly that I ſhould bring my mouth ſo neere hers, and giving me her hand, ſhe commanded me to try upon it. But I drew my mouth neerer her lippe, and touched it; ſhe took away her hand and pulled back her head, telling me that this was a kiſſe and not a receipt, and would not permit me to uſe it; but the raine did ſo much increaſe, as it forced her to bid me teach it unto <hi>Iſidore,</hi> and ſhe ſhould uſe the charme upon her lip: This was much againſt my will; for I did extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly long to have the celeſtiall happineſſe of kiſſing her lip, though I was very ſorry for the paine ſhe endured. Love did adviſe me to teach other words unto <hi>Iſidore,</hi> to the end that finding no eaſe by them, ſhe might have recourſe unto me: My deſigne did take according to my wiſh; for ſhe muttering a few groſſe idle words which I taught her and uſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ceremonies, the paine ceaſed not. At which <hi>Valentinian</hi> laughing, Do you think Miſtreſſe (ſaid he) that any one can adminiſter this receit? For my part, I profeſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, I have tryed it, and I found a preſent eaſe? Now if it do you no good it is becauſe <hi>Iſidore</hi> hath omitted ſomething: Upon this going out of the Arbor, he returned againe, and brought in with him all the young Cavaliers. Her pain did exceedingly encreaſe, and her lip began to ſwell, when ſhe turning towards me, Will you ſay upon your faith, <hi>Urſaces,</hi> (ſaid ſhe) that the receit is good? I do ſweare unto you Madam (ſaid I unto her) by that honour which I owe you, that I never knew it faile, and I am ſorry <hi>Iſidore</hi> knowes not how to do it aright: but I wiſh I were for this once a woman, that I might do you this ſervice. I know not, Madam, ſaid <hi>Iſidore,</hi> why you ſhould be ſo ſcrupulous but I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that if you did ſee how your mouth is ſwelled, you would uſe any remedy to help it. But pray tell me, <hi>Urſaces,</hi> replyed <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> will you be long in applying your receipt? As little a time as I can Madam, anſwered I. Then going to her, ſhe went into the moſt obſcure part of the Arbor as being aſhamed to be ſeene, and the exceſſive pain forced her to let me uſe my Enchantment.</p>
               <p>Was ever any Sorcerer ſo happy as my ſelfe? I ſpoke the words upon her lippe: but when I tooke hers, between mine, and as I ſucked it did preſſe it a little; certainly if ever any did dye of delight it would have been <hi>Urſaces.</hi> She went away from me and bluſhed for ſhame; This (ſaid ſhe) is the ſtrangeſt receipt that ever was: But Madam (ſaid <hi>Iſidore)</hi> Do you finde any amendment? Me thinkes, anſwered ſhe, that I do. Your paine Madam (ſaid I unto her) will preſently be gone; but I ſhall have it all my ſelfe. How <hi>Urſaces</hi> (ſaid ſhe), muſt you have it all your ſelfe? yes Madam (anſwered I) the condition of this receipt is ſuch, that he who cures, muſt have the paine: ſhe who did not underſtand it, or at leaſt ſeemed ſo; Truly <hi>Urſaces</hi> (ſaid ſhe) I am very much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged unto you, for taking my pain upon you. Madam, anſwered I, could I as well take upon me all the paine that ever hereafter you ſhall endure, be confident, it ſhould never trouble you. <hi>Iſidore</hi> ſmiled and ſaid, Madam if you have as much good will unto him, as he has unto you, you muſt preſently cure him of his paine, as he hath yours. I had rather, in this be beholding unto him (anſwered ſhe) than he unto me; and I am ſure he is ſo civill and courteous, that he will not now give me that paine againe which he hath taken from me: Moſt true Madam (ſaid I unto her) but I muſt tell you my paine is not ſo much in my lippe as my heart. She underſtood my meaning very well, though ſhe ſeemed not to heare me, and had not <hi>Iſidore</hi> beene preſent, I had talked more unto her.</p>
               <p>I ſhould be too tedious <hi>(Silvander)</hi> ſhould I relate the whole Series of my affection, from the beginning; I ſhall therefore tell you onely what is neceſſary for you to know, and omit the reſt. Love did at the laſt render me ſo hardy, as I reſolved to declare unto her the reſentments of my ſoul: yet I was long in diſpute with my ſelfe whether it ſhould be by Letter or by word of mouth: at laſt I concluded it better to uſe my tongue then pen, having long ſince learned, that to write where one may ſpeake, argues too much feare,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:53526:203"/>
and thoſe who aske any thing fearefully, do teach how to deny: beſides, I ſaw there was much difficulty in the conveying of Letters unto her: But, Oh heavens, how oft did I turne back againe, after I was gone out of my lodging with this reſolution? But heaven at the laſt favoured my deſigne, and afforded me an opportunity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eudoxe</hi> uſed very often to frequent the Emperors Gardens: And I was alwayes very offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious &amp; ready to be imployed in her ſervice; though it were but to gather her a flower in a day, I was well centented with it and having long ſince learned that love does as often begin by trifles as by things of greater importance which very ſeldomfall out, &amp; that thoſe ſervices which oblige much, doe rather produce emnity then love, but that nothing winnes more upon another then affection; therefore I was very aſſiduous in ſerving her upon every triviall occaſion. Not one of her ſervants was ſo officious as my ſelfe. It happened one day, that <hi>Valentinian</hi> followed her, for <hi>Iſidores</hi> ſake, into the Garden; and <hi>Iſidore</hi> being a little weary, they ſeperated: <hi>Eudoxe</hi> continued walking, and <hi>Iſidore</hi> went into an Arbour, where ſhe found ſeates of graſſe, covered over with boughes: ſhe had not beene there long but <hi>Valentinian</hi> who was walking with <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> began to complaine of wearineſſe, and made that his pretence for going to ſit downe in the ſame Arbour: <hi>Iſidore</hi> offered to go out, but he held her by the gowne: <hi>Eudoxe</hi> ſeeing this, looked upon me and could not chuſe but ſmile: I thinking this to be a fit opportunitie to put my intended reſolution into execution, I would not let it ſlippe. I ſmiled therefore as well as ſhe, and ſhe asked me why I did ſo; to which I anſwered very freely that it was becauſe <hi>Valentinian</hi> had left her to go unto <hi>Iſidore.</hi> And why, <hi>Urſaces,</hi> (ſaid ſhe unto me) do not you the ſame? I Madam (ſaid I unto her) do you think I have ſo little judgement? Me thinkes (ſaid ſhe) that you ought to do it, becauſe it is fitter that you ſhould do her ſervice then <hi>Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> I know very well Madam (ſaid I) that there is much more equality betwixt <hi>Iſidore</hi> and me, then betwixt <hi>Valentinian</hi> and her, but I muſt needs confeſſe that I had rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a fault contrary unto that of <hi>Valentinian.</hi> How do you meane? (ſaid ſhe) I meane Madam (ſaid I) that rather then ſerve one who is equall unto my ſelfe as <hi>Iſidore</hi> is, I would dye for the love of one who is above me as you are: How me? anſwered ſhe, do you <hi>Urſaces,</hi> know what you ſay? I ſay Madam (anſwered I) that I had rather dye adoring You, then live and love <hi>Iſidore:</hi> and that the vaſt inequality betwixt us could never put me out of this mind ſince the firſt day I had the glory to ſee you. Surely (ſaid the Princeſſe) you are out of your wits, otherwiſe you would never talke thus to Me. Do not thinke ſo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam (ſaid I unto her) for I am ſure I never ſpoke more truly, nor with a ſounder judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. She ſtood ſtill and looked ſtedfaſtly upon me, and afterwards ſaid, Is this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>Urſaces,</hi> in earneſt or in jeaſt? I do ſweare Madam (ſaid I unto her) by that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which I owe you, that I did never in my life utter words more unfainedly, nor with a more reſolved will then theſe; and take them as you will, hate or treat me as you pleaſe, I ſhall never change.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Urſaces,</hi> (ſaid ſhe unto me) I am very ſorry for your folly: I have eſteemed you and your ſervice above any that have been educated under the Emperor my Father: But ſince you are growne ſo beyond all bounds of reaſon impudent, and quite forgot your duty and diſtance, be aſſured, that if ever you uſe the ſame liberty of language againe to me, I will make you repent of your raſhneſſe, and acquaint both <hi>Valentinian</hi> and the Emperor with it. Madam (anſwered I) did I not feare that thoſe who are in the garden would obſerve me, I would aske pardon upon my knees for my preſumptuous crime: but I beſeech you give me leave to ſay, that all your menaces cannot prevaile with my will: this affection is rivetted into it, heaven and earth cannot diſſolve it: and therefore there is no hope that any feare of the Emperor, or any conſideration of <hi>Valentinian</hi> can divert me. 'Tis true, I may be ſilent, and languiſh away for the love of the faire <hi>Eudoxe:</hi> and ſo I beleive I ſhall. Now for a proofe of this and not to offend you any longer with my impertinent talke, I do ſweare unto you by that eternall humble ſervice which I owe you, that I will never ſpeak to you of it againe. But remember this, that as oft as I do you any reverence, or bid you good morrow, my heart then ſayes unto you Madam, that <hi>Urſaces</hi> is dying for the love of you, and tacitly tells you that you will never have a more faithfull ſervant then he: And when I take my leave of you, or bid you good night, then do I ſay, how long is it your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure I ſhall be miſerable? and how long will your rigour laſt? And to begin (ſaid I ſadly to her) permit me to take my leave of you and bid you good night. Upon this I made a low reverence and retired, leſt I ſhould too much offend her with my words: but as I went, I obſerved that ſhe turned the other way and ſmiled; which gave my heart no little hope.
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:53526:204"/>
Thus, kind ſtranger, have I lived ever ſince with her, never making any ſemblance of what was paſt except by my good morrowes and good nights; which when none could ſee her, ſhe would often anſwere with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ake of her head, as if ſhe were ſtill offended at the memory of that which I hinted unto her. Above ſixe Months paſſed on this manner, and all the while ſhe ſhewed not the leaſt kind of any reception of my affection. At the laſt I vanquiſhed: one morning when <hi>Valentinian</hi> was leading her to the Temple, I went to her, and making an humble reverence I ſaid, good morrow Madam. At which ſhe ſmiled, and turning towards me; <hi>Urſaces,</hi> (ſaid ſhe) your good morrowes are very kindly accepted. Oh heavens? how can I expreſſe my joyes? I proteſt I never hoped for any happineſſe, eſpecially when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was talked of but the mariage of <hi>Valentinian</hi> and her. Yet I underſtood ſince, how that, which I believed would have ruined my hopes, was that which obliged her, more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me: For ſhe perceiving how his affection to <hi>Iſidore</hi> encreaſed, and all his expreſſions unto her, were onely to pleaſe the Emperor, ſhe reſolved to entertaine my love, rather then to be the wife of an Emperour, and to accept of my ſervice, ſince <hi>Valentinian</hi> was wholy devoted unto the ſervice of <hi>Iſidore.</hi> I knew her reſolution preſently after: for upon the firſt opportunity which preſented it ſelfe, ſhe told me, that my conſtancy, and <hi>Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> affection unto <hi>Iſidore</hi> had overcome her: And that if I did continue ſtill in my diſcreet behaviour ſhe would continue her affection to me: So as ever ſince that day, ſhe permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to call her in private, my Princeſs; and ſhe called me her my Cavalier. Judge, <hi>Silvander,</hi> whether ever man was more happy then my ſelfe. For <hi>Eudoxe</hi> was abſolutely the faireſt Princeſs in the whole world; aged about ſcaventeene or eighteen yeares, and never loved any one but I.</p>
               <p>Whilſt we lived thus in this manner, <hi>Honorius</hi> who marryed the Daughter of <hi>Stilicon,</hi> dyed without Iſſue: And becauſe a Roman whoſe name was <hi>John,</hi> his Principall Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was elected Emperour by the meanes of <hi>Caſtinus</hi> and <hi>Aetius,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> intending to make his coſen Germaine <hi>Valentinian,</hi> Emperour of the Weſt, he would ſend him thither with his Mother <hi>Placidia.</hi> I made a floriſh as if I were deſirous to make one in this voyage but indeed my deſires were to ſtay for the gaurd of <hi>Eudoxe:</hi> For though the deſire of glory did invite me into <hi>Italy,</hi> yet love kept me at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> by ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger tyes: for this faire Princeſs did ſo ſecond her promiſe, as her affection was no leſſe to me, then mine to her. At the firſt, I believed her intention was not to go ſo farre But love in this reſembles death; for as one cannot dye, ſo one cannot love, by halves. Now as I was pumping for a good excuſe to ſtay at home, the Emperour received inetlligence of a great Army which was marching towards <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> This newes invited many to ſtay, who otherwiſe in point of honour and duty would have gone under the conduct of <hi>Artabures,</hi> who carryed a very great Army by Sea; having with him, <hi>Aſpar</hi> his Son; a very valiant and fortunate Commander, as afterwards he made it evidently appeare by taking <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and delivering his Father. Now though I was not jealous of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> for all <hi>Eudoxe's</hi> favourable aſpect upon him, becauſe I knew it was onely to pleaſe <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> yet I ſeemed as if I were, and ſeemed to rejoyce very much at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not now relate unto you, the voyage of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> for I believe you have heard it by many: But ſo it was, that after all things were ſet in good order in the Weſt, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Where he was received by <hi>Theodoſius</hi> as if he were his Sonne: And by the ſolicitation of <hi>Phacidia</hi> who ſtayed in <hi>Italy,</hi> the marriage of the faire <hi>Eudoxe</hi> was concluded upon. It is impoſible I ſhould expreſſe my ſad reſentments upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: I could not believe it, and was ſo ſurcharged with feares and ſorrow, that, but for <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> I had not been able to have ſupported them. But ſhe who was wiſe and prudent, though it grieved her to the very ſoul that ſhe was to be his whom ſhe did not love, yet ſhe ſurmounted her ſorrow by reſolution. And becauſe ſhe ſaw in what paine I lived, ſhe gave me the opportunity of ſpeaking to her in her cloſſet, when none was preſent but <hi>Iſidore,</hi> whom ſhe did infinitly love Well my Cavalier (ſaid ſhe unto me) I ſee you ſtill doubt of my affection; and complaine againſt me.</p>
               <p>My faireſt Princeſs, (ſaid I unto her) had I not been accuſtomed to receive more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from you than I can any way merit, you might have had ſome reaſon to ſay ſo now, when I do receive ſo high a one, as tranſcends all degrees of gratitude, to acknowledge ſufficiently. But why will you not give me leave to complaine of my fortune, who ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me the good which ſhe may give, me gives it unto another, whoſe merits in matter of love are inferiour unto mine? my Cavalier, anſwered ſhe, live contentedly, and be aſſured,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:53526:204"/>
that <hi>Urſaces</hi> enjoyes all that a violent affection can obtaine: And what favour I ſhew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any other is more out of duty then love, and ſince it is ſo, what reaſon have you to complaine againſt your fortune? My reaſon for it, replyed I, is as great as my obligation unto you for this aſſurance. Why (my faireſt Princeſs) ſhould I not complain of her who in lieu of favouring my affection, does deprive me of that which onely can bring me unto the happineſſe which I deſire? Oh Cavalier (ſaid ſhe) you do offend me. What? would you not have loved me, but onely to obtaine that of me which my duty deſires you? What did you think of me, and how little did you love me, if you have ſo bad an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of me? I was not able to anſwer her, ſeeing how ſhe took it; but kneeling down, with a deep ſigh, I ſtopped my mouth by holding her hand upon it. At the laſt, I roſe up again, and anſwered her: I muſt needs confeſſe, my faireſt Princeſſe, that I do love you more then you would, and more then reaſon would; but who can love you leſſe? I muſt confeſſe, that neither reaſon nor duty, can meaſure the grandure of my affection; and if I do offend you in it, I beſeech you pardon me, conſidering, that to love you leſſe, would be to prophane your beauty. Alſo, I beg your pitty, who have ſo much courage, &amp; yet want ſo much merit. And yet you might well winke at theſe faults, if love had a little more force in you. I do not underſtand you, ſaid ſhe unto me. Alas! replyed I, how hard a matter it is to make you underſtand it by my words, if love will not make you conceive it? But, I mean, my Princeſſe, that if love had a little more power over you, this duty which you ſpeak of would have leſſe; the too-happy <hi>Valentinian</hi> would enjoy what he is in queſt of, and I, what I deſire. Oh Cavalier (ſaid ſhe, with a deep ſigh) did you but know the reſentments of my ſoul, and what reſtraint it is in, you would know, that Love hath as much power over me, as it can have over any heart: If I do deny you any teſtimony of this power, conſider my birth, and unto what Lawes it obliges me. Had I been the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Athenian <hi>Leontine,</hi> as my Mother was, I might have diſpoſed of my ſelfe and my affection; but being Daughter unto the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> Grandchild unto the Emperour <hi>Arcadins,</hi> and having <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the great unto my great Grandfather, do you not ſee, I am not my owne but theirs, who gave me my beeing? It is the Tribute of humanity, and the Law of divinity, to ſubmit unto Emperours and Grandure; Reaſon of State, as well as Love, is to be conſidered. This is no newes either to you or me, we both foreſaw this long ſince; and when I firſt ſet my eyes and affection upon you, it was ſtill with a reſolution to marry <hi>Valentinian;</hi> I am confident you had the ſame thoughts, the firſt day you began to love me. What is it then which now troubleth you? What acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents have hapned, which ſhould divert us from our firſt principles? Theſe words touched me ſo to the quick, that I could not permit her to go on without interruption: Can you think, Madam, ſaid I unto her, that theſe are conſiderations of Love? Can love be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to any Lawes of duty? Oh heavens! how infinitely are you and I miſtaken? You, in thinking that you love; and I, in thinking that you loved me. Then, ſtopping a little, I began again, when I ſaw ſhe offered to ſpeak: The Lawes of Love, Madam, are far different from thoſe you mention, and if you would know what they are, read them in me, and you will finde, that as the great inequality which is betwixt us, could not keep me from lifting up my eyes ſo high as my faireſt Princeſſe, ſo it ſhould not divert you from looking ſo low, as your poor Cavalier; for, there is no more difference betwixt you and me, then betwixt me and you. And as to what you alledge concerning your birth, ſince it is ſo high, that it is in the ſuperlative degree, and can admit of no higher then you are, why ſhould you not in lieu of looking at Grandure, which can receive no addition in you, caſt your eyes upon your own contentment, to the end, that as you are by birth the greateſt Princeſſe in the world, ſo you may be, by your choice, the moſt contented Princeſſe that ever was? You ſay, that I began to ſerve you, in the opinion, that <hi>Valentinian</hi> ſhould be your Husband: Oh, Madam, I muſt confeſſe, that when I firſt devoted my ſelfe unto your ſervice, I thought my ſelfe able to ſupport that opinion; but, ſince my affection is ſo encreaſed, that it is abſolutely impoſſible for me to endure it, what can you anſwer me, but that your affection is weak, ſince it is not augmented more then it was at firſt? I wonder, my faireſt Princeſſe, how you can deny your favours unto me, who adores you, and confer them upon one, who does not love you. Can you ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that your beauty, which without all diſpute, may be the recompence and perfect fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of any true Lover, ſhould be enjoyed by one that diſdaines it, and does not value it? How can you endure his carraſſes, and not pitty the pain of your poor Cavalier? <hi>Iſidore,</hi> who heard our diſcourſe, and was very deſirous to favour us, not out of any ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:53526:205"/>
ſhe bare unto me, or any deſire ſhe had to have any hand in ſuch buſineſſes, but out of a hope, that this affection might paſſe ſo far, that perhaps it might break off the Marriage of <hi>Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Eudoxe;</hi> and to give us more opportunity of talking together, ſhe withdrew her ſelfe into a little Cloſet, in which at the laſt ſhe fell aſleep. I preſently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, though I had my back towards her, becauſe paſſing betwixt the candle, I ſaw her ſhadow againſt the wall, which made me obſerve her when ſhe went away. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, who was leaning upon her arme in the Couch, and was very attentive upon what I ſaid unto her, never obſerved her, though ſhe went cloſe by her. And becauſe my laſt words touched her to the quick, ſhe ſtayed a long while before ſhe anſwered, and ſtill loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon the ground: At the laſt, ſhe raiſed her ſelfe up, and with a deep ſigh, ſaid thus: Oh my Cavalier, how cruelly do your words wound my ſoul? But what can I do? What will become of me? If I do not marry <hi>Valentinian,</hi> what will be thought of me? And if I do marry him, unto what a torment am I deſtined? At theſe laſt words, I ſaw tears trickle down her cheeks, and ſhe durſt not ſpeak more, leſt her words ſhould too much betray her own weakneſſe. Theſe tears moved me to much pitty, giving me no ſmall aſſurance, and much augmenting my courage. I muſt confeſſe, (kinde <hi>Silvander)</hi> that I never hoped to bring this Princeſſe unto this; but finding more love in her then I did imagine, I took upon me more boldneſſe then ever I intended. I approached therefore a little neerer unto her then before, and ſeeming, as if I would only ſupport her drooping head in my breaſt, my mouth was juſt betwixt her eyes; I durſt not at the firſt kiſſe her, only ſeemed, as if what I did, was not done intentionally; but ſeeing ſhe ſaid nothing, I deſcended by little and little, untill my mouth met hers; and becauſe ſhe gave me no check, I put my hand into her breaſt, but with ſo much raviſhment, that I trembled like a leafe ſhaken with the winde. Since that time, I have been in many dangers, and ſeverall deep-fought Battles, but I was never ſo ſenſible of fear, as upon this occaſion. Thus ſhe permitted me this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; but when I grew to be a little bolder, ſhe ſaid thus unto me: Fie, fie, my Cavalier, what do you mean? <hi>Iſidore</hi> will ſee you. It is long ſince, my faireſt Princeſſe, (ſaid I unto her) ſhe left us alone. How, (ſaid ſhe, and ſtarted up) is not <hi>Iſidore</hi> here? ſhe is very much to blame in leaving us alone. Why, Madam, ſaid I, we have no buſineſſe for her. Perhaps not you, replyed ſhe, but I have; and if you do love me, as you ſay you do, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with theſe favours which I have permitted, and preſſe me not to confer more upon you, then I ought or can. I thought, that the preſence of <hi>Iſidore</hi> would have reſtrained you from offering any thing, but what decency allowed; and could have wiſhed, it might have been ſhe, and not I, that ſhould have given you the check, to the end, you may ſee how willing I am, to give you full aſſurance of my affection; but ſince ſhe is gone, and ſince you cannot keep within the limits of what you ought, I am conſtrained to tell you, that if you make any attempts againſt my honour, I will permit you, but upon condition, that I have, a naked Dagger in my hand, to pierce my heart preſently, for the fault which you ſhould conſtrain me to commit: If you would have me live, then conſtrain me not, I beſeech you to permit that, which I ought not to do, unleſſe I die. I muſt confeſſe, theſe words did put me into ſuch a confuſion, that riſing from the place where I was, and falling down upon my knees, I proteſted unto her, that I would never ſeek for any further teſtimonies of her affection, nor ſatisfaction to my deſires greater, then thoſe ſhe hath been pleaſed to ſhew unto me. If you do ſo, ſaid ſhe unto me, I will as long as I live allow you the ſame pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy you have received; and this proof of that affection which you bear unto me, ſhall be pleaſing unto me, knowing, that right love can keep within the limits of decency. Upon this, ſhe took my head in both her hands, and kiſſed me, as an earneſt of her promiſe, and we ſpake ſo loud, that we awaked <hi>Iſidore.</hi> Now becauſe the night was far ſpent, and the candles almoſt out, <hi>Eudoxe</hi> called her, and asked what a clock it was. 'Tis time, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid ſhe, that we go to bed, for every one is aſleep except you. Do you think, <hi>Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,</hi> ſaid the Princeſſe, that <hi>Valentinian</hi> is not now awake for his Miſtreſſe? I know not what he does, ſaid <hi>Iſidore;</hi> but I am ſure, if I were in bed, I ſhould ſleep ſoundly. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered her, That it was in bed where he would finde her. What! anſwered ſhe, would you be any where elſe? The Princeſſe laughed, and ſaid unto her: What do you think on, <hi>Iſidore?</hi> I believe you are yet aſleep. What would you have me do, (ſaid ſhe, and rubbed her eyes)? <hi>Urſaces</hi> makes a fool of me.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe it was late, <hi>Eudoxe</hi> roſe up, kiſſed me, and commanded me to retire, which I did, but not without uſing the priviledge of kiſſing her, which ſhe had given unto me: And becauſe ſhe ſaw, that <hi>Iſidore</hi> obſerved her, and ſaid nothing, <hi>Eudoxe</hi> ſaid thus
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:53526:205"/>
unto her: What do you look at, <hi>Iſidore?</hi> I look, Madam (anſwered ſhe) whether the Bee have much ſtrng you. What Bee, ſaid the Princeſſe? The Bee in the Garden, anſwered ſhe, againſt which this Cavalier hath ſo often given you a Receipt. Upon this, taking the Candle which was upon the Table, ſhe lighted me down the ſtairs into the Court; but not before <hi>Eudoxe</hi> ſmiled, and ſaid unto her: Take heed, leſt being alone with him, he do apply the ſame Receipt unto you. Neverfear, Madam, (ſaid ſhe) that Receipt will not do any effect upon me, becauſe I do not believe in his words.</p>
               <p>See upon what termes I was, when <hi>Valentinian</hi> married this fair Princeſſe, whom preſently after he carried into <hi>Italy.</hi> I ſhall paſſe over my ſorrowes and diſpleaſures I had, eſpecially the marriage night. But thoſe of the fair <hi>Eudoxe</hi> were no leſſe, as afterwards ſhe told me; and <hi>Iſidore,</hi> whom ſhe carried with her, when ſhe left <hi>Greece,</hi> becauſe of the great confidence ſhe had in her. You may imagine, that <hi>Valentinian</hi> did not contrary her in it. But as this firſt night was almoſt intollerable to me, ſo I needed not to ſeek out for an excuſe, in not following this fair Princeſſe; for, I was fallen extreamly ſick, upon the great diſpleaſure which I conceived, when <hi>Valentinian</hi> departed. After I had recovered my health, I begged leave of the Emperour to follow <hi>Ariobindes</hi> and <hi>Aſilas,</hi> two great Commanders, which he preferred unto <hi>Valentinian,</hi> with an Army, to aſſiſt him againſt the innundation of the barbarous people, who threatned from all ſides to fall upon the Empire. My age and my juſt requeſt, eaſily obtained what I asked. But, as ill luck was, this Army was countermanded back, becauſe <hi>Attilas,</hi> with the <hi>Hunnes, Almaines,</hi> and <hi>Gepides,</hi> and an infinite world of people, were upon their March towards <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> This countermand was no ſooner brought unto <hi>Ariobindes</hi> and <hi>Aſilas,</hi> but they heard of the death of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> who being infected with the Plague, dyed ſuddenly, without Iſſue-male. I had no diſpoſition to carry this ſad newes unto the fair <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought <hi>Ariobindes,</hi> that I might accompany the Meſſenger whom he ſent, ſeeming very deſirous to ſee <hi>Italy,</hi> before I returned; which requeſt he eaſily granted unto me. In our way, we came to <hi>Naples,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Rome,</hi> where I was welcomed with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable caraſſes. <hi>Eudoxe</hi> did ſadly reſent the death of her Father, as nature required of her; and during the dayes of mourning, <hi>Valentinian</hi> received intelligence, that <hi>Pulcheria,</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> who had married an old Generall, called <hi>Marcianus,</hi> had gotten him to be elected Emperour. This <hi>Marcianus</hi> was he, whom <hi>Genſerick</hi> King of the <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls,</hi> having him Priſoner in <hi>Affrica,</hi> did ſee the Eagle flie, and with whom he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards contracted a great league of friendſhip. And becauſe he was a very great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, and of high reputation, he quickly forced <hi>Attilas</hi> to retreat into <hi>Pannonia,</hi> where envying his Brother <hi>Bledas,</hi> he traiterouſly murdered him, that he might remain ſole King over all thoſe barbarous People. When I had intelligence of the election of this new Emperour, and that <hi>Attilas</hi> was repulſed, I conceived, that then there was nothing which could invite me out of <hi>Italy;</hi> but that, War being on all ſides, it was better to ſtay where my Love invited me. As I was in theſe conſiderations, the Emperour was adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that this <hi>Attilas,</hi> who may well be phraſed, the ſcourge of god, had taken <hi>Gaul</hi> for his firſt deſigne: and having by his Armes ſubjected <hi>Valamer</hi> and <hi>Ardarick,</hi> Kings of the <hi>Oſtrogots</hi> and <hi>Gepides,</hi> he conſtrained them to joyne with his Forces, which were compoſed of <hi>Erulians, Almains, Turingians, Marcomances,</hi> and of ſome <hi>Francks,</hi> who remained in their old habitations beyond the <hi>Rhein,</hi> when under the great <hi>Pharamond,</hi> this warlick Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple forced their paſſage, and poſſeſſed themſelves of that Country, which now they hold in <hi>Gaul,</hi> and which began then, from the name of <hi>Francks,</hi> to be called <hi>France.</hi> As ſoon as this newes was made certain, the Emperour re-inforced the Army of the Patriarch <hi>Aetius,</hi> who was one of the beſt and greateſt of all the Roman Captains, and who had the charge of the <hi>Gaules.</hi> Now though it went much againſt my minde to leave the fair <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> yet, go I muſt: and when I asked leave of her: Why, my Cavalier, (ſaid ſhe unto me) will you be ſo far diſtant from me? What cauſe have I given unto you? Have you ſo ſlender affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to leave me thus? My faireſt Princeſſe, ſaid I unto her, if I ſhould not go in this expedition, wherein all the Gallantry of the Court are employed, what will the world think of my courage? What will they think, if I ſtay at home? Nay, what would your ſelfe think of me? Unto which ſhe anſwered, with a ſmile: I remember, that before my Marriage, none of theſe excuſes were urged. What! do you love me leſſe now then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Believe it, though I will keep within compaſſe of my duty, yet I do love you as well now as then, and ſhall be very ſorry to part from you. Then ſhe kiſſed me: Remember
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:53526:206"/>
(continued ſhe) that you return quickly, and be ſtill faithfull. Thus I left her, and went unto <hi>Aetius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Valentinian,</hi> who was infinitely in love with the wiſe <hi>Iſidore,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtill his addreſſes, but with abundance of warineſſe and diſcretion; and thinking, that her denyall proceeded only from ſome fears, as commonly young women have, that it would ſpoil her Marriage, if it ſhould be known, that ſhe was loved: Therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to marry her; and thinking with himſelfe, who in all the Court was moſt fit for her, he pitched upon <hi>Maximus,</hi> a Roman Knight; of great authority; he was thought the fitteſt perſon for the buſineſſe, as well, becauſe he was often in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence he might eaſily ſee her; as becauſe he was very ambitious, and by doing him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, he might the more eaſily deceive and abuſe him. <hi>Maximus,</hi> who deſired to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and who expected his advancement from the Emperour, received this offer as a very great honour; for, the Lady was very fair, and of an illuſtrious Family; alſo, had as good a reputation as any in the Court. <hi>Iſidore,</hi> on the other ſide, was not againſt it; for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus</hi> was as rich as any in <hi>Rome,</hi> and had been twice Conſul. Alſo the Empreſſe, who infinitely loved this Lady, was very glad that ſhe was to be married in <hi>Rome</hi> ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly. There being therefore no obſtruction in this Match, Marriage was preſently conſummated, to the contentment of them both. But when the Emperour, ſome few daies after, offered ſome addreſſes unto the wiſe <hi>Iſidore,</hi> he found her more ſlack and cool in her affection, then before; at which the Emperour was ſo vexed, as he reſolved to have no longer any recourſe unto ſupplications. It hapned then, that he and <hi>Maximus</hi> being at play, as they often uſed, fortune was ſo averſe to <hi>Maximus,</hi> that he loſt all his mony; and having nothing about him to make ſtake, but a Ring which he uſually ſealed withall, he pulled it off from his finger, put it to the ſtake, and loſt it. The Emperour conceiving, he had met with a good occaſion to accompliſh his deſigne, he pretended ſome important buſineſs, and leaving one in his room, he bad him play on upon credit, till <hi>Maximus</hi> had quitted all he had won; which he did, only upon deſigne to amuze him the more. In the mean time, he ſent to the wiſe <hi>Iſidore,</hi> in her Husbands name, commanding her to come and viſit the Empreſſe, and as a token of his deſire, ſhewed unto her the Ring of her Husband. She giving credit to the Meſſenger, and ſuſpecting nothing, went, and was conducted into the Garden being told that the Empreſſe was there: Being brought into the moſt retired place of all the Garden, you may imagine how aſtoniſhed ſhe was, when ſhe ſaw her ſelfe in the hands of <hi>Valentinian:</hi> She began preſently to look very pale upon it, and to tremble. The Emperour ſeeing it, took her by the hand, and would have carried her to ſit downe in an Arbour, which was in the midſt of the Garden; but ſeeing her ſelfe alone with him, ſhe refuſed to enter; yet, he taking her by the arme forced her in, and ſhut the dore after them. Oh heavens! <hi>Silvander,</hi> in what a terrible affright was poor <hi>Iſidore,</hi> when ſhe ſaw this violent beginning; it was as great, as if ſhe had been brought to the place of execution. But the Emperour, thinking to vanquiſh her by fair words, and thinking, that no woman would deny him, he ſat down by her, and ſpoke in this manner: I make no doubt, fair <hi>Iſidore,</hi> but you think this ſtratagem which I have uſed, very ſtrange, and, perhaps, are angry with me for it; but I hope, when you conſider the violence of my affection, how long it hath continued, and how neither my owne reaſons, nor your rigour, can quench it, I hope, I ſay, that you will pardon my boldneſſe, that you will not think this action ſtrange, but will render my affection ſome ſatisfaction, before you depart from hence: Every thing does invite us to it; firſt, my unequal'd affection; next, the quality of him who loves you, who being Emperour, you may aſpire unto the Empire, if you will render me as much ſatisfaction, as my love deſerves; and laſtly, the conſideration of <hi>Maximus</hi> may move you unto it, ſince you may ſee by his Ring, that he does not only conſent unto it, but deſire it. What then, my fair <hi>Iſidore,</hi> ſhould hinder you, from giving ſatisfaction to my longing deſires? Then offering to kiſſe her, ſhe turned her head the other way, and would not permit him, but beſeeched him, to ſit down and hear her, deſiring if it were poſſible to overcome him by ſweetneſſe: I muſt needs confeſſe, Sir, (ſaid ſhe unto him) that I am infinitely amazed, to ſee my ſelfe alone with you, in this dark and ſolitary place, and ſo much againſt my minde, ſince upon it, depends the ruine of my honour and my life; but, I have a great confidence, that you will do nothing againſt reaſon, or my will, eſpecially when I do conſider, who you are, and who I am. Conſidering you as your ſelfe, why ſhould I fear, being in the hands of the
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:53526:206"/>
great <hi>Valentinian,</hi> Son to the generous Emperour <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> the moſt accompliſhed of any that ever wore the name of <hi>Ceſar? Valentinian,</hi> I ſay, whoſe Mother was the wiſe <hi>Placidia,</hi> the honour and patterne of all Ladies. Can you think, great Sir, that I am affraid of you, whoſe wiſdome is known throughout all the world, and whoſe prudence every one admires; alſo one, from whom Juſtice is generally expected. I ſhould ſhew my ſelfe too ignorant of my Emperour's excellencies, did I doubt his goodneſſe, or fear any harm from him in this ſolitary place, where I am alone with him: No, no, I dare truſt my ſelfe any where, in the hands of my honoured Emperour: but I muſt needs confeſſe, I think it ſtrange that I ſhould be brought hither by the conſent of <hi>Maximus:</hi> It vexeth me to the ſoul that he ſhould thinke me ſo unworthy, and that I ſhould have one to my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band who is the very ſhame, and ſcorne of men.</p>
               <p>Now Sir, I will not aske what it is you would have of me, nor what occaſion brought you to this place. That Traytor who is the owner of this Ring, and your owne diſcourſe does but too plainly tell it. But I do moſt humbly beſeech you, great and good Sir, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that I have no more honour when this is gone, and if you love me, let me live worthy of great <hi>Ceſars</hi> love: Conſider Sir, that you trample under your feet, the honour and the life of her you love, and will ſo much injure your owne honour and reputation, as well as mine, as I know it will be impoſſible for you, to repaire it againe. You tell me that in rendering you this ſatisfaction, I may pretend unto the Empire: Oh heavens? can you think me worthy ſo much as to live after ſo great a crime, and ſtaine unto mine honour? If you do beare any good will unto me, preſerve me unſtained untill you can make me ſuch as you ſay, and ſtay till it ſhall pleaſe the gods to bring it to paſſe. If there be any truth in your words, that you do love me. And if you do love me, never offer that which will make me exteamly hate you. Can you imagine, I ſhall ever love him that raviſheth away my honour, which is much dearerto me, then my life? No, no, Sir; I never can. But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, think upon <hi>Conſtantius</hi> your Father, think upon <hi>Placidia</hi> your Mother, and think upon God, who hath miraculouſly ſeated you in the Throne: he hath given you power to vanquiſh <hi>John,</hi> by the hand of young <hi>Aſpar: John</hi> I ſay, who otherwiſe had poſſeſſed the Empire: he hath overcome for you, the valiant <hi>Caſtinus,</hi> by the valour of <hi>Artabures,</hi> who a little before was a priſoner in <hi>Ravenna:</hi> he hath ſubjected unto you, the Prudent <hi>Aetius,</hi> by the meanes of thoſe who hardly knew you: He hath defeated <hi>Boniface</hi> the Uſurper of <hi>Affrica;</hi> he hath made the Puiſſant <hi>Genſerick</hi> King of the <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi> your friend: To be briefe, what has not this great God done for you? And how thankfull ought you to be unto him? Now Sir, the very ſame god who has done all theſe for you, does at this very inſtant ſee you, and obſerves what cauſe you will give him either to continue his favours, or to ſend you puniſhments: Conſider what miſerable acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and fatall tragedies, have heretofore beſalne this Empire, upon the like occaſions as this.</p>
               <p>Oh moſt omnipotent Diety, rather ſhowre downe all thy thunderbolts upon me, and hide me in the profundity of the earth, then ſuffer me to be any cauſe of moving thy wrath againſt this Emperour. Upon this, ſhe kneeled downe, and continued; And you, great Sir, I beſeech you rather put me to death, then raviſh from me, that which makes me worthy of your love, or before you make me inſtrumentall to bring the odium both of god and men upon you. Now Sir, ſhew, that you are truly <hi>Ceſar,</hi> and be as well a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander over your paſſions, as you are victorious over your enemyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Valentinian</hi> ſeeing her upon her knees, he tooke her up, and was ſo moved with her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as he was aſhamed of what he had done, and wiſhed that he had never attempted it. Her words did ſo flow with reaſon as faſt as her eyes with teares: ſo as working upon her good nature, they forced him into a reſolution of overcoming himſelfe, and promiſed her with an oath, that he would never uſe any force againſt her. But he beſeeched her to take his affection into her conſideration, to forget what he would have attempted, and that when <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Eudoxe</hi> dyed, ſhe ſhould marry him. The wiſe <hi>Iſidore</hi> hearing theſe words, began to take: heart; to promiſe him all that he deſired, and to beſeech him, he would permit her to depart. Upon this <hi>Valentinian</hi> kiſſed her hand, and with a deep ſigh, called unto him <hi>Heracles</hi> the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> whom he truſted moſt of any in the Court and whoſe counſell he moſt followed: This <hi>Eunuch,</hi> was a very wicked man, nothing pleaſing, only faithful. But he was the moſt coveteous wretch, and the greateſt flatterer that ever breathed. This was he who carried the Ring of <hi>Maximus</hi> unto <hi>Iſidore,</hi> and conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:53526:207"/>
her into the Garden: Now becauſe the Emperor deſired that this buſineſſe might be carried with all ſecreſy that was poſſible, he tooke none with him but this man, whom he commanded to ſtay behind the Arbor, and to come unto him when he called. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> hearing the Emperors voyce, ran preſently unto him, thinking that becauſe <hi>Iſidore</hi> would not conſent unto the Emperours will, he called him to helpe: but when he heard, that he was commanded to conduct her back: Is it impoſſible Sir, (ſaid he) that words ſhould ſo farre prevaile, as to let ſo faire an opportunity to ſlippe? and to let her go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one touch? Shall a little feare make you loſe ſo faire an opportunity? Do you think ſhe would have given you ſuch ſweet language, but onely to get out of your hands? Do you inſiſt upon what will be ſaid concerning your ſelfe, or her? The worſt report that can be, will be only this, that you were infinitly in love with a faire Lady. What hurt is there in all that? the worſt will be but nine dayes wonder. Whatſoever you do, will be done in ſecret betwixt you two, and what wound will that be to any reputation. As for any matter of conſcience alas Sir god knowes, that though you be <hi>Ceſar</hi> yet you are but a man and will excuſe it as a humane ſlip as well in you as in others. If he ſhould pardon none that are guilty of ſuch a crime he would be alone in heaven; few mortalls would ever come there: loſe not therefore ſuch an opportunity, which you will repent, if you let it ſlip and make no uſe of it.</p>
               <p>The wiſe <hi>Iſidore,</hi> ſeeing the Emperor lend an eare unto the wicked perſwaſions of <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> offered to anſwere unto what he had urged, but the <hi>Eunuch</hi> being afraid, did inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt her thus: Sir, (ſaid he) do not hearken unto the voyce of this Syren who ſpeakes onely againſt her owne conſcience, and would be glad to be forced unto that which ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes: beleeve it, if you let this opportunity ſlip, ſhe will diſeſteeme you, and mock you: and if you will give me leave to hold her, ſhe will thank me: and you ſhall ſee whether or no, I ſay true: Then offering to lay hands upon her, ſhe gave him ſuch a blow upon the face, as blood immediately guſhed out of his noſe: but the <hi>Eunuch</hi> being accuſtomed unto ſuch encounters, and ſeeing the Emperour ſaid nothing, did get behind her, and foulded her armes within his, ſo as ſhe could not ſtirre. Then ſhe began to cry out, and make the beſt defence ſhe could; but all to no purpoſe: for the Emperour, by the helpe of <hi>Heracles</hi> had what he deſired of her. Ah <hi>Valentinian</hi> (ſaid ſhe unto him) thou haſt done an act unworthy of thy ſelfe; and I will dye, but I will be revenged; Then ſhe fell upon <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> and with her nailes and teeth, hurt him in a hundred places, and not being able to do him any more hurt, ſhe ran out of the Arbor to ſeeke for ſomething wherewith ſhe might kill both <hi>Valentinian</hi> and herſelfe: but as fortune was ſhe found nothing, ſhe ſtill thinking upon this injury, would gladly have killed herſelfe, ſhe ſtruck her ſelfe upon the face, tore her haire, and uſed all the actions of one tranſported. When <hi>Valentinian</hi> ſaw her in this condition; he began to perſwade her, to aske her pardon, to accuſe the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and promiſing to do for her whatſoever ſhe would aske. She being hardly able to ſtand, for wearineſſe and ſorrow, ſat downe upon a ſeat, ſo much out of her ſelfe as ſhe was hardly able to ſpeake. <hi>Valentinian</hi> came to her, did ſet himſelfe downe by her, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his ſupplications, and told her that her husband knew nothing of it; and then related to her how he came by the Ring.</p>
               <p>The Emperour told her this, to the end ſhe ſhould not tell <hi>Maximus</hi> and to give her ſome conſolation in knowing that her husband was ignorant of it: for her greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure was, to think that her husband ſhould conſent unto it. But when ſhe heard that he was innocent, ſhe was much better ſatisfyed, hoping now, that he would revenge her wrong. After ſhe had ſat ſadly a long while and ſpoke not a word, ſhe conſtrained her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo, that <hi>Valentinian</hi> thought her a little better ſatisfied: for ſhe ſeemed much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented that <hi>Maximus</hi> knew nothing of it, and conjured him to keep it ſecret both from him and all the world, to the end ſhe might live ſtill in the good opinion of every one. The Emperour, who did moſt paſſionatly love her, &amp; who but for the <hi>Eunuch</hi> had never uſed any force, he promiſed her with a thouſand oathes that he would do whatſoever ſhe deſired: and charged the <hi>Eunuch</hi> that he ſhould never ſpeake the leaſt ſyllable of it to any in the world. After ſhe had tyed up her haire, and dreſſed herſelfe as well as ſhe could, ſhe went home, where ſhe expected the comming home of her husband, whom <hi>Valentinian</hi> found ſtill at play, and had recovered ſome part of his loſſes: Night being come, he went home, where he was no ſooner come, but according to his cuſtome he went to ſee his wiſe and deare <hi>Iſidore:</hi> ſhe was in her cloſet all alone, ſo ſwel'd with teares, as when he ſaw
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:53526:207"/>
her he was aſtoniſhed and entreating him to ſit downe by her, husband (ſaid ſhe unto him) do not wonder to ſee me in this condition: I have ſo much occaſion for it, that I will live no longer: but, before I die, ſatisfie me ſo farre as to ſweare, that you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge my death. <hi>Maximus,</hi> who did extreamly love this Lady, both for her wiſedome and beauty, he came to her as his cuſtome was, to kiſs her and to know what it was which ſo much troubled her. But ſhe recoyled, and ſaid unto him: It is not reaſonable, <hi>Maximus,</hi> that you ſhould come any neerer unto this defiled body; I am not now the ſame <hi>Iſidore,</hi> whom you have ſo much loved, and who never loved any but you. I am another woman, who dares not call you Husband. The moſt wicked and cruell Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that ever was, hath defiled me, and I will not live any longer, ſince I am not worthy to be your Wife. Upon this, ſhe related the whole paſſage unto him, and ſhewed him the blood of <hi>Heracles,</hi> which dropt upon her, as he held her. I ſhould be too long and tedious, if I did relate all the complaints which paſſed betwixt <hi>Maximus</hi> and her.</p>
               <p>But ſo it was, that Revenge was reſolved upon; but he deſired her, upon any termes, not to ſhorten her daies, leſt ſhe ſhould incenſe the gods againſt her, telling her, that he would carve her ſo much revenge, as ſhould give her ſatisfaction: He told her, that ſince there was not an act of her will conſenting, he ſhould not think her the leſſe chaſte, nor leſſe worthy of being his Wife then before: And that in order to his deſigne, he would have her aſſure <hi>Valentinian,</hi> that ſhe had never acquainted any with it, to the end, he might think himſelfe the more ſecure. She carried the matter ſo, that the Emperour never made queſtion of it, and ſhe gave him back her Husbands Ring, the better to perſwade him. About this time, <hi>Eudoxe</hi> was brought to bed of a Daughter which was called <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> after her own name; and about a year after, was delivered of another, who bore the name of her Grandmother, <hi>Placidia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time we were in <hi>Gaul,</hi> expecting <hi>Attilas,</hi> where <hi>Aetius</hi> was making all neceſſary preparations. This Barbarian, having gathered together a very vaſt Army, as I told you, he intended to fall upon <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> but being prevented in that by the wiſe conduct of <hi>Marcianus,</hi> and not being able to maintain that world of People which followed him, either in <hi>Pannonia</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> which was growne almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart, by the paſſage of ſo many Nations through it, he determined to fall upon the Weſtern Empire, which was already well ſhaked, and begun to totter. The aſſiſtance which <hi>Genſerick</hi> King of the <hi>Vandals</hi> promiſed unto him, was no ſmall ſpur unto his deſigne. This <hi>Vandal</hi> having gotten the Daughter of <hi>Thierres</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> in marriage unto <hi>Honorius</hi> his Son, he had a conceit, that ſhe would poyſon him, and under this pretence, he cut off her noſe, and ſent her back into <hi>Gaul</hi> unto her Father; and ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in fear of his anger, he thought it moſt expedient for him to fortifie himſelfe, with the friendſhip of the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> by promiſing them all manner of aſſiſtance. <hi>Attilas</hi> who promiſed unto his ambition no leſſe then all the Weſtern Empire, having recruited and put his Army into good equipage, he marched towards <hi>Gaul;</hi> but firſt diſpatched an Envoy unto <hi>Thierres,</hi> then the moſt puiſſant King of all thoſe that poſſeſſed it; for, he held almoſt all <hi>Spain,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Gaul,</hi> that is to ſay, from the <hi>Piren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Mountains unto the <hi>Loyre.</hi> And becauſe <hi>Attilas</hi> feared the grandure of this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſant Barbarian, he let him underſtand, that his comming into <hi>Gaul</hi> was only againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> and that they two would divide the Empire betwixt them, as ſoon as it was overthrowne. He ſent the ſame meſſage unto <hi>Gondioch,</hi> King of the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> and unto the valiant <hi>Merovius,</hi> King of the <hi>Francks,</hi> and ſucceſſour unto <hi>Clodion,</hi> the Son of <hi>Pharamond.</hi> He treated and tranſacted ſo ſecretly with <hi>Singiban</hi> King of the <hi>Almaines,</hi> as he promiſed to take his part. But <hi>Aetius,</hi> who was as wiſe a Captain, as was in the whole world, knowing his ſubtlety, did diſcover it unto theſe Kings, giving them to underſtand, that when the <hi>Romans</hi> were defeated, <hi>Attilas</hi> would turn all his forces againſt them, and make them Tributaries to himſelfe, as he had already done <hi>Valamer</hi> and <hi>Ardarick,</hi> and the reſt of his Neighbours; and that the amity of the Emperour <hi>Valentinian,</hi> was more neceſſary and honourable for them: Neceſſary, in reſpect that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was ſo great, and ſurely eſtabliſhed, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them, having ſo puiſſant a Neighbour to their enemy, to ſleep quietly in their houſes. As for <hi>Attilas,</hi> he was but a ſtorme, which looked foul, but would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be blowne over. That the Amity of the Emperour was more honourable unto them,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:53526:208"/>
becauſe <hi>Valentinian</hi> was a great Prince, and a good, and that they were already linked in amity with him. That he had given the <hi>Burgundians</hi> their habitations where they dwelt; and that the amity of <hi>Vualius,</hi> with <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> the Father of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> had gotten the <hi>Viſigots</hi> all that they held in <hi>Gaul.</hi> Briefly, That they had experience al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which might put them out of all doubt: Whereas it would be a mad ſolly in them, to truſt <hi>Attilas,</hi> whoſe ambition was ſuch, as that againſt all rights, both divine and human, he would not ſuffer his Brother <hi>Bleda</hi> to be his partner, but miſerably put him to death. Theſe Remonſtrances cauſed the <hi>Francks,</hi> the <hi>Viſigots,</hi> the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> and the <hi>Almaines,</hi> to confederate themſelves with <hi>Aetius</hi> againſt <hi>Attilas,</hi> who, after ſome years, fell into <hi>Gaul,</hi> with five hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fighting men: The firſt he fell upon was the <hi>Francks,</hi> plundering and firing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all their Townes; but it was only of ſuch, as had not the courage to paſſe over the <hi>Rheine</hi> with the firſt, who took up their habitations in <hi>Gaul.</hi> At the laſt, he came to a Citty of <hi>Carnutes,</hi> called <hi>Orleans,</hi> which he beſieged, and doubtleſſe had taken it, if the <hi>Francks</hi> and <hi>Viſigots</hi> had not appeared with ſuch an Army, as conſtrained him to riſe and go away. This Army, and that of <hi>Aetius,</hi> was compoſed (as well as the Army of <hi>Attilas)</hi> of ſeverall Nations, as of <hi>Francks Viſigots, Sarmatians, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, Armoriguans, La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The next morning therefore, Battle was given. I could give you a particular relation of all the Fight, for I was in it, and fought next <hi>Aetius</hi> that day; but it would be too long, and not pertinent to our diſcourſe: But ſo it was, that <hi>Attilas</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and forced into his Camp, which he had fenced about with his Carriages: And becauſe he had an opinion, the Enemy would fall upon him there, he cauſed a great heap to be made, of all the Saddles and Baggage of the Army, intending to ſet it on fire, and to burne there, rather then to fall into the hands of his enemies. I ſaw him that day, and the next morning alſo; and one might plainly ſee, by his minde and garb, the vanity which was in the ſoul of that man. But <hi>Priſeus,</hi> Secretary unto <hi>Valentinian,</hi> who was ſent into <hi>Syria,</hi> before he came into <hi>Pannonia,</hi> he told me, that he never in all his life ſaw a more imperious or haughty minded man, aiming at no leſſe, then the Monarchy of the whole world; and then gave himſelfe the title of King of the <hi>Hunnes, Medes, Goths, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Gepides.</hi> He alſo took upon him the title of, The terrour of the world and, the ſcourge of god. And becauſe I asked him, whether his ſtature was equall to his courage: he anſwered me, That he was rather low then tall; that he had a large breaſt, a great head, little eyes, but quick and ſparkling; his noſe flat, his hair browne; his ſtrutting pace ſhewed the pride of his minde, and the whole Symmetry of his face, ſpoke him to be a lover of War.</p>
               <p>Moreover, he was ſubtle; and though he was couragious, yet ſeldome uſed to fight in perſon, unleſſe in great extremity, reſerving himſelfe alwaies for a great neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. As he was very cruell and inhumain to his enemies, ſo was he very ſweet and courteous to ſuch as ſubmitted, or having offended, asked pardon; unto whom he would alwaies keep promiſe inviolable, and defend them againſt all whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
               <p>This character which <hi>Priſeus</hi> gave of <hi>Attilas,</hi> at his return to <hi>Rome,</hi> did cauſe <hi>Honorica,</hi> Siſter unto <hi>Valentinian,</hi> to deſire a Marriage with him, as afterwards I ſhall tell you. But in the mean time, to return unto <hi>Aetius,</hi> be pleaſed to know, kinde <hi>Silvander,</hi> that this great Captain being out of <hi>Attilas</hi>'s danger, yet he knew, that he was entring into a greater; for, ſhould the <hi>Francks, Burgundians,</hi> and <hi>Viſigots,</hi> come to know their own ſtrength, they might much offend the Empire. To keep them therefore in ſome fear, he thought it expedient to ſave <hi>Attilas,</hi> thinking, that the fear
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:53526:208"/>
they would have of ſo great an enemy, would keep them alwaies united to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour And becauſe <hi>Thierres.</hi> King of the <hi>Viſigots,</hi> was ſlain in this Battle, and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſmond</hi> and <hi>Thierres,</hi> his Children, in revenge of their Father, would needs force <hi>Attilas</hi> in his Camp, he ſeemed to love them much more, then he hated <hi>Attilas,</hi> and adviſed them to return in all haſte unto <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> with the reſt of their Army, leſt their Brothers who were left there, ſhould ſeize upon the King dome in their abſence. <hi>Thoriſmond,</hi> who was of a diſtruſtfull nature, and knowing that he had three other Brothers in the Country, called <hi>Frederick, Rotomer,</hi> and <hi>Honorick,</hi> alſo taking <hi>Aetius</hi> for his friend, without more delay, he took the Body of his Father, and went in all haſte into <hi>Aquitain,</hi> where he was very well received, his Brothers having no ſuch intention, as <hi>Aetius</hi> perſwaded him. Theſe Forces being thus ſeparated from our Army, it remained ſo weak, that every one was of opinion, that it was beſt to let <hi>Attilas</hi> go away; and that a prudent Captain will make a Bridge of gold ſometimes for his enemy to paſſe over. Thus therefore this enemy of the Empire eſcaped the hands of <hi>Aetius;</hi> and though this great Souldier had a good intention in it, yet afterwards, the Emperour took it very ill.</p>
               <p>I alwaies followed <hi>Aetius</hi> in all this laſt expedition, and durſt not leave the Army, as well becauſe ſeverall occaſions of fighting preſented themſelves, as becauſe the fair <hi>Eudoxe</hi> commanded me ſo to do, being deſirous I ſhould be abſent from her, leſt any ſhould take notice of my familiarity with her: god only knowes how much it was againſt my will, and how often I reſolved to depart, ſetting all conſiderations of duty and diſcre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Yet I ſtayed therefore in the Army about twelve years, at the end of which time, this Battle which I have told you of was fought. 'Tis true that in this long exile, I received many Letters from <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> by which ſhe did ſtill continue unto me aſſurances of her favour. And becauſe I had a great deſire to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which was worthy the amity of ſo great a Princeſſe, I let paſſe no occaſion of ſignalizing my ſelfe, and giving teſtimonies of my courage; by this means I got much reputation in the Army, but more in the opinion of the fair <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> who comming to the knowledge of it, by Letters which <hi>Aetius</hi> writ unto the Emperour, ſhe rejoyced at it.

                        <hi>IT is only my Cavalier, that can aſtoniſh his enemies by his arme, and his friends by his valour. Twice, to relieve the Roman Eagle, and recover it from the</hi> Francks <hi>and</hi> Gepides; <hi>thrice in one day, to ſet</hi> Aetius <hi>upon his Horſe, when he was ready to be trodden in pieces by his enemies, are actions moſt worthy of him, who has my heart. Since for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hath hitherto ſeconded your valour, I do forbid you to venture your ſelfe ſo far for the future, as you have done for the time paſt: And I command you to preſerve your ſelfe, not as your own, but as mine; have a care therefore of that which I give you to keep. And when</hi> Aetius <hi>leaves the Army, come you alſo, and give me an account of it; that as you have ſhared with him in his pains and dangers you may ſhare alſo with him in that honour and welcome, which all</hi> Italy <hi>will give him, and which I will prepare for you.</hi>

               <p>During the time I was in the Army, I fell into a great intimacy with a young Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Cavalier, called <hi>Olimbres,</hi> the ſame you ſee here; many good Offices paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt one another, as in ſuch places many occaſions fall out, which tie ſuch knots of friendſhip, as never are looſed, ſo as nothing ever ſince could ſeparate us. This Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, in reſpect of the amity betwixt us, was ſo much in favour with <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> that he was called to the Senate, and created a Senator: And certainly, next her, he priſed my friendſhip at the higheſt rate, unleſſe <hi>Placidias;</hi> for you muſt know, that the intimacy of affection which was betwixt us, would never let us part, ſince the firſt beginning of our acquaintance, unleſſe it were in the ſervice of each other. So as he ſeeing me reſolved upon a return for <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Aetius</hi> returned, he would needs come with me; and
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:53526:209"/>
ſince, nothing could be ſo ſecret, which was not communicated unto one another; I freely acquainted him with my affection to <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> and her favours to me, yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a ſtrict injunction of ſecrecy upon him, and to take no notice of it leſt ſhe ſhould be offended at me. This declaration was a cauſe, that he growing into familiarity with <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> he preſumed ſo high, as to caſt his eye upon <hi>Placidia,</hi> her Daughter, and began to court her, when ſhe was not above twelve years of age, ſhewing in this a ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy of humour betwixt him and me; for, it was at the ſame age when I began to court her Mother, whom this her Daughter did much reſemble. <hi>Olimbres</hi> was younger then I, being then not above ſeven and twenty years of age, and I about thirty five, and the fair <hi>Eudoxe</hi> about thirty. The fair <hi>Eudoxe</hi> and I took notice of this growing affection, and <hi>Placidia</hi> did not give it any check. And though <hi>Olimbres</hi> was neither King nor Emperour, yet <hi>Eudoxe</hi> was not offended againſt this affection, becauſe <hi>Olimbres</hi> was very rich, and of as illuſtrious a Race, as any in <hi>Rome,</hi> his Father, Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, and great-Grandfather, being all Senators, and oftentimes Conſulls; ſo as upon theſe conſiderations, ſo it came not to the eye of the Emperour, ſhe was not againſt it, eſpecially for the friendſhip ſake, that was betwixt him and me.</p>
               <p>I thought fit to acquaint you with theſe things, before I related my reception by the fair <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> leſt I ſhould be conſtrained to interrupt my diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Know therefore, kinde <hi>Silvander,</hi> that we returning with <hi>Aetius,</hi> we were wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed into <hi>Italy</hi> with all poſſible honour and thanks; the Roman-people made ſuch acclamations, when this great Captain entred into the Town, that never was a greater triumph. But the Emperour had no great liking unto all this; for, this grandure of courage which was in <hi>Aetius,</hi> the prudence wherewith he managed all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is actions, the applaud which the people gave him, and the honour which all <hi>Italy</hi> rendred him, did make <hi>Valentinian</hi> ſo jealous of the grandure of <hi>Aetius,</hi> as he ever after looked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquint upon him, and was apt to hearken and conſent unto any ill counſell that was given him. But for my part, who looked after no matters of State, but was wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon the favour of the fair <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> as ſoon as I arrived with <hi>Aetius,</hi> and had kiſſed the Emperours hand, I went unto the Empreſſe, where, pretending I had ſome buſineſſe with her from my Generall, I ſaw her in private, and received ſuch a welcome, as my twelve years ſeemed well imployed, ſince army return I received ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary favours. Being at the laſt conſtrained to go out of her Cloſet, loſt my too long ſtay ſhould beget ſuſpicion, I went unto the wiſe <hi>Iſidore,</hi> as to one, whom, next <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe,</hi> I loved and honoured moſt; but, I found her ſo changed from what ſhe was wont to be, as I wondred at it: I asked her the cauſe, but all the anſwer I could get, was tears, at which I wondred more: I thought at firſt, that cares of Marriage might perhaps be the cauſe; or elſe perhaps, her Husband was very ſharp with her, or elſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained her for ſome other; and this doubt made me ſhorten my viſit ſooner then I would: But when afterwards I obſerved, that <hi>Maximus</hi> did love her, and infinitely carraſſed her; and when I looked upon the riches and plenty of his houſe, I was quite out of my firſt opinion, and could not imagine what ſhould be the cauſe of her ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But one night, as I was talking with the fair <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> I underſtood, that ſhe came very ſeldome at Court, and was ſo altered, as ſhe hardly knew her. I began preſently to ſuſpect the buſineſſe, though not all, yet in part; and enquiring whether the love of <hi>Valentinian</hi> continued; unto which ſhe anſwering, that ſhe never took any notice of it: Believe it, my Princeſſe, ſaid I unto her, that there is ſome ill underſtanding betwixt them; the Emperour hath done her ſome diſpleaſure, or would do, and that keeps her from comming to the Court; for, you have not driven her away by any disfavour, her Husband is not unkinde, Domeſtick affairs cannot trouble her; and therefore her griefe muſt proceed from ſome higher cauſe: Were it any malady of body, it would appear. I do believe, (ſaid ſhe) that you are in the right; for, ſhe never ſees me, but with tears in her eyes; and when the Emperour comes where ſhe is, I ſhall ſee her change pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and go away as ſoon as poſſibly ſhe can: I have often asked her the reaſon, but I could never get her to tell me. Upon theſe conſiderations, ſhe commanded me to go unto her from her, and uſe my beſt endeavours to diſcover the cauſe; but all my labour was loſt, and I could finde out nothing, but a great animoſity againſt the Emperour. When I made this report unto <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> I adviſed her to ſeem, as if ſhe knew ſomething concerning <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and that perhaps would make her diſcover more. And it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:53526:209"/>
as I did imagine; for, being one night all three in the Cloſet of the Empreſſe, and <hi>Iſidore</hi> falling into her uſuall tears, <hi>Eudoxe</hi> ſeemed unto her, as if ſhe knew the cauſe; upon which, ſhe began to confeſſe unto us, the injury which the Emperour had done her, and fell into ſuch paſſionate expreſſions againſt him, as the fair <hi>Eudoxe</hi> could not chuſe, but accompany her in her tears. I did extreamly compaſſionate this good Lady, and I muſt confeſſe, that had it been any but the Emperour, I ſhould have offered her my hand and ſword, in revenge of the wrong do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>ld ſooner have dyed, then enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained any thought of ſuch a thing, or attempted any thing againſt him or his Eſtate. When they had condoled together a long while, and that I could ſpeak unto <hi>Eudoxe:</hi> Madam, ſaid I unto her, me-thinks you have now a good occaſion offered to make me the moſt happy man alive. How, anſwered ſhe? You may, my faireſt Princeſſe, ſaid I unto her, revenge your ſelfe, by the ſame armes you are injured, and do three or foure actions worthy of your ſelfe: Firſt, you will be revenged upon him that hath wronged you; next, you will give ſome ſatisfaction to your dear <hi>Iſidore;</hi> and you will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence me, and make me the moſt contented man upon earth. The wiſe <hi>Iſidore,</hi> who had not ſpoke a long time, by reaſon of her tears, did reply before the Empreſſe: Madam, (ſaid ſhe, and fell upon her knees) I proteſt unto you, I conceive, that this is the moſt juſt revenge and beſt, that I can any way receive; nor is it reaſonable, that he who does ſo ill requite a happineſſe, which the heavens have given him, ſhould enjoy it without the ſame meaſure that he uſeth unto others. Madam, he is unworthy of you, and you are unjuſt, if you continue any longer his: The injury which he hath done unto you, his ingratitude unto the Emperour your Father, the diſhonour he hath done unto your Houſe, and the affront put upon the miſerable <hi>Iſidore,</hi> whom you have heretofore loved, does invite you to grant the requeſt, which <hi>Urſaces</hi> makes unto you: What harm can come unto you by it? You do love this Cavalier, he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, none can ever know it, and you may this way ſweetly revenge an injury, which is any other way irreparable. The Empreſſe ſmiled, and anſwered us: Perſons that are interreſted, are not compleat judges; you do both of you adviſe me to a revenge, which will offend me much more then before: If the Emperour have committed a fault, 'tis true, I do receive an injury by it; but ſince I have not the diſpoſe of his actions, I am not culpable of his crime. Now ſhould I commit the ſame fault, I ſhould be culpable as well as he. Faireſt Princeſſe, (ſaid I, and interrupted her) there is a great deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the caſes; for, you ſhall never hear me complain of any force, which you have uſed upon me. I do believe, anſwered ſhe, that it would be an act of your free will; yet, let me tell you, that if you will be truly my Cavalier, you muſt make it an act againſt your will; for, that title does oblige you, to preſerve my honour as deerly as my life. Madam, anſwered I, I know not why you may not take this revenge, nor can I ſee which way it ſhould concern your honour, ſince none ſhall ever know it. If none do know it, anſwered ſhe, then where is the revenge, for that which is never known, nor reſented, is as if it never were? But, my Cavalier, I ſhould be glad of revenge, ſo it could be without any injury unto my ſelfe; and ſince this way cannot be, but upon that ſcore, let us talk no more of it, and turn our thoughts upon ſomething elſe. The wiſe diſcourſe of this great Princeſſe, did ſtop both our mouths; All we were able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer her, was, that ſhe deſerved a better Husband then <hi>Valentinian,</hi> or elſe, <hi>Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> a worſe Wife then <hi>Eudoxe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, the refuſall of this way of revenge, which perhaps had contented the minde of this offended Lady, was a cauſe, that <hi>Iſidore,</hi> never letting her Husband reſt, did continually ſolicite him to revenge the injury, which both he and ſhe had received. <hi>Maximus,</hi> who had not forgot it, but only ſeemed ſo, that he might the more home-ly execute his Deſigne, he ſtudied night and day which way he ſhould bring it to paſſe: At laſt, aiming at no leſſe revenge then the life of the Offender, he thought, that if he did attempt any thing againſt the Emperour, his Forces that were in the hands of <hi>Aetius,</hi> and the authority and prudence of that great Captain, might be his own ruine; therefore he thought it much conducible unto his deſigne, to take <hi>Aetius</hi> out of the world, and <hi>Valentinian</hi> being weak on that ſide, might be the more eaſily ruined: But when this courſe was reſolved upon, all the difficulty was, to execute it; for, the great
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:53526:210"/>
power of this valiant Commander was ſuch, as it was a very hard matter to hurt him by force; and his prudence and circumſpection was ſo great, that any policy could not deceive him. He thought therefore, that there could be no better inſtrument of his ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, then <hi>Valentinian</hi> himſelfe, whom he knew to be of a very jealous nature, guided by vile and unworthy perſons, and feared the very ſhadow of any danger. He addreſſed himſelfe unto <hi>Heracles,</hi> who ever ſince, as a ſecret puniſhment of heaven, did bear the marks of <hi>Iſidore</hi>'s nailes in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

That for his part, he concluded, that for the publick ſafty, it was expedient to baniſh him, not only out of the Empire, but out of the World, becauſe a man ſo ambitious as he was, would never be won, either by fair means or ſoul. <hi>Heracles,</hi> who was naturally puſillanimous and effeminate, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently very ſuſpitious and cruell, was eaſily perſwaded, that <hi>Aetius</hi> had ſome ill deſignes, and that it was requiſite he ſhould be prevented. In this opinion, after thanks unto <hi>Maximus,</hi> for his care of the Empire and publick good, he went unto <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian</hi> into whom he infuſed ſuch aprehenſions of great and ſudden danger, that he cauſed <hi>Aetius</hi> to be killed the very ſame day by his Eunuchs; an act, which rendred him ſo odious unto every one, as from that time, he almoſt ceaſed to be Emperour, being obeyed only as a Tyrant; and certainly, he ſound preſently after, that <hi>Prox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> a Roman Knight, anſwered him very truly, when he asked him, whether he had not done well in killing <hi>Aetius:</hi> As for that, (anſwered he) I leave it unto your own judgment; but I know very well, that your left hand hath cut off your right. For, <hi>Ait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> moved by the love of <hi>Honorica,</hi> who had ſent him her Picture, and being ill trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by her Brother, deſired to be out of his hands, and to marry this Barbarian King: Moreover, being exaſperated by his ambition, ſeeing his grand enemy <hi>Aetius</hi> dead, he put his Army into a poſture, and fell upon <hi>Italy</hi> ſo furiouſly, that our firſt Forces which oppoſed him were defeated, and none but Townes held head againſt him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt <hi>Aquilea,</hi> which, after a three years Siege, he took, and pulled it down to the ground. The <hi>Padoans</hi> at the ſame time, and a People called the <hi>Venteians,</hi> flying from the fury of <hi>Aetilas,</hi> retired themſelves into ſome little Iſles of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea, with their Wives, Children, and Goods, and all that was pretious unto them, where draining the Lakes and Mariſhes which they found there, did plant themſelves. At the firſt, they called the place <hi>Rialte,</hi> meaning, as I think, <hi>Rive-al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e,</hi> which ſignifies a high Bank, becauſe the place there is higher then the reſt. And ſince finding the place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, they reſted there, and afterwards called it <hi>Venice,</hi> and the Inhabitants <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</hi> As ſoon as <hi>Aquilea</hi> was demoliſhed, all thoſe that could ſave themſelves, did run to theſe Iſles which were about <hi>Rialte,</hi> and there built Guards. Thoſe of <hi>Concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Gaorly,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Altine Vorcelly;</hi> briefly, thoſe of <hi>Vincentia,</hi> of <hi>Breſſe,</hi> of <hi>Mantua,</hi> of <hi>Bergame,</hi> of <hi>Millaine,</hi> and of <hi>Pavia,</hi>
ſeeing how ſafely theſe firſt lived in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they retired thither alſo; and building together as well as they could, they became ſuch friends, that ſince, they make but one People, who being compoſed of ſeverall Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, could not agree upon the election of a King; but, to remove all jealouſie, did agree upon common Lawes, and began to live in the way of a republick, diſtinct, and ſeparate from the Empire.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why I have ſo long inſiſted upon this, is, becauſe all Aſtrologers, who have calculated the fate of theſe fugitives, do ſay, that never was Republick founded upon ſo happy a point as this; not for any great and large extent of Dominion, but for its long continuance, which ſeemes, as if it would never have an end, untill all things

Theſe Iſles do not now appear to be Iſles, but a great City, built upon an infinite number of Bridges; the Sea is their ſtreets, which running through in ſo many parts with ſo much art is admirable as well as their originall.

                  </gap> from whence I digreſſed, after <hi>Attilas</hi> had taken <hi>Aquilea,</hi> he made towards <hi>Rome:</hi> and doubtleſſe had ſacked it, if <hi>Valentinian</hi> for want of corrage had not rendred himſelfe Tributary; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented that his Siſter <hi>Honorica,</hi> ſhould be his wife. But this diſhonorable peace being made, he retired into <hi>Pannonia,</hi> where upon his marriage night, and after abundance of wine and banquet, being gone to bed he was found dead in it, in the morning Some ſaid it was by bleeding at the noſe which choaked him: others, that he was killed by one of his wives: which way ſoever it was, he dyed the very night of his marriage eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Empire, by this meane, both of feare and Tribute. <hi>Valentinian</hi> in this neceſſity, found what a fault he had committed in killing <hi>Aetius,</hi> having not one Captaine that could ſtop this Barbarian nor any that cared for doing him ſervice, ſince he had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelfe ſo bad a pay maſter. For my part, I was aſhamed to be in <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſee things in ſuch ſtrange deſolation; and would have tryed to have ruined my ſelfe with it, had I not by <hi>Valentinians</hi> and <hi>Eudoxes</hi> command beene ſent unto the Emperour <hi>Marcian</hi> to demand ayde, as ſoone as <hi>Aquilea</hi> was beſieged: but I found <hi>Marcian</hi> very faint towards <hi>Valentinian,</hi> as well becauſe of <hi>Aetius</hi> his death, as becauſe <hi>Attiles</hi> ſent him word, that his coming into <hi>Italy</hi> was onely to obtaine <hi>Honorica,</hi> with whom he was in love. And knowing that <hi>Valentinian</hi> did obſtinately deny her unto him, he would not relieve him in this neceſſity into which he had brought himſelfe by his ill government, and without reaſon. Whileſt I was negotiating this buſineſſe, I fell ſo ſicke, that every one left me for dead and ſome told <hi>Eudoxe</hi> that they ſaw me buried. You may imagine how ſhe mourned for me: for I may truly ſay that never any loved more then ſhe me: my diſeaſe was very dangerous being a ſpotted Fever and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in it, above eight moneths, and a friend of mine did write unto <hi>Iſdore</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating my condition, for I was not able to write my ſelfe. In concluſion, having ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Conſtaninople</hi> ſome eighteene or twenty months to no purpoſe, I reſolved to take ſhip for <hi>Ravenna,</hi> where <hi>Valentinian</hi> was retreated with <hi>Eudoxe</hi> for his ſafety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Italy,</hi> being thus ſettled in peace <hi>Petronius Maximus</hi> the husband of wiſe <hi>Iſidore.</hi> began to think upon his revenge, all things ſeeming to ſecond his deſigne. He was a man of great Authority in the Empire; For he was Patriarch, and having a deſigne of revenge, and happily to make himſelfe Emperour, he had long beforehand gotten the love of the people and the Souldier; of the one by his liberality for he was very rich; and of the other by his popularity in ſeconding all requeſts which was made for the eaſe and freedome of the people. And to render <hi>Valentinian</hi> odious unto every one, he adviſed him ſecretly not to recompence the Souldiers either with honours or benefits, and to lay ſuch a load of taxes upon the people, as ſhould alwayes keepe them poore, and unable to attempt any novelty; and the better to accompliſh his deſigne, he exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated all the friends of the great <hi>Aetius,</hi> as much as poſſible he could, and courted himſelfe into intimat familiarity with them. The Emperour never doubted of any of theſe things, for he knew <hi>Maximus</hi> was of opinion that it was beſt to ruine <hi>Aetius:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it was now ſo long ſince the murder was committed, that he beleeved every one had forgotten it. And as for his injury done unto the wiſe <hi>Iſidore,</hi> he beleeved ſhe had not acquainted her husband with it, ſince in ſo many yeares he never made ſhew of any diſcontent Briefly, he lived in ſuch a careleſſe ſecurity, that he permitted the greateſt friends of <hi>Aetius</hi> to be about his perſon. Which <hi>Maximus</hi> having long obſerved, and ſeeking for a meanes how to ſatisfie the wiſe <hi>Iſidore,</hi> who was continually putting him in minde of it, one day taking <hi>Thraſiles</hi> apart who was one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt friends which <hi>Aetius</hi> had, and who then had the guard of the Emperours perſon, he ſet before his eyes the untimely death of his freind, and the careleſſneſſe of <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> intimating what an eaſie matter it was to take revenge upon him; in ſo much as he moulded him unto his owne will: And not being content with revenge only, he went further, and reſolved to uſurpe the Empire: <hi>Maximus</hi> told <hi>Thraſiles</hi> that when

this was come to paſſe, he ſhould find full ſatisfaction and contentment. This reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being taken, it was not long before it was put in execution: For <hi>Thraſiles</hi> had the opportunity when he would, being alwayes neere the perſon of the Emperour.

                  </gap>irty yeares. Had I been neere his perſon at that time, doubtleſs I had dyed in defence of him: For though the act which he had committed againſt <hi>Iſidore</hi> was wicked; yet there can be no cauſe whatſoever, for lifting up a hand againſt a Soveraine. Adviſe one may, but never chaſtiſe, much leſſe take that life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, which to ſave he ought to loſe his owne. I was then at the ſacrifice with the faire <hi>Eudixe,</hi> where the tumult was ſo great, that for ſafety of herſelfe ſhe was forced to go out of <hi>Rome.</hi> For <hi>Maximus</hi> having committed this homicide he knew that wickedneſſe muſt never be done by halves; and therefore finding the power in his hands, by the meanes of <hi>Thraſiles,</hi> and ſome whoſe friendſhip he had gotten, and alſo being aſſured of the peoples conſent, he preſently cauſed himſelfe to be elected and proclaimed Emperour: and all this without the leaſt oppoſition though the Towne was full of tumult. <hi>Iſidore</hi> was preſently advertiſed of it, both by her husband, &amp; by the common report of <hi>Valentinians</hi> death. And ſhe had ſuch an inveterate hatred of him, that ſhe could not believe unleſs ſhe ſaw him dead. Therfore ſhe left her houſe &amp; went to the Palace, and ſeeing his corps without a head, ſhe waſht her hands in his blood, &amp; received ſuch a ſtrange contentment in his death, that for very exceſſe of joy, ſhe fell downe dead. I was then, as I told you, with the faire <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> and would not leave her in ſuch a dyſaſtrous fortune; but waited upon her whither ſoever ſhe pleaſed, in teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my affection and fidelity. The haſte we made was ſuch, that we hardly tooke any with us. And loſing our way in the night we were forced to take up lodging in a wood: She had none with her but her two Daughters, <hi>Olimbres,</hi> and two young men who uſually followed us, and who were much troubled in looking to our horſes: So as there was none with her all the night but theſe two young Princeſſes; <hi>Olimbres,</hi> and my ſelfe. I did lye downe upon the ground, and ſhe laid her head upon my breaſt, her two Daughters lay at her feet; and thus paſſed away the night as well as we could. Our intention was to get out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and to go unto <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to <hi>Marcianus:</hi> For ſince <hi>Maximus</hi> had killed the Emperor, and had taken upon him the title of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> we feared he would be revenged upon her for the injury done unto <hi>Iſidore.</hi>
Though the night was very dark, and ſad to the faire <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> yet I muſt confeſſe it was the ſweeteſt night unto me, that ever I had in my life: for I had my hand conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in her boſome, and her lips cloſe unto mine. Love knowes how I was thus tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported, and how oft I was ready to caſt off all reſpect. Which ſhe perceiving, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Daughters to be both aſleep, ſhe whiſpered me in my eare, and ſaid thus unto me: Fie, fie, my Cavalier, do you think the gods are not enough incenſed againſt me, but you muſt needs provoke them more by mooving me to commit freſh offences? After this ſhe was ſilent, and giving me a kiſs, ſhe laid her head where it was before: this was a ſufficient teſtimony that ſhe loved me, and after this favour I laid my mouth unto her eare, and ſaid thus unto her. But, my faireſt Princeſſe, what offence would it be, ſince now you are nobodies but your owne? Would you have me ſtay untill ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall enjoy you before my face? Is it poſſible you ſhould reſerve your ſelfe for one who never loved you, or for one that can never love you ſo well as I? Then ſhe ſet her mouth unto my eare: My Cavalier, (ſaid ſhe unto me) do not offer to offend againſt god or my honour: and, to put you out of all theſe doubts, receive this Vow. I doe vow and ſweare unto you <hi>Urſaces,</hi> by the great god whom I adore, that I will never marry any man but you: and if what I have been, would permit me freely to diſpoſe of my ſelfe, I would take you to my husband this very houre: I do beleeve your affection ſuch unto me that after I have been Empreſſe you would not have me hold a leſſe degree: Fortune perhaps will ſo diſpoſe of you, that I may with honour give you contentment, and then, curſe me if I prove falſe. In the meane time, live with this ſatisfaction, that I will never marry any but you: and for aſſurance of what I ſweare, take this kiſs, and then joyning her lips to mine, ſhe continued very long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: Judge, kind ſtranger, whether I did receive the oathes with all my heart,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:53526:211"/>
ſince I never deſired any thing more paſſionately. Then I anſwered her thus: My fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Princeſs, I receive this promiſe with ſuch a thankfull heart, and affectionate ſoul that in exchange I do entirely give you my ſelfe. And I do vowe and proteſt that I will never revoke my gift: but give me leave to ſweare by that great God, before whom you have made this promiſe that if ever it happen with your conſent or otherwiſe, that any one do enjoy you as a husband, I will kill him with the ſame hand which now you hold in yours: Unto which ſhe ſaid in mine eare, I ſhall hold you for a faint hearted Traitor, if you do not: After this, ſhe laid downe her head, and we paſſed away the night as we begun it: But alas I did not long enjoy this happineſſe of being with her, no more then my friend. <hi>Olimbres</hi> the happineſſe of being with <hi>Placidia:</hi> For the next morning, the Tyrant <hi>Maximus</hi> hearing that <hi>Eudoxe</hi> and her two Daughters were eſcaped, he ſent ſo many men ſeveral wayes, as at the laſt they found us, and carryed us back, do what <hi>Olimbres</hi> and I could in defence of ourſelves: Who after ſeverall wounds, and I more then <hi>Olimbres,</hi> we were carryed to this Tyrant: who not being contented with the murder of <hi>Valentinian</hi> and uſurping the Empire, but would take a full revenge or rather a confirmation of his uſurpation, and, to give it a gloſſe, would marry the faire <hi>Eudoxe:</hi> Oh heavens? what would ſhe not have done to prevent it? But, Oh heavens! how did I reſent it? I was ſo wounded both in my thigh and in my right arme, that I was not able to ſtirre out of my bed: ſo as I was diſabled from doing her any ſervice. In concluſion, the Tyrant ſeeing that <hi>Eudoxe</hi> would not conſent unto his will by faire meanes, he uſed her ſo coorſly that within twelve dayes after the death of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> he forced <hi>Eudoxe</hi> to be his wife. I heard the newes of it by <hi>Olimbres</hi> who was already recovered, and who never ſtirred from my beds ſide. And when I knew not how to judge of this Act, but was in doubt of <hi>Eudoxes</hi> conſent, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Letter from her which was this.</p>

If you permit me to lament my ſad fortune to ſee my ſelfe in his hands, who hath ſo unjuſtly raviſhed me from you, I ſhall curſe you, and accuſe you with want of affection: Keep therefore your word as I will mine, and let ſate do her worſt.</hi>

               <p>What attempts would I not have dared, if my power had been equall to my will? or if my wounds had permitted me? But alas I was in a condition farre unfit to do any thing to another, when I was not able to run my ſelfe through with my ſword, when I heard <hi>Eudoxe</hi> was to be enjoyed by a Tyrant: and but for <hi>Olimbres,</hi> perhaps I had ſerved my owne turne, for he was ſo carefull of me that I could not do any thing to my ſelfe; but gave me ſo many diverting reaſons to the contrary, that he kept me alive nine or tenne dayes till I was ſo happy as to ſee the wiſe and faire <hi>Eudoxe</hi> enter into my chamber. She had obtained this leave of <hi>Maximus,</hi> telling him it was but reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to ſee him who had been wounded in her defence: <hi>Maximus</hi> who deſired to gaine me by faire meanes if poſſible, and having no ſuſpition of me, ſo handſomely did we carry the matter, and ſo diſcreet and faithfull was <hi>Iſidore</hi> unto her Miſtreſſe, that <hi>Maximus</hi> permitted her. So ſhe came to ſee me, and leaving all her followers at the dore, ſhe brought with her none but the little Princeſſe <hi>Placidia,</hi> knowing that <hi>Olimbres</hi> would ſo entertaine her in diſcourſe, as ſhe would not mind what ſhe ſaid. She came to my beds ſide, and ſitting downe offered to ſpeake, but could not: At laſt ſeeing teares flowe from mine eyes, and that I was not able to utter one word, ſhe turned herſelfe, ſo that none ſhould obſerve our griefe. Thus ſilently we ſat along while; and ſpoke not one word. At laſt having tooke a little courage I ſpoke theſe words. For ought I ſee Madam, there is none loſers by the bargain but <hi>Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Urſaces:</hi> He in loſing his life his Empire and his wife: and I the favour of the faire <hi>Eudoxe.</hi> But alas his loſſe is nothing unto mine, for being dead he has loſt all ſenſibility of
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:53526:212"/>
miſery, and I that am alive can onely be called miſerable becauſe I do reſent my miſery. She anſwered me, firſt with her teares which ſhe could not reſtraine, and then by her words: Will you, my Cavalier, help to augment my griefe, and in lieu of giving me ſome comfort and pitty, will you by your reproaches make me more miſerable? But it is well done; I am contented to be killed, ſince I ſee <hi>Urſaces</hi> does not love me. Oh heavens, cryed I, as loud as I could, being offended at her words, and ſorry I had cryed ſo loud, for two or three came running to me to know what I ayled, to whom I anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that my wounds pained, (but the paine was gone) and when they were gone alſo I began to ſpeake againe. How Madam? Does not <hi>Urſaces</hi> love you? Can you ſay it, and not bluſh? are you not afraid the heavens will puniſh you for the wrong you do me? <hi>Urſaces</hi> not love you Madam? how long have you knowne him changed? was it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Valentinian</hi> dyed? No, you have writ the contrary. Was it ſince his death? No ſurely, you cannot chuſe but remember my vowes and promiſe. But perhaps it is ſince the wrong you have done me in giving your ſelfe unto this cruell Tyrant. If ſo, tis time indeed to change my miſerable life for a happy death: but you may thank <hi>Olim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi> that I live, for he onely has hindred me from dying. But ſince I live, you may be certaine, that you ſhall live no longer then till I recover ſo much ſtrength as to take a life away: though you do not love me yet you might well have rendred me ſome teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of pitty. But what pitty or compaſſion can I expect from the wife of a Tyrant? how can I ever think you any thing but a peece of ingratitude? if you would live and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy your tyranicall husband: do you your ſelfe reach me my ſword, that you may ſave your own life and his, and ſee that it is not want of will but ſtrength that keeps me alive. She not being able to endure I ſhould continue any longer, coming neerer anſwered me thus In ſaying that <hi>Valentinian</hi> and you are the only loſers, you might very wel have put me into the number, for ſince you do not love me, my loſs is the greateſt of all: Did I not feare our diſcourſe would be obſerved, I would ſay more, and ſweare that I love none but you, and beſeech you to beleeve that as you are kept alive by force, ſo revenge keeps me, for I do not take this <hi>Maximus</hi> either for husband or Emperour; but for the moſt cruell Tyrant that ever was in <hi>Rome:</hi> Were it not in deſire and hopes of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, I would not live a minute, and ſee you thus wounded. But heaven which is juſt does promiſe me revenge for the blood of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and for the wrong which is done unto <hi>Urſaces</hi> and the miſerable <hi>Eudoxe.</hi> In the meane time (my Cavalier) take corrage and recover of your wounds as ſoone as you can, for there is no other meanes to come unto our deſired ends, but that. This declaration was comfort enough to my ſoul, in ſo much as I recovered of my wounds very ſuddainly: For this time, ſhe would ſay no more, but went away, to prevent all ſuſpition of our deſigne. But about three or four dayes after, ſhe came to ſee me againe, told me the manner how <hi>Maximus</hi> had killed <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and how he intended to marry her, as he ſaid himſelfe, at which ſhe was ſo extreamly offended as ſhe reſolved to diſpatch him ſome way or other, out of the world. Oh my Princeſſe, (ſaid I unto her) you muſt do nothing imprudently, for if you once failn your enterpriſe, you can never after hope to attempt it without abundance of danger to your ſelfe; beſides, you would do me very great wrong, if you employ any other hand but mine in the blood of him who is the Parricide of my Soveraine, and the raviſher of you. This is the courſe which I conceive beſt to be taken: <hi>Valentinian,</hi> long before <hi>Attilas</hi> turned his armes againſt <hi>Italy,</hi> had concluded a peace with <hi>Genſerick</hi> King of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and left all that he had in <hi>Affrica</hi> unto him, upon condition he ſhould be his friend and confederate. This Barbarian hath ever ſince made great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of love unto the Emperour, and would never take part with any that were his enemyes: Make knowne unto him the wicked machinations of <hi>Maximus;</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with the murder of <hi>Valentinian;</hi> ſhew him how he hath uſurped the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: complaine unto him of the force he offereth unto you, and ſummon him unto the promiſe upon which <hi>Affrica</hi> is his: Feare not but he will relieve you: for though he be a Barbarian, yet he is generous, and it is their Nationall vertue to keep promiſe unto death, and more unto the dead then unto their loving friends: Now, to make ſure work, becauſe all theſe Barbarians are naturally greedy and covetous, offer him the Empire, that he may be more eager upon it: tell him what friends and meanes you can make for him in <hi>Italy.</hi> And that you are able to make his way eaſy unto him, by the aſſiſtance of thoſe who are adherents unto you againſt the murderer of the Emperor: now though I
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:53526:212"/>
muſt need ſay, it is hard to endure, that any Barbarian ſhould ever Lord it in <hi>Italy;</hi> yet better ſo, then to be without revenge. <hi>Eudixe</hi> conſidering a while upon what I ſaid, did anſwer me, that all the difficulty in the buſineſſe would be, how to treat ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly and ſpeedily with this Barbarian, that he might be in <hi>Italy</hi> before it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; and conſidering my preſent condition, ſhe knew not whom to employ, that would be quick enough in the expedition; that ſhe had rather die a hundred deaths, then ever Bed with this Tyrant; that ſhe could put it off a while, by counterfeiting ſickneſſe, but that could not be long. I adviſed her to continue her counterfeiting and the better to delude the eyes of thoſe who ſaw her, that ſhe ſhould every morning uſe the ſome of Brimſtone to her face and hands, which would make her look ſo pale, that every one would believe her really ſick. As for diſpatching into <hi>Affrica,</hi> it was my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be in ſuch a caſe, that I could not; and beſides, I had made a vow never to go out of <hi>Italy,</hi> untill I had killed the Tyrant: But that ſhe might very well truſt my dear friend <hi>Olimbres,</hi> who, I was ſure, would be both faithfull and diligent in her commands, and that I would anſwer for his fidelity and capacity. She, who deſired nothing more then revenge, and to be out of this Tyrants power, referred the whole management unto me, and deſired me to diſpatch him with inſtructions, which I did; and <hi>Olimbres</hi> ſhewed himſelfe ſo wiſe and diligent, that within fifteen daies he arrived at <hi>Carthage,</hi> negotiated ſo with <hi>Genſerick,</hi> as he diſpoſed him unto Revenge, unto Uſurpation, and to the Plunder of <hi>Rome;</hi> inſomuch as within two months after, he ſet foot in <hi>Italy,</hi> with three hundred thouſand fighting men, compoſed of <hi>Affricans, Moors,</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> which put ſuch a terrour into the City and all the Province, that every one fled to the Mountains, Woods, and Rocks. And becauſe we did ſolicite him to come ſtraight to <hi>Rome,</hi> that he might take the Tyrant, he made all the haſte that poſſible he could, without any halt, or ſtay in any Townes by the way.</p>
               <p>This put <hi>Maximus</hi> into ſuch a fright, as without ſeeking to make any reſiſtance, he permitted every one to ſhift for themſelves as well as they could, and for his part, he fled into the Mountains with the reſt. I was by this time well recovered of my wounds; and had not the fair <hi>Eudoxe</hi> charged me to the contrary, I had executed my deſigne; but ſhe ſtill reſtrained me, untill for more ſafety, the <hi>Vandal</hi> was neerer the Town. But now, ſeeing that in lieu of defending his uſurped Eſtate, he left it as a prey unto the Barbarians, I was affraid leſt he ſhould ſave himſelfe, and that when <hi>Genſerick</hi> had left <hi>Italy,</hi> he would then returne againe unto his Tyranny. This was the reaſon why I followed after him, with ſome of my friends, and overtook him upon the banks of <hi>Tiber;</hi> and though moſt of my Company was tired out, yet I reſolved to charge him, and let him go no farther. I challenged him therefore, and charged him with his wickedneſſe, in the death of the Emperour, in the uſurpation of <hi>Italy,</hi> and in the force uſed againſt <hi>Eudoxe;</hi> and being guilty of all, he refuſed to fight with me, but ſpurred away as faſt as he could: At which his own men were ſo aſhamed and animated, that all joyning with my friends, they rid after him, and by chance, my Horſe having better heeles then the reſt, I firſt overtook him, and gave him ſuch a blow upon the head, that he fell to the ground, where thoſe that came after me, diſpatched him out-right, ſo much was every one incenſed againſt him, for his perfidie and cowardiſe. Thus ended this Tyrant, ſo hated by his own men, as when he was dead, they cut him in pieces, and threw him into the River, as if they would waſh away his crimes in that manner; but all the water in the River <hi>Tiber</hi> could not waſh away halfe of thoſe which he had committed, againſt the Emperour, againſt the fair <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> and againſt the State.</p>
               <p>I have hitherto related the miſerable accidents which befell <hi>Eudoxe</hi> and me but theſe which I have now to relate, are much more dyſaſtrous; for alas; they have brought me into this miſerable condition in which you ſee me. Now did <hi>Genſerick</hi> enter the City and he found no reſiſtance, not ſo much as a dore ſhut againſt him. <hi>Eudoxe</hi> received him, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him the title of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and telling him, that the Empire owed their liberty unto him; and, briefly, did him all the honour, and gave him all the thanks, that was poſſible. But this Barbarian, in lieu of being more gentle and affable by theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, they made him more haughty and intolerable; In lieu of friendſhip, he proved an enemy, and carried himſelfe, not as a Prince who came to relieve a diſtreſſed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:53526:213"/>
but as a Conquerour, who by force of Armes, after a long War, had conquered an enemies Country. He gave up the Towne for plunder, and making no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſacred and prophane things, he pillaged the Temples of all their Veſſells and Treaſures, and of all thoſe Rarities, which the people and Roman Emperours for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages, had, out of their devotion, preſented unto them. And after this ſad confuſion had laſted fifteen daies, he ran over moſt part of <hi>Italy,</hi> till he came to <hi>Parthenopea,</hi> where he did nothing but waſte and ſpoile the Country; and when he was even glutted with ſpoile and rapine, he returned into <hi>Affrica,</hi> having loadned his Ships with the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and rarities that he found in the City. But alas, not being contented with theſe inanimate things, he raviſhed away with him ſuch perſons, as he thought might be uſefull to him, and amongſt the reſt, Oh heavens! he carried away the fair <hi>Eudoxe</hi> and her two Daughters, <hi>Eudoxe</hi> and <hi>Placidia:</hi> I was then cloſe by this deſolate Princeſſe, when he ſent her word, that ſhe was to prepare for her departure within three daies after: She fell into a ſwound at the meſſage, and was very neer death; but I wiſh to heaven, that ſhe and I had both dyed, rather then carried captives into <hi>Affrica.</hi> Oh heavens, how can I remember this accident and live? I went out of <hi>Rome</hi> with ſome of my friends, not acquainting any with my deſigne, not ſo much as my deer friend <hi>Olimbres,</hi> with whom I could not ſpeak when I went, becauſe he was with <hi>Genſerick,</hi> who had taken him into his friendſhip, ſince his <hi>Affrican</hi> voyage, and who by <hi>Eudoxe</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand never ſtirred from him that he might ſave the Town as much as poſſible; ſo as at his requeſt, he did many favours unto ſeverall perſons. I ſent afterwards to him, to the end he ſhould aſſure <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> that I would either get her out of theſe barbarous hande or die. She, who had a very ſolid and ſound judgment, did know very well, that my enterpriſe was impoſſible by reaſon of that numerous body of men that <hi>Genſerick</hi> brought with him, which exceeded the number of three hundred thouſand men: Had ſhe known where I was, doubtleſſe ſhe had kept me from executing my deſigne; but, leſt I ſhould be ſurpriſed by the <hi>Vandals,</hi> I never ſtayed a whole night in a place I had rallied together about a thouſand Horſe, and if I had had a little more time perhaps I had got up ſuch an Army, as ſhould have eaſed theſe Barbarians of our ſpoils, which they were carrying into <hi>Affrica,</hi> or at leaſt, ſhould have felt the weight of a Roman Arme; but I had only eight daies time. And not being able to endure they ſhould car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> I reſolved to fight this great and terrible Army, with this little hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of men, thinking my life could not end upon a more noble account, nor in a better cauſe. Having ambuſcado'd my ſelfe in a Wood, neer the way of <hi>Hoſtia,</hi> I ſaw ſome part of this great Army march in very bad order; but my aime being only at <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> I kept my ſelfe ſtill cloſe, till I ſaw ſome Chariots comming, in which I perceived ſome Ladies; and ſuppoſing them to be the ſame I did expect, I encouraged my men, telling them, that this would be an act worthy of a Roman name. Upon ſetting ſpurs to my Horſe, and they moſt couragiouſly following me, we charged theſe Chariots, whoſe Guard was above ten thouſand <hi>Barbarians.</hi> I ſhal not relate the paſſage of this charge, for it is impertinent: But ſo it was that we routed them; and had <hi>Eudoxe</hi> been there, as I thought ſhe was doubtleſſe I had delivered her out of theſe barbarous hands: but, as ill luck was ſhe was ſtill behinde; and thoſe Ladies which I ſaw, were ſuch, as had been taken in the City and Country, and were to be carried with the reſt of the Booty into <hi>Affrica.</hi> Oh heavens! how was I grieved, when I ſaw my ſelfe thus miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? and had all the Army on my back; for, upon this Tumult, the Vanguard recoyled, and the Reerguard advanced and drew into Battalia; ſo as I was environed on all ſides with ſo great a number of enemies, as we could expect nothing but ruine: Some ran away, others ſtayed; for my part I laid me down amongſt the dead, and was ſtripped of my clothes as they were; and it was happy for me, for my clothes being carried by a Souldier, <hi>Eudoxe</hi> knew them and ſhewed them unto <hi>Olimbres,</hi> who would not leave her. All that ſhe ſaid, was: I ſee, <hi>Urſaces,</hi> at the laſt hath met with that Reſt, which Fortune ever denyed him. Upon this expreſſion, ſhe ſwouned in her Chariot. <hi>Olimbres</hi> running after him who had my clothes, he asked where he got them; and being told the place, he went preſently unto it, and ſought till he found me; how ſad was he, when he ſaw me! However, he got leave of the <hi>Vandal,</hi> to do me the laſt office of buriall: He would needs return to <hi>Rome,</hi> and have me carried alſo upon Boughs. I was ſo jogged
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:53526:213"/>
in the carriage, that I gave ſome ſignes of life. <hi>Olimbres</hi> ſeeing this, was beyond all meaſure glad, and brought me into the firſt houſe they came unto, where I received ſuch Cordialls, as I recovered out of my long ſwoun. You may imagine, <hi>Silvander,</hi> how glad I was, when carrying my friend to his grave, I found him alive; thoſe who ſaw me did plainly ſee, that his life was as deer unto me as my own; yet, we had both been happy had we ended our daies then, for then I ſhould not have grieved at the abſence and raviſhment of the fair <hi>Eudoxe,</hi> nor <hi>Olimbres,</hi> at parting from his dear <hi>Placidia.</hi> This conſideration made me reſolve upon death, as ſoon as I heard this perſidious <hi>Genſerick</hi> had carried <hi>Eudoxe</hi> and her two Daughters away; but the great care which my friend had of me, kept me from the execution of my deſigne, as long as my wounds kept me in bed. But when I had recovered my ſelfe of theſe wounds, and was able to get upon a Horſe, I ſtole away as ſecretly as poſſibly I could from him; and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the way towards <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> I hid my ſelf in the <hi>Appennine</hi> Mountaines, intending to die with hunger or ſome ſuch hardſhip, not being willing to ſhed my blood, for fear of offending the great god, who puniſheth Homicides. At the laſt, the languiſhment of this life, made me reſolve upon a more ſudden death; and when, caſting off all conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of heaven, I would have run my ſword to my heart, my dear <hi>Olimbres</hi> came, and ſtayed my arme, ſo by this means, gave me a life the ſecond time. Then afterwards, when I ſtill perſiſted in my reſolution to effect my intentions, a young man came in, whoſe beauty and wiſdome did make us think, that comming in ſuch a nick of time, he was ſome meſſenger ſent from god, purpoſely to divert me from my deſigne. I muſt confeſſe, that at the firſt I thought him ſo, and was ſo obedient to his words, that I had no minde to kill my ſelfe, hoping to receive from him ſome ſupernaturall aid; ſo as being thus deceived, we all three went unto the next Town, to get <hi>Olimbres</hi> dreſſed of a great wound which I gave him, when he offered to take the ſword out of my hand, where with I would have killed my ſelfe. But when I underſtood, that this young man was a <hi>Seguſian,</hi> as you are, and that he came to the place where I was, by meer chance, I confeſſe, I took a ſtronger reſolution of dying then before, and doubtleſſe had, but for this young man, whoſe name was <hi>Celadon,</hi> as afterwards he told me, who uſed ſuch ſtrong arguments, and gave me ſuch good reaſons, that I reſolved to ſtay till the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of <hi>Olimbres.</hi> There was in this place an old and grave Chirurgeon, (who dreſſed the wound of my friend) whoſe age and travells in ſeverall Countries, had got him great knowledge and experience: this man took ſpeciall notice of our ſorrowes; and as one word may ſometimes diſcover what we deſire to keep ſecret; ſo I did not ſo well diſſemble the matter, but he did partly ſuſpect my deſigne; ſo as one day he took me aſide, and ſaid thus unto me: Think it not ſtrange, Sir, that I, unasked, intrude my ſelfe to give you ſome counſell; my age, your merit, and my duty to god, invites me to it; take therefore in good part what I ſhall ſay. I know, that you are ſeized with extream ſorrowes, and that you have a deſigne againſt your own life. Do not offer it, for god, after your death, will moſt ſeverely puniſh all murderers of themſelves. And beſides, to kill ones ſelfe, argues a defect in courage, as if you durſt not look a dyſaſter in the face; and as thoſe who fly for fear of their enemies, ſo ſuch as kill themſelves for fear of any dyſaſter, do flye out of the world for want of courage, and becauſe they dare not abide one of fortune's blowes. God hath given unto man judgment and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to make his election by ſolid and ſound reaſon; and becauſe man, being poſſeſſed with paſſion, can neither judge nor chuſe aright, he hath given him a communicative ſoul, to the end that making choice of one or more friends, he may ask counſell of them, in all matters of importance. And becauſe friends are very often intereſted in their friends buſineſſe, this god, not leaving man without a good guide, hath given him Judges and Kings, to order and decide all manner of doubts and controverſies.</p>
               <p>This great Creator of men, loving them as his Children, would furniſh them with all that is neceſſary both to live and to die; and to that end hath inſpired the <hi>Maſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> to conſtitute prudent Judges; it ſeeming unto them, that death is no injury, but a tribute of nature, and therefore it would be unjuſtly done to deny that remedy unto ſuch, as with reaſon do demand it: And therefore they have erected a publick Theater in their City, where they uſe to keep poyſon, and will give it unto him to drink, who ſhall deſire to die, if it be ſo, that the Councell of ſix hundred do adjudge that his reaſons why he deſires death; be good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="422" facs="tcp:53526:214"/>
I do hint this unto you, Sir, that if you be oppreſſed with any ſad dyſaſter, you may rid your ſelfe from the tyranny of it, by the judgment of ſo many, worthy, wiſe, and prudent perſons. For my part, becauſe you ſhall not think I give you ſuch coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, as I will not take my ſelfe, I am reſolved within theſe few daies to make my addreſſe unto them, being incited thereunto by a contrary opinion unto yours; for, I have lived along age, full foureſcore and nineteen years, in great felicity, according to my rank and quality; rich, in the gifts of fortune, above any of my profeſſion; happy in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, beloved of my Neighbours, eſteemed of every one; and as I have lived, ſo I would die happily; I would not ſtay ſo long, as untill my hundreth year, leſt I ſhould tempt ſome dyſaſter, to make me die miſerable; having learned, that if <hi>Priamas</hi> had dyed a little before the loſſe of his Town, he had been the greateſt Prince of all <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This good old man uſed this language unto me, which had no ſmall operation upon my thoughts; for, as ſoon as I came to <hi>Olimbres,</hi> I made this relation unto him: and the reſult was, that we would all three for company go unto this place, and put an end unto our daies. But heaven would not have it ſo, for he dyed when you relieved us. Theſe two Women which you ſaved, were his two Daughters, who came along with him, to cloſe his eyes, if the Councell of Six Hundred had granted him the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. We thought our ſelves obliged to aſſiſt them, and not to forſake them, till they had found the Corps of their dead Father, and given their laſt duty unto him, who never had any misfortune in his life; and to the end, that after his death he might be happy alſo, in being interred by the hands of his own Children.</p>
               <p>But to return unto that which concernes us. We were fully reſolved to proſecute our deſigne, and to make it appear, that it was not the loſſe of Eſtate, or ſhipwrack, or any ſuch, did move our wills unto it, being very rich, and owners of great poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, we ſent unto our houſes for our ſervants to come unto us, with a conſiderable ſumme of many.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Urſaces</hi> ended, moving me infinitely to compaſſionate his fortune and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe</hi>'s. And having anſwered, that I have ſeen many, who had petitioned the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Six Hundred for this poyſon, and that it was granted unto ſome, and refuſed unto others. He deſired in all favour to keep it ſecret, leſt ſome friend unto <hi>Maximus</hi> ſhould prevent them, and hinder their death. Then he asked me, how the Requeſt or Petition uſed to be preſented, in what termes, and what ceremonies were uſed. To which I anſwered, that the thing was very eaſy; one to addreſſe himſelfe unto a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, eſpecially appointed to receive ſuch Petitions: That he would make report of it unto the Councell of Six Hundred: That none ever uſed to name themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there ſhould be no reſpect of perſons, and the Petition muſt be in this Forme.</p>

               <p>They deſired a Copy of this, to the end they might not miſtake; and having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed one unto them, I continued.

When I had ſpoken theſe laſt words, I plainly ſaw by the tears of <hi>Urſaces,</hi> that he did deſire death; but I perceived, that <hi>Olimbres</hi> was invited unto it, only out of affection unto his Companion, from whom he would never part.</p>

After a few dayes, thus ſpent, their ſervants came unto them out of <hi>Italy</hi> being many in number, and bringing abundance of riches with them. All things being then in ready<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they entreated me to accompany them before the Judges, and to do them this laſt and lamentable office. Which I did with much ſorrow, for I loved them, and was afraid the Councell would think their requeſt juſt. They preſented their Petitions, and were aſſigned the third day after; for that was the terme which was given them, in which they might change their minds. But <hi>Urſaces</hi> was conſtant, and reſolute in his opinion: and with <hi>Olimbres</hi> preſented themſelves both being very well habited and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: And being called before the Councell, they were asked their reaſons, why they would dye; <hi>Urſaces</hi> briefly anſwered thus.</p>

For loving him above all the world, all the world is nothing to me if he leave it. Amity is nothing but an union of two wills; and I do not love him, ſhould I conſent unto a diſunion. It is againſt the duty of any man of honor, to ceaſe loving, where once he is with reaſon fixed: all reaſon conſtraines me to this amity: for he is tranſcendently vertuous: an unparalelled friend, and I owe him my life. Were it not an abſurd contradiction of reaſon, if I ſhould faile in poynt of friendſhip? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, grave and wiſe Sirs, ſince heaven has ordained you for a comfort unto the afflicted, deny not this remedy unto me, leſt you ſhould contradict your owne lawes and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which you have for many ages adjudged to be ſo juſt and ſacred.</p>

               <p>Every one admired the reſolution of this conſtant friend. The Councell, after a long debate was in doubt whether they ſhould grant or deny their demands, untill the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall of the Councell by the advice of them all, asked <hi>Urſaces,</hi> whether he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his friend to dye?

Have you (ſaid the <hi>Maſsilian)</hi> permiſſion from the Lady that you love, to dye becauſe you are not able to relieve her? I have not (anſwered <hi>Urſaces)</hi> for I never ſaw her ſince this misfortune happened: But I dare aſſure you, that her generous heart would conſent unto it; and if ſhe were in my place ſhe would make the ſame requeſt which I do.

                           <p>UPon the requeſt preſented unto us by theſe two Petitioners to obtain the conſolation of all humane miſeryes, the Councell doth ordaine that before it be granted unto the firſt Petitioner, he ſhall procure the permiſſion of the Lady whom he loves, to diſpoſe of his life, and upon a certificate of the ſame, his deſire ſhall be granted. As for the other; ſince his friend will not conſent unto his death he is declared incapable of obtaining the favour. And becauſe both of them are lovers and loved, and becauſe a lover ought not to live for himſelfe, but for the Perſon whom he loves, therefore by conſequence he neither can nor ought to diſpoſe of his life, without the permiſſion of her whoſe he is.</p>

               <p>Oh heavens? (cryed out <hi>Urſaces</hi> having heard this doome) how ſhall I paſſe away my ſad dayes and nights? Then making an humble reverence to the Lords, he went from the Councell, but ſo ſad that he could not obtaine his demand, as every one did admire the conſtancy and firme deſire of death. <hi>Olimbres</hi> was not ſo eager of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his deſire of death was onely to accompany his friend: and therefore was very glad of the denyal. Then they retyred to their lodgings, much lamenting their miſerable fortunes. And the noyſe was ſpread not onely all over the Towne but alſo through the Country, that two great Roman Perſons were come purpoſely to demand the poiſon. Upon this, a great Aſtrologer, who was deſirous to know who they were, came to viſit them. This man was very old, and had wholly addicted himſelfe unto that ſcience, ſo as he was growne very admirable in predictions. This man being adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of their deſigne, fearing that their corrages diſpoſing them ſo eager of death, and the poiſon being denyed them, that they would have recourſe unto the ſword, he deſired he might adviſe them according to the rules of his Art. With this intention he went unto them one morning when they were alone in their chamber. He deſired me to be his conducter becauſe we had ſome acquaintance, when I was a ſtudent there. I ſhall not make any relation of the particular diſcourſe which they had, for they were very long. But ſo it was that punctually knowing the time of their Nativities: having long contemplated upon their Phyſiognomies and hands, and having drawne ſome lines in paper which he parted, and then joyned together; he ſaid thus unto them. Sirs, live, and preſerve your ſelves for a better ſeaſon, which the heavens do promiſe unto you. As for you (ſaid he unto <hi>Urſaces)</hi> you ſhall recover her whom you have loſt, by the meanes of a man whom of all the world you love beſt: you ſhall enjoy full contentment and poſſeſſe her many yeares, in the ſame Towne where your love firſt begun. And you (ſaid he unto <hi>Olimbres)</hi> you ſhall marry her whom you love: you ſhall bring her back unto her Country with her Mother; you ſhall not dye till an Emperour of the Weſt be made. Theſe things which I tell you are infallible, and nothing can divert them.</p>
               <p>The reputation of this man, had ſuch an influence upon <hi>Urſaces</hi> that he reſolved to believe him, and follow his counſell; and conjured him by the great God whom he adored, to aſſiſt him with his beſt adviſe. Then he propounded unto him the hatred of <hi>Genſerick,</hi> and the danger he ſhould incurre by going into <hi>Affrica.</hi> You muſt, (ſaid he) ſend back all your domeſtiques into <hi>Italy,</hi> and make a ſhew as if you would kill your ſelfe, to the end the report of your death may be ſpread abroad: ſome few dayes after, you muſt deſigne your ſelfe in the habit of a ſlave and put your ſelfe into the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of your friend, who may carry you into <hi>Affrica</hi> where he ſhall meet <hi>Genſerick,</hi> and doubt not but that being thus unknowne, you will compaſſe your deſires. I would adviſe you to go unto <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> there ſtay till <hi>Olimbres</hi> come to you with <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe</hi> and <hi>Placidia:</hi> for I finde by my obſervations that he will bring them thither. But I have three reaſons to ſay that you muſt go into <hi>Affrica.</hi> Firſt becauſe I do foreſee that you muſt be taken for a ſlave, and you cannot avoyd it: Secondly, that perhaps your ſtay there will be very vexatious to you in being ſo long without your friend, and not ſeeing her you love and laſtly that you may aſſiſt <hi>Olimbres</hi> with your counſell, who will have occaſion to ſtand in need of it. Moreover, it is very neceſſary that you make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ill will that he may conceive againſt <hi>Olimbres;</hi> if you ſtay either in <hi>Greece</hi> or in <hi>Italy,</hi> it is impoſſible, but ſome or other will diſcover you. Thus did this wiſe man adviſe him, and after he had committed him to heavens cuſtody, he went home to his houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Urſaces</hi> having conſulted long with himſelfe what to do, at the laſt reſolved to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him punctually in every thing; and therefore one evening, having gotten a bladder full of blood cloſe to his ſide, under his clothes, he went to walk by the Sea-ſide, with moſt of his domeſticks following him, and many others of the Towne, where after he had made a long and ſad diſcourſe of his miſeries, and complained extreamly againſt his refuſall of poyſon, faigning that he would not live any longer, he thruſt a knife into his ſide, and made the blood in the bladder run out in great abundance, ſo as every one thought him dead. Then getting from amongſt them, he threw himſelfe into the Sea, leaving us his Cloak in our hands, <hi>Olimbres</hi> and I ſeeming, as if we endeavoured to hold him. It was now twilight, and he could ſwim very well, ſo as plunging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe over head, and ſwimming under water, we preſently loſt the ſight of him. Every one was ſtricken with wonder, <hi>Olimbres</hi> lamented extreamly, purpoſely to make it be believed, that his friend was dead: Then telling what his name was, the newes of his death was divulged far and neer. In the mean time, I went unto the place where I knew he would retire himſelfe, and bringing him the habit of a Slave, and lodging him in a poor houſe, I accommodated him with all things requiſite.</p>
               <p>It hapned the next morning, <hi>Olimbres</hi> ſeeming to ſearch for the body of his friend, found the Corps of the good old Chirurgion, and bringing it unto his two Daughters, they rendred him the laſt office of a Sepulcher, as if heaven would not let this happy old man want any dues that belonged unto men, after his death: His Daughters ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him a Tombe, and I, at their requeſt, did write his Epitaph, which was fixed upon it. A few daies after, <hi>Olimbres</hi> ſent all his Domeſticks, together with thoſe of <hi>Urſaces</hi>'s, and the two Daughters of the old Chirurgion, into <hi>Italy;</hi> and taking others, he went with his friend, diſguiſed like a Slave, into <hi>Affrica,</hi> much deſiring my company: But, ſince my deſtiny was, to obey him who brought me up, I would not diſobey his will.</p>
               <p>This, Madam, (ſaid <hi>Silvander</hi> unto <hi>Leonida)</hi> is all that I know concerning the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of <hi>Urſaces,</hi> who for his fidelity, deſerves all manner of contentment. <hi>Leonida</hi> would have anſwered, if <hi>Hylas</hi> had not ſtept in and interrupted her: Did you ever hear (ſaid he) of ſuch a fool, the veryeſt fool that ever made profeſſion of any love? What! ſerve all his life for no other contentment, but to be called, <hi>My Cavalier,</hi> and to call her, <hi>My faireſt Princeſſe,</hi> or at the beſt, to have but ſome few dry and miſerable kiſſes? And this, forſooth, muſt be thought enough, to make him run ſo many hazards of his life, to ſpil ſo much of his blood, to demand poyſon, and at laſt to turn ſlave. For my part, I think he is rightly ſerved, and let him take all his labour for his paines; let him wear the habit of a ſlave into <hi>Affrica,</hi> for all his life has been nothing but a ſlavery. <hi>Adamas</hi> and all the Company could not chuſe but laugh at the opinion of <hi>Hylas,</hi> and had it not been ſupper-time, I believe he had not paſſed without an anſwer. But the Druide roſe up, and taking <hi>Tircis</hi> by one hand, and <hi>Phocion</hi> by the other, he took a turne or two in the Gallery, whilſt ſupper was ſetting upon the table, and every one obſerved what he thought moſt rare; and amongſt the reſt, <hi>Tircis</hi> looking upon a King, armed with many Pennons and ornaments hanging about him, with a countenance full of gravity: Father, (ſaid he unto him) I beſeech you tell me, who is this, who bears upon his Shield of <hi>Gules,</hi> three <hi>Diademes, Or?</hi> It is <hi>Pharamond,</hi> ſaid the Druide; the firſt King of the <hi>Francks,</hi> who made the <hi>Romans</hi> feel the weight of his victorious Armes in <hi>Gaul.</hi> And who is that, continued <hi>Tircis,</hi> that is next unto him, that beareth <hi>Azure,</hi> a <hi>Cat, Argent,</hi> armed <hi>Gules?</hi> It is (ſaid <hi>Adamas) Gondioch,</hi> King of the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> who took this Animall for his Armes. And, who the other, (ſaid <hi>Tircis)</hi> who bears <hi>Or,</hi> three <hi>Ravens,,</hi> with their wings diſplayed, Proper, and purple Tallons? It is (anſwered <hi>Adamas)</hi> the King of the <hi>Gepides,</hi> called <hi>Ardarick.</hi> Who is he, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Tircis,</hi> who bears <hi>Gules,</hi> a <hi>Falcon,</hi> with wings diſplayed, <hi>Or,</hi> crowned <hi>Argent?</hi> I need not ask you, for you have already told me, that he is called <hi>Attilas,</hi> King of the <hi>Hunnes.</hi> It muſt needs be confeſſed, that you have been very curious, not only in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Pictures of ſo many illuſtrious perſons, but alſo in adorning them, and arming them as they were wont to be.</p>

In the mean time, <hi>Hylas,</hi> who held <hi>Alexis</hi> by her hand, he was diſcourſing upon other ſubjects; for, being growne deſperately in love with her, he could not upon any termes leave her. <hi>Adamas,</hi> who took notice of it, and was very glad that he was ſo miſtaken, becauſe it would more delude others. When he was going out of the Gallery, he turned towards <hi>Hylas:</hi> Well, ſhepheard, (ſaid he unto him) which is the Piece whom you think faireſt in the place? <hi>Hylas</hi> made preſent anſwer, that it was <hi>Alexis.</hi> But, ſaid <hi>Adamas,</hi> I mean, of the Pictures which you have ſeen. Have ſeen! ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> nay, I have no eyes to look upon any thing but <hi>Alexis:</hi> And if you look for any ſatisfaction to that queſtion, you muſt aske <hi>Tircis;</hi> for thoſe are Pictures only of dead perſons, and he loves ſuch above any that are alive. I am able to anſwer for my ſelfe, ſaid <hi>Tircis,</hi> that I do ſee none fairer then <hi>Alexis,</hi> nor which pleaſeth me better. How (ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> who began to be jealous) <hi>Hylas,</hi> I ſee then, is not the only inconſtant man in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, ſince you are growne a liker of any. But Miſtreſſe, (ſaid he unto <hi>Alexis)</hi> let it not trouble you, for he is better for being inconſtant. Why, Servant, (ſaid <hi>Alexis)</hi> do you ſay ſo? Becauſe, ſaid he, that he was wont to love none but dead people. Do you not ſee, replyed <hi>Tircis,</hi> that if I love death, I muſt needs love <hi>Alexis,</hi> ſince her beauty is able to kill as many as death it ſelfe? Ah! (replyed <hi>Hylas)</hi> if you take it in that ſenſe, I have done: But to make us both contented, let her give death unto <hi>Tircis,</hi> and life unto <hi>Hylas.</hi> Both you and I ſhall be very well contented, replyed <hi>Tircis,</hi> in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving either a life or a death ſo ſweet. Upon this word, every one going out of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, they ſat down to ſupper, which being ended, and a good part of the night ſpent in diſcourſe, they were all conducted to their Chambers, where having reſted themſelves, they went the next morning to their own Homes, ſo ſatisfied with the courteous ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility of <hi>Adamas,</hi> and with the beauty and good behaviour of <hi>Alexis,</hi> that every one did highly commend them; but eſpecially <hi>Hylas,</hi> who not being able to hold from extolling the perfections of his new Miſtreſſe, by fortune they met with <hi>Aſtrea, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> in the great Meadow, with <hi>Madonthe, Laonice, Pallinice, Cyrcinea,</hi> and <hi>Florice,</hi> which expected their return, to hear a report of the beauty of <hi>Alexis,</hi> which they had already heard of. And <hi>Phillis</hi> addreſſing her ſelfe unto <hi>Lycidas:</hi> Well, ſhepheard, ſaid ſhe unto him, how do you like this ſo much cryed up Beauty? I will not anſwer you, ſaid he, untill you have asked <hi>Hylas.</hi> Well, Servant, ſaid ſhe unto <hi>Hylas,</hi> what reports will you afford us? And becauſe he anſwered not: What, Servant, ſaid ſhe not ſpeak unto your Miſtreſſe? You my Miſtreſſe, ſaid he, and I your Servant! No, no, if you think it, believe me, you are miſtaken; for I aſſure you, I think of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe. How! Servant, (ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> and ſeemed to be troubled) will you not have me to be your Miſtreſſe? Good ſhepheardeſſe, ſaid he, do not uſe the word, Servant, and the word, Miſtreſſe, ſo familiarly, for they are not ſeaſonable amongſt us. At what Game (ſaid ſhe) have I loſt you, <hi>Hylas?</hi> At the Game of the <hi>Faireſt,</hi> anſwered he. Do you not know, that it was alwaies my cuſtome, to leave thoſe I loved, as ſoon as I found one that was fairer: Aske <hi>Florice, Cyrcenea, Palliuice, Madonthe,</hi> and <hi>Laonice,</hi> if I did not ſo by them: If none of theſe will tell you, then ask <hi>Phillis,</hi> your very good friend; for if ſhe will confeſſe the truth, ſhe will tell you, how I have left her for <hi>Alexis,</hi> who indeed is the faireſt and moſt lovely, that ever I ſaw. Every one did laugh heartily at the diſcourſe of <hi>Hylas,</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> amongſt the reſt, who ſaid thus unto him: Why, ſhepheard, are you then fully reſolved to love me no longer? It is poſſible, you ſhould quit me for a Druide? But my comfort is, it will be long, before you can have any fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of your love; for <hi>Alexis</hi> cannot marry, untill her time with the <hi>Carnutans</hi> be expired. <hi>Hylas</hi> ſmiling and ſhaking his head at this: I aſſure you, ſhepheardeſſe, ſaid he, you tell me a thing, that would make me in love with <hi>Alexis,</hi> if I were not ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for ever ſince I began to look upon women, I never loved any yet ſo, but I began to hate her, as ſoon as ever I thought of marriage: So as if <hi>Alexis</hi> be not content with her time, I will give her as much more, and yet love her. Now let me tell you, there is an odd kinde of ambition in my love, which I muſt by all means ſtrive to ſatisfie. I have already loved Maides, Wives, and Widowes: I have courted my Inferiours, my Equalls, and my Superiours: I have ſerved fooles, crafty ones, and good ones: I have met with ſeverity, courteſy, and inſenſibility, to either love or hatred: I have tried old ones, middle aged, and very children: I have liked the fair, the black, and the browne, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: I have made addreſſes unto ſome, that did love me; unto others, that did not love me: I have tryed all conditions, and all humours, that can be in women. But I muſt

confeſſe, I never courted a Druide or a Veſtall before, I have been hitherto a Noviſt in that holy Tribe; and I think, the gods have ſent me this fair <hi>Alexis,</hi> to the end, I may make it my boaſt, that I am the moſt perfect and experienced Lover that ever was None in the Company could forbear laughing. <hi>Florice,</hi> ſhe addreſſed her ſelfe unto him: <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid ſhe, are you not afeard, that <hi>Tharamis</hi> will blaſt you with lightning from heaven, for offering to court one that is dedicated unto him? Oh! <hi>Florice,</hi> ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> you that are ſo religiouſly devoted unto the gods, have not you dedicated your ſelfe unto <hi>Tharamis,</hi> and yet you have had <hi>Theombres</hi> in your armes a thouſand times, and never feared any blaſting with lightning from heaven? 'Tis true, (ſaid <hi>Florice,</hi> very faintly) but things that are abſolutely forbidden, do more offend the gods, then thoſe which are indifferent. A very fine excuſe indeed, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> and well found out; pray tell me, where do you finde, that the gods did ever forbid it? If you had ever ſeen a Druide or a Veſtall received into their Orders, by their Antients, ſaid ſhe, you would not have asked me this queſtion. Oh, Oh, ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> I do now underſtand you very well; it is the old drie Druides that does forbid them, but yet they are no gods: It is a Law made only by men, men that are old, and not able to enjoy the pleaſures of youth, and therefore are envious, and deny unto youth what their age is deprived of. Fie, ſhepheard, (ſaid <hi>Tircis)</hi> mingle not things prophane with things ſacred, and conſider, that the gold of <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Temple, which coſt us <hi>Gaulians</hi> ſo dear, was dedicated unto him by men. Oh my good friend <hi>Tircis,</hi> ſaid <hi>Hylas,</hi> how long is it ſince you became ſo amorous? You, I ſay, who were not wont to be contented with the Living, but would rake the Tombes and Monuments for one, whom it pleaſed the gods to take unto themſelves from amongſt men; you, that were not wont to be converſant amongſt the living, but the dead, do you now come to talk of the gods, and of things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to living men? Oh, <hi>Hylas,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Tircis,</hi> and ſighed) how infinitely you wrong me; I do confeſſe, that I do love <hi>Cleon,</hi> and I ſhall rather loſe the memory of my ſelfe, then of her and her perfections. But wherein do I offend the gods, or in my duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men? Would it not be infinite ingratitude to the gods, not to honour their moſt perfect work? And he were not a man, that would not love or forget that thing, which above any in the world is moſt worthy of love and memory.</p>
               <p>Thus theſe Shepheards diſcourſed, whilſt <hi>Lycidas</hi> related unto <hi>Phillis</hi> and the fair <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> what he had ſeen in the houſe of <hi>Adamas,</hi> and how fair <hi>Alexis</hi> was. Truly, ſaid he, I hope, that I may without offence tell you, that ſhe is the very perfect reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of my dear and dead Brother, when he was in his greateſt beauty; for, I did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in all my life ſee two faces, no, nor any Glaſſe, repreſent a more exact reſemblance. Is it poſſible, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> So true, ſaid <hi>Lycidas,</hi> that I know no difference between them, but in their habit; and to tell you truly, me thought <hi>Alexis</hi> to be a little fairer of the two. Oh heavens! ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> can you favour me ſo far, as to help my eyes unto this long'd for ſight? Then turning to <hi>Diana,</hi> and whiſpering her in the ear: I promiſe you, Siſter, ſaid ſhe, that if I can obtain the favour, I will go with her, and turn Druide. Oh god, Siſter, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> never think of ſuch a ſad ſeparation, or elſe reſolve, to take <hi>Phillis</hi> and me with you. Oh, ſaid <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that is too unreaſonable, for it would be too great a wrong unto <hi>Silvander</hi> and <hi>Lycidas. Diana</hi> would have replyed, but <hi>Aſtrea</hi> made a ſigne unto her to be ſilent, leſt they ſhould be heard. After this, all the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny retired to their own homes, reſolving to viſit <hi>Adamas</hi> and the fair <hi>Alexis</hi> within three daies after: A terme, which <hi>Aſtrea</hi> thought to be an age, ſo extreamly did ſhe long for a ſight of this ſo much beloved reſemblance. In the mean while, <hi>Celadon</hi> was as impatient for a ſight of her.</p>
