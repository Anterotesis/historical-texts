            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>LAment and Wonder, Reader, here lies one</l>
            <l>Intomb'd, who did refuſe t'aſcend a Throne;</l>
            <l>Who Dyed, by the common ſtroke of Fate,</l>
            <l>As other Men, but liv'd not at that Rate;</l>
            <l>By Nature Great, yet Greater by Succeſſe,</l>
            <l>But above all, was in himſelf Greatest.</l>
            <l>He was a Souldier ſecond unto none</l>
            <l>In Courage, and a General well known</l>
            <l>In Prudence; and 'tis equally as true,</l>
            <l>He was a Loyal, Faithful Subject too;</l>
            <l>The Tyrant whom, both Kings and Nations fear'd,</l>
            <l>He only fear'd him not, but boldly Dar'd.</l>
            <l>The Tyrant being dead, this Gen'ral came,</l>
            <l>And ſaw th'ſucceeding Rage, then Overcame;</l>
            <l>Not by the Noiſe of Arms, but by the Deep</l>
            <l>Silence of Counſels, which he knew to keep;</l>
            <l>Strange kind of Conq'ring this, and almoſt New,</l>
            <l>In one Dayes ſpace three Kingdoms to ſubdue,</l>
            <l>(Without engaging of his Tongue, or Sword)</l>
            <l>And yet of Either would not be the Lord;</l>
            <l>Accompting it more Grandeur for to ſave</l>
            <l>Three Scepters, and Reſtore them, than to have:</l>
            <l>For being made an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mpire, did decree</l>
            <l>'Twas better to Reſtore, a King, than be:</l>
            <l>And thus reſolv'd, the King he did Reſtore,</l>
            <l>Then Him, as <hi>Caeſar,</hi> Humbly did Adore.</l>
            <l>It was King <hi>CHARLES,</hi> for whoſe moſt worthy Sake</l>
            <l>(And not his own) he did this Conqueſt make;</l>
            <l>That all may know by reading of his Story,</l>
            <l>Humility was his Aim, not Glory;</l>
            <l>Since with more Modeſty unto the King</l>
            <l>He did ſubmit, than thoſe who injur'd him:</l>
            <l>Moſt happy man, who didſt three Kingdoms gain,</l>
            <l>That <hi>CHARLES</hi> th' Second might ſolely in them Reign.</l>
            <l>A Prince, whoſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irtues are ſo Great, that He,</l>
            <l>Deſerves more Kingdoms Crowns, as well as three:</l>
            <l>Forgetting nothing but paſt Injuries;</l>
            <l>Mindful of nothing, but good Offices.</l>
            <l>Even Him he did reſtore unto his Throne;</l>
            <l>With Him, PEACE, J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>STICE, and RELIGION.</l>

            <l>For which, his Cares and Life he valued not</l>

            <l>All good Men were his Friends, his Foes were they,</l>

            <l>Titles, Honours, Wealth, he did inherit,</l>
            <l>(High as they were) yet much beneath his Merit:</l>
            <l>Though Fortune did advance him above others, he</l>
            <l>Had in himſelf the more Humility.</l>
            <l>At length, this brave Heroick Gen'ral Dy'd,</l>
            <l>About the time his Son had ta'ne a Bride;</l>
            <l>That ſo the Joyes in her might ſeem to dry</l>

            <l>Of Grief, if maſter'd by Calamity;</l>
            <l>Which is ſo great, that nothing can repair,</l>
            <l>Although he left a Son, his worthieſt Heir:</l>
            <l>For <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irtue hath no Parent, from whoſe Race,</l>
            <l>It may derive to Succeſſors its Grace.</l>
            <l>HEROES are ſuch by Birth, and ſuch they Dye</l>
            <l>Without Tranſmiſſion to Poſterity;</l>
            <l>And ſuch a one as this nor <hi>England</hi> ſaw,</l>
            <l>Nor ever ſhall the World to keep't in awe.</l>
