         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

which have of late portracted and hindered our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding,
the present grievances which possesse our
Army and are yet enremedied, with our desire as to
the compleat settlement of the liberties and peace of
the Kingdome, which is that blessing of God then
which nothing is more deare to us, or more precious
in our thoughts, we having hitherto thought all our
present injoyments, whether of life or livelihood, or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57840:4"/>
nearest relations, a price but sufficient to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
of so rich a blessing, that we, and all the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
people of this Nation may sit downe in quiet
under our Vines, and under the glorious admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
of Justice and Righteousnesse, and in full
possession of those fundamentall rights and liberties
without which we can have little hopes as to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
considerations, to enjoy either any comforts of
life, or so much as life it selfe, but at the pleasures
of men, ruling meerely according to will and
power. It cannot be unknowne what hath passed
betwixt the Parliament and the Army as to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of <hi>Ireland;</hi> by all which together with the
like proceedings against the Army, in relation to
their Petition and grievances, all men may judge
what hath hindered the Army from a ready ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in that service, and without further Account
or Apology as to that partieular, then what those
passages and proceedings themselves already made
publike doe afford; we doe appeale to your selves,
whether those courses to which the Parliament hath
by the designes and practice of some been drawne,
have rationally tended to induce a cheerefull and
unanimous undertaking of the Army to that service,
or rather breake and pull the Army in peeces with
discontents and dishonour, and to put such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obligations
and provocations upon it as might drive
it into distemper, and indeed discourage both this
Army and other Souldiers from any further engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Parliaments service: And we wish all
men would with us upon the whole carriage seriously
consider, whether in the intentions of those who
have by false informations, and mis-representations
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57840:4"/>
put the Parliament upon such wayes: The timely and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
reliefe of <hi>Ireland</hi> seeme really to have been inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
or rather (with the breaking or disbanding of this
Army) to draw together or raise such other Forces, and
of such a temper as might serve to some desperate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
designes in <hi>England,</hi> which (besides the probable
suspitions from their carriage of the businesse, we have
before hand, in the transaction thereof, had more then
hints of such a designe, by cleare expressions to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
from many of those Offiers of the Army, that
have been perswaded, and appeared most forward to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
for <hi>Ireland</hi> on the termes proposed. And that such
a designe hath all along been driven, seemes now too
evident by the present disposing of those Forces that
have been ingaged for <hi>Ireland</hi> by the indeavour of some
to gaine a power from the Parliament, of ordering those
Forces for some Service in <hi>England,</hi> and by the private
listings of men for service here, without any publique
Authority of Parliament; And (all this) by the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who have all along appeared most active and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in the late proceedings against the Army.</p>
            <p>As to the just discontents and dis-satisfaction of the
Army, in relation to their grievances, and their non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complyance
to the late Orders for Souldiers disbanding
by peece-meale, before more full and equall satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were given to the whole; We desire you to looke
back to the Papers already published of the grievances
themselves, the Narrative of the Officers, and to the
latter Papers from the Generall Councell of Warre at
<hi>Bury,</hi> and the late generall Rendezvouze neare <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market;</hi>
and (we thinke your late resuming the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of those things (as to a further satisfaction) doth
much justifie the defires and proceedings of the Army in
those past particulars hitherto. And though (had we
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57840:5"/>
(upon our first addresses) for our undoubled Rights and
dues) found a free and candid reception, with a just con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
and a reasonable satisfaction, or at least an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Answer therein; We should have been easily
satisfiable to have abated or forborne much of our dues,
and not to have inquired into, or considered (so farre
as we have) either the possibilities there are for more
present satisfaction of Arreares, or the credit of future
securities proposed; yet since upon those former addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
we have found such hard dealing (as in the said Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
is set forth, and those additionall (though hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
but partiall satisfaction) coming so hardly as they have,
we finde no obliging reasons in the least, to decline or
recede from what is our due, but rather still to adhere
unto our desires of full and equall satisfaction in all the
things mentioned in the aforesaid Papers, not onely
in behalfe of our selves and the Army, but also of the
whole Souldiery thorow out the Kingdome, who have
concurred, or shall concurre with us in the same desires,
and to all our former desires. As Souldiers we cannot
but adde this, wherein we finde our selves so neerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in point of Justice and Reputation, that more
care, and a stricter course may be taken for good, all
Articies granted upon surrendors, according to the ture
intent and meaning of them; as also for remedy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
in case of any breach (and this) without those
delayes which divers have found as prejudiciall to them,
or more then if they had been totally denied the
performance of them. Nor will it now (we hope) seeme
strange or unseasonable to rationall and honest men, who
consider the consequence of our present case, and their own
and the Kingdoms, as well as our future concernments in
point of right, freedome, peace and safety, if from a deepe
sence of the high consequence of our present case, both to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57840:5"/>
our selves (in future) and all other people, we shall before
Disbanding proceed in our owne and the Kingdoms behalfe
to propound, and plead for some provision for our and the
Kingdoms satisfaction, and future security in relation to
those things, especially considering that we were not a meere
mercinary Army, hired to serve any Arbitrary power of
Estate, but called forth and conjured by the severall Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of Parliament, for the defence of our owne and the
peoples Rights and Liberties, and so we tooke up Armes in
Judgement and conscience to those ends, and have so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
them, and are resolved according to your first just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires
in your Declarations, and such principles as we have
received from your frequent informations, and our owne
common sence concerning those our fundamentall Rights
and Liberties, to effect and vindicate the just power and right
of this Kingdome in Parliaments for those common ends
promised against all Arbitrary power, violence and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and all particular parties or interests whatsoever, the
said Declarations still directing us to the equitable sence of
all Lawes and Constitutions, as dispensing with the very
letters of the same, and being supreame to it, when the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and preservation of all is concerned, and assuring us that
all authority is fundamentally sealed in the Office, and but
ministerially in the Persons; neither doe, or will these our
proceedings (as we are fully and in conscience perswaded)
amount to any thing not warrantable before God and men,
being thus farre much short of the common proceedings
in other Nations, to things of an higher nature then we
have yet appeared to: and we cannot but be sensible of the
great complplaints that have been made to us generally in
the Kingdome, from the people where we march, by Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and otherwise of Arbitrarinesse and injustice to
their great and insupportable oppressions.</p>
            <p>And truly such Kingdomes as have according both to
the Law of Nature and Nations, appeared to the vindication
and defence of their just Rights and Liberties have procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
much higher, as our Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who in the
first beginning of these late differences, associated in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
from the very same Grounds and Principles, having no
visible sorme either of Parliament or King to countenance
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57840:6"/>
them, &amp; as they were therein inftituted &amp; protected by their
own and this Kingdome also, so we justly shall expect to be.</p>
            <p>We need not mention the State of the <hi>Nether-Lands,</hi> the
<hi>Portugalls,</hi> and others, all proceeding upon the same Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Right and Freedome, and accordingly the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath Declared it no resisting of Majestracy to side
with the just Principles, and Law of Nature and Nations,
being that Law upon which we have assisted you, and that
the Souldiery may lawsully hold the hands of that Generall
who will turne his Cannon against his Army on purpose to
destroy them: the Seamen, the hands of that Pilot who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
runs the Ship upon the rock (as our Brethren of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
argued) and such were the proceedings of our Ancestors
of famous memory, to the purchasing of such Rights and
Liberties as they have enjoyed through the price of their
blood, and we both by that and the latter blood of our dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
friends and fellow Souldiers, all the hazard of our owne
doe lay claime unto.</p>
            <p>Nor is that supreme end (the glory of God) wanting in these cases to set a
price upon all such proceedings of righteousnesse and justice, it being one
witnesse of God in the world to carry on a testimony against the injustine and
unrighteousnesse of men, and against the miscartiages of Governments, when
corrupted or declining from their primitive and originall glory.</p>
            <p>These things we mention but to compare proceedings, and to shew that
we are so much the more justifiable and warrantable in what we do; by
how much we come short of that height and measure of proceedings, which
the people in free Kingdomes and Nations have formerly practised.</p>
            <p>Now having thus farre cleared our way in this businesse, we shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
to propound such things as we do humbly desire for the serling and
securing of our owne and the Kingdomes peace and safety, as followeth:</p>
            <p>1. That the Houses may be speedily purged of such Members, as for
their Delinquency, or for corruptions or abuse to the State, or undue electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ought not to sit there; whereof the late election in Cornwall, Wales,
and other parts of the Kingdome afford too many examples, to the great
prejudice of the peoples freedome, in the said Elections.</p>
            <p>2. That those persons who have in the late unjust and high proceedings
against the Army, appeared to have the will, the confidence, credit, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
to abuse the Parliament and the Army, and indanger the Kingdome in
the carrying on such things against us (while an Army) may be some way spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
disabled from doing the like or worse to us (who disbanded and dispearst,
and in the condition of private men) or to other the free borne people of
England, in the same condition with us: And that (for that purpose) the
same persons may not continue in the same power (especially) as our and the
Kingdoms Iudges in the Highest Trust, but may be made incapable thereof for
futute.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:57840:6"/>
And if it be questioned who these are, we thought not fit
particularly to name them in this our Representation to you, but
shall very speedily give in their names, and before long shall offer
what we have to say against them to your Commissioners:
wherein we hope so to carry our selves, as that the world shall see
we aim at nothing of private revenge or animosities, but that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
may have a free course, and the Kingdom be eased and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
by disinabling such men at least from places of Judicature,
who desiring to advantage or set up themselves and their party
in a general confusion, have endeavored to put the Kingdom into
a new flame of War, then which nothing is more abhorrent
to us.</p>
            <p>But because neither the granting of these alone would be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to secure our own and the Kingdoms Right, Liberties and
Safety, either for the present Age or posterity: Nor would our
proposal of this singly be free from the scandal and appearance of
Faction or Design onely to weaken one party (under the notion
of unjust or tyrannical) that we may advance another which may
be imagined more our own) We therefore Declare, That indeed
we cannot but wish that such men, and such onely might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the great power and trust of the Commonwealth, as
are approved at least for Moral Righteousness; and of such, we
cannot but in our wishes prefer those that appear acted thereunto
by a principle of Conscience and Religion in them: And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
we do and ever shall bless God for those many such Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies,
who through his providence have been chosen into this
Parliament, and to such mens endeavors under God) we cannot
but attribute that Vindication in part of the peoples Rights and
Liberties, and those beginnings of a just Reformation, which the
first proceedings of this Parliament appeared to have driven at
and tended to, though of late obstructed, or rather diverted to
other ends and interests, by the prevailing of other persons of
other principles and conditions.</p>
            <p>But yet we are so far from designing or complying to have an
absolute or Arbitrary power fixt or setled for continuance, in
any persons what soever, as that (if we might be sure to obtain it)
we cannot wish to have it so in the persons of any whom we
could most confide in, or who should appear most of our own
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57840:7"/>
Opinions or Principles, or whom we might have personal assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of, or interest in; but we do and shall much rather wish,
That the Authority of this Kingdom in Parliaments rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
(that is) freely, equally and successively chosen, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to its original intention, may ever stand and have its course.
And therefore we shall apply our desires chiefly to such things, as
(<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y having Parliaments setled in such a right constitution) may
give most hopes of Justice and Righteousness to flow down
eqully to all in that its ancient channel, without any Overtures
tending either to overthrow that foundation of Order and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in this Kingdom, or to ingross that power for perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity
into the hands of any particular persons or party whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
and for that purpose, though as we have found it doubted
by many men (minding sincerely the publique good, but not
weighing so fully all consequences of things) it may, and is not
unlike to prove, That upon the ending of this Parliament, and the
Election of new, the constitution of succeeding Parliaments (as
to the persons elected) may prove for the worse many ways; yet
since neither in the present purging of this Parliament, nor in the
Election of new, we cannot promise to our selves or to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
an assurance of Justice, or other positive good, from the
hands of men, but those who for present appear most righteous
and most for common good (having an unlimited power fixed in
them during life or pleasure) in time may become corrupt, or
settle into parties or Factions; or on the other side, in the case
of new Elections, those that should so succeed may prove as bad
or worse then the former: We therefore humbly conceive, That
(of two inconveniences the less being to be chosen) the main
things to be intended in this case (and beyond which humane
providence cannot reach, as to any assurance of positive good)
seems to be this; <hi>viz.</hi> To provide, that however unjust or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the persons of Parliament-men in present or future may
prove, or whatever ill they may do to particular parties, or to
the whole in particular things, during their respective terms or
periods, yet they shall not have the temptation or advantage of
an unlimited power fixt in them during their own pleasures,
whereby to perpetuate Injustice and Oppression upon any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
end or remedy, or to advance and uphold any one particular
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57840:7"/>
Party, Faction or Interest whatsoever, to the oppression or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of the Community, and the inslaving of the Kingdom unto
all posterity; but that these people may have an equal hope or
possibility (if they have made an ill choice at one time to amend
it in another) and themselves may be in a capacity to taste of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
aswel as Rule, and may so be inclined to consider of other
mens cases, as what may come to be their own. This we speak
as in relation to the House of Commons, as being intrusted on
the peoples behalf for their interest in that great and Supreme
power of the Commonwealth, <hi>(viz.</hi> The Legislative power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
with the power of final Judgement) which being in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
so Arbitrary, and in a maner unlimited (unless in point of
time) is most unfit and dangerous, as to the peoples interest, to
be sixt in the persons of the same men during life or their own
pleasure; neither by the original constitution of this State was it
or ought it to continue so, nor do's it where ever it is and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
so, render that State any better then a meer Tyranny, or
the people subjected to it any better then Vassals; but in all
States where there is any face of common Freedom, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in this State of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> as is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
both by many Positive Laws (and Ancient constant Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms)
the People have a Right to new and successive Elections
unto that great and Supreme Trast, at certain periods of time,
which is so Essential and Fundamental to their Freedom, as it
cannot or ought not to be denied them or withheld from their,
and without which the House of Commons is of very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
to the Interest of the Commons of <hi>England:</hi> Yet in
this we would not be misunderstood, in the least to blame those
Worthies of both Houses, whose zeal to vindicate the Liberties
of this Nation, did procure that Act for continuance of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
whereby it was secured from being dissolved at the
Kings pleasure, as former Parliaments have been, and reduced
to such a certainty as might enable them the better to assert
and vindicate the Liberties of this Nation, immediately before
so highly invaded, and then also so much indangered; and these
we take to be the principal ends and grounds for which in that
exigency of time and affairs it was promised, and to which we
acknowledge it hath happily been made use of: But we cannot
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57840:8"/>
think it was by those Worthies intended, or ought to be made
use of, to the perpetuating of that Supreme Trust and Power in
the persons of any during their own pleasures, or to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring
of the People from their right of Elections totally new,
when those Dangers or Exigencies were past, and the Affairs
and Safety of the Common-wealth would admit of such a
change.</p>
            <p>Having thus cleared our Grounds and Intentions, as we hope,
from all scruples or misunderstandings; in what follows we
shall proceed further to propose, what we humbly desire for the
setling and securing of our own and the Kingdoms Rights and
Liberties (through the blessing of God to Posterity) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
upon all the grounds premised, we further humbly desire
as followeth:</p>
            <p>3. That some determinate period of time may be set, for
the continuance of this and future Parliaments, beyond which
none shall continue, and upon which new Writs may of course
issue out, and new Elections successively take place, according to
the intent of the Bill for Triennial Parliaments.</p>
            <p>And herein we would not be misunderstood, to desire a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
or sudden dissolution of this Parliament, but onely (as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
before) That some certain period may be set for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
of it, so as it may not remain (as now) continuable
for ever, or during the pleasure of the present Members: And
we should desire, That the period to be now set for ending this
Parliament, may be such as may give sufficient time for provision
of what is wanting, and necessary to be passed in point of Just
Reformation, and for further securing the Rights, Liberties, and
setling the Peace of the Kingdom; In order to which we further
humbly offer:</p>
            <p>4. That secure provision may be made for the continuance of
future Parliaments, so as they may not be adjournable or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvable
at the Kings pleasure, or any other ways, then by their
own consent, during their respective periods, but at those periods
each Parliament to determine of course, as before: This we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
may be now provided for (if it may be) so as to put it out
of all dispute for future, though we think of right it ought not
to have been otherwise before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:57840:8"/>
And thus a firm foundation being said in the Authority and
Constitution of Parliament, for the hopes at least of Common
and Equal Right and Freedom to our selves, and all the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
People of this Land; We shall for our parts freely and
cheerfully commit our stock or share of Interest in this Kingdom
into this common Botton of Parliaments; and though it may
(for our particulars) go ill with us in one voyage, yet we shall
thus hope (if right be with us) to fare better in another: These
things we desire may be provided for by Bill or Ordinance of
Parliament, to which the Royal Assent may be desired; and when
His Majesty in these things, and what else shall be proposed by
the Parliament, necessary for securing the Rights and Liberties of
the People, and for setling the Militia and Peace of the Kingdom,
shall have given his Concurrence, to put them past all dispute;
We shall then desire, That the Rights of His Majesty and His
Posterity may be considered of, and setled in all things, so far as
may consist with the Right and Freedom of the Subject, and
with the security of the same for future.</p>
            <p>5. We desire, That the Rights and Freedom of the People to
represent, by way of humble Petition to the Parliament, their
Grievances in such things as cannot otherwise be remedied, then
by Parliament, may be cleared and vindicated: That all such
Grievances of the People may be freely received and admitted
into consideration, and put into an equitable and speedy way to
be heard, examined and redressed (if they appear real) And that
in such things for which men have remedy by Law, they may
be freely left to the benefit of Law, and the regulated course of
Justice, without interruption or check from the Parliament, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in case of things done upon the Exigency of War, or for
the service and benefit of the Parliament and Kingdom, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the War, or otherwise, in due pursuance and execution
of Ordinances or Orders of Parliament.</p>
            <p>More particularly under this Head we cannot but desire, That
all such as are imprisoned for any pretended Misdemenor, may
be put into a speedy way for a just Hearing and Tryal, and such
as shall appear to have been unjustly and unduly imprisoned, may
(with their liberties) have some reasonable reparation, according
to their sufferings, and the demerit of their oppressors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:57840:9"/>
6. That the large Powers given to Committees or Deputy
Lieutenants, during the late times of War and Distraction, may
be speedily taken into consideration, That such of those Powers
as appear not necessary to be continued, may be taken away, and
such of them as are necessary, be put into a regulated way, and
left to as little Arbitraryness as the nature and necessity of the
things wherein they are conversant will bear.</p>
            <p>7. We could wish that the Kingdom might both be righted,
and publikely satisfied in point of Accompts for the vast sums
that have been levied and paid, as also in divers other things
wherein the Commonwealth may be conceived to have been
wronged or abused; But we are loath to press any thing that
may tend to lengthen out further disputes or contestations, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such as may tend to a speedy and general composure and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting
of mens mindes in order to Peace: For which purpose we
further propose,</p>
            <p>8. That (pablique Justice being first satisfied by some few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
to Posterity, out of the worst of excepted persons and
other Delinquents having past their compositions) some course
may be taken (by an Act of Oclivion or otherwise) whereby
the seeds of future War or Fewds, either to the present age or
posterity may the better be taken away, by easing that sence of
present, and satisfying those fears of future ruine or undoing
to persons or families, which may drive men into any desperate
ways <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or self-preservation or remedy; and by taking away the
private remembrances and distinctions of parties, as far as may
stand with safety to the Rights and Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erties we have hitherto
fought for.</p>
            <p>There are besides these, many particular things which we could
wish to be done, and some to be undone, all in order still to the
same ends of Common Right, Freedom, Peace and Safety: but
these proposals aforegoing present, being the principal things
we bottom and in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>st upon, we shall (as we have said before, for
out puts) acquiesce for other particulars to the Wisdom and
Justice of Parliament.</p>
            <p>And whereas it hath been suggested or suspected, That in our
late or present proceedings, our design is to overthrow Presbytery,
or hinder the setlement thereof, and to have the Independent
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57840:9"/>
Government set up, we do clearly disclaim and disavow any
such de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gn: we only desire, That according to the Declaration
(promising a provision for tender Consciences) there may some
effectual course be taken according to the intent thereof, and that
such, who upon conscientious grounds may differ from the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
Forms, may not for that be debarred from the common
Rights, Liberties or Benefits belonging equally to all, as men and
members of the Commonwealth, while they live soberly, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly,
and inoffensively towards others, and peaceably and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
towards the State.</p>
            <p>Wee have thus freely and clearly decalred the depth and
bottoms of our hearts &amp; desires, in order to the Rights, Liberties,
and Peace of the Kingdom; wherein we appeal to all men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we seek any thing of advantage to our selves, or any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
party what ever, to the prejudice of the whole; and whether
the things we wish and seek, do not equally concern and conduce
to the good of all in common, with our selves: According to
the sincerity of our desires and intentions, wherein (as we have
already found the concurrent sence of the people in divers Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
by their Petitions to the General, expressing their deep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment
of these things, and pressing us to stand for the interest
of the Kingdom therein, so) we shall wish and expect to finde
the unanimous concurrence of all others, who are equally concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with us in these things, and wish well to the Publique.</p>
            <p>And so (trusting in the mercy and goodness of God, to pass
by and help any failings or infirmities of ours, in the carriage or
proceedings hereupon) we shall humbly cast our selves and the
business upon his good pleasure, depending only on his presence
and blessing for an happy issue, to the Peace and good of this poor
Kingdom: In the accomplishment whereof, we desire and hope,
That God will make you blessed instruments.</p>
            <p>By the appointment of his Excellency. Sir <hi>Tho: Fairfax,</hi> and
Soldiers of the Army under his Command.</p>
