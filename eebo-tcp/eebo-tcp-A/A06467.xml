            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This loue of god, that causethe suche perfections in man, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Charitie. But remembre, it maye not be taken in the weake


<pb facs="tcp:5788:5"/>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon maner: for all they haue not this charite, that sey they loue God: nor all they loue not God, that so sey. We be not as our sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge soundeth, but as god seeth our thoughtes, so we be. None of vs loueth god, that enforceth to wylle any thynge besydes goddis will. He loueth not god perfetly, that thynketh any thynge besyde god: he loueth not god perfitely, that doth any thing without god. The perfecte loue of god can not stande with any care or studye for this lyfe: the perfyte loue of god abydeth not the couplynge with any other loue: the perfect loue of god knoweth none affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to kin red, it knoweth no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene pore and riche, it knoweth not what meneth myn and thyne, it canne not diuyde a foo from a


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:5788:5"/>
frende. For he that truly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly loueth god, muste loue god alone, nothynge besyde god, nor with god: but loue al indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in god and for god.</p>
            <p>We that say we loue god, when we scant ones in a day remembre god, and yet neuer remembre we God in suche a maner, but that more often and more ernestly we remembre other thynges, in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge we loue god, &amp; doinge thus, we can not ꝓue true that we sey. For the perfect louer of god is so wedded to god, that i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his thought nothynge abideth, but the quicke remembrance of god. Our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and sensis be occupied with so many other matters, that scante we haue leyser to think on god, so farre we be from this charite: the whiche I seye, is a vertue of that


<pb facs="tcp:5788:6"/>
dignitie, power, and maiestie, that by it selfe, it conteyneth al the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes of the patriarches, all the lawes of the prophetes, al the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christe, all the rules of the apostles, all the inuentions of the holy churche: ye more then all this, charite hath a libertie of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ouer bothe the olde and the newe testament. For the true lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of god, the whiche is the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable person, is vnder no reule: but he is a lorde aboue all lawes, all inuentions, all preceptis, all commandementis, that god hath gyuen to man. For charitie hathe no bonde.</p>
            <p>But alwey sister remembre, that charite is not perfect, oneles that it be burninge. It is not a quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched loue, a colde loue, a loue gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winge in the tethe or lyppes, that


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:5788:6"/>
is charite: but the hotte feruente burnynge hartes affect towarde god, is the loue that is vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the name of charitie, the which (as is sayd) doth not only conteyn all the doctrine of Christe, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so it is aboue all lawes, to rule ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to be ruled.</p>
            <p>The ende of all the course and walkynge of the sonne of god in this worlde, was to leue amonge men this charitie. The marke, wherto our sauiour in all his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge and teachynge loked, was to haue men indued with charite. For our diuine mayster sawe, that there neded no rehersal of sinnes, the whiche were to be eschewed, nor yet of vertues, that were to be folowed, if man could take cha ritie, that is by it selfe sufficiente for all, bothe to kepe menne from


<pb facs="tcp:5788:7"/>
stumbling in the wey, from wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derynge out of the wey, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to conducte men to the blessed wayes ende. Here you se, that the compasse and circuite of charite is large and wyde, in as moche as it comprehendeth al that can be spo ken, either agaynste vice, or with vertue.</p>
            <p>You peraduenture thought, that charite was nothynge els, but to kepe pacience, and not to be disple sed nor angry. It is trouthe, this poynt is one part of charitie: but it is not all. For what so euer the loue of god prouokethe vs to, or the feare of god dryueth vs from, all in one summe is concluded to be vnderstonde in charite.</p>
            <p>Whervpon I maye, if you kepe charitie say, that you be the very doughter of god, and moste dere


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:5788:7"/>
syster of Christe. But I feare me, you haue more ofte spoken the worde charitie, then you haue stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed to lerne, what thynge shulde be Charitie: and therby ye saye peraduenture of your selfe more then you doo. For I haue noted your mynde to be somwhat trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with certayne fantasies, the which could haue no place in you if you were fylled with this chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. For here a lyttell more in fewe wordes, what is the playne defini tion of this vertue, as I fynde it written of a greatte holy man, &amp; a commen doctour.</p>
            <p>Charitie (saythe he) is a good and a gracious affect of the soule, wherby mans harte hath no fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasye to esteme, valour, or pondre any thynge in this wyde worlde, beside or before the care and study


<pb facs="tcp:5788:8"/>
to knowe god. For who so euer is inclyned to loue these erthly thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, it is not possible for him euer to atteyne (so longe as he so doth) to the assurid constant &amp; perfit vse of this charite: bicause his mynd hath so manye and so diuerse let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, that hyndre and withdrawe hym from takynge the possession of this great treasure, wherin be couched the heapes of al vertues. And a lytel nowe to speke of these impedimentes and lettes, it shall moche apperteyn to our purpose: for we shall the quycklyer come to charitie, if we can knowe and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape all the blockes, that lye in our waye to lette vs: not onely to lette vs to come to charite, but to dryue and chase awaye frome vs this vertue, that neither we canne come to it, nor that to vs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:5788:8"/>The perfyte loue of god hath in<note place="margin">The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite loue of god.</note> it a meruaylous quietnes &amp; reste, it is neuer moued, styred, nor ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by no storme of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubles: but sytteth faste and sure in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual calmnes, ayenst al wedders, al blastes, al stormes.

            <p>You shall vnderstand, that there be certain motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s called passions, that soore assaulte our soule, and bringeth our spirite to moche vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnes:

            <p>The mother of al these passions is a parciall loue, that we beare to our selfe, that is to sey the loue of this carcas, and of this lyfe.

to gette this reste, that therby we may gette charitie, we muste caste aweye the loue of this lyfe: the whiche causeth all the sayde ruffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge passions, by the whiche our soule standeth in peryll of dethe.

Christe, the autor and preacher of<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> charitie: He aduysethe, counsay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and commaundeth me, if I be his disciple, not to resist ayenst euil, to offre my left cheke to him, that hathe be blowed me on the right, to leaue my gowne to hym that hath taken from me my cote, to walke two miles with him that hath vexed me, and compelled me to walke one myle.</p>
            <p>The forme of this lesson, that Christe here gyueth, is to enstruct and warne all christen men, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde nothynge of the bodye or of the worlde, aboue the reste &amp; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes of the mynde: but that we shulde suffre the losse of our goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, with the hurte, ye with the dethe of our bodyes, rather then we shulde lose any smalle porcion of charitie, to be moued with any

passion of mynde, wherby oure loue towarde god, myght decaye.</p>
            <p>It is not possible, after Christes doctrine, to take in this worlde by any kynde of violence so great damage or hurte in bodye or goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, as is the leest droppe of trou ble in the mynde, where no tyrant nor the deuyll hym selfe hath any dominion. For there onely ruleth our owne free wylle: so that if we wyll disordre our mynde with any passion, we be to our selfe more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent and cruell, than the deuylle can be. Wherfore my good sister, let vs beleue our maister Christe, and to the deathe, lette vs neuer breake peace with god. For if we do, fare well all rest. We breake peace with god, when we tourne vs for anye cause to the care of this lyfe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:5788:13"/>If you fele your selfe inordinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye moued with displeasant wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, with angry countenances, with euyll reportes, with dispray ses, with rebukes, with false sclan der, with vntrue compleyntes: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware syster, for surely you be not in charite with god.

And if you beleue the son of god, your selfe with your owne wylle, do more then any fierce prince o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer you coulde do, all thoughe he brought you to extreme wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and at the laste to the dethe tourmented your body.

But at this pointe peraduenture you wil say &amp; aske me: whether we shulde forsake all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities of this worlde: whether we shulde make no force to gette suche thinges, as kepeth vp the welthe of oure bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: whether we shulde vtterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse all thynges ordeyned for this lyfe: whether we shulde be cleane careles of good name?

Holy scripture forbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs nothynge, that is for vse or profytte: as by Christes lawe it is not forbed to eate, to drinke, to haue and gette, wherwith su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che sustinance maye be mayntey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to gette children, to haue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to haue possessiones, to be in honour, to be regarded: but the worde of god suffreth not glotto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,

And in the hauynge of the goodes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, and honours, we maye not iudge to be any higher at all, then is to haue thinges for mans necessitie: So that towarde them we may not beare any maner of loue or affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but only we must with suche a mynde take them to

This I say we may vse this worlde, but we may not abuse it, whan for the worlde we breake charitie with god. And if our hert be not holly geuen to loue god, we haue not god with perfyte chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:


<pb facs="tcp:5788:17"/>
god hath not our holle harte, yf the worlde haue any parte.</p>
            <p>This is the wey to come to perfit Charitie, to kepe our harte, oure soule, oure mynde, oure witte all holle for god: the whiche kepyng of our harte and mynde hole, is the reste and quietnes of the soule from the sayde temptations and passions. And this is the driuing awey of the lettes and unpedimen tes, to atteine charite, wherof now here a litle more.</p>
            <p>This perfecte loue of god ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth (as we haue sayd) the minde strong to withstond the thrusting and shulderyng of synne, and the same bringeth forthe consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ioyfull rest &amp; quietnes from the forsayde passions: whiche the corrupt loue of this lyfe bredeth. So that this calmenes of mynde


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:5788:17"/>
is a certayne effecte and worke of charitie. And hope in god maketh vs fyrmely to awayte for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fillynge of the promesse of god in vs, and to vs: which hope is gote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by pacience, that is a constant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durynge of aduersitie, the whiche paciente endurynge is purchased with abstinence, that is a stronge resistinge ageinst euill enticemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.

But ageyne let vs ones repete the effect of this lesson: who so euer beleueth our master, he fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his punysshment, and he that feareth to be punisshed of Christe, refreyneth hym selfe from sensual lustes, the whiche be the causes of punysshement: he that kepeth of suche causes: abydth wel and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freth tribulation: he that pacient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>The bearynge of Christes crosse is made by this Charitie a swete yocke and and an easye bourden.

he laboureth with pleasure, by reason of his fast loue toward god. He freely and gladly forgy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth all maner displeasures, of in iuries, of rebukes, of hurtes, &amp; so depe he is in loue, that nothig can cause him to hate. For it is a true sayenge, that who so euer felith in his harte any poynt of hatred, for any maner of cause, ageynste any maner a man, this person may be assured, that he is not in charitie with god. For our maystre Christ sayth: He that loueth me, kepeth<note place="margin">Io. 14. &amp;. 15.</note> my commaundmente: my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement is, that one of you loue another.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:5788:23"/>
man loueth euery man. Second I maye loue my neyghbour of a naturall affection, bycause he is my son, or brother, or kynsman. Thirdly I may loue for vayn glo rye, as if I loke by my neyghbour to be worshypped or auaunced to honour. Fourthly I may loue for couetousnes, as when I cheryshe and flatter a ryche manne for his goodes, when I make moche of them that haue done me pleasures &amp; may do me mo. The fifte waye, I maye loue for my sensuall luste, as when I loue to fare delicately, or els when I madde or dote vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon women.</p>
            <p>The fyrste waye to loue my neigh<note place="margin">Fyue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of loues.</note> bour, for the loue I haue to god, is onely worthy to be praysed.</p>
            <p>The second way naturally deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth neither prayse nor disprayse.


<pb facs="tcp:5788:24"/>
The thyrde, the fourthe, and the fyft to loue for glory, aduantage, or plesure, al thre be stark nought. Therfore syster, oute with youre loue, and considre well, in what way youre harte is gyuen to loue your neyghbour. Charitie hath but one waye of louynge a man truly and welle, that is onely for goddes sake.</p>
            <p>To conclude nowe this matter, the which of hym selfe is in sight, lette vs knytte vp Charitie with this generall knotte, that man is made absolute and perfecte in all vertues, through this one vertue of Charitie. But when I saye all vertues, loke that you vndersto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what is ment in the name of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: orelles this generalle clause may deceyue you. Wherfore you must lerne, that the body hath his


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:5788:24"/>
propre vertues, and the soule lyke wyse hath his owne a parte from the other. The vertues of the<note place="margin">Vertues of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye.</note> body be, as to faste, to watche, to goo on pylgremage, to traueylle with hande and fote, for to helpe their neyghboures, to distribute youre goodes in almes dedes, to buylde vp churches, wherin the people may here the word of god, and com to gether to prayer, to pu nysshe the fleshe with rough heer, to slepe vppon the harde grounde to socour the nedy, to ayde the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, and other such actes bodi lye men doo for the loue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of god. The vertues of the<note place="margin">Vertues of the soule.</note> soule be of an other sorte, as meke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, pacience, abstinence, hope, faithe, charitie, pitie, mercye, and other lyke. Nowe if it so be, that of some infirmite I can not faste,


<pb facs="tcp:5788:25"/>
nor watche, for lacke of money I can not do any almes, for lacke of bodily strength, I canne not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyle, yf suche necessary and true considerations make vs wante the vertues of the bodye, we be without blame, and had excused before god, the whiche beholdeth the secrete and priuie cause of our default. But in the vertues of the soule, we haue no maner of defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, if it be so that we lake anye of them. For they haue no necessitie, nor constraynt of any thynge, but all be frely vnder the election and choise of our free wyl. And whan it is generally sayde, that charite maketh a man absolute and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte in all vertues, ye muste vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstonde in all the vertues of the soule: the which be very vertues, to speke and to name the truthe.


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:5788:25"/>
Wherby the bodye canne haue of hym selfe no vertue, nor nothinge can be done of the body worthy of prayse, onles the acte be coupled and ioinid with the vertues of the mynde. But contrary, the soule is perfecte in his vertues without all assistence and helpe of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Then boldly we may say, that from charitie cometh all vertues, and none other werke there is of charitie, then to make and bringe forth in vs vertu. It is holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures testimony, that charite can not be ydle. Alwaye than a chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table spirite is doing, &amp; what so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he doethe, it muste nedes be a good werke. For what can com from the loue of god, but it shall sauer and smelle of god? the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che sauour is the onelye thynge, that geueth to mans acte all the

and that the. iiii. orders of freres beganne in christendome within a lyttell tyme paste: yet in eche of these forsaide sayinges, we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonde more then a hundred yeres.

               <p>In this maner it is in your les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of charite, the which is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

For syster, what tongue or penne of man can make an ende in tellinge the smallest portion of goddis sub stance? this charitie is god, and God is this charitie.

From the whiche true and entier loue of god, we shulde take a loue with all hertes affecte to the hole kynd of man, in whom beholde spiritually the image of god: For the whiche image sake we shulde beare no lesse fauour to man, than were sufficient to resiste and vtterly vaynquishe all hate, without the remembrance of any grudge to be taken with any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of occasion, to be euer with all men ioyned in harte through our loue in god, as fast as kynred ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a few persons through a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalle

               <p>I thinke well som cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes wyll so say. For I note in the last englysh tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slation of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels out of laten, the translatour alway for <hi>Charitas</hi> wryteth Loue: wherin I canne not consent with hym. For after myn opinion there is as moche difference betwene loue and charite, as is in your oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation betwene threde and twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned threde. For you wyll say, that all twined threde is threde, but al threde is not twyned threde: So this worde Loue is more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men &amp; more general then is charitie. For trouthe it is, that all Charite is loue: but it is not trouth, that all loue is charite. In greke charite is <hi>agape,</hi> and loue is <hi>eros,</hi> as in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine loue is <hi>amor,</hi> and charitie <hi>Chae ritas.</hi> In al these thre tonges there is the same difference in the tone


<pb facs="tcp:5788:32"/>
worde from the tother, that is a penne and a quylle.

Likewyse loue is the common affecte of fauour: charitie is loue reduced into a due order towardes god and man, as to loue god alone for him self, and to loue man for goddes sake.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:5788:33"/>
without reason and mesure: As whan our bodye suffreth any tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we sey, we be in a passion: so when our mynde suffreth any su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che inordinat desires, we haue the myndes passion: and euery suche motion of mynd out of due cours is called a passion.

If al mighty god, the father, wolde gyue to me all giftes of his grace, as to endue me with the holy spirite of prophe cy, to make me a priuie counseilor of al the secrete misteries in heuen, to cause by the power &amp; strengthe of faith to worke wonders, to do miracles, in quickenyng the deed, in geuinge sight to the blinde: yet all this not withstondynge I am not in the way of saluation, If I wante charite.

It is suche a thinge this charitie, that by thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoritie of holy writte I wyl not only cal this vertu a godly thing, but I say it is god hym selfe, that who so euer kepeth in hym chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, he hath god with hym, and he in god dwelleth, that dwelleth in charite.
