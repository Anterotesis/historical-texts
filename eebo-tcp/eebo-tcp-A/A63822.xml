            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Too much desire of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leads a man into a discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented ignorance.

meer <hi>hypocrisie.</hi> The true discerning spirit may behold under this mask, <hi>divided</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, <hi>secret</hi> enmity, <hi>undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> treachery. <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>envy, self-love,</hi> and <hi>pride,</hi> grow up in this rank ground like ill weeds that can never be rooted out notwithstanding the best endeavours of a good Prince.

I cannot misse of <hi>peace</hi>; but these have their <hi>Warre</hi> too, though lesse <hi>bloody,</hi> yet not lesse <hi>cruel.</hi> One School fights with another.

He thinks all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of <hi>Eloquence</hi> is dilated upon the palme of his <hi>hand</hi>; And the other thinks all the strength of reason is contracted into his <hi>fist:</hi> and in this posture they enter the lists.

and are not more angry with <hi>themselves</hi> than with <hi>others</hi> that admire them not, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving every man bound to attend their loud noise with fearful reverence.

Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall I go at last, there is but one harbour left, <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Now certainly I am not farre from my beloved Port.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49164:52"/>
of his own brain. <hi>Difference</hi> in <hi>affection</hi> breeds <hi>division</hi> in <hi>doctrine,</hi> and <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>opinions</hi> drown the power of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>peace.</hi> I will venture once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and search amongst the <hi>Matrimonial</hi> assemblies for a paire of Turtles, an <hi>husband</hi> and a <hi>wife</hi> that will not be separated: whose <hi>love</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to one <hi>family,</hi> to one <hi>fortune,</hi> to one <hi>bed:</hi> who are become <hi>one nature</hi> in a <hi>twofold habit</hi>; the <hi>same person</hi> in a <hi>divided skinne,</hi> a mutual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of <hi>one</hi> heart in <hi>two</hi> souls.

that chollerick matter with a careless smile? How much better is it to <hi>contemne</hi> than <hi>imitate</hi> the folly of another?

The evil which we think to drive away by an indiscreet revenge will return with Usury: and thus we make a reciprocal bargaine of inveterate hatred. When both sides demand satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and neither side will grant it, what can be expected but everlasting discord? what shall be the period of such a controversie? By <hi>repining</hi> at an injury we make it our own;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49164:77"/>
and then it may well hurt the Authour. Who would be willing to do himself a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief? He that loves <hi>himself</hi> cannot hate his <hi>neighbour.</hi> For my own sake I will forbear a revenge; for whatsoever hurt another may suffer thereby, I am sure to feele the smart at home. What unequal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice is this? We can soone forget a great benefit but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lose the remembrance of a small displeasure: and when perhaps the same man had a good intention in both: and when we also have offended in a greater measure. In point of <hi>policy</hi> I will pardon him, that by my example he may be compelled to favour me. Can he expect forgivenesse from <hi>God</hi> that will not forgive
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49164:78"/>
his <hi>neighbour</hi>? We cannot hope for more then we are willing to part with. How can I addresse my selfe to the Throne of grace with any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence or hope of reward, when my own prayers shall prove me a notorious liar? how can I from my heart say, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us as we forgive,</hi>
