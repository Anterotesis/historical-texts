            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

How under pretenſe of a Reformation, all things were turned into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; The Law (which ſhould be the Rule and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection whereby to walk) made uſeless, or at leaſt like
<pb facs="tcp:51922:5"/>
unto a Spiders Webb through which thoſe Rebellious Bug-bears could with eaſe break out, but the poor Caveliers were inſnared in the ſame. How under a pretenſe of the breach of our Fundamental Laws, they Murthered divers Gallant Perſons, when they themſelves committed the greateſt breaches on it, by riding over the Royal Power of the King, putting down the Biſhops, and the Book of Common Prayer, Uſurping the Militia, Counterfeiting the great Seal, Seizing on the Kings Forts, Ports, Shipping, Caſtles, and all his Revenue; Raiſing Rumors, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out Declarations, and giving out words to alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Peoples Affections from their Soveraign; Seſſing Souldiers upon the People of the Kingdom without their Conſent; making Judges, Juſtices, and Sheriffs contrary to the Kings mind, breaking all Law themſelves, and Governing the Land by New-found Ordinances of their own, impoſing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Taxes on the People by wayes never before known in this Kingdom; namely Contributions, Sequestrations, Meal-Money, Sale of Plundred Goods, Loans, Collections upon their Faſt-Dayes; new Impoſition upon Merchandizes, Guards main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at the charge of Private Men, Compoſitions, Sale of Biſhops Lands, with divers other ſtrange Impoſitions, all wracked from the People to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them in their Rebellious Pride; But had they
<pb facs="tcp:51922:5"/>
ſtay'd here, their crimes had been the more inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, but they proceeded to the Murther of their King, and that under a pretenſe of <hi>Juſtice, a Crime ſo great, that Hiſtory cannot ſhew a parallel,</hi> that people profeſſing themſelves <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, Proteſtants,</hi> yea the most Reformed of all the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ſhould in the face of the whole World, in the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the Kingdom, under a formal ſhow of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> Condemn the moſt <hi>Pious, Prudent and Gracious Prince</hi> then living in the whole World, contrary to the Word of God, the Laws of the Land, the Oaths of Supremacy and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiancy, it was a matter of Wonder and Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not only to all Good and Godly <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but even to the very <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now notwithſtanding their ſpecious pretenſes of Religion and Liberty, who can be ſo blind as not plainly to ſee that the main drift of their pretenſes was only to Tyrannize over the People, and to wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in all manner of Pleaſure and Epicuriſme; for how notoriouſly debauched were ſome of the Chief of thoſe Grand Reformers; ſuch as <hi>Gregory Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Henry Martin, Hugh Peters, &amp;c.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their Covetouſness, which was ſo unmeaſurably great, that ſome Wiſe Men have wondered the Kingdome could be able to pay ſo much Money as
<pb facs="tcp:51922:6"/>
hath been Collected from them in a year, and yet for all thoſe immeaſurable Taxes, the Souldiers, and Navy unpaid, that money going towards the Raiſing of their Poor Kindred, many of themſelves, (if not the greatest part) before thoſe Times, of ſo little Account and Eſteem, that they could not Write Gentleman.</p>
            <p>Then that their Pride and Ambition was as great as their Covetouſness, is eaſie to be diſcern'd; for after that Horrid Murther of his Sacred Majeſty, How did thoſe Cocks of the Game peck at one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Ambition never stinting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time he had attained the end of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, Reſolving to ſit in the Seat of Soveraignty, although he waded to the ſame in Blood and Perjury; and thereupon turned out his Rebellious Masters, which he might the more eaſily do, their Horrid Actions having made them ſo notoriouſly odious to all ſorts of People, who rejoyced at their Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall.</p>

him from one degree of Honour to another; till at laſt, he was made Lord Lievtenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in which Government he exceeded all that went before him, in the Careful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the Affairs of that Realm, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming the <hi>Iriſh</hi> from many of their Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Cuſtomes, and reducing them to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> civility, ſuppreſſing their Out-Lawes and Tories, and bringing them to perfect, entire Obedience to the Kings Authority and Laws. He much advanced the Proteſtant Religion, and ſetled a conſtant Revenue for the Clergy of that Kingdom, and made ſo good a procedure in what he undertook, that had not thoſe Diſloyal Times of Confuſion fallen out, no doubt he had attained his Ends, and ſetled that Kingdom in a moſt flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scotch</hi> War (being the Prologue to all our late Troubles) breaking out, he was ſent for out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to Adviſe with the King about thoſe Troubles, which ſo unpreparedly had ſurprized him; To which work he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed his Head, Hands and Purſe, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing by ſubſcription Twenty Thouſand Pound, as a Coppy for the reſt of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to write after: In this Expedition he was made Lievtenant General, and was very
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51922:9"/>
eager to Fight with the <hi>Scots</hi>; But the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> being defeated at <hi>Newborn,</hi> and Petitions ſucceeding for an accommodation, a Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion followed, and ſoon after that, a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was Summoned by the Adviſe of this Earle, and the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi>; where the very firſt thing of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence that was done, was a Charge of High Treaſon Exhibited againſt this Earle by the Houſe of Commons, conſiſting of Twenty Eight Articles, whereupon, he was Sequeſtred from ſitting as a Peer, and ſoon after committed to the Uſher of the Black Rod, and ſo to the Tower. His Tryal quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after enſued, which was done with great Solemnity in <hi>Weſtminster-Hall,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Arundal</hi> being Lord High Steward: The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Articles were, <hi>That he had En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſubvert the Fundamental Lawes and Governments of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland: <hi>That he had done ill Offices betwixt the</hi> King <hi>and the</hi> Scots, <hi>and betwixt the</hi> King <hi>and his</hi> Subjects <hi>of this Kingdom: That he had Adviſed the</hi> King <hi>to bring up the Army out of the</hi> North, <hi>and over-awe the Parliament: And that he had informed his Majeſty that he had an Army of Ten Thouſand Men in</hi> Ireland, <hi>ready to be Tranſported for the ſame Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:</hi> His Accuſers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were <hi>Pym,</hi> St. <hi>Johns,

Whitlock,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Earles,</hi> Serjant <hi>Glyn, May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, Stroud,</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden, Hambden, &amp;c.</hi> But the Earle defended himſelf ſo Bravely and Learnedly, that the Lords, Conſcious of his Innocency, would not find the Bill; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Commons ſeeing they could not ſpeed that way, drew up a Bill of Attainder, and preſented it to the Lords, declaring the matter of Fact to have been ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and that as to Law, he had incurred the Cenſure of Treaſon; But the Lords adjudged this a ſtrange way of Proceeding, unſutable to their own Safety, and againſt Common Juſtice; Whereupon the <hi>Londoners</hi> came down in Tumults, ſtopped the Lords Coaches, menacing to poſt up the Names of thoſe who favoured him under the Title of <hi>Straffor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> and with an impetuous Cry of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, frighted many of the Peers to aſſent to the Bill; ſo hard a task had his Blood-thirſty Enemies to bereave him of his Life, which yet notwithſtanding paſſed but by the plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Seven Voices againſt him.</p>
               <p>But the hardeſt matter was to get the Kings aſſent, who very much declined it, and in a ſet Speech, cleared the Earle from any deſign of Treaſon, or conſulting to any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Government; But being over-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51922:10"/>
by the dangers that were repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as inevitable conſequents of his refuſal; but principally being deſired by the Earle himſelf to ſatisfie the Parliament, though with his own blood; His Majeſty after Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe with the Biſhops, ſigned that Fatal Bill, which afterwards proved the Axe againſt his own Life.</p>
               <p>Thus fell this Noble Earle, being one of the Chief Pillars and Baſis of this Nation, without whoſe Ruine the Grandees of the Faction knew it a hard matter to Effect or Accompliſh any thing; ſuch an Abſolute, Rare, Honeſt and Loyal Maſter-Piece of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Prudence, as this preſent Age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaw not, and well will it be for the next, if it may compare and parallel him.

ſaying, <hi>Though it had pleaſed his Sacred</hi> Majeſty, <hi>that now is, to make him one of the Knights of the most Honourable Order of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet he did not think himſelf more Honoured by the Garter, then by that Cord and Book, which he would embrace about his neck with as much joy and content, as ever he did the Garter, or a Chain of Gold</hi>; and therefore deſired them to tye them about him as they pleaſed, telling them, <hi>That what they thought was for his Diſgrace, he took to be his greateſt Honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being done, and his Armes tyed, he asked the Officers, <hi>If they had any more Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour (as they conceived it) to put upon him, he was ready to accept it</hi>; and ſo with an undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Courage mounted the top of that prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Gibbet, where having commended his ſoul to God, he patiently underwent the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of their inveterate malice.</p>

            <p n="1">I. THe Lord <hi>Finch</hi> of <hi>Fordwich,</hi> Lord Keeper of the Great Seal; a Perſon whoſe Abilities, and Loyalty to his Sacred Majeſty rendred him obnoxious to the unruly rabble; and therefore upon their Arbitrary Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

againſt the Life of the moſt Noble Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> he wiſely with-drew himſelf away in time, before Popular Fury had ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on him, againſt which Beaſt; Innocency would not then give Protection. He lived in Baniſhment and Exile from his Native Country for Sixteen years, and then returned with more Credit and Honour then he was forced from it, dying in the Love, and good Opinion of all Honeſt People; His Faithfull Service to his Soveraign being all the Charge and Accuſation they had againſt him.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Maſter Secretary <hi>Windebanck,</hi> a perſon of approved Worth and Loyalty, againſt whom the darts of Popular Fury were in thoſe times of Diſtraction eſpecially aymed at, which to avoid, he purſued the ſame courſe with the Lord <hi>Finch,</hi> and died in the time of his abſence abroad.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Right Reverend Father in God, <hi>Mathew</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> who with Eleven more of that Sacred Function, were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Tower</hi> in the year of our Lord, 1641.

Faction buzzed into the Peoples eares, that their Quarrel was againſt the Litturgy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Ceremonies and the like a yet their after-Actions made it plainly appear, that it was more againſt Biſhops Lands; and that the Wealth of the Clergy was more in their ayme, then the Weal the Subjects; and the Riches of the Prelates more indifferent to thoſe ſtrict Diſciplinaries, then a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend decency in holy performances. Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years did this Reverend Father ſuffer Impriſonment in the <hi>Tower,</hi> having in all that time no Charge exhibited againſt him; but in the end of the year, 1659. he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to his liberty by the means of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> and is ſince Re-eſtabliſhed in his former Dioceſs, to the Honour and Support of this reſtored Church.</p>

Religious Doctor <hi>Featly,</hi> one moſt Eminent for Learning and Piety, to whom this Church is much indebted for his grave accurate defences of its Doctrine and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, a man of excellent Endowments, and ſurpaſſing Knowledge, being a Divine of the Primitive ſtamp and temper, when the Church by lowlineſs of ſpirit did flouriſh in high examples; yet could not this his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Piety, eminent Learning; nor thoſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51922:47"/>
other extraordinary Gifts with which he was Endowed, privilege him from the protection of a Priſon, being by an Order of Parliament committed to <hi>Peter-Houſe,</hi> where he langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in much pain and miſery about a year and a half; and was afterwards (ſickneſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing) through much importunity remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to <hi>Chelſey Colledge,</hi> as a more wholeſome Aire; but he was ſo far ſpent by their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous miſuſage of him, that within three weeks after his coming thither, he died.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Sir <hi>Robert Heath,</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi> a perſon much Honoured for his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and Moderation, and as conſpicuous for his conſtant Loyalty, as the Sun in the Firmament in a ſerene day. His conſtant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved ſervice to the King had rendered him ſo odious to the Rebells at <hi>Westminſter,</hi> that he was by them excepted from mercy; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore towards the expiration of the War, he abandoned his Country, and fled into <hi>France,</hi> where living in great greef and anxiety of mind to behold the Ruines of his King and Country, he fell into a Diſeaſe, and died thereof at <hi>Caen</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> not long after the Kings death.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Judge <hi>Bartlet,</hi> whoſe innocency de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their threats, and like a rock ſtood in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition

againſt that torrent of Rebellion; but yet was forced at laſt to yield to their Tyranny in his Body, though his Mind they could not conquer; He was the firſt of that Reverend Robe that was committed, againſt whom was brought a Charge, fuller of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice then truth, and which his integrity made them aſhamed of a further proſecution: Thus we ſee (by the Impriſonment of this Reverend Judge, and others) that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe of our Grand Reformers, was to put out the eyes of the Law, that the Subjects might ſee the clearer.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. That heart of Oake, and Pillar of the Law, Judge <hi>Jenkins,</hi> one of his Majeſties Juſtices in <hi>Wales,</hi> whoſe Annagram is, <hi>David Jenkins, Kains did Envy.</hi> He was for ſome miſdemeanours of Loyalty, brought to the Bar in Chancery, where he denyed the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Court, becauſe their Seal was contrary to Law, as well as their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners; and ſo baffled thoſe puny Judges, that inſtead of a further proſecution there, they committed him Priſoner to the <hi>Tower,</hi> where he gave further Demonſtrations of his Loyalty, by publiſhing ſeveral Preſidents and Statutes, wherein he proved them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells and Traytors, and owned the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51922:48"/>
at other Bars: So that he did more miſchief to the Enemies of the Royal Cauſe with his Pen, then their beſt Regiment could do with their Swords. He uſed his utmoſt endeavour to ſet the Parliament and Army at ods, thereby to promote the Kings Cauſe, according to that well known maxime, <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and Conquer,</hi> defying them and their threats, and aſſerting the King and the Laws againſt their Uſurpation. He was kept a cloſe Priſoner a long time in the <hi>Tower,</hi> where wearied of him by his indefatigable induſtry in the Kings Cauſe, he was remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from thence to <hi>Windſor,</hi> where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the ſame quality, and of the ſame mind, till without thanks to them he was permitted the liberty of the Town; and hath ſurvived to ſee the Return of Majeſty, the Reſtauration of the Laws, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Subjects reſtored to them again in as ample a manner as it was before.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. That Valiant, Loyal Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> Sir <hi>Ralph,</hi> afterwards Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> whoſe Courage and Prudence in the management of the Kings Affairs, (for whom he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the <hi>West</hi>) did gaine him the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of an Expert Captain, and Gallant Commander, having his Endeavours

Crowned with many notable Succeſſes. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Diſbanding in <hi>Cornwall</hi> (Rebellion then flouriſhing with a high hand) he took ſhipping with the Prince, our now Gracious Soveraign, and with him Sailed into the <hi>Iſland</hi> of <hi>Scilly,</hi> and from thence into the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> following the Kings hard fortune in his Peregrinations, till death in the end put a period to his Travells, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Troubleſome life, he found a quiet Grave at the City of <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>

            <p n="9">IX. Maſter Secretary, Sir <hi>Edward Nicholas,</hi> who conſtantly and faithfully adhered to his Majeſty from the beginning of his Troubles, being a great Prop to the Royal Cauſe, by his Prudent Counſells, and Great Abilities in the Management of the moſt Difficult Affairs; and afterwards continued the ſame Service and Office to our preſent Soveraign, in all his Troubles and Negotiations abroad, having with great Faithfulneſs and Pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy Managed that Employment all along, to the happy Effect of his Majeſties Glorious Reſtitution.</p>
            <p n="10">X. Sir <hi>Edward Hide,</hi> ſince the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Earle of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> and Lord Chancellour to his preſent Majeſty, of whoſe Worth and Abilities to ſpeak, were to cry

            <p n="9">XI. The Lord <hi>Wilnot,</hi> afterwards by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second made Earle of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> being Raiſed thereunto by his ſuperlative Deſerts, not only by his Valour which ſhone tranſcendent clear at <hi>Round-way-down</hi> neer the <hi>Devizes</hi>; but alſo in his (prudent carriage in that grand Affair, concerning the Kingdoms happineſs, in his Majeſties Miraculous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape from <hi>Worceſter</hi>; He died a little before the Kings Reſtitution, not ſurviving to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of thoſe Grandeurs, whereof his Abilities would have made him a deſerved Sharer.</p>
            <p n="12">
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:51922:50"/>XII. The Right Reverend Doctor <hi>Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> whoſe Deſerts and Sufferings advanced him upon the Reſtauration of his Majeſty to be Lord Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> ſince by the death of Doctor <hi>Juxon,</hi> (as none more able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his place) to the Arch-Biſhoprick of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> Primate and Metropolitan of all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> of whoſe Abilities to ſpeak, were to ſhow the light of the Sun by a Candle; Let it ſuffice, that his very Name is enough to ſtrike Envy dead, and to put to ſilence the moſt obſtinate Heretick, and riged Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick upon the face of the whole Earth.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. The Religiouſly Loyall Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> a conſtant aſſertor of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liturgy, and one whoſe Abilities rendred him dear to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr; to whom Impriſonment was no ſtranger, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time Rebellion was Rampant, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting every day for his Loyalty to have been tranſported, yet would never yield nor deviate from thoſe wayes wherein Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience aſcertain'd him he was in the right, though not the predominate ſide.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale,</hi> afterwards Lord <hi>Langdale,</hi> whoſe Abilities in Martiall Affairs, would in the time of Paganiſm have deified him the God of Battel, though in

our times his conſtant Loyalty had rendred him to a higher pitch of Honour, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly accounted a Pylot for all Noble and Gallant Spirits whereby to direct and ſteer their Courſe.</p>
            <p n="15">XV.

               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:51922:51"/>XVII.

            <p n="18">XVIII. Sir <hi>John Berkenhead,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whoſe Worth and Deſerts are too high for me to deliniate; He was a conſtant Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of his Majeſties Cauſe in its loweſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, and ſuffered for the ſame ſeveral Impriſonments; I ſhall ſpeak no more in his Commendation, whoſe own Pen hath ſo ſufficiently diſplay'd its ſelf, that he who is ignorant thereof, muſt plead ignorance both to Wit and Learning.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. Doctor <hi>Barwick,</hi> a Reverend Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Divine, who for his Loyalty was by an Order of the Long Parliament committed Priſoner to the <hi>Tower,</hi> where he lay untill ſuch time he was neer famiſhed, when Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Weſt</hi> the then Lievtenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> permitted him his liberty on Parol to render himſelf at a prefixed time ſoon after, which he accordingly performed; after the Liev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants death, his Wife gained him his Conge, and ſet him at perfect Freedome, there being nothing of Accuſation againſt

This Reverend Doctor ſurvived to ſee the flouriſhing again of Epiſcopacy, and was by his Sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty made Dean of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> in which place he continued till the month of <hi>October,</hi> 1664. when (like <hi>Abraham</hi>) he was gathered to his Fathers <hi>a good man, and full of dayes.</hi>

            <p n="20">XX.

            <p n="22">XXII. Sir <hi>John Owen,</hi> that undaunted piece of <hi>Welſh</hi> Loyalty, whoſe endeavours for the King in that Country, were truly Honourable, though not crowned with that ſucceſſe as ſuch a Cauſe merrited. This Loyal Gentleman, was at their <hi>High Court of Injuſtice</hi> condemned to death, together with Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Lord <hi>Capel, &amp;c.</hi> but by the mercy of the Parliament, (rare and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) he was Reprieved.</p>
            <p n="23">XXIII. The Earle of <hi>Norwich,</hi> the Lord <hi>Loughborough,</hi> Sir <hi>Bernard Gaſcoigne,</hi> Colonel <hi>Far, &amp;c.</hi> theſe Heroick Perſons were all Engaged in the Deſign at <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> where having ſuffer'd a ſharp and bitter Siege, after the rendition of the Town, they had by the barbarity of thoſe Rebells all of them ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed death, had not ſome of them made their eſcapes, and the reſt give in ſuch Pleas as would have freed them out of the hands of the moſt bloody Cannibals in the world.</p>
            <p n="24">XXIV. Should I next go about to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate all thoſe Excellent Perſons who were forced out of their Fellowſhips, and other Collegiate Emoluments in both Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,

it would be a Task too large for ſo ſmall a Volumne;

Such barbarity being uſed towards them, as may make Poſterity to tremble at the thought of it, I ſhall therefore paſs over that ſad ſtory and beadroll, deſiring to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, though I give not to every perſon a due Character for their Loyalty in Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="25">XXV.

            <p n="26">XXVI. Next I might make a record of that black Bill and Liſt againſt ſeveral of the Nobility and Gentry, which paſſed againſt them for an Act of Parliament, by which their Eſtates were forfeited for Loyalty, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51922:53"/>
appointed to be ſold by Truſtees of their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; thus though they could not come at to eat the bird, they would be ſure to pluck off all his feathers.</p>

            <p n="1">I. <hi>JOhn Cook,</hi> the Solicitor of that High Court of Injuſtice, a man of great Parts, had he not imployed them to foul purpoſes; He was a <hi>Grays-Inn</hi> Gentleman, but in a poor and wanting condition, before he undertook this moſt Scelerate piece of Service; His indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency by ſome charitable opinions being the greateſt motive that induced him unto it, and ſo did it not out of <hi>Malice,</hi> but <hi>Avarice,</hi> as he himſelf Alleadged at his Tryal; Thus we ſee what a narrow Fortune, and the ſtreights of Debt, and the Devils wide World, and vaſt Preferments can tempt a man to: After this horrid Paricide, he was by his Fellow Regicides greatly Advanced, eſpecially in <hi>Ireland,</hi> of which he was made
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51922:80"/>
Lord Chancellour, and from whence after his Majeſties return he was ſent into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> to be Tryed his for his Treaſons, which was done accordingly at <hi>Juſtice-Hall</hi> in the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> where he ſhewed very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and reverence to the Court, behaving himſelf to the removal of that prejudice which the Generality had of him, as of a Monſter. He was for his Horrid Treaſons Condemned to be Hanged, Drawn, and Quartered, which was accordingly Executed upon him, <hi>October</hi> 16. 1660. at the Place where <hi>Charing-Cross</hi> formerly ſtood; His Head was ſet on a Pole on the North-Eaſt end of <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> and his Quarters on the Gates of the City.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Hugh Peters,</hi> An Antique in Religion, the ſhame of the Clergy, a Pulpit Buffoon, <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Chaplain and Jeſter, to tell Stories, and make the People laugh; a moſt Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous abominable Fellow, the Trumpet to this Pagantry <hi>High Court of Juſtice,</hi> and the moſt unparallel'd Eccleſiaſtick in all Stories and Times; Who like Doctor <hi>Shaw</hi> in the time of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Third (but more ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs) was employed to cry down the King, and to cry up the Protector; He was a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal in the Cabal for the Murther of the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51922:81"/>
King, whoſe Death he contrived in five ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, (<hi>viz.</hi>) at <hi>Ware, Windſor, Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-ſtreet,</hi> the <hi>Painted-Chamber,</hi> and <hi>Bradſhaws Houſe,</hi> comparing the King in his Sermon to <hi>Barrabas,</hi> and in another, the Text where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was to <hi>Bind Kings in Chains, &amp;c.</hi> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that there was an Act of Gods own making, <hi>That they that ſpilt mans blood by man ſhould their blood be ſpilt,</hi> and that out of that Law, neither the <hi>King,</hi> nor <hi>Prince,</hi> nor <hi>Prince Rupert,</hi> nor none of that <hi>Rabble</hi> were except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Upon the return of the King, being conſcious of his own guilt, he hid his head, but his lurking place was found out, and he taken in the Burrough of <hi>Southwark,</hi> where at firſt he denied his Name, but being brought before Sir <hi>John Robinſon</hi> then made Lievtenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> he was known, and acknowledged himſelf, where he was kept Priſoner till ſuch time as his Tryal, which was <hi>October</hi> 13. 1660. at which time it is very remarkable, that this Perſon, who by his Function as a Prieſt had moſt diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God in Preaching, and preſſing this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticide, making uſe of his Holy Writ to this wicked purpoſe, had then nothing to ſay, but to cavil at the Witneſſes, and that he was ſorry to hear of his carriage towards the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51922:81"/>
King (we may believe him) but he had no malice towards him, but was meerly Enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the Army; He was condemned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Cook,</hi> and with him <hi>October</hi> 16. Drawn on Two Hurdles to Execution, where the miſerable Wretch had not a word to ſay for himſelf, or to God, of whom he ſaid he was abandoned: He that was ſo nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and quick in all projects in this nature before, was now like a Sot or a Fool, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and toying with the ſtraw in the Sledge as he went to Execution, nay, ſo ſtupid was he, that the Hangman was forced to uſe more then ordinary ſtrength to throw him off the Ladder; being almoſt hanged dead, he was cut down and Quarter'd, his Head ſet upon <hi>London-Bridge,</hi> and his Quarters expoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the tops of ſome of the City Gates.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Daniel Axtell,</hi> who at firſt kept a Country Pedling-ſhop in <hi>Bedford-ſhire,</hi> and was double diligent in running after Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Perſons, who then vented Treaſon in Pulpits; and believing their Doctrine for currant, obey'd the Call (as he called it) of thoſe blind Guides, and went forth a ſmall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Officer to fight againſt the Mighty; His great Induſtry in their Service, brought him after many Traverſes, to be a Lievtenant
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51922:82"/>
Colonel; and employed by <hi>Cromwel</hi> out of Favour to him as he ſaid (though the Devil could not have done him a greater Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteſie) to be Captain of the Guard at the Kings Tryal, where to ſhow his Complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to their Commands, he made his Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by blows and threats, to cry out Juſtice, and Execution; much more blood had he contracted to his guilt, (though none com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to this) in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and had as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his Villanies, gotten a pretty foul Eſtate; but wickedneſs ſeldome proſpers long, upon the Kings return, he was one of thoſe Perſons exempted by the Parliament out of the Act of Indempnity, and for his Treaſons brought to a Tryal at <hi>Juſtice-Hall</hi> in the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> where notwithſtanding, he pleaded for himſelf with more Art and Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningneſs then was imagined to be found in him, yet were his Crimes ſo Notorious as not to be covered with ſuch Fig-leaves; He was therefore by the Jury found Guilty, and Sentenced to be Hanged, Drawn, and Quartered, which was accordingly Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on him at <hi>Tyburn, October</hi> the 19. 1660. His Head fixed on a Pole at the furtheſt end of <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> and his Quarters a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle on the City Gates.</p>

               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:51922:82"/>IV. Doctor <hi>Doriſlaus,</hi> A <hi>Dutch</hi> School-Maſter, who for ſome miſdemeanours fled his Country, and here became Civillian, afterwards a profeſſor in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> where being diſappointed of his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Expectations, the War then on foot, he became the Parliaments Judge Advocate in their Army, by which he much better'd his broken Fortunes, and became a great Aſſociate of Sir <hi>Henry Mildmay</hi>'s, (who though raiſed by the King, was one of his greateſt Enemies,) who promoted him to that buſineſs of drawing up a Charge againſt the King, the Horrid Nature thereof being ſuch, that no <hi>Engliſhman</hi> durſt find, or make a way to ſuch an Illegal, and unprecedented buſineſs. After the perpetration of that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Murther, he was lookt upon by the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides for his Abilities, as a fit perſon to be ſent over as an Envoy to his Country-men, to proſecute the Deſignes of the Faction, which would carry the better face, being managed by one of their own Subjects: He Arrived there in <hi>May,</hi> with great Pomp and Attendance, in his Coach with Six Horſes before, and Vengeance behind; for the firſt night, as he was at Supper there, one Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Whitford</hi> a <hi>Scotch-man,</hi> with ſome
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51922:83"/>
Twelve other Caveliers, diſdaining the King ſhould be affronted by the impudent boldneſs of ſuch an Audacious Traytor,) enter'd his Lodging, and with a broad Sword cleft his Head and killed him, having by a miſtake wounded another <hi>Dutch-Man</hi> for him at their firſt coming in; and having done the deed, they quietly departed, it not being known (but privately) for a long time after who did it.</p>
            <p>To this we may adjoyn that of <hi>Aſchams,</hi> another great confident of the Regicides, who being ſent their Envoy to <hi>Spain,</hi> ſome little while after, was ſerved in the ſame manner at his Arrival at <hi>Madrid,</hi> in his Inn, by one <hi>Sparks,</hi> and ſome other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts upon the ſame ſcore; <hi>Sparks</hi> having done the deed, fled to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours for ſhelter, but judging that not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure enough, he betook himſelf to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, from whence he was by the cunning Don, to curry Favour with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides, then dreadfull to his Plate-Trade, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thence, and with great pitty, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, at the meanneſs of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> was Executed for the ſame.</p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>Daniel Broughton,</hi> A Clark bred up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Committees of War, where he
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51922:83"/>
became ſo Principled, as he was judged fit, and preferred to be Chief Scribe to this Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſaicall Murtherous Crue of the <hi>High Court of Juſtice</hi>; for which Guilt, upon his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Return, immagining his Crime too great to be forgiven, he ran away, and in Forreign Countries diſguiſed hides his hated head.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>Edward Dendy,</hi> Serjant at Armes to the ſaid curſed Court, who had before outed his Father from the Employment of the Mace; no marvel then, that ſuch a Rebel to his Father, ſhould prove a Parricide to his Prince; He likewiſe fled the Land upon his Majeſties Return, to preſerve his forfeited life from the Hangman.</p>
            <p n="7-8">VII, and VIII. Sir <hi>Henry Mildmay,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Robert Wallop,</hi> who had Sat as Judges in that <hi>High Court of Iuſtice,</hi> although not Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced nor Signed to the Warrant for his Execution; The firſt of theſe was one who had been raiſed by his Majeſty, though moſt ungratefully (the worſt of Vices) he Acted with a high hand againſt him; but divine Vengeance at laſt overtook him, and the Iron hand of Juſtice delivered him to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment (though not ſo great as his deſerts) due to that grand Impiety, <hi>Ianuary</hi> 30. 1661.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51922:84"/>
They were on Sledges drawn from the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> through the City, with Halters about their necks to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> where having threaded that triple Tree, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in the ſame Equipage back to the <hi>Tower,</hi> there to ſuffer perpetual Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their Eſtates Confiſcated, and they Degraded from all Titles and Armes of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>James Harrington</hi> was to have ſuffered the like puniſhment, but he having his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty upon Bail from the Serjant at Armes, gave them the ſlip, and moſt unworthily left his Bail in the lurch. <hi>Phelps</hi> alſo one of the Clarks of that Court, was marked out for this Puniſhment, but not Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
            <p n="9">IX.

mark of the Juſt Judgement and Vengeance of God upon that deteſtable Fact, and their no leſs abominable mockery of him as the Authour thereof in this their Irreligious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of that Fatal Providence, as they razed this Feſtival out of their Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, which was attended with ſo ill an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p n="10">X.

            <p n="11">XI. Sir <hi>Thomas Martin,</hi> A Knight of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge-ſhire,</hi> a great ſtickler for the Times, and a ſworn Enemy of the Royaliſts; who having been a Hunting in <hi>Holmby-Park,</hi> at the opening of a <hi>Deer</hi> he was deſired (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſome other Gentlemen) to waſh his hands in the <hi>Deeres</hi> blood, No (ſaid he) <hi>I had rather waſh my hands in the blood of the Young King of Scots</hi>; but obſerve the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment that attended this Impious wiſh,

as he was riding home the ſame Evening, his Horſe threw him, in which fall he pitcht on his head, mortally brake his Scull and Shoulder, and died ſhortly after of thoſe wounds.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. Sir <hi>Henry Holcroft,</hi> A grand Pillar of the Independant Faction, a Committee Gentleman, and one who Acted very ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly for the Rump, hoping to be a great ſharer in the ſpoyle of the Kingdome; but Man propoſes, and God diſpoſes, for it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lord that he fell into a ſore Diſeaſe, bleeding abundantly at the noſe and mouth, and at laſt fell to a ſtrong vomitting up of gobbetts of blood at his mouth, and ſuch abundance of blood flowed with mighty violence at his noſe, that in a moſt ſad man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he departed this life, in one of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream-fits thereof.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. To theſe we may add Colonel <hi>Rainſbrough,</hi> a prime ſtickler for the Power at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and a deſparate Enemy againſt the King, who though he was killed before the Horrid Murther of his Majeſty, yet the manner of his Death being ſo remarkable, is not to be paſſed over in ſilence.

            <p n="14">XIV. One <hi>Marſton,</hi> a great Leveller and Agitator in the Army, a ſort of People ſuſpected many of them, and that rationally for Jeſuites, who were as good at wicked Plots and Contrivances, as either <hi>Cromwell,</hi> or <hi>Ireton,</hi> or the chief of thoſe <hi>Catalines</hi> and as accompliſht for Execution, having ſuch Lawleſs, yet moſt Powerfull Indempnity not only to protect them, but to ſhroud their other Conſpiracies for themſelves either againſt Church or State.

firing in the Rear at a Trained Band of Yellow who cloſely purſued them; at laſt they took in at the Blew Anchor Ale-Houſe by the Poſtern, which Houſe they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with much deſparate courage, and would not hear of any Termes of Yielding; ſoon after came Lievtenant Colonel <hi>Cox</hi> with his Company and ſurrounded all places about it, and then ſome of the Souldiers got up upon the Tilings of the next Houſe, which they caſt down, and fired into the uppermoſt Room where the Rebells were, yet were they ſo deſparately bent in their wickedneſs, that even then they refuſed Quarter, untill a File of Muſqueteers got up the Stairs, and having ſhot down the door, entered upon them, ſix of them being killed, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other wounded, yet one of them ſtill refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Quarter, who being knockt down with the But end of a Muſquet, was afterwards ſhot; the reſt yielded, who being demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, why they craved not Quarter before, Anſwered, <hi>They durſt not for fear their owne Fellows ſhould ſhoot them,</hi> of ſuch a deſparate reſolution was the temper of their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
            <p>In this Rebellious Inſurrection were ſlain alike of both ſides, <hi>Twenty Two</hi> of the Kings
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51922:89"/>
Leige People, and <hi>Twenty Two</hi> of the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. <hi>Twenty One</hi> more beſides were taken, whoſe Names were as followeth, (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Thomas Venner,</hi> their Chief Ring-leader, the Captain of this Rebellious Rout; The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to <hi>Venner</hi> were one <hi>Tuffnel</hi> a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter living in <hi>Grays-Inn-lane,</hi> a deſparate Fellow, who after He and his Party were forced over the Houſes through <hi>More-lane,</hi> they fled into the Fields, and he having four or five Piſtolls about him, diſcharged them all before he could be got down; but at laſt he was ſo mortally wounded, that they brought him in a Chair to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and ſo they ſent him to <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> Hoſpital, where after three dayes ſpace he dyed of his wounds, and was carried into <hi>Chriſt-Church-Yard,</hi> for to be viewed, to ſee if any body would own him; but a hole being digged the Blew Coat Boyes covered him with the Earth, and he was never further lookt after. The next was <hi>Roger Hodgkins,</hi> a Button-Sellor in St. <hi>Clements Lane</hi> neer <hi>Lumbard ſtreet; Giles Pritcherd,</hi> a Cow-keeper, <hi>Leonard Gowler, Jonas Allen, John Pym, William Orſingham, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Aſhton, Stephen Fall, John Smith, William Corbet, John Dod, Iohn Eleſtone, Thomas Harris, Iohn Gardener, Robert Bradley, Richard Marten,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51922:90"/>
Iohn Patſhall, Robert Hopkins,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Wells.</hi> Theſe <hi>Twenty</hi> and <hi>One</hi> were all brought to the Bar together, <hi>Tuffnel</hi> excepted; (their Tryal ſucceeding ſoon after their Deſparate En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement) where the wounded Men had Chairs allowed them to ſit down in, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Indictment was read, which was laid both to Treaſon and Murther; <hi>Thomas Venner</hi> was firſt called, who being asked Guilty or not Guilty, ran out into a wild Diſcourſe about his Converſation in <hi>New-England,</hi> and concerning the Fifth Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and the Teſtimony within him above theſe Twenty years. He confeſſed, <hi>He was in the late Riſing, but was not Guilty of Treaſon, intending not to Leavy War againſt the King</hi>; and again ran out into impertinent Stories and Diſcourſes as before; but being preſſed by the Court to Anſwer to his Indictment, he pleaded <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> and for his Tryal put himſelf upon God and the Country. In the like manner all the reſt uſed many rambling diverſions from the buſineſs, but at laſt pleaded to their Indictments: Whereupon the Witneſſes were ſworn, who made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that <hi>Venner, Tuffnel,</hi> and <hi>Crag,</hi> (the two laſt being killed in the buſineſs) <hi>Did ſeveral times perſwade their Congregation to take up Arms
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51922:90"/>
for King Ieſus, againſt the Powers of the Earth,</hi> (which were his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the <hi>General, &amp;c.</hi>) <hi>That they were to Kill all that oppoſed them: That they had been Praying and Preaching, but not Acting for God: That they Armed themſelves at their Meeting-Houſe in Coleman-ſtreet, with Blunder-buſſes, Muſquets, &amp;c. Marten, Hopkins, Wells,</hi> and <hi>Patſhall,</hi> the Witneſſes being not ſo clear againſt them, were acquitted by the Jury, the other <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen</hi> were found Guilty, and being brought to the Bar, were demanded to ſhew cauſe why Sentence of Death ſhould not paſs upon them? which they not doing, they were all <hi>Sixteen</hi> Condemned to be Hanged, Drawn, and Quartered. The Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Foſter</hi> charging <hi>Venner</hi> with the blood of his Complices, by his Seduction and Leading of them, he Anſwered, <hi>He did not</hi>; to which the Witneſſes being produced again, he blaſphemouſly evaded it with this quible, and ſaid, <hi>It was not He, but Ieſus that Led Them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to the Sentence pronounced on them <hi>Ianuary</hi> 19. 1661. <hi>Venner</hi> and <hi>Hodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings</hi> (both deſparately wounded in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and as yet uncured) were Drawn on Sledges from <hi>Newgate</hi> through <hi>Cheap-ſide,</hi>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:51922:91"/>
over againſt their Meeting Houſe in <hi>Swan-Alley</hi> in <hi>Coleman-ſtreet,</hi> where they were Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted according to the Sentence pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt them. <hi>Venner</hi> (according to the nature of moſt deſparate Traytors) vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Himſelf and his Fact, being confident he ſaid, <hi>That the time was at hand when other judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be, reflecting much upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>: But if the one was mad, the other raved, <hi>Hodgkins</hi> in way of Praying, <hi>Calling down Vengeance from Heaven upon the King, the Iudges, and the City of London</hi>; nor would he leave, until the Hangman by the Sheriff's or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der turn'd him off the Ladder; ſo that as they lived in a mad Religion, they died as madly in the ſame: Their Quarters were ſet upon the Four Gates of the City, by the late Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted Regicides, whoſe quarrel and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge they undertook, in this deſparate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and their Heads upon Poles as loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſome of them on <hi>London-Bridge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame day <hi>Giles Pritchard,</hi> a <hi>Cow-keeper,</hi> and another of them were Executed in <hi>Cheap-ſide,</hi> and on the Munday following, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 21. of <hi>Ian. Nine</hi> more of them were Executed at five ſeveral places, (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Two</hi> at the Weſt end of St. <hi>Pauls, Two</hi> at the <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Mouth</hi> in St. <hi>Martins, Two</hi> at <hi>Beech-lane,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:51922:91"/>
Two</hi> at the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> and <hi>One</hi> a notable Fellow named <hi>Leonard Gowler</hi> at <hi>Biſhopſgate.</hi> They all (eſpecially the laſt) obſtinately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in their Errour, only a young man who was Hanged in <hi>Redcross-street,</hi> did relent and repent of his ſin, and the blood he had ſpilt, but yet could not be perſwaded out of his opinion of Chilianiſme.</p>
            <p>Thus this deſparate attempt ended in a halter, and their Declaration called <hi>A door of Hope opened,</hi> proved to be a trap door, to draw ſilly ſouls to deſtruction. I ſhall here add thoſe Verſes made under <hi>Venners</hi> picture, as being pertinent to this purpoſe, and ſo take my leave of them.
<q>
                  <l>His Helmet was a Crown by Revelation,</l>
                  <l>His Halbert was a Scepter for the Nation;</l>
                  <l>So the Fifth Monarchy anew is grac'd,</l>
                  <l>King <hi>Venner</hi> next to <hi>John</hi> a <hi>Leydon</hi> plac'd.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe we may add one <hi>John James,</hi> a Small-cole-man by Trade, a rank Fifth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchiſt, and one who had been engaged in <hi>Venners</hi> buſines, but was abſent, or had ſaved himſelf the laſt day they broke out; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that fair warning, departed not from his malice, but continued his Meetings
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51922:92"/>
and Conventicles with others of his deſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Crue, amongſt whom he was a principal Rabby or Teacher. This man, as <hi>Venner</hi> had done before him, and as was couched in their Declaration, flew out into ſeveral Traytor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Speeches and Invectives againſt the Kings Perſon, Government, and Family, which being over-heard by ſome Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours living near, <hi>James</hi> was ſeized upon, and carried before a Juſtice, who committed him to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and the next Terme was brought to a Tryal at the <hi>Kings Bench-Bar,</hi> where the words were proved againſt him, and he convicted and condemned as a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. <hi>November</hi> 27. 1661. He was drawn on a Sledge from <hi>Newgate</hi> to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> ſome of his Sect throwing themſelves into the ſame Sledge, and embracing him, ſo highly opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionated were they of this their ſilly though bold Seducer. At the Gallows he denied the words, but owned and avowed his Chilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme, and the Perſonal Reign of Chriſt, and with the uſuall confidence of his Party reſolutely died. His Quarters were diſpoſed of by his Majeſties Orders, and his Head fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a Pole in <hi>White-Chappel,</hi> neer to their Meeting Houſe, for an Example to his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:51922:92"/>Yet could not the ill ſucceſs of theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage others from Plots againſt his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, but ſtill new Treaſons was hatched by the Rebellious Spirits of one Captain <hi>Baker,</hi> a <hi>New-England</hi> man, and great acquaintance of <hi>Hugh Peters,</hi> who preferred him to be one of <hi>Olivers</hi> Penſioners; with him was enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged one <hi>George Phillips</hi> a Serjant in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels Company of the White Regiment, <hi>Thomas Tongue</hi> a diſtiller of Strong Waters, <hi>Francis Stubbs</hi> a Cheeſe-monger, <hi>James Hide</hi> Gunner, <hi>John Selly</hi> Compaſs-maker, and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel Gibbs</hi> Felt-maker. Their Plot was againſt the Sacred Life of the King, the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> General <hi>Monk,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> and generally the Biſhops, the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Gentry and Commonalty, that were not of their opinion, and aſſiſted them not: Their Commander in Chief was to be <hi>Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> and one Colonel <hi>Danvers,</hi> Maſter <hi>Nye,</hi> Maſter <hi>Lockyer,</hi> Lievtenant <hi>Strange</hi>; the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, <hi>Spencer</hi> and <hi>Taverner</hi> were favourable to the Deſign; Their Councils was carried on by Six, who never ſat twice in a Place, nor could be known to any two; <hi>Deal Caſtle</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and <hi>Windſor</hi> was promiſed to be theirs. This Treaſonable Plot was by one <hi>Hill</hi> (who was endeavoured to be drawn into
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51922:93"/>
it by Captain <hi>Baker</hi>) diſcovered to Sir <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> with the Names of the Conſpirators, who were for the ſame apprehended, and <hi>December</hi> 11. 1662. brought to a Tryal, where being by plain Evidence convicted, they were condemned, and <hi>December</hi> 22. Four of them, (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Phillips, Tongue, Gibbs</hi> and <hi>Stubbs</hi> were Executed, and their Heads ſet upon ſeveral Poles, two on each <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> the neareſt place to the <hi>Tower.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>February</hi> the 20. one <hi>Gibbs,</hi> Brother of the aforeſaid <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> who fled, and was re-taken, was ſent to the Seſſions Houſe in the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> and with the ſaid Captain <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> condemned for the former Treaſon, and both of them Executed at <hi>Tyburn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe might be added the Intended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> and ſome other of the Northern Counties, by ſome deſparate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks, for which divers of them were Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted at <hi>York,</hi> and elſe-where; but we ſhall wave our Diſcourſe of them, and conclude with the Execution of ſome Notorious <hi>Scotch</hi> Traytors.</p>
            <p>And firſt of the Marqueſs of <hi>Argyle,</hi> one who was a deſparate Enemy to the Old King all along, a chief Contriver and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter of that Deſtructive Covenant, the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51922:93"/>
               <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> of that Nation, which the <hi>Scots</hi> believed (as the <hi>Trojans</hi> did by their Image of <hi>Pallas</hi>) came from Heaven; a greater Sider with <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and one who had carried himſelf very undutifully and irreverently to his Majeſty, at what time he was amongſt them in <hi>Scotland</hi>; yet notwithſtanding all theſe inſolencies, upon the Kings Reſtitution with great confidence he came up to <hi>London,</hi> hoping to have obtained his pardon for all thoſe baſe Treaſons he had ſo covertly Acted in that Kingdome, and that his Majeſty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Gracious Inclination would have paſt by all his Offences; But ſuch was the general hatred and deteſtation of that People towards him, eſpecially of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that by the Kings Order he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and from thence, not long after in order to his Tryal conveyed to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he was brought to account for all his abominable Treaſons, and notwithſtanding he cunningly defended himſelf, and pleaded the Kings Pardon, and the Treaties in 1650. and 1651. yet was there ſuch Crimes of a later date, (beſides the never to be forgotten Treachery of Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt to the <hi>Engliſh</hi>) as juſtly condemned him, whereupon <hi>June</hi> the

1. 1661. He was accordingly Beheaded with the Maiden, for ſo is the Axe called in <hi>Scotland</hi>; At his death he very much juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Covenant, that <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Witch, which conſiſted of 666 words, the number of the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and which coſt almoſt as many Thouſand Mens lives as there were words contained in the ſame.</p>
            <p>Neer unto the ſame time, Maſter <hi>James Guthery,</hi> a prime Remonſtrator, and a violent Adverſary to the King in his Lievtenant the Marqueſs of <hi>Montross,</hi> together with one Captain <hi>Giffan</hi> a Runnegado to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> were by Sentence and Decree of Parliament han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at <hi>Edenburgh</hi>; ſo far (to uſe the words of an Elegant Authour writing upon theſe Affairs) the Laws, and a ſuffering ſenſe of the Miſeries and Reproaches that Nation lay under by theſe Men, and their Partiſans Guilt, did now prevail againſt the <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> of the Kirk, which had Enſlaved and Enchanted the whole Maſſe of that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>We ſhall conclude all with the Lord <hi>Warreston,</hi> a wicked Knave, a Committee of Safety Man, notoriouſly Infamous for his Treaſon in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and a fugitive there; who being Proclaimed a Rebel and Traytor,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51922:94"/>
was taken and ſecured in <hi>France,</hi> and ſent over hither, where having remained ſome time in the <hi>Tower,</hi> he was conveyed into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and there Tryed, Condemned, and Executed according to Law, 1662.</p>
