            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>The</hi> CASE <hi>between a</hi> FATHER <hi>and his</hi> CHILDREN. <hi>Humbly repreſented to the Honourable</hi> LORD MAYOR <hi>and Court of</hi> ALDERMEN.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Since Gods providence hath ſo highly advanc'd you to that Honour and Dignity, as to be in ſome meaſure a Father to this City, that hath been famous for Loyalty, Juſtice, and Equity; and I knowing your Lordſhip to be ſo good, that you hate to do any thing that ſhould leſſen the Grandeur, or to incourage Rebellion or Diſobedience, and I queſtion not but your Brethren the Aldermen are of the ſame mind: Therefore I thought I could not apply my ſelf to any fitter perſons than your Worſhips, neither can I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that any ſhould conſider my Caſe ſo well as your Honour. I beſeech your Lordſhip to pardon me in giving you this trouble, it is the great love I bear to Unity, and the conſideration that I am a Mother of Children, and in ſome part am ſenſible of the Excellency of Obedience, and how it prevails over the hearts of Parents; ſo that thereby they are inſtrumental to obtain the Bleſſing of God Spiritual and Temperal; but what a lamentable caſe it is when Children are diſobedient and rebellious, it provokes the Wrath of God and Man, and makes them miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this World and the World to come, without Repentance. The ſerious conſideration of this, hath cauſed me to preſent to your Lordſhip, and the Aldermen your Brethren, a Caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Father and his Children.</p>
            <p>There is a certain Friend of mine that lives near me, whoſe Vertue and Patience is known to all the Neighbourhood, and that he is the moſt Indulgent Father, and loveth his Children extraordinary, therefore he thought himſelf happy and did not queſtion their Aſſiſtance, when he ſtood in need thereof, but the Children taking no notice of his neceſſity, he was compelled to crave their Aſſiſtance; but the Children finding their Father in neceſſity, they dealt ſubtilly, and ſaid amongſt themſelves, We will deal by him as we pleaſe, and he ſhall condeſcend to our Propoſals, for who knows whether our Father hath walkt according to the Rules of Law or no, and if not, we will get advantage thereby, and ſo we will not allow any Succour to our Father, nay not ſo much as reſpect them that love him, neither ſhall they Succour him, but we'll hate them with a mortal hatred that ſhall either lend him, or give him any thing; nay moreover, our Father ſhall not ſell any thing, for we will count them our great Enemies that ſhall buy any thing; ſo we are reſolved to humble our Father, to comply with our deſires, or to make him miſerable, in not Miniſtring to his neceſſities: But God, that over-rules all things, took pity of this good Father, and indued him with Patience to bear it, and the Lord helped him, and when his Children were a little peaceable and quier, he thought with himſelf, I will try whether my Children walks by the Law or no; if they do, certainly I ſhall have Juſtice done me, for the Law of God and Man is on my ſide; for they both exhort to Love and Obedience: But when the Father propos'd this Queſtion, though it was with mildneſs and ſweetneſs, they were ſo far from acknowledging their Faults, that they would make themſelves as though they had received an injury to be queſtioned, and therefore they would Right themſelves by the Law; and though they would not aſſiſt their Father in his neceſſity, yet they could find Kaſh to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Lawyers. But I'll appeal to your Lordſhip and your Brethren, Whether theſe Children are not unkind and ungrateful? Should not they rather humble themſelves, and acknowledge their Faults, and amend it for the time to come? For they may very well think that their Father is Wiſe, and would not take any notice of any thing, before he had good ground. Therefore I beſeech you for the Lords ſake, to favour me ſo much, as not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe my poor weak Endeavours, who longs for a Unity between the Father and his Children, but cannot be ſo happy without your Lordſhip and the Aldermen your Brethrens Aſſiſtance; and through you and by you I do not queſtion but to obtain it. Therefore I beſeech you for the Lords ſake, to uſe all pious Endeavours to make up this Breach and to decide this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, for Bleſſed are the Peace-makers; undoubtedly my Lord, thrice Bleſſed will you be to be Inſtrumental in this Peace, for this end Chriſt took Humanity upon him, to make Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation between God and Man, ſo that they might be able to cry, <hi>Abba Father.</hi> Theſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren hath been naturally Good, but only too much inclin'd to hearken to the Whiſperings of Satan and his Inſtuments, to incenſe them againſt their Father, as he did in the beginning with our Firſt Parents, to make themſelves miſerable by their diſobedience. So Satan envies theſe their happineſs, and therefore perſwades them to diſobedience; thinking thereby to make them miſerable and wretched: for it is ſeldom known that an unkind Child to a Temporal Father, was ever counted an Obedient Servant to God, if not Obedient then Rebellious. What againſt Heaven? Then Gods Hand will be againſt them, which the Lord of his Mercy prevent, ſhall be always the Prayers of</p>
