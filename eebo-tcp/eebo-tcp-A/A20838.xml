            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Out of all which, he that wil, may ſee, that the loſſes, diſhonours and troubles that have befallen this Land, and indeede our religion and brethren alſo in the Palatinate, Germanie, France and other parts, have cheifely ſprunge from theſe two fountains. 1.

A vaine policie of ſuppreſſing ſuch preachers, writers and Parliament men, as ſought to diſcover the miſcheife of trecherie, and obtaine effectuall reformation. In the later (if not in both) the power and flatterie of the Biſhops were principall helpes, theire ſeeming holy habit, reverence, and authority, countenanced the projects of the Duke and his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, while for preferment, they ſtuck faſt to him and them in court and Parliament: and theire power and hierarchie ſerved to terrifie, ſuppreſſe and ſtop the mouthes of ſuch miniſters &amp; wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who otherwiſe might by theire ſermons and bookes have diſcovered the homebred enemies, and obtained releife for the freinds of our religion, which is the ſervice Chriſt gets by Lord Biſhops and theire hierarchie; who hereby ſhewed, that they will ſooner let religion, Prince, State and all go downe, then theire owne uſurped dignities and hopes of further preferment, for theſe and other courtiers and Dukaniſts, that have ſtil pretended the Kings power and prerogative, have not ſtrengthened, but rather weakened and debaſed the ſame. 1. By thoſe fruitles expeditions that they cauſed abroade; which were ſo forecaſted that the Sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Souldiers, neither comming to good ſervice nor theire pay, ſhould refuſe to ſerve the King any more, or to be governed by his officers, but be readier to ſpoile theire countrey when they returned. 2.

And while they got his majeſtie to ſuffer divers ambitious divines for advancement, to broach anew, the doctrines of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and to erect popiſh ſuperſtition, to the treading under foote as wel of the divine law, as of the Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, have they by al theſe things gotten the King and his lawes to be more reverenced, or leſſe?

And yet God knowes verie few have of late yeares attained or hold any greate offices or honours, but on ſuch termes, or at leaſt by reaſon of ſome participation with them. Witnes thoſe furtheſt from court, and leaſt infected, the Leifte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, Deputie-Leiftenants, Iudges, Iuſtices, Majors, Aldermen and other officers, made to further or exact, and wringe from the people, benevolences and loanes, and to ſtraine for them or impriſon ſuch as ſtood out, or make them ſerve as Souldiers, or lodge and maintain ſuch unruly and unpaide Souldiers, as were billited, in theire townes and villages, for no other ſervice then to puniſh them: things ſet a foote to hinder the calling of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, breede diviſions, if not rebellions, make the Land weary of warres for defence of religion; and ſo to ſave the trecherie of the Duke and his confederates from comming to triall: who in the meane while have ever found the commons new greivances to put the old accuſations and proofes out of theire mindes. Many greate complaints have beene made againſt ſuch men: God graunt the King, may give them an effectuall hearing in a free parliament, leaſt otherwiſe men fearing to be impriſoned &amp; cruſhed, as others have beene, ſhould not ſpeake what they know; and ſo trecherie ſhould ſtill prevaile, and hinder the King of the happines following the due execution of juſtice: <hi>for the throne is eſtabliſhed by iustice.</hi>
