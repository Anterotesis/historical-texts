            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ELLEGY ON LODOWICK MUGGLETON: Who Lies Bury'd Alive in the Colledge of <hi>Newgate,</hi> Expecting dayly his Happy RESURRECTION.</head>
            <l>ALL thoſe that uſe with Watry Eyes</l>
            <l>To Weep at Mournful Eligies;</l>
            <l>For loſs of Neighbour, or of Friend,</l>
            <l>Or loſs of Fop, that us'd to ſpend</l>
            <l>His Time, and Money, e'ry day</l>
            <l>In Tavern, and there ever pay</l>
            <l>The Total Summ who e're is by;</l>
            <l>For loſs of ſuch you ought to cry:</l>
            <l>My Muſe does now invite your Ear,</l>
            <l>A Pleaſant Elegy to hear:</l>
            <l>For ſo I'le term it, if that you</l>
            <l>In Elegies e're Pleaſure knew:</l>
            <l>A Prophet Falſe, and Monſter great,</l>
            <l>Who often did Damnation threat,</l>
            <l>To thoſe that never would him Treat;</l>
            <l>Lies Bury'd now Alive, not Dead,</l>
            <l>Miſtake me not; what I have ſaid</l>
            <l>Is very true: In <hi>Newgate</hi> now</l>
            <l>He is Entom'd, and knows not how</l>
            <l>To get away, ſo ſtrong's the Stone,</l>
            <l>Which makes him daily ſigh and groan;</l>
            <l>But all in vain, ſuch is his fate,</l>
            <l>He now may curſe his Doom too late;</l>
            <l>But leaſt you ſhould the Poet blame,</l>
            <l>Becauſe he has not told his Name,</l>
            <l>He ſays 'tis <hi>Muggleton,</hi> the ſame</l>
            <l>Who whilſt in living liberty</l>
            <l>Arriv'd to ſuch Damn'd Blaſphemy</l>
            <l>That all Man-kind he did out-vye;</l>
            <l>He had ſuch Power he did Proteſt,</l>
            <l>And ſpoke in Earneſt, not in Jeſt;</l>
            <l>He many Hundred men had bleſt;</l>
            <l>If all were true which he has ſaid,</l>
            <l>He would have made us all affraid;</l>
            <l>If thoſe he Curs'd, and thoſe he Damn'd,</l>
            <l>Could not through Faith his Doom withſtand;</l>
            <l>'Twere a hard caſe I muſt confeſs,</l>
            <l>But yet again this Man could Bleſs</l>
            <l>The very ſame he Curs'd before,</l>
            <l>If that they had but Guinnies ſtore;</l>
            <l>Or Houſes, or would give a Treat</l>
            <l>With Wine, and Capons, or ſuch Meat</l>
            <l>For thoſe he'd bleſs, and bleſs agen;</l>
            <l>And to his Bleſſings ſay; <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But if they no ſuch comforts had,</l>
            <l>He us'd to ſay their Caſe was bad;</l>
            <l>And Damne 'em ſtraight ſuch was his power,</l>
            <l>He'd Bleſs and Curſe 'em in an Hour;</l>
            <l>He ſaid that he a Prophet was,</l>
            <l>And did all other Power Surpaſs:</l>
            <l>And with a Countenance of Braſs</l>
            <l>He ſaid that thoſe he Damn'd were Damn'd,</l>
            <l>And nothing could that Fate withſtand;</l>
            <l>Nor yet Reverſe his Curſed Doom,</l>
            <l>For Bleſſings he had left no room;</l>
            <l>This he did Witneſs to his Tomb.</l>
            <l>The Fooliſh Siſters all Complain;</l>
            <l>Crying, <hi>Lodowick,</hi> ariſe again;</l>
            <l>Ariſe, ariſe, out of thy Tomb</l>
            <l>Dear <hi>Muggleton</hi> we pray thee come:</l>
            <l>We want thy Bleſſings, come away,</l>
            <l>Our Prophet's gone, we go aſtray:</l>
            <l>We here have brought a Key of Gold,</l>
            <l>Which will releaſe thee from thy hold,</l>
            <l>Come forth with Courage Stout and bold.</l>
            <l>'Twill ope the Door without all doubt,</l>
            <l>Come <hi>Lodowick</hi> thou muſt come out:</l>
            <l>Methinks I hear the Boys Complain,</l>
            <l>And wiſh they had him once again;</l>
            <l>They'd fit him better then before,</l>
            <l>For now they have got Eggs good ſtore;</l>
            <l>In <hi>Smithfield</hi> they did want ſupply,</l>
            <l>When he ſtood their I'th Pillory;</l>
            <l>All things conſider'd by the wiſe,</l>
            <l>Our <hi>Muggleton</hi> again muſt riſe:</l>
            <l>VVe from our Prophet cannot part,</l>
            <l>To riſe again he has an Art,</l>
            <l>Or elſe he is not worth a Fart;</l>
