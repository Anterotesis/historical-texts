         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

either from manifeſt reaſon alluring

            <p>Of theſe, ſome haue endeauored to effect this their purpoſe,
by concluſion and conſequence, drawne from the proportion

haue deſerued great commendation of their owne ages, and

<hi>Francis Drake</hi> atcheiued, in firſt turning vp a furrow about

hereof let poſterity iudge.</p>
            <p>It ſhall, for the preſent, be deemed a ſufficient diſcharge of duty,
to regiſter the true and whole hiſtory of that his voyage, with

            <p>As ſoone as we were out of ſight of land, our generall gaue
vs occaſion to coniecture in part, whither he intended, both by

the directing of his courſe, and appointing the <hi>Randeuous</hi> (if

And ſo ſailing with fauorable windes, the firſt land that
wee had ſight of, was <hi>Cape Cantine</hi> in <hi>Barbarie December 25.
Chriſtmas</hi> day in the morning.<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Dec. </seg>25</label> The ſhoare is faire white ſand,
and the inland contrie very high and mountainous, it lieth in
32. deg. 30. mi. north latitude, and ſo coaſting from hence
ſouthward, about 18. leagues, we arriued the ſame day at
<hi>Mogadore</hi> the Iland before named.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Mogadore,</hi> lies vnder the dominion of the king of <hi>Feſſe</hi> in
31. deg. 40. mi. about a mile off from the ſhoare, by this meanes
making a good harbor betweene the land and it. It is vninhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
of about a league in circuit, not very high land, all ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growne
with a kinde of ſhrub breſt high, not much vnlike our
priuet, verie full of Doues and therefore much frequented of
Goſhaukes, and ſuch like birds of prey, beſides diuers ſorts of
ſea-foule very plentie. At the ſouth ſide of this Iland are three
hollow rocks, vnder which are great ſtore of very wholeſome
but very vglie fiſh to looke to. Lying here about a mile from
the maine, a boate was ſent to ſound the harbor, and finding it
ſafe, and in the very entrance on the north ſide about 5. or 6.
fathome water (but at the ſouther ſide it is very dangerous) we
brought in our whole fleet <hi>December</hi> 27. and continued there
till the laſt day of the ſame moneth, imploying our leaſure, the
meane while,<label type="milestone">

               </label> in ſetting vp a pinnace, one of the 4. brought from
home in peices with vs. Our abode here was ſoone perceiued by
the inhabitants of the contrie, who comming to the ſhoare, by
ſignes and cries made ſhewe, that they deſired to be fetched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
to whom our generall ſent a boate, into which 2. of the
chiefeſt of the <hi>Moores</hi> were preſently receiued, and one man
of ours, in exchange, left a land, as a pledge for their returne.</p>
            <p>They that came aboard were right courteouſly entertained,
with a daintie banquet, and ſuch gifts as they ſeemed to be moſt
glad of, that they might thereby vnderſtand, that this fleete
came in peace and friendſhip, offering to traffique with them,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:5654:7"/>
for ſuch commodities as their contrie yeelded, to their owne
content. This offer they ſeemed moſt gladly to accept, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
the next day, to reſort againe, with ſuch things as they
had to exchange for ours. It is a law amongſt them to drinke no
wine, notwithſtanding by ſtealth it pleaſeth them well to haue
it abundantly, as here was experience. At their returne aſhoare,
they quietly reſtored the pledge which they had ſtayed, and the
next day, at the houre appointed, returning againe, brought
with them Camells, in ſhewe loaden with wares to be exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
for our commodities, and calling for a boate in haſte, had
one ſent them, according to order, which our generall (being at
this preſent abſent) had giuen before his departure to the
Iland.</p>
            <p>Our boate comming to the place of landing (which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the rocks) one of our men called <hi>Iohn Fry,</hi> miſtruſting no
danger, nor fearing any harme pretended by them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
intending to become a pledge, according to the order vſed
the day before, readilie ſtept out of the boate and ranne a land,
which oportunitie (being that which the <hi>Moores</hi> did looke for)
they tooke the aduantage of, and not onely they which were in
ſight, layed hands on him to carrie him away with them, but a
number more, which lay ſecretly hidden, did forth with breake
forth from behinde the rocks, whither they had conueyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
(as it ſeemeth the night before) forcing our men to leaue
the reſcuing of him that was taken as captiue, and with ſpeed to
ſhift for themſelues.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of this violence, was a deſire which the king of
<hi>Feſſe</hi> had, to vnderſtand what this fleet was, whether any fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner
of the kings of <hi>Portugall</hi> or no, and what newes of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
the fleet might giue him. And therefore after that he was
brought to the kings preſence, and had reported that they were
Engliſhmen, bound for the ſtraights, vnder the conduct of
generall <hi>Drake,</hi> he was ſent back againe with a preſent to his
Captaine and offer of great curteſie and freindſhip, if he would
vſe his contry But in this meane time, the generall being grieued
with this ſhew of iniurie, and intending, if he might, to recouer
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:5654:8"/>
or redeeme his man, his pinnace being ready, landed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and marched ſomewhat into the countrie, without any
reſiſtance made againſt him: neither would the <hi>Moores,</hi> by any
meanes come nigh our men, to deale with them any way;
wherefore hauing made prouiſion of wood, as alſo viſited an old
fort, built ſometime by the king of <hi>Portugall,</hi> but now ruined by
the king of <hi>Feſſe,</hi> we departed <hi>December</hi> 31.<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Dec. </seg>31</label> towards <hi>Cape
Blanck,</hi> in ſuch ſort, that when <hi>Fry</hi> returned, he found to his
great griefe, that the fleet was gone: but yet, by the kings fauor,
he was ſent home into <hi>England</hi> not long after, in an Engliſh
Merchants ſhip.</p>
            <p>Shortly after our putting forth of this harbour, we were met
with contrary windes and foule weather, which continued till

            </p>
            <p>This cape lieth in 20. deg. 30. min. ſhewing it ſelfe vpright
like the corner of a wall, to them that come towards it from the
North, hauing, betweene it and cape <hi>Barbas,</hi> lowe, ſandy, and
very white land all the way. Here we obſerued the ſouth <hi>Guards,</hi>
called the <hi>Croſiers</hi> 9. deg. 30. min. aboue the horizon. Within
the cape, we tooke one ſpaniſh ſhip more riding at anchor (all
her men being fled aſhoare in the boate ſaue two) which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
the reſt we had formerly taken, we caried into the harbor, 3.
leagues within the cape.</p>
            <p>Here our generall determined, for certaine dayes to make
his abode, both for that the place afforded plenty of freſh vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualls,
for the preſent refreſhing of our men, and for their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſupply at ſea (by reaſon of the infinite ſtore of diuers ſorts of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:5654:8"/>
good fiſh, which are there eaſie to be taken, euen within the
harbor, the like whereof, is hardly to be found againe, in any
part of the world) as alſo, becauſe it ſerued very fitly, for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching
of ſome other buſineſſes that we had. During the time
of our abode in this place, our generall being aſhoare was viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by certaine of the people of the country, who brought
downe with them a woman a <hi>Moore</hi> (with her little babe han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
vpon her dry dugge, hauing ſcarce life in herſelfe, much
leſſe milke to nouriſh her child) to be ſould as a horſe, or a cow
and calfe by her ſide, in which ſort of merchandiſe our generall
would not deale. But they had alſo Amber-greece, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
gummes of ſome eſtimation, which they brought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
with our men for water (whereof they haue great want)
ſo that comming with their <hi>Allforges</hi> (they are leathern bags
holding liquor) to buy water, they cared not at what price they
bought it, ſo they might haue to quench their thirſt. A very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
iudgement of God vpon that coaſt! The circumſtances
whereof conſidered, our generall would receiue nothing of
them for water, but freely gaue it them that came to him, yea
and fed them alſo ordinarily with our victualls, in eating where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
their manner was not onely vnciuill, and vnſightly to vs, but
euen inhumane and loathſome in it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>And hauing waſhed and trimd our ſhips, and diſcharged all
our ſpaniſh priſes, excepting one <hi>Caunter</hi> (for which we gaue to
the owner one of our owne ſhips viz. the Chriſtopher) and one
caruell formerly bound to Saint <hi>Iago,</hi> which we cauſed to acom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
vs hither, where ſhee alſo was diſcharged: <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ian. </seg>22</label> after 6. dayes
abode here, we departed, directing our courſe for the Ilands of
cape <hi>Verde,</hi> where (if any where) we were of neceſſity to ſtore
our fleet with freſh water, for a long time, for that our generall
intended from thence to runne a long courſe (euen to the coaſt
of <hi>Braſill</hi>) without touch of land. And now, hauing the winde
conſtant at <hi>North Eaſt &amp; East North Eaſt,</hi> which is vſuall about
thoſe parts, becauſe it bloweth almoſt continually from the
ſhoare. <hi>Ianuary</hi> the 27. we coaſted <hi>Bonaviſta,</hi> and the next day
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:5654:9"/>
after, we came to anchor vnder the Weſter part (towards Saint

               <label type="milestone">

that the North-weſt part ſtretcheth out into the ſea, the

king of Portugall.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ian. </seg>29</label> Here landing, in hope of traffique with the inhabitants for
water, we found a Towne, not farre from the waters ſide, of a
great number of deſolate and ruinous houſes, with a poore na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Chappell or Oratory, ſuch as ſmall coſt and charge might
ſerue and ſuffice, being to ſmall purpoſe, and as it ſeemeth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to make a ſhew, and that a falſe ſhew, contrary to the nature
of a ſcarcrow, which feareth birds from comming nigh; this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſeth
ſuch as paſſe by to hale in, and looke for commodity,
which is not at all to be found there; though in the inner parts
of the Iland it be in great abundance.</p>
            <p>For when wee found the ſprings and wells which had beene
there (as appeared) ſtopped vp againe, and no other water, to
purpoſe, to bee had to ſerue our need, we marched vp to ſeeke
ſome more conuenient place to ſupply our want, or at leaſt to
ſee whether the people would be dealt withal, to helpe vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
In this trauelling, we found the ſoile to be very fruitfull, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
euery where plenty of figgetrees, with fruite vpon moſt of
them. But in the vallies and low ground, where little low cotta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
were built, were pleaſant vineyards planted, bearing then,
ripe and moſt pleaſant grapes. There were alſo tall trees, without
any branch till the top, which bare the <hi>Coco nuts.</hi> There were
alſo great ſtore of certaine lower trees, with long and broad
leaues, bearing the fruit which they call <hi>Plantanes,</hi> in cluſters to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
like puddings, a moſt dainty and wholeſome fruit. All
of theſe trees were euen laden with fruit, ſome ready to be eaten,
others comming forward, others ouer-ripe. Neither can this
ſeeme ſtrange, though about the middeſt of Winter with vs, for
that the Sunne doth neuer withdraw himſelfe farther off from
them, but that with his liuely heate he quickeneth and ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the power of the ſoyle and plant; neither euer haue they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:5654:9"/>
any ſuch froſt and cold, as thereby to looſe their greene hew and
appearance.</p>
            <p>We found very good water in diuerſe places, but ſo farre off
from the roade, that wee could not with any reaſonable paines
enioy it. The people would by no meanes be induced to haue
any conference with vs, but keeping in the moſt ſweet and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
vallies among the hils, where their townes and places of
dwelling were, gaue vs leaue without interruption to take our
pleaſure in ſuruewing the Iland, as they had ſome reaſon, not to
endanger themſelues, where they ſaw they could reape nothing
ſooner then damage and ſhame, if they ſhould haue offered vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to them which came in peace to do them no wrong at all.</p>
            <p>This Iland yeeldeth other great commodities, as wonderfull
heards of goats, infinite ſtore of wilde hens, and ſalt without la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
(onely the gathering it together excepted) which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
in a maruellous quantitie is increaſed vpon the ſands by
the flowing of the ſea, and the heate of the Sunne kerning the

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ian. </seg>31</label> the next day wee paſſed by the
Iland of Saint <hi>Iago,</hi> ten leagues Weſt of <hi>Maio</hi> in the ſame lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
inhabited by the Portugals and Moores together. The
cauſe whereof is ſaid to haue beene in the Portugals themſelues,
who (continuing long time Lords within themſelues, in the
ſaid Iland) vſed that extreame and vnreaſonable crueltie ouer
their ſlaues, that (their bondage being intollerable) they were
forced to ſeeke ſome meanes to helpe themſelues, and to lighten
that ſo heauy a burden; and thereupon choſe to flie into the
moſt mountany parts of the Iland: and at laſt, by continuall
eſcapes, increaſing to a great number, and growing to a ſet
ſtrength, do now liue, with that terror to their oppreſſors, that
they now endure no leſſe bondage in mind then the <hi>Forcatos</hi> did
before in body: beſides the dammage that they daily ſuffer at
their hands in their goods and cattell, together with the abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:5654:10"/>
of their liberties in the vſe of diuerſe parts of the fruitfull
ſoile of the ſaid Iland: which is very large, maruellous fruitfull (a
refuge for all ſuch ſhips as are bound towards Braſill, Ginny, the
Eaſt Indies, Binny, Calecut. &amp;c.) and a place of rare force, if it
were not for the cauſe afore-recited, which hath much abated
the pride, and cooled the courage of that people, who (vnder
pretence of traffique and friendſhip) at firſt making an entrance
ceaſed not, practiſing vpon the poore Ilanders (the ancient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of the firſt planters thereof, as it may ſeeme from the
coaſt of Guinea) vntil they had excluded them from all gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and liberty, yea almoſt life.</p>
            <p>On the South-weſt of this Iland, we tooke a Portugall laden
the beſt part with wine, and much good cloth, both linnen and
woollen, beſides other neceſſaries, bound for Braſill, with many
gentlemen and Marchants in her.</p>
            <p>As we paſſed by with our fleet, in ſight of 3. of their townes,
they ſeemed very ioyfull that wee touched not with their coaſt;
and ſeeing vs depart peaceably, in honour of our fleet and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
or rather to ſignifie that they were prouided for an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault,
ſhot off two great peeces into the ſea, which were anſwered
by one giuen them againe from vs.</p>
            <p>South weſt from Saint <hi>Iago</hi> in 14. deg. 30. min. about twelue
leagues diſtant, yet, by reaſon of the height ſeeming not aboue
three leagues lyeth another Iland, called of the Portugals <hi>Fogo,</hi>
viz. the burning Iland, or fierie fornace, in which riſeth a ſteepe
vpright hill, by coniecture at leaſt ſix leagues, or eighteene Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
miles from the vpper part of the water: within the bowels
whereof, is a conſuming fire, maintained by ſulphury matter,
ſeeming to be of a maruellous depth, and alſo very wide. The
fire ſheweth it ſelfe but foure times in an houre, at which times
it breaketh our with ſuch violence and force, and in ſuch maine
abundance, that beſides that it giueth light like the Moone a
great way off, it ſeemeth, that it would not ſtay till it touch the
heauens themſelues. Herein are ingendred great ſtore of pumice
ſtones, which being in the vehement heate of the fire caried vp
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:5654:10"/>
without the mouth of that fiery body, fall downe, with other
groſſe and ſlimy matter vpon the hill, to the continuall increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the ſame. And many times theſe ſtones falling downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſea are taken vp and vſed, as we our ſelues had experience
by ſight of them ſwimming on the water. The reſt of the Iland
is fruitfull notwithſtanding, and is inhabited by Portugals, who
liue very commodiouſly therein, as in the other Ilands there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about.</p>
            <p>Vpon the South ſide, about two leagues off this Iland of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
lyeth a moſt ſweet and pleaſant Iland, the trees thereof are
alwaies greene and faire to looke on, the ſoile almoſt full ſet with
trees, in reſpect wherof its named the Braue Iland, being a ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe
of many fruits and commodities, as figges alwayes ripe,
cocos, plantons, orenges, limons, cotton, &amp;c. from the bancks
into the ſea do runne in many places the ſiluer ſtreames of ſweet
and wholſome water, which with boats or pinnaces may eaſily
be taken in. But there is no conuenient place or roade for ſhips,
neither any anchoring at all. For after long triall, and often ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
of leades, there could no ground be had at any hand, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was it euer knowne (as is reported) that any line would
fetch ground in any place about that Iland. So that the top of
<hi>Fogo</hi> burneth not ſo high in the aire, but the roote of <hi>Braua</hi> (ſo
is the Iland called) is buried and quenched as low in the ſeas.</p>
            <p>The onely inhabitant of this Iland is an Heremit, as we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
for we found no other houſes but one, built as it ſeemed
for ſuch a purpoſe; and he was ſo delighted in his ſolitarie liuing,
that he would by no meanes abide our comming, but fled, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
behind him the relicks of his falſe worſhip; to wit, a croſſe,
with a crucifix, an altar with his ſuperaltar, and certaine other
idols of wood of rude workemanſhip.</p>
            <p>Here we diſmiſſed the Portugals taken neere Saint <hi>Iago,</hi> and

            <p>Hauing thus viſited, as is declared, the Ilands of cape <hi>Verde,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:5654:11"/>
and prouided freſh water as we could, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Feb. </seg>2</label> the ſecond of <hi>Febr.</hi> we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
thence, directing our courſe towards the ſtraights, ſo to
paſſe into the South ſea; in which courſe wee ſayled 63. dayes
without ſight of land (paſſing the line equinoctiall <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Feb. </seg>17</label> the 17. day

            </p>
            <p>During which long paſſage on the vaſt gulph, where nothing
but ſea beneath vs and aire aboue vs was to be ſeene, as our eies
did behold the wonderfull workes of God in his creatures, which
he hath made innumerable both ſmall and great beaſts, in the
great and wide ſeas: ſo did our mouthes taſte, and our natures
feed on, the goodneſſe thereof in ſuch fulneſſe at all times, and
in euery place, as if he had commanded and enioyned the moſt
profitable and glorious works of his hands to waite vpon vs, not
alone for the reliefe of our neceſſities, but alſo to giue vs delight
in the contemplation of his excellence, in beholding the variety
and order of his prouidence, with a particular taſt of his fatherly
care ouer vs all the while.</p>
            <p>The truth is, wee often met with aduerſe winds, vn welcome
ſtormes, and to vs (at that time) leſſe welcome calmes, and being
as it were in the boſome of the burning zone, we felt the effects
of ſultring heat, not without the affrights of flaſhing lightnings,
and terrifyings of often claps of thunder; yet ſtil with the admix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of many comforts. For this we could not but take notice of,
that whereas we were but badly furniſhed (our caſe conſidered)
of freſh water (hauing neuer at all watred (to any purpoſe, or that
we could ſay wee were much the better for it) from our firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth out of England till this time, nor meeting with any
place where we might conueniently water, till our comming to
the riuer of Plate, long after) continually, after once we were
come within foure degrees of the line on this ſide, viz. after <hi>Feb.</hi>
10. and till we were paſt the line as many degrees towards the
South, viz. till <hi>Feb.</hi> 27. there was no one day went ouer vs but
we receiued ſome raine, whereby our want of water was much
ſupplyed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:5654:11"/>
This alſo was obſeruable, that of our whole fleet, being now
6. in number, notwithſtanding the vncouthnes of the way, and
what euer other difficulties, by weather or otherwiſe wee met
withall, not any one, in all this ſpace, loſt company of the reſt;
except onely our Portugall priſe for one day, who <hi>March</hi> 28.
was ſeuered from vs, but the day following <hi>March</hi> 29. ſhee
found vs againe, to both here owne, and our no little comfort:
ſhee had in her 28. of our men, and the beſt part of all our proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

ſorrow in the whole companie, neither could ſhee then haue
been finally loſt, without the ouerthrow of the whole voyage.</p>
            <p>Among the many ſtrange creatures which we ſawe, we tooke
heedfull notice of one, as ſtrange as any; to wit, the flying fiſh,
a fiſh of the bignes and proportion, of a reaſonable or middle
ſort of Pilchards: hee hath finnes, of the length of his whole
body, from the bulk to the top of the taile, bearing the forme,
and ſupplying the like vſe to him, that wings doe to other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
By the helpe of theſe finnes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is chaſed of the <hi>Bonito,</hi>
or great mackrel (whom the <hi>Aurata</hi> or dolphin likewiſe purſueth)
and hath not ſtrength to eſcape by ſwimming any longer, hee
lifteth vp himſelfe aboue the water, and flieth a pretty height,
ſometimes lighting into boates or barkes as they ſaile along:
The quills of their wings are ſo proportionable, and finelie ſet
together, with a moſt thinne and dainty filme, that they might
ſeeme to ſerue, for a much longer and higher flight, but the drie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of them is ſuch, after ſome 10. or 12. ſtrokes, that hee muſt
needs into the water againe to moiſten them, which elſe would
grow ſtiffe and vnfit for motion. The inreaſe of this little and
wonderfull creature is in manner infinite, the fry whereof lieth
vpon the vpper part of the waters, in the heate of the Sun, as
duſt vpon the face of the earth, which being in bigneſſe of a
wheat ſtraw, and length an inch more or leſſe, do continually
exerciſe themſelues in both their faculties of nature: wherein,
if the Lord had not made them expert indeed, their generation
could not haue continued, being ſo deſired a prey to ſo many,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:5654:12"/>
which greedily hunt after them, forcing them to eſcape in the
ayre by flight, when they cannot in the waters liue in ſafety.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1578"/>
Neither are they allwayes free, or without danger, in their fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but as they eſcape one euill, by refuſing the waters ſo they
ſometimes, fall into as great a miſchiefe, by mounting vp into
the ayre, at that, by meanes of a great and rauening foule, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of ſome a <hi>Don</hi> or <hi>Spurkite,</hi> who feeding chiefely, on ſuch
fiſh as he can come by at aduantage, in their ſwimming in the
brim of the waters, or leaping aboue the ſame, preſently ceaſeth
vpon them with great violence, making great havock, eſpecially
amongſt theſe flying fiſhes, though with ſmall profit to himſelfe.</p>
            <p>There is another ſort of fiſh, which likewiſe flieth in the ayre,
named a <hi>Cuttill:</hi> its the ſame, whoſe bones the goldſmithes
commonly vſe, or at leaſt not vnlike that ſort, a multitude of
which, haue at one time, in their flight, fallen into our ſhip, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our men.</p>
            <p>Paſſing thus, in beholding the moſt excellent works of the

Aprill 5. we fell with the coaſt of Braſill, in 31. deg. 30. min.
towards the pole Antartick, where the land is lowe neere the
ſea, but much higher within the countrie; hauing in depth not
aboue 12. fathome, 3. leagues off from the ſhoare: and being
deſcried by the inhabitants, we ſawe great and huge fires,
made by them in ſundry plaes. Which order of making fires,
though it be vniuerſall, as well among Chriſtians as heathens,
yet is it not likely that many doe vſe it to that end, which the
Braſilians doe: to wit, for a ſacrifice to Deuills, whereat they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
intermixe many and diuers ceremonies of coniurations, caſting
vp great heapes of ſand, to this end, that if any ſhips, ſhall go
about to ſtay vpon their coaſts, their miniſtring ſpirits may
make wrack of them, whereof the Portugalls by the loſſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of their ſhips, haue had often experience.</p>
            <p>In the reports of Magellanes voyage, it is ſaid, that this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
pray to no maner of thing, but liue only according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
of nature, which if it were true, there ſhould ſeeme to be a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:5654:12"/>
wonderfull alteration in them, ſince that time, being fallen from
a ſimple and naturall creature, to make Gods of Deuills; But
I am of the minde, that it was with them then, as now it is, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they lacked then the like occaſion, to put it in practiſe which
now they haue: for then, they liued as a free people among
themſelues, but now, are in moſt miſerable bondage and ſlauery,
both in body, goods, wife, and children, and life it ſelf to the
Portugalls, whoſe hard and moſt cruell dealings againſt them,
forceth them to flie, into the more vnfruitful parts of their owne
land, rather there to ſtarue, or at leaſt liue miſerably with liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
then to abide ſuch intollerable bondage, as they lay vpon
them vſing the aforeſaid practiſes with deuills, both for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
againſt their oppreſſors, and alſo for a defence, that they
haue no further entrance into the country. And ſuppoſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that no other had vſed trauell by ſea in ſhips, but their
enemies onely, they therefore vſed the ſame at our comming:
notwitſtanding, our God made their deuiliſh intent of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
For albeit there lacked not (within the ſpace of our falling
with this coaſt) forcible ſtormes and tempeſts, yet did we ſuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aine
no dammage, but onely the ſeperating of our ſhips, out of
ſight for a few dayes. Here our generall would haue gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore,
but we could finde no harbor in many leagues. And
therefore coaſting along the land, towards the ſouth, Aprill 7.<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Apr. </seg>7</label>
we had a violent ſtorme, for the ſpace of 3. houres, With thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
lightning, and raine in great abundance, accompanied
with a vehement ſouth winde, directly againſt vs, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
a ſeperation of the <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> (viz. the Caunter which wee

            <p>After this, we kept on our courſe, ſometime to the ſea ward,
ſometimes toward the ſhoare, but alwayes ſouthward, as neere
as we could: <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Apr. </seg>14</label> till Aprill 14. in the morning, at which time wee
paſſed by cape <hi>Saint Mary,</hi> which lies in 35. deg. neere
the mouth of the riuer of Plate: and running within it about 6.
or 7. leagues along by the maine, we came to anchor in a bay,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:5654:13"/>
vnder another cape which our Generall afterwards called cape
<hi>Ioy</hi>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Apr. </seg>16</label> by reaſon that the ſecond day after our anchoring here, the

vs againe.</p>
            <p>Among other cares which our Generall tooke in this action,
next the maine care of effecting the voyage it ſelfe, theſe were
the principall and chiefly ſubordinate: to keepe our whole fleet
(as neere as poſſible we could) together; to get freſh water which
is of continuall vſe; and to refreſh our men wearied with long
toyles at ſea, as oft as we ſhould find any opportunitie of effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
the ſame. And for theſe cauſes it was determined, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
notice thereof giuen at our departure from the Ilands of
cape <hi>Verde;</hi> that the next Randeuous both for the recollecting
of our nauy (if it ſhould be deſperſed) as alſo for watering, and
the like, ſhould be the riuer of Plate: whither we were all to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
with all the conuenient ſpeed that could be made, and to
ſtay one for another, if it ſhould happen that we could not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue
there all together; and the effect wee found anſwerable to
our expectations, for here our ſeuered ſhip (as hath beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared)
found vs againe, and here we found thoſe other helps al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſo much deſired. The countrey hereabout is of a temperate

the exceeding fruitfulneſſe of the ſoile, its ſtored with plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

            <p>Notwithſtanding that in this firſt bay wee found ſweet and

rocks, not farre from the maine; making a commodious harbor,
eſpecially againſt a Southerly wind: vnder them we anchored,
and rode till the 20. day at night; in which meane ſpace we killed
diuers Seales, or ſea-wolues (as the Spaniard cals them) which
reſorted to theſe rocks in great abundance. They are good meat,
and were an acceptable food to vs for the preſent, and a good
ſupply of our prouiſion for the future.</p>

to haue ſuch often loſſes, and that it was his duty as much
as in him lay, to preuent all inconueniences beſides, that might

ſubiect to many and grieuous ſtormes: And therefore he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued

               <hi>May</hi> 12. wee had ſight of land, in 47. deg. where wee were
forced to come to anchor in ſuch roade as we could find for the

reaſon of a bay diſcouered within the hedland, which ſeemed to
promiſe a good and commodious harbour. But by reaſon of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:5654:14"/>
many rockes lying off from the place, wee durſt not aduenture
with our ſhips into it without good and perfect diſcouery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <p>Our Generall, eſpecially in matters of moment, was neuer
wont to relye onely on other mens care, how truſty or skilfull
ſoeuer they might ſeeme to be; but alwayes contemning danger
and refuſing no toyle, he was wont himſelfe to be one whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
was a ſecond at euery turne, where courage, skill, or induſtry
was to be imployed; neither would hee at this time intruſt the
diſcouery of theſe dangers to anothers paines, but rather to his
owne experience in ſearching out and ſounding of them. <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">May </seg>13</label> A boat
being therefore hoiſed forth, himſelfe with ſome others the next

him ſeeming very pleaſant, ſinging and dancing, after the noiſe
of a rattle which he ſhooke in his hand, expecting earneſtly his

            <p>But there was ſudainly ſo great an alteration in the weather,
into a thick and miſty fogge; together with an extreame ſtorme
and tempeſt, that our generall, being now 3. leagues from his
ſhip, thought it better to returne, then either to land, or make
any other ſtay: and yet the fogg thickened ſo mightily, that the
ſight of the ſhips was bereft them, and if Captaine Thomas (vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the abundance of his loue and ſeruice to his generall) had
not aduentured, with his ſhip to enter that bay, in this perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie,
where good aduiſe would not ſuffer our ſhips to beare in,
while the windes were more tolerable, and the ayre cleerer; we
had ſuſtained ſome great loſſe, or our generall had beene further
endangered, who was now quickly receiued abord his ſhip; out
of which, being within the bay, they let fall an anchor, and rode
there (God be praiſed) in ſafety: but our other ſhips, riding
without, were ſo oppreſſed with the extremitie of the ſtorme,
that they were forced to run off to ſea for their owne ſafegard,
being in good hope onely of the good ſucceſſe of that ſhip,
which was gone in to releiue our generall; before this ſtorme

to goe aſhore, to this end, that he might, by making of
fires, giue ſignes to the diſperſed ſhips, to come together againe
into that roade: whereby at laſt, they were all aſſembled, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
the <hi>Swanne,</hi> loſt long time before, and excepting our
Portugall priſe, called the <hi>Mary;</hi> which waighing in this laſt
ſtorme, the night before, had now loſt company, and was not
found againe in a long time after.</p>
            <p>In this place (the people being remoued vp into the country,
belike for feare of our comming) we found neere vnto the rocks,
in houſes made for that purpoſe, as alſo in diuers other places,
great ſtore of Oſtriches at leaſt to the number of 50. with much
other foule; ſome dried and ſome in drying for their prouiſion,
as it ſeemed, to carrie with them to the place of their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.
The Oſtriches thighs were in bignes equall to reaſonable
legs of murton, They cannot flie at all; but they runne ſo ſwiftly,
and take ſo long ſtrides, that it is not poſſible for a man in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
by any meanes to take them, neither yet to come ſo nigh
them, as to haue any ſhot at them either with bow or peece:
Whereof our men had often proofe on other parts of that coaſt
for all the countrey is full of them; We found there the tooles
or inſtruments which the people vſe in taking them.</p>
            <p>Among other meanes they vſe in betraying theſe Oſtriches,
they haue a great and large plume of feathers, orderly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact
together vpon the end of a ſtaffe; in the forepart bearing the
likeneſſe of the head, necke, and bulke of an Oſtrich; and in the
hinder part, ſpreading it ſelfe out very large, ſufficient (being hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
before him) to hide the moſt part of the body of a man:
With this it ſeemeth they ſtaulke, driuing them into ſome ſtraite
or necke of land cloſe to the ſea ſide; where ſpreading long and
ſtrong nets, with their dogs which they haue in readineſſe at all
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:5654:15"/>
times, they ouerthrow them, and make a common quarry. The
countrey is very pleaſant, and ſeemeth to be a fruitfull ſoyle.</p>
            <p>Being afterwards driuen to fall with this place againe, we had
great acquaintance and familiarity with the people, who reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
greatly in our comming, and in our friendſhip, in that wee
had done them no harme. But becauſe this place was no fit or
conuenient harbor for vs, to do our neceſſary buſines; neither
yet to make prouiſion, of ſuch things as we wanted, as water,
wood, and ſuch like, we departed thence the 15. of May.<label type="milestone">

            </p>
            <p>At our departure hence, we held our courſe South and by

little ſayle, that our fleet might the eaſier gett vp with vs, Which
by reaſon of the contrary windes, were caſt a ſterne of vs.</p>
            <p>In 47. deg. 30. min. we found a bay, which was faire, ſafe,

came further into the ſame bay, where we caſt anchor, and made
our abode full fifteene dayes.</p>
            <p>The very firſt day of our arriuall here, our generall hauing ſet
things in ſome order, for the diſpatch of our neceſſary buſines,
being moſt carefull for his two ſhips which were wanting, ſent
forth to the ſouthward, Captaine Winter in the Elizabeth vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admiral;
himſelf in the admiral, going forth northward, into the
ſea, to ſee, if happily they might meete with either of them:
at which time, by the good prouidence of God, hee himſelfe
met with the Swanne, formerly loſt at our departure from the
riuer of Plate, and brought her into the ſame harbor, the ſame
day: where being afterward vnloaden, and diſcharged of her
fraight, ſhee was caſt off, and her iron worke, and other neceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries
being ſaued, for the better prouiſion of the reſt; of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
was made fire wood, and other implements which we
wanted. But all this while, of the other ſhip which wee loſt ſo
lately, in our extremitie, we could haue no newes.</p>
            <p>While we were thus employed, after certaine dayes of our
ſtay in this place, being on ſhoare, in an Iland, nigh vnto the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:5654:15"/>
maine, where at lowe water was free paſſage on foot, from the
one to the other; the people of the country did ſhew themſelues
vnto vs, with leaping, dancing, and holding vp their hands, and
making ourcries after their manner: but being then high water,
we could not go ouer to them on foot. Wherefore the Generall
cauſed immediatly a boat to bee in readineſſe, and ſent vnto
them ſuch things as he thought would delight them; as kniues,
bells, bugles, &amp;c. whereupon they beeing aſſembled together
vpon a hill, halfe an Engliſh mile from the waters ſide; ſent
downe two of their company, running one after the other with
a great grace, trauerſing their ground as it ſeemed after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of their warres, by degrees deſcending towards the waters
ſide very ſwiftly. Notwithſtanding drawing nigh vnto it, they
made a ſtay, refuſing to come neere our men: which our men
perceiuing, ſent ſuch things as they had tyed with a ſtring vpon
a rod, and ſtucke the ſame vp a reaſonable diſtance from them,
where they might ſee it. And aſſoone as our men were departed
from the place, they came and tooke thoſe things, leauing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of them, as in recompence, ſuch feathers as they vſe to
weare about their heads, with a bone made in manner of a tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick,
carued round about the top, and in length about ſix inches,
being very ſmoothly burniſhed. Whereupon our Generall, with
diuers of his gentlemen and companie, at low water went ouer
to them to the maine.</p>
            <p>Againſt his comming they remained ſtill vpon the hill, and
ſet themſelues in a ranke, one by one; appointing one of their
company to runne before them from the one end of the ranke
to the other, and ſo backe againe, continually Eaſt and Weſt,
with holding vp his hands ouer his head, and yeelding forward
his body in his running toward the riſing and ſetting of the
Sunne: and at euery ſecond or third turne at the moſt, erected
his body, aginſt the midſt of the ranke of the people, lifting
himſelfe vaulting-wiſe from the ground towards the Moone,
being then ouer our heads: ſignifying thereby, as we conceiued,
that they called the Sunne and Moone (whom they ſerue for
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:5654:16"/>
gods) to witneſſe, that they meant nothing towards vs but peace.
But when they perceiued that we aſcended the hill apace, and
drew nigh vnto them, they ſeemed very fearefull of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
            <p>Wherefore our Generall not willing, to giue them any way
any occaſion to miſlike, or be diſcomfited, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>etyred his company;
wherby they were ſo allured, and did ſo therein confirme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
of vs, that we were no enemies, neither meant them harm,
that without al feare diuers came down with great ſpeed after vs,
preſently entring into traffique with our men. Notwithſtanding
they would receiue nothing at our hands but the ſame muſt be
firſt caſt vpon the ground, vſing this word, <hi>Zuſſus,</hi> for exchange
<hi>Tóytt</hi> to caſt vpon the ground. And if they miſliked any thing,
they cryed <hi>Coróh. Coróh,</hi> ſpeaking the ſame with ratling in the
throat. The wares we receiued from them were arrowes of reeds,
feathers, and ſuch bones as are afore deſcribed.</p>
            <p>This people go naked, except a skin of furre which they caſt
about their ſhoulders, when they ſit or lye in the cold: but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
any thing to do, as going or any other labour, they vſe it as
a girdle about their loynes. They weare their haire very long, but
leſt it might trouble them in their trauell, they knit it vp with a
roll of Oſtrich feathers, vſing the ſame rolls and haire together
for a quiuer for their arrowes, and for a ſtore houſe, in which
they carry the moſt things which they carry about them. Some
of them within theſe rolls ſticke on either ſide of their heads
(for a ſigne of honour in their perſons) a large and plaine feather
ſhewing like hornes afarre off: So that ſuch a head vpon a naked
body (if diuels do appeare with hornes) might very nigh reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
diuels.</p>
            <p>Their whole brauery and ſetting out themſelues ſtandeth in
painting their bodies with diuers colours, and ſuch workes as
they can deuiſe. Some waſh their faces with ſulphure, or ſome
ſuch like ſubſtance: ſome paint their whole bodies black, leauing
onely their neckes behind and before White, much like our da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſels
that weare their ſquares, their neckes and breaſts naked.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:5654:16"/>
Some paint one ſhoulder blacke, another white<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their ſides
and legs interchangeably, with the ſame colours, one ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the other. The black part hath ſet vpon it white moones,
and the white part blacke Suns, being the marks and characters
of their gods, as is before noted.</p>
            <p>They haue ſome commodity by painting of their bodies, for
the which cauſe they vſe it ſo generally: and that I gather to be
the defence it yeeldeth againſt the piercing and nipping cold.
For the colours being cloſe layd on vpon their skinne, or rather
in their fleſh, as by continuall renewing of theſe iuyces which
are layed on, ſoakt into the inner part thereof, doth fill vp the
pores ſo cloſe that no aire or cold can enter, or make them once
to ſhrinke.</p>
            <p>They haue cleane, comely, and ſtrong bodies: they are ſwift
of foot, and ſeeme very actiue. Neither is any thing more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
(in my iudgement) then that ſo goodly a people, and
ſo liuely creatures of God, ſhould bee ignorant of the true and
liuing God. And ſo much the more is this to be lamented, by
how much they are more tractable, and eaſie to be brought to
the ſheepfold of Chriſt: hauing in truth a land ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
any Chriſtian Prince in the world, for the whole tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
and labour, coſt and charges beſtowed in that behalfe: with
a wonderfull enlarging of a kingdome, beſides the glory of God
by encreaſing of the Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Its wonderfull to heare, being neuer knowne to Chriſtians
before this time, how familiar they became in ſhort ſpace with
vs; thinking themſelues to be ioyned with ſuch a people, as they
ought rather to ſerue, then offer any wrong or iniurie vnto. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
that they might be bold with our Generall as with a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and with vs as with brethren and their neereſt friends; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſeemed their loue leſſe towards vs. One of the chiefeſt
among them hauing on a time receiued a cap of our Generals
head, which he did daily weare, remouing himſelfe but a little
from vs, with an arrow pierced his legge deepely, cauſing the
bloud to ſtreame out vpon the ground: ſignifying thereby, how
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:5654:17"/>
vnfainedly he loued him, and giuing therin a couenant of peace:
The number of men which here did frequent our companie,
were about fiftie perſons. Within, in the Southermoſt part of
this bay, there is a riuer of freſh water, with a great many profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Ilands; of which, ſome haue alwaies ſuch ſtore of Seales or
ſea-woſues as were able to maintaine a huge army of men. Other
Ilands being many and great, are ſo repleniſhed with birds and
foule, as if there were no other victuals, a wonderfull multitude
of people might be nouriſhed by the increaſe of them for many
poſterities. Of theſe we killed ſome with ſhot, and ſome with
ſtatus, and tooke ſome with our hands, from mens heads and
ſhoulders vpon which they lighted. We could not perceiue that
the people of the countrey had any ſort of boate or canowe, to
come to theſe Ilands. Their owne prouiſion which they eate,
for ought we could perceiue, was commonly raw. For we ſhould
ſometimes find the remnants of Seales all bloudy which they
had gnawne with their teeth like dogs: They go all of them ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
with a ſhort bow of about an ell in length in their hands,
with arrowes of reeds, and headed with a flint ſtone, very cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
cut and faſtned.</p>
            <p>This bay by reaſon of the plenty of <hi>Seales</hi> therein found (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that we killed two hundred in the ſpace of one houre)
we called <hi>Seale, bay.</hi> And hauing now made ſufficient prouiſion
of victuals and other neceſſaries, as alſo happily finiſhed all our

            <p>Here our generall on good aduiſe determined to alter his

courſe; and turne his ſterne to the Northward againe, if happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God would grant we might find our ſhip and friends whom
we loſt in the great ſtorme, as is before ſaid. Foraſmuch as (if we
ſhould enter the Straight without them in our company) it muſt
needs go hard with them; and we alſo in the meane time as well
by their abſence, as by the vncertaintie of their ſtate, muſt needs
receiue no ſmall diſcomfort.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Iune </seg>18</label> And therefore Iune 18. in the morning putting to ſea againe,

as the ſhip was farre out of order, and very leake, by reaſon of
extremity of weather which ſhe had endured, aſwell before her

to beare into Port Saint <hi>Iulian</hi> with his fleet, becauſe it was ſo

            <p>Being now come to anchor, and all things fitted and made

rowed further in with a boate to find out ſome conuenient
place which might yeeld vs freſh water, during the time of our
abode there, and furniſh vs with ſupply for prouiſion, to take to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:5654:18"/>
ſea with vs at our departure. Which worke as it was of great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie,
and therefore carefully to be performed; ſo did not he
thinke himſelfe diſcharged of his duty, if he himſelfe beſtowed
not the firſt trauell therein, as his vſe was at all times in all other
things, belonging to the relieuing of our wants, and the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of our good eſtate, by the ſupply of what was needfull.
Preſently vpon his landing he was viſited by two of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the place, whom <hi>Magellane</hi> named <hi>Patagous,</hi> or rather
<hi>Pentagours</hi> from their huge ſtature, and ſtrength proportionable:
Theſe as they ſeemed greatly to reioyce at his arriuall, ſo did
they ſhew themſelues very familiar, receiuing at our Generals
hands whatſoeuer he gaue them, and taking great pleaſure in
ſeeing Maſter <hi>Oliuer</hi> maſter gunner of the Admirall, to ſhoot
an Engliſh arrow: trying with him to ſhoot at length, but came
nothing neere him.</p>
            <p>Not long after, came one more of the ſame laſte, but of a
ſowerer ſorte, for he, miſliking of the familiarity which his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
had vſed, ſeemed very angry with them, and ſtroue ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
to withdrawe them, and to turne them to become our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies;
Which our generall with his men not ſuſpecting in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
vſed them as before: and one Mr. Robert Winter, thinking of
pleaſure to ſhoote an arrow at length, as Mr. Oliuer had done
before, that he which came laſt alſo might haue a ſight thereof,
the ſtring of his bow brake; which, as before it was a terror vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, ſo now broken, it gaue them great incouragement, and
boldnes, and as they thought, great aduantage in their treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
intent and purpoſe; not imagining that our calliuers,
ſwords, and targets, were any munition or weapon of warre.</p>
            <p>In which perſwaſion (as the generall with his companie
were, quietly without any ſuſpition of euill, going downe
towards his boate) they ſodainely being prepared, and gotten by
ſtealth behinde them, ſhot their arrowes; and cheifely at him
which had the bowe, not ſuffering him to ſtring the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
which he was about to haue done, as well as hee could:
but being wounded in the ſhoulder at the firſt ſhot, and turning
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:5654:18"/>
about, was ſped with an arrow, which peirced his lunges, yet he
fell not. But the Mr. gunner being ready to ſhoote of his calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
which tooke not fire in leuelling thereof, was preſently
ſlaine out right. In this extremitie, if our generall had not beene
both expert in ſuch affaires, able to judge, and giue preſent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
in the danger thereof, and had not valiantly thruſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
into the dance, againſt theſe monſters, there had no one of
our men, that there were landed, eſcaped with life. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
giuing order that no man ſhould keepe any certaine
ground, but ſhift from place to place, encroaching ſtill vpon the
enemie, vſing their targets, and other weapons for the defence
of their bodies, and that they ſhould breake ſo many arrowes, as
by any meanes they could come by, being ſhot at them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he himſelfe was very diligent, and carefull alſo in calling on
them, knowing that their arrowes being once ſpent, they ſhould
haue theſe enemies at their deuotion and pleaſure, to kill or
ſaue, and this order being accordingly taken, himſelfe I ſay with
a good courage and truſt in the true and liuing God, taking and
ſhooting off, the ſame peece, which the gunner could not make
to take fire, diſpatched the firſt beginner of the quarrell, the ſame
man which ſlewe our Mr. gunner. For the peece being charged
with a bullet, and haile ſhot, and well aimed, tare out his bellie
and gutts, with great torment, as it ſeemed by his cry, which
was ſo hideous and horrible a roare, as if ten bulls had ioyned
together in roaring, wherewith the courage of his partners was
ſo abated, and their hearts appalled, that notwithſtanding, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe
of their fellowes and countriemen appeared out of the
woods, on each ſide: yet they were glad, by flying away, to
ſaue themſelues, quietly ſuffering our men either to depart or
ſtay. Our generall choſe rather to depart, then to take further
reuenge of them, which now he might, by reaſon of his woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
man, whom for many good parts he loued dearely; and
therefore would rather haue ſaued him, then ſlaine an hundred
enemies, but being paſt recouery, he died the 2. day, after his
being brought aboard againe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:5654:19"/>
That night our Mr. gunners body being left aſhoare, for the
ſpeedier bringing of the other aboard, our generall himſelfe the
next day, with his boate well appointed, turned to the ſhoare,
to fetch it likewiſe: which they found lying where it was left,
but ſtript of his vppermoſt garment, and hauing an engliſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
ſtucke in his right eye.</p>
            <p>Both of theſe dead bodies were layd together in one graue,
with ſuch reuerence, as was fit for the earthen tabernacles of
immortall ſoules; and with ſuch commendable ceremonies, as
belong vnto ſouldiers of worth, in time of warre, which they
moſt truly and rightfully deſerued.</p>
            <p>Magellane was not altogether deceiued, in naming them
Giants; for they generally differ from the common ſort of
men, both in ſtature, bignes, and ſtrength of body, as alſo in
the hideouſneſſe of their voice: but yet they are nothing ſo
monſtrous, or giantlike as they were reported; there being
ſome Engliſh men, as tall, as the higheſt of any that we could
ſee, but peraduenture, the Spaniards did not thinke, that euer,
any Engliſh man would come thither, to reproue them; and
therevpon might preſume the more boldly to lie: the name
<hi>Pentagones, Fiue cubits</hi> viz. 7. foote and halfe, deſcribing the full
height (if not ſome what more) of the higheſt of them.</p>
            <p>But this is certaine, that the Spaniſh cruelties there vſed,
haue made them more monſtrous, in minde and manners, then
they are in body; and more inhoſpitable, to deale with any
ſtrangers, that ſhall come hereafter. For the loſſe of their friends
(the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance wherof is aſſigned and conueighed ouer from
one generation to another, among their poſteritie) breedeth an
old grudge, which will not eaſily be forgotten, with ſo quarrell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
and revengefull a people. Notwithſtanding the terrour
which they had conceiued of vs, did henceforward ſo quench
their heate, and take downe their edge, that they both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
reuenge, and ſeeming by their countenance, to repent
them of the wrong they had offered vs, that meant them no
harme, ſuffered vs to doe what we would, the whole ſpace of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:5654:19"/>
two monethes after this, without any interruption or moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by them, and it may perhaps be a meanes, to breede
a peace in that people, towards all that may hereafter this,
come that way.</p>
            <p>To this euill, thus receiued at the hands of infidells, there was
adioyned, and grew another miſchiefe, wrought and contriued
cloſely amongſt our ſelues, as great, yea farre greater, and of farre
more greiuous conſequence then the former: but that it was,
by Gods prouidence, detected and preuented in time, which
elſe had extended it ſelfe, not onely to the violent ſhedding of
innocent blood, by murthering our generall and ſuch others as
were moſt firme and faithfull to him: but alſo to the finall ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of the whole action intended, and to diuers other moſt
dangerous effects.</p>
            <p>Theſe plotts had beene layd before the voyage beganne in
England: the very modell of them was ſhewed, and declared to
our generall in his garden at Plimmouth, before his ſetting ſayle,
which yet he either would not credit, as true or likely, of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
whom he loued ſo deerely, and was perſwaded of to loue
him likewiſe vnfainedly, or thought by loue and benefits, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue
and remedy it, if there were any euill purpoſes conceiued
againſt him.</p>
            <p>And therfore, he did not onely continue (to this ſuſpected &amp;
accuſed perſon) al countenance, credit, and courteſies, which he
was wont to ſhew &amp; giue him, but encreaſed them, vſing him in
a manner as another himſelfe, and as his moſt inmoſt friend:
lodging him with himſelfe; giuing him the ſecond place, in all
companies, in his preſence; leauing in his hand, the ſtate as it
were of his owne perſon; in his abſence; imparting vnto him
all his counſells; allowing him free liberty in all things, that
were reaſonable; and bearing often, at his hands great infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
yea deſpiſing, that any priuate iniury, ſhould breake ſo
firme a friendſhip, as he meant towards him. And therefore, was
he often times not a little offended, euen with thoſe, who (vpon
conſcience of their duty, and knowledge that otherwiſe they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:5654:20"/>
ſhould indeed offend) diſcloſed from time to time vnto him,
how the fire increaſed, that theatned his owne, together with
the deſtruction of the whole action.</p>
            <p>But at length, perceiuing that his lenity and fauours did little
good; in that the heat of ambition was not yet allayed, nor
could be quenched, as it ſeemed, but by blood; and that the
manifold practiſes grew dayly more and more, euen to extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
he thought it high time, to call theſe practiſes into queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
before it were too late, to call any queſtion of them into
hearing. And therefore ſetting good watch ouer him, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
all his Captaines, and gentlemen of his comapany to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
he propounded to them, the good parts which were in
the gentleman, the great good will, and inward affection, more
then brotherly, which he had euer, ſince his firſt acquaintance
borne him, not omitting the reſpect, which was had of him,
among no meane perſonages in England; and afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
the letters, which were written to him, with the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
from time to time, which had beene obſerued, not ſo much
by himſelfe, as by his good friends; not onely at ſea, but euen
at Plimmouth; not bare words but writings; not writings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
but actions, tending to the ouerthrowe of the ſeruice in
hand, and making away of his perſon.</p>
            <p>Proofes were required and alleaged, ſo many, and ſo euident,
that the gentleman himſelfe, ſtricken with remorſe of his incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate
and vnkinde dealing, acknowledged himſelfe to haue
deſerued death, yea many deathes; for that he conſpired, not
onely the ouerthrow of the action, but of the principall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
alſo, who was not a ſtranger or il-willer, but a deare and
true friend vnto him: and therefore in a great aſſembly open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beſought them, in whoſe hands iuſtice reſted, to take ſome
order for him; that he might not be compelled, to enforce his
owne hands, againſt his owns bowells, or otherwiſe to become
his owne executioner.</p>
            <p>The admiration and aſtoniſhment hereat, in all the hearers
euen thoſe which were his neereſt friends, and moſt affected him
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:5654:20"/>
was great, yea in thoſe, which for many benefits receiued from
him, had good cauſe to loue him: but yet the generall was
moſt of all diſtracted; and therefore withdrewe himſelfe, as not
able to conceale his tender affection, requiring them, that had
heard the whole matter, to giue their iudgements, as they would
another day anſwer it vnto their prince, and vnto almightie
God, judge of all the earth. Therefore they all, aboue 40. in
number, the chiefeſt of place and judgement in the whole fleet,
after they had diſcuſſed diuerſly of the caſe, and alleaged what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
came in their mindes, or could be there produced by any
of his other friends, with their owne hands, vnder ſeale, adiudged
that: <hi>He had deſerued death: And that it ſtoode, by no meanes
with their ſafety, to let him liue: And therefore, they remitted the
manner thereof, with the reſt of the circumſtances to the generall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This judgement, and as it were aſſiſe, was held a land, in one
of the Ilands of that port; which afterwards, in memory hereof
was called, the Iland of <hi>True iuſtice and iudgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now after this verdict was thus returned vnto our generall
(vnto whom, for his company, her maieſtie before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
had committed her ſword, to vſe for his ſafety, with this
word: <hi>We doe account that he which ſtriketh at thee Drake ſtriketh
at vs</hi>) he called for the guilty party, and cauſed to be read vnto
him, the ſeuerall verdicts which were written, and pronounced
of him, which being acknowledged for the moſt part (for none
had giuen heauier ſentence againſt him, then he had giuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
himſelfe) our generall propoſed vnto him this choice:
<hi>whether he would take, to be executed in this Iland? or to be ſett a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
on the maine? or returne into England, there to anſwer his
deed before the Lords of her maieſties Councell?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He moſt humbly thanked the generall for his clemencie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
towards him in ſuch ample ſort: and crauing ſome reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,
to conſult thereon, and ſo make his choice aduiſedly: the
next day he returned this anſwer, that: <hi>Albeit he had yeelded in
his heart, to entertaine ſo great a ſinne; as whereof now he was iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
condemned: yet he bad a care, and that excelling all other cares,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:5654:21"/>
to die a chriſtian man, that whatſoeuer did become of his clay body, he
might yet remaine aſſured of an eternall inheritance, in a farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
life. This he feared, if he ſhould be ſet a land among Infidels, how
he ſhould be able to maintaine this aſſurance, feeling in his owne
frailtie, how mighty the contagion is of lewde cuſtome. <hi>And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he beſought the generall moſt earneſtly, that</hi> he would yet
haue a care, and regard of his ſoule; and neuer jeopard it amongſt
heathen and ſauage Infidells. If he ſhould returne into England, he
muſt firſt haue a ſhip, and men to conduct it, with ſufficient victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als:
two of which though they were had, yet for the third, he
thought no man would accompanie him, in ſo bad a meſſage to ſo vile
an iſſue, from ſo honorable a ſeruice. But if that there were, which
could induce their mindes, to returne with him; yet the very ſhame
of the returne, would be as death, or grieuouſer if it were poſſible: he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
be ſhould be ſo long a dying, and die ſo often. Therefore he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
that with all his heart, he did embrace the firſt branch of the
generals proffer; deſiring onely this fauour, that they might receiue
the holy communion, once againe together before his death; and that
he might not die, other then a gentlemans death.</p>
            <p>Though ſundry reaſons were vſed by many, to perſwade him
to take either of the other wayes: yet when he remained reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
in his former determination, both parts of his laſt requeſt
were granted: and the next conuenient day, a communion was
celebrated, by <hi>Mr. Francis Fletcher,</hi> preacher and paſtor of the
fleet at that time. The generall himſelfe communicated in this
Sacred ordinance, with this condemned penitent gentleman;
who ſhewed great tokens of a contrite and repentant heart, as
who was more deepely diſpleaſed with his owne act, then any
man elſe. And after this holy repaſt, they dined alſo at the ſame
table together, as cheerefully in ſobriety, as euer in their liues
they had done aforetime: each cheering vp the other, and
taking their leaue, by drinking each to other, as if ſome journey
onely had beene in hand.</p>
            <p>After dinner, all things being brought in a readines, by him
that ſupplied the roome of the prouoſt Marshall; without any
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:5654:21"/>
dallying, or dolaying the time, he came forth, and kneeled
downe, preparing at once, his necke for the axe, and his ſpirit
for heauen: which hauing done, without long ceremony, as
who had before digeſted this whole tragedy, he deſired all the

not to feare nor ſpare.</p>
            <p>Thus hauing by the worthie manner of his, death (being
much more honorable by it, then blameable for any other of his
actions) fully blotted out, what euer ſtaine, his fault might
ſeeme to bring vpon him; he left vnto our fleete, a lamentable
example of a goodly gentleman, who in ſeeking aduancement
vnfit for him, caſt away himſelfe: and vnto poſteritie a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of I know not what, fatall calamitie, incident to that Port,
and ſuch like actions, which might happilie afford a new paire
of paralells, to be added to Plutarchs: in that the ſame place,
neere about the ſame time of the yeare, witneſſed the execution
of 2. gentlemen, ſuffring both for the like cauſe, employed both
in like ſeruice, entertained both in great place, endued both
with excellent qualities, the one 58. yeare after the other.</p>
            <p>For on the maine, our men found a gibbet, fallen downe,
made of a ſpruce maſt, with mens bones vnderneath it, which
they coniectured to be the ſame gibbet, which Magellane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to be erected, in the yeare 1520. for the execution, of
<hi>Iohn Carthagene</hi> the Biſhop of Burgos coſen, who by the kings
order, was ioyned with Magellane in commiſſion, and made his
vice-admirall.</p>
            <p>In the Iland, as we digged to burie this gentleman, we found
a great grinding ſtone, broken in two parts, which wee tooke
and ſet faſt in the ground, the one part at the head, the other at
the feet, building vp the middle ſpace, with other ſtones and
turfes of earth, and engraued in the ſtones, the names of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
buried there, with the time of their departure, and a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
of our generalls name in Latine, that it might the better be
vnderſtood, of all that ſhould come after vs.</p>
            <p>Theſe things thus ended, and ſet in order, our generall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging

the <hi>Mary</hi> viz. our Portugall priſe, becauſe ſhee was
leake and troubleſome, defaced her; and then left her ribs and
keele vpon the Iland: where for two moneths together we had
pitched our tents. And ſo hauing wooded, watered, trimmed
our ſhips, diſpatched all our other buſineſſes, and brought our
fleet into the ſmalleſt number, euen 3. onely, beſides our pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that we might the eaſier keepe our ſelues together, be the

what ſoeuer need ſhould be, Auguſt 17. we departed out
of this port, and being now in great hope, of a happie iſſue to
our enterpriſe, which almighty god hitherto had ſo bleſt and
proſpered, we ſet our courſe for the Straights. Southweſt.</p>
            <p>Auguſt 20. we fel with the cape; neere which lies the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the ſtraight, called by the Spaniards <hi>Capo virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
appearing 4. leagues before you come to it with high and
ſteepe gray cliffes, full of blacke ſtarres, againſt which the ſea
beating, ſheweth as it were the ſpoutings of Whales, hauing the
higheſt of the cape, like cape vincent in Portugall: At this cape,
our generall cauſed his fleet, in homage to our ſoueraigne lady
the Queenes maieſty, to ſtrike their top-ſailes vpon the bunt,
as a token of his willing and glad minde, to ſhewe his dutifull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to her highnes, whom he acknowledged to haue full
intereſt and right, in that new diſcouery; and withall, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of his honorable friend and fauorer, <hi>Sir Chriſtopher
Hatton,</hi> he changed the name of the ſhippe, which himſelfe went
in, from the <hi>Pellican</hi> to be called <hi>the golden Hinde.</hi> Which cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
being ended, together with a ſermon, teaching true o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
with prayers and giuing of thankes for her maieſty,
and moſt honorable counſell, with the whole body of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
weale, and church of God, we continued our courſe on
into the ſaid frete, where paſſing with land in fight on both ſides,
we ſhortly fell with ſo narrow a ſtraite, as carrying with it much
winde, often turnings, and many dangers, requireth an expert
judgement, in him that ſhall paſſe the ſame, it lieth Weſt North
Weſt &amp; Eaſt South Eaſt: but hauing left this ſtraite a ſterne, we
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:5654:22"/>
ſeemed to be come out of a riuer of two leagues broade, into a
large and maine ſea, hauing the night following, an Iland in
ſight, which (being in height nothing inferior to the Iland <hi>Fogo,</hi>
before ſpoken of) burneth (like it aloft) alſo in the aire, in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
ſort, without intermiſſion.</p>
            <p>It hath formerly beene receiued as an vndoubted truth, that
the ſeas, following the courſe of the firſt mouer, from Eaſt to
Weſt, haue a continuall current through this ſtraite, but our
experience found the contrary: the ebbings and flowings here,
being as orderly (in which the water riſes and falls more then 5.
fathomes, vpright) as on other coaſts.</p>
            <p>The 24 of Auguſt being Bartholomew day, we fell with 3.
Ilands, bearing triangle-wiſe one from another, one of them
was very faire and large, and of a fruitfull ſoile, vpon which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
next vnto vs, and the weather very calme, our generall with
his gentlemen, and certaine of his mariners, then landed; taking
poſſeſſion thereof in her Maieſties name, and to her vſe, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the ſame <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Iland.</p>
            <p>The other two, though they were not ſo large, nor ſo faire to
the eye, yet were they to vs exceeding vſefull, for in them wee
found great ſtore of ſtrange birds, which could not flie at all, nor
yet runne ſo faſt, as that they could eſcape vs with their liues: in
body they are leſſe then a gooſe, and bigger then a mallard,
ſhort and thicke ſet together, hauing no feathers, but inſteed
thereof, a certaine hard and matted downe; their beakes are not
much vnlike the bills of crowes, they lodge and breed vpon the
land, where making earthes, as the conies doe, in the ground,
they lay their egges, and bring vp their young; their feeding
and prouiſion to liue on, is in the ſea, where they ſwimm in ſuch
ſort, as nature may ſeeme to haue granted them no ſmall prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue
in ſwiftneſſe, both to prey vpon others, and themſelues to
eſcape from any others that ſeeke to ceaſe vpon them, and ſuch
was the infinite reſort of theſe birds to theſe Ilands, that in the
ſpace of 1. day, we killed no leſſe then 3000. &amp; if the increaſe be
according to the number, it is not to be thought, that the world
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:5654:23"/>
hath brought forth, a greater bleſſing in one kinde of creature
in ſo ſmall a circuit, ſo neceſſarily and plentifully ſeruing the vſe
of man, they are a very good and wholeſome victuall: our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
named theſe Ilands, the one <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> according to
the day; the other Saint <hi>Georges,</hi> in honour of England, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the ancient cuſtome there obſerued.</p>
            <p>In the Iland of Saint <hi>George,</hi> we found the body of a man, ſo
long dead before, that his bones would not hold together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
moued out of the place whereon they lay.</p>
            <p>From theſe Ilands, to the entrance into the South ſea, the
frete is very crooked; hauing many turnings, and as it were ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
vp, as if there were no paſſage at all, by meanes whereof, we
were often troubled with contrary windes, ſo that ſome of our
ſhips, recouering a cape of land, entring another reach, the reſt
were forced to alter their courſe, and come to anchor where
they might. It is true which Magellane reporteth of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage:
namely that there be many faire harbours, and ſtore of
freſh water; but ſome ſhips, had need to be fraughted with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe, beſides anchors and cables, to finde ground, in moſt
of them, to come to anchor; which when any extreame guſts,
or contrary windes doe come (whereunto the place is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſubiect) is a great hindrance to the paſſage and carrieth
with it no ſmall danger.</p>
            <p>The land on both ſides is very high and mountainous, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
on the North and Weſt ſide the continent of America,
and on the South and Eaſt part, nothing but Ilands: among
which, lye innumerable fretes or paſſages into the South ſea.
The mountaines ariſe with ſuch tops, and ſpires into the aire, &amp;
of ſo rare a height, as they may well be accounted amongſt the
wonders of the world; enuironed as it were, with many regions
of congealed clouds, and frozen meteors, wherby they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
fed and increaſed, both in height and bignes, from time
to time, retaining that which they haue once receiued, being
little againe diminiſhed by the heate of the ſun, as being ſo farre
from reflexion, and ſo nigh the cold and frozen region.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:5654:23"/>
But notwithſtanding all this, yet are the lowe and plaine
groundes verie fruitful, the graſſe greene and naturall; the hearbs
that are of very ſtrange ſorts, good and many; the trees for
the moſt part of them alwaies greene; the ayre of the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of our countrey, the water moſt pleaſant; and the ſoile
agreeing to any graine which we haue growing in our countrie:
a place no doubt, that lacketh nothing, but a people to vſe the
ſame to the Creators glory, and the encreaſing of the Church:
the people inhabiting theſe parts, made fires as we paſſed by in
diuers places.</p>
            <p>Drawing nigh the entrance of the South ſea, wee had ſuch a
ſhutting vp to the Northwards, and ſuch large and open fretes
toward the South, that it was doubtfull which way wee ſhould
paſſe, without further diſcouerie: for which cauſe, our generall
hauing brought his fleete to anchor vnder an Iland; himſelfe,
with certaine of his gentlemen, rowed in a boate to deſcrie the
paſſage; who hauing diſcouered a ſufficient way towards the
North, in their returne to their ſhips, met a cannowe vnder the
ſame Iland, where wee rode then at anchor, hauing in her diuers
perſons.</p>
            <p>This cannowe or boate was made of the barke of diuers
trees, hauing a prowe and a ſterne ſtanding vp, and ſemicircle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
yeelding inward, of one forme and faſhion; the body
whereof was a moſt dainty mould, bearing in it moſt comely
proportion, and excellent workmanſhip; in ſo much as to our
generall and vs, it ſeemed neuer to haue beene done, without
the cunning and expert iudgement of art; and that not for the
vſe of ſo rude and barborous a people, but for the pleaſure of
ſome great and noble perſonage, yea of ſome Prince: It had no
other cloſing vp or caulking in the ſeames, but the ſtitchin with
thongs, made of Seale-skins, or other ſuch beaſt, and yet ſo cloſe
that it receiued very little or no water at all.</p>
            <p>The people are of a meane ſtature, but well ſet and compact,
in all their parts and limmes; they haue great pleaſure in pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their faces, as the others haue, of whom we haue ſpoken
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:5654:24"/>
before. Within the ſaid Iland they had a houſe of meane buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
of certaine poles, and couered with skinnes of beaſt; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
therein fire, water, and ſuch meate, as commonly they can
come by: as ſeales, muſſels, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>The veſſels wherein they keepe their water, and their cups in
which they drinke, are made of barkes of trees, as was their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now:
and that with no leſſe skill (for the bigneſſe of the thing)
being of a very formall ſhape and good faſhion. Their working
tooles, which they vſe in cutting theſe things and ſuch other,
are kniues made of moſt huge and monſtrous muſſell ſhels (the
like whereof haue not beene ſeene or heard of lightly by any
trauellers; the meate thereof beeing very ſauourie and good in
eating) which, after they haue broken off the thinne and brittle
ſubſtance of the edge, they rub and grinde them vpon ſtones
had for the purpoſe, till they haue tempered and ſet ſuch an edge
vpon them, that no wood is ſo hard but they will cut it at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
with the ſame: whereof we our ſelues had experience. Yea
they cut therewith bones of a maruellous hardneſſe; making of
them fiſgies to kill fiſh, wherein they haue a moſt pleaſant exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
with great dexteritie.</p>

his whole company to haue gone aſhore, and there after a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to haue left a monument of her Maieſtie ingrauen in met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
for a perpetuall remembrance; which he had in a readineſſe
for that end prepared: but neither was there any anchoring,
neither did the wind ſuffer vs by any meanes to make a ſtay.</p>
            <p>Onely this by all our mens obſeruations was concluded; that
the entrance, by which we came into this ſtraite, was in 52. deg.
the middeſt in 53. deg. 15. m and the going out in 52. deg. 30. m.
being 150. leagues in length: At the very entry, ſuppoſed alſo
to be about 10. leagues in bredth. After we were entred ten
leagues within it, it was found not paſt a league in breadth: far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
within, in ſome places very large, in ſome very narrow, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:5654:24"/>
in the end found to be no ſtraite at all, but all Ilands.</p>
            <p>Now when our Generall perceiued that the nipping cold, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſo cruell and frowning a Winter, had empaired the health
of ſome of his men; hee meant to haue made the more haſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine

the mouth of the ſtraits againe (which wee were now ſo

came forward, and ſo coaſting Braſill, they arriued in England
Iune 2. the yeare following.</p>
            <p>So that now our Admirall if ſhe had retained her old name
of Pellican, which ſhe bare at our departure from our countrey,
ſhe might haue beene now indeed ſaid to be as a Pellican alone
in the wilderneſſe. For albeit our Generall ſought the reſt of his
fleet with great care, yet could we not haue any ſight or certaine
ne wes of them by any meanes.</p>
            <p>From this bay of parting of friends, we were forcibly driuen
backe againe into 55. deg. towards the pole Antarticke. In
which height we ranne in among the Ilands before mentioned,
lying to the Southward of America, through which we paſſed
from one ſea to the other, as hath beene declared. Where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to anchor, wee found the waters there to haue their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draught
and free paſſage, and that through no ſmall guts, or nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
channels, but indeed through as large frets or ſtraights, as
it hath at the ſuppoſed ſtreights of Magellane through which we
came.</p>
            <p>Among theſe Ilands, making our abode with ſome quietneſſe
for a very little while,(viz. two dayes) and finding diuers good
and wholeſome herbs together with freſh water; our men which
before were weake, and much empaired in their health, began to
receiue good comfort: eſpecially by the drinking of one herbe
(not much vnlike that herbe which wee commonly call Penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe)
which purging with great facilitie affoorded great helpe
and refreſhing to our wearied and ſickly bodies. But the winds
returning to their old wont, and the ſeas raging after their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
manner, yea euery thing as it were ſetting it ſelfe againſt our

ſafety to be looked for.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:5654:26"/>
For ſuch was the preſent danger by forcing and continuall
ſlawes, that we were rather to looke for preſent death then hope
for any deliuery, if God almightie ſhould not make the way for
vs. The winds were ſuch as if the bowels of the earth had ſet all
at libertie; or as if all the clouds vnder heauen had beene called
together, to lay their force vpon that one place: The ſeas, which
by nature and of themſelues are heauie, and of a weightie ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
were rowled vp from the depths, euen from the roots of
the rockes, as if it had beene a ſcroll of parchment, which by the
extremity of heate runneth together: and being aloft were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in moſt ſtrange manner and abundance, as feathers or drifts
of ſnow, by the violence of the winds, to water the exceeding
tops of high and loftie mountaines. Our anchors, as falſe friends
in ſuch a danger, gaue ouer their holdfaſt, and as if it had beene
with horror of the thing, did ſhrinke downe to hide themſelues
in this miſerable ſtorme; committing the diſtreſſed ſhip and
helpeleſſe men to the vncertaine and rowling ſeas, which toſſed
them, like a ball in a racket. In this caſe, to let fall more anchors,
would auaile vs nothing; For being driuen from our firſt place
of anchoring, ſo vnmeaſurable was the depth, that 500. fathome
would fetch no ground: So that the violent ſtorme without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion;
the impoſſibility to come to anchor; the want of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie
to ſpread any ſayle, the moſt mad ſeas; the lee ſhores;
the dangerous rocks; the contrary and moſt intollerable winds;
the impoſſible paſſage out; the deſperate tarrying there; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euitable
perils on euery ſide, did lay before vs ſo ſmall likelihood
to eſcape preſent deſtruction, that if the ſpeciall prouidence of
God himſelfe had not ſupported vs, we could neuer haue endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that wofull ſtate: as being inuironed with moſt terrible and
moſt fearefull iudgements round about. For truly, it was more
likely that the mountaines ſhould haue beene rent in ſunder,
from the top to the bottome, and caſt headlong into the ſea, by
theſe vnnaturall winds; then that, we, by any helpe or cunning
of man, ſhould free the life of any one amongſt vs.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the ſame God of mercy which deliuered

               <hi>Ionas</hi> out of the Whales belly, and heareth all thoſe that call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

beheld our teares, and heard our humble petitions, ioyned with
holy vowes. Euen God (whom not the winds and ſeas al one,
but euen the diuels themſelues and powers of hell obey) did ſo
wonderfully free vs, and make our way open before vs, as it were
by his holy Angels ſtill guiding and conduting vs, that more
then the affright and amaze of this eſtate, we receiued no part of
damage in all the things that belonged vnto vs.</p>
            <p>But eſcaping from theſe ſtraites and miſeries, as it were
through the needles ey (that God might haue the greater glory
in our deliuery) by the great and effectuall care and trauell of

intollerable toyles: the like whereof, its to be ſuppoſed, no tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueller
hath felt, neither hath there euer beene, ſuch a tempeſt
(that any records make mention of) ſo violent, and of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
ſince <hi>Noahs</hi> flood, for as hath beene ſayd it laſted
from September 7. to October 28, full 52. dayes.</p>
            <p>Not many leagues therefore to the Southwards of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
anchoring, we ranne in againe among theſe Ilands; where
we had once more better likelihood to reſt in peace: and ſo
much the rather, for that wee found the people of the countrie,
trauelling for their liuing, from one Iland to another, in their
canowes, both men, women, and young infants wrapt in skins,
and hanging at their mothers backs; with whom we had traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique,
for ſuch things as they had, as chaines of certaine ſhells
and ſuch other trifles; here the Lord gaue vs three dayes to
breath our ſelues, and to prouide ſuch things as we wanted, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
the ſame was with continuall care, and troubles to auoid
imminent dangers, which the troubled ſeas and bluſtering
windes, did euery houre threaten vnto vs.</p>
            <p>But when we ſeemed to haue ſtayed there too long, we were
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:5654:27"/>
more rigorouſly aſſaulted by the not formerly ended, but now
more violently renewed ſtorme; and driuen thence alſo with no
ſmall danger; leauing behind vs the greater part of our cable
with the anchor; being chaſed along by the winds, and buffeted
inceſſantly in each quarter by the ſeas (which our Generall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted,
as though God had ſent them of purpoſe to the end
which enſued) till at length wee fell with the vttermoſt part of
land towards the South pole, and had certainely diſcouered how
farre the ſame doth reach Southward, from the coaſt of America
aforenamed.</p>
            <p>The vttermoſt cape or hedland of all theſe Ilands, ſtands
neere in 56. deg. without which there is no maine, nor Iland to
be ſeene to the Southwards: but that the Atlanticke Ocean, and
the South ſea, meete in a moſt large and free ſcope.</p>
            <p>It hath beene a dreame through many ages, that theſe Ilands
haue beene a maine, and that it hath beene <hi>terra incognita;</hi>
wherein many ſtrange monſters liued. Indeed it might truly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this time, be called <hi>incognota,</hi> for howſouer the mappes and
generall deſcriptions of <hi>Coſmographers,</hi> either vpon the deceiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
reports of other men, or the deceitfull imaginations of
themſelues (ſuppoſing neuer herein to be corrected) haue ſet it
downe, yet it is true, that before this time, it was neuer diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
or certainely knowne by any traueller, that wee haue heard
of.</p>
            <p>And here as in a fit place, it ſhall not be amiſſe, to remoue
that error in opinion, which hath beene held by many, of the
impoſſible returne, out of <hi>Mar Del Zur,</hi> into the Weſt Ocean;
by reaſon of the ſuppoſed Eaſterne current, and leuant windes:
which (ſay they) ſpeedily carrie any thither, but ſuffer no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.
They are herein likewiſe altogether deceiued: for neither
did we meete with any ſuch current, neither had we any ſuch cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
windes, with any ſuch ſpeed to carry vs through; but at
all times, in our paſſage there, we found more opportunity to
returne backe againe, into the Weſt Ocean, then to goe forward
into <hi>Mar Del zur,</hi> by meanes either of current, or windes to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:5654:27"/>
hinder vs, whereof we had experience more then we wiſhed:
being glad oftentimes, to alter our courſe, and to fall aſterne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
with francke winde (without any impediment of any
ſuch ſurmiſed current) farther in one afternoone, then we could
fetch vp, or recouer againe in a whole day, with a reaſonable
gale. And in that they alleage the narrownes of the frete, and
want of ſea-roome, to be the cauſe of this violent current; they
are herein no leſſe deceiued, then they were in the other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reaſon: for beſides, that it cannot be ſayd, that there is one
onely paſſage, but rather innumerable it is moſt certaine, that
a ſea-board all theſe Ilands, there is one large and maine ſea,
wherein if any will not be ſatisfied, nor belieue the report of our
experience and ey-ſight, hee ſhould be aduiſed to ſuſpend his
iudgement, till he haue either tried it himſelfe, by his owne
trauell, or ſhall vnderſtand, by other trauellers, more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
to confirme his minde herein.</p>
            <p>Now as wee were fallen to the vttermoſt part of theſe Ilands
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Octob. </seg>28</label> Octob. 28. our troubles did make an end, the ſtorme ceaſed, and
all our calamities (onely the abſence of our friends excepted)
were remoued, as if God, all this while, by his ſecret proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
had lead vs to make this diſcouery; which being made,
according to his will he ſtayed his hand, as pleaſed his maieſtie
therein, and refreſhed vs as his ſeruants.</p>
            <p>At theſe Southerly parts we found the night, in the latter
end of October, to be but 2. houres long: the ſunne being yet
aboue 7. degrees diſtant from the Tropick: ſo that it ſeemeth,
being in the Tropick, to leaue very little, or no night at all in
that place.</p>
            <p>There be few of all theſe Ilands, but haue ſome inhabitants,

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Octob. </seg>30</label> After two daies ſtay, which wee made in and about theſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,
the 30. of October we ſet ſaile; ſhaping our courſe right

North weſt, to coaſt alongſt the parts of <hi>Peru</hi> (for ſo the generall

ſpeed, full with the height of 30. deg. being the place
appointed, for the reſt of our fleete to re-aſſemble; as alſo, that
no opportunity might be loſt, in the meane time to finde them
out, if it ſeemed good to God to direct them to vs.</p>
            <p>In this courſe, we chanced (the next day) with two Ilands,
being as it were ſtore houſes, of moſt liberall prouiſion of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls

ſtore, for vs who were preſent, but enough, to haue ſerued all

            <p>Thence (hauing furniſhed our ſelues to our content) we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
our courſe Nouember 1. ſtill Northweſt, as wee had
formerly done, but in going on, we ſoone eſpied, that we might
eaſily haue beene deceiued: and therefore caſting about,
and ſteering vpon another point, wee found, that the generall
mappes did erre from the truth, in ſetting downe the coaſt of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru,</hi>
for 12. deg. at leaſt to the Northward, of the ſuppoſed
ſtraite; no leſſe then is the Northweſt point of the compaſſe,
different from the Northeaſt, perceiuing hereby, that no man,
had euer by trauell, diſcouered any part of theſe 12. deg. and
therefore the ſetters forth of ſuch deſcriptions, are not to be
truſted; much leſſe honored, in their falſe and fraudulent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectures;
which they vſe, not in this alone, but in diuers other
points of no ſmall importance.</p>
            <p>We found this part of <hi>Peru,</hi> all alongſt to the height of <hi>Lima,</hi>
which is 12. deg. South of the line, to be mountainous and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
barren, without water or wood, for the moſt part, except in
certaine places, inhabited by the Spaniards, and few others,
which are very fruitfull and commodious.</p>
            <p>After we were once againe thus fallen with the land, we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
coaſted along, til we came to the height of 37. d. or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about:
and finding no conuenient place of abode, nor likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Nou. </seg>25</label> At this Iland comming to anchor, Nouemb. 25. we found it
to be a fruitfull place, and well ſtored with ſundrie ſorts of good
things: as ſheepe and other cattell, maize, which is a kinde of
graine whereof they make bread, potatoes, with ſuch other
rootes: beſides that, it is thought to be wonderfull rich in gold
and to want no good thing for the vſe of mans life. The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
are ſuch Indians, as by the cruell and moſt extreame dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Spaniards, haue beene driuen to flie from the maine,
here to releeue and fortifie themſelues. With this people, our
Generall thought it meet to haue traffique, for freſh victuals and
water: and for that cauſe, the very ſame night of our arriuall
there, himſelfe with diuers of his company went aſhoare, to
whom the people with great courteſie came downe, bringing
with them ſuch fruits and other victuals as they had, and two
very fat ſheepe, which they gaue our Generall for a preſent. In
recompence whereof, hee beſtowed vpon them againe many
good and neceſſarie things; ſignifying vnto them, that the end
of his comming was for no other cauſe but by way of exchange,
to traffique with them for ſuch things as wee needed, and they
could ſpare: and in particular, for ſuch as they had alreadie
brought downe vnto vs, beſides freſh water, which wee deſired
of them. Herein they held themſelues well contented, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be not a little ioyful of our comming: appointing where

            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Nou. </seg>26</label> The next day therefore very early in the morning (all things

repaired to the ſhoare againe; and ſetting aland two of
his men, ſent them with their <hi>Barricoes</hi> to the watering place, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
the night before. Who hauing peaceably paſt on one
halfe of the way, were then with no ſmall violence ſet vpon by
thoſe traiterous people, and ſuddenly ſlaine: And to the end that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:5654:29"/>
our Generall with the reſt of his company ſhould not onely be
ſtayed from reſcuing them, but alſo might fall (if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
into their hands in like manner, they had layed cloſely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind

men, armed and well appointed for ſuch a miſchiefe. Who ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
attempting their purpoſe (the rocks being very dangerous
for the boate, and the ſea-gate exceeding great) by ſhooting
their arrowes hurt and wounded euery one of our men, before
they could free themſelues, or come to die vſe of there weapons
to do any good. The General himſelf was ſhot in the face, vnder
his right eye, and cloſe by his noſe, the arrow piercing a maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
way in, vnder <hi>baſis cerebri,</hi> with no ſmall danger of his life;
beſides that, he was grieuouſly wounded in the head. The reſt,
being nine perſons in the boate, were deadly wounded in diuers
parts of their bodies, if God almoſt miraculouſly had not giuen
cure to the ſame. For our chiefe Surgeon being dead, and the
other abſent by the loſſe of our vice-admirall, and hauing none
left vs but a boy, whoſe good will was more then any skill hee
had, we were little better then altogether deſtitute of ſuch cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and helpes as ſo grieuous a ſtate of ſo many wounded bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
did require. Notwithſtanding God, by the good aduice of
our Generall, and the diligent putting too of euery mans helpe,
did giue ſuch ſpeedy and wonderfull cure, that we had all great
comfort thereby, and yeelded God the glory thereof.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of this force and iniurie by theſe Ilanders, was no
other but the deadly hatred which they beare againſt their cruell
enemies the Spaniards, for the bloudy and moſt tirannous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
which they had vſed towards them. And therefore with
purpoſe againſt them (ſuſpecting vs to bee Spaniards indeed,
and that the rather, by occaſion that though command was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to the contrary, ſome of our men in demanding water, vſed
the Spaniſh word <hi>Aqua</hi>)ſought ſome part of reuenge againſt vs.</p>
            <p>Our Generall notwithſtanding he might haue reuenged this
wrong; with little hazard or danger; yet being more deſirous to
preſerue one of his owne men aliue, then to deſtroy 100. of his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:5654:29"/>
enemies, committed the ſame to God: wiſhing this onely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
to them, that they did but know whom they had
wronged, and that they had done this iniurie not to an enemie,
but to a friend, not to a Spaniard, but to an Engliſhman; who
would rather haue beene a patron to defend them, then any
way an inſtrument of the leaſt wrong that ſhould haue beene
done vnto them. The weapons which this people vſe in their
warres, are arrowes of reeds, with heads of ſtone, very brittle and
indented<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but darts of a great length, headed with iron or bone.</p>
            <p>The ſame day that we receiued this dangerous affront, in the
afternoone we ſet ſayle from thence; and becauſe we were now
nigh the appointed height, wherein our ſhips were to be looked
for, as alſo the extremity and craſie ſtate of our hurt men adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
vs to vſe expedition, to finde ſone conuenient place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
which might afford them ſome reſt, and yeeld vs neceſſary
ſupply of freſh victuals for their diet; we bent our courſe, as the

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Nou. </seg>30</label> Where
falling with a bay, called <hi>Philips Bay,</hi> in, 32. deg. or thereabout,
Nouemb. 30. we came to anchor: and foorthwith manned and

to affoord vs ſuch things as we ſtood in need of.</p>
            <p>Our boate doing her vttermoſt endeuour in a diligent ſearch,
yet after long trauell could find no appearance of hope for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
either of freſh victuals or of freſh water: huge heards of
wild buffes they might diſecrne, but not ſo much as any ſigne of
any inhabitant thereabout. Yet in their returne to vs, they deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried
within the bay, an Indian with his Canow as he was a fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
him they brought aboard our generall, canow and all as he
was in it. A comely perſonage, and of a goodly ſtature; his appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
was a white garment, reaching ſcarcely to his knees, his
armes and legges were naked; his haire vpon his head verie long;
without a beard, as all the Indians for the moſt part are. He ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
verie gentle, of mild and humble nature, being verie tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to learne the vſe of euery thing, and moſt gratefull for ſuch
things as our Generall beſtowed vpon him. In him we might ſee
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:5654:30"/>
a moſt liuely patterne of the harmeleſſe diſpoſition of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and how grieuous a thing it is that they ſhould by any
meanes be ſo abuſed as all thoſe are, whom the Spaniards haue
any command or power ouer.</p>
            <p>This man being courteouſly entertained, and his paines of
comming double required; after we had ſhewed him, partly by
ſignes, and partly by ſuch things as we had, what things we nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and would gladly receiue by his meanes, vpon exchange
of ſuch things as he would deſire; wee ſent him away with our
boate and his owne canow (which was made of reed ſtraw) to
land him where he would. Who being landed, and willing our
men to ſtay his returne, was immediatly met with by two or three
of his friends; to whom imparting his newes, and ſhewing what
gifts he had receiued, he gaue ſo great content, that they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
furthered his purpoſe; ſo that, after certaine houres of our
mens abode there, hee with diuers others (among whom was
their head or Captaine) made their returne; bringing with them
their loadings of ſuch things as they thought would do vs good:
as ſome hennes, egges, a fat hogge, and ſuch like. All which
(that our men might be without all ſuſpition of all euill to be
meant or intended by them) they ſent in one of their canowes,
a reaſonable diſtance from off the ſhoare, to our boate, the ſea-gate
being at that preſent very great, and their Captaine hauing
ſent backe his horſe, would needs commit himſelfe to the credit
of our men, though ſtrangers, and come with them to our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
without any of his owne acquaintance or countriemen
with him.</p>
            <p>By his comming as we vnderſtood, that there was no meane

himſelfe to be our pilote, to a place and that a good harbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,
not farre backe to the Southward againe: where, by
way of traffique, we might haue at pleaſure, both water, and
thoſe other things which we ſtood in need of. This offer our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
very gladly receiued, and ſo much the rather, for that the
place intended, was neere about the place appointed, for the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:5654:30"/>
randenoues of our fleete. Omitting therefore our purpoſe, of
purſuing the buffes formerly ſpoken of, of which we had other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
determined, if poſſible to haue killed ſome; this good
newes of better prouiſion, and more eaſie to come by, drew vs
away: and ſo the 5. day after our arriuall, viz. <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Decem. </seg>4</label> December 4. we
departed hence, and the next day <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Decemb. </seg>5</label> December 5. by the willing
conduct of our new Indian Pilote, we came to anchor in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired

            <p>This harbor the Spaniards call <hi>valperizo,</hi> and the towne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning

where albeit we neither met with our ſhips, not heard of them,
yet there was no good thing which the place afforded, or which
our neceſſities indeed for the preſent required, but we had the
ſame in great abundance: amongſt other things we found in
the towne diuerſe ſtorehouſes of the wines of <hi>Chilie;</hi> and in
the harbour, a ſhip called the <hi>Captaine of Moriall, or the grand
Captaine of the South, Admirall to the Ilands of Salomon;</hi> loaden
for the moſt part, with the ſame kinde of liquors: onely there
was beſides, a certaine quantity of fine gold of Baldiuia and a
great croſſe of gold beſet with Emeranlds, on which was nailed
a God of the ſame mettall, wee ſpent ſome time in refreſhing
our ſelues, and eaſing this ſhip of ſo heauy a burthen: and on
the 8. day of the ſame moneth (hauing in the meane time, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
ſtored our ſelues with neceſſaries, as wine, bread, bacon
&amp;c. for along ſeaſon) we ſet ſaile, returning backe towards the
line; carrying againe our Indian pilote with vs, whom our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
bountifully rewarded, and enriched with many good
things, which pleaſed him exceedingly, and cauſed him, by the
way, to be landed in the place where he deſired.</p>
            <p>Our neceſſities being thus to our content releeued, our next
care was the regaining (if poſſible) of the company of our ſhips,
ſo long ſeuered from vs: neither would any thing haue ſatisfied
bur generall, or vs ſo well, as the happy meeting, or good newes

ſet apart) were all our ſtudies and endeauours bent, how to fit it
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:5654:31"/>
ſo, as that no opportunity of meeting them might be paſſed
ouer.</p>
            <p>To this end, conſidering that we could not conueniently
runne in with our ſhip (in ſearch of them) to euery place, where
was likelihood of being a harbour; and that our boate was too
little, and vnable to carry men enough, to encounter the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
or treachery of the Spaniards (if we ſhould by any chance
meete with any of them) who are vſed to ſhew no mercy, where
they may ouermaſter; and therefore meaning not to hazard
our ſelues to their cruell courteſie; we determined, as we coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
now towards the line, to ſearch diligently for ſome conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
place, where we might, in peace and ſafety, ſtay the trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of our ſhip, and the erecting of a pinnace, in which wee
might with better ſecurity, then in our boate, and without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering
of our ſhip, by running into each creeke, leaue no
place vntried, if happily we might ſo finde againe our friends
and countrimen.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe December 19.<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Dec. </seg>19</label> we entred a bay, not farre to
the Southward of the towne of Cyppo now inhabited by the
Spaniards, in 29. deg 30. min. where hauing landed certaine of
our men, to the number of 14. to ſearch what conueniency
the place was likely to afford, for our abiding there; we were
immediatly deſcried by the Spaniards, of the towne of Cyppo,
aforeſayd, who ſpeedily made out 300. men at leaſt wherof 100.
were Spaniards, euery one well mounted vpon his horſe; the
reſt were Indians, running as dogs, at their heeles, all naked,
and in moſt miſerable bondage.</p>
            <p>They could not come any way ſo cloſely, but God did open
our eyes to ſee them, before there was any extremity of danger,
whereby our men being warned, had reaſonable time to ſhift
themſelues as they could; firſt from the maine, to a rocke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

to receiue them, conueighed them with expedition, out of the

his owne ſafety, would not be intreated by his friends, nor fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the multitude of his enemies, to take the preſent benefit
of his owne deliuery: but choſe either to make 300. me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brauing
of them to become afraide, or elſe himſelfe to die in
the place; the latter of which indeed he did, whoſe dead body
being drawne by the Indians from the rocke to the ſhoare, was
there manfully by the Spaniards beheaded, the right hand cut
off, the heart pluct out, all which they carried away in our ſight,
and for the reſt of his carcaſe, they cauſed the Indians to
ſhoote it full of arrowes, made but the ſame day, of greene
wood, and ſo left it to be deuoured of the beaſtes and foules
but that we went aſhoare againe and buried it: wherein as
there appeareth a moſt extreame and barbarous cruelty, ſo doth
it declare to the world, in what miſerable feare the Spaniard
holdeth the gouernment of thoſe parts; liuing in continuall
dread of forreigne inuaſion by ſtrangers, or ſecret cutting of their
throats, by thoſe whom they kept vnder them in ſo ſhamefull
ſlauery, I meane the innocent and harmeleſſe Indians. And
therefore they make ſure to murther what ſtrangers ſoeuer they
can come by, and ſuffer the Indians by no meanes to haue any
weapon longer then they be in preſent ſeruice: as appeared by
their arrowes cut from the tree the ſame day, as alſo by the

            <p>In this place we ſpent ſome time in trimming of our ſhip, and

whom, our generall hauing now fitted all things to his mind, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
(leauing his ſhip the meane while at anchor in the bay)

22. was an Iland ſtanding in the ſame height, with the North
cape of the prouince of Mormorena, at this Iland we found 4.
Indians with their canowes, which tooke vpon them to bring
our men to a place of freſh water, on the foreſayd cape; in hope
whereof, our generall made them great cheere (as his manner
was towards all ſtrangers) and ſet his courſe by their direction,
but when we came vnto the place, and had trauelled vp a long
way into the land, wee found freſh water indeed, but ſcarce ſo
much as they had drunke wine in their paſſage thither.</p>
            <p>As we ſayled along, continually ſearching for freſh water;
we came to a place called Tarapaca, and landing there we ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on a Spaniard who lay aſleepe, and had lying by him 13.
barres of ſiluer, waighing in all, about 4000. Spaniſh duccatts:
we would not (could wee haue choſen) haue awaked him of his
nappe: but ſeeing we, againſt our wills, did him that iniury, we
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:5654:32"/>
freed him of his charge, which otherwiſe perhaps would haue
kept him waking, and ſo left him to take out (if it pleaſed him)
the other part of his ſleepe, in more ſecurity.</p>
            <p>Our ſearch for water ſtill continuing, as we landed againe
not farre from thence, we met a Spaniard with an Indian boy,
driuing 8. Lambes or Peruvian ſheepe: each ſheepe bare two
leathren bagges, and in each bagge was 50. pound waight of
refined ſiluer, in the whole 800. waight: we could not indure
to ſee a gentleman Spaniard turnd carrier ſo; and therefore
without intreaty, we offered our ſeruice, and became drouers:
onely his directions were not ſo perfect, that we could keepe the
way which hee intended; for almoſt as ſoone as hee was parted
from vs, we with our new kinde of carriges, were come vnto
our boates.</p>
            <p>Farther beyond this cape fore-mentioned lie certaine Indian
towns, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence as we paſſed by, came many of the people in
certaine bawſes made of Seales skins; of which two being ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
together of a iuſt length, and ſide by ſide, reſemble in faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or forme a boate: they haue in either of them a ſmall gutt,
or ſome ſuch thing blowne full of winde; by reaſon whereof it
floateth, and is rowed very ſwiftly, carrying in it no ſmall bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.
In theſe vpon ſight of our ſhip, they brought ſtore of fiſh
of diuerſe ſortes, to traffique with vs, for any trifles wee would
giue them: as kniues, margarites, glaſſes, and ſuch like, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
men of 60. &amp; 70. yeares old, were as glad as if they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
ſome exceeding rich commodity; being a moſt ſimple and
plaine dealing people. Their reſort vnto vs was ſuch, as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the ſhortneſſe of the time, was wonderfull to vs to
behold.</p>
            <p>Not farre from this, viz. in 22. deg. 30. min. lay Mormorena,
another great towne of the ſame people, ouer whom 2. Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
held the gouerment, with theſe our generall thought meet
to deale; or at leaſt to try their courteſy, whether they would, in
way of traffique, giue vs ſuch things as we needed or no, and
therefore <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ian. </seg>26</label> Ian. the 26. we caſt anchor here, we found them (more
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:5654:33"/>
for feare then for loue) ſomewhat tractable, and receiued from
them by exchange many good things, very neceſſarie for our
vſes.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other things which we had of them, the ſheepe of
the countrey (viz. ſuch as we mentioned before bearing the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
bags) were moſt memorable. Their height and length
was equall to a pretty cow, and their ſtrength fully anſwerable,
if not by much exceeding their ſize or ſtature. Vpon one of their
backes did ſit at one time three well growne and tall men, and
one boy, no mans foot touching the ground by a large foot in
length, the beaſt nothing at all complaining of his burthen in
the meane time. Theſe ſheepe haue neckes like camels; their
heads bearing a reaſonable reſemblance of another ſheepe. The
Spaniards vſe them to great profit. Their wooll is exceeding
fine, their fleſh good meate, their increaſe ordinarie, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
they ſupply the roome of horſes for burthen or trauell: yea
they ſerue to carry, ouer the mountaines, maruellous loades, for
300. leagues together, where no other carriage can be made but
by them onely. Hereabout, as alſo all along, and vp into the
countrey throughout the Prouince of Cusko, the common
ground whereſoeuer it bee taken vp, in euery hundred pound
weight of earth, yeeldeth 25. s. of pure ſiluer, after the rate of a
crowne an ounce.</p>
            <p>The next place likely to affoord vs any newes of our ſhips
(for in all this way from the height where wee builded our pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
there was no bay or harbour at all for ſhipping) was the
port of the towne of Arica, ſtanding in 20. deg. whither we arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the 7. of February <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Feb. </seg>7</label>: This towne ſeemed to vs to ſtand in the
moſt fruitfull ſoile that we ſaw all alongſt theſe coaſts: both for
that it is ſituate in the mouth of a moſt pleaſant and fertile vally,
abounding with all good things; as alſo in that it hath continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
trade of ſhipping, as well from Lyma as from all other parts
of Peru. It is inhabited by the Spaniards. In two barks here, we
found ſome forty and odde barres of ſiluer (of the bigneſſe and
faſhion of a brickbatte, and in waight each of them about 20.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:5654:33"/>
pounds) of which wee tooke the burthen on our ſelues to eaſe
them, and ſo departed towards Chowley; with which wee fell
the ſecond day following,<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Feb. </seg>9</label> viz. Febr. 9. and in our way to <hi>Lima,</hi>
we met with another barke at <hi>Ariquipa,</hi> which had begun to
loade ſome ſiluer and gold, but hauing had (as it ſeemed from
Arica by land) ſome notice of our coming, had vnloaden the
ſame againe before our arriuall. Yet in this our paſſage we met
another barke loaden with linnen: ſome of which we thought
might ſtand vs in ſome ſtead, and therefore tooke it with vs.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Feb. </seg>15</label> At Lima we arriued Febr. 15. and notwithſtanding the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
forces, though they had thirtie ſhips at that preſent in
harbour there, whereof 17. (moſt of them the eſpeciall ſhips in
all the South ſea) were fully ready, we entred and anchored all
night in the middeſt of them, in the Calao: and might haue
made more ſpoile amongſt them in few houres if we had beene
affected to reuenge, then the Spaniard could haue recouered
againe in many yeares. But wee had more care to get vp that
company which we had ſo long miſt, then to recompence their
cruell and hard dealing by an euen requitall, which now wee
might haue tooke. This Lima ſtands in 12. deg. 30. min. South
latitude.</p>
            <p>Here albeit no good newes of our ſhips could bee had, yet
got we the newes of ſome things that ſeemed to comfort, if not
to counteruaile our trauells thither, as namely, that in the ſhip
of one <hi>Mighell Angell</hi> there, there were 1500. barres of plate,
beſides ſome other things (as ſilkes, linnen, and in one a cheſt
full of royals of plate) which might ſtand vs in ſome ſtead in the
other ſhips; aboard whom we made ſomewhat bold to bid our ſelues
welcome. Here alſo we heard the report of ſome things
that had befallen in &amp; neere Europe, ſince our departure thence;
In particular of the death of ſome great perſonages: as, the king
of Portugall, and both the kings of Morocco and Feſſe, dead all
three in one day at one battell: The death of the king of France,
and the Pope of Rome: Whoſe abhominations as they are in
part cut off from ſome Chriſtian kingdomes, where his ſhame
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:5654:34"/>
is manifeſt, ſo do his vaſſals and accurſed inſtruments labour by
all meanes poſſible to repaire that loſſe, by ſpreading the ſame
the further in theſe parts, where his diuelliſh illuſions and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
deceiuings are not knowne. And as his doctrine takes place
any where, ſo do the manners that neceſſarily accompanie the
ſame infinuate themſelues together with the doctrine. For as its
true that in all the parts of America, where the Spaniards haue
any gouernment, the poiſonous infection of Popery hath ſpread
it ſelfe; ſo on the other ſide it is as true, that there is no Citie, as
Lima, Panama, Mexico, &amp;c. no towne or village, yea no houſe
almoſt in all theſe Prouinces, wherein (amongſt other the like
Spaniſh vertues) not onely whoredome, but the filthineſſe of
Sodome, not to bee named among Chriſtians, is not common
without reproofe: the Popes pardons being more rife in theſe
parts then they be in any part of Europe, for theſe filthineſſes
whereout he ſucketh no ſmall aduantage. Notwithſtanding the
Indians, who are nothing neerer the true knowledge of God
then they were afore, abhorre this moſt filthie and loathſome
manner of liuing; Shewing themſelues in reſpect of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
as the Scythians did in reſpect of the Grecians: who in their
barbarous ignorance, yet in life and behauiour, did ſo farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
the wiſe and learned Greekes, as they were ſhort of them in
the gifts of learning and knowledge.</p>
            <p>But as the Pope and Antichriſtian Biſhops labour by their
wicked factors with tooth and naile to deface the glory of God,
and to ſhut vp in darkneſſe the light of the Goſpell; ſo God doth
not ſuffer his name and Religion to be altogether without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
to the reprouing both of his falſe and damnable doctrine,
as alſo crying out againſt his vnmeaſurable and abhominable li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouneſſe
of the fleſh, euen in theſe parts. For in this City of
Lima, not two monethes before our comming thither, there
were certaine perſons, to the number of twelue apprehended,
examined, and condemned for the profeſſion of the Goſpell,
and reproouing the doctrines of men, with the filthie manners
vſed in that City: Of which twelue, ſixe were bound to one ſtake
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:5654:34"/>
and burnt, the reſt remained yet in priſon, to drinke of the ſame
cup within few dayes. Laſtly, here we had intelligence of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
rich ſhip, which was loaden with gold and ſiluer for Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,
that had ſet forth of this hauen the ſecond of February.</p>
            <p>The very next day therefore in the morning (viz. the 16. of

loaden.</p>
            <p>This ſhip we found to bee the ſame of which we had heard,

afterward (which now we are at leaſure to relate, viz. by a ſhip
which we tooke betweene Lima and Paita: by another which
we took loaden with wine in the port of Paita: by a third loaden
with tackling and implements for ſhips (beſides eightie pound

the like trifles, valued in all at about 360000. pezoes. We gaue
the maſter a little linnen and the like, for theſe commodities;
and at the end of ſixe dayes we bad farewell and parted. Hee
haſtening ſomewhat lighter then before to Panama, we ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off to ſea, that we might with more leaſure conſider what

            <p>And conſidering that now we were come to the Northward
of the line (<hi>Cape Franciſco</hi> ſtanding in the entrance of the bay of

the time of the yeare now drew on, wherein we muſt attempt, or
of neceſſitie wholly giue ouer that action which chiefly our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall

diſcouered, and made knowne to be nauigable, we ſhould not
onely do our countrie a good and notable ſeruice, but we alſo
our ſelues, ſhould haue a neerer cut and paſſage home: where
otherwiſe, we were to make a very long and tedious voyage of it,
which would hardly agree with our good liking, we hauing
beene ſo long from home already, and ſo much of our ſtrength

500. leagues in longitude, to gee a winde: and betweene that

North latitude, where in the night following, we found ſuch
alteration of heate, into extreame and nipping cold, that our
men in generall, did grieuouſly complaine thereof; ſome of
them feeling their healths much impaired thereby, neither was
it, that this chanced in the night alone, but the day following
carried with it, not onely the markes, but the ſtings and force of
the night going before; to the great admiration of vs all, for
beſides that the pinching and biting aire, was nothing altered;
the very roapes of our ſhip were ſtiffe, and the raine which fell,

            <p>Neither did this happen for the time onely, or by ſome ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

not, for it came to that extremity, in ſayling but 2. deg. farther

whether their hands ſhould feed their mouthes, or rather keepe
themſelues within their couerts, from the pinching cold that
did benumme them. Neither could we impute it to the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

of heate, by reaſon whereof we might be more ſenſible of the
preſent cold: inſomuch as the dead and ſenceleſſe creatures,
were as well affected with it as our ſelues, our meate as ſoone
as it was remooued from the fire, would preſently in a manner

he ſo ſtirred them vp, to put on a good courage, and to
quite themſelues like men, to indure ſome ſhort extremity, to
haue the ſpeedier comfort, and a little trouble, to obtaine the
greater glory; that euery man was throughly armed with wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe,
and reſolued to ſee the vttermoſt, if it were poſſible, of
what good was to be done that way.</p>
            <p>The land in that part of America, bearing farther out into
the Weſt, then we before imagined, we were neerer on it then
wee were aware; and yet the neerer ſtill wee came vnto it, the
more extremitie of cold did ſeaſe vpon vs.<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Iune </seg>5</label> The 5. day of Iune,
wee were forced by contrary windes, to run in with the ſhoare,
which we then firſt deſcried; and to caſt anchor in a bad bay,
the beſt roade we could for the preſent meete with: where wee
were not without ſome danger, by reaſon of the many extreme
guſts, and flawes that beate vpon vs; which if they ceaſed and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:5654:37"/>
were ſtill at any time, immediatly vpon their intermiſſion, there
followed moſt vile, thicke, and ſtinking fogges; againſt which
the ſea preuailed nothing, till the guſts of wind againe remoued
them, which brought with them, ſuch extremity and violence
when they came, that there was no dealing or reſiſting againſt
them.</p>
            <p>In this place was no abiding for vs; and to go further North,
the extremity of the cold (which had now vtterly diſcouraged
our men) would not permit vs: and the winds directly bent
againſt vs, hauing once gotten vs vnder ſayle againe, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vs to the Southward whether we would or no.</p>
            <p>From the height of 48. deg. in which now we were, to 38. we
found the land by coaſting alongſt it to bee but low and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
plaine: euery hill (whereof we ſaw many, but none verie
high) though it were in Iune, and the Sunne in his neereſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch
vnto them being couered with ſnow.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Iune </seg>17</label> In 38 deg. 30. min. we fell with a conuenient and fit harbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,
and Iune 17. came to anchor therein: where we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
till the 23. day of Iuly following. During all which time,
notwithſtanding it was in the height of Summer, and ſo neere
the Sunne; yet were wee continually viſited with like nipping
colds, as we had felt before: inſomuch that if violent exerciſes
of our bodies, and buſie imployment about our neceſſarie la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
had not ſometimes compeld vs to the contrary, we could
very well haue beene contented to haue kept about vs ſtill our
Winter clothes; yea (had our neceſſities ſuffered vs) to haue
kept our beds; neither could we at any time in whole fourteene
dayes together, find the aire ſo cleare as to be able to take the
height of Sunne or ſtarre.</p>
            <p>And here hauing ſo fit occaſion,(notwithſtanding it may
ſeeme to be beſides the purpoſe of writing the hiſtory of this our
voyage) we will a little more diligently inquire into the cauſes
of the continuance of the extreame cold in theſe parts: as alſo
into the probabilities or vnlikelihoods of a paſſage to be found
that way. Neither was it (as hath formerly beene touched) the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:5654:37"/>
tenderneſſe of our bodies, comming ſo lately out of the heate,
whereby the poores were opened, that made vs ſo ſenſible of the
colds we here felt: in this reſpect, as in many others, we found
our God a prouident father, and carefull Phyſitian for vs. We
lacked no outward helpes nor inward comforts, to reſtore and
fortifie nature, had it beene decayed or weakened in vs; neither
was there wanting to vs the great experience of our Generall,
who had often himſelfe proued the force of the burning Zone;
whoſe aduice alwayes preuailed much to the preſeruing of a
moderate temper in our conſtitutions: ſo that euen after our
departure from the heate wee alwayes found our bodies not as
ſponges, but ſtrong and hardned, more able to beare out cold,
though we came out of exceſſe of heate, then a number of cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
champions could haue beene, who lye on their feather-beds
till they go to ſea, or rather whoſe teeth in a temperate aire do
beate in their heads, at a cup of cold Sack and ſugar by the fire.</p>
            <p>And that it was not our tendernes, but the very extremitie of
the cold it ſelfe, that cauſed this ſenſiblenes in vs, may the rather
appeare in that the naturall inhabitants of the place (with whom
we had for a long ſeaſon familiar intercourſe, as is to be related)
who had neuer beene acquainted with ſuch heate; to whom the
countrey, ayre, and climate was proper; and in whom cuſtome
of cold was as it were a ſecond nature: yet vſed to come ſhiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to vs in their warme furres; crowding cloſe together body
to body, to receiue heate one of another, and ſheltring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
vnder a lee bancke, if it were poſſible, and as often as they
could, labouring to ſhroude themſelues vnder our garments al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
to keepe them warme. Beſides how vnhandſome and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
appeared the face of the earth it ſelfe ſhewing trees with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
leaues, and the ground without greennes in thoſe moneths
of Iune and Iuly. The poore birds and foules not daring (as we
had great experience to obſerue it) not daring ſo much as once
to ariſe from their neſts, after the firſt egge layed, till it with all
the reſt be hatched, and brought to ſome ſtrength of nature, able
to helpe it ſelfe. Onely this recompence hath nature affoorded
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:5654:38"/>
them, that the heate of their owne bodies being exceeding great,
it perfecteth the creature with greater expedition, and in ſhorter
time then is to be found in many other places.</p>
            <p>As for the cauſes of this extremity they ſeeme not to be ſo
deeply hidden, but that they may at leaſt in part be gueſſed at:
The chiefeſt of which we conceiue to be the large ſpreading of
the Aſian and American continent, which (ſomewhat North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of theſe parts) if they be not fully ioyned, yet ſeeme they
to come very neere one to the other. From whoſe high and
ſnow-couered mountaines, the North and North-weſt winds
(the conſtant viſitants of thoſe coaſts) ſend abroad their frozen
nimphes, to the infecting of the whole aire with this inſuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſharpneſſe: not permitting the Sunne, no not in the pride
of his heate, to diſſolue that congealed matter and ſnow, which
they haue breathed out ſo nigh the Sunne, and ſo many degrees
diſtant from themſelues. And that the North and North-weſt
winds are here conſtant in Iune and Iuly, as the North wind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is in Auguſt and September; we not onely found it by our
owne experience, but were fully confirmed in the opinion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
by the continued obſeruations of the Spaniards. Hence
comes the generall ſqualidneſſe and barrenneſſe of the countrie;
hence comes it, that in the middeſt of their Summer, the ſnow
hardly departeth euen from their very doores, but is neuer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away from their hils at all; hence come thoſe thicke miſts
and moſt ſtinking fogges, which increaſe ſo much the more, by
how much higher the pole is raiſed: wherein a blind pilot is as
good as the beſt director of a courſe. For the Sunne ſtriuing to
performe his naturall office, in eleuating the vapours out of theſe
inferior bodies; draweth neceſſarily abundance of moiſture out
of the ſea: bat the nipping cold (from the former cauſes) mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and oppoſing the Sunnes indeuour, forces him to giue ouer
his worke imperfect: and inſtead of higher eleuation, to leaue in
the loweſt region, wandring vpon the face of the earth and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as it were a ſecond ſea: through which its owne beames can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
poſſibly pierce, vnleſſe ſometimes when the ſudden violence
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:5654:38"/>
of the winds doth helpe to ſcatter and breake through it; which
thing happeneth very ſeldome, and when it happeneth is of no
continuance. Some of our marriners in this voyage had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beene at Wardhouſe, in 72. deg. of North latitude; who yet
affirmed, that they felt no ſuch nipping cold there in the end of
Summer, when they departed thence, as they did here in thoſe
hotteſt moneths of Iune and Iuly.</p>
            <p>And alſo from theſe reaſons we coniecture; that either there
is no paſſage at all through theſe Northerne coaſts (which is
moſt likely) or if there be, that yet it is vnnauigable. Adde here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
that though we ſearched the coaſt diligently, euen vnto
the 48. deg. yet found we not the land, to trend ſo much as one
point in any place towards the Eaſt, but rather running on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
Northweſt, as if it went directly to meet with Aſia; and
euen in that height when we had a franke wind, to haue carried
vs through, had there beene a paſſage, yet we had a ſmooth and
calme ſea, with ordinary flowing and reflowing, which could
not haue beene, had there beene a frete: of which we rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
concluded then coniectured, that there was none. But to
returne.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Iune </seg>18</label> The next day after our comming to anchor in the aforeſaid har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
the people of the countrey ſhewed themſelues; ſending
off a man with great expedition to vs in a canow. Who being
yet but a little from the ſhoare, and a great way from our ſhip,
ſpake to vs continually as he came rowing on. And at laſt at a
reaſonable diſtance ſtaying himſelfe, he began more ſolemnely
a long and tedious oration, after his manner: vſing in the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
thereof, many geſtures and ſignes; mouing his hands, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his head and body many wayes; and after his oration en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
with great ſhew of reuerence and ſubmiſſion, returned back
to ſhoare againe. He ſhortly came againe the ſecond time in like
manner, and ſo the third time: When he brought with him (as a
preſent from the reſt) a bunch of feathers, much like the feathers
of a blacke crow, very neatly and artificially gathered vpon a
ſtring, and drawne together into a round bundle, being verie
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:5654:39"/>
cleane and finely cut, and bearing in length an equall proportion
one with another; a ſpeciall cognizance (as wee afterwards ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued)
which they that guard their kings perſon, weare on their
heads. With this alſo he brought a little basket made of ruſhes,
and filled with an herbe which they called <hi>Tabáh.</hi> Both which
being tyed to a ſhort rodde, he caſt into our boate. Our Generall
intended to haue recompenced him immediatly with many
good things, he would haue beſtowed vpon him: but entring
into the boate to deliuer the ſame, he could not be drawne to
receiue them by any meanes: ſaue one hat, which being caſt into
the water out of the ſhip, he tooke vp (refuſing vtterly to meddle
with any other thing, though it were vpon a board put off vnto
him) and ſo preſently made his returne. After which time, our
boate could row no way, but wondring at vs as at gods, they
would follow, the ſame with admiration.</p>
            <p>The 3. day following, viz. <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ian. </seg>21</label> the 21. our ſhip hauing receiued
a leake at ſea, waſ brought to-anchor neerer the ſhoare, that
her goods being landed, ſhe might be repaired: but for that
we were to preuent any danger, that might chance againſt our
ſafety, our generall firſt of all landed his men, with all neceſſary
prouiſion, to build tents and make a fort for the defence of our
ſelues and goods: and that wee might vnder the ſhelter of it,
with more ſafety (what euer ſhould befall) end our buſinſſe;
which when the people of the country perceiued vs doing, as
men ſet on fire to war, in defence of their countrie, in great haſt
and companies, with ſuch weapons as they had, they came
downe vnto vs; and yet with no hoſtile meaning, or intent to
hurt vs: ſtanding when they drew neere, as men rauiſhed in
their mindes, with the ſight of ſuch things as they neuer had
ſeene, or heard of before that time: their errand being rather
with ſubmiſſion and feare to worſhip vs as Gods, then to haue
any warre with vs as with mortall men. Which thing as it did
partly ſhew it ſelfe at that inſtant, ſo did it more and more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
it ſelfe afterwards, during the whole time of our abode
amongſt them. At this time, being willed by ſignes to lay from
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:5654:39"/>
them their bowes and arrowes, they did as they were directed,
and ſo did all the reſt, as they came more and more by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
vnto them, growing in a little while, to a great number
both of men and women.</p>
            <p>To the intent therefore, that this peace which they themſelues
ſo willingly ſought, might without any cauſe of the breach
thereof, on our part giuen, be continued; and that wee might
with more ſafety and expedition, end our buſineſſes in quiet;
our Generall with all his company, vſed all meanes poſſible,
gently to intreate them, beſtowing vpon each of them liberally,
good and neceſſary things to couer their nakedneſſe, withall ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
vnto them, we were no Gods but men, and had neede
of ſuch things to couer our owne ſhame; teaching them to vſe
them to the ſame ends: for which cauſe alſo wee did eate and
drinke in their preſence, giuing them to vnderſtand, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that wee could not liue, and therefore were but men as
well as they.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding nothing could perſwade them, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue
that opinion, which they had conceiued of vs, that wee
ſhould be Gods.</p>
            <p>In recompence of thoſe things which they had receiued of vs,
as ſhirts linnen cloth, &amp;c. they beſtowed vpon our generall, and
diuerſe of our company, diuerſe things, as feathers, cawles of
networke, the quiuers of their arrowes, made of fawne-skins,
and the very skins of beaſts that their women wore vpon their
bodies. Hauing thus had their fill of this times viſiting and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
of vs, they departed with ioy to their houſes, which
houſes are digged round within the earth, and haue from the
vppermoſt brimmes of the circle, clefts of wood ſet vp, and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
cloſe together at the top, like our ſpires on the ſteeple of a
Church: which being couered with earth, ſuffer no water to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and are very warme, the doore in the moſt part of them,
performes the office alſo of a chimney, to let out the ſmoake:
its made in bigneſſe and faſhion, like to an ordinary ſcuttle in a
ſhip, and ſtanding ſlopewiſe: their beds are the hard ground,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:5654:40"/>
onely with ruſhes ſtrewed vpon it, and lying round about the
houſe, haue their fire in the middeſt, which by reaſon that the
houſe is but low vaulted, round and cloſe, giueth a maruelous
reflexion to their bodies to heate the ſame.</p>
            <p>Their men for the moſt part goe naked, the women take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
of bulruſhes, and kembing it after the manner of hempe,
make themſelues thereof a looſe garment, which being knitte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their middles, hanges downe about their hippes, and ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordes
to them a couering of that, which nature teaches ſhould
be hidden: about their ſhoulders, they weare alſo the skin of a
deere, with the haire vpon it. They are very obedient to their-husbands,
and exceeding ready in all ſeruices: yet of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
offring to do nothing, without the conſents, or being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
of the men.</p>
            <p>As ſoone as they were returned to their houſes, they began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
themſelues a kind of moſt lamentable weeping &amp; crying
out; which they continued alſo a great while together, in ſuch
ſort, that in the place where they left vs (being neere about 3.
quarters of an Engliſh mile diſtant from them) we very plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
with wonder and admiration did heare the ſame: the women
eſpecially, extending their voices, in a moſt miſerable and dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
manner of ſhreeking.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this humble manner of preſenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
and awfull demeanour vſed towards vs, we thought it
no wiſedowe too farre to truſt them (our experience of former
Infidels dealing with vs before, made vs carefull to prouide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
an alteration of their affections, or breach of peace if it
ſhould happen) and therefore with all expedition we ſet vp our
tents, and entrenched our ſelues with walls of ſtone: that ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fortified within our ſelues, we might be able to keepe off the
enemie (if they ſhould ſo proue) from comming amongſt vs
without our good wills: this being quickly finiſhed we went
the more cheerefully and ſecurely afterward, about our other
buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>Againſt the end of two daies (during which time they had
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:5654:40"/>
not againe beene with vs) there was gathered together a great
aſſembly of men, women, and children (inuited by the report of
them which firſt ſaw vs, who as it ſeemes, had in that time, of
purpoſe diſperſed themſelues into the country, to make knowne
the newes) who came now the ſecond time vnto vs, bringing
with them as before had beene done, feathers and bagges of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bàh</hi>
for preſents, or rather indeed for ſacrifices, vpon this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
that we were Gods.</p>
            <p>When they came to the top of the hill, at the bottome
whereof wee had built our fort, they made a ſtand; where one
(appointed as their chiefe ſpeaker) wearied both vs his hearers,
and himſelfe too, with a long and tedious oration: deliuered
with ſtrange and violent geſtures, his voice being extended to
the vttermoſt ſtrength of nature, and his words falling ſo thicke
one in the neck of another, that he could hardly fetch his breath
againe: as ſoone as he had concluded, all the reſt, with a reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
bowing of their bodies (in a dreaming manner, and long
producing of the ſame) cryed <hi>Oh:</hi> thereby giuing their conſents,
that all was very true which he had ſpoken, and that they had vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
their minde by his mouth vnto vs; which done, the men
laying downe their bowes vpon the hill, and leauing their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and children behinde them, came downe with their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents;
in ſuch ſort, as if they had appeared before a God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed:
thinking themſelues happy, that they might haue acceſſe
vnto our generall, but much more happy, when they ſawe that
he would receiue at their hands, thoſe things which they ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
had preſented: and no doubt, they thought themſelues
neereſt vnto God, when they ſate or ſtood next to him: In the
meane time the women, as if they had beene deſperate, vſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
violence againſt themſelues, crying and ſhreeking pite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
tearing their fleſh with their nailes from their cheekes, in
a monſtrous manner, the blood ſtreaming downe along their
breſts; beſides deſpoiling the vpper parts of their bodies, of
thoſe ſingle couerings they formerly had, and holding their
hands aboue their heads, that they might not reſcue their breſts
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:5654:41"/>
from harme, they would with furie caſt themſelues vpon the
ground, neuer reſpecting whether it were cleane or ſoft, but
daſhed themſelues in this manner on hard ſtones, knobby, hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks,
ſtocks of wood, and pricking buſhes, or what euer elſe lay
in their way, itterating the ſame courſe againe and againe: yea
women great with child, ſome nine or ten times each, and others
holding out till 15. or 16. times (till their ſtrengths failed them)
exerciſed this cruelty againſt themſelues: A thing more grieuous
for vs to ſee, or ſuffer could we haue holpe it, then trouble to
them (as it ſeemed) to do it.</p>
            <p>This bloudie ſacrifie (againſt our wils) being thus perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
our Generall with his companie in the prefence of thoſe
ſtrangers fell to prayers: and by ſignes in lifting vp our eyes and
hands to heauen, ſignified vnto them, that that God whom we
did ſerue, and whom they ought to worſhip, was aboue: Beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
God if it were his good pleaſure to-open by ſome meanes
their blinded eyes; that they might in due time be called to the
knowledge of him the true and euerliuing God, and of Ieſus
Chriſt whom he hath ſent, the ſaluation of the Gentiles. In the
time of which prayers, ſinging of Pſalmes, and reading of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Chapters in the Bible, they ſate very attentiuely: and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing
the end at euery pauſe, with one voice ſtill cryed, Oh,
greatly rejoycing in our exerciſes. Yea they tooke ſuch pleaſure
in our ſinging of Pſalmes, that whenſoeuer they reſorted to vs,
their firſt requeſt was commonly this, <hi>Gnaáh,</hi> by which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
that we would ſing.</p>
            <p>Our General hauing now beſtowed vpon them diuers things,
at their departure they reſtored them all againe; none carrying
with him any thing of whatſoeuer hee had receiued, thinking
themſelues ſufficiently enriched and happie, that they had found
ſo free acceſſe to ſee vs.</p>
            <p>Againſt the end of three daies more (the newes hauing the
while ſpread it ſelf farther, and as it ſeemed a great way vp into
the countrie) were aſſembled the greateſt number of people,
which wee could reaſonably imagine, to dwell within any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:5654:41"/>
diſtance round about. Amongſt the reſt, the king him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
a man of a goodly ſtature and comely perſonage attended
with his guard, of about 100. tall and warlike men, this day, viz.
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Iune </seg>26</label> Iune 26. came downe to ſee vs.</p>
            <p>Before his comming, were ſent two Embaſſadors or meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to our Generall, to ſignifie that their <hi>Hióh,</hi> that is, their king
was coming and at hand. They in the deliuery of their meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
the one ſpake with a ſoft and low voice, prompting his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
the other pronounced the ſame word by word after him,
with a voice more audible: continuing their proclamation (for
ſuch it was) about halfe an houre. Which being ended, they by
ſignes made requeſt to our Generall, to ſend ſomething by their
hands to their <hi>Hióh</hi> or king, as a token that his comming might
be in peace. Our Generall willingly ſatisfied their deſire; and
they, glad men, made ſpeedy returne to their <hi>Hióh:</hi> Neither was
it long before their king (making as princely a ſhew as poſſibly
he could) with all his traine came forward.</p>
            <p>In their coming forwards they cryed continually after a
ſinging manner with a luſtie courage. And as they drew neerer
and neerer towards vs, ſo did they more and more ſtriue to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue
themſelues with a certaine comelineſſe and grauity in all
their actions.</p>
            <p>In the forefront came a man of a large body and goodly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
bearing the Septer or royall mace (made of a certaine kind
of blacke wood, and in length about a yard and a halfe) before
the king. Whereupon hanged two crownes, a bigger and a leſſe,
with three chaines of a maruellous length, and often doubled;
beſides a bagge of the herbe <hi>Tabáh.</hi> The crownes were made of
knitworke, wrought vpon moſt curiouſly with feathers of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
colours, very artificially placed, and of a formall faſhion:
The chaines ſeemed of a bony ſubſtance: euery linke or part
thereof being very little, thinne, moſt finely burniſhed, with a
hole pierced through the middeſt. The number of linkes going
to make one chaine, is in a manner infinite: but of ſuch eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it s amongſt them, that few be the perſons that are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:5654:42"/>
to weare the ſame: and euen they to whom its lawfull to vſe
them, yet are ſtinted what number they ſhall vſe; as ſome ten,
ſome twelue, ſome twentie, and as they exceed in number of
chaines, ſo are they thereby knowne to be the more honorable
perſonages.</p>
            <p>Next vnto him that bare his Scepter, was the king himſelfe
with his guard about him: His attire vpon his head was a cawle
of knitworke, wrought vpon ſomewhat like the crownes, but
differing much both in faſhion and perfectneſſe of worke; vpon
his ſhoulders he had on a coate of the skins of conies, reaching
to his waſt: His guard alſo had each coats of the ſame ſhape, but
of other skins:ſome hauing cawles likewiſe ſtucke with feathers,
or couered ouer with a certaine downe, which groweth vp in
the countrey vpon an herbe much like our lectuce; which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
any other downe in the world for fineneſſe, and beeing
layed vpon their cawles by no winds can be remoued: Of ſuch
eſtimation is this herbe amongſt them, that the downe thereof
is not lawfull to be worne, but of ſuch perſons as are about the
king (to whom alſo it is permitted to weare plume of feathers
on their heads, in ſigne of honour) and the ſeeds are not vſed but
onely in ſacrifice to their gods. After theſe in their order, did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the naked ſort of common people; whoſe haire being long,
was gathered into a bunch behind, in which ſtucke plumes of
feathers, but in the forepart onely ſingle feathers like hornes,
euery one pleaſing himſelfe in his owne deuice.</p>
            <p>This one thing was obſerued to bee generall amongſt them
all; that euery one had his face painted, ſome which white, ſome
blacke, and ſome with other colours, euery man alſo bringing in
his hand one thing or other for a gift or preſent: Their traine or
laſt part of their company conſiſted of women and children,
each woman bearing againſt her breaſt a round basket or two,
hauing within them diuers things, as bagges of <hi>Tobâh,</hi> a roote
which they call <hi>Petáh,</hi> whereof they make a kind of meale, and
either bake it into bread, or eate it raw; broyled fiſhes like a
pilchard; the ſeed and downe aforenamed, with ſuch like:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:5654:42"/>
Their baskets were made in faſhion like a deepe boale, and
though the matter were ruſhes, or ſuch other kind of ſtuffe, yet
was it ſo cunningly handled, that the moſt part of them would
hold water; about the brimmes they were hanged with peeces
of the ſhels of pearles, and in ſome places with two or three
linkes at a place, of the chaines forenamed: thereby ſignifying,
that they were veſſels wholly dedicated to the onely vſe of the
gods they worſhipped: and beſides this, they were wrought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
with the matted downe of red feathers, diſtinguiſhed into
diuers workes and formes.</p>
            <p>In the meane time our Generall hauing aſſembled his men
together (as forecaſting the danger, and worſt that might fall
our) prepared himſelfe to ſtand vpon ſure ground, that wee
might at all times be ready in our owne defence, if any thing
ſhould chance otherwiſe then was looked for or expected.</p>
            <p>Wherefore euery man being in a warlike readineſſe, he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
within his fenced place, making againſt their approach a
moſt warlike ſhew (as he did alſo at all other times of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort)
whereby if they had beene deſperate enemies, they could
not haue choſen but haue conceiued terrour and feare, with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to attempt any thing againſt vs, in beholding of
the ſame.</p>
            <p>When they were come ſomewhat neere vnto vs, trooping
togetehr, they gaue vs a common or a generall ſalutation: ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing
in the meane time a generall ſilence. Whereupon he
who bare the Scepter before the king, being prompted by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
whom the king aſſigned to that office, pronounced with an
audible and manly voice, what the other ſpake to him in ſecret:
continuing, whether it were his oration or proclamation, at the
leaſt halfe an houre. At the cloſe whereof, there was a common
<hi>Amen,</hi> in ſigne of approbation giuen by euery perſon: And the
king himſelfe with the whole number of men and women (the
little children onely remaining behind) came further downe the
hill, and as they came ſet themſelues againe in their former
order.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:5654:43"/>
And being now come to the foot of the hill and neere out
fort, the Scepter bearer with a compoſed countenance and
ſtately carriage began a ſong, and anſwerable thereunto, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
a kind of meaſures in a dance: whom the king with his guard
and euery other ſort of perſon following, did in like manner ſing
and daunce, ſauing onely the women who danced but kept ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
As they danced they ſtill came on: and our Generall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
their plaine and ſimple meaning, gaue order that they
might freely enter without interruption within our bulwarke:
Where after they had entred they yet continued their ſong and
dance a reaſonable time: their women alſo following them with
their waſſaile boales in their hands, their bodies bruiſed, their
faces torne, their dugges, breaſts, and other parts beſpotted with
bloud, trickling downe from the wounds, which with their nailes
they had made before their comming.</p>
            <p>After that they had ſatisfied or rather tired themſelues in this
manner, they made ſignes to our Generall to haue him ſit down;
Vnto whom both the king and diuers others made ſeuerall ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or rather indeed if wee, had vnderſtood them, ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that hee would take the Prouince and kingdome into his
hand, and become their king and patron: making ſignes that
they would reſigne vnto him their right and title in the whole
land, and become his vaſſals in themſelues and their poſterities:
Which that they might make vs indéed beleeue that it was their
true meaning and intent; the king himſelfe with all the reſt with
one conſent, and with great reuerence, ioyfully ſinging a ſong,
ſet the crowne vpon his head; inriched his necke with all their
chaines; and offering vnto him many other things, honoured
him by the name of <hi>Hyóh.</hi> Adding thereunto (as it might ſeeme)
a ſong and dance of triumph: becauſe they were not onely viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the gods (for ſo they ſtill iudged vs to be) but the great and
chiefe god was now become their god, their king and patron,
and themſelues were become the onely happie and bleſſed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in all the World.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being ſo freely offered, our Generall thought
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:5654:43"/>
not meet to reiect or refuſe the ſame: both for that he would
not giue them any cauſe of miſtruſt, or diſliking of him (that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the onely place, wherein at this preſent, we were of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
inforced to ſeeke reliefe of many things) and chiefely, for that
he knew not to what good end God had brought this to paſſe,
or what honour and profit it might bring to our countrie in
time to come.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in the name and to the vſe of her moſt excellent
maieſty, he tooke the ſcepter crowne and dignity, of the ſayd
countrie into his hand; wiſhing nothing more, then that it had
layen ſo fitly for her maieſty to enioy, as it was now her proper
owne, and that the riches and treaſures thereof (wherewith in
the vpland countries it abounds) might with as great conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
be tranſported, to the enriching of her kingdome here at
home, as it is in plenty to be attained there: and eſpecially, that
ſo tractable and louing a people, as they ſhewed themſelues to
be, might haue meanes to haue manifeſted their moſt willing
obedience the more vnto her, and by her meanes, as a mother
and nurſe of the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> might by the preaching of
the Goſpell, be brought to the right knowledge, and obedience
of the true and euerliuing God.</p>
            <p>The ceremonies of this reſigning, and receiuing of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
being thus performed, the common ſort both of men and
women, leauing the king and his guard about him, with our
generall, diſperſed themſelues among our people, taking a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
view or ſuruey of euery man; and finding ſuch as pleaſed
their fancies (which commonly were the youngeſt of vs) they
preſently encloſing them about, offred their ſacrifices vnto
them, crying out with lamentable ſhreekes and moanes, wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
and ſcratching, and tearing their very fleſh off their faces
with their nailes, neither were it the women alone which did
this, but euen old men, roaring and crying out, were as violent
as the women were.</p>
            <p>We groaned in ſpirit to ſee the power of Sathan ſo farre pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile,
in ſeducing theſe ſo harmeleſſe ſoules, and laboured by all
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:5654:44"/>
means, both by ſhewing our great diſlike, and when that ſerued
not, by violent withholding of their hands from that madneſſe,
directing them (by our eyes and hands lift vp towards heauen)
to the liuing God whom they ought to ſerue: but ſo mad were
they vpon their Idolatry, that forcible withholding them wou'd
not preuaile (for as ſoone as they could get liberty to their
hands againe, they would be as violent as they were before) till
ſuch time, as they when they worſhipped, were conueyed from
them into the tents, whom yet as men deſides themſelues, they
would with fury and outrage ſeeke to haue againe.</p>
            <p>After that time had a little qualified their madnes, they then
began to ſhew &amp; make knowne vnto vs their griefes and diſeaſes
which they carried about them, ſome of them hauing old aches,
ſome ſhruncke ſinewes, ſome old ſoares and canckred vlcers,
ſome wounds more lately receiued, and the like, in moſt lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
manner crauing helpe and cure thereof from vs: making
ſignes, that if we did but blowe vpon their griefes, or but tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the diſeaſed places, they would be whole.</p>
            <p>Their griefes we could not but take pitty on them, and to
our power deſire to helpe them: but that (if it pleaſed God to
open their eyes) they might vnderſtand we were but men and
no gods, we vſed ordinary meanes, as lotions, emplaiſters, and
vnguents moſt fitly (as farre as our skills could gueſſe) agreeing
to the natures of their griefes, beſeeching God, if it made for
his glory, to giue cure to their diſeaſes by theſe meanes. The
like we did from time to time as they reſorted to vs.</p>
            <p>Few were the dayes, wherein they were abſent from vs, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the whole time of our abode in that place: and ordinarily
euery third day, they brought their ſacrifices, till ſuch time, as
they certainely vnderſtood our meaning, that we tooke no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
but were diſpleaſed with them: whereupon their zeale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,
and their ſacrificing, for a ſeaſon, to our good liking cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
not-withſtanding they continued ſtill to make their reſort
vnto vs in great abundance, and in ſuch ſort, that they oft-times
forgate, to prouide meate for their owne ſuſtenance; ſo that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:5654:44"/>
our generall (of whom they made account as of a father) was
faine to performe the office of a father to them, relieuing them
with ſuch victualls, as we had prouided for our ſelues, as, Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
Scales, and ſuch like, wherein they tooke exceeding much
content; and ſeeing that their ſacrifices were diſpleaſing to vs,
yet (hating ingratitude) they ſought to recompence vs, with
ſuch things as they had, which they willingly inforced vpon vs,
though it were neuer ſo neceſſarie or needfull for themſelues to
keepe.</p>
            <p>They are a people of a tractable, free, and louing nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
guile or treachery; they bowes and arrowes (their only wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
and almoſt all their wealth) they vſe very skillfully, but yet
not to do any great harme with them, being by reaſon of their
weakeneſſe, more fit for children then for men, ſending the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
neither farre off, nor with any great force: and yet are the
men commonly ſo ſtrong of body, that that, which 2. or 3. of
our men could hardly beare, one of them would take vpon his
backe, and without grudging carrie it eaſily away, vp hill and
downe hill an Engliſh mile together: they are alſo exceeding
ſwift in running, and of long continuance; the vſe whereof is ſo
familiar with them, that they ſeldome goe, but for the moſt
part runne. One thing we obſerued in them with admiration:
that if at any time, they chanced to ſee a fiſh, ſo neere the ſhoare,
that they might reach the place without ſwimming, they would
neuer, or very ſeldome miſſe to take it.</p>
            <p>After that our neceſſary buſineſſes were well diſpatched, our
generall with his gentlemen, and many of his company, made a
journy vp into the land, to ſee the manner of their dwelling,
and to be the better acquainted, with the nature and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the country. Their houſes were all ſuch as wee haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
deſcribed, and being many of them in one place, made
ſeuerall villages here and there. The inland we found to be farre
different from the ſhoare, a goodly country, and fruitfull ſoyle,
ſtored with many bleſſings fit for the vſe of man: infinite was
the company of very large and fat Deere, which there we ſawe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:5654:45"/>
by thouſands, as we ſuppoſed, in a heard: beſides a multitude
of a ſtrange kinde of Conies, by farre exceeding them in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
their heads and bodies, in which they reſemble other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
are but ſmall; his tayle like the tayle of a Rat, exceeding
long;and his feet like the pawes of a Want or Moale; vnder his
chinne, on either ſide, he hath a bagge, into which he gathereth
his meate, when he hath filled his belly abroade, that he may
with it, either feed his young, or feed himſelfe, when he liſts
not to trauaile from his burrough: the people eate their bodies,
and make great account of their skinnes, for their kings holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies
coate was made of them.</p>
            <p>This country our generall named <hi>Albion,</hi> and that for two
cauſes; the one in reſpect of the white bancks and cliffes, which
lie toward the ſea: the other, that it might haue ſome affinity,
euen in name alſo, with our owne country, which was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
ſo called.</p>
            <p>Before we went from thence, our generall cauſed to be ſet vp,
a monument of our being there; as alſo of her maieſties, and
ſucceſſors right and title to that kingdome, namely, a plate of
braſſe, faſt nailed to a great and firme poſt; whereon is engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
her graces name, and the day and yeare of our arriuall
there, and of the free giuing vp, of the prouince and kingdome,
both by the king and people, into her maieſties hands: toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with her highneſſe picture, and armes in a piece of ſixpence
currant Engliſh monie, ſhewing it ſelfe by a hole made of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
through the plate: vnderneath was likewiſe engrauen the
name of our generall &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Spaniards neuer had any dealing, or ſo much as ſet a
foote in this country; the vtmoſt of their diſcoueries, reaching
onely to many degrees Southward of this place.</p>
            <p>And now, as the time of our departure was perceiued by
them to draw nigh, ſo did the ſorrowes and miſeries of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
ſeeme to themſelues to increaſe vpon them; and the more
certaine they were of our going away, the more doubtfull they
ſhewed themſelues, what they might doe; ſo that we might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:5654:45"/>
iudge that that ioy (being exceeding great) wherewith they
receiued vs at our firſt arriuall, was cleane drowned in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue
ſorrow for our departing: For they did not onely looſe
on a ſudden all mirth, ioy, glad countenance, pleaſant ſpeeches,
agility of body, familiar reioycing one with another, and all
pleaſure what euer fleſh and bloud might bee delighted in, but
with ſighes and ſorrowings, with heauy hearts and grieued
minds, they powred out wofull complaints and moanes, with
bitter teares and wringing of their hands, tormenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.
And as men refuſing all comfort, they onely accounted
themſelues as caſt-awayes, and thoſe whom the gods were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to forſake: So that nothing we could ſay or do, was able to
eaſe them of their ſo heauy a burthen, or to deliuer them from
ſo deſperate a ſtraite, as our leauing of them did ſeeme to them
that it would caſt them into.</p>
            <p>Howbeit ſeeing they could not ſtill enioy our preſence, they
(ſuppoſing vs to be gods indeed) thought it their duties to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
vs that being abſent, we would yet be mindfull of them,
and making ſignes of their deſires, that in time to come wee
would ſee them againe, they ſtole vpon vs a ſacrifice, and ſet it
on fire erre we were aware; burning therein a chaine and a bunch
of feathers. We laboured by all meanes poſſible to withhold
or withdraw them but could not preuaile, till at laſt we fell to
prayers and ſinging of Pſalmes, whereby they were allured im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
to forget their folly, and leaue their ſacrifice vnconſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
ſuffering the fire to go out, and imitating vs in all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
they fell a lifting vp their eyes and hands to heauen as they
ſaw vs do.</p>

loath to leaue vs, they preſently ranne to the tops of the hils

and behind, and on each ſide of them, burning therein (as
is to be ſuppoſed) ſacrifices at our departure.</p>
            <p>Not farre without this harborough did lye certaine Ilands
(we called them the Ilands of Saint <hi>Iames</hi>) hauing on than plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:5654:46"/>

that the extremity of the cold not only continued but increaſed,
the Sunne being gone farther from vs, and that the wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtill (as it did at firſt) from the Northweſt, cut off all hope of
finding a paſſage through theſe Northerne parts, thought it
neceſſarie to looſe no time; and therefore with generall conſent
of all, bent his courſe directly to tunne with the Ilands of the
Moluccas. And ſo hauing nothing in our view but aire and ſea,
without ſight of any land for the ſpace of full 68. dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
wee continued our courſe through the maine Ocean, till
September 30.<label type="milestone">

               </label> following, on which day we fell in kenne of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Ilands, lying about eight degrees to the Northward of
the line.</p>
            <p>From theſe Ilands preſent'y vpon the diſcouery of vs, came
a great number of canowes, hauing each of them in ſome
foure, in ſome ſixe, in ſome fourteene or fifteene men, bringing
with them Coques, fiſh, Potatos, and certaine fruites to ſmall
purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Their canowes were made after the faſhion, that the canowes
of all the reſt of the Ilands of Moluccas for the moſt part are:
That is of one tree, hollowed within with great art and cunning,
being made ſo ſmooth both within and without, that they bore
a gloſſe, as if it were a harneſſe moſt finely burniſhed: A prowe
and ſterne they had of one faſhion, yeelding inward in manner
of a ſemicircle, of a great height, and hanged full of certaine
white and gliſtering ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ls for brauery: One each ſide of their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nows,
lay out two peeces of timber about a yard and halfe long,
more or leſſe according to the capacitie of their boate. At the
ends whereof was faſtned croſſewiſe a great cane, the vſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was to keepe their canowes from ouerthrowing, and that they
might be equally borne vp on each ſide.</p>
            <p>The people themſelues haue the neather parts of their eares
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:5654:46"/>
cut round or circlewiſe, hanging downe very low vpon their
cheeks, wherein they hang things of a reaſonable weight: the
nailes on the fingers of ſome of them, were at leaſt an inch long,
and their teeth as blacke as pitch; the colour whereof they vſe to
renew by often eating of an herbe, with a kind of powder, which
in a cane they carrie about them to the ſame purpoſe. The firſt
ſort and company of thoſe canowes beeing come to our ſhip
(which then by reaſon of a ſcant wind made little way) very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly
and againſt their natures, began in peace to traffique with
vs, giuing vs one thing for another very orderly, intending (as
we perceiued) hereby to worke a greater miſchiefe to vs: Intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vs by ſignes moſt earneſtly to draw neerer towards the
ſhore, that they might (if poſſible) make the eaſier prey both of
the ſhip and vs. But theſe paſſing away, and others continually
reſorting, wee were quickly able to gueſſe at them what they
were: For if they receiued any thing once into their hands, they
would neither giue recompence nor reſtitution of it, but
thought what euer they could finger to bee their owne: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
always with browes of braſſe to receiue more, but
would part with nothing: Yea being reiected for their bad dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
as thoſe with whom we would haue no more to do, vſing
vs ſo euilly, they could not be ſatisfied till they had giuen the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to reuenge themſelues, becauſe we would not giue them
whatſoeuer they would haue for nothing: And hauing ſtones
good ſtore in their canowes, let flie a maine of them againſt vs.
It was farre from our Generals meaning to requite their malice
by like iniurie. Yet that they might know that be had power to
doe them harme (if he had liſted) he cauſed a great peece to be
ſhot off not to hurt them but to affright them. Which wrought
the deſired effect amongſt them, for at the noiſe thereof, they
euery one leaped out of his canow into the water, and diuing
vnder the keele of their boates, ſtaied them from going any way
till our ſhip was gone a good way from them. Then they all
lightly recouered into their canowes, and got them with ſpeed
toward the ſhoare.</p>

Notwithſtanding other new companies (but all of the ſame

was no good to be got by violence, they put on a ſhew of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
honeſtie, and offering in ſhew to deale with vs by way of
exchange; vnder that pretence they cunningly fell a filching of
what they could, and one of them puld a dagger and kniues from
one of our mens girdles, and being required to reſtore it againe,
he rather vſed what meanes he could to catch at more. Neither
could we at all be to ridde of this vngracious company, till we

4. his deputy or Viceroy with all expedition came off to
our ſhip in a canow, and without any feare or doubting of our
good meaning came preſently aboard. Who after ſome confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with our Generall, intreated him by any meanes to runne
with <hi>Terenate,</hi> not with <hi>Tidore,</hi> aſſuring him that his king would
be wondrous glad of his comming, and be ready to do for him
what he could, and what our Generall in reaſon ſhould require:
For which purpoſe he himſelfe would that night bee with his
king to carry him the newes: with whom if he once dealt, he
ſhould find, that as he was a king ſo his word ſhould ſtand; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
if he dealt with the Portingals (who had the command of
<hi>Tidore</hi>) he ſhould find in them nothing but deceit and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And beſides that if he went to <hi>Tidore</hi> before he came to <hi>Tere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi>
than would his king haue nothing to doe with vs, for he
held the Portingall as an enemy. On theſe perſwaſions our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
reſolued to runne with <hi>Terenate,</hi> where the next day very
early in the morning we came to anchor: And preſently, our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
ſent a meſſenger to the king with a veluet cloake, for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
and token that his comming ſhould be in peace: and that
he required no other thing at his hands, but that (his victuals
being ſpent in ſo long a voiage) he might haue ſupply from him
by way of traffique and exchange of marchandiſe (whereof he
had ſtore of diuers ſorts) of ſuch things as he wanted. Which
he thought he might be the bolder to require at his hands, both
for that the thing was lawfull, and that he offered him no preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
or wrong therein, as alſo becauſe he was intreated to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
to that place by his Viceroy at Mutir, who aſſured him of
neceſſarie prouiſion in ſuch manner as now he required the
ſame.</p>
            <p>Before this, the Viceroy according to his promiſe had beene
with the king, ſignifying vnto him what a mighty Prince and
kingdome we belonged vnto, what good things the king might
receiue from vs, not onely now, but for hereafter by way of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:5654:48"/>
traffique: yea what honour and benefit it might be to him, to be
in league and friendſhip with ſo noble and famous a Prince as
we ſerued: And farther what a diſcouragement it would be to
the Portugals his enemies to heare and ſee it: In hearing whereof
the king was ſo preſently moued to the well liking of the matter,
that before our meſſenger could come halfe the way, he had
ſent the Viceroy with diuers others of his Nobles and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors
to our Generall, with ſpeciall meſſage that he ſhould not
onely haue what things he needed, or would require with peace
and friendſhip, but that be would willingly entertaine amitie
with ſo famous and renowned a Princes as was ours, and that
if it ſeemed good in her eyes to accept of it, he would ſequeſter
the commodities and traffique of his whole Iland from others,
eſpecially from his enemies the Portugals (from whom he had
nothing but by the ſword) and reſerue it to the intercourſe of
our Nation, if we would embrace it: In token whereof he had
now ſent to our Generall his ſignet, and would within ſhort time
after, come in his owne perſon with his brethren and Nobles
with boats or canowes into our ſhip, and be a meanes of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her into a ſafer harbour.</p>
            <p>While they were deliuering their meſſage to vs, our meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
was come vnto the Court, who being met by the way by
certaine noble perſonages, was with great ſolemnitie conueied
into the kings preſence: at whoſe hands he was moſt friendly
and graciouſly entertained, and hauing deliuered his errand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with his preſent vnto the king, the king ſeemed to him to
iudge himſelfe blame-worthy, that he had not ſooner haſted in
perſon to preſent himſelfe to our Generall, who came ſo farre
and from ſo great a Prince; And preſently with all expedition, he
made ready himſelfe with the chiefeſt of all his States and
Councellors to make repaire vnto vs.</p>
            <p>The manner of his comming as it was princely, ſo truly it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to vs very ſtrange &amp; maruellous: ſeruing at the preſent not
ſo much to ſet out his owne royall and kingly ſtate (which was
great) as to do honour to her highneſſe to whom we belonged;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:5654:48"/>
wherein how willingly he imployed himſelfe, the ſequell will
make manifeſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore, before his comming, did he ſend off 3. great
and large Canowes; in each whereof, were certaine of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
perſonages that were about him, attired all of them in white
Lawne, or cloth of Calecut, hauing ouer their heads, from one
end of the Canow to the other, a couering of thinne and fine
mats, borne vp by a frame made of reedes, vnder which euery
man ſate in order according to his dignity; the hoary heads, of
many of them, ſet forth the greater reuerence due to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and manifeſtly ſhewed, that the king vſed the aduice of a
graue and prudent Counſell, in his affaires. Beſides theſe, were
diuerſe others, young and comely men, a great number attired
in white as were the other, but with manifeſt differences: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
their places alſo vnder the ſame couering, but in inferior
order, as their calling required.</p>
            <p>The reſt of the men were ſouldiers, who ſtood in comely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
round about on both ſides; on the outſide of whom, againe
did ſit the rowers in certaine galleries, which being 3. on each
ſide all alongſt the Canow, did lie off from the ſide thereof,
ſome 3. or 4. yards, one being orderly builded lower then the
other: in euery of which galleries was an equall number of
banckes, whereon did ſit the rowers, about the number of foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcoure
in one Canow: In the forepart of each Canow, ſate two
men, the one holding a Tabret, the other a piece of braſſe,
whereon they both at once ſtroke; and obſeruing a due time
and reaſonable ſpace betweene each ſtroake by the ſound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
directed the rowers to keepe their ſtroake with their oares;
as on the contrary, the rowers ending their ſtroake with a ſong,
gaue warning to the others to ſtrike againe; and ſo continued
they their way with maruelous ſwiftneſſe: neither were their
Canowes naked or vnfurniſhed of warlike munition, they had
each of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, at leaſt one ſmall caſt piece of about a yard in length
mounted vpon a ſtocke, which was ſet vpright; beſides euery
man except the rowers, had his ſword, dagger, and target, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:5654:49"/>
ſome of them ſome other weapons, as, lances, calliuers, bowes,
arrowes, and many darts.</p>
            <p>Theſe Canowes comming neere our ſhip in order, rowed
round about vs one after another; and the men as they paſſe by
vs, did vs a kinde of homage with great ſolemnity, the greateſt
perſonages beginning firſt, with reuerend countenance and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour,
to bow their bodies euen to the ground: which done,
they put our owne meſſenger aboard vs againe, and ſignified to
vs, that their king (who himſelfe was comming) had ſent them
before him, to conduct our ſhip into a better roade, deſiring a
halſer to be giuen them forth, that they might employ their
ſeruice as their king commanded, in towing our ſhip therewith
to the place aſſigned.</p>
            <p>The king himſelfe was not farre behinde, but he alſo with 6.
graue and ancient fathers in his Canow approaching, did at
once together with them, yeeld vs a reuerend kinde of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
in farre more humble manner, then was to be expected;
he was of a tall ſtature, very corpulent and well ſet together, of
a very princely and gratious countenance; his reſpect amongſt
his owne was ſuch, that neither his Viceroy of Mutir aforena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
nor any other of his counſellers, durſt ſpeake vnto him
but vpon their knees, not riſing againe till they were licenced.</p>
            <p>Whoſe comming as it was to our generall, no ſmall cauſe of
goodliking, ſo was he receiued in the beſt manner we could, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
vnto his ſtate: our ordinance thundred, which wee
mixed with great ſtore of ſmall ſhot, among which ſounding
our trumpets, and other inſtruments of muſick, both of ſtill and
loud noiſe, where with he was ſo much delighted, that requeſting
our muſick to come into the boate, hee ioyned his Canow
to the ſame, and was towed at leaſt a whole houre together,
with the boate at the ſterne of our ſhip: Beſides this, our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
ſent him ſuch preſents, as he thought, might both requite
his curteſy already receiued, and worke a farther confirmation,
of that goodliking and friendſhip already begunne.</p>
            <p>The king being thus in muſicall paradiſe, and enioying that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:5654:49"/>
wherewith he was ſo highly pleaſed; his brother named <hi>Moro</hi>
with no leſſe brauery, then any of the reſt, accompanied alſo
with a great number of gallant followers, made the like repaire,
and gaue vs like reſpect; and his homage done he fell aſterne of
vs, till we came to anchor: neither did our generall leaue his
curteſie vnrewarded, but bountifully pleaſed him alſo before
we parted.</p>
            <p>The king as ſoone as we were come to anchor, craued par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
to be gone, and ſo tooke leaue, promiſing vs, that the next
day he would come aboard, and in the meane time would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
and ſend ſuch victualls, as were requiſite and neceſſary for
our prouiſion.</p>
            <p>Accordingly the ſame night, and the morrow following, we
receiued what was there to be had, by way of traffique, to wir,
rice in pretty quantity, hennes, ſugar canes, imperfect and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid
ſugar, a fruit which they call <hi>Figo (Magellane</hi> calls it a
figge of a ſpan long, but is no other then that which the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
and Portingalls haue named <hi>Plantanes) Cocoes</hi> and a kind of
meale which they call <hi>Sago,</hi> made of the toppes of certaine
trees, taſting in the mouth like ſoure curdes, but meltes away
like ſugar; whereof they make a kinde of cake which will keepe
good at leaſt 10. yeares; of this laſt we made the greateſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of our prouiſion: for a few cloues wee did alſo traffique,
whereof for, a ſmall matter, wee might haue had greater ſtore,
then we could well tell where to beſtow: but our generalls care
was, that the ſhip ſhould not be too much peſtered or annoyed
therewith.</p>
            <p>At the time appointed, our generall (hauing ſet all things in
order to receiue him) looked for the kings returne, who failing
both in time and promiſe, ſent his brother to make his excuſe,
and to intreat our generall to come on ſhoare; his brother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the while to remaine aboard, as a pawne for his ſafe reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring:
our generall could willingly haue conſented, if the king
himſelf had not firſt broke his word: the conſideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
bred an vtter diſliking in the whole company, who by no
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:5654:50"/>
meanes would giue conſent, he ſhould hazard himſelfe, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
for that the kings brother had vttered certaine words, in
ſecret conference with our generall aboard his cabbin, which
bred no ſmall ſuſpition of ill intent; our generall being thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
not to goe aſhoare at that time, reſerued the Viceroy for
a pledge, and ſo ſent certaine of his gentlemen to the court,
both to accompany the kings brother, and alſo with ſpeciall
meſſage to the king himſelfe.</p>
            <p>They being come ſomewhat neere vnto the caſtle, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
by another brother of the kings, and certaine others of
the greateſt ſtates, and conducted with great honour towards
the caſtle, where being brought into a large and faire houſe,
they ſaw gathered together a great multitude of people, by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
at leaſt 1000. the chiefe whereof, were placed round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the houſe, according as it ſeemed to their degrees and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
the reſt remained without.</p>
            <p>The houſe was in forme foure ſquare, couered all ouer with
cloth of diuerſe colours, not much vnlike our vſuall pentadoes
borne vpon a frame of reedes, the ſides being open from the
groundſell to the couering, and furniſhed with ſeates round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout:
it ſeemes it was there councell-houſe and not commonly
employed to any other vſe.</p>
            <p>At the ſide of this houſe, next vnto the caſtle was ſeated the
chaire of ſtate, hauing directly ouer it, and extending very large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
euery way, a very faire and rich canopy, as the ground alſo
for ſome 10. or 12. paſes compaſſe, was couered with cloth
of Arras.</p>
            <p>Whileſt our gentlemen attended in this place the comming
of the king, which was about the ſpace of halfe an houre, they
had the better opportunity to obſerue theſe things; as alſo that
before the kings comming, there were already ſet threeſcore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
graue and ancient perſonages, all of them reported to be of
the kings priuy Councell: at the neather end of the houſe were
placed a great company of yong men, comely perſonage and
attire. With out the houſe on the right ſide, ſtood foure ancient
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:5654:50"/>
comely hoare-headed men, cloathed all in red downe to the
ground, but attired on their heads not much vnlike the Turkes;
theſe they called Romans, or ſtrangers, who lay as lidgiers there
to keepe continuall traffique with this people: there were alſo
two Turkes one Italian as lidgiers: and laſt of all one Spaniard,
who being freed by the kings out of the hands of the Portugals,
in the recouering of the Iland, ſerued him now in ſtead of a
ſouldier.</p>
            <p>The king at laſt comming from the caſtle, with 8. or 10. more
graue Senators following him, had a very rich canopy (adorned
in the middeſt with emboſſings of gold) borne ouer him, and
was garded with 12. lances the points turned downeward: our
men (accompanied with <hi>Moro</hi> the kings brother) aroſe to meet
him, and he very gratiouſly did welcome and entertaine them.</p>
            <p>He was for perſon, ſuch as we haue before deſcribed him, of
lowe voice, temperate in ſpeech, of kingly demeanour, and a
Moore by nation. His attire was after the faſhion of the reſt of
his countrey, but farre more ſumptuous, as his condition and
ſtate required: from the waſt to the ground, was all cloth of
gold, and that very rich; his legges bare, but on his feet a paire
of ſhooes of cordiuant died red: in the attire of his head, were
finely wreathed in diuerſe rings of plated gold, of an inch, or an
inch and halfe in breadth, which made a faire and princely ſhew,
ſomewhat reſembling a crowne in forme; about his necke hee
had a chaine of perfect gold, the linkes very great and onefold
double; on his left hand was a Diamond, an Emerald, a Ruby,
and a Turky, 4, very faire and perfect jewells, on his right hand
in one ring, a big and perfect Turky, and in another ring many
Diamonds of a ſmaller ſize, very artificially ſet and couched
together.</p>
            <p>As thus he ſate in his chaire of State, at his right ſide there
ſtood a page with a very coſtly fanne (richly embrodered and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet
with Saphires) breathing &amp; gathering the aire to refreſh the
king, the place very hot, both by reaſon of the ſunne, and
the aſſembly of ſo great a multitude. After a while our gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:5654:51"/>
men hauing deliuered their meſſage, and receiued anſwer, were
licenced to depart, and were ſafely conducted backe againe, by
one of the chiefe of the kings Councell, who had charge from
the king himſelfe to performe the ſame.</p>
            <p>Our gentlemen obſeruing the caſtle as well as they could,
could not couceiue it to be a place of any great force: two onely
canons they there ſaw, and thoſe at that preſent vntrauerſable
becauſe vnmounted. Theſe with all other furniture of like ſort
which they haue, they haue gotten them from the Portingals, by
whom the caſtle it ſelfe was alſo builded, whiles they inhabited
that place and Iland. Who ſeeking to ſettle a tyrannous gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(as in other places ſo) ouer this people, and not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themſelues with a better eſtate then they deſerued (except
they might (as they thought) make ſure worke by leauing none
of the royall bloud aliue, who ſhould make challenge to the
kingdome) cruelly murthered the king himſelfe (father to him
who now raignes) and intended the like to all his ſonnes. Which
cauelty inſtead of eſtabliſhing, brought ſuch a ſhaking on their
vſurped eſtate, that they were faine, without couenanting to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
away goods, munition, or any thing elſe to quitte the place
and the whole Iland to ſaue their liues.</p>
            <p>For the preſent king with his brethren in reuenge of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
murther, ſo beſtirred themſelues, that the Portingall was
wholly driuen from that Iland, and glad that he yet keepes foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in <hi>Tidore.</hi> Theſe foure yeares this king hath beene increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
and was (as was affirmed) at that preſent, Lord of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Ilands thereabout; and was euen now preparing his forces
to hazard a chance with the Portingals for <hi>Tidore</hi> it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>The people are Moores, whoſe Religion conſiſts much in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
ſuperſtitious obſeruations of new Moones, and certaine
ſeaſons, with a rigid and ſtrickt kind of faſting. We had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
hereof in the Viceroy and his retinue, who lay aboard vs all
the time for the moſt part during our abode in this place: who
during their perſcribed time, would neither eate not drinke, not
ſo much as a cup of cold water in the day (ſo zealous are they
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:5654:51"/>
in their ſelfe deuiſed worſhip) but yet in the night would eate
threetimes, and that very largely. This <hi>Terenate</hi> ſtands in 27.
min. North latitude.</p>
            <p>While we rode at anchor in the harbour at <hi>Terenate,</hi> beſides
the natiues there came aboard vs another, a goodly gentleman,
very well accompanied with his interpreter, to view our ſhip,
and to conferre with our Generall: he was apparelled much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our manner, moſt neate and Courtlike: his carriage the moſt
reſpectiue, and full of diſcreet behauiour that euer we had ſeene;
Hee told vs that he was himſelfe but a ſtranger in thoſe Ilands,
being a naturall of the Prouince of <hi>Paghia</hi> in <hi>China;</hi> his name,
<hi>Pauſaos</hi> of the familie of <hi>Hombu:</hi> of which familie there had 11.
raigned in continuall ſucceſſion theſe two hundred yeares, and
king <hi>Bonog</hi> by the death of his elder brother (who dyed by a fall
from his horſe) the rightfull heire of all <hi>China,</hi> is the twelfth of
this race: he is of 22. yeares of age: his mother yet liuing: he hath
a wife, and by her ſonne: he is well beloued, and highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
of all his ſubjects, and liues in great peace from any feare
of forreine inuaſion: but it was not this mans fortune to enioy
his part of this happineſſe both of his king and countrey, as hee
moſt deſired.</p>
            <p>For being accuſed of a capitall crime whereof (through free)
yet he could not euidently make his innocency appeare, and
knowing the peremptory iuſtice of <hi>China,</hi> to be irreuocable, if
he ſhould expect the ſentence of the Iudges; he before hand
made ſuite to his king, that it would pleaſe him to commit his
trial to Gods prouidence and iudgement, and to that end to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him to trauell on this condition, that if the brought not home
ſome worthy intelligence, ſuch as his Maieſtie had neuer had
before, and were moſt fit to be knowne, and moſt honorable for
<hi>China,</hi> he ſhould for euer liue an exile, or elſe dye for daring to
ſet foot againe in his owne countrey: for he was aſſured that the
God of heauen had care of innocency.</p>
            <p>The king granted his ſuite, and now he had beene three yeares
abroad, and at this preſent came from <hi>Tidore</hi> (where he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:5654:52"/>
two moneths) to ſee the Engliſh Generall, of whom he
heard ſuch ſtrange things, and from him (if it pleaſed God to
afford it) to learne ſome ſuch intelligence as might make way
for his returne into his countrey: and therefore he earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
our Generall, to make relation to him of the occaſion,
way, and manner of his coming ſo far from England thither,
with the manifold occurrences that had happened to him by
the way.</p>
            <p>Our Generall gaue ample ſatisfaction to each part of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt:
the ſtranger hearkened with great attention and delight
to his diſcourſe, and as he naturally excelled in memory (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
his helpe of art to better the ſame) ſo he firmely printed it
in his mind, and with great reuerence thanked God, who had ſo
vnexpectedly brought him, to the notice of ſuch admirable
things. Then fell he to intreate our Generall with many moſt
earneſt and vehement perſuaſions, that be would be content to
ſee his countrey before his departure any farther Weſtward, that
it ſhould be a moſt pleaſant, moſt honourable, and moſt profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
thing for him that he ſhould gaine hereby the notice, and
carrie home the deſcription of one of the moſt ancient, migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt
and richeſt kingdomes in the world. Hereupon he tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to relate the number and greatneſſe of the Prouinces, with
the rare commodities and good things they yeelded: the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
ſtatelineſſe, and riches of their Cities, with what abundance
of men, victuals, munition, and all manner of neceſſaries and
delightfull things they were ſtored with: In particular, touching
ordnance and great gunnes (the late inuention of a ſcab-ſhind
F<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>er amongſt vs in Europe) he related that in <hi>Suntien</hi> (by ſome
called <hi>Quinzai</hi>) which is the chiefeſt Citie of all <hi>China,</hi> they had
braſſe ordnance of all ſorts (much eaſier to be trauerſed then
ours were, and ſo perfectly made that they would hit a ſhillng)
aboue 2000. yeares agoe. With many other worthy things
which our Generals owne experience (if it would pleaſe him to
make triall) would (better then his relation) aſſure him of. The
brize would ſhortly ſerue very fitly to carrie him thither, and he

ſtanding in 1. deg. 40, min. towards the pole antarticke:
which being without inhabitants, gaue vs the better hope of
quiet abode. We anchored and finding the place conuenient
for our purpoſes (there wanting nothing here which we ſtood
in need of, but onely water which wee were faine to fetch from
another Iland ſomewhat farther to the South) made our abode
herefor 26. whole dayes together.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing we did, we pitched our tents and intrenched
ourſelues as ſtrongly as we could vpon the ſhoare, leſt at any
time perhaps we might haue beene diſturbed by the inhabitants
of the greater Iland which lay not farre to the Weſtward of vs;
after we had prouided thus for our ſecurity, wee landed our
goods, and had a Smiths forge ſet vp, both for the making of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:5654:53"/>
ſome neceſſarie ſhipworke, and for the repairing of ſome iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooped
caskes, without which they could not long haue ſerued
our vſe: and for that our Smiths coales were all ſpent long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this time; there was order giuen and followed for the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of charcoale, by which that want might be ſupplyed.</p>
            <p>We trimd our ſhip, and performed our other buſineſſes to
our content. The place affording vs not onely all neceſſaries
(which we had not of our owne before) thereunto, but alſo
wonderfull refreſhing to our wearied bodies, by the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
reliefe and excellent prouiſion that here we found, whereby
of ſickely, weake, and decayed (as many of vs ſeemed to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our comming hither) we in ſhort ſpace grew all of vs to be
ſtrong, luſty, and healthfull perſons. Beſides this, we had rare
experience of Gods wonderfull wiſedome in many rare and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
creatures which here we ſaw.</p>
            <p>The whole Iland is a through growne wood, the trees for the
moſt part are of large and high ſtature, very ſtraight and cleane
without bowes, ſaue onely in the very top. The leaues whereof
are nor much vnlike our broomes in England: Among theſe
trees, night by night did ſhew themſelues an infinite ſmarme of
fierie-ſeeming-wormes flying in the aire, whoſe bodies (no big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then an ordinary flie) did make a ſhew, and giue ſuch light
as if euery twigge on euery tree had beene a lighted candle: or
as if that place had beene the ſtarry ſpheare. To theſe wee may
adde the relation of another almoſt as ſtrange a creature, which
here we ſaw, and that was an innumerable multitude of huge
Bats or reare-mice, equalling or rather exceeding a good Henne
in bigneſſe. They flie with maruellous ſwiftneſſe, but their flight
is very ſhort; and when they light, they hang onely by the
bowes with their backes downeward.</p>
            <p>Neither may wee without ingratitude (by reaſon of the
ſpecial vſe we made of them) omit to ſpeake of the huge multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
of a certaine kinde of Crayfiſh, of ſuch a ſize, that one was
ſufficient to ſatisfie foure hungry men at a dinner, being a very

earths, as do the conies, or rather they dig great and huge caues,

they lodge themſelues by companies together. Of the ſame ſort

ſuſpition of danger appearing to vs, and we were now ſailing
onward with full ſailes, in the beginning of the firſt watch of the

a deſperate ſhoale, with no other likelihood in appearance,
but that wee with her muſt there preſently periſh: there being
no probability how any thing could be ſaued, or any perſon

            <p>The vnexpectedneſſe of ſo extreame a danger, preſently rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
vs vp to looke about vs, but the more we looked, the leſſe
hope we had of getting cleere of it againe, ſo that nothing now
preſenting it ſelfe to our mindes, but the ghaſtly appearance of
inſtant death, affording no reſpit or time of pauſing, called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vs to turne our thoughts another way, to renounce the
world to deny our ſelues, and to commend our ſelues into the
mercifull hands of our moſt gratious God: to this purpoſe wee
preſently fell proſtrate, and with ioyned prayers ſent vp vnto the
throne of grace, humbly beſought almighty God, to extend his
mercy vnto vs in his ſonne <hi>Chriſt Ieſus;</hi> and ſo preparing as it
were our necks vnto the blocke, we euery minute expected the
ſmall ſtroake to be giuen vnto vs.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding that we expected nothing but imminent
death, yet (that we might not ſeeme to tempt God, by leauing
any ſecond meanes vnattempted which he afforded) preſently as
ſoone as prayers were ended our generall (exhorting vs to haue
the eſpecialleſt care of the better part, to wit, the ſoule, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
many comfortable ſpeeches, of the ioyes of that other life,
which wee now alone looked for) incouraged vs all to beſtirre
our ſelues, ſhewing vs the way thereto by his owne example;
and firſt of all the pump being well plyed, and the ſhip freed of
water, we found our leaks to be nothing increaſed, which
thought it gaue vs no hope of deliuerance, yet it gaue vs ſome
hope of reſpit, inſomuch, as it aſſured vs that the bulke was
ſound, which truly we acknowledged to be an immediate proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God alone, inſomuch, as no ſtrength of wood and iron
could haue poſſibly borne ſo hard and violent a ſhocke, as our
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:5654:54"/>
ſhip did, daſhing herſelfe vnder full ſaile againſt the rockes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the extraordinary hand of God, had ſupported the
ſame.</p>
            <p>Our next aſſay was for good ground and anchor-hold, to ſea,
ward of vs (whereon to hale) by which meanes if by any, our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
put vs in comfort, that there was yet left ſome hope ro
cleere our ſelues: in his owne perſon, he therefore vndertooke
the charge of ſounding, and but euen a boates length from the
ſhip, he found that the bottom could not by any length of line
be reached vnto: ſo that the beginnings of hope, which wee
were willing to haue conceiued before, were by this meanes
quite daſht againe; yea our miſery ſeemed to be increaſed, for
whereas at firſt wee could looke for nothing but a preſent end,
that expectation was now turned, into the awaiting for a
lingring death, of the two, the farre more fearefull to be choſen:
one thing fell out happily for vs, that the moſt of our men did
not conceiue this thing, which had they done, they would in all
likelihood haue beene ſo much diſcouraged, that their ſorrow
would the more diſable them, to haue ſought the remedy: our
generall with thoſe few others, that could iudge of the euent
wiſely, diſſembling the ſame, and giuing in the meane time
cheerfull ſpeeches, and good incouragements vnto the reſt.</p>
            <p>For whiles it ſeemed to be a cleere caſe, that our ſhip was ſo
faſt moared, that ſhee could not ſtirr; it neceſſary followed,
that either we were there to remaine on the place with her; or
elſe leauing her to commit our ſelues in moſt poore end help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
ſtate, to ſeeke ſome other place of ſtay and refuge, the
better of which two choices, did carry with it the appearance of
worſe then 1000. deathes.</p>
            <p>As touching our ſhip, this was the comfort that ſhee could
giue vs, that ſhee her ſelfe lying there confined already vpon
the hard and pinching rocks, did tell vs plaine, that ſhee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
expected her ſpeedy diſpatch, as ſoone as the ſea and
windes ſhould come, to be the ſeuere executioners of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy
iudgement, by the appointment of the eternall iudge alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:5654:55"/>
giuen vpon her, who had committed her there to Adaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
bonds in a moſt narrow priſon, againſt their comming for
that purpoſe: ſo that if we would ſtay with her, we muſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
with her; or if any by any yet vnperceiueable meanes,
ſhould chance to be deliuered, his eſcape muſt needs be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
miſery, it being farre better to haue periſhed together,
then with the loſſe and abſence of his friends, to liue in a ſtrange
land: whether a ſolitary life (the better choice) among wild
beaſtes, as a bird on the mountaines without all comfort, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the barbarous people of the heathen, in intollerable
bondage both of body and minde.</p>
            <p>And put the caſe that her day of deſtruction ſhould be defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
longer then either reaſon could perſwade vs, or in any like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
could ſeeme poſſible (it being not in the power of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things, to indure what ſhee had ſuffred already) yet could our
abode there profit vs nothing, but increaſe our wretchedneſſe,
and enlarge our ſorrows, for as her ſtore and victualls were not
much (ſufficient to ſuſtaine vs onely ſome few daies, without
hope of hauing any increaſe, no not ſo much as of a cup of cold
water) ſo muſt it ineuitably come to paſſe, that we (as children in
the mothers wombe) ſhould be driuen euen to eate the fleſh
from of our owne armes, ſhee being no longer able to ſuſtaine
vs; and how horrible a thing this would haue proued, is eaſy by
any one to be perceiued.</p>
            <p>And whither (had we departed from her) ſhould we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
any comfort; nay the very impoſſibility of going, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to be no leſſe, then thoſe other before mentioned: our
boate was by no meanes able at once, to carry aboue 20. perſons
with any ſafety, and we were 58. in all, the neereſt land was ſix
leagues from vs, and the winde from the ſhoare directly bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
vs: or ſhould we haue thought of ſetting ſome aſhoare,
and after that to haue fetched the reſt, there being no place
thereabout without inhabitants, the firſt that had landed muſt
firſt haue fallen into the hand of the enemie, and ſo the reſt in
order, and though perhaps we might eſcape the ſword, yet
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:5654:55"/>
would our life haue beene worſe then death, not alone in reſpect
of our wofull captiuity, and bodily mifſeries, but moſt of all in
reſpectt of our Chriſtian liberty, being to be depriued of all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
meanes of ſeruing the true God, and continually grieued
with the horrible impieties and diuelliſh idolatries of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</p>
            <p>Our miſerie beeing thus manifeſt, the very conſideration
wherof muſt needs haue ſhaken fleſh and bloud, if faith in Gods
promiſes had not mightily ſuſtained vs, we paſt the night with
earneſt longings that the day would once appeare, the meane
time we ſpent in often prayers, and other godly exerciſes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
comforting our ſelues; and refreſhing our hearts, ſtriuing to
bring our ſelues to an humble ſubmiſſion vnder the hand of
God, and to a referring our ſelues wholly to his good will and
pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The day therefore at length appearing, and it being almoſt
full ſea about that time, after we had giuen thankes to God for
his forbearing of vs hitherto, and had with teares called vpon
him to bleſſe our labours; we againe renewed our trauell, to ſee
if we could now poſſibly find any anchor-hold, which we had
formerly ſought in vaine. But this ſecond attempt proued as
fruitleſſe as the former, and left vs nothing to truſt to, but pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and teares, ſeeing it appeared impoſſible that euer the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt
counſell, pollicie, or power of man could euer effect the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuery
of our ſhip, except the Lord onely miraculouſly ſhould
do the ſame.</p>
            <p>It was therefore preſently motioned, and by generall voice
determined to commend our caſe to God alone, leauing our
ſelues wholly in his hand; to ſpill or ſaue vs as ſeeme beſt to his
gracious wiſedome. And that our faith might bee the better
ſtrengthened, and the comfortable apprehenſion of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
in Chriſt, be more clearely felt; we had a Sermon and the
Sacrament of the bodie and bloud of our Sauiour celebrated.</p>
            <p>After this ſweet repaſt was thus receiued, and other holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
adioyned were ended, leſt we ſhould ſeeme guilty in any
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:5654:56"/>
reſpect for not vſing all lawfull meanes we could inuent; we fell
to one other practiſe yet vnaſſayed, to wit, to vnloading of our
ſhip by caſting ſome of her goods into the ſea: which thing as it
was attempted moſt willingly, ſo was it diſpatched in very ſhort
time. So that euen thoſe things which we before this time, nor
any other in our caſe could be without, did now ſeeme as things
onely worthy to be deſpiſed, yea we were herein ſo forward,
that neither our munition for defence, nor the very meale for
ſuſtentation of our liues could find fauour with vs, but euerie
thing as it firſt came to hand went ouerboard aſſuring our ſelues
of this, that if it pleaſed God once to deliuer vs out of that moſt
deſperate ſtrait wherein we were, he would fight for vs againſt
our enemies, neither would he ſuffer vs to periſh for want of
bread. But when all was done, it was not any of our endeuours,
but Gods onely hand that wrought our deliuerie; twas he alone
that brought vs euen vnder the very ſtroake of death; twas he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
that ſaid vnto vs, Returne againe ye ſonnes of men; twas he
alone that ſet vs at liberty againe, that made vs ſafe and free, after
that we had remained in the former miſerable condition, the
full ſpace of twentie houres, to his glorious name be the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
praiſe.</p>
            <p>The manner of our deliuery (for the relation of it will eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
be expected) was onely this. The place whereon we ſate
ſo faſt, was a firme rocke in a cleft, whereof it was we ſtucke on
the larbord ſide' at low water there was not aboue ſixe foote
depth in all on the ſtarbord, within little diſtance as you haue
heard no bottome to be found, the brize during the whole
time that we thus were ſtayed, blew ſomewhat ſtiffe directly
againſt out broad ſide, and ſo perforce kept the ſhip vpright: It
pleaſed God in the beginning of the tyde, while the water was
yet almoſt at loweſt, to ſlacke the ſtiffeneſſe of the wind; and
now out ſhip who required thirteene foot water to make her
fleet, and had not at that time on the one ſide aboue ſeuen at
moſt, wanting her prop on the other ſide, which had too long
alreadie kept her vp, fell a heeling towards the deepe water, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:5654:56"/>
by that meanes freed her keele and made vs glad men.</p>
            <p>This ſhoale is at leaſt three or foure leagues in length, it lies
in 2. deg. lacking three or foure minutes South latitude. The
day of this deliuerance was the tenth of Ianuary.<label type="milestone">

            </p>
            <p>Of all the dangers that in our whole voyage we met with, this
was the greateſt, but it was not the laſt as may appeare by what
enſueth. Neither could we indeed for a long ſeaſon free our
ſelues from the continuall care and feare of them; nor could we
euer come to any conuenient anchoring, but were continually
for the moſt pare toſt amongſt the many Ilands and ſhoales
(which lye in infinite number round about on the South parts
