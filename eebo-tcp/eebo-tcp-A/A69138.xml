            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And all be it there is mention made of the donation or gifte in the pagine or writte of the priuyledge: yet is nat therfore to be ſuppoſed &amp; thought / that the dona<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion was accepted &amp; taken. But rather contrary wiſe bycauſe there is no mention made of the acceptation: it is to be ſayd / that it was nat gyuen.

And we ought nat onely to deme / that Sylueſter dyd refuſe theſe gyftes: but alſo that he dyd ſecretely ſhewe / that nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine might rightfully gyue them / neither himſelfe laufully receyue or take them.

Where was poſſeſſyon gyuen? Where was the delyuering vp in to his handes? For if Conſtantine dyd gyue to Sylueſter nothing elſes but onely the dede or writi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g: than was nat his mynde to do Silueſter a pleaſure or good turne: but to gyue him a mocke. you ſaye it is very lykely / that he / whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che doth gyue any thinge: dothe alſo delyuer poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyon of the ſame. Take hede / and be ware what you ſpeke / ſeing that it is vndoubted / that poſſeſſyon was neuer delyuered: and it is alſo doubte / whether euer the ryght and tytle were gyuen or nat. It is lyke to be true / that he which gaue nat the poſſeſſyon wolde nat gyue the right and tytle. Is it nat vndouted and of certaynte / that poſſeſſyon was neuer delyuered? whiche thyng who ſo euer wyll denye: he is without all honeſtie / and vtterly ſhamles.

Though Sylueſter wold nat at that tyme haue requyred this to be done: yet dyd it appertayne and belonge to the magnifycencie of Conſtantyne (that he might declare / nat onely by his wordes / but alſo by his dede / that he dyd gyue poſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeſſyon to Sylueſter / to haue depoſed his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes / lyeutynauntes / and other offycers / &amp; to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde other to be put into their roumes / by the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination &amp; aſſygnement of Sylueſter.
