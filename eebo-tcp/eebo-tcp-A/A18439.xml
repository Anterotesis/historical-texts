            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Chriſtian Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S there haue riſen vp in the Church from time to time falſe Prophets &amp; teachers, <note place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 1.</note> which oppoſe them ſelues to the holye Prophets of God, and true teachers of his worde: ſo among the people where ſuch contrarietie of doctrines hath bene deliuered, like contrarietie of hearers hath alwayes followed, not onely in iudgement, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in their affection. For as ſome through the mercie of God and the ſincere preaching of the Goſpel, haue yeelded obedience to his worde: ſo many, caried away with corrupt teachers, haue for want of iudgement embraced errour in place of trueth, and carnall worſhippings, in ſteade of the pure worſhip of God, which euermore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth <note place="margin">Iohn. 4. 24.</note> in ſpirit and trueth. Againſt this ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous infection of falſe teachers, the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Saint Iohn hath giuen vs a moſt wholeſome counterpoyſon: willing vs not to beleeue euery ſpirit, but to trie and examin the ſpirits whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 4. 1.</note> they be of God. But (to ſpeake of our times) this examination and trial may ſeeme very hard, ſeeing the teachers on both ſides are thought learned, and al pretend to teach the trueth. For, it is not denyed but both ſides haue had their education in ſchooles of learning, they haue alſo laboured in the liberall artes, to furniſh them ſelues to greater matters: wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they al bring very good words, ſome ſhewe of reaſon, &amp; ſeeme to haue no ſmall force of perſwaſion. Howe then ſhall the ſimple people iudge, howe ſhal they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, whoſe iudgement and diſcretion ſhould be framed by their teachers, and ſetled by their
<pb facs="tcp:11418:3"/>
ſownd, and plaine doctrine? To this I anſwere, S. Iohn in that place maketh the matter more eaſy then it appeareth at the firſt ſhewe. For, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting vs not to beleeue euery ſpirit, he doeth drawe our conſideration to the ſpirit and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the teachers, and not to theſe outwarde giftes of an eloquent ſtile, or a ſweete ſownde of pleaſing wordes, which may be common to good and euil: yea wherein the euil, for want of a good cauſe labour to excell, and from which the godly abſteine for the ſufficiencie of their cauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, &amp; are alſo reſtrayned, leſt our faith ſhould ſtande in the wiſedome of men, and not in the <note place="margin">2. Cor. 2. 5.</note> power of God. But Saint Iohn, to make this his trial of ſpirits yet more ful &amp; plaine, addeth, that euery ſpirit which confeſſeth Chriſt Ieſus to haue <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 4. 2.</note> come in the fleſhe, is of God, and euery ſpirit which confeſſeth otherwiſe, is of Antichriſt. Now therefore, let vs ſee bowe the Apoſtle frameth vs to a ſpirit of diſcretion, to diſcerne the ſpirits of true and falſe teachers. If any man ſhall teach and conſeſſe that Chriſt was made man, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned of God the Father a Prophet, alone to teach: a King, alone to rule: and a Prieſt, alone to ſanctifie vs, and to reconcile vs to his Father by the obedience of faith, this confeſſion and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is of the holy ſpirit of God, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, what ſpirit ſoeuer ſhall mightily or cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly perſwade the contrary. On the other ſide, if any ſpirit ſhall teach that Chriſt is not our only teacher by his holy Goſpel, but that we muſt admit vnwritten beleefe and traditions, from we know not whom, to be of like authoritie with the written worde: ſecondly, if any ſpirit make not Chriſt alone our King and head to rule vs by his holy ſpirit, but teache that a mortall and ſinfull
<pb facs="tcp:11418:3"/>
man muſt ſit in our conſciences, and for hatred or gaine (which is his practiſe) bynde or looſe at his pleaſure: laſtly, if any ſpirit impeach the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiencie and entier vertue of Chriſts ſacrifice offered vp once for euer, &amp; teach that themſelues muſt renforce it from day to day by the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 27. &amp; 9. 12. 26. 28. &amp; 10. 10.</note> of their dayly ſacrifice of the Maſſe, offered for the quick &amp; dead: it appeareth manifeſtly, that ſuch ſpirits are not of God, nor their doctrine to be receiued, though it be deliuered with neuer ſo much perſwaſion of eloquent ſpeach, or offered to vs with neuer ſo much expectation of worldly honour. For, to denie the moſt abſolute vertue and effects of Chriſtes offices, is in effect to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the authoritie of his perſon, and to loſe the benefite of all his graces, becauſe they withdrawe a part. To this examination of ſpirits, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of perſons, the godly Reader is to be exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For the doctrine that giueth al glorie to God, is of God: the doctrine that attributeth ſome glory and aſcribeth ſome merites to man, is of men: the religion alſo that is agreeable to fleſh and blood, making an acceptable ſounde and ſhewe to the outward ſenſes, is carnall and vayne: finally, what religion ſo euer is not ioyned with the knowledge and exerciſes of the worde of God, that is no true religion, but a diſguiſed and blinde maſke full of deuiliſh ſuperſtition. The aduerſaries take a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary courſe in making triall of their doctrine: for they woulde haue this examination of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits vtterly ſuppreſſed, and vnder one title of that falſly named Catholique Church of Rome, they would bind all men to receiue for vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted true religion what corruptions ſo euer they teach, without any further queſtion. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing graunted them, the examination of ſpirits
<pb facs="tcp:11418:4"/>
neede not: for if Rome affirme it, the matter is ſufficient and muſt not be denied. Alſo theſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the trueth leaue the touchſtone, which tryeth al metalles, namely the doctrine, and for it they drawe the teachers into examination: ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that if they can diſcredit or diſgrace the men, they ſhall eaſily vndermine and ouerthrowe their doctrine. For triall of this long practiſe, there are ſo many bookes, that I neede not alleadge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but this late Cenſure written as in defence of popiſh religion: but the authour ſhifting his hands very cunningly of the direct and plaine mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the queſtions in controuerſie, doth but offer at them, or giue ſome falſe fire: his leauell and batterie is againſt their perſons and credit, that maynteining the trueth, cannot but aſſaile the doctrines, and put in hazarde the authoritie of the popiſh Church.</p>
            <p>Therefore I am in the name of the trueth to craue it of the good Reader, to lay aſide reſpect of men, &amp; the regard of thoſe giftes that may pleaſe him much; and deceiue him more: and if it be his deſire, not ſo much to ſee the fight, as to beholde the iſſue &amp; enioy the victory: then let him imbrace that doctrine moſt, that attributeth leaſt to the broken arme, or blinde iudgement of man, that in the Church al the power and wiſedome of our ſaluation may be aſcribed to God alone, through Chriſt Ieſus our Lorde.</p>

Campion or ſome other for him, that was more ready before hand, to deale ſomewhat with the anſwers made to his proud and ſeditious libel. For in a round ſtile this quareler would cary away the maintenance of an euil cauſe, and vnder the title &amp; authoritie of a Cenſurer, ratifie his manifold and vniuſt accuſations,
<pb facs="tcp:11418:6"/>
that ſo finally he may ſit downe to giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſentence againſt the truth. But for an anſwere to thoſe accuſations, and a repeale of his falſe ſentence, I mind to follow him, as from line to line, where iuſt occaſion is offered, that vpon examynation it may appeare, howe little force there is againſt the naked truth of Gods cauſes, in the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wordes of mans wiſedome.</p>
            <p>This Cenſurer taketh in hand the open defence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ieſuites ſeditious Pamphlet, and as a man of authoritie and iudgement, to cenſure my anſwere to it: but as he hath nor perfourmed the one, ſo hee hath greatly miſſed of the other.

The matters handled by the waye, as of the ſect and doctrine of Ieſuites, of Ed. Campi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons perſon, of diſputation, of Chriſtian

And becauſe you charge me with ordinarie rayling, I might fully requite you with placing your ordinarie and extraordinarie railings in one ranke, that you may knowe your owne, and take

them home. But I haue no ſuch purpoſe: and if I had, where you haue gathered my fit wordes againſt the wicked monkiſh fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or frierly monkes to fill tenne lynes, I might gather of your reproches more then can come into tenne leaues. Therefore I leaue it to the indifferent reader of your booke to iudge with what minde it is like you accuſed mee of rayling, that rayle ſo your ſelfe, or for want of modeſtie, you that haue beene ſo immodeſt and ſo bitter, or of abſurd aſſertions, you that haue ſo many.</p>
               <p>Concerning your charge, <hi>that I abuſe the Ieſuites thoſe learned men:</hi> I anſwere, that godlines is true learning, and the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foundation of good life, without the <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 7.</note> which, if they had any learning, or haue any ſhew of good life, the greater is their ſinne and hypocriſie, in imploying ſuch giftes of God to ſo vile a purpoſe, as the defence of manifeſt falſhoode and ſuperſtition. True it is, that the world doth knowe them, and ſuch as they bee: But it is a ſmall thing to be knowen or loued of the worlde: our ioye is, that God doth know his and maynteine <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 19. Pſal. 9. 4. Ier. 50. 34.</note> their right.</p>
               <p>That I call the Ieſuites a ſect (which you ſo finde fault with all) it is not my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:11418:10"/>
alone, but many haue done it before me and that learnedly, as ſhall appeare after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. But your definition is firſt to bee noted, as comming ſomewhat out of place and vntrue. Touching the place I will not contend, the matter cannot be iuſtified, in that you define <hi>Sectaries to be in deede ſuch as cut themſelues off in opinion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, from the general body of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church.</hi> For herein, as not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring your owne arte, you confound here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques with ſectaries, making no diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, betweene the generall and the ſpeciall: for (howeſoeuer the names are ſometimes confounded) in the receiued diſtinction of matter, all heretiques are ſectaries, but all ſectaries are not heretiques: ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diuers in nature, they cannot haue the ſame proper definition. Beſide your fault of confounding euen in a definition, which ſhould ſerue to diſtinction, and to bring cleere knowledge, this alſo is to bee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that of the two, it doeth moſt fitly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree vnto heretiques, whoſe ſinne &amp; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ſtandeth in cutting them ſelues off from the communion of the Church in opinion and doctrines of faith. Laſtly, though one man once diuide him ſelfe, and ſo be guiltie
<pb facs="tcp:11418:11"/>
in this particular of ſchiſme, yet by the word in common vſe, wee call it not a ſect, till there bee many drawen away. For if Layolas alone had troden that newe path, and vowed that ſpeciall vowe, for his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion and ſuperſtitious trade, hee alone ſhould not haue bene called a ſect. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your definition hath bewrayed great want of learning.</p>
               <p>But to giue you a truer definition, A ſect, according to the true etymologie of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> word, is a companie of men, that differ from the reſt of their religion, eyther in matter of forme of their profeſſion. Seing therefore the Ieſuites receiue a peculiar vowe to preache as the Apoſtles did, euery where, to do it of free coſt, to whippe and torment them ſelues after the example of a ſect called by the name of whippers, and <note place="margin">Chronica. chronic. fol. 21 5.</note> condemned long agoe: ſeeing they alſo as a diuided companie from all others, doe followe the rule of Layolas, it appeareth plainely, the Ieſuites are a ſect. As for the examples of Elias, Elizeus, Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, and Iohn Baptiſt, they are no leſſe wickedly then vnlearnedly alledged, to auow their order. What are you able to bring out of the woord of God, why Elias
<pb facs="tcp:11418:11"/>
ſhoulde after more then 2000. yeeres bee brought in for a patrone of Friers: What was in Elizeus or Daniel, that may liken them to Ieſuites: Iohn Baptiſt that may ſeeme to make moſt, maketh nothing at all for you: for it is to be thought hee was <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 15.</note> an extraordinarie and perpetual Nazarite, &amp; therefore his calling warranted him for his auſtere and extraordinarie attire and diet, which reſtraint or the like, is not nowe laid vpon thoſe that teach in the Churche; hauing all their ſeuerall offices expreſſed <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 6. 7, 8.</note> in the worde of God. Moreouer Iohns preaching in the wildernes of Iudea did not withdrawe him as is imagined, into ſolitarie and waſte mountaines, but the hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie part of Iudea was in compariſon of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, called a wilderneſſe, being not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding a countrey well inhabited, as appeareth in the booke of Ioſua.

                     </gap>5 61.</note> is cleere, that neither your definition nor examples can proue the Ieſuites to bee no ſect. Neuertheleſſe, as I haue anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red one definition with another: ſo will I anſwere your examples farre from the matter, with examples plainelie declaring that which is in queſtion. Saint Paul doth accuſe the Corinthes of Schiſme, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:11418:12"/>
becauſe they ſaid, I am of Paul: I am of <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 10. &amp; 11. 18.</note> Apollos: I am of Cephas: I am of Chriſt. Theſe did not cut themſelues off in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of religion, they did not holde a ſeueral faith to themſelues: but for this Schiſme hee ſharpely rebuked them, ſaying, Is Chriſt deuided: Therfore the Ieſuites, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> like, or in more wicked ſteppes, receiue ſentence from Saint Paule, wherein they are accuſed of Schiſme, and condemned as a ſect. For do not theſe vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Rome, do not theſe irregulars ſay, I am of Auſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I am of Frauncis, I am of Dominick, and theſe laſt men, I am of Ieſus: Is Ieſus then diuided: or not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you diuided ye Ieſuites, being cut off as heretiques from the myſticall body of Chriſt, and rent as Sectaries in your own bowels: Alſo the Phariſes are an other example to ouerthrowe your definition, &amp; <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 2.

For they did not cut off themſelues from the religion of the Church, yet for their ſeuerall order they were a notorious ſect.</p>
               <p>As I haue plainely ſhewed, that the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites are a ſect, ſo it is true, that they are a blaſphemous ſect. For what a blaſphemy
<pb facs="tcp:11418:12"/>
is it to abuſe the moſt bleſſed name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, for a colour to their blaſphemous prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, in rooting out the pure and ſincere preaching of the Goſpell, that afterwarde they may bring in all the execrable ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions &amp; hereſies of Poperie, and after many outrages, eſtabliſhe againe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable yoke of Antichriſt: This alſo increaſeth the offence, that they drawe to themſelues alone, the moſt gracious and comfortable title of our fellowſhip and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Chriſt Ieſus, which is common to <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 6.

Wherefore, howſoeuer the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie went neere the heart, and made you complaine, for me to call the Ieſuites a blaſphemous ſect, was neither <hi>lewd nor vnlearned.</hi> It is one of your nothings to make a ſhew of ſomething, when you ſay, <hi>they call not themſelues Ieſuites, but the Societie of Ieſus:</hi> making a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on where none is, or if there hee any, it is made againſt the receiued ſpeach eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, and againſt your ſelfe, who, in calling them ſo often Ieſuites, doe by the practiſe allowe your ſelfe the libertie of that ſpeach, which you reprehend in mee.

Thus it appeareth, that vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two former propoſitions, the one falſe, the other doubtfull, the Cenſurer can make no true or cleare concluſion, that the Ieſuites haue a good warrant for their newe Apoſtleſhip.

ſuch a one: therefore the proteſtantes may bee aſhamed of their father and religion. The firſt propoſition is altogether falſe: for <hi>Luther</hi> is not our progenitour, nor the father of our faith. If he had offended, yet the trueth and profeſſors thereof are not guiltie, or thereby iuſtly touched in credit. The ſeconde propoſition is alſo falſe: for howſoeuer falſe witneſſes come in one vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another to ſweare againſt him, <hi>Martin Luthers</hi> worthy praiſe, ſhall continue in all ages: the Lord hath ſhewed him a token of <note place="margin">Pſal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thus the Cenſurer appeareth much more carefull, ſmothely to deliuer foule reproches, then to bring a good reaſon for maintenance of his cauſe.

Although the ſentence were true, yet woulde you not cenſure him that ſhould giue ſentence againſt your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holie father, according to <hi>Martin Luthers</hi> teſtimonie? Why then doe you thinke that we will any more admitte <hi>Lindan</hi> and his fellowes againſt <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> then you will admit him againſt the Pope?</p>
               <p>Therefore in alledging <hi>Lindan, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chleus, Hoſius</hi> and <hi>Xaintes,</hi> with ſome others, you commit many faultes without any gayne to your cauſe.

For although theſe witneſſes are daſhed in, to make a ſhewe in the margent, and to deceyue the ignorant readers that knowe neyther their names, nor their weake authoritie: yet the Cenſurer, if his name were well knowen, hath againſt vs as much credit in his owne cauſe, as <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> hath, or <hi>Hoſius,</hi> albeit hee was your great preſident in the Councill of Trent.

You haue in many places vſed the auouch at large, which Lawiers thinke vnlearned in their caſes, and oftentimes you cite bookes not to bee

But I thought on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to note your practiſe herein: nowe let vs returne vnto the matter. Martin Luther doeth neyther him ſelfe exclude Matthewe, Marke, or Luke, from beyng the Goſpel, neyther woulde he haue anye man barre the other writings of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles from that title, becauſe all that was written by the foure Euangeliſts, and what ſo euer the holy Apoſtles wrote be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in the newe Teſtament, all that is one Goſpel in ſubſtance, though there be foure whoſe ſeuerall bookes vſually are called foure ſeuerall Goſpels. Therefore to ſpeake of the foure Euangeliſts firſt, in reſpect that the holy Ghoſt vſed them as foure pennes, and foure witneſſes, all wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Goſpel and ſtorie of the doctrine <note place="margin">Act. 1. 2.</note> and deedes of Chriſt: we may ſay there are foure Goſpels. But in reſpect they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>te in an heauenly harmony, in one Spirite, in one trueth, for one and the ſame woorke of faith, the Goſpell being one and the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:11418:26"/>
in all foure, there are not foure, but one Goſpell. As for the reſt of the Apoſtles, what they haue left to the treaſure of the Church in the booke of God, that alſo is the ſame Goſpel, and the Apoſtle doth call <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 16. &amp;. 16. 25. 1. Theſſ. 1. 5.</note> his doctrine and Epiſtles by that name: which is to be obſerued for auoyding a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt iudgement, in thinking leſſe authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or maieſtie of Goſpell in the Epiſtles, then is in the bookes of the foure Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts: for in reſpect that they were ſent from the Apoſtle, to the Churches abſent, they are called Epiſtles: as other mens letters are called in like caſe: but in reſpect of the doctrine therein deliuered, it is the ſame which ſaint Luke and ſaint Iohn did write, and beare no leſſe honour, howe ſo euer ſome cuſtome of ſpeach otherwiſe doeth hinder a right iudgement in this behalfe.</p>
               <p>To this thirde article onely hath the Cenſurer giuen his Cenſure, wherein hee hath not ſo much reproched Luther, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed ſome want of exerciſe or iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Scriptures. His wordes are that <hi>Luther ſaide this, becauſe the other three Goſpels ſpake too much of good workes:</hi> whereby the Cenſurers opinion is cleere, that Saint Iohn ſpeaketh leſſe
<pb facs="tcp:11418:26"/>
of good woorkes then the reſt. I graunt that Iohn hath a ſpeciall courſe in deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the diuinitie of Chriſt, and the loue of God towarde vs: but that hee is inferiour to the reſt in teaching good workes. I can not graunt it, neither can the Cenſurer proue it. But for proofe of that I ſay, one or two places of many may be ſufficient. If loue be the fulfilling of the Lawe, and the newe commaundement, not to loue <note place="margin">Iohn 13. 34.</note> one another, as euery man loueth him ſelf, but more perfectly and more aboundantly, as Chriſt hath loued vs: if to bring foorth much fruite, as branches in the vine, be the <note place="margin">Iohn 15. 2.</note> fountaine of euery good work: if to follow the ſhepheard Chriſt and to obey his voyce, <note place="margin">Iohn 10. 4.</note> be better then al ſacrifices: then Iohn doth moſt mightily teach the true doctrine of good woorkes.</p>

               <p>Your firſt reaſon, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> this place is not full ynough to proue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſufficiencie of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for which it is alleaged, ſtandeth vpon and word in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> text, where the Apoſtle ſaith, the Scripture is <hi>profitable,</hi> and hath not the worde <hi>ſufficient.</hi> But you ſay theſe are two diuers thinges, <hi>to bee ſufficient for a purpoſe,</hi> and <hi>to be profitable for it, as may appeare in meate which is profitable for our lyfe, yet wee cannot ſaye it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, becauſe it alone, without naturall heate, clothes and other meanes ſufficeth not.</hi> Whereupon you leaue the reader to conclude that this place is too ſlender for my purpoſe. The force of which your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is of the difference of theſe two words,
<pb facs="tcp:11418:54"/>
affirming that <hi>profitable,</hi> is not ſo much as ſufficient.

                  <hi>this life &amp; of the life to come:</hi> it can not be denyed, but by <hi>profitable</hi> here, he meaneth it is <hi>ſufficient</hi> for all things: that is for the obteyning of all good thinges: which ſenſe of this worde is prooued by that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth of the effect, <hi>hauing the promiſes of both lyues.</hi> For if godlineſſe bryng all good things of this lyfe and of the lyfe to come, it muſt needes folowe that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaying, it is profitable to all things, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode it was ſo fully ſufficient, that hee which hath it, needeth not the ſupplie of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing elſe. For like reaſon in this place, I ſay, the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as <hi>profitable for doctrine for confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb facs="tcp:11418:54"/>
for correction and reformation,</hi> by <hi>profitable,</hi> vnderſtandeth <hi>ſufficient.</hi> If your example were of the like, it woulde proue the ſame. If as meate and drinke are profitable to nouriſh, ſo they were profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble alſo to cloth, to giue reſt and to make a man perfectly healthie and ſtrong to euery good action: I woulde alſo conclude vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch cauſes that it were both profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſufficient to mayntaine life. But you ſtande in neede of an other Cenſurer, to Cenſure your compariſons and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſo often brought in, eaſily to dereyue the reader, that doth not ſee howe vnequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie they are yoked, as like thinges to make like proofe, being in deede vnlike and of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like effectes. To returne vnto the text, the ſufficiencie of ſcripture is moreouer proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the wordes which got before and followe. Before the Apoſtle had ſayde that <hi>all the Scripture is inſpired of God:</hi> whereupon he inferreth, <hi>and is profitable to teach for doctrine and confutation:</hi> as if he had ſayde, it is profitable to teache the trueth and reproue errour. The ſtrength of which reaſon lyeth in this, that the light of knowledge which ſometime was in man by his creation, is damped and gone out: ſo
<pb facs="tcp:11418:55"/>
that nowe wee haue no meanes (except God by his holy Spirite doeth inſpire vs) to diſcerne betweene trueth and vntrueth, or betweene good and euill. Nowe this heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly knowledge, which (as Saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſayeth) was vttered by the holy men of <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 21.</note> God, inſpired with the holy Ghoſt, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the bookes of holie Scripture. Whereupon it foloweth that theſe bookes of the holy worde, and no other, being the authenticall words of the heauenly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which God inſpired the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles withall, are ſo ſayde to be profitable to teache the trueth, as it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this to bee proper to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not to agree to any other whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer. Therefore if theſe bee the writings which contayne the wiſedome, wherewith God hath inſpired his holy men, for ſuch vſe of the Church, as is here ſpoken of, it muſt needes followe, the knowledge which God hath reuealed, being ſufficient for vs, that theſe holy Scriptures conteining the ſame knowledge, is lykewiſe ſufficient. Whereby it appeareth that this cauſe here noted, (to witte of <hi>inſpiration from God)</hi> being the proper cauſe of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and not common to any other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<pb facs="tcp:11418:55"/>
whatſoeuer, doeth implie the effect alſo folowing in this place, of teaching, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing and making perfecte the man of God, to be likewiſe proper vnto them: and (which I vndertoke to proue) <hi>profitable</hi> in this place to ſignifie as much as <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I adde an other reaſon out of the wordes which followe: wherein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not ſome things onely which may in parte make a man perfect, are attributed to the ſcriptures, and ſome other thinges left to bee ſupplied by other meanes: but all things whatſoeuer may bee needefull for vs, are ſayde to be perfected by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it muſt needes follow, that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone is ſufficient. For that which is profitable to al the partes, which may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to perfection, cannot be but ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the perfection of the whole: but that the Scripture is profitable in ſuch maner, the Apoſtle doth fully declare, both in rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all the particular partes which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, and adding alſo after generally, <hi>that the man of God may be perfect.</hi> To this purpoſe the Apoſtle hath ſo ſet his wordes, as hee could not more effectually by any other ſpeach. For he teacheth, that it
<pb facs="tcp:11418:56"/>
is profitable to make perfect, which yet is <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> made more full by the compound worde adioined, the grace and force of which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition (as was noted before) is to note perfection added to perfection, and to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <hi>throughly, or perfectly perfect,</hi> and that, as hee addeth, <hi>for all good workes.</hi> This is yet made more full and more waightie by that hee ſpeaketh not here of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon perfection of all men, but of the perfection of the <hi>man of God,</hi> that is of the Miniſter. If the ſcripture conteine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to make the Miniſter throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, for euery part of his office, both in doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine ſoundly to teach the trueth, and to confute and remoue error: and in life to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and correct that which is amiſſe, and to inſtruct in that which is righteous and holy, how much more is it ſufficient for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon knowledge of other men, in whom like perfection of vnderſtanding is not ſo much required.</p>
               <p>To theſe two reaſons, becauſe the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is of importance, I will yet adde one other out of the verſe next going before.

                  <hi>Chriſt Ieſus they are of abilitie or of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or of ſufficiencie to make him wiſe to ſaluation.</hi> For the Apoſtle ſayeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely, that the Scriptures are able, or of power, or ſufficiencie (for all theſe ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches I take to bee of one ſignification) whereunto: to make him wiſe: how farre: euen to ſaluation, that is to teache him all wiſedome needeful to ſaluation. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as I ſayd, the Apoſtle immediatly brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in this ſentence, that <hi>All the Scripture is giuen by inſpiration of God, and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for doctrine, &amp;c.</hi> Which muſt either be ſayde to bee impertinent to the former matter of the power or ſufficiencie of the Scripture to ſaluation (which I thinke no man of any reaſon will affirme) or els it muſt be confeſſed, that the Apoſtle added it for greater plainnes, or for an other proofe. For whether of both it be brought in, it is abſurde to bring the leſſe to ſet out, or proue the more. And ſeeing the Apoſtle had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the former verſe of the ſufficiencie
<pb facs="tcp:11418:57"/>
of Scripture, to ſaye nowe it bringeth but ſome profite to that purpoſe, were to ſaye leſſe then he had ſaid before. Wherefore he ſaying it is profitable, ſetteth it out as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone and ſufficiently profitable, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired of God, and ſanctified by his promiſe and ordinance, to make perfect the man of God to al heauenly wiſedome. Finally, the Apoſtle hauing put into Tiniothies hande al compleat, neceſſarie and ſufficient furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſpeaketh neuer a whit of your church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuealed verities, but onely of the ſcripture inſpired of God. Therefore either he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth and concludeth inſufficiently: or els the Scripture is ſufficiently, wholly, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully, and in trueth onely profitable.</p>
               <p>For your ſecond reaſon, I denie that the newe Teſtament is therefore ſuper fluous, becauſe the olde was ſufficient. For this bountifull addition, or acceſſe of ſcripture by the Newe Teſtament, is not to impeach the perfection and profitable ſufficiencie, or ſufficient profitablenes of the olde Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeeing the Fathers were aſwell fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as we are now vnder the Goſpell, but for a more full, euident, and cleare reue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therfore what cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhoulde hope haue to feare: True it is that neither fayth nor hope is ſo perfect in vs, but that in theſe reſpects you name, we often feare: but this feare is no woorke of hope, no more then doubt is a woorke of fayth. For to ſay that hope feareth in ſome reſpects, is as much as to ſay, faith in ſome reſpectes doubteth and is no faith. We doe both doubt and feare, ſuch are our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: but that we doubt, it is not of fayth, but of vnbeliefe: neyther doe we feare, as you ſpeake of feare, by any effect of hope, but by the contrary worke of deſperation. But after ſo many and ſufficient reaſons <note place="margin">Iam. 1. 6, 7, 8 Mar. 19. 23. 24.</note> out of the worde to prooue this queſtion of importance, the woordes of the Cenſurer offer one not to be neglected.

Therefore this your tradition is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the word of God. Further alſo, what is more manifeſt againſt the woorde of God then the doctrine of deuils? The Lent faſt, as you commaunde to keepe it, for conſcience ſake, forbidding meates cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated <note place="margin">1.

<pb facs="tcp:11418:82"/>
is plainly called a doctrine of deuils. Furthermore your opinion is playnely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to be with this diſtinction: <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall traditions are of no greater au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie then the writings and other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Church:</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are of no leſſe authoritie then if they had bene written by them, or then are the other thinges which they wrote:</hi> This is confuſedly taught and needeth yet more plaineneſſe: for not all orders deliuered by the Apoſtles, are to bee kept perpetually and vnchangeably, of like authoritie with the doctrine of the Goſpell, which they preached. The Apoſtolique doctrine is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall, ſubiect to no varietie of perſons, of times or places: but ſome traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that is, ſome orders are altered, as that in the acts, where they commaunde to abſteine from ſtrangled and from blood: for it appeareth <note place="margin">Act. 15. 29.</note> that the Apoſtles commanded not this for a perpetuall order, alwayes inuiolably to be obſerued, but onely for a time to auoids offences: which cauſe ceaſing, the order or tradition was no longer in force. Againe, ſome orders might be ſet downe by them for comlineſſe, which yet were not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued as neceſſary partes of ſaluation, nor
<pb facs="tcp:11418:83"/>
yet to remayne for euer in that forme or kynde: and therefore can not be matched with the Apoſtolique doctrine of fayth, which is euer al one, and which whoſoeuer beleeueth not, cannot bee ſaued, Nowe <note place="margin">1.

Therefore your Cenſureſhippe dyd well to adde, <hi>If they be certaynly deſcended from Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</hi> But how can this I pray you be certaynely knowen, but by the holy writings: can any other cuſtome or teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie aſſure your conſciences what came vndoubtedly from Chriſt, or what from his Apoſtles: Is there any one of your tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions that you can vouch to deſcend from ſo ſufficient authors, otherwiſe then by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of inſufficient witneſſes: What is it then for you to boaſt of <hi>inuincible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to proue diuers doctrines not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but left by woorde of mouth onely, whereas you bryng nothing but counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feyt Couneils, erring Fathers, fabulous

ſtories, and Apocrypha ſcriptures. This is right the bragging Apoſtle, and a ſhewe of the vaine chalenger. Yf a man coulde be feared with the guilte of your armour, or with your plume of feathers, you woulde bee a worthie champion, wounding more with a vayne feare; then with the force of your ſhrinking arme. In this encounter of al your profes, you haue ſorted out two: the firſt is out of that excellent chapter to the Theſſalonians, conteining a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie <note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2. 15.</note> and reuelation of Antichriſt. For an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to which place it is firſt to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode, that the worde <hi>Tradition</hi> in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſpeach, commeth as it doth in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, of a verbe <hi>to deliuer,</hi> ſo that whatſoeuer y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Apoſtle deliuered to the Churches, thoſe were the traditions hee lefte with them. Therefore I denie that Paule doth in any place by tradition ſignifie any vnwritten veritie, but that as in other places, he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth the doctrine of the Goſpel, which in the ſundrye partes thereof he deliuered. This appeareth apparauntly by the place ſo cited for your purpoſe, without regarde of any more then the worde <hi>Tradition.</hi> For in the verſes nexte before, the Apoſtle ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention of the Theſſalonians faith to
<pb facs="tcp:11418:84"/>
the trueth, ſaying, God hath called you <note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2. 13. 14.</note> thereunto by our Goſpell, to obteyne the glory of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon inferreth this concluſion: now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brethren ſtand faſt, &amp; holde the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which you haue learned, eyther by worde or by our epiſtle. Whereby it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth, that the traditions or thinges deliuered by him, partly by word, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by writing, were the diuers partes of the Goſpell which hee had taught them. Wherefore the written woorde affordeth you no proofe for vnwritten verities. The ſeconde is of doctrines, which you ſay, wee holde not by record of writing, but by word of mouth from Chriſt and his Apoſtles: as for example, baptiſme of infants, celebratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Sunday, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> number of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bookes of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; the faſt of Lent. If this be not hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and confounding of things together of vnlike ſort, I knowe not what may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led confuſion. For what order is it (to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Cenſurers occaſion y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which was noted in the fourth article) to match the baptiſme of children with the faſt of Lent: The one being by plaine argument gathered out of the worde, as namely out of the wordes of the conenant, I will bee
<pb facs="tcp:11418:84"/>
thy God and the God of thy ſeede, and <note place="margin">Gen. 17. 7.</note> thy children after thee for euer. This coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt dyd appertayne to both a like, to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham and his ſeede: whereunto the ſeale and practiſe was adioyned in circumciſing infantes of eyght dayes, as well as Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <note place="margin">Ibidem. 17. 10.</note> of great age, and that by expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God. Thus the doctrine is ſo prooued out of the written worde, as that no doubt remayneth. Nowe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was the ſacrament or ſeale of that <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note> righteouſneſſe which is by fayth, as Saint Paul teacheth: wherein it is equall our baptiſme. But this is your great learning; when you are not able for your ignorance, to prooue a doctrine out of the written worde, to ſay, we haue it by tradition, and by worde of mouth from the Apoſtles. Now your Lent faſt as you vſe it, hath not onely no grounde out of the worde, but is agaynſt the worde as I prooued before. If this bee your methode and diſcretion, I maruell not if good order be huddling and confounding in your accompt. For the number of the bookes, and for the Lordes day, I myght likewiſe make proofe out of the worde: ſo that if you can bring vs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by worde of mouth from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<pb facs="tcp:11418:85"/>
but your <hi>Lent faſt,</hi> your letters of credence will not ſerue you to be deleeued.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde Cenſure is that the place alleadged by me to confuce the aucthoritie of traditions, ſhould be impertinent. This the Cenſurer woulde ſhewe by three diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences betweene it and this purpoſe. Firſt, of the diuers cauſe of thoſe traditions, which our Sauiour Chriſt inueyeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, whereof they had beene authors to them ſelues, and of theſe which he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to deſcende from Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. But as in deede the difference woulde be great if this were true, ſo being falſe and vntrue as it is, it can make no difference at all. Theirs were in deede ſuch as they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, and though you deny it, ſo are yours alſo. For which of all your traditions came eyther fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt or from his Apoſtles? whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you proue them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either of them, your dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ſhall be allowed. Secondly, you ſay <hi>Chriſt reprehendeth not al obſeruation of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but the naughtie obſeruing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> which was, as you affirme, in that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Phariſes <hi>eſteemed them more then Gods word, &amp; brake it for the keeping of them,</hi> which you condemne. This alſo, if it were true, were a ſufficient difference: but it is
<pb facs="tcp:11418:85"/>
vntrue that our Sauiour Chriſt reproued onely the eſteeming of them more then Gods commaundementes. It can not bee denied, but he reprooued this in them in the ſame chapter before: but in the woordes alleadged, <hi>You worſhippe mee in vaine,</hi>

Alſo it commeth to bee noted howe you huddle the karuer of an image that is curſed, with a printer: and an image that is an abhomination, with the holy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: as if it were all one to make an image of God, and print the worde of God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly (being herein co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to your ſelf,) you vndertake to proue that creatures may be worſhipped, and, as if the matter were

out of doubt, you demand what <hi>we will ſay to the worſhip done vnto the Arke, vnto the Cherubins, vnto the Serpent of braſſe.</hi> For ſome ſhewe of proofe you alledge the fiue &amp; twentieth of Exodus, &amp; the 45.

In the place of Exodus there is no woorde leading vs to worſhippe, but onely a commandement of making the Arke, and the Cherubin of ſuch faſhion as is there preſcribed. If wee condemned all vſe of grauing or painting, this myght haue ſerued your turne: but ſpeaking only againſt your worſhipping of creatures, it maketh nothing againſt vs, or to iuſtifie your idolatrie. The place of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid doth not ſhewe what we muſt worſhip, but where we muſt worſhippe, euen at the footeſtoole of the Lorde with all humilitie, being there proſtrate vpon the ground, and humbled before him. The other two places of Numb. the 21. and Iohn 3. are brought <note place="margin">Num. 21. 9. Iohn. 3. 14.</note> by you to proue the worſhippe of the braſen ſerpent.

<pb facs="tcp:11418:88"/>
ſhould receiue their health. Now, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to looke vpon a thing be to worſhip it, here is no place at all to prooue that you ſaye. If you had cited the place out of the kinges, there is a cleare teſtimonie, that the braſen Serpent was worſhipped: but it made not for your purpoſe, ſeeing good Ezechias in the ſame place did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore breake it downe becauſe it was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped. <note place="margin">2.

But this place and that of Iohn were anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the ſixt Article. The ſecond to the Philippians ſheweth a great iudgement and ſkill in you: it is there written thus of Chriſt: <hi>God hath exalted him, and giuen</hi>

                  <hi>him a name which is aboue euery name, that at the name of Ieſus euery knee ſhould bow, of things in heauen, of things on the earth, and things vnder the earth.</hi> Hereupon you gather, firſt that the name of Ieſus is to be worſhipped, ſo as at the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it, we ſhould bow our knees. Now, if this bowing be due to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſound of a name, <hi>which is but a creature,</hi> then in your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſome creature is to bee worſhipped:
<pb facs="tcp:11418:88"/>
and ſo conſequently ſuch as your Cenſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhall appoint.

For, prouing that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſtandeth with obedience to magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, which you tall temporall obedience, you muſt needes conclude that your Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh religion is no religion, becauſe it ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth off this yoke of ſubiection layed vpon vs by the worde, and bringeth in a forraine ſupremacie to rule and ouerrule all by his <note place="margin">Luke 20. 25. Rom. 13. 1. Tit. 3. 1.</note> vſurped power and moſt vngodly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Therefore, taking in hande to confute it, you haue in deede confirmed my general concluſion: that <hi>Papiſts can not teach or mainteine the pretended Catholike reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but they muſt be traytours to GOD and enemies to the State.</hi> But becauſe you bring euill argumentes to proue this good concluſion, I muſt examine them, and lay open that errour, which is ſecretly and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtically conueyed vnder a ſhew of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and true propoſitions. Firſt, to proue
<pb facs="tcp:11418:95"/>
my concluſion againſt God, hee affirmeth Poperie to be the Catholique faith, which is to craue and beg the cauſe, and to affirme the chiefeſt matter in queſtion. Your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes laide downe at large, will make this your order of diſputation more playne, and the errour more ſenſible. Your former reaſon is this: whoſoeuer calleth him an enemie to God, that mainteyneth Poperie, vttereth the reproch of an vncleane mouth: All profeſſors of the Goſpell ſo holde and ſo call the maynteyners of Poperie, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all profeſſors of the Goſpel vtter the reproch of an vncleane mouth. In this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the firſt propoſition is brought, againſt all art, to proue and ſhould it ſelfe be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: it is placed firſt and ſhoulde be placed laſt for the concluſion: for if hee could in a true argument proue and conclude that which is onely affirmed in the firſt aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the controuerſie were at an ende. Therefore you ſpeake in a purpoſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the trueth, &amp; not with arguments to proue your cauſe. Your ſecond argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is thus framed: Whoſoeuer ſpeaketh againſt thoſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> would bring in a doctrine, contrary to the Goſpell eſtabliſhed, condemneth the former noble princes of England, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Anſw<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11418:96"/>
ſpeaketh againſt them: therefore the Anſw. condemneth the former noble princes of England. I graunt the ſecond propoſition: but the firſt is ful of vntruth. For I ſpeake of the preſent eſtate and preſent practiſes among you: what is that to former ſtates and former proceedings? I ſpeake of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, and the Cenſurer doeth drawe it to princes: I ſpeake of them that dealt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the ſetled lawes, and he doth bring it as ſpoken againſt thoſe, that made and mainteined their owne lawes then in force. This one propoſition being ſo falſe, ran make no argument, but ſophiſticall for a ſhewe of trueth, when there is nothing in it but falſhode. Alſo the Ieſuites woordes haue an argument intended for him in this forme: what religion former princes from the conuerſion of the lande vnto our age, haue mainteined, that muſt not be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: but they haue mainteined Poperie: therefore Poperie muſt not be condemned. The firſt propoſition is falſe, for wee muſt liue by the rule of Gods worde, and not by the example of men, that may deceiue and <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 105. Ex. 23. 2.

But while you pleade the authoritie, and, as you account it, the Catholike regiment of ſome of thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt me, you ſpeake againſt your ſelf ſecretly, opening your heart to diſcouer what you thinke of other Princes ſince, and namely of her Maieſties authoritie, and lawes eſtabliſhing the Goſpel. This is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to diſcouer the counterfeit honour, and heartie hate to the preſent ſoueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. It followeth that I anſwere your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections to the ſecond part of my conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: whether I make all Papiſtes tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, becauſe they are of contrary religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that which nowe ſtandeth in force by the grace of God, and vnder her Maieſties bleſſed gouernement. What may be ſayde of all Papiſtes generally, I leaue it as a

queſtion, which I haue not vndertaken: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men haue, if you will looke into their reaſons.

               <p>In the wordes following you keepe on your courſe, prouing that which is graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and affirming that which ſhoulde bee proued.

Herein alſo ſtandeth an anſwere to your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde aſſertion, that by the fathers <hi>wee knowe which is the right meaning of the word of God,</hi> for as the authoritie of the worde is confirmed by the ſpirit, ſo are the interpretations thereof alſo. As man is not the author, ſo he is not the interpreter of the worde of God, otherwiſe then by the autoritie of the worde it ſelfe. This ſaint Peter proueth, making it a reaſon why no Scripture is of a priuate interpretation, becauſe it came not from man: but the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 21.</note> men of God ſpake as they were moued and caried with the holy Ghoſt: ſo that the holy Ghoſt doeth deliuer, and warrant, and interprete vnto vs the holy woord of God, expounding ſcripture by ſcriptures, and not leauing this high office to men, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then to miniſters conteyning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues within the faithfull ſeruice of their charge in their written and authenticall commiſſion. And you dare not ſay (who dare ſay much) y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> an interpretation is true, becauſe an ancient father hath it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath it according to a trueth, and the trueth according to the word.

The ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and vnfit miniſters we defende not, or any that may among ſo many be iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſed of looſenes: but the godly prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers receiue the teſtimonie of learning and godly life, euen their enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made iudges. Whereas you finde a place in the dialogue to commende Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites <hi>for great labour, diuine meditations, chaſtiſing of the fleſh and ſuch like,</hi> I anſwere there is an vſe and abuſe in ſome of theſe actions: you are charged with the
<pb facs="tcp:11418:118"/>
abuſe. The reſt, as your whippe and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie abandoning of Gods bleſſings, both are ſuperſtitions, as was noted before in a fitter place. You remember who complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that of all iniuſt men, they are moſt iniuſt, which when they doe moſt deceiue, <note place="margin">Cic. off. lib. 1.</note> and greateſt harme, they do it notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that they may be eſteemed good men. Againe, wherin you haue a ſingular grace, you taunt vs as that <hi>we can not well bee charged with ſuch faultes as you count vertues</hi> in the Ieſuites. True it is we wiſh not to be charged with the righteouſnes of <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 20.</note> Scribes and Phariſees, but ſeeke a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes that may exceede it, ſuch as ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the ſynceritie of a good conſcience <note place="margin">1.

               <p>The thirde and laſt exception is againſt Frankens conuerſion, as not ſtrong to prooue any thing, ſeeing you can preſſe vs with many examples for one, which is your franke and bould aſſertion. But if you cannot truely alleadge a man for a citie, or a towne for a kingdome, this is a note who it is that in deede dare venture vpon any aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, though all the worlde ſee the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and vntrueth thereof. In place of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye, two examples are brought in with
<pb facs="tcp:11418:118"/>
their pretended reaſons. But firſt you giue ſentence before the triall, that <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken departed from vs vpon a fancie,</hi> and <hi>your fellowes vpon great reaſons and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible proofes.</hi> For Franken I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, though I knowe he be not throwly cleanſed from the dregges of Poperie, but carieth ſome corruption that hath infected the hearte, (which you haue not at all bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him for) yet his reaſons of departure were ſuch as enforced him therunto, being otherwiſe ſuperſtitiouſly addicted and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to continue. Of your two men I can ſaie nothing, I knowe not what roote they had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that were ſo ſoone withered.

               <p>To come to your two rumiagates <hi>Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi> and <hi>Flaſchius,</hi> albeit you auowe
<pb facs="tcp:11418:119"/>

               <p>1 <hi>For what</hi> reaſon is the firſt, that <hi>Xilander</hi> giueth? <hi>The Catholiques haue endured theſe fifteene hundred yeeres in concorde of one doctrine, and 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſectes haue ſprong of Luther within theſe ſixtie yeres,</hi> therefore he departeth to you: Firſt this reaſon ſtandeth vpon two falſe, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten confuted aſſumptions: For neither hath the Popiſh Church endured ſo long, nor ſo many ſects ſo lately growne vp of Luther. Secondly, though the aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were true, yet the argument doth not followe. For if antiquitie might prooue a Church, the Iewes would make a great clayme to the title: If ſects ſpringing vp, prooue no Church, what ſhal we ſay to the Churches of God at Corinth and in Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia: <hi>Xilander</hi> did but ſalute our religion as paſſing by, that had no better reaſon of his falling away then this, ſo often and ſo many wayes confuced.</p>

Watſon in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the 2. ſermons printed anno. 1554.</note> charged <hi>no ſmall men</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>but our great biſhops,</hi> to ſay that <hi>euery man and woman, might at the Lordes table, take bread and bleſſe it</hi> (which he calleth tonſecration) <hi>and ſpeake the woordes of the inſtitution, aſwell as the miniſter.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb facs="tcp:11418:123"/>
here I am to aduertiſe the reader, that Papiſtes miſreport the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues now ſaying and at an other time denying the ſame, as appeared in many of the <hi>XIII.</hi> articles by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Cenſurers own practiſe. For when the Ieſuites are truely charged, he will not graunt that which is truely auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched againſt them, but changing the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will ſeeme to ſay leſſe then they teach. For one example they are charged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit idolatrie in worſhipping images: the Cenſurer will ſeeme to denie this, ſaying, <hi>they giue no worſhip to the image but to God:</hi> this diſtinction is not good: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more the aſſertion is falſe. For it hath been prooued that they giue worſhip to the very image of Chriſt: and, which is more, that they giue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> greateſt worſhip of Chriſt him ſelfe to his picture. Therefore al men are to conſider this both for our defence, &amp; to auoyde the errour that may come by their deceites. For in the fielde, where they ſtand in feare of the aduerſarie, and in their perſwaſions, when they would win a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyte, the pretended Catholiques will not lie open, but cloke a great part of their ſhamefull doctrine: which is their ſubtiltie to drawe away diſciples, and to leaue leſſe aduantage to their enemies. Therefore to
<pb facs="tcp:11418:124"/>
a man not acquainted with their double dealing wee may ſeeme to report them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, then they holde in diſputation, when notwithſtanding we report them no other wiſe then they openly teache in their kingdome, and publiſhe in their writings. Wherefore I may conclude that this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vpon a manifeſt vntruth: <hi>Xilander</hi> iudged of Iudas by the kiſſe, not <note place="margin">Luke. 22. 48.</note> by the treaſon.</p>
               <p>8 Laſtly for a reaſon we are falſely char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to eſteeme all our aunceſters damned: to breake their willes, and conuert to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane vſes, that which they gaue to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine idle Monkes and Friers, and to redeeme them by maſſes out of purgatory. Whatſoeuer he thought in him ſelfe, or i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined in others, wee thinke not our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſters damned: but leaue iudgement to <note place="margin">Iam. 4. 12.</note> the Lorde, to whom the iudgement of life and death doth belong: not ſearching out his ſecret cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſels which are vnſearchable. As for the orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which they beſtowed, not vpon the ſeruice of God, to the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſoules, by the preaching and miniſterie of the Goſpell, but vpon the great harlot and to the inlargement of her kingdome, they are brought home agayne to better vſes: and I thinke many of your
<pb facs="tcp:11418:124"/>
beſt friendes will holde and enioy them as better beſtowed.</p>
               <p>Your ſeconde man, commeth ready <note place="margin">Sebaſtian Flaſchius.</note> furniſhed to your hande out of the former booke of Lindan. But becauſe you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe not to deliuer the ſame reaſons that were touched before, let vs ſee how faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully you keepe art and promiſe. Flaſchius firſt reaſon is the ſame that Xilanders ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth: where they ſay <hi>we report the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts to teach that they teach not.</hi> Alſo his thirde is but a particular of that which the other man did generally auouch in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſixt <hi>againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly as vſing diſhoneſt ſpeach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſpeake of them particularly, Flaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius his firſt reaſon is, that your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques <hi>teach cleane contrary to that which we report of them.</hi> We report them to teach, that the Pope is ſupreame head of the Church, doe they teach the cleane contrary? we charge them to aſcribe ſome merit to workes, do they teach cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary? Againe we charge them that they auowe tranſubſtantiation, do they teach no ſuch thing: Wee moreouer chalenge them for giuing worſhippe to images, do they teach the contrary doctrine? wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them for denying the ſufficiencie of ſcriptures, do they make them ſufficient? <gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">

I might bring infinite ſuch examples, but theſe may be ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſhew how Flaſchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us ſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled at his firſt going out at the gace.</p>
