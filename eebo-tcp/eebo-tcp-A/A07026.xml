         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

credite hath continuance, and praise possession.

(which in the opinion of the Pope and his consistorie, is high treason, and vnpardonable,) that verie babes and sucklings may beholde their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations, and spitte at their vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous practises, to them selues ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantageable, to the church of Christ offensiue, and to the glorie of God nothing more derogatorie.

Therefore your Honour is highly to be praised for such noble actes: And eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man is duely bound herein, to assist &amp; further you in your enterprise, to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost of his knowledge &amp; abilitie.</p>
            <p>This (Right Honorable and blessed Bishop) is the cause, which hath moued me poore &amp; vnworthie brother of Saint <hi>Frauncis</hi> order, to dedicate and sende this my simple present to your honour, to the ende that I (with this my small gifte of good will) may somewhat (though but a little) helpe to strengthen &amp; repaire the decaied walles of the Romishe Church, and establish againe the right &amp; perfect foundation of our most holie father, the Pope. Therefore hauing a while agoe: seene &amp; marked that in the Citie of <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpe</hi> was a small booke sette foorth in French &amp; Flemish, intituled &amp; named <hi>A Letter Missiue:</hi> Or, <hi>An Epistle directed vnto the Apostates &amp; Backsliders, from the true Christian beleefe, compiled and made by Maister Gentian Heruet, &amp;c</hi>: And for that the same booke was greatly desired, and verie much esteemed of all good and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
<pb facs="tcp:20494:11"/>
hearts: I haue (with all diligence and circumspection) perused and read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the same: wherein I haue founde in effect, that in the same is briefly declared and set foorth the whole grounde and foundation of the holie Romish religion, which your Honour, euen with fire and swoorde, to the subuersion and vtter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of the whole land, doth seke most zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously to mainteine. And I am thereby persuaded, that the same booke was most worthie to be read ouer of all men, to the ende that all startbackes from the faith, might returne into the right way: and the good faithfull Catholikes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by strengthened &amp; confirmed. But nowe considering the saide booke to bee verie shorte, and something darke for a matter of suche importaunce, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise had either none or verie few proofes out of the Scriptures, Councels, holie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Decrees of the Popes: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue thought good to set penne to Paper, and to set foorth and declare the same at large, that nothing needefull should be lacking. Moreouer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering that it is most necessarie, to declare some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more at large, especially touching
<pb facs="tcp:20494:12"/>
the woorthines, and authoritie of the holie Churche of Rome, and the true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the holie Scripture: wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the summe of all our matters doe depende, for that we haue alwayes beene forced to call vpon the Church, &amp; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally now, when there is none other shield or defence left vnto vs: therefore haue I traueiled brieflie to shew of this matter, where the sure grounde and foundation lies, by what Scriptures, by what holie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by what Councels, &amp; by how many Decrees euerie point is defended: and likewise howe and in what manner the Scripture and the holie Church of Rome are ioyned together, and Catholikelie vnderstoode in suche order, as the same shall in no wise serue the Heretikes anie thing at al to their purpose or aduantage. And forsomuch as this woorke is sucked out of sundrie sortes of flowres gathered together: therefore haue I named it, <hi>The Bee hiue of the Romishe Churche,</hi> thereby to geue to vnderstande<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that as the honie Bee, doeth not gather her honie out of one flowre alone, but out of manie and diuerse: So doeth not the Churche of Rome stande vpon one Scripture, Byble,
<pb facs="tcp:20494:12"/>
Councels or bokes of Decrees, but doth catche and snatch out of eche of them, that which best serueth her purpose, as hereafter euerie man may plainelie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and in the ende of this booke shall vnderstande more at large, whereas the speciall causes are set foorth, why and wherefore we haue christened this booke with such a name. And now, hauing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode that your Honour did a good while agoe set foorth a certaine booke, against the confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the faith of these newe Gospellers, I did verie earnestly trauell to gette the same, trusting that it might (perhaps) haue eased me of this my labour, for that I thought your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour shoulde haue set foorth these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters there at large. But after that I had superficially and lightly reade ouer the saide booke, (not hauing the lucke to kepe the same lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g by me.) I was the more willing to set foorth this my <hi>Bee hiue,</hi> for that I sawe it shoulde serue verie well, to the opening and more plaine declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the foresaide booke, which your Honour hath made and published: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that your honour is busie in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie place with the aucthoritie and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
<pb facs="tcp:20494:13"/>
of the holie Churche, of her ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances or constitutions, additions, or tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ditions, and of the spirituall exposition, which shee hath made vppon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: &amp; perceiuing nothing to be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set foorth, whereby one may finde out these constitutions and ordinances, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Scripture, in the Fathers, in the Decrees, or in the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels: so that a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple man might alway stande in doubt, what you will haue esteemed and holden for the commaundementes ordinances, or traditions of the Churche, and what men shall call the Churche, and likewise what rule or inuiolable order this holie Churche doth commonly keepe and vse in the exposition of the scriptures, but I thinke your Honour did leaue this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, as our saide <hi>Maister Gentian Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet</hi> did, especially, because it was to small and slight a matter for you to trouble your mytered head with all. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue I gladlie taken vppon me this paine and trauell, and haue clearely sette forth in this my booke, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what ground and foundation all these thinges are buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: So that the necessarie vse of this booke is vnspeakeable as euerie good
<pb facs="tcp:20494:13"/>
Catholike shall well perceiue of him self. And forsomuch as herein is not written anie thing, but it doeth agree aswell, yea, better with the said booke made by you, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with <hi>Gentians</hi> booke, I would gladly haue it set forth, as an Exposition, Glose, or Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentarie vpon your foresaid pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie booke: but considering that I had not anie copie of your said booke in my cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodie, and fearing also least your Honor might haue bene offended, that any man should take vppon him to expounde or comment vpon your writings, which are as cleare as hellishe sunne, euen as your owne name <hi>Sonnius</hi> doth signifie: so that I haue proceeded with my first determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, thinking it sufficient for me, if I might hide this my trauell vnder the winges of your Honor, like as vnder the same, all our newe Bishops haue beene hatched. Most humblie beseeching your Honor, to accept this my simple gifte in good parte, and as becommeth such a worthie Bishop to do, trusting yet (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in short time) to set foorth more such woorkes, and thereby so preciselie to expounde all the bookes that are set out

by your Honour, and other doctoures of <hi>Louen</hi> your companions, that a blinde man may feele them with his handes: yea, and without spectacles or candle, conceiue what greate holines lies hid in such coafers.

            <p n="1">1 That the <hi>Heretikes</hi> and <hi>Huguenotes</hi> cannot repute them selues for faithfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, so farre forth as they do not beleeue all things, which our louing mother the holie Church beleeueth, without whom no salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be obteined: &amp; especiallie, for that they will not beleeue the Transubstantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the breade into the verie bodie of Christ.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The second is knitte to the first: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: They mainteine iniuriouslie, that wee ought to allowe nothing, but what is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined by Scripture.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Thirdlie: They doe not beleeue nor
<pb facs="tcp:20494:15"/>
allowe of seuen Sacramentes, especiallie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Auricular confession, the sacrament of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie, and the holie ointment of Vnc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Fourthlie: They doe the Catholikes great iniurie: insomuch as they repute them for idolaters and worshippers of idols.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Fifthlie: They seeke nothing else, but fleshlie libertie, and their owne appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Sixthlie &amp; lastlie: Their Preachers are vnlearned Doultes, and leade a lewde, loathsome, and wicked life.</p>
            <p>In these sixe pointes is brieflie rehearsed the whole grounde and foundation of the holie Catholike doctrine, taught by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishe Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is so gallantlie establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: yea, and all the Heretikes so finelie fetche ouer the coales, that there remaineth not a iotte to be spoken of anie further.

               <p>But nowe, to come to our matter againe, it is necessarie, that we well consider, and substantially declare, wherein the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and authoritie of the holy Church doth specially consist: &amp; what commandements, traditions, and ordinances of the same, men must receyue and accept, without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction or gainsaying.</p>

besides so many traditions of idle heades, which the holy Church of Rome hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued for a perfite seruing of God: as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting dayes, yeares of grace, differences and diuersities of dayes, of meates, of clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, consecrating of Churches, of altars, of candles, pilgrimages, Letanies, <hi>Kyrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elesons,</hi> Images, Processions, holy ashes, holy Paceegges, and flanes, palmes and palme boughes, Albes, Copes, Maniples, Vestme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, Miters, Staues, fooles hoods, Shelles, and Belles, Paxes, licking of rotten bones, carying of the Pixe about, and praying to a lumpe of doaw, fasting vpon certaine speciall dayes, creeping vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on knees before a Crosse of wood, buying of Bulles and pardons, mumbling of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nosters</hi> and <hi>Aue Maries,</hi> by tale, vpon a paire of Beades, before a dumbe image, shauing of crowne and beard, to giue bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with two fingers: and ten thousande more such prankes.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Knight brethren.</note> the <hi>Knights of S.

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20494:41"/>Nay, I dare saye, that if the Apostles had but once seene, or hearde, the hundred part of these new religious orders and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions named, they would haue bene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide of them. For, seeing that S. Paule could not suffer, that amongst the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> some should call them selues the Disciples of <hi>Peter,</hi> other of <hi>Paule,</hi> the thirde of <hi>Apollo:</hi> howe would he then haue bene afraide, and out of quiet, when he should haue seene or hearde, of such an innumerable companie of newe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers names, professions, religions, Gods seruices, and rules of perfection: whereof some were clad and apparelled in blacke, some in white, some in gray, some in green, some in blewe, some in red, some in furres, and in all maner of diuers colours: and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one of them did esteeme his owne order and rules for the best, and most worthie to be regarded. He would surely haue thought him selfe to haue bene come into a newe world. Therefore it is a great follie, that men will founde them selues onely vpon that, which the Apostles haue taught or written: considering that the world is now chaunged, and that the holy Church hath found out and established newe religions,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:20494:41"/>
newe commandements, and newe articles of our faith, whereof the Apostles neuer knewe. For otherwise (beleeue me) if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els were estemed but the bare Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and writings of the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, then should all the Decrees &amp; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretalles, all good holy Ordinances of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> all the goodly Councelles which haue bene kept and holden, by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and commandement of the Popes: yea, all the before specified orders and religion of Friers &amp; No<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, the Heremites, Gildes and Knighthoods, be vtterly ouerthrowen: yea, all their merites and supererogations, would not be worth an Oaten cake, if men should begin to esteeme and accept the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture alone, for a true and sufficient rule and direction: and then should <hi>Luther</hi> haue done well, when he caused the decrees and de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>O, no, truely, We must aboue all main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine those in reputation: yea, euen in greater estimation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It is sinne against the holye Ghost, to do any thing against the Popes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.</note> 
                  <hi>than the woorde of God it selfe: for who soeuer doth sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the word of God, his sinnes maye be forgiuen him: but he that doth sinne against the Decrees of the Pope, doeth sinne against the holy Ghost, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

his offence shall neuer be forgiuen him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, it is vndoubtedly a great o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersight of them, that would compasse and pale in the holy Church with the bounds of the holy Scripture, seeing she may steppe or leape ouer it with a staffe, or without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie feare: and as often as euer she wil.</p>
               <p>Yet it is true, that sometimes shee doeth helpe her self with the scripture: for if there were no scripture, howe should one knowe whether there must be a Church or no: or wherby should a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> discerne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true church of God from the church of Antichrist? Yet doth she alway rule the Scripture, &amp; makes therevpon such a glosse, as best serueth her turne: yea, that is more, she is the very oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion that any beleefe or credit is giuen to the scripture: as is pleasantly set foorth by the holy and right honourable Bishoppe <hi>Guilielmus Blindasinus,</hi> in his booke cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Panoplia:</hi>

the power of the holy Ghost, if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did not first giue her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicte in the matter? No marie, I warant you: for so the Heretikes do vnderstand it. For these Heretikes will bring the church of God in subiection vnder the scripture: &amp; therefore do they alledge out of Ieremie, That the word of God is like a fire,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.34. <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.19.</note> shal lightly know (by inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Ghost) whether the doctrine be of God. They say likewise, It doth giue light to al things: for it is a lampe to ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the feete of the beleeuers: whereby they must walke through the darknesse of this world: &amp; they say, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mans wisdom &amp; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, how great, howe wise,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 19. <hi>Psa.</hi> 119.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>3</note> howe holy soeuer the same can be, is plain darkenesse, in comparison thereof.</p>
               <p>Well then, if it be so, that the darkenesse can not lighten the light, but that the light
<pb facs="tcp:20494:43"/>
it selfe must lighten all things, then in very deede can not the worde of God receiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie light of the opinion or authoritie of man: but it selfe must be the light, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men may knowe, which is the Church of God, and which is the Synagogue of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblers. And therefore they conclude ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the worde of the Prophet Esaie, That men must followe after the Lawe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Esai.</hi> 8.20.</note> and the witnesse, which is, the writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word of God: and that whosoeuer doth not walke after that, shall neuer see the daye spring. But, as I haue alredy said, all that is plain heresie: for our dearely beloued mother the holy Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will be chiefe Iudge her selfe ouer the holye Scripture. So that the doctrine of the Prophetes &amp; Apostles, is now no more the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, as it was in the time of Paul: but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2.20.</note> the Church, with the authoritie &amp; the traditions of the same, is the onely founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Scripture. For euen so might the Iewes before time aduance themselues likewise, by the estimation &amp; authoritie of the Church, alledging that the law and the witnes, whereof y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet speakes, could haue bene of no estimation, but by reason, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same was consented to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Church:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:20494:43"/>
and that men should neuer haue knowen, neither the Lawe, or the witnesse, or Gods worde, if it had not bene by them, and their forefathers set forth &amp; declared, what they should accept for Gods worde: and that the Church with her light hadde lightened the Lawe and the witnesse. And so the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doeth nowe also saye, That the worde of God hath no estimation, but that which it hath borrowed of the Church: for otherwise (as shee sayeth, and as all good Catholike writers do declare) howe should we knowe, that the scripture were the word of God, if it were not that the holy Church had so allowed and iudged it? Wherefore should we more beleeue the Gospel of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewe, or Marke, than the Gospell of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chodemus, or Thomas? For there standes plainly written in the Decrees, That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the old nor the newe Testament were receiued of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for this cause, or that cause:<note place="margin">

Therefore yee maye well thinke, that God could not plant and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishe his holy worde in mens heartes, by
<pb facs="tcp:20494:44"/>
the inspiration of his spirit (as <hi>S. Iohn</hi> the Apostle would proue) if it were not that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Church had therein holpen him.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>because that Pope Innocentius hath ordeined &amp; iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: so it doth necessarily folow, that the Decretalles of the Popes of Rome, must likewise be receiued &amp; accepted: the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that Pope Leo hath likewise or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined, That whosoeuer doth set him self against them, his sinnes shal neuer be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen him, &amp;c.</hi> It is very true, that by this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it must likewise folow, that all the Iewes <hi>Caballes</hi> &amp; <hi>Talmood,</hi> and all their dreames, must as wel be receiued, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fiue bookes of <hi>Moses,</hi> &amp; the bookes of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.

allowe the Iewes writings, and seale, so must wee also, (following the rule of our Doctours of <hi>Louen</hi>) beleeue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> said Iewes, in all that they say and teache: and thereby nowe shoulde our Romishe Church come short home.

               <p>Also there followeth out of the same, that the common sort of people may be as well instructed in the knoweledge of God, by dumbe Images, and mumming represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as by the preaching of the Gospel: and that men must as well christen the Belles at the Font, as the children whiche are shapen after the likenesse of God, and bought by the precious bloud of Iesus Christ: that in baptising shall be vsed spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and oyntment, as well as water: that the holy Sacrament shall bee caried about the streetes in the Procession, with Baners and Pipes, as well as it shall be taken and eaten in the Congregation of the faythfull, in remembrance of the death of the Lorde.

               <p>But (beleeue me) the holy fathers, and the Pope, were not so foolishe: they did see more deepely into the matter.

               <p>THis same must be vnderstoode of all the former decrees, and canons of all the Popes deceased. For although it be cleare, that they are inspirattons of the holy ghost, against which it is not lawful for any man to speake: so as whosoeuer doeth despise them, is voide of the Catholike and Apostolike beliefe: yet that notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, they cannot therefore by any meanes close or shut vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authoritie of the Church. And wherfore? For that there is one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rule of the holy Church set foorth, for an vndoubted article of our fayth, which is, That the Romish church is she, which doth giue to all Popes decrees, their full power and might: prouided alwayes, that she her selfe, is not in any wise subiect to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, by reason that she hath a ful power always to make such decrees and ordinances, when
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:20494:65"/>
soeuer it shall please her, as hauing power, and being heade ouer all Churches, from which poynt no man maye dissent. So, after this manner, doeth shee giue and graunt to the decrees,<note place="margin">Popes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.</note> full power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, with this exception, <hi>That she her selfe will in no wise, incline or yeelde to the same: but that she may do any thing agaynst the same, whensoeuer it shall please her.</hi> Euen like as Christ did teach the people, as hauing might, authoritie, and power of himselfe, and not like vnto the Theologians, or Phariseis, whiche durst neither put to nor diminishe or take from the same. And euen after this maner it followeth with the Popes. They giue the decrees their authoritie, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this may they do (as masters and Doctours of the lawe) euen when they list, agaynst their owne lawes and decrees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore the decrees and Canons doe not conclude anie thing at all, without this exception, <hi>That the Churche of Rome may alway vnderstande, interprete, and expound the same, as she shal think good.</hi> And herevpon it commes to passe, that in all decrees, one of these tales is ioyned, to wit, <hi>Reseruing alway the right and title

For they would (vndoubtedly) teare them in pieces, with their teeth, and swallowe them vp whole haire and hide, euen as they do with their god: Or if it were so, that they could not well bring that to passe, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that the Heretikes are more heauie to digest, than their god in the Masse is, then there would come to helpe them, Maister <hi>Deane Romist,</hi> the Procurour Generall, with a great companie of Catchpolles, &amp; hangmen, with staues and stakes, with fire and sworde, with strawe and fagottes, and would set them on fire, and so burne them vp by clusters: and then their disputing were at an end.

                  <p>NOwe, as concerning the first part, our famous Doctours and <hi>Licentiates</hi> of <hi>Louen</hi> &amp; <hi>Paris,</hi> do ioyntly teach,<note place="margin">This did the Catholike doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours set forth openly at <hi>VVorms,</hi> anno 1557.</note>

                  <p>Nowe, that spites them out of measure:
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:20494:91"/>
and to saye trueth, howe can they tolerate or suffer such a thing? yea, when al is said, what mischiefe do these Heretikes meane, that they thinke them selues wiser than all the holy Fathers, the Popes of Rome? with so manie Cardinals of excellent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme, and honourable Bishops, with such innumerable bandes of learned men of <hi>Louen</hi> and <hi>Paris?</hi> Or if so be likewise, that they doe not passe for all their My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Staues, Hattes, Crownes, Cowles Capes, and Liripippes: yet must they needes remember them selues, that holie Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, nowe lately dead, did in the confession of the faith, which he with the consent of the whole Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> published and set foorth, euen as a watche woorde or speciall marke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men might discerne true Catholikes from false Heretikes: as in plaine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse wordes is written.

For you doe heare, to beginne withal, that the worde of God is not of such value or dignitie, that it is of it self worthie to be beleeued: vnlesse it be deckte and set forth with the glosses and interpretation of the holie Fathers of <hi>Rome:</hi> So that hereof is to be gathered, as all Catholike Doctours also haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: <hi>That the Scripture and word of God is obscure, darke, variable, vncertein, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eeuen, rawe, vnfurnished, and vnhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some:

but the glosses and interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the holy father of Rome, and of the great Clerkes of Louen are cleare, lightsome, stedfast, sure, true, euen, plain, fullie furnished, and in all pointes verie handsome and sufficient.</hi> It is true, that the pretence of Christ &amp; of his Disciples, was to vtter &amp; declare to euerie man, their doctrine (or at least so much of it, as doeth apperteine to the saluation of man) in all plainesse, simplicitie, &amp; trueth, without any dissimulation or darknesse. For to that end &amp; purpose did Christ chuse simple fishers, and other plaine dealing laie people for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Euangelistes: and did therfore thanke his heauenly father, that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed his heauenly wisdome &amp; knowledge to simple &amp; plain mening men,<note place="margin">

                     <pb facs="tcp:20494:93"/>And yet notwithstanding, we must now either say, that their intent and meaning was not well grounded: or else, that the chaunce is now changed. For we see, that nowe in these dayes the Scripture is hid fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Laie people, as a thing dark, dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, &amp; of no sufficient foundation: in place wherof is intruded, &amp; thrust in the peoples hands, glosses, &amp; interpretations, decisions, and determinations of the holie Church: so that thereby it is good to consider, that the scripture is not only darke, but also rough, vneeuen, hard, &amp; stonie: in so much that the Catholike children of the church of <hi>Rome</hi> might lightly stumble vpon it, and breake their shinnes: or else perhaps be seduced &amp; drawne awry from their right Catholike beleefe. But the foresaid decisions, &amp; glosses are as eeuen,<note place="margin">Gloses as plain as rockes.</note> smooth &amp; plaine, as the rockes of <hi>S.

Therefore, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all things, we must sticke fast to their glosings, &amp; cleaue close to their interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; haue litle regard what the plaine &amp;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:20494:93"/>
cleare textes of the scripture bring with them. Now this is the first point that you haue to consider, out of the rule before spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. The second you may likewise ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of this: That no man in the world hath power to interprete the Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie otherwise than as hitherto it hath bene interpreted, by the holie Popes and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and by the Theologians &amp; Bache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of <hi>Louen</hi>: for else to what purpose were it, that men should bestow such cost on those same <hi>Magistri nostri,</hi> in making them pleasant bankets, to proceed Bachelers or Licentiats, if it were not that thereby they had free graunt and licence,<note place="margin">T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then we may thereby well perceiue, that suche as are neither Bacchelers, Licentiates, nor Doctours, presuming of their owne wit and will to set out the Scripture, according to the letter, that is to say, after the single and profound ground of the plaine text, &amp; so applie them to the detrime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the holy Romish church, are all ranke Heretikes: seeing they goe about to rob the holie Church of Rome, of her power &amp; authoritie: which is a thing in
<pb facs="tcp:20494:94"/>
no wise tollerable. For it is most true, and without doubt: yea, as true as the holie Gospell of the Distaffe: as is plainely to be proued out of the bookes of all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like writers, That when our Lorde Iesus Christ did deliuer into the handes of the holie Church of Rome,<note place="margin">The keyes of the kingdome of heauen.</note> the keyes of the kingdome of Heauen, he did yet giue her beside those an other string of sixe keyes, wherewith shee might open and shutte all the Cupbordes of the Scripture, euen as it pleased her, and as shee thought good for her owne aduauntage. And when as one key will not serue, she may proue another: In summe, and for a finall conclusion, so tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell in that behalfe, that she get the locke open. Foure of these keyes, most chiefe and principall are called <hi>Imperatrices,</hi> because they will open all the lockes in the house.</p>
                  <p>The first is called <hi>Expositio literalis,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Expositio lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>An interpretation according to the letter:</hi> which key our mother the holie Church hath least of all occupied: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had left it lying a long time behinde the Chest: insomuch that it was all rustie in a maner, and cleane marred. At last the <hi>Lutherans</hi> gat it into their handes,<note place="margin">The Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans haue found one key.</note> and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it before them as a paterne, made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:20494:94"/>
like it: insomuch that they haue opened all the lockes, and by that meanes haue brought all the secretes of the holy Church to light, and so haue of their owne priuate motion and accorde taken vpon them, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the scripture to their furtherance, and to the holy church of Rome her hinderance: so that she hath now quite lost that key.</p>
                  <p>The other key is called <hi>Expositio mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis,</hi> That is,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Expositio moralis.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>A legall or morall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation:</hi> or, <hi>An interpretation accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law:</hi> with which key they haue locked vp fast all the Chestes and treasures of mercifull iustification through beliefe in Iesus Christ: and in place thereof, haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked &amp; set open the maledictions, cursses, and threatnings of the law of <hi>Moses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The thirde is called <hi>Expositio Tropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logica,</hi> or <hi>Allegorica,</hi> that is to say,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Expositio allegorica.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>An hidde and allegoricall vnderstanding or interpretation,</hi> with which key, they lightly wreste all the Scriptures, that the Heretikes can bring in against them: for that therewith they finde out straight way, some figure or allegorie, wherewith they deck &amp; set out the matter finely, &amp; so couer it with a course carpet. And further likewise w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this key she hath brought abrode the most
<pb facs="tcp:20494:95"/>
part of the Scripture, wherewith she hath fortified and made strong all her Catholike ceremonies, beautifull prunkings, &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant ordinaunces, as by proceeding from piece to piece we will declare.</p>
                  <p>The fourth key is verie like vnto this, but it is of more strength, and is called <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positio Anagogica,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Expositio, Anagogica.</hi>
                     </note> that is to say, <hi>An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation which drawes the Scripture by the necke, euen whither a man will:</hi> and it is the best and most beneficiall key, that the Church doth occupie for her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage: for with this key she makes of the Scripture a Weathercocke,<note place="margin">The scripture made a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thercocke, and a nose of waxe.</note> which turnes about with euerie winde: and a nose of waxe, which shee can bow euerie way: as by the examples hereafter set forth you shal plainly perceiue.</p>
                  <p>Now hath she besides these, two other keyes, which are not right <hi>Imperatrices,</hi> but do serue particularly, either of them to his owne seuerall locke: whereof the one is called <hi>Typica,</hi> and the other <hi>Physica,</hi> that is to say,<note place="margin">

And with these, she hath (for the most part) opened all the Almeries of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balla,</hi> &amp; <hi>Thalmood</hi> of the Iewes, and out of them fetched all sorts of delicate meates and daintie iunckets, as (without doubt) there were wonderfull iestes and straunge mysteries shut vp in them.</p>

For the holie Church of Rome, doubting least the Heretikes might yet catche from her anie more keyes, as they did once, causeth more newe knottes and buttons daily to bee made to them: yea, and giueth the maisters of that science great wages. For he that can best braide and make them vp, hee gettes for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde a Doctours hood, or a fat Prebend: and sometimes a Bishops miter, or a Cardinals hatte: so that it is a great o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersight of these <hi>Huguenotes,</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi> that they thinke to make all thinges cleare, with their one key, and will with that onelie expounde the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, all care and regarde of the other keyes put by and neglected. Yea, they make no accounte at all of this Keybande: but will vnderstande euerie thing as they are learned by the letter, none otherwise than they are sette foorth in the Scripture: rightly and agreeably to the sinceritie of the faith:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.</note> and according to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

But The spirit, that is to say, The ghostly, hid, and sharp witted interpretation, which our louing mother the holy Church hath made vpon it, (let it bee allegoricall, or anago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall, or what it will,) this is onelie that which makes mightie and liuing: because this alone both agree with the iudgement of the holy Church of Rome. And all they which doe truely follow her, those are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to liue in all libertie and wealth: yea, although they do not beleue that there is a God. Therefore, whosoeuer will not accept this interpretation of the holie church, and vnderstand the scripture ghost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or spiritually as the Catholikes doe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande and interprete the same, he is a damned Heretike, and his processe is at an ende, although he had all the textes of the scripture verie plaine, &amp; the whole volume

                  <p>And for this cause I doe maruell, that our good master <hi>Gentian,</hi> will breake his head about this matter: namely to proue, That the Scripture alone is not sufficient for our mother the holie Church, as though that matter were not plaine and euident i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, sithence we may daily both see and feele it. And yet notwithstanding commes he out here with his profounde speculation, in such sort as he hath almost therein for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten himselfe.

the holie Church is not therewith sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, because greate disorder might followe: for that then there shoulde be no mo priests which could serue in the Masse: &amp; therfore she hath strongly concluded, that this place of the prophesie of <hi>Malachie,</hi> may not any otherwise be vnderstood, than by the second councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Constance,</hi> the councell of <hi>Trent:</hi> &amp; further, as by al Catholike men, as <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas de Aquino, Scotus, Durandus,</hi> and by all the Doctours of <hi>Louen,</hi> it hath bene vnderstoode, &amp; interpreted. Iudging with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, that all these profounde learned Doctours, together on a cluster, as hauing greater measure of wisedome and learning than the rest, did vnderstande <hi>Malachie</hi> farre better than Peter and Iohn, who were but simple fishers,<note place="margin">In the .4. booke of Sentences in the .24. dist. cap. 1.</note> and had neuer bene Studentes in the famous and renowmed Vniuersitie of <hi>Louen.</hi> And yet, if it were so, that Peter were not content, yet hath the holie Church giuen him to vnderstand, that his foresaide reason must bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode &amp; meant of the Priests only: and not of the generall congregation of Christ.</p>

For, if men will vnderstande them, according to their nature, after the letter: to wit, That all perfite Christians must of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vp to God, their bodies, in all holinesse, by that it should seeme, that Paul hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise vnderstoode Malachie, than the holie Church doth vnderstande him.

But all this doeth not serue the purpose, touching out matter: for if that were true, then the Masse would be nothing worth, and our Priestes might go with emptie stomachs, and in the end be glad to get them into some hospitall for a refuge, or at least to gette their liuing with painfull labour: which would be a pitifull case, considering that they haue neuer bene vsed to anie labour, but simplie to say Masse, sing Euensong, and to mumble ouer their Mattens, and therewith to deserue first a liuing here on earth, and afterwardes heauen for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, their pretie wenches, and their yong bastardes. Therefore doeth our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the holie Church conclude, that the Apostle, in his Epistle to the Hebrewes,

<pb facs="tcp:20494:107"/>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Souldiers, to stake their hunger and thirst.

But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle had neuer heard anie such newes: and therfore he is to be borne withall: but these Heretikes, who haue read ouer all these things, with our Doctours: yea, they haue it at their fingers ends: and yet they make but a mocke at it: those felowes truelie, are worthie to be looked at vnder the browes, and to haue their heades set betwixt two eares.</p>

                  <p>Is not this a sufficient proofe? you are welcome home.<note place="margin">Dist. 21. ca. 1.</note> And likewise, that the other Priestes are also come out of the order of Leui, doth sufficiently appeare out of that which is before rehearsed.</p>
                  <p>Therefore is the Apostle much ouerseene in his Epistle to the Hebrewes, where hee will take vpon him, to mainteine, that the order and succession of the Leuites should be wholy taken away and adnihilated, or at least, he must be thus vnderstoode, as that the order of Leui is not taken away, anie otherwise, but that in place of the Iewish Leuites are entred in the Priestes &amp; Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners: &amp; in place of their sacrifices, is the Masse crept in.

But we haue yet a much clearer text, to witte, where Christ himselfe saieth: <hi>This is my bodie</hi>: for by those wordes doeth the holie Church of Rome plainely vnderstand, that the same
<pb facs="tcp:20494:115"/>
which before was breade, is nowe no more breade, although Paule woulde call it breade a thousande times: but is chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the verie bodie of Iesus Christ, as long, and as broade, as it was han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vpon the Crosse. And for that cause it is, that shee doeth disallowe all the expositions and interpretations, which <hi>Basilius, Tertullianus, Theodoretus, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustinus,</hi> and other holie Fathers haue sette foorth vpon the same: saying, That those woordes must bee figuratiuely and sacramentally vnderstoode, as Christ himselfe hath plainely saide: <hi>I am the vine:</hi> or, as Paule saieth: <hi>The stone was Christ:</hi> and as GOD spake to Abraham, saying: <hi>This is my promise, Cut off the fore skinne, &amp;c.</hi> Which is as muche to say, that the breade shoulde not chaunge his nature, nor the verie bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christ bee there present, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie that it shoulde bee a true and holie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, a Sacrament, a warrant and pledge, a Seale and assuraunce, whereby wee are assured and fullie certified, that hee hath giuen vppe his bodie and bloud for our saluation.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:20494:115"/>
Greeke <hi>Typus,</hi> and <hi>Antitypa,</hi> that is to say, Speciall tokens. But I doe tell you, that the holie Church of Rome will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe anie such interpretations: vnlesse it were so, that men woulde vnderstand them as <hi>Damascenus</hi> doeth interprete them, and as was in the seconde Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> concluded by the Fathers: to witte, That the breade shoulde bee such a seale, pledge, figure, and holie token, onely before it be consecrated: which is to say, It should be a Sacrament, before it is become a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
                  <p>For, that this is their conceite and meaning, it is apparaunt out of this, That long before the breade and the wine bee consecrated, or made a holie Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: they doe offer vppe the same vnto God, for remission of sinnes, as well of the liuing, as of the dead.<note place="margin">The Canon of the Masse.</note> For in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Masse: yea, before the bread bee turned into fleshe, or the fiue holy wordes of consecration be heard, the Priest doeth pray, <hi>That God will accept that offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of breade,</hi>

                  <p>And in one of the secretes which is commonly read vpon the 24. Sunday after Trinitie Sunday, he saith thus:</p>

For as they can of a peece of breade make God himselfe, and of nothing create something: wherfore should not they likewise be able to make of no Sacrament a Sacrament: and of a Sacrament, no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament? That is to say, that a simple peece of bread shoulde bee a holie token and seale of the bloud of Iesus Christ, euen before it bee made holie and consecrated. And then <hi>Econtra,</hi> that the Sacrament of the bodie of Christ, shall bee no more ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Sacrament, or token, but euen the verie bodie of Christ it selfe? So that the holie Fathers must needes haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode it so, especially, when they say that
<pb facs="tcp:20494:117"/>
this Sacrament is but a token, a seale, and a pledge, specialy before it is become a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. For after that it is once a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then (no remedie) our deare mothers will is, that it shall bee fleshe and bloud, and not anie longer neither bread nor wine, to signifie the fleshe and the bloud. And therefore doeth she not make anie account of the exposition of Christ Iesus himselfe, who (after he had saide of the bread) <hi>This is my bodie</hi>: and afterward of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of Cuppe: <hi>This is the new Testament in my bloud</hi>: thereby declaring, that those words, <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> must be so vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode, as if hee had saide:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke,</hi> 22.20. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25.</note> 
                     <hi>This breade is the new promise in my bodie, which shall bee broken for you.</hi> For of that shoulde followe, that the breade, after the consecration, and likewise after the spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the fiue wordes, should still remaine breade, and so bee but simplie a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and true token of the bodie of Iesus Christ: as shewing vnto vs the promise of God, made in the breaking of the bodie, and shedding of the bloud of Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus our Sauiour, as was saide of the Circumcision: <hi>This is my couenant which I doe make with you,</hi> to witte, for that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:20494:117"/>
the Circumcision is a sure and holie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, a pledge, and seale, through which the promise of God is verie stronglie and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiallie made vnto the faithfull. No, no, I assure you: that liketh the holie Church of <hi>Rome</hi> nothing at all. She will lay fast holde vpon the first wordes of Christ, and not seek after anie exposition or glosse, how necessarie soeuer they bee. And for that cause shall Paule go without anie <hi>Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit,</hi> when he commeth in with his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and saith, <hi>That the bread which we do breake, is the communion of the bodie of Christ.</hi> For thereby it should also seeme, that it remaineth bread still after the consecration: and that it is not the bodie it self, but a remembrance of the bodie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which thing the holie Church in no wise admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nor alloweth, for life nor death. But es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciallie, she will not accept nor like of the interpretation following, wherein Paule proceeding doeth declare, how and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bread is the communion of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christ, saying, <hi>For al we which eate of one bread, become one bodie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nowe truelie, that soundeth not well: for we do not al becom one bodie in substance, as the holie Church will haue the bread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb facs="tcp:20494:118"/>
the verie body of Christ in substance. But then the similitude, which after that he introduceth or bringeth in, is to farre out of the way. For hee saieth, <hi>That those which feede of the altar, are partakers of the altar: and that those that offer vp to idols, are partakers with the diuell.</hi> And so making a comparison of the table of the Lord, and the table of the diuell: as though the Priestes could not eate vp that bodie of Christ otherwise, than as idolaters eate vp the diuels: and as though these wordes, <hi>Eate that bodie of Christ,</hi> did signifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but this, through the power of the holie Ghost to be made one bodie ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie with the bodie of Christ, as the vngodly idolaters, by power of the wicked spirite are vnited with the diuell: That is to hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous an heresie: and therefore wee may not stande vpon this similitude: for it soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But when you will haue a substantiall similitude, you must search and seeke it out of <hi>Scotus,</hi> and <hi>Thomas de Aquino,</hi> or <hi>Panormitanus,</hi> and such like. For they bring in for this purpose, a goodlie si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of a Tauerne, or common Inne,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:20494:118"/>
where they sell wine: <hi>For as there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie a potte, a garlande,</hi>

                     <hi>or Iuie bush hanged out, betokening that to be a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne: and the Tauerne doeth signifie, that there is wine plentie: So likewise you see here the outward accidentes of bread, to witte, the roundnesse and the whitenesse, which doe signifie, that vnder the same is conteined the verie bodie of Christ, which is to bee resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to the Tauerne. And this bodie of Christ doeth further signifie the holie Church of Rome, which is made one with the bodie of Christ, which they call Mysticum corpus Christi, that is to say, The spiritual or mystical bodie of Christ: and this is that sweete wine which the Priestes drinke in that Inne or Tauerne.</hi> And after this they doe likewise bring for a similitude, the water which in <hi>Cana of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilie</hi> was plainlie turned into wine: which similitude doeth so wonderfull well serue for this purpose, as to set a fift wheele in a wagon. But it is pitie that the Priestes haue not other fiue wordes, whereby they might do that too. For then should the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude serue their turne much better, if that they might (when they woulde)
<pb facs="tcp:20494:119"/>
conuerte and turne the water into good wine: for that they might therewith the better scoure and refresh their drie throtes, when they are become verie hoarse with singing of their seruice. And it is verie true, that they doe what they can for that purpose: for on Saturday, being Easter eeuen, they praye vnto God, that hee will also do so much as to turne their Beere, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">This is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie praier of the priest ouer the Beere, from worde to word, as it standeth in the Masse, &amp; as Munst. saith</note>

But yet notwithstanding, when all is well considered, this is not yet the verie right tune and harmonious noyse, which the holie Church commonly vseth in this daunse: for out of this might follow, That God should impute righteousnesse to those which are not righteous in them selues: and through Christs merites, and for his sake, forgiue sinnes without any other satisfaction.

But if we be of our selues sufficiently furnished to satisfie all that resteth, or if wee can by some of the Saintes, to whome wee haue good deuotion, get a good suretie or pledge which will answere for all: then wee shall haue no neede to trouble Christ much, wee can spare him well enough. Then onelie, if we hauing done our best to satisfie all our selues, or to finde a sufficient suretie, and yet can not bring either of both to passe, then saieth our deare mother the holie Church, that Christ must come foorth, <hi>Vt suppleat nostros defectus,</hi> that is to say, <hi>To supplie our defaultes,</hi> and to stoppe

                  <p>
                     <hi>It is most true, that Christ came into this world, not onely to take away that sinne, wherein naturally all the posteritie of Adam are borne, but likewise to the cleansing of all other sinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in the <hi>49.</hi> question of the said thirde part: <hi>Christ</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath released vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our sinnes, Causaliter, that is, Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the cause, to wit, for that he is the onely cause of our releasment, through which all our sinnes are to bee forgiuen, as well those past, as these present, or to come.</hi> And then againe: <hi>Forsomuch as the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Christ, is a sure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> generall, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cause of the forgiuing of sinne, it must needes follow, that it bee annexed to the washing away and purging of the sinnes which we our selues haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which is don by baptisme &amp; pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and other sacraments which haue power through the passion of Christ, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In summe, this is their meaning, That as the sinnes wherein wee fell before bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, haue not more aduauntage than
<pb facs="tcp:20494:147"/>
the other, but must all alike be holpen tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough penance and Sacramentes: which are the right satisfaction, and true raunsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, through which God is made at one with vs, and hath forgiuen vs our sinnes. And yet they haue not gotten this power only of themselues: but for that Christ hath (through his merits and passion) deserued the same: so that by this order, Christ hath now his part in all things, seeing that he (in all the merites of the Masse, satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and other good workes,) is alway by our deare mother the holy Church called to be one. And this office is committed vnto him, that hee shall alway trudge vppe and downe, to and fro, farre and neere, with the merites of good workes and satisfaction, as a common messenger, &amp; trauell so as they may continue in their full estimation and worship. And for that cause it is, that in all their blessings, hallowings, consecrations, coniuring, and bewitching, in all Collects, Secrets, Complets, and in all Ceremonies of the holie Church, wherein they pray vnto God for the forgiuenes of sinnes, for euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting life, &amp; for all other good gifts, either spirituall, or temporall, which she requires in consideration, &amp; the power of her almes

For our deare mother the holy church of <hi>Rome</hi> saieth plainlie, by speciall textes of the Scripture, That God doeth neuer cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie forgiue and pardon the punishment for sinnes, through the merites of the bloud and passion of Christ, without a former sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.

but not the punishment: as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the example of Adam, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, after his fall, hee receiued com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort againe at Gods hande, yet was hee well punished, euen by bodilie death, and with manie calamities, sorrowes, and troubles, by the which hee made satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>And likewise, take example of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Dauid, who hauing grieuouslie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended God, and afterwardes returned by repentance, obteined forgiuenesse of his sinnes: and was yet afterwardes, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this, sharplie punished, &amp; so forth of manie other examples.

the same. And this will we proue wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully by an inuincible argument. Heare now a little and mark well, for here the ewe lambs. These Hexetikes must needs (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or no) graunt this, That no mans sinnes are forgiuen him without pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. And now you must consider, <hi>That penance is nothing els but a punishment for sinne.</hi> For looke, thus the Master of the Sentences doth write: <hi>Poenitentia dicitur a puniendo,</hi>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Ergo,</hi> this matter is clere, and the Heretikes catched in a snare.

not haue this vnderstoode of diuels: <hi>Ergo</hi> then it must needs folow, that it is spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the souls which lay burning in Purgatorie. For thus saith S. Iohn in the Apocalypse touching the same matter:<note place="margin">Apo. 5.13.</note> 
                     <hi>And all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which are in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; in the earth, &amp; vnder the earth, &amp; in the sea, &amp; all that are in them, heard I, saying, Blessing, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, &amp; power, be to him that sitteth vpon the seat, &amp; vnto the lambe for euermore.</hi> Where vndoubtedly he doth vnderstand &amp; meane Purgatorie, according to the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of our deare mother, the holie Church of Rome.

by which reasons it appeareth, that the soules of drowned men, place themselues in the bowels of fishes.

And therefore we neede not to trouble our selues much, with bringing out the booke of the Machabies for a witnesse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by cause the Heretikes to mocke and ieast at vs. For they say, that that booke is so farre off from being allowed for an authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike booke of holie Scripture,<note place="margin">Machab. 15.29.40.</note> that the writer and Authour of the same, did desire to bee pardoned and borne withall, if hee had not written so sufficiently as he ought.

                     <hi>it is great reason, that the sillie soules shoulde be relieued of their paines on those dayes.</hi> In consideration wherof, it appeareth a maruellous charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deede of our deare mother the holie church of Rome, to haue instituted so many holie dayes (beside Sundayes) &amp; comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to be solemnely kept, because the soules may vppon those dayes rest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and go a playing: for that it is to be thought, that they obserue as well the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes of the holie Church, as Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: otherwise they were no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than <hi>Lutherans.</hi> And now we know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie wel, that there commeth no <hi>Lutheran</hi> into Purgatorie: for Purgatorie is only for the good Catholikes which hold fast on the church of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that it is verelie to be thought, that the poore soules are as well holpe vp w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> so many idle holy daies, as with the Nonnes discipline on their bare arsses: yet it is to bee considered, that albeit this, they must be praied for on Sundaies &amp; other Holie daies, as well as on the worke daies, when they lie scortching &amp; scalding

and weare a cloth made of Camels haire next the skinne, &amp; a stone vnder the head in place of a pillowe. This soule did choose much rather to doe all that same harde pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in earth, than to tarie one daie lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in Purgatorie.

Wherevnto the Pope answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Yes surelie, considering that all his power and authoritie came from them. Then the Secretarie did demaunde of him againe: Whether that of so manie Popes, and holie Fathers, which had possessed that place before him, there were not one of them so mercifull and louing towardes the poore soules,
<pb facs="tcp:20494:170"/>
that had taken vppon him to doe that charitable deed, if his power did so farre extend? Vnto this the Pope answered, As touching that, he knewe not. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the Secretarie gaue him a full reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, saying, I can tell then certeinlie: Once our Lord Iesus Christ, chief Bishop of all Bishops, &amp; Pope aboue all Popes, had full power and authoritie to doe the same, for that he was almightie: and hee had also the will to doe it, for that he was most mercifull: and did likewise beare an infinite affection and loue vnto all mankind, in so much that he did ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuallie and fullie accomplish that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So that it is not needful for anie man to trouble him self anie more about that matter, seeing hee hath (by offering vp of his bodie) obteined a pardon of God the Father, and sealed the same for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, with his owne pretious bloud for the redemption of all faithfull soules,</hi>

                     <hi>&amp; one sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard:</hi> as to vnderstand, When all the nations vpon earth, shall be subiect to the Pope. Like as now in our daies we haue seene a good beginning, &amp; do daily see with our eyes very great appera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of more. And that the Pope ought not only to haue a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall gouernment as a Bishop: but must likewise maintein a worldly gouernment, as a king, is by clere testimonie of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our deare mother the holy Church approued.<note place="margin">The Pope is a king.</note> For there is without doubt, a plaine text,<note place="margin">This you shall find in the text before alleged of the decretals. <hi>ff. in hac ext. de maioritate &amp; obedientia.</hi>
                     </note> that the Apostles did say: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold here are two swordes.</hi> Wherevnto Christ answered not, saying: <hi>That it was too manie, but that, that was inough.</hi>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:20494:179"/>
Now out of this doth our deare mother co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That the Pope of Rome must vse two swordes, to wit, a spirituall, &amp; a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sword. Ho ball, ho how will this sound in the eares of the Heretikes?</p>
                  <p>But now must they vnderstand for a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall matter, that a good while ago there was in Spaine an honest man, who coulde not vnderstand it so, saying that this scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did serue nothing at al to that purpose. And by and by, the holy inquisition (which is the dearest and chiefest nourse &amp; fosterfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Church of Rome) did take him, and burne him at a stake, as one which had highly blasphemed: because that vpon his opinion should follow, that the holy church hath not full power to interprete the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as she will: which I assure you is a terrible slaunder.</p>
                  <p>Therefore haue these heretikes need to looke well to the matter, &amp; kepe their ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, &amp; giue eare to other testimonies and witnesses. For yet besides this, Christ said to Peter: <hi>Put vp thy sword into the sheth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In the extraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gants <hi>de maiori. &amp; obedi.</hi> and is likewise so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the councell of Reines.</note> Out of those words doth plainly appeare (as our holy father <hi>Bonifacius</hi> the 8. saith) <hi>That both the swordes, as well the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, as the spirituall, are vnder the
<pb facs="tcp:20494:180"/>
power and iurisdiction of the Church,</hi> Yea, and it is verie necessarie, that the one sword be subiect to the other: which is to be vnderstood, That the temporal iurisdiction and authoritie must be subiect to the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall &amp; ecclesiasticall power and authoritie. For (according to the saying of S. Paule) <hi>There is no power or authoritie, but that which is appointed by God. Truely (saith he) there would be no good regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if the one sword were not subiect to the other: and that the lower and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour were (by some good meanes) brought in subiection and obedience to the higher and superior.</hi> Consider, this is the onely naturall and grounded interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the before alledged text of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Scripture, as our deare mother the holy Church hath interpreted the same, word by word. Is not this Popingaie then trimly shot downe? Lee these <hi>Huguenots,</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> come out now, who crie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that we cannot establish the power &amp; authoritie of the Pope by anie scriptures: now they may see, that we haue scriptures <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But now will we teach out of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, That the Pope only hath power to consecrate and halow Churches, &amp; to blesse

                     <hi>Anacletus,</hi> and the holie Church of Rome: vnderstanding the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thus, That the Priests are to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as the very changers &amp; sellers in the Church, who do vtter their merchandize so deare, that the sight of them (manie times) will stand a man dearer, than the best ware that the Habardashers of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Lions</hi> haue in their shoppes. And although other chaungers of monie, and vsurers,
<pb facs="tcp:20494:195"/>
did inioy the benefites of the like priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as well as the Priests, to witte, that they were with the same whipping driuen out of the temple: yea, and although dogs be sometime vsed after the same manner: yet, considering that the Priestes are my white sonnes, and must haue somewhat the more preeminence and aduauntage, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for that their merchaundize are of more estimation than the rest, and their incense of better smell than the incense that the dogges smother abroade in the Church. Insomuch that the holie Church of Rome doeth vnderstande this by the priests onelie, to wit, that temporall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates or Officers, shall haue no iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction ouer them, considering well, that Christ had them in such estimation as he himselfe onelie woulde whippe them out of the Church. And yet hath shee more strongly established the same, by the plaine Texte of the Prophete Dauid, where it is written,<note place="margin">Psal. 81.1.6. This procedeth forth after, in the said epistle of <hi>Anacletus.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>God stoode in the middest of the Gods,</hi> that is to say, of Priests and Prelats. Againe, <hi>I haue said, All you are Gods.</hi> Now truth it is, that the whole Psalme doeth (after the letter) speake of Kings and Gouernours of this
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:20494:195"/>
world: yet notwithstanding, our deare mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the holie Church, hath vnderstood the same wholy of the Priestes and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie, according to the spirit, and that speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by reason of sixe weightie causes: to witte:</p>
                  <p>First, because the whole text doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, as well, or rather much better, vpon the Priestes, than vpon anie other: for it is written, <hi>That will not vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but will walk in darknesse, and set the whole world in a rore.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In the 5. verse of the saide Psalme.</note> Which wordes seeme to conclude so well vpon Priestes and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, as though they had bene spoken on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them.</p>
                  <p>Now secondly, the Priests are of much more estimation, &amp; better, than any Kings,<note place="margin">This is set out with plaine wordes in the <hi>cap. Duo sunt. dist.</hi> 69. and in the <hi>cap. Sacerdo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Quis dubitat. dist.</hi> 96.</note> or Princes: yea, they do excell them as far as Leade doth Gold: and therefore must Emperours bow downe their heads vnder the knees of the Popes: as is plainely set forth by the holie father Pope <hi>Gelasius,</hi> writing vnto the Emperour <hi>Anastasius,</hi> and registred in the decrees. Yea, they are the light of the world, Fathers &amp; Maisters to all men: so that they deserue much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be called Gods, than either Kings or other Rulers do or can deserue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:20494:196"/>Thirdly, the Priestes are of more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse and estimation than Angels.<note place="margin">

And it is plainelie written: <hi>That no man may buie or sell,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 13.17.</note> 
                     <hi>vnlesse hee haue the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter or the marke, or else the name of the beast.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, as touching the fourth cause, you must vnderstand, that all Priestes are fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low partners (in some case) with our holie Father the Pope, who is not onely a man, but a God on earth. Which considered, they must needes by kinred bee partakers of his Godhead: as it is written, That commonly a man growes like him, with whom he is conuersant. And againe, Hee that medleth with pitch, some part of it wil cleaue to him. And therefore such as bee conu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rsant with God on earth, must needs be godlie.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, it is great reason they shoulde bee called Gods, seeing that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues can make God: and are (as wee
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:20494:196"/>

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is to say, <hi>Whensoeuer anie thing doeth get anie vertue or estimation out of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, or by the gift of an other: the same by whome hee doeth receiue that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse or vertue, must needes haue verie much more like vertue in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seeing then, that by the power and knowledge of the Priest, a piece of breade may be made God, how much rather then are the Priests themselues Gods? For it is written in the holie scripture,<note place="margin">Iere. 16.20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>That no man in this world can make anie Gods: Ergo,</hi> then must the Priests of necessitie be more than men, seeing they do daily make God himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Now sixtly, the common Latine text, which is receiued in the holie Church of Rome, and by the Councell of Trent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for good &amp; credible, doeth say thus, <hi>That God did stand in the Synagogue
<pb facs="tcp:20494:197"/>
of the Gods.</hi> Which may verie well bee applied to the Priestes, considering that they also haue their Synagogues, like as the Iewes haue had heretofore. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, it is most certeine, that Christ stoode in the middest of the Priestes and Prelates, at such time as <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> accuse him, and sought witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses against him, to put him to death. Which manner of doing, our Priestes of the holie Church of Rome, doe verie liuely counterfeite. Whereby it is plaine to bee vnderstoode, that they are the Gods in the Synagogue, amongest whome the Lorde stoode, and doeth yet (by his elect) daily stand to bee condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to death. So that our deare mother the holie Church of Rome, hath verie aptly applied this Text vnto them, and so concluded, <hi>That they being Gods, can in no wise bee subiect vnto the iudgement or correction of any earthly man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides this, she doth bring forth manie witnesses, euen by heapes, all which are fetched out of holy Scripture: as speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, where Saint Luke saieth, <hi>That God shall aduenge his elect.</hi>

                     </note> It is likewise
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:20494:197"/>
written in the Psalmes: <hi>Lorde God, to whom vengeance belongeth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 194.2.</note> 
                     <hi>God to whom vengeance belongeth, shewe thy selfe, &amp;c.</hi> Also, the Apostle Paule saieth, <hi>What art thou that iudgest an other mannes seruant?</hi> And in the same place,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.14. Rom. 14.13.</note> 
                     <hi>Let vs not therefore iudge one an other anie more, but iudge this rather, that no man put a stumbling blocke or an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to fall in his brothers way.</hi> And the Lord saith by his Prophet Zacharie: <hi>For,</hi>

                     <hi>who so toucheth you, shall touche the apple of his owne eye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Are not these honest, goodlie, and verie strong witnesses, such as can not bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued? And doe they not plainlie set forth that the Priestes can not be vnder subiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to anie temporall iurisdiction?

But nowe is there one speciall text to bee brought in and alledged, against the which ariseth no obiection, to wit, where Christ
<pb facs="tcp:20494:198"/>
saith,<note place="margin">Math. 8.20. Luke. 9.5.8.</note> 
                     <hi>Foxes haue their dennes, and the Foules of the aire haue their nestes, but the Sonne of man hath not whereon to laie his head.</hi> These Heretikes may well inough sloppe their eares at th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s: for out of this doeth our deare mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude verie strongly, That those which will blame or finde anie faulte with the Priestes, are they whom Christ here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Foxes. And to the corroboration and strengthening of the same, shee bringeth forth the text of Solomon, where he saith: <hi>Hee that hath digged the pitte, shall fall into it him selfe.</hi> Againe, <hi>The stone is heauie, and the sande is weightie, but the wrath of a foole doeth passe both.</hi> Consider, doe not these agree in one mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous well? It seemeth they are both painted with one pencill. In summe, all her decrees and ordinances are full of such apte textes and sentences of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which shee can wrest and wring mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous finelie for her purpose: so that there is not one stitche amisse. For, when as the Scripture speaketh of <hi>Bruggesse,</hi> shee applieth that to <hi>Ghent:</hi> and if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speake of a Catte, shee will bring in a Ducke.</p>

                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:20494:198"/>For a finall end and conclusion, shee can make of a Cowe a Windmill: and of a Windmill a Cowe. And therefore she can not lacke, but doeth alway finde witnesses enow out of holie Scripture, to proue all her matters substantiall and good.</p>

                  <p>Nowe thirdly, the holie fathers say, That seeing images may be had secretlie, wherefore should wee not (much rather) haue them openlie to pray to them? For notwithstanding that God hath forbidden it, yet he must bee giuen otherwise to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the matter: for he was not yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that images are the bookes of the Laie people, till such time as Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> came, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

But nowe, euerie man doeth knowe, that bookes must be laide vppon a deske, that euerie man may reade on them, and are not to bee cast behind a banke, or in a corner. For it is plainlie written, that a candle is not to bee set vnder a bushell, but in a candlesticke, that euerie man may bee lighted thereby:<note place="margin">In the epistle of <hi>Adrian</hi> to the <hi>synod. act.</hi> 2. <hi>fol.</hi> 481.</note> which the holie fathers doe likewise vnderstande by the images, to witte, that they must stande on high pranking vppon the altars, and so be deuoutlie prayed vnto by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sort.</p>
                  <p>Besides all this, they bring forth, that Moses did set vppe a brasen Serpent in the wildernesse,<note place="margin">The brasen serpent.</note> by Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:20494:202"/>
to the intent that all such as should looke therevpon, might bee healed of the biting of the venomous serpentes.

so as hee was about a three yeeres from home: And then when hee came home againe, hee found his wife merrie, and had in the meane space gotten three prettie children, with helpe of the good Saintes, which hee so deuoutlie had sought.</hi>

                  <p>And nowe will wee proceede to our matter againe, and campe with these He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, who mocke and iest with these our holie fathers of the foresaid Councell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they bring in and alledge an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the brasen serpent, to establishe their images, by saying, That the same was a figure in the olde Testament, pointing to Christ, and was set vppe by GOD his speciall commaundement: but vnto this wee will answere them, That they haue eaten stockfish, and knowe not what doeth belong to a pregnant and ripe wit: for otherwise, can they not perceiue, that our images are figures likewise, as wel of Christ, as of his deare mother, grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

and other holie hee Saintes and she Saintes: yea, and that are by speciall commaundement of our holie father the Pope, and the holie Church set foorth. But yet for all this, these dull Heretikes goe on forward with their follie, saying, That the good King Ezechias did breake downe and burne to powder,<note place="margin">Brasen serpent burnt. 2. Reg. 18.4.</note> the same bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen serpent, as soone as euer hee sawe and did perceiue, that the people beganne to cense and honour it, in like manner as the holie Church of Rome doeth nowe honour and worship her Saintes. And those mad brained fellowes doe therevpon conclude, that wee ought likewise euen so to burne our images. But wee denie that flatlie: for that was an other matter, considering that our images are no serpentes, as that was.</p>
                  <p>It is verie true, that wee doe as well cense to Saint Margaret, Saint Georges dragon, and Saint Anthonies hogs, as to the Saints themselues, &amp; pray to the one as well as to the other, although those are not much better than serpents: but that now is otherwise to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered, for it is not done in honor of the dragons, but of the Sainte which they stand by: as is well proued by a

certeine Doctour of <hi>Louen,</hi> who going out of the porche of the graie Friers, at <hi>Louen</hi> did put off his bonnet before the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of Pilate, which standeth there, &amp; so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly turning back again, cried w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a lowd voice: <hi>Non tibi Pilate, sed Christo,</hi> as though hee would haue said: <hi>As for thee Pilate, thou art but a varlot: what dost thou thinke?

                  </p>
                  <p>Nowe consider, euen so standeth the matter with our Dragons, and with S. Anthonies hogs. They gette many times offrings and waxe candles, and are often times kissed for neighbourhood, for the good Saint sake by whom they stand: but they doe not take it vppon them selues, no more then a dumbe stocke or blocke. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remaineth this determination of the holy fathers of the said Councell, alwayes fast and ratified, to witte, That the holie Church must haue images: seeing that the Iewes had a brasen serpent. This is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise mainteined with manie other goodlie testimonies, as specially with that which the prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> saith in the 96. psalme, <hi>There is praise &amp; honor before his face.</hi>

Then said the diuell: If thou wilt that I shall trouble thee no more, then thou must not pray anie more to that image: and it was an image of our Ladie, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her childe in her armes.

                  <p>And whereas the holy Church hath also chosen to make the similitude of the father, an olde man, with a long gray beard: and for the sonne, a man hanging on the crosse: and for knowledge of the holie Ghost, a doue: that is done of her owne inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and free will.

                  <p>And because hee was wounde in a fine white cloth, when he was buried, therefore doe they lay their litle god vppon a white cloth, fast by the chalice.</p>
                  <p>And because the souldiers did cut Christ his garments in pieces, and so dealt them amongst them for a prey, therfore it is that the Priestes do (vpon good Friday) couer their altar with one single cloth, &amp; then laie two other small clothes or napkins, at the endes of the altar: and as soone as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to sing these wordes: <hi>Partiti sunt vesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta mea, They diuided my garments amongst them:</hi> so must likewise those two clothes or napkins by and by be stollen &amp; pluckt away from the altar.</p>
                  <p>And because Christ after his resurrection

did breath vpon his Disciples, and gaue vnto them the holie Ghost. Therefore it is that the Bishops and Suffraganes, at such time as they doe create anie Priest, doe blowe vpon them: for with that same winde are the Priestes filled as full of the holie Ghost, as a Cowe turde is stuffed full of muske and ambers grease.</p>

                  <p>And after the same manner, wee play by the Lent. For, because Christ did fast four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie daies lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, therfore shal our dere mother
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:20494:218"/>
the holie church bee content to fill her belly all sortes of fish onlie, not once touching one morsell of flesh, according to the special wordes of Paule, who saith, <hi>Eate it not: Taste it not: Handle it not.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 2.21.</note> And so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Moses did fast fourtie dayes, for the establishing of the lawes of God, which he presented vnto the people. And now, seeing the Bishops &amp; Prelates do weare hornes, as Moses did, wherefore should they not as well faste fourtie dayes as he did? And if the Bishops doo faste, then are the Leye people much more bounde to faste, which haue no such power nor meane to obteine dispensations, bulles, or tollerations of our holie father the Pope, as these holie Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates haue.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we do now conclude, without exception or contradiction, That the holie time of Lent is as firmelie founded vpon the scripture, as all the rest of the articles of the faith inuented and founded by our deare mother the holie church of Rome: and therfore it is good reason, that our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the holie church of Rome do maintein her Lent &amp; fish dayes in great reputation, &amp; not onelie to hold it for a good and holie work in it self, but for a meritorious work,

whereby we may merit &amp; deserue heauen, &amp; the mercie of God, appease his wrath, and do &amp; make sufficient satisfaction &amp; recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense for all our sins.

                  <p>And now after this, to prouide so for the matter, that these holie Fathers should not go to grossely to worke, therefore hath our deare mother the holie Church, laid an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance before her spouses, the Priests and Spiritualtie, that they might freely vse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens wiues, &amp; that all women ought to be common for them.

                  <p>Note here the determination &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of our deare mother the holy church worde by word. whereby shee doeth abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutelie conclude out of the holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that these Heretikes, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in hand with the scriptures, haue now no more cause to complaine, though the Priests &amp; Friers will sometime (euen for loue) borrow some of their wiues, for the mainteining &amp; knitting together of this holy <hi>Clements</hi> commontie.

And that is apparant inough, by the daylie exercise thereof: for you see that the Priestes may haue no wiues of their owne, but doe

vse all women in generall, when, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they can get them.

that all the ceremonies of the holie church of Rome, all their prankings, and strange deuises, are finely founded vpon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so that there is not one lacking: yea, and that the Scripture is wholie on our side, if it be right vnderstood, according to the meaning and interpretation of our deare mother the holie Church: to witte, that you passe ouer and let slippe the dead letter, and the plaine text, &amp; depend wholie vpon the spirit of speculation of our Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of <hi>Louen,</hi> &amp; those of <hi>Paris,</hi> which is only the spirit, That quickeneth &amp; maketh aliue, as is heretofore rehearsed.</p>

and haue euer after borne an inward loue towardes their holie ghostlie fathers, euen as though it were to their owne husbands.</p>

                  <hi>Goe and shewe thy selfe to the Priest, and offer thine offering accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as Moises hath commaunded.</hi> For that is onely thus to be vnderstood: <hi>Goe hence and shriue thy selfe vnto thine owne Ghostly Father, and doe such pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as he shall enioyne you.</hi> And the like,<note place="margin">Iames. 5.26.</note> where Saint Iames saith, <hi>Confesse your sinnes one to an other,</hi> By that did Iames meane nothing else, but onely <hi>seeke you out a Priest or a Frier, to whom you

And wherfore shuld she not? For, seing that a simple priest can w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fiue words, of a little round cake, make a God: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray you, should not a Bishop or a Suffragane make of a goodly gilded I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage a God also? That were to put little trust in our deare mother the holy church. Therfore we must remain stedfast vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the common opinion and iudgement of our deare mother the holy church of Rome. For a final end, the Heretiks do vs greate wrong to call vs seruers of false Gods,
<pb facs="tcp:20494:248"/>
worshippers of Images and Idolaters, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the Iewes do, who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not find in their hartes, to bestow any honester name vppon vs. And therefore saith Maister <hi>Gentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> that some good people, which see de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per into the matter, mistrust that these He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiks should haue some secret intelligence w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Iewes: yea, should play bootie &amp; be in pension with them, to maintein frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuersation with them, yet he addeth vnto it, that he for his part doth not beleeue any such thing, whereby it seemeth, that he woulde herein a little flatter and annoynte their mouthes with Honie, to please them withall: but it is not so, for hee speaketh in this behalfe, as doth become a good and stoute Catholike subiecte of the holy church of Rome. And besides that, he should haue done these Heretikes a great deale to much worship, if he shoulde haue yoked them in a Waggon, with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Iewes, who (as wee haue heretofore plainly set foorth) are the very best founders and chiefest fountaines and welsprings of all the ceremonies, and insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the holy Church of Rome.</p>
               <p>It is verie true, that our deare mother
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:20494:248"/>
hath amended them, and brought them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a better order, for that her wisdome and vnderstanding doeth farre exceede the wisedome of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath shee in place of one temple of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> caused to be builded vppon moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and hilles, and other hie places, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue a hundred thousand: and in place of three or foure altars, which they had, shee hath set vp so manie, that they are not all to be told ouer in seuentie yeres. Although in deede (as before is rehearsed) the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and paterne doeth proceede from the Iewes, and is borrowed of them: which shadowes and figures our deare mother hath followed verie diligentlie.<note place="margin">Heb. 9. through<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out.

               </p>
               <p>Therefore, whereas these Heretikes will (with the Apostle to the Hebrewes) defende and say, that all the figures and shadowes of the olde Testament were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and cleane taken away by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ, and ought not to be vsed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie more, is rancke heresie.

               <p>It is most true, that the Iewes doe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise call vs <hi>Worshippers of false gods, and idolaters,</hi> that is, <hi>Prayers to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> and doe herein agree with these He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes: but they are therein to bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orne withall. For they haue learned it of olde out of their Bible, and also out of their Prophetes, who knewe nothing at all yet, of the goodly and Hellishe (I forget my selfe, I should haue said holy) or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Popes of Rome: neither
<pb facs="tcp:20494:251"/>
did they vnderstande, that the images must bee prayed vnto and worshipped, euen as the thing, after which they are made and fashioned.</p>
               <p>For Saint Thomas <hi>de Aquino,</hi> that heauenly English Doctor, was not yet in place for to teache such thinges, neither had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they yet hearde any tidinges of our Saintes, nor of all the miracles which they doe, nor that the milde Empresse <hi>Irene</hi> had not yet scratcht out her sonnes eyes, to bring to passe (by the good assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce of the seconde councell of <hi>Nice</hi>) the woorshipping of images againe. And therefore the Prophetes knewe not yet the difference that is betwixt <hi>Latria,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Looke the .13. Chap. of the second part.</note> 
                  <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> and <hi>Hyperdulia</hi>: and therefore did they condemne all such, as did pray to any images, for woorshippers of false goddes, without making any difference or exception betweene the Catholikes and the Heathen.</p>
               <p>And now, when the Iewes doe reade the same, they thinke that the Prophetes did speake as well of our deare mother the holie Church, as of their forefathers. And then that which the Prophet Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie saith:<note place="margin">Iere. 7.17.</note> 
                  <hi>That they did offer Cakes

But these heretikes doe knowe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, their olde shooes doe knowe, that the Prophetes speake to the Iewes, and not to vs. For wee were yet vnborne, and therefore wee may not seeme to take it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs: for he that is not ytchie hath no neede to scratche, and he that is not scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, hath no neede to clawe.

And it is not to be thought, that they shoulde haue any secrete confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the Iewes, as Maister <hi>Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> hath verie learnedly considered and noted, yet hath he dealt verie grossely in one point, where he doth so spitefully blame the Iewes, for their golden Calfe, saying,<note place="margin">Golden Calfe.</note> that our deare mother the holie Church of Rome hath neuer beene brought vnto so great a follie as that. Truely, if this had not proceeded from him euen of a pure and
<pb facs="tcp:20494:252"/>
simple Catholike zeale, it might almost be taken for a blasphemie and an heresie.</p>
               <p>For although it bee verie true, that the holie Churche hath no golden Calfe: yet hath shee not therefore forgotten to follow herein the trace and footesteppes of the Iewes, her good schoolemaisters. For in place of that that Aaron the high Priest once halowed the golden Calfe, our deare mother hath ordeined and set foorth, that the Pope of Rome (who vndoubtedly is established in Aarons place) shall yeerely hallow and blesse a certeine number of lambes of waxe, which he doeth call <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Dei,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  </note> that is to say, <hi>The lambe of God</hi>: or, <hi>The sonne of God, which hath taken away the sinnes of the worlde: and being slaine as a lambe for vs, hath released vs from the bondage of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, euen as Aaron and the Iewes did name their Calfe: The God which had deliuered them out of the slauerie of the land of Aegypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, although that a Calfe is better than a lambe, and golde of muche greater value than waxe: yet our holie father the Pope of Rome hath suche a
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:20494:252"/>
notable deuise of Alcamistrie, that he will for these lambes bring good fatte Oxen into his kitchin, and lumpes of golde which will not bee muche lesse woorthe than the golden Calfe of the Iewes: for the power of these lambes is so great, that it is vnspeakable. And that may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued out of the Latine verses whiche Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> did once send with fiue such <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> to the Emperour of <hi>Graecia,</hi>

Thereafter hath she yet foure or fiue of the right sponges, wherewithall Christ was refreshed with vineger,<note place="margin">Sponges.</note> which she deuout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie doeth licke and kisse, and reserues for a singular relique. Moreouer, shee hath the verie naturall tayle of the Asse whereon he rode,<note place="margin">The Asse taile. The Manger.</note> and the same Manger wherein hee laie, whereof she makes great store. But what is all this to be compared by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence which she doeth shewe to the holie Crosse? For admit shee doeth worship fiue or sixe Speares, and some Nailes, yet will she not worship all the speares, which are vsed in the warres, nor all the nailes which are made in the smithes forges, nor all the sponges which growe in the sea, nor yet al the tailes wherewith the asses are couered behind, nor all the mangers wherein hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses haue their prouender, (like as she doth permit to worship all the crosses which can be made) for then you should counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feite the Ape to nigh: yet may it seeme strange to some, whether all other reliques or holy things haue pist against the moone
<pb facs="tcp:20494:258"/>
because they cannot atteine to the like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment. For all the roddes of right might challenge the same priuilege, in worship of the rod wherewith Christ was scourged, and al ropes in worship of that with which he was bound, &amp; all haithornes in worship of the thornes wherewith he was crowned. But it behoues them to be content w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their portion, for they are sufficientlie prouided for: &amp; if sobeit the holy church doth please to attribute more to the crosse, it proceedes of her meere liberalitie, and of the special loue which shee doeth beare to the same, which for the same cause shee reuerenceth more than the verie body of Christ, which did hang on the crosse, or than his bloud which he hath spilt on the crosse. For wee can not perceiue, that in reuerence of the bodie of Christ, all bodies, &amp; much lesse, all similitudes or likenesses of the bodie are had in reuerence or worship: like as not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie all crosses, but all figures &amp; likenesses of the crosse are worshipped, reuerenced, kist, and lickt in reuerence of that onelie crosse whereon his bodie did hang. But it hath thus pleased our louing mother the holie church: and not without most great and waightie occasions: for without doubt, the likenes of the holie crosse is of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:20494:258"/>
of such great power &amp; singular vertue, that the deuill doeth take it for a bulbegger, and flies from it, as a dogge doeth from a piece of bacon. Like as euidentlie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the golden Legend of Saint Christopher: and in a number of other legendes, where almost for feare hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raied his breech, so soone as a crosse was made. And it is also the cudgell where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was once beaten, like as wee may plainlie see on all altars, &amp; in processions, where our Sauiour is counterfeited knoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with a crosse vpon the gates of hell, at which all the deuils runne awaye as though they were possessed. Moreouer, it is the token with the which God hath created heauen &amp; earth: and that is it which Esai would say (according to the expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our holy mother the church) saying thus: <hi>Who hath holden the waters in his fist? Who hath measured heauen with his spanne, &amp; hath comprehended all the worlde in their measures? Who hath wayed the mountaines &amp; hilles in a balance?</hi> Which is to say, that God did (with three fingers) make a crosse, when hee created heauen and earth. Item, our holie mother the church saith besides, <hi>That
<pb facs="tcp:20494:259"/>
Moses did with the figure of the crosse change the bitternes of the waters in the wildernesse, and caused the water to flowe out of the stonie rocke.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the scripture doth not make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of anie crosse, but onelie of a rod wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall Moses did strike: yet our mother the holy church hath thus expounded the same, supposing that Moses did the like to the Bishops now, who with their staffe do make a crosse &amp; so blesse the people. Shee hath also fained, that those which do sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle their thresholdes with the bloud of the Paschal lambe, &amp; theron set the figure of a crosse, that the striking Angel by meanes of the crosse doeth passe by it, like as wee haue out of their sequences, (which they vpon the crosse dayes, named <hi>Inuentio S. crucis,</hi> signe) here aboue rehearsed.

she is yet called at this day, Our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Loretta, howbeit, she could not abide to staie there long, for that (by reason of the great accesse of people) many murders and robberies chanced: for which cause she remoued againe, &amp; caused her closet to be borne vnto an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mounteine or hill, which appertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto two brethren, which for the lucre or gaine which they receiued by her, fell at variance, &amp; agreed like dogs and cattes together, so that she would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshe remoue againe: and seemed in a manner to haue a flie in her taile, being vnable to remaine in one place. In sum, the Angels did remoue this closet again from thence, and did bring it vppon a common highway, where it doth yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to this houre, without any ground hold or foundations, by reason that the foundations were left at Nazareth.

that this Ladie is greatly desirous of glorie and honour, and coueteth to bee accepted and worshipped for the Queene of Heauen, and also to haue the preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence before all the Saintes of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise: For shee is of an other disposition than the holy Virgin Marie (the mother of Iesus Christ) was,<note place="margin">Luke. <hi>1.48.</hi>

There are yet many more &amp; sundrie of such like proofes of scripture, which woulde bee to tedious to rehearse: But because the Heretikes doe deride them, and will vnderstand them according to the literall sense, and after the Greeke and Hebrewe text: I knowe no better meane to dispute with them, then with a good fagot.</p>
               <p>Yet will I adde thus much more, That when they haue a sute to a King or migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Prince, they knowe verie well,<note place="margin">This is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kius and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Catholike writers.</note> that first they must speake and sue for helpe of some of the Lords, who may broach their cause, and by their intreatie, be a meane for them

and so to further their sute, which conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they ought not so rudely to encroche vpon the king of all kinges, without first to haue spoken with one of his court.

Wherefore wee will more deepely consider this point, and warily weigh the reasons which haue moued him herevnto. So that wee haue then here to consider vppon two pointes: Namely, the first is that which Dauid saith,<note place="margin">Psal. 69.10.</note> 
                  <hi>That the zeale of the house of the Lorde hath euen eaten him,</hi> Which is euen here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in <hi>Gentianus.</hi> For he is so hottely inflamed with the zeale of the holie Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Churche, that he is in a manner asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied and amased, so as he doeth not see what he saieth. In the meane while not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:20494:279"/>
doeth he recorde and call to minde that whiche our holy mother the Churche of Rome hath concluded in the councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> and the same time did put in practise, when the holie fathers there congregated did permit <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> and <hi>Hierom of Prage</hi> to be burnt, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the letters of safeconduite, whiche were graunted and giuen them by the Emperour and the saide councell, ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning most firmely, that it should bee no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to breake promise with Heretikes. Yet perhappes our <hi>Gentianus</hi> hath read in Cicero, <hi>That a mans faith or promise is stedfastnesse or vowed truth, of that which he pretendes to doe or speake.</hi> Therefore he feareth (as wee may iudge) that if he should say nothing but a truth, he might bee reputed and taken for a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressour of the ordinances of the foresaide councell, as though he had vndertaken the faith of the Heretikes.</p>
               <p>Moreouer,<note place="margin">Lies to a good intent.</note> the holie Church hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented and ordeined, that sometimes a lie may be inuented against Heretikes, for a good intent, as to fraie simple people from desire to reade their bookes, least thereby they should fall into their heresies. And
<pb facs="tcp:20494:280"/>
that this be true, appeares first by strong prouebable reasons: &amp; further by credible examples. The reasons are these: <hi>That the holie Church hath ordeined &amp; conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (like as yet by the daily exercise ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares) that it is not ill done, to make the people beleeue many fables &amp; Cau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:20494:280"/>
prouoke people to deuotion, muche more then is it tollerable to rehearse some odde and strange iestes of Heretikes, as to wit, that they are blacke and foule fauoured, and worke matters with the diuell, with such like thinges, to affright people from the studie of their doctrine. Now the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are also verie sure &amp; waightie. For vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such like lies, which the holy supposses or subiects of the Romishe Churche, hath persuaded Emperours &amp; Kings to beleue, were they permitted to make their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cards &amp; priuileges against the <hi>Lutherians</hi> &amp; <hi>Huguenotes,</hi> wherby such controuersies &amp; tumultes are growen &amp; sprong vp in the world, that it is to be doubted, great bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed will be made before they will be app<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased againe. This may sufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the wordes of the Placard in the reigne of the Emperour Charles of noble memorie,<note place="margin">Placardes of Charles the .5.</note> set forth in the yeere .1521. at the citie of Wormes, declaring expresly, <hi>That Luther was a Pelagian, and did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainefullie contemne the Saintes.

               </p>
               <p>Beholde, these be the verie wordes of the Emperours acte, and this is the verie first &amp; originall welspring of all the bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, which hath happened throughout all Christendome for the space of seuen and fortie yeeres, vntill this present time, the which all men may both see with their eyes, and in a manner feele with their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to be most grosse, blockishe, and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable lies, which <hi>Petrusa Sotto</hi> (the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours good ghostly father) and other Catholike Priestes did blowe in at his

For otherwise, if they might haue mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested naught but a troth, then shoulde the Heretikes haue founde audience by Kinges and Princes: the plaie had been made, and all thinges woulde haue gone a wrie with Priestes and Poperie, Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and suche tromperie of the Romishe Churche: yea, the whole Spiritualtie would not haue beene worthe a beane, like as wee may perceiue in all places where these Heretikes haue had hearing, and where they haue beene permitted to plead their cause openly.</p>

               <p>But yet haue ye another commoditie whiche groweth by this kinde of sacred dealing. For if Priestes and Monkes were bound alwayes to preache the truth, there woulde ensue a great disgrace vnto them, for that they woulde oftentimes in their pulpettes become as dumb as fishes, being vnable to bring foorth any thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are all vnfortunate in declaring the trueth, and therefore shoulde misse the meane to vtter their excellent giftes of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led eloquence. But when they haue no more arrowes lefte in their quiuers, then doe they fall vppon the Heretikes, and haue store of matter to talke of, yea wonderfull things to declare against them: they rage, they rore, they thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, they lighten, &amp; make them so blacke &amp; deformed like diuels in hell. Sometime they catch a <hi>Caluin</hi> by the throte, sometime <hi>Beza,</hi> sometime their quarell is against Marottes Psalmes: sometime with the Greeke and Hebrewe texte, whiche in no sauce they can abide: sometime they martyr the Catechisme so pitifully, as though they had it on a racke.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:20494:283"/>To be briefe, they regard neither doore nor post, but shoote their shaftes vp to the feathers in it. They prattle like Pies, and seeme in a manner as they had soulde all their potte herbes, and yet reserue of the best to themselues, that is truely a sport and pretie pastime: specially to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute women, which are not greatly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Bible, or Gods worde, but rather listen to the Popes lies, and to daunse after his pipe, or to heare some Gospell of a distaffe, and tale of a tubbe. In fine, a man would verily iudge, that such Catholike preachers had beene all their dayes Pedlers or pelting Apothecaries of Dutchlande, or that they had farmed the prattle courte wholly to themselues. Like as daily may bee perceiued at all their Sermons, and specially at the woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Sermon, which a goodly grayfrier doeth vsually make in Frenche at <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpe in S.

               <p>Yet can I not forget, nor let slippe out of memorie, that pretious Sermon of the reuerend Bishop of <hi>Vtrecht,</hi> which he

               <head>The ii. Chapter.

               <p>Secondarilie, the Heretikes will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and complaine their neede, but to God onelie, nor call vpon anie but him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, as though none but hee could helpe them, or that he were at leasure, and had nought else to doe, but iust to heare what they would say vnto him.

                  <pb facs="tcp:20494:288"/>After this, they will not pray anie thing, for (forsouth) it must first be found prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the Scripture, forasmuch as <hi>To pray without faith</hi> (say they) <hi>is sinne:</hi>

               <p>Moreouer, they will not pray otherwise than in their own mother tongue, or in such a language as them selues do vnderstand, as though our God did not vnderstand La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin: or at least, that they them selues ought to vnderstand that which they say. They build vpon Paule,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. throughout the whole chapter.</note> who forbiddeth to pray in an vnknowen tongue.

And, which is worst of all, they will not pray, neither through the merites of Saintes, nor through the vertue of holie water, of the holie oyle, of sanctified bread, of Palmes, <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> holie Reliques, nor through the merites of holie dayes which they haue obserued, neither through the merites of their fasting, or anie world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie thing else, but onelie through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of the onelie sacrifice or oblation of Iesus Christ, being offered vpon the crosse to God the Father: yea, they make a iest of all such matters, &amp; condemne them for meere superstition and idolatrie.

in so much, that at <hi>Antwerpe</hi> (when pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique preaching of the Gospell was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted) it hath bene firmelie found by the impost and taxes of drinke, that these holie dayes haue bene neglected: where through the Almoners found them selues likewise much greeued, because they did not receiue such summes of money, as they were wont to doe by brokes of those which in their drunkenesse were wont to wound and slaie eche other: for so much as the Heretikes did not celebrate these festiuall dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the olde order of the Romish Church.

               <head>The ii. Chapter. Of the great knowledge &amp; holines of Priestes &amp; Monks.</head>
               <p>BVt I pray you let vs heare, whereat he doth so much loath. Hee saith first, that they are the most ignorant and the moste
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:20494:298"/>
vnlearned, which are to bee founde in the world: &amp; after that, that they are likewise of a wicked life. But before he doth come so far, he doth aboue al, protest, <hi>That there is in some Priests &amp; Monkes, &amp; other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious persons, a certaine excessiue and beastly ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. yea, that some do lead a verie lewde life.</hi> Which he doth handle verie wisely &amp; circumspectly, to the end we should the sooner beleeue him to desire a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, aswell as others do. Like as we may lightly gather hereof (according as himselfe doth witnes) that he hath expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the sixth article of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of <hi>Calce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donie,</hi> &amp; permitted the same to bee extant in print. Is not this a great matter, &amp; an vnfallible token, that he meanes the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the mind? He hath assuredly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued hereby a fatt benefice, or a Bishops myter. Yet doe I not regard so much the first point, that there are such ignorant Priestes, which cannot reade their Masse nor Dirige bokes. And if they can do that, what neede they any further? Therfore is <hi>Gentian</hi> to blame, to esteme them vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: howbeit, I surmise he hath done thus, to shew that he hath learned <hi>Rhetorica,</hi> or <hi>The arte of eloquence and vtterance.
<pb facs="tcp:20494:299"/>
For thereby is learned, That if we seeke greatlie to rebuke any man, it cannot be done more aptlie, than by dilating and amplifying his default, in comparing him to some one, who hath bene tainted with the like.</hi> For, as touching the Monkes, it is no maruell, though they are vnlearned, seeing their profession doeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the same: and the more ignorant they bee, the welcomer and more acceptable are they to their Couent. For those which are verie well learned, haue commonlie to much tongue, and therefore are often pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished: and if then they do not mend, they are throwen into a dungeon, or are closed somewhere betwixt two walles in a seller, and there permit them to liue so long as they can. Like as might haue bene seene a yeere ago at <hi>Antwerpe, Ghaunt,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places more, which haue remained there, some eight or ten yeeres, some twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and thirtie yeeres. Therefore it is no maruell, though Monkes be vnlearned: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as in the Latin tongue is vsed a common prouerbe: <hi>Monacho indoctior,</hi> that is to say, <hi>A great Asse or dolt, and more vnlearned than a Monke.</hi> Yea, they haue a speciall Latin tongue for their own
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:20494:299"/>
vse, which the learned sorte them selues can not vnderstand, and is called,<note place="margin">Friers latin.</note> 
                  <hi>Friers latin, or, Kitchen latin.</hi> But touching Priestes, they neede no great learning: for, if they can but onelie repeate the fiue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete wordes of the Masse without giuing <hi>Priscian or Despauter</hi> a bobbe on the face (that is to say,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Priscian or Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pauterie</hi> were men, which wrote the latin Grammer, or the rules for the latin to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue. And therfore it is vsuallie said, that those whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che speake false latin, do strike <hi>Pris. and Despau.</hi> on the face.</note> without intermingling of Friers latin) than is the matter cocke sure: They are more learned then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in heauen: for they can make God, which thing the Angels can not doe. And if besides that, they knowe but howe to brewe of the smallest sort of latin withall, then hath their sowe pigd, they may bee bold to inuite their neighbors to the feast, and serue out messes with the great Laten ladell: for then they may not onelie bee pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Priestes, but also Bishops, Prelates, Cardinals, yea Popes them selues. And what more can they craue? For, touching their life, we must alwayes coniecture the best, like as is commaunded in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and not to thinke that those which dailie do handle God,<note place="margin">This is openlie commaunded in the Decrees cap. <hi>in scriptis,</hi> dist. 96.</note> would commit anie thing, that is not to be allowed. <hi>Therfore, if a Priest do kisse a maid, or grope her about the pappes, we must suppose, that
<pb facs="tcp:20494:300"/>
he is about to shrieue her, or doeth giue her absolution for her sinnes. And if so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be any man doth take them ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie with the manner, he must couer, or lap them about with his own cloake, lest he make them ashamed.</hi> For they are euen by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture verie shamefast, &amp; change collour, like a pewter platter: otherwise may not anie correct or punish the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as is shewed before) w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the expressed wordes of the Sodomites, which would not be corrected of Loth: yea although they were the veriest smelsmocks which might liue.

                  </note> who before was named <hi>Rodorike Borgia</hi>: and being Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall sought by all meanes possible, to waxe Pope: finding in the ende no waye more commodious to atchieue the same, than by framing him selfe to the studie and exercise of Necromancie or black science: which art he most diligentlie did applie, &amp; thereby examined the diuels, whether they would willinglie and without grudging, prefer him to the Popelie crowne. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto they presentlie consented, with condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he should be sworne to be subiect and seruiceable in all matters vnto them: wherevnto with right good will hee also did condescend: desiring onelie, that when this compact should be confirmed, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell should not appeare in any fearful like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to demaunde the accomplishment of his othe, but should shewe him selfe in the habit and semblance of a <hi>Protonotarie.</hi> The diuell (who could not haue wished a better vizard) was soone intreated to shew him that pleasure.

in a sommer parler, or place of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, where byding alone, his lord the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonotarie</hi> came also treading in, in the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of a comelie middleaged man, seemely apparelled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the habit of a priest. And hauing taken the oth of the Cardinal according to his wish and prescribing, did assure him to become Pope: &amp; that agreed verie friendlie vpon the time wherein <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi> should reigne as Pope, to wit, <hi>1108.</hi> In fine <hi>Borgia</hi> was made Pope, and gaue himself throughly to al maner of pleasure &amp; desire of his flesh. Hee laye with his owne daughter named <hi>Lucretia,</hi> whiche neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles was vsed in like case the same time by his sonne her owne brother, called <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentin Borgia</hi>: insomuch as of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he did not onlie make his bride, but also his daughter in law, like as her Epitaph (extant on her graue) doeth expreslie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. Hee caused likewise the good man <hi>Hieronymus Sauonarola</hi> to bee burnt at <hi>Florence,</hi> because hee did boldlie preache against his wicked life and doctrine. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, hee did couenant and agree with the <hi>Marranes,</hi> which is, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked Christians.

with his owne handes, as also thorough the meane of his aforesaid sonne <hi>Valentin,</hi> who had raised a commotion through all <hi>Italie,</hi> and had brought <hi>Iacobus Caieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> the Cardinal <hi>Vrsin,</hi> and the Abbatte <hi>Aluiane,</hi> with manie other more, to their ende. Hee would at last at a banket (which verie liberallie hee had prepared) haue poysoned a Cardinall: So it chaunced, that through mistaking the one bottell for the other, hee which filled the drinke, did serue the poyson to the Pope him selfe: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as hee therewith did swell, and became exceeding sicke. The while nowe, that good counsell with him was deare and farre to seeke, he sent one of his most trustie seruauntes called <hi>Modena,</hi> into a studie ioyning next to a chamber where he laye in bedde, to fetche a prettie golden booke of Necromancie, which hee had alwayes most carefullie kept amongest his costlie and chiefest iewels. And as the aforesaid seruaunt mas entring into the studie, he sawe the aforenamed <hi>Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notarie</hi> sitting in the Popelie habit, who did so well resemble his maister in all respectes, as if it had bene him selfe.
<pb facs="tcp:20494:325"/>
Whereat being greatlie frighted, and in a manner halfe dead through feare, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire backe, vntill his maister the Pope had reuiued him againe, and then aduenturing the second time to enter the studie, was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of the Diuell, what he had there to do, who answered, that the Pope had sent him for a booke. Then roared the diuell with a terrible noyse, and cried out: <hi>I am Pope my selfe</hi>: wherewith he vanished away. After the which time, the Pope began to hasten toward his end. Yet a litle before his death, did his maister appeare once more in likenesse of a Poste or Purseuant, and hauing had long conference &amp; a longer discourse with him, did teache him his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick, or his table of numbring, effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuallie giuing to vnderstand, that eleuen &amp; eight did signifie eleuen yeares and eight dayes, and not nineteene yeares, so as the Pope had reckoned without his host. And then with a filthie stinck he departed from my lord the Pope, who immediatlie after followed, and with his faithfull maisters departed this world into the Popes hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.

               <p>After that, he is a kinne likewise to those of the second eight quarters, forsomuch as he was not simplie a whoremonger, but besides the women which he defiled, being the Popes Legate, was by his kinsman <hi>Nicholas Querceo,</hi> taken with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whereas he beeing a bedde with his owne cousine germane <hi>Laura Fernesia,</hi>

                     <l>Why Leo, at his dying day,</l>

                     <l>What other cause did lette, (I pray?)</l>

               <p>But if promotions and benefices were onelie to be solde for monie and bribes, then were our deare mother the holy church to be borne with, and not greatly to bee blamed.

But when the Pope had satisfied his desire with her, and did not paie the hat, the good man did despaire, &amp; got him selfe away into a Catholike cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster or religious house.</p>
               <p>Such merchandize is a dailie thrift to the Romish Pilates and holy fathers.

            <p>And the second, namelie: The expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Scripture: wherein eache may see with eyes, that howbeit the <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes</hi> and <hi>Lutheranes</hi> do alwayes referre them to the text of the holy Scripture, yet our deare &amp; louing mother the holy church
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:20494:346"/>
can so aptlie handle the said text, that shee maketh it so fitte and pliable, as it doeth wholie bende and stretche to her aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>Then reade the same, and accept our paines in good worth: and considering the grounded reasons of all commotions and insurrections, which from fourtie yeeres hitherwarde haue bene in Christendome, for causes of Religion and Gods seruice, pray vnto God, that he, for his Sonne Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ his sake, will shortlie appeare, &amp; with the breath of his mouth, and force of his holie Spirit, consume and destroy the wicked wasters, and falsifiers of his holie worde and doctrine, to the glorie of his most holy name, and the edifying of his Church and Congregation.</p>
            <p>But seeing that here aboue in this our Bee hiue of the Romishe Churche, wee haue often and in sundrie places repeated, that with manie ragges and patches it is botcht and sowed togeather, and selected from diuers and sundrie sortes of flowres and herbes, to make the honnie sweete, wee will for thy delight and for the further declaration &amp; confirmation of that whiche
<pb facs="tcp:20494:347"/>
is said, dilate and more amplie declare the condition and propertie, or rather commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of our <hi>Bee hiue,</hi> the original, disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nature, cunning, and capeable capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of our Bees, in their honie and honie combes, their rule and regimentes, with all things appertaining: to the end it may be knowen wherein they doe agree with our common sorte of Honie Bees, and in what respect they disagree &amp; decline from them. In which treatie, we will presentlie followe with the description of Bees, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> in Greeke, <hi>Varro, Colu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mella, Virgil</hi> and <hi>Plinie</hi> in Latine, haue wittilie written, and for our learning left behinde them. But because none shall thinke, that we will in anie respect be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious to the holie Romish Church, forso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as we compare her holinesse and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable foundation, to Bees, and a Bee hiue, I will first and before all other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, rehearse the high prayse and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation which shee her selfe doeth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute vnto them.

And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they are conuersant also amongest people, and frankly bestowe their honie, yet bee they more solitarie and straunger than the other, and therefore are called with the Greeke worde <hi>Monachi,</hi> that is to say, dwelling solitarie or by them selues and are knowen from other, by a hoode which they weare on their heads. Wee will tearme the first tame Bees: and these wilde Bees.<note place="margin">Tame Bees. Wilde Bees.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, they are both diuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:20494:352"/>
foure manner of sortes or kindes,<note place="margin">4. sorts of Bees</note> after the description of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Columel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</hi> Of which, the verie best are thicke and round: they make the most honie,<note place="margin">Thicke and sanguine co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured.</note> &amp; keepe companie next to their king, amongest which the most excellent are of a sanguine colour, as though they had redde scarlet winges. These tend the king, &amp; are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie by his side, being of both kindes, wilde and tame: the other are of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde and sundrie sortes, with more varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: but howe much the neerer they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche to the king, so much the thicker &amp; rounder they commonlie growe.</p>
               <p>The second kinde or sort resemble and are like to Waspes, Horseflies, and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets:<note place="margin">Like waspes.</note> they make not so much honie as the first, because they come not of so good a kinde. Notwithstanding, they labour ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestlie, and bring also much honie into the Hiue. They are in a manner of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and nature of Horseflies &amp; Hornets, sauing that they loue not so well to flie and seize on horses and kine, as they doe on sheepe. Wherin they digresse cleane from the nature of the ordinarie Honiebees, which do carefullie shunne the sheepe, for
<pb facs="tcp:20494:353"/>
feare, lest they should intangle them selues, and sticke in their fleeces. But these haue a good remedie for that, for they first bite away their wooll after that their skinne, &amp; lastely do sucke their bloude, to which they are wonderfullie addicted: and therefore (of many) are called bitesheepe, or for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uities sake, Bishoppes. There are also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst these, which are as profitable in the Beehiue, as any other, by reason of their fearcenesse, for they haue verie fearce and murthering stinges, insomuch as those being stoung by them, canne hardely escape death. For the wound can not bee remedied with any thing, but with golden salue: they are of the generation of Wasps, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Plinie</hi> do name in Greeke <hi>Ichneumones,</hi> which may bee interpreted Inquisitors, or after the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine phrase <hi>Inquisitores,</hi> and after the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Plinie</hi> are so called, because with greate industrie and diligence, they know to seeke and catch the flies, and bite off their heades, permitting them to liue of that which remaines: howebeit, these our <hi>Ichneumones</hi> do moste couet the woll and bloud of sheepe, and are maruellous bloudethirstie. They are like wise of both
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:20494:353"/>
kindes, some tame, some wilde: But the wilde are alwaies more fearce and deadly. They are bredde or ingendred, after the same order, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> doeth declare of his <hi>Ichneumones</hi>: namely, they take verie venimous spiders, named <hi>Phalan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giae,</hi> (which are found ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifullie in <hi>Spaine</hi> at the olde Inquisitors walles and postes) and carrie those to their holes: and after they haue greased them a good with filthe and durte (wherevnto ours vse commonly Popes grease) then do they set or broode o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them, and after that sorte increase their kinde.</p>
               <p>The thirde sorte is by <hi>Arlem</hi> named <hi>Pheres,</hi>

                     <hi>Pheres.</hi>
                  </note> which signifies as much as theues and rouers, because they are of an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding theeuish disposition, and haue a great large and broade belly commonly blacke to see to. These deuoure greate store of honnie, and loue exceedingly well the smacke of Prebends and fatte beneficed honie, whiche the Bee Apothecaries do tearme in Latine <hi>Veneficia</hi>: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are called <hi>Veneficiati,</hi> or veneficed. They are for the most parte tame, yet there are founde not a fewe, which are of the wilde and straunge disposition.
<pb facs="tcp:20494:354"/>
And they are separated amongest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, each ouer a seuerall office &amp; charge, according as the king hath appointed them. For some haue nothing else to doe, but with an irksome buzing by day and night do swarme in their hiue. But they knowe their rule, how and when they shall swarme, and are for that cause called <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulares,</hi> or by a Greeke worde <hi>Canonici.</hi> Some are appointed eache ouer his honi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combe apart, which they call Parishes, by reason whereof they are called Parishe Priests. The other are as Presidents in the conuocation house, &amp; haue eache about ten Bees vnder their iurisdiction, whereof they are called in Greeke <hi>Decani:</hi> which in our tongue doth signifie the tenth men, or Capteines ouer ten.</p>
               <p>Touching the wilde sorte of Bees, some are called fathers, or w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a <hi>Chaldean</hi> word <hi>Abbas,</hi> because they beare rule ouer the other Bees, like a father ouer his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Some keepers, or after the Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and French phrase, <hi>Gardians.</hi> Some are called the first, or in Latine <hi>Priores.</hi> Some Controllers, or in Latine <hi>Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciales:</hi> eache after his state and calling, &amp; according to the rule and dominion which
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:20494:354"/>
he beareth ouer the other common Bees, which common Bees make the fourth and last heape or kinde of Bees, according to <hi>Aristotles</hi> declaration, and are named in Greeke <hi>Cephenes,</hi> and in Latine <hi>Fungi,</hi> that is after our language, Buzzardes or Drones. These are the most vnprofitable Bees, and yet the most in number: they haue no sting, and will not worke, but liue on the labour of the other, and chieflie the wilde Bees, amongst the which some flie swarming from doore to doore, to finde out baightes to fill their bagges: and therefore are called <hi>Mendicantes,</hi> that is to say, Beggers, or begging bees: because they are of the begging order of Bees. But the tame Drones do not flie so from house to house, but tarrie in their Bee hiue, &amp; there get their commons with swarming, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out labouring, or doing anie good. For when they would doe anie good, then doe they commonlie misse, and are also for that cause called Missebees, or Masse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees.</p>
               <p>And these are the foure chiefest sortes &amp; kindes of our Bees, agreeing verie fitlie with the descriptions of <hi>Aristotle</hi> &amp; <hi>Plinie.</hi> For touching certein wormes (wherof they

For he saith, that whensoeuer the Bees come not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but remaine still wormes, then are they called <hi>Clerus,</hi> which falles out in like order with our Bees: for amongest them are none called <hi>Clerici,</hi> but those whiche beginne to fledge, and haue a white spot on their heads, which seemes to bee a white worme, as <hi>Plinie</hi> saieth. And if so be it, they remaine still in that state, without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to further order or degree of Bees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then are they esteemed and accounted as of an vnperfect creation, and haue no other name but <hi>Clerici,</hi> and the white spot which they beare on their heads, <hi>Tonsura Cleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calis.</hi>

               <p>IN their rule they resemble the common sorte of Honie bees, for they haue all one king: yea can not abide without a king, whom they call <hi>Papa,</hi> as if one should say,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>This king hath a sting in like maner, but
<pb facs="tcp:20494:356"/>
he doeth not occupie him selfe abroad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause al other Bees are prest to do him ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, in whatsoeuer it pleaseth him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund. And like as this king of Honie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees hath a spot on his head: so likewise doeth he carrie a token or marke on his head, like a triple crowne: howbeit, all the other Bees (as hath bene said) do beare in like maner a round white spot in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of their heades, in manner of a crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net. They flie all at once about this king, and shewe themselues verie meeke and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient towards him. Hee goeth seldome abroad, but when he doeth determine to go forth any whither, it may be perceiued lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g before, by the swarming and humming of the forerunners. For whensoeuer he goeth out, the whole swarme followeth round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and oftentimes they carrie him on their shoulders, like as the honie Bees doe carrie their king.</p>
               <p>He hath likewise certeine loiterers by him, and Seruitours which garde him, and some other of the verie best, which bee of a ruddie or sanguine colour, &amp; remaine alwayes next to his side, and are for that cause named <hi>Laterales,</hi> or a <hi>Latere.</hi>

In summe, each one would faine be next: for that is reputed for great honour: where he settles, there is the host of the whole swarme and staple of the honnie and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie combe: and such as dwell many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth miles thence, bend notwithstanding their flght thitherwards: who so euer hath him to friend, shall in like manner finde friendshippe of all the whole swarme: when they lose him, then is all their porridge spilte, and sporte at an end: For they creepe pensiuelie to their selles and closets, and there buzze or swarme so longe and so much, till they haue gotten an other. And if by mishappe it chaunceth, that there bee twoe or three kings, (like as hath often hath bin seene,) then falles out great schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and troubles among them, and they bee at mortall warres together: yea, cease not, till the one or the other bee dispatcht &amp; made away: like as <hi>Virgil</hi> hath finely set forth.</p>

               <p>THese Bees in their labour resemble much the common sort of honiebees, for they cease also from worke in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time, &amp; when it is foule weather. They intend not to labor, onles first the Beanes do bud, and hauing once begun, they cease
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:20494:357"/>
not so long as faire weather continueth, iust as <hi>Plinie</hi> doth write of the other bees. But herein they differ from the other, in that they cannot make anie freshe or newe honiecombes: but it must be made to their handes, by certeine other Apothecaries, which are skilfull in the same, &amp; make the honiecombe after this sorte: They take two or three vnces of honiedeawe, whiche falleth from heauen vpon the Prophetical and Apostolicall beanes, &amp; is commonlie called, <hi>Manna coeleste,</hi> or <hi>Drosomeli.</hi> It was wont to be found plentifullie in <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria,</hi> but nowe it is also in <hi>Germanie, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and <hi>Fraunce</hi>: yea also verie rife in the Base countries. But this may they not by name put rawe in the hiue: for it would cause the Bees to haue a laske, and would all die of it. Therefore do they hate this excedinglie: insomuch that where they are conuersant, this heauenlie deawe is scarse and harde to bee founde. Therefore the Apothecaries must first temper this honnie deawe in this order: They let it be molten first by a whote fire of Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall seacoales, and after that they doe let it seethe more than the one halfe away, in a thicke and troubled muddie water,
<pb facs="tcp:20494:358"/>

               <p>THese Bees in like manner are not without diseases, like vnto other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Honie bees, and are especiallie trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the laske of the purse, and with the monie dropsie: and then are they quite out of heart: therefore must their Hiue bee often perfumed and smoakt with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named herbes, to witte, with <hi>Argentina Nummularia,</hi> Goldemaries, or Marie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goldes, golde flower, and other such like. The Apothecaries knowe also to make a syrrope, which is verie good against all their diseases, which is this: <hi>Recipe,</hi> A handfull of rootes of Seuen tide herbe, of Rattleflowers, Coggeworth, and Penie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, and beate them with Diuels milke, and sprinkle or mingle the same with the <hi>Quinta essentia</hi> of foolishe mathes.

And if they will not yet cotton, then are they greased againe with oyle: for therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all are they formed and brought to a fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and when they come to be full growen Bees, then must they the thirde time bee salued againe with oyle, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall they come to a full natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and most perfect kinde.</p>

            <p>HErein I thought good to instruct thee, good reader, to the end thou mightest discerne the nature and propertie of these Bees, from the other common honnie Bees: and not to thinke, that in all respectes they agree, but differ in many. But whosoeuer hath any vnderstanding, will perfectly perceiue it of him selfe. Therefore will wee not trouble thee any longer, but make an end of this our Bee hiue: Each reade &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, &amp; specially ponder all the witnesses and allegations which are alledged here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as well out of the Scripture, as other Bookes, I trust he shall reape commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by it. God the Lorde lighten all our hearts with his holy spirit, and keepe vs from all errours, through his euerlasting trueth, wisdome, and Sonne Iesus Christ, to whom belongeth all praise, honor and glorie, with the Father, in the vnitie of the holy Ghost. Amen.</p>
