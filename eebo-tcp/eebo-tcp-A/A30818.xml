            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Sir</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>UPon the occaſion of Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Butlers</hi> comming to <hi>Oxford,</hi> whom I ſhall deſire your Honour to preſent to His Majeſty, as one that carryed himſelfe very bravely in this Action, and tooke three Corners of the Rebells, which we ſent with the reſt of the Colours to <hi>Oxford,</hi> I ſhall make bold ſummarily to relate to you the carriage of this Buſineſſe, which deſerves to be acknowledged with as much thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to God as any thing that ever was done in this Kingdome. According to His Majeſties Command, we appeared before the <hi>Devices</hi> on <hi>Thurſday</hi> about three a Clocke in the Afternoone, with all our Horſe, which were not above 17. or 1800. at the moſt, being much leſſened in the long March, and many of them ſo tyred, that they were not able to come up; we ſhot off out Ordinance from an high Hill that overlookes the Town, to let them know, that we were there for their aſſiſtance; at the ſame time <hi>waller</hi> appeared with his whole Army upon an oppoſite Hill within leſſe then two Miles of U; he made a very great ſhow, divers of the Country People being called thither to that purpoſe. But really
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57087:3"/>
I beleeve his Horſe were farre more then ours in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and his Foot, beſide the Country People 2500. all of them as compleatly armed as ever Troopes were. It was reſolved that we ſhould immediately march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and my Lord <hi>Willmott</hi> very diſcreetly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it, That only his Brigade and mine ſhould charge, (which both together made not above 1200. Horſe,) and that the other Troopes (becauſe they had lately taken an affright, and had been put to the worſe by <hi>Wallers</hi> Men) ſhould only ſtand as a Reſerve, and not be imployed till it ſhould pleaſe God to renue their Courage with our Succeſſe: as we marcht towards the Rebells, they ſent down ſome Troopes towards Us, which were gallantly encountered by Serjeant Major <hi>Paul Smith</hi> (who led our Forlorne Hope, conſiſting of 300. commanded Men) and forced them to turne their Backs. Sir <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur Haſterigge</hi> ſeconded theſe with his Formidable Regiment of Lolſters, I meane his Curaffiers whom the Lieutenant Generall intermyned with his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade, and forced them to retreat, not ſo, but that they rallied themſelves again and charged the ſecond time, but with worſe ſucceſſe; for then my Brigade being drawn up to ſecond my Lord <hi>Willmott,</hi> they all ran away that could, and from that time Sir <hi>Arthur Haſterigge</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared no more in the Battle; upon this <hi>Waller</hi> drew his whole Army down the Hill, and advanced with his own Brigade of Horſe, with two Peeces of Cannon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, and two great Bodyes of Foot on the left Flank of it, theſe it fell to my ſhare to charge with my Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade, my Lord <hi>Willmott</hi> in the meane time rallying his men together to ſecond me if occaſion ſhould be. A<hi rend="sup">d</hi> I marched towards them up the Hill, their Cannon pl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

upon me at a very neere diſtance, but with very ſmall loſſe, killing but two in Colonell <hi>Sanayes</hi> Regiment; The Musketeers all this while playd upon our Flanke, and hurt and killed ſome; and another Regyment of their Horſe was watching an opportunity to charge us ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Reare or in the Flanke, but were hindered by Lord <hi>Craford.</hi> By this time we were come very near to <hi>Wallers</hi> Brigade, and the command I gave my men was, that not a Man ſhould diſcharge a Piſtoll till the Enemy had ſpent all his ſhot, which was pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually obſerved, ſo that firſt they gave us a Volly of their Carbins, then of their Piſtolls, and then we fell in with them, and gave them ours in their teeth, yet they would not quit their ground but ſtood puſhing for it a pretty ſpace, till it pleaſed God, (I thinke) to put new Spirit into our tyr'd Horſe as well as into our men, ſo that though it were up the Hill, and that a ſteepe one, we overbore them, and with that violence, that we forced them to fall fowle upon other Reſerves of Horſe that ſtood behind to ſecond them, and ſo ſwept their whole Body of Horſe out of the Field, and left their Foot naked, and purſued them neare three Miles over the Downes in <hi>Briſtoll</hi> way till they came to a precipice, where their Feare made them ſo valiant that they gallop't downe as if it had been plain ground, and many of them brake both their own and their Horſes necks. In my return from the chaſe, I tooke two peeces of their Cannon, and divers Waggons laden with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, and then rallied together our ſcattered Troopes, which were as much broken as the Enemy, by reaſon of their hot purſuit, in the meane time my Lord <hi>Willmott</hi> charg'd their Foot with the Horſe he had with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57087:4"/>
him, but could not breake them, and in the charge <hi>Dudley Smith</hi> was ſtaine, and Lieutenant Colonell <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> hurt and many others, but when they ſaw my Horſe rallyed together again before them, and the Lieutenant Generall continuing ſtill in the Reare of them, and that the <hi>Corniſh</hi> Foot began to ſally out of the Town, they thought it not fit to ſtay any longer, they began firſt gently to march off, their Officers marching before them, amongſt which (as I have been told ſince) Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> himſelfe was, and <hi>Popham;</hi> With that I advanc'd toward them with thoſe Troopes I had rallyed, and ſhot at them with the Cannon I had formerly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, their Officers thought it not fit to ſtay any longer, but ſuch as had Horſes rid away as faſt as they could, and too faſt for Us to overtake them, and the reſt blew up their Powder, and threw down their Arms and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke themſelves to their heeles, Our Horſe fell in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and kill'd 600. of them, and hurt many more, and tooke 800. Priſoners, and all their Colours, and this was the ſucceſſe of their great Conquererer.</p>
            <p>The Victory on our ſide as intire as poſſiblely can be imagined, their Horſe and Foot being totally routed, and all their Cannon being 7 Braſſe Peeces taken, and all their Ammunition. Sir, I beſeech you excuſe this ſcribling from one that is,</p>
