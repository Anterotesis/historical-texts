            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE UNIVERSAL <hi>Love of God</hi> TO Mankind, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I Find many Well-inclined Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple much stumbled about the Doctrine of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,</hi> as laid down by some, That <hi>God did, from Eternity before the World began, Ordain a small Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for Salvation; and Reprobate the most part of Mankind, and so pass them by, not giving them Saving Grace.</hi> If it be so, that the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35680:3"/>
be so fixed, that not one can be dimished nor added; then the Prophets nor Apostles, by all their Labour, did not, nor could not, add one to God; neither by Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can any now do it: But <hi>Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> there is, and <hi>Reprobation,</hi> but it stands in the two Seeds: The LORD hath Sown his pure Seed in the Hearts of all Men, and as they joyn to it, it will Regenerate hem, and so make them Injoyers and Hairs of Endless Life; but if Man joyn to the Reprobate Seed of the Serpent, then they bring Death over themselves. But some will say, I have chosen you; I say, the Lord said, <hi>I Sanctified thee from the Womb, and Ordained thee a Prophet to the Nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> I grant the Great God, in Dear Love, did Raise up some, but it will not therefore follow, that he over did cast away any, without
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35680:3"/>
affording them a Day of Mercy: For though the LORD may have Raised up some in all Ages, yet it was not only for their own Sakes, but to call to others, and to shew them the Mind of the LORD, that he did not desire the <hi>Death of a Sinner, but he had rather they should turn from their Sins and Live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, to let the World know, that he sent his Dear Son into the World, that all might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and be Saved from Sin by him; he tasted Death for every Man; And said the Apostle, <hi>It was the Will of God that all Men should be Saved, and come to the knowledge of the Truth;</hi> And it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so declared by <hi>Paul,</hi> we may conclude, that the LORD, who is the Fountain of Love and Mercy, did not decree the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35680:4"/>
Death of Mankind against his own Will.</p>
            <p>But some will say, He Died only for the World of Believers of the Elect? It is not proper to call the <hi>Elect</hi> the <hi>World;</hi> for Christ saith, <hi>If you were of the World, the World would Love you; but I have chosen you out of the World:</hi> Therefore 'tis not proper to call Believers, or the Elect, the World.</p>
            <p>Now seeing it is so clearly laid down in the Holy Scripture, <hi>That Christ <unclear>Died</unclear> for the Sins of the whole World, and not of Believers only;</hi> then we may conclude, that if Man believe in his pure Spirit, a Measure of it being given to every one to Profit withal, all that Dye not Saved, must not place their Destruction on the LORD, nor Blame him, but
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35680:4"/>
their own selves, for Rebellion against the Spirit of the LORD: And so I may say, as said the Prophet, <hi>Why will ye Dye? O Friends!</hi> Christ Died, he tasted Death for every Man, and gave himself a Ransom for all; and he hath done much for us thereby: But he hath sent his Holy Spirit into our Hearts, to Sanctifie, Wash and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie our Hearts; so that obeying the Spirit of Christ, you will have a Possession in the Kingdom of Glory, obtained for us by his Dear Son.</p>
            <p>Now, Reader, thy Teachers may tell thee, that if thou hast found thy Heart Pricked for Sin, and have been Sorrowful for Sin, and have felt the Incomes of Life to Warm thy Soul, then thou may'st conclude thy self in a Hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful State; I say so too. But where
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35680:5"/>
is that Man in the World, but the Lord, at one time or other, doth Prick to the Heart, and bring Sorrow over him; and when he is brought low, he sees there is Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for him, and so Comfort and Hope springs up in his Soul. Thus is Man Visited; by which he, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Death-<hi>Bed,</hi> clears the LORD; and upon these Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences thou art, it may be, Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Member of the Church; and so then say, all is well, Christ hath paid the Debt, and now the LORD looks upon thee in his Son: But pray, for thy poor Souls sake, Consider, <hi>If any Man be in Christ, the same is a New Creature, Old things are passed away, and all things are become New;</hi> a new Heart, a tender Heart, a Heart which Fears to Offend him, in every thing to love him with thy whole Heart, and thy
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35680:5"/>
Neighbour as thy self; a Heart, not only to part with <hi>Ishmael,</hi> but Offer up <hi>Isaac,</hi> if called for; and not to Love thy own Life for Christ and his Gospel Sake. Oh! If thou can'st say so, then Happy art thou, if thou continue to the end thou shalt be Saved. And this Love of God will spring so up in thy Soul, that thou wilt say with the Prophet, <hi>O come to the Waters of Life freely:</hi> And when the Spirit of the LORD fills thy Heart with Gospel-tidings, which shall be a Message of Joy to all People; then thou wilt say, <hi>The Arm of the Lord is not short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that cannot Save;</hi> but wilt cry, The Salvation of the LORD is come, and all Flesh shall, or may see the Salvation of the LORD, and thou wilt not be as one that Mocketh, when thou holdest forth his Salvation; but if
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35680:6"/>
all take thee at the Word, by Believing the Gospel Preached there is room enough in God's Mercy, for the whole Creation, Glory to the LORD in the Highest: But thou may'st yet say, Though all have some stirrings of GOD, they are so small and weak, that it cannot work that Holy Dread in them, not to Offend the Lord: Look into thy own Heart, and if thou find it so with thee, that it bring thee into a Holy Fear; so that, having a Hope of Glory, thou Purifie thy Heart by thy Hope, then the same Seed which is sown in thy Heart, is of one Nature in all, and will work the same in all, according to the Measure of the Gift of Christ. But thou mayst yet say, Jacob <hi>have I Loved, and</hi> Esau <hi>have I Hated:</hi> So it was not said in <hi>Genesis,</hi> but in <hi>Malachi</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:35680:6"/>
1. 2. <hi>But the Elder shall serve the Younger;</hi> which, if it had Related to their Eternal State, it would imply <hi>Esau</hi> is now in Heaven serving <hi>Jacob;</hi> but it was said to <hi>Jacob, Thy Brethren shall serve thee.</hi> But <hi>Isaac</hi> Blessed <hi>Esau</hi> also, though <hi>Jacob</hi> had the Dominion for a time: But the People of <hi>Edom</hi> were called in Christ, as well as the Seed of <hi>Israel,</hi> as it is written, <hi>In thee, and in thy Seed, shall all the Families of the Earth be Blessed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things I have wrote in the Love of Christ, that none may shut up the Kindness of Christ from Man.</p>
            <p>And now, my Dear Friends, whom the Lord hath called into his Blessed Work, let us go on still to Preach his Universal Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel freely, and set forth the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35680:7"/>
Glory of Christ in Love, in Life and sound Doctrine; then, if the People will not take Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we shall be Clear; and the LORD will be our Exceeding Great Reward.</p>
