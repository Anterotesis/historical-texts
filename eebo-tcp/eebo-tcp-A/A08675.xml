            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O omitte that which being besides our purpose, cannot bee expected of vs; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the antiquity of this towne, &amp; the siege of it by the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> 1588. both which may bee seene in our <hi>Dutch</hi> Stories: Wee will now come to the late siege of the Marquesse <hi>Spinola;</hi> and set nothing downe, but what we haue had from very good hands, or haue seene our selues.</p>
            <p>The Marquesse <hi>Spinola</hi> and <hi>Don Lewis de Valasco,</hi> hauing gotten <hi>Steenberghen</hi> by composition; the conquered Prouinces of the Netherlands reioyced mightily, by making of bone-fires vpon the rumor thereof; in such manner, as if the fish which they thought to catch, had had the hooke alreadie in his jawes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces not resting here, went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently thereupon the eighteenth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1622. to assault <hi>Berghen-vp-Zome,</hi> and fell instantly vpon the <hi>Horneworke,</hi> which lyeth neere to the <hi>Rayberg;</hi> but they were brauely repulsed by the Citizens, and those few souldiers which were left within the same.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1684:3"/>
The Prince hearing this newes, sent immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of his Campe neere the <hi>Rhyne,</hi> diuers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies into this Citie.</p>
            <p>The aforesaid eighteenth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> being holy Munday, the Enemie began (according to their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome) in stead of ringing the <hi>Mary-</hi>bell, to cry out ioyntly, <hi>Iesu Maria,</hi> three times together: but wee not vsed to such songs or tunes, wondred at it, and were partly afraid, not knowing what they meant by it.</p>
            <p>The same night, some of our Garrison went to take possession of a high ground, without the Gate towards <hi>Steenberghen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The nineteenth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> sixtie of our horse made a sally, intending to see wherefore they cryed out the last night behinde the <hi>Raybergh.</hi> The Enemie perceiuing them, thought to sound an Alarum with their Trumpets; but our horse without any long deliberation set vpon them, and tooke two Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petters, besides seuen or eight horse, and brought them into the Citie, none of the said sixtie horse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurt at all. By this happie attempt our courages increased: and when we espied off from our Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the aide comming vnto vs, and the Enemie then ceasing with his Ordnance: some of our Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison cried out aloud to them, That they had caried their Ordnance to the Lombard.</p>
            <p>The twentieth and one and twentieth arriued here, these three following Regiments, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Lord of <hi>Lockeren,</hi> of Colonell <hi>Hinderson,</hi> and of Colonell <hi>Fama;</hi> so that our Garrison amounted at that time to fiue thousand men. There came like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1684:3"/>
with them these Enginers, namely, Captaine <hi>Ralfe Dexter</hi> English-man, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dauid</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Tretorain,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Omkees,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Klair,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Byuordt,</hi> and another English-man.</p>
            <p>They went presently, hauing aduised with <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur Rhyhouen,</hi> Gouernour of the Citie, to fortifie the olde workes and raise new, which were necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for defence; the Rauelins and Lines being designed out, were in one night raised brest-high, and the next night perfected and brought to their full height, the most part of those workes being made without the <hi>Steenbergher</hi> gate, for without the gate towards <hi>Wowe,</hi> there was an Horne-worke begunne foure or fiue yeare since, and left vnfini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. In the meane time, our Ordnance mounted vpon the North sconse, to <hi>Boere Verdriet,</hi> and the <hi>Bosh-</hi>gate, was night and day discharged vpon our Enemies, which endammaged them exceedingly, as not discerning as yet where our bullets lighted: wherefore they made a defensiue worke of Bavins, about a quarter and a halfe of a league distant from the Citie, vpon the way towards <hi>Halteren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two and twentieth on a Friday, being the day of S. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> our Souldiers went with three thousand foote, and foure troopes of horse to wake the Enemies out of their sleepe. They mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching without the gate towards <hi>Wow,</hi> left the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Verwels</hi> on their left hand, and the <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergh</hi> on their right; and entred by the back-side into the Quarter of <hi>Don Lewis de Valasco,</hi> being there intrenched. Our horse hauing giuen a signe of the passage found, both the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:1684:4"/>
came on very furiously: and the Enemies being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready awakened, cried out <hi>Vienza, Vienza;</hi> and ours crying out, Quickly, quickly, kill, kill; set valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the Enemies, and slew many of them; and hauing spent their gunpowder, and perceiuing that a third thousand came not on to second them, they sounded a retreate with the Drumme (being deepely entred into the Enemies Quarter) and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their way behinde the hill to the Citie, they thanked their fellowes for the succour which they expected.</p>
            <p>We vnderstood afterwards, that sundrie Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with a Sergeant Maior, and two Captaines, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides fiue hundred of the Enemies souldiers, were slaine in the same skirmish: on our side Captaine <hi>Seaton</hi> was killed, and another Captaine hurt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides fiue and twentie souldiers slaine; but our men brought a Cornet with his men into the Citie.</p>
            <p>In the meanetime wee laboured very hard on three small redoubts, which in a right line lead to <hi>Kick-inde-Pot:</hi> the new Horne-worke without the gate towards <hi>Wow,</hi> was likewise taken in hand, and diuers other workes made higher and thicker.</p>
            <p>Without the gate towards <hi>Steenberghen,</hi> they laboured likewise very hard on the Horne-worke, and in the Quarters of the Lord of <hi>Lockeren</hi> and <hi>Mounsieur Fama,</hi> there was made also a Line of an hundred and sixtie rods, (euery rod containes thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene foot) because they conceiued the Enemie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to erect two batteries behinde the <hi>Roffelbergh,</hi> on this side of the <hi>Rysbergh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In those daies, the enemies considering that the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1684:4"/>
Garrison discharged their Ordnance vpon them, and sallied forth at their crying of <hi>Iesu Maria,</hi> they left the same. Whereupon our souldiers mocked them, saying that they had compelled the Enemies to forsake their redeemers: but I thinke they did it, because they were beaten vpon two of our <hi>Ladies</hi> daies before.</p>
            <p>The three and twentieth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> the Enemie began to play with his Ordnance, without the gate towards <hi>Steenberghen,</hi> vpon the hauen, he hit like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise sometimes the roofes of the houses within the city, the tops of the Ships, and the railes of a Bridge: spending that day three and twentie shot, without doing any great hurt. The same night the city wrought hard vpon all their workes; and principally on the North side, seeing the Spanish Campe erected diuers batteries vpon that side. This night our horse sallied forth both on the South and North side, and draue away his senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels and watches, causing also an alarum in his Campe: They tooke certaine horse, and prisoners, and brought them into the city, so that they were in some trading.</p>
            <p>In these daies there came to vs, many bauins, baskets, boards, beames, and other such like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision.</p>
            <p>The foure and twentieth there was brought to vs, good store of gunpowder, lead, matches, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nades, fire bals, and other munition: We shot the same day fiercely with our Muskets, seeing the Spanish forces began to approach. In the euening
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1684:5"/>
about ten a clocke the enemie discharged eight cannon shot againe, so that certaine women which were not vsed to the roaring of the Ordnance, grew very heauy and prepared themselues to die, but they were laught at. At the same time also, some few left the city for feare.</p>
            <p>From the fiue and twentieth vntill the eight and twentieth, there was done nothing of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but onely that our workes were fortified and strengthned daily; the trees without the citie were cut downe (the citizens lending their hatchets to the said purpose) and conueied thither. There sallied now and then a few at a time forth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with prisoners and horses.</p>
            <p>The enemie also hauing gotten more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, began on the North side to approach, cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and crinckling on like a snake. The fiue and twentieth, they threatned vs, that they would beat vs quite away, being <hi>S. Iames</hi> his day, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of that Saint: but we vnderstood by their owne souldiers, our prisoners, that the same day one of our Cannon shot, slue 100. of the enemies.</p>
            <p>The eight and twentieth and nine and twentieth, the Enemie beganne about foure a clocke in the morning, to play with his Ordnance vpon the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but he did little hurt, but we mighitly endam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged his new battery with our shot, and spoiled one of his peeces.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>August.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first of <hi>August</hi> 80. of our horse sallied forth,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1684:5"/>
behinde the high ground, taking their way, and leauing the trenches of the enemies; they not contenting themselues by giuing an Alarum vnto the Camp, slue likewise diuers, and brought sundrie prisoners and horse into the Citie; many being incited by their good successe, sued daily for leaue to sally forth, but they were delayed till better opportunitie.</p>
            <p>The second day our Ordnance shot cruelly vpon the <hi>Spanish</hi> Campe, thereupon about two a clocke in the night, our Garrison with fortie Musketiers sallied forth to make the Enemies to rise out of their sleepe, and slue aboue an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them. Whereupon there arose likewise an Alarum in their Campe, and our Garrison continued the skirmish with them, vntill the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoone the next day, at which time they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned victoriously to the Citie.</p>
            <p>The third, fourth, fift, and sixt, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done but working vpon the fortifications and shooting, and the old Maior of the Citie on the sixt day lost both his legs by a Cannon-shot, and died vpon it.</p>
            <p>The seuenth and eight day, there came di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of the Enemies souldiers running to our Citie, being very neere two hundred.</p>
            <p>The ninth day, some of our souldiers, both horse and foot, sallied forth behinde <hi>Burghuliet,</hi> and slue there diuers of the enemies, beside them which they hurt, returning home; and although
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1684:6"/>
they were not ouer-loaden with bootie, they yet gaue God thankes, for that they escaped with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the losse of any man, which happens but seldome.</p>
            <p>The tenth being vpon Saint <hi>Laurence</hi> day, there was an Alarum giuen in the North Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but it was not knowne at the same time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Citie: there came at the same instant a strong conuoy into the Enemies Campe, with all kinde of warlike prouision: this night they laboured hard on both sides at their fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Enemie gaue a token in the North, that hee would giue vs an assault; wherefore, we would not weaken any Quarter, to make it destitute of necessary defence, in case of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie.</p>
            <p>The tenth and eleuenth we sallied forth vpon the Enemie, and skirmished with him: the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Fryers</hi> Lieutenant behaued himselfe in the said skirmish as valiantly, as euer any soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier did in our time, and offered vp his soule with such a garland of Laurell for the Country: likewise <hi>Mounsieur de Preau,</hi> Cornet of <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur de Mee,</hi> jealous of his honour, went with him to the heauenly ioyes, leauing the rest in this vnhappie and miserable world.</p>
            <p>From the eleuenth vntill the fourteenth, the Enemie shewed himselfe very ciuill and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but in the meane time our Cannon did not cease.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:1684:6"/>
The fifteenth, there was made a halfe-moone neere vnto the corner of <hi>Beckaff.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The sixteenth came the Enemie in the night, about ten of the clocke, stealing vnto one of our Sentinels <hi>Perdu,</hi> hee discharging his Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, made an Alarum, and retired to the little halfe-moone, neere vnto the Horne-worke of of <hi>Beckaff,</hi> being closely followed by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; vpon his arriuall the Pitch was presently set ouer the fire, and they paid them home, as you shall heare.</p>
            <p>Captaine <hi>Cary,</hi> Captaine <hi>Ralfe Dexter,</hi> and all other Captaines vnder the command of the valiant Colonell <hi>Hinderson,</hi> ranged themselues presently in battell-array, to resist the <hi>Spanish</hi> forces with their valour: the Colonell afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, sent likewise some to the little halfe-moone before mentioned, to aide them within it. The Enemie being very furious, would not let passe twelue a clocke, for the day before was the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of our Lady, hoping, perhaps, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to haue the better successe.</p>
            <p>We being yet hardly in order, the Enemie came, without making any noise, close vnto vs, but as soone as he perceiued our bullets, hee cried loude out, with a generall crie <hi>fuera vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaco:</hi> The besieged cried likewise, Take the Roague, kill, kill, so that the skirmish grew very hotte: but the Enemies perceiuing that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1684:7"/>
they could doe no good with their furie, reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red quietly by the side of the halfe-moone; and afterwards set presently vpon the Garrison againe, crying as they did before; but they were likewise beaten backe: and although they assaulted the said halfe-moone eight times, and got twice vpon it, yet were they continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed; at euery assault the Enemie had fresh men; but the <hi>English</hi> and the <hi>Scots</hi> withstood them, without being once so much as relieued, a great while, vntill they called for aide, and were presently thereupon seconded by the Low-Country-men, whereupon they shot together so fiercely vpon the Enemies, that they gaue ouer the halfe-moone, after they had lost ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreths vpon the place; and intrenched themselues behinde the same worke. Whiles this fight lasted there were shot three thousand Cannon shot (namely, from the <hi>Bosh</hi> gate, the Horne-worke, and the Contrescarpe at the <hi>Wow-</hi>gate) amongst the Enemies, and did for the most part light vpon the Enemies, because their matches were seene.</p>
            <p>In the said fight was the valiant and generous Collonell <hi>Hinderson,</hi> shot with a musket in the vpper part of his thigh, standing at the same time vpon the Rampeir, being brauely at push of Pike with the enemie, and being fallen from the same, in his heauy armour, he was carried to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1684:7"/>
the <hi>Hage</hi> where he died, Captaine <hi>Carie</hi> and the Enginer Captaine <hi>Ralph Dexter,</hi> went likewise the same way (after they had valiantly fought) besides one hundred twenty fiue of our souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. This fight lasted from ten in the euening vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till fiue a clocke in the morning. The enemie lost in this fight one Count, fiue Captaines, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Lieutenants and Ensigne-bearers, besides eight hundred souldiers.</p>
            <p>The same day there was a cessation of armes for the space of an houre agreed of, to burie the dead on both sides: In the meane time, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie working very strong, contrary to the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we discharged our Ordnance vpon them, and slue many, and the Enemie doing the like, the dead were for certaine daies left vnburied.</p>
            <p>We perceiued about the same time, that the Enemie was verie sorie in regard of the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune happened vnto him, and would seeke meanes to reuenge himselfe.</p>
            <p>In those daies came certaine Switsers besides other souldiers into the citie; Likewise the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians which lay nere vnto the Quarter of the Lord of <hi>Lockeren,</hi> began to shoot diuers of our men with long Harquebuses through the heads, vsing this deuise: they tied greene grasse about their owne heads, that they might not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, when they looked ouer the Rampeirs to shoot, for they seemed only like some greene earth cast into the aire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:1684:8"/>
But afterwards we perceiuing their deuise, discharged our shot vpon the grasse aforesaid, striking downe the same many times, with the head, and whole body.</p>
            <p>The twentieth being Saint <hi>Laurence</hi> day, after the Vespers were sung, the enemie came againe about ten a clocke, at one side of the halfe moone, and would by force leape ouer the Ramparts; the Swissers which were lately arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued perceiuing the same, began to curse and sweare, daring them to come ouer, they in the meane time thrust fiercely at them with their pikes; but the Swissers slashed them againe brauely in peeces with their curtle-axes. This fight increasing, the whole quarter rose in armes, and discharged certaine thousands of Musket shot vpon the enemies, and flung granades like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and other fire workes amongst them, in such manner that the enemie lost againe aboue 500. men, and we had 20. slaine, and about 50. hurt.</p>
            <p>The one and twentieth came six Companies into the City; and the enemie shooting very cruelly, we answered them with the like; It was the same day resolued in the citie, to build a halfe moone vpon the hauen, betwixt the North Sconse and the citie.</p>
            <p>The two and twentieth, three and twentieth, and foure and twentieth, were two English En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes slaine with Musket shot, the one being
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1684:8"/>
hit by a Fryer, who was very skilfull in dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the long Harquebuse. The same day there went two troupes of horse hence towards <hi>Breda,</hi> 60. more got leaue to goe by land thither, and went in the night forth from the <hi>Bosh</hi> gate, riding behinde <hi>Burgvliet</hi> and arriued the next day at <hi>Breda,</hi> with 18. prisoners; almost all our workes without the city were perfected at the same time, but yet euery day we laboured hard vpon the trauerses or trauers lines and offcut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and such like.</p>
            <p>The six and twentieth and seuen and twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there came seuen companies into the Citie with Collonell <hi>Morgan,</hi> the Landgraue <hi>Philips</hi> of <hi>Hessen,</hi> and the Yonker <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> so that the Garrison was at the same time ten thousand strong; it seemed that at the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, the enemie would attempt something on the waters side; but we within prepared our selues to resist him.</p>
            <p>In those daies there rose an Alarum in the city, for that a Corporall with 10. or 12. soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, fell about noone vpon the approaching enemies, sallying forth out of the Quarter of the Lord of <hi>Lockeren;</hi> after they had slaine some few, they returned all safely backe, bringing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way diuers Muskets and shouels.</p>
            <p>Collonell <hi>Morgan</hi> in those daies with a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being Captaine of the Trunckes, surueyed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1684:9"/>
all the workes and mines: those Truncks were almost all made in two or three daies.</p>
            <p>The nine and twentieth the Enemie made a worke of bauins opposite vnto the <hi>Coninsbergh</hi> and the furthermost halfe moone, neere vnto the new horne-worke aboue the Crabbe sconse: Whereupon we shot fiercely and cast granades and fireworkes vpon the Enemies, killing aboue an hundred of them, and burning the greater part of their bauins, before our retreat. The Enemie being desirous to reuenge this spite, <hi>Don Inigo de Brosgado</hi> gaue an onset vpon a little halfe moone, lying at the quarter of <hi>Monsieur Famaes</hi> Quarter without the line: Our souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers beat them off sundry times very valiantly, with musket shot and granades; hereupon the Enemie caused his horse to driue them on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; so that with much adoe they intrenched themselues at last behinde the said little halfe moone: Our souldiers kept the Enemies backe, with granades and burning of straw, vntill their fellowes had pillaged the dead. The Enemies lost here 500. men, besides those which were hurt, <hi>Don Ioan de Portugals</hi> Corps (being slaine among the rest) was afterwards ransommed for 500. <hi>Gilders;</hi> which is 50. <hi>li. Sterling.</hi> On our side were killed the Lieutenant of the Lord of <hi>Lockeren,</hi> Captaine <hi>Hans Vande Bosh,</hi> besides twentie souldiers: Moreouer there were forty hurt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:1684:9"/>
The last of <hi>August,</hi> and the first of <hi>September,</hi> the Enemy would approach with rowling Trenches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Coninsbergh,</hi> but hee was beaten backe.</p>
            <p>The 2. of <hi>September</hi> there happened a Skirmish in the out-workes, and wee droue the Enemies with our Canon and Granades, out of some of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most workes, taking afterwards with vs the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which they left behind them, with other such commodities. The Enemy lost there many; on our side there were 20. slaine, and 12. or 14. hurt. The same Euening the Enemie made Boone-fires (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Victory which hee pretended that <hi>Don Cordua</hi> had gotten against <hi>Count Mansfield,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Brunswicke,</hi> passing through <hi>Brabant)</hi> and discharged his Ordnance: in the meane time the Spanish retreated a little from their worke on the Northside, and our Forces getting notice thereof, went presently thither and pulled it downe, carrying the boards and other materialls into their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison.</p>
            <p>The 3. wee had newes from <hi>Breda,</hi> of <hi>Count Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields</hi> arriuall there: in the euening was all our Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non as well within as without the City, discharged to welcome <hi>Count Mansfield;</hi> the Enemy answered vs with 8. or 10. Shot. The same night our Garison inuaded againe the Enemies Workes, on the North side, and pulled a great part of the same downe to the ground, and tooke almost all the Bavins away, without any resistance or opposition of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:1684:10"/>
The 4. the Enemy assaulted our halfe moone on the North-side foure times in one night; but our Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison driuing them backe, assaulted them afterwards in their owne Campe, and tooke aboundance of Pikes from the Enemies, and burnt great store of their Bavins, (brought thither to fortifie withall) we saw 30. of the Spanish Campe lying dead vpon the ground, besides others which lay here and there dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed; wee had two slaine, and three or foure hurt.</p>
            <p>The 5. and 6. there happened certaine strange Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, which are rehearsed at the latter end of this Booke.</p>
            <p>The 7. we blew vp one of our Mines on the North side, perceiuing that the Enemie had likewise one there, which also burst as well as ours; wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd our Worke presently againe, and lost nothing by it.</p>
            <p>Our Garison went the same euening betwixt ten and eleuen a clocke towards the Enemies Trenches, and made them to retire close to their Batteries. We tooke there aboundance of Bauins for the space of two howers together, and destroyed his Gabion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baskets, with sundry other workes.</p>
            <p>The 8. day in the afternoone, <hi>Don Cordua</hi> arriued in <hi>Spinola's</hi> Campe, being accompanied with 56. or 57. Companies, and certaine Ordnance to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Siedge. We heard this day that the E<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>my
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1684:10"/>
was raysing a Fort at <hi>Saint-Vliedt,</hi> a place lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Lillo</hi> and this City.</p>
            <p>The 9. wee burnt on the North side great store of the Enemies Bauins, which hee had brought thither to aduance his approaches.</p>
            <p>The 10. our Garison sallied forth againe on the North side, and tooke away all the Bagges of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies by day light, which they had prepared to fill vp our ditches withall, and to assault our Workes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, they are filled with stones, and so bigge, that a man hath much adoe to carry one of them.</p>
            <p>The eleuenth and 12. our Souldiers continued both in the North and South side of this City, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damage the Enemies by their sallies: the Workes which hee made in the night, we spoyled in the day, beating him out of his Trenches, with the death of many of his Souldiers, burning some of his Bauins, and taking away the rest euen in our owne quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>In the same dayes, and the eight next following, there came 20. 30. or 40. of the Enemies dayly run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto vs, for want of pay, as they told vs.</p>
            <p>The 13. and 14. the Enemy shot very furiously vpon the City, and did much hurt to diuers Houses and Steeples; but God be praised few persons were hurt: This night hee approached with a Line from the Wood, towards the great Horne-worke, lying
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1684:11"/>
South-west from the City; but wee stayed him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently with a Counter-line.</p>
            <p>The 14. our Soldiers beat the Enemies out of their Trench on the South-side, and slew all that they could meet withall, and finding there two Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of Beere, dranke them both quite vp, and so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing gotten some booty of Apparell and Armes, they returned backe againe into our workes.</p>
            <p>The 15 in the night, the English and Scots, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of Collonel <hi>Morgan,</hi> assaulted the Enemies quarters; and hauing driuen them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, they tarried there till morning, and eat vp all their prou<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t, and cast downe 50. Roddes of the Enemies Line, which hee had newly begunne; but the next night the enemies wrought on the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, resoluing to finish it fully. But it is a very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable thing to tel; an English Grey-hound which followed his Maister when hee sallyed forth, senting and snuffling about in the Enemies quarter, found there a Bagge of poysoned Bullets, (which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Law of Armes) and brought the same vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Maister. And I, getting some of them of the Sergeant Mayor of the English, sent them to my friends for a raritie. The same day about 100. of our Horse of <hi>Berghen,</hi> rode forth from <hi>Breda,</hi> and tooke seuen or eight Horse of the Enemies, neere <hi>Huys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berghen,</hi> about a League and a halfe from hence, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing South-east from this City: and afterwards they sent sundry Troopes close to the <hi>Raybergh,</hi> and brought 75. Horse into <hi>Breda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:1684:11"/>
The 16. the Enemy blew a Mine vp on the North d e, whereby two of ours were kild, and foure or fiue hurt: but wee set presently vpon the Enemies, and caused them to retire.</p>
            <p>The 17. there were sent hither backe againe from <hi>Breda,</hi> 60. of our Horse, which lay within this City before.</p>
            <p>The Enemy at this time threatned vs mightily; wherefore there was order giuen, that all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies should tarry for the space of eight daies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Citty; whereas they in former time returned vsually the fourth day into the Towne.</p>
            <p>About the same time wee got many Horses of the Enemies; but seeing wee wanted pasture for them, there were many times good Horses sold for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of 1. 2. 3. or 4. shilling sterling money; yea, the English bartered them away sometimes for a little Tobacco.</p>
            <p>The same day wee laboured on both sides, night and day without ceasing, and principally vnder and about the forsaken halfe moone, lying in the South part of the City, vpon the corner of the great horne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke, neere vnto the Wood; both wee and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies hauing vndermined the very same piece: but our Mine was eight foot deeper then theirs. About the euening wee blew vp a counterfeited or false Myne, which wee had made vpon purpose not farre from the other: the Enemy thereupon thinking, and vnderstanding likewise by the Runagates, that our Mine was blowne vp, without hauing taken any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1684:12"/>
they thought to make vse of theirs, and to draw our men thither by inticements: but the Foxe had inuited the Crane, as the Prouerbe saith. Collonel <hi>Morgan</hi> hauing sent a little before 200. Musquettiers into a Ditch, with charge to make an Alarum into the very Trenches and Workes of the Enemies; which by them was so brauely performed, that they droue the Enemies close to the <hi>Rayebergh,</hi> and into their owne Quarter, where they were strongly secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Then began our Musquettiers softly to retire, and forsooke the ground which they had gotten, only in policy, to leade the Enemies another manner of dance then the Spanish Pauin: They followed our men hard, and came in great numbers into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of the aforesaid forsaken halfe-moone, and further too, where they were saluted by our bright and well-oyled Musquets, and afterwards blowne vp into the ayre both by ours, and likewise by their own Mynes too, when they little suspected any such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as is aforesaid. They made a pittifull noyse and a lamentable cry, and our Garison setting vpon them, kild many (which were sunke into the sand by the blowing vp of the Mynes, some sunke therein vp to their middle, some vnto their brests, and some vnto their shoulders) knocking them downe with their pieces in such manner, that wee gat our purpose of them. Wee might likewise haue blowne vp the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies battery, neere vnto the aforesaid halfe-moone, and endamaged him mightily thereby, seeing wee had a Myne vnder the same, if our Commanders ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally had consented thereunto; the Enemies had
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1684:12"/>
11. Pieces planted vpon the said battery, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed vs mightily.</p>
            <p>The 18. they were labouring hard on both sides, at their Trenches, Mynes, Lines and Trauerses, and had some small Skirmishes with vs, wherein sundry were hurt; so that the linnen which some Patriots or wel-willers of the Countrey had sent thither, was well imployed in the dressing of the wounds: there were likewise made 1500. Cushions for the breast, and aboundance of head pillowes for the sicke or hurt Souldiers.</p>
            <p>The 19. wee perceiuing that the Enemies would blow vp one of their Mynes, (in the Quarter of the Collonel <hi>Fama,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Loqueren,</hi> neere vnto the forsaken halfe moone) wee went all out of our Myne, which was hard by the same) except a Frenchman and two other, which after the Enemy had blowne vp his Myne, were yet found aliue and drawne out: hereupon the Enemy came fiercely on, thinking that hee had paid vs home, with a purpose to settle himselfe vpon the forsaken halfe-moone; for a while wee resisted them, and they following vs afterwards at our Retreate, were blowne vp by our Myne; and buried aliue, this happened betwixt 11. &amp; 4. a Clocke in the afternoone.</p>
            <p>The 20. the Enemy began from all sides to shoot very fiercely vpon the City, endamaging mightily the Church and Steeple of the same, in such manner,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1684:13"/>
that the ordinary waiter nor no body else durst a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide therein: Wee supposed that the Enemy did this because <hi>Mounsieur de Greue,</hi> Gouernour of <hi>Isen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dycke,</hi> was burning and ransacking <hi>Flaunders</hi> with 2000. Souldiers and 200. Marriners. This same day <hi>Don Garcia Piementelli,</hi> a braue Souldier, was kild by one of our Mynes, so that <hi>Spinola</hi> was very sory for his death.</p>
            <p>The 21. wee blew two Mynes vp without the Bosh-gate, and saw the Enemies flying vp into the Ayre like Storkes. At <hi>Antwerpe</hi> they call now our City, <hi>Berghen bring on,</hi> in stead of <hi>Berghen vp Zoom,</hi> seeing there haue beene so many brought and sent thither from sundry places. But they dare no more assault vs so freely as they did in the beginning. We haue our hands dayly full of worke: but it is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for whereas wee lose one man, the Enemy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth tenne.</p>
            <p>We thought that they would haue broken vp the Siedge vpon our fasting or prayer day, seeing the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches were forsaken by them, about the Quarter of Collonel <hi>Fama,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Lockeren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is remarkable to consider, that of so many iron Bullets which both high and low are dayly shot into the City, but few hurt or kill any, there is such store of them that are daily sent to the Store-house with Wheele-barrowes, and the Children play with the Musquet bullets which fall vpon the streets, vsing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1684:13"/>
them in stead of earthen Bullets (with which the Children in the Low-countries are vsed to play: for Custome being another nature as it were, both Men, Women and Children haue beene so vsed to the thundering of the Shot, that it causeth no astonishment or alteration in them any longer-</p>
            <p>The same day wee sallied forth on the North Quarter, and hauing driuen the Enemies out of their Trenches, wee burnt their Bavins and Faggots, pulled downe their Lines, and slew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them.</p>
            <p>The 22. wee blew vp 3. Mines with good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse neere vnto the English Quarter, endama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging mightily both the Souldiers and Workes of the Enemies. But the fourth Myne which wee blew vp likewise thereabouts, towards the euennig, did exceeding great hurt, burying the Enemies aliue in the Mynes, wherevpon there rose an Alarum in their Quarter, and almost all night long sixe of our batteries, and three of the Enemies played with their Ordnance inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly.</p>
            <p>The 23. and 24. wee were busie about blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp of our Mynes round about the City, and to surprise our Enemies: wee made likewise Counter-workes against his Workes, or new ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,

in such manner, that wee saw the same day about all our Quarter, great store of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies slaine and swallowed vp by our Mynes: and it being very hot in those places, in regard of our Musquet shot, the Enemies durst not come to fetch them away; so that they became food for the Crowes and Wormes, and all this was effected with small losse of ours.</p>
            <p>The 25. 26. and 27. the Enemies blew their Mynes vp, first in the North-west, and afterwards two Mynes in the South-east of the City, but did no hurt to vs nor our Workes: it is true that an Englishman and a Swisser were swallowed vp by the Sands vnto their knees, but they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently drawne out by their feere; and against all expectation brought off aliue.</p>
            <p>The 28. the Enemy was drawing a Trench East, South-east, toward the way of <hi>Wowe:</hi> but curs blew vp a Myne about foure a Clocke in the afternoone, through the Command of the two Collonels <hi>Fama</hi> and <hi>Lockeren,</hi> lying North-west from the Citty, close to the sorsaken halfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moone, which tooke very good effect.</p>
            <p>There was order giuen before by the said Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels, that certaine Pioners should bee in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse with their Mattocks and Spades, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Souldiers with halfe-Pikes, to sally forth
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1684:14"/>
when the Myne should bee blowne vp, to leuell the ground euen and plaine againe, so that our Souldiers might passe ouer it and set vpon the Enemies.</p>
            <p>All this was very happily by the ayd of God performed, without any damage of ours, pulling besides a great deale of the Enemies Worke to the ground, and being afterwards seconded by 220. men, vnder the Command of Captaine <hi>William Van Fama,</hi> Brother of the Collonel, they filled vp the Enemies rowling Trenches, which are nery narrow but deepe, and killed there a hundred and fifty of the Enemies, with Rapiers, Courtleaxes, Mattocks, Hatchets, Spades, and such like tooles, taking also seuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene Prisoners which were brought afterwards into the City, as likewise the booties gotten, of mony, Ierkins, Cassocks, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I must not forget here to relate how that Youncker <hi>William of Nassau,</hi> base or naturall Sonne to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> was not onely a Spectator, but likewise an Actor in this Fray, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with a Sword in his hand amongst the thickest of them, and hauing afterwards gotten one of the Encmies halfe Pikes, did braue Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice with it, and was none of the first that came off, hee was onely hurt in the little finger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:1684:15"/>
The same night the English did likewise an admirable Exploit in their Quarter, Captaine <hi>Clerke</hi> being the inuenter of it. They digged a cóncauity vnder the Trenches of the Enemies, which lay vpon a high ground: The Spanish Souldiers perceiuing the noyse and rumbling vnder ground, ranne partly away (as being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to bee blowne vp) those which tarried, were afterwards when ours had broken through the ground, likewise driuen away, or slaine: This was such an inuention, as was yet neuer heard of before, by digging vnder the Enemies, to take from them their aduantages, and keepe them.</p>
            <p>Collonel <hi>Morgan</hi> likewise deceiued the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies very cunningly: hee commanded certaine Hattes to be set vpon stickes behind the Baskets in our new halfe-moone, to make the Enemies beleeue our Souldiers were lying there, and so it fell out indeed, for the Enemy supposing the very same, came and cast therein diuers Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, but few of them tooke fire kindly, although they could not haue done any great hurt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Hats and stickes: in the meane time our Souldiers came stealing and creeping vpon them, and made themselues maisters of the halfe-moone, before which they had shed so much blood in former time, getting now the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by a deuice without losse of blood: before 10. of the Clocke, all things were mended and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1684:15"/>
repayred in the same, and the Gabions placed the English shooting from betwixt them vpon the Enemie. At the same time the English got in the South-east 60. places of ground from the Enemies. And in the North-west Quarter, the Garison got likewise 50. paces from them.</p>
            <p>The 29. we assaulted againe the enemies row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or dry trenches, and slue some of them, so that they trebled their Watches to preuent more mischiefe. We blew vp a Mine in the afternoone, and after set vpon the Enemy, but lost 9. or 10. &amp; among them a French Ensigne. We slue a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Enemies, and a great number of sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and tooke diuers prisoners.</p>
            <p>The 30. day before sixe a clocke in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, there were threescore of the Enemies fledde vnto our Citie, being for the most part <hi>Italians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same day our Burgomaster receiued a Letter from <hi>Breda,</hi> sent by his brother, the Contents were this: That Count <hi>Henry of Nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw</hi> towards the euening would come with his Horse to <hi>Rossendale</hi> to logde there, and that the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> was following him, with sixe and twenty thousand Foote, and eyght thousand Horse, being all fully resolued to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture their liues and bloods, for the honour of God, the welfare of these Lands in generall, and our rescuing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:1684:16"/>
THe 1. of <hi>October,</hi> wee perceiued that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy had remoued almost all his Cannon, which were planted on the North side: wee thought hee would haue welcomed the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> therewith, but yet they were not so courteous.</p>
            <p>The same day there came diuers of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Souldiers running vnto vs, saying that all the Baggage and Ordnance was remoued, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept onely some fewe Field-Peeces, or Colve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.</p>
            <p>The same time, there arriued many Troopes of Horse in the South Quarter of the Enemies, little thinking to come to the remouing of the Siege. In the meane time they shot fiercely with their Musquets, and gaue vs certaine false Alarums; thinking to draw our Forces of both Quarters vpon their Mynes. But wee suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting that they would depart with a stinke or a smell, would not come to them, but saluted them with our Cannon and Musquet shot. They blew vp afterwards their Mynes which were ready, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they could not annoy vs any way with them.</p>
            <p>The 2. day there came an hundred and fiue and twenty of the Enemies to vs, telling vs, that <hi>Spinola</hi> was breaking vp. Wee in the meane time played with our Ordnance vpon them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1684:16"/>
noone they fired <hi>Spinolaes</hi> Quarter, and planted themselues in Battle-aray, as if they had beene afraid that wee would take the prize or booty from them: marching partly in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoone, and partly in the night following to their South Quarter, which likewise was almost all sired. They stood all night in order of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and sent the baggage away towards <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpe:</hi> the Foote followed the same, the Horse keeping in the meane time the Arriere-gard. But our Ordnance spared neyther Gun-powder no Lead, but gaue them their Farewell as well as they had before giuen them their well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. Our Souldiers visiting <hi>Spinolaes</hi> Campe in the meane time, found there Armes enough for fiue and twenty hundred men, and diuers Instruments, materials, and waggons, besides their vnburyed dead bodies, and great store of sicke and hurt men, complaining and lamenting against their owne Commanders. We brought them into the Citie for charities sake, and cured them as fitting.</p>
            <p>The Enemy departing hence with dishonor, had lost since the Siege 11000. men which were slaine, besides those which were runne away hither and thither, there being in this one Citie full two thousand of them.</p>
            <p>Wee haue lost in this Siege sixe hundred braue men, besides those which are wounded,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1684:17"/>
whereof there are a great number.</p>
            <p>God bee praysed for our Deliuery, and the Prince and the Souldiers commended for their good endeuours.</p>
            <p>There haue beene discharged since the first ariuall of the Enemy 200000 Cannon shot, both within and without the Citie.</p>

            <p>DEarely beloued Brother in the Lord, it is now long agoe, since I receiued any Letters from you: It is true that I vnderstood by a Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that you were well before the siege, hoping now the like. For asmuch as concerneth vs, we are in health, God be praised. Furthermore, we heare here daily of nothing else but heauy newes. First, in regard of the great store of wounded and hurt men, which are daily brought hither, with twenty, thirty, yea, sometime forty Waggons at a time, lamenting and complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning pittifully, they dye also many times desperately vpon the Waggons, cursing the houre of their birth. Secondly because wee heare daily such ill newes of <hi>Bergen vp Zome,</hi> for it is here reported, that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> forces are gotten into your Walles, and sweepe the streets cleere with their Ordnance, in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that none dare walke the same by day light: They say here likewise, that the Towne is vndermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto the Steeple of the Church too, that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies deferre onely the blowing vp; vntill such time as they shall be sure, that the Church is full of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; relating moreouer that no Shippes can any more goe forth, or come into your Hauen, so that the Citie is not able to hold out aboue eight or tenne
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1684:18"/>
dayes, adding thereunto, that the best Ordnance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Horse, and all what was of any value, was sent thence already, and that whatsoeuer is left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it, is like to fall into their hands very shortly; and here are many which lay great wagers vpon the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring vp of the said City: Therefore I pray you to send me word by word of mouth, or by writing (as you shall thinke it most conuenient) how all stands.</p>

               <head>The second Letter.</head>
               <p>COsen, I haue written to you in former times, that <hi>Holland</hi> was in great danger, and I hope that you perceiue now, that I informed you of the truth, and therefore will resolue to come ouer vnto vs, if you please, I shall send you a Pasport to preuent all suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of your absolute departure. For it will not be long ere <hi>Holland</hi> will fall into vtter confusion and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie. I doubt how you can escape in such a case, though you be a Catholique: for our <hi>Iesuites</hi> say, that the greatest part of the <hi>Hollandish</hi> Catholiques are poysoned by the potions of the Heretickes, making this comparison, that an Iron which hath once taken the ayre of the Load-stone, participates presently of the same nature; in such manner, that it cannot be taken away, or driuen out by fire.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I am afraid that you will speed no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Catholiques haue done, which were in <hi>Prague,</hi> or <hi>Heydelberg,</hi> or those sometimes did, when
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1684:18"/>
this City was sackt, where the Souldiers answered them which desired to be spared for their Romish religions sake, that there was no mercy to be found at their hands, but if they were Catholiques, it should be the better for their soules.</p>
               <p>Can you looke now for any thing else, then a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisal, and generall ouerthrow, seeing the Emperour and all Kings are on our side? You haue relyed and trusted vpon a bulrush, therefore I pray you to come speedily away, for our forces intend suddenly to make an end of the siege before <hi>Bergen.</hi> And haue therefore appointed a Clergie for the diuine seruice, and a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour to command in the Citie. Afterwards, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse <hi>Spinola</hi> is to set vpon <hi>Tertolen,</hi> and all the Islands of <hi>Sealand. Don Lewis de Valasco</hi> shall besiege <hi>Sluys, Don Gonsales de Cordua,</hi> shall with his forces, keepe the Campe of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in awe. Count <hi>Henry Vanden Bergh,</hi> with the Baron of <hi>Anholt,</hi> and the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarian</hi> forces shall inuade <hi>Friesland.</hi> Therefore I pray you come presently hither, and deliuer me from my feare; seeing that at euery Canon shot I am doubtfull of your life, suspecting you to be slaine therewith: Doe likewise your best endeauour to draw all other good Catholiques out of that cursed <hi>Sodome, Antwerpe</hi> the 13. of <hi>September, Anno</hi> 1622.</p>
