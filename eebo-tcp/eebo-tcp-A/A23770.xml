            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>: he is <hi>set,</hi> and preordain'd to be all this.</p>
            <p>First of the first effect, <hi>This Child is for the fall of many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I shall but only name that way whereby many men set this Child for their own fall, while they make his holy Time to be but a more solemne oportunity of sinning: We know many celebrate this great Festival with Surfets &amp; Excesses usual appendages of Feasting; Oaths and Curses the ingredients of Gaming; Dallyance and Lasciviousness the attendants of sporting, of all which this seems as it were the <hi>Anniversary,</hi> a set time for their return. Thus indeed the <hi>Israelites</hi> did solemnize the Birth of their <hi>Idol-Calf, They sate down to Eat and Drink, and rose up to</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 32. 6</note> 
               <hi>play.</hi> And must we celebrate <hi>this Child</hi> too like that <hi>Calf,</hi> because he was born among <hi>Brutes?</hi> And must his Votaries also be of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96831:3"/>
the <hi>Heard?</hi> And he live and be worship'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in a <hi>Stable?</hi> Because <hi>God</hi> became <hi>man,</hi> must <hi>men</hi> therefore become <hi>beasts?</hi> Is it fit to honour that Child with Iniquity and Loosness, that did come into the World upon designs of Holiness, to settle a most strict Religion? Nothing can be more incongruous then this; and certainly there is nothing of Gods Counsel in it. But to you whose time seems nothing else but a constant Festival, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hath the Leisure, and the Plenties, and the Sports of one, who as to these things keep a <hi>Christmas</hi> all their life, this season as it does not seem to challenge those things to it self peculiarly, so I shall not now insist on them; but proceed to those wayes by which <hi>Simeon</hi> did Prophecy, <hi>This Child would be for the fall of many in Israel.</hi> And they are three,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>This Child</hi> whom I but now declar'd <hi>God had prepar'd to be the Glory of his People</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 31, 32.</note> 
               <hi>Israel,</hi> yet his Birth was so inglorious, and his Life answerable to it, shall be so mean and poor, and his Death so full of shame and curse, that these shall prove a <hi>scandal</hi> to his people, who shall be <hi>offended</hi> at them,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96831:4"/>
and being prepossest with prejudices of a Pompous Royal <hi>Messiah,</hi> they will not believe in this, but reject a Saviour that comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those disadvantages, which will therefore prove occasions of falling to them.</p>
            <p>That it was so is expressly said, <hi>Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, a stone of stumbling,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 33. 1 Pet. 2. 6.</note> 
               <hi>and a rock of offence.</hi> And that it was so upon this account is clear, The great ones cry out of him, <hi>This fellow we know not whence he is:</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 9. 29.</note> They that seem'd to know whence did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid him with it, <hi>Is not this the Carpenter?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 6. 3.</note> And therefore with a deal of scorn they que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, <hi>Do any of the Rulers or the Pharisees believe</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 7. 48.</note> 
               <hi>in him?</hi> Yea, <hi>Christ</hi> himself knew this would be so great a scandal that in the 11 <hi>Chapter</hi> of St. <hi>Mathew,</hi> in the close of many Miracles which he wrought on purpose to demonstrate he was the <hi>Messiah</hi> he adds <hi>vers.</hi> 6. <hi>and Blessed is he that shall not be offended in me.</hi> As if he thought his mean condition would prove a greater argument against him then his mighty works were for him: and it were a vaster Prodigy to see the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the world, the promised <hi>Messiah,</hi> poor and abject, then to see one <hi>cure the Blind,</hi> and <hi>heal the Lame</hi> and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96831:4"/>
               <hi>raise the Dead;</hi> and they might think they had a stranger Miracle to confirm their unbelief, then any he would work to make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him.</p>
            <p>And really, that the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi> which the <hi>Prophets</hi> did express in terms as high as their own Extasies and Raptures, in transported words, as if it Vied with <hi>Gods</hi> Dominion, both for extent and for duration, should prove at last an Empire onely over <hi>twelve poor Fishermen</hi> and <hi>Publicans,</hi> and one of them a <hi>Traytor</hi> too: And that He that was born this <hi>King,</hi> should be born in a <hi>Stable,</hi> while he liv'd that he should not have an <hi>hole to put his Head in,</hi> nor his <hi>Corps</hi> in when he <hi>died,</hi> but his <hi>Grave</hi> too must be <hi>Charity,</hi> this would startle any that did wait for the <hi>Redemption of Israel</hi> in those glorious expresses which the Prophets tract it out in. To you indeed that are Votaries to <hi>this Child,</hi> are confirm'd Christians, these seeming dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages can give no prejudice: However mean and abject his condition were, that cannot make you to despise him, who from that must needs reflect how dear you were to God, when for your sakes meerly he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96831:5"/>
so mean and abject. <hi>He became poor,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, that you through his poverty might</hi>

Phil. 11. 7.</note> so <hi>emptied himself;</hi> thus he valued you; and men do not despise meerly <hi>because,</hi> and <hi>by those measures</hi> that, they are esteem'd, these are not there turns of love, its passionate, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging, ravishing effects do not use to be thus requited, this his great descent cannot occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion your fall, who know he descended only to assume you up to glory. But 'tis worth inquiry, why, since it was certaine, that for this, <hi>this Child</hi> should be <hi>the fall of Israel;</hi> that for this they would reject him, and the meanness of his condition would prove an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>removeable obstruction to their belief, as it is to this day; Why yet he would choose to be born in a condition so in the utmost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream to his own nature, so all contradiction to his Divinity, and so seemingly opposite to the very end of his coming.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jew</hi> indeed, will find no excuse for his infidelity from this condition: for what ever that were, yet those <hi>Miracles</hi> that made
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96831:5"/>
the <hi>Devils</hi> to <hi>confess</hi> him, brought conviction enough to make <hi>Jews inexcusable.</hi> And it was obvious to observe, that He who <hi>fed five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand with five loaves and two fishes,</hi> till they<note place="margin">Matth. 14. 19, 20, 21.</note> left more then was set before them, needed not to be in a condition of want or meanness, if it were not otherwise more needful he should not abound. <hi>God,</hi> that when <hi>He brought this first begotten Son into the world,</hi> said, <hi>Let all the Angels of God worship him,</hi> might<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 6.</note> have put him into an estate which all <hi>mankind</hi> most readily would have done <hi>Homage</hi> too: as easily have drest his <hi>Person</hi> with a <hi>blaze</hi> of <hi>Pompe</hi> and <hi>Splendor,</hi> as his <hi>Birth-day</hi> with a <hi>Starre,</hi> If there had not been necessity it should be otherwise. And such there was. For <hi>when the fulness</hi> both of <hi>time</hi> and <hi>iniquity was come,</hi> when Vice could grow no further, but did even cry for Reformation, and when the Doctrine that must come to give the rules of this Reformation, was not only to wage War with <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> with those desires which <hi>constitution</hi> gives, but which <hi>perpetual universal custome</hi> had confirm'd, and which their <hi>Gods</hi> also, as well as <hi>inclinations,</hi> did contribute to, which their <hi>Original sin,</hi>

and their <hi>Religion</hi> equally fomented; for <hi>Vice</hi> was then the <hi>Worship</hi> of the world, <hi>Sins</hi> had their <hi>Temples, Theft</hi> its <hi>Deity,</hi> and <hi>Drunkenness</hi> its <hi>God, Adultery</hi> had <hi>many,</hi> and to <hi>prostitute their bodies</hi> was most <hi>sacred,</hi> and their very <hi>Altar-fires</hi> did <hi>kindle</hi> these <hi>foul heats,</hi> whence <hi>Uncleanness</hi> is so often call'd <hi>Idolatry</hi> in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: And besides all this, all the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,</hi> and all the <hi>power</hi> of the world ingag'd in the belief and practise of this, and resolv'd with all their <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>force</hi> to keep it so. When it was thus, the Doctrine that must come to oppose, controul, reform, all this must come either arm'd with <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>sword,</hi> design to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle it selfe by <hi>conquest,</hi> or come in a way of <hi>meekness</hi> and of <hi>suffering:</hi> The first of these <hi>Religion</hi> cannot possibly design, because it cannot aime to settle that by <hi>violence,</hi> which cannot be <hi>forc'd,</hi> and where 'tis <hi>force,</hi> is not <hi>Religion.</hi> One may as well invade, and hope to get a <hi>conquest</hi> over <hi>thoughts,</hi> and put a <hi>mind</hi> in <hi>chains,</hi> and <hi>force</hi> a man to <hi>will against his will.</hi> All such motives are incompetent to demonstrate Doctrines, for how ever suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful their force proves, yet it cannot prove the Doctrines true; for by that Argument
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96831:6"/>
it proves that Religion that it <hi>settles</hi> true, it proves that it <hi>destroyes</hi> was true before, while it prevail'd and had the power. Had <hi>this Child</hi> come so, he had only given such a testimony to to the truth of <hi>Christianity,</hi> as <hi>Heathenisme</hi> had before, and <hi>Turcisme</hi> hath since: He might indeed, have drown'd the wicked world again in another deluge, of their own blood: but sure, never had reform'd it thus. Therefore, That Religion, that must oppose the Customs, and the Powers of the world, upon Principles of Reason and Religion, must do it by <hi>Innocence</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> by <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good,</hi> and (which was necessary, then by consequence, as the world stood,) by <hi>suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil:</hi> parting with all, not only the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, but necessaries of this life, and life its self too, where they stood in competition, and were inconsistent with mens duties, and their expectations: and by this means they must shew the world that their Religion did <hi>bring</hi>

many centuries of men, that entertain'd Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity with the contempt of the world, and life it self. They, knew to put themselves into <hi>Christs</hi> Service and Religion, was the same thing, as to set themselves aside for spoyle and rapine, dedicate themselves to poverty and scorn, to racks and tortures, and to Butchery it self. Yet they enter'd into it; did not onely renounce the pomps and vanities of the world in their Baptism, when they were new born to God; quench their affections to them, in those waters, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd them, even to the death; drown'd their affections to them, in their own heart blood: ran from the world into flames, and fled faster from the satisfactions and delights of earth, then those flames mounted to their Element and Sphere: In fine, they became <hi>Christians</hi> so, as if they had been <hi>Candidates of Death,</hi> and only made themselves <hi>Apprentises of Martyrdome.</hi> Now, if it were not possible, it should be otherwise then thus, as the world stood, then it was necessary that the <hi>Captaine</hi>

was not possible that He should be here in a state of Plenty, Splendor, and Magnificence, but of Poverty, and Meanness; giving an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to his followers, whose condition could not but be such. To give which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, was it seems, of more necessity, then by being born in Royal Purple, to prevent the <hi>fall of many in Israel,</hi> who for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition despis'd him.</p>
            <p>I am not so vain, as to hope to perswade any from this great Example here, to be in love with Poverty, and with a low conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by telling them, this Birth hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated meanness, that we must not scorn those things, in which our <hi>God</hi> did choose to be <hi>install'd,</hi> that <hi>humility</hi> is, it seems, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per dress for <hi>Divinity</hi> to shew it self in. But when we consider, if this Child had been born in a condition of Wealth and Greatness, the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> would have receiv'd him; whereas that he chose, prov'd an occasion of <hi>falling</hi> to them: Yet, that <hi>God</hi> should think it much more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, to give us an example of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Poverty below expression; then it was necessary that that whole Nation

            <p>But it were strange if upon this account, <hi>Christ</hi> should be for the fall of any of us; who have learnt a trick to reconcile his <hi>severe Doctrines,</hi> and our <hi>Sins</hi> together. Where Vice most abounds, though it be willful, and men persevere in it, they are so far from finding
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96831:13"/>
any reason to <hi>fall off from him,</hi> or from his <hi>Gospel</hi> for this, that they therefore take the <hi>faster hold of it,</hi> rely upon Him with the <hi>bolder, stronger confidence.</hi> As if good old <hi>Simeon</hi> were mistaken, when he thought, because men would not leave those sins which Christ so threatned, therefore they would leave him: because they could not beare those his hard sayings, to <hi>pull out</hi> the <hi>lust</hi> and the <hi>Eye too: cast away</hi> the <hi>treasures</hi> of <hi>unrighteousness,</hi> and the <hi>right hand</hi> that receives them also; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would cast off <hi>him,</hi> for, for this reason they betake themselves to him more eagerly, devolve and cast themselves upon him with assurance. 'Tis possible indeed that the new Christian'd <hi>Indians,</hi> might believe themselves oblig'd to lead their lives according to the vow that they had made in Baptisme, knew not how to live a contradiction to be <hi>Christian Pagans;</hi> therefore thought it absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, to renounce the one, and to reject Christ and his <hi>strict Religion was easier</hi> they thought. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> also might suppose, that when he brought <hi>light</hi> into the world, men would not receive that <hi>light,</hi> because their deeds were evil: But our modern wickednesses
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96831:13"/>
that are of the true Eagle kind, are educated, bred up to <hi>endure,</hi> and to <hi>defie</hi> the light: our deeds of night have learn'd to face both <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> yea and face the <hi>Sun of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and the <hi>light</hi> of those <hi>flames that are to receive them.</hi> Our <hi>Saviour</hi> told the <hi>Pharisees</hi> indeed, that <hi>that they repented not, that they might believe,</hi> for thinking it impossible they could <hi>assent</hi> to what he did <hi>affirm,</hi> except they would <hi>consent</hi> to what he did <hi>command,</hi> He therefore thought they were <hi>not able</hi> to <hi>believe,</hi> because they would not <hi>purpose to amend.</hi> But there is nothing difficult in this to us, who at the same time, are so perfectly resolv'd that every threat of Gospel is so <hi>divine truth,</hi> as that we assure our selves, that we could be content to <hi>die 'Martyrs</hi> to the truth of them, rather then renounce one tittle of them; yet even then are <hi>Martyrs</hi> to those <hi>lusts</hi> and <hi>passions</hi> which those threats belong to: Who, at once, believe this Book of God, that saies, <hi>except ye repent ye shall all perish;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 13. 3.</note> and believe also, that notwithstanding we do not repent, yet by <hi>Believing</hi> we shall <hi>scape,</hi> not perish, but be sav'd. And is not this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to believe our selves into <hi>damnation?</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:96831:14"/>
the <hi>third</hi> and the <hi>great fall,</hi> which <hi>this Child is set for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>This Child is for the fall of many,</hi> to wit, of all those, who on these, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grounds do <hi>not believe in,</hi> or do <hi>not obey him,</hi> who shall therefore <hi>fall into Eternal ruine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This our <hi>Saviour</hi> does affirm, St. <hi>John</hi> 3. 19. <hi>This is the condemnation that light came into the world,</hi> &amp;c. This does aggravate the guilt, and sentence. We were fal'n before indeed in <hi>Adam:</hi> and I dare not undertake to be so learned to say <hi>whether;</hi> to determine with some of them, that was but a fall from <hi>Paradise</hi> into the <hi>grave,</hi> and we were forfeit to <hi>death only:</hi> But I may adventure to affirm, that in the <hi>second Adam,</hi> sinners finally impenitent shall fall much farther then we did in the <hi>first Adam.</hi> Now their <hi>pit</hi> shall have <hi>no bottom,</hi> but <hi>this</hi>

               <hi>light that came to lighten them,</hi> shall be to them <hi>consuming fire, and everlasting burnings.</hi> And all reason in the world. For, upon that fall of ours in <hi>Adam,</hi> help was offer'd us: an easie way, not only to repair those ruines, but to better infinitely that estate which we were faln from; and a way that cost God dear

to purchase, cost him, not this <hi>Incarnation</hi> only, but the <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> of <hi>his Son,</hi> and diverse other blessed methods Salvation: Now if we <hi>refuse</hi> the mercy of all this, and <hi>scorn</hi> these miracles of condescending good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and <hi>defie</hi> those methods, that he makes use of, to raise us from our fall, it is apparent we <hi>provoke</hi> and <hi>choose deeper ruine;</hi> this refusal hath in it such desperate malignity, as to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son this great mercy of the <hi>Incarnataion,</hi> and all the rest.

            <p>A <hi>black decree</hi> this one would think.

that most men should <hi>rejoyce</hi> at that which is ordeined to be the <hi>great occasion of it to them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we have no reason to complaine: tis not unkind to <hi>deny Mercy</hi> to them that <hi>refuse</hi> the <hi>offers</hi> of it, that will not <hi>accept Salvation,</hi> when their <hi>God himself</hi> does come to bring it to them: tenders it upon <hi>condition</hi> of <hi>accepting</hi> and <hi>amending:</hi> which if they <hi>despise,</hi> and preferre <hi>Hell</hi> before <hi>Repentance,</hi> choose <hi>sin</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then <hi>Gods blessed retributions,</hi> 'tis but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to deny them what they <hi>will not have,</hi> and let them take their <hi>chosen ruine; will</hi> their judgement which they <hi>will themselves, set</hi> and <hi>ordeine</hi> Him to be <hi>that</hi> to them, which themselves do <hi>ordeine,</hi> and make him to be to themselves.

there are no footsteps of Him in the lives of the community of men: and I am certaine that you cannot shew me any <hi>Heathen</hi> age outgoing ours, either in <hi>loosenesses</hi> and <hi>foul effeminacies,</hi> or in <hi>sordidness</hi> and <hi>base inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi> or in <hi>frauds</hi> and <hi>falseness,</hi> or <hi>malignity, hypocrisie</hi> or <hi>treachery,</hi> or to name no more, even in the <hi>lowest,</hi> most <hi>ignoble, disingenious</hi> sorts of Vice.

to him, yet we never mind the doing that; and then which hath the better Plea? The <hi>Heathens</hi> sure were better, though he were <hi>not vertuous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if so, give me leave to tell you, how not only <hi>this Child,</hi> but <hi>this Resurrection</hi> too is for our <hi>fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the first <hi>Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> we shall find those <hi>Heathens,</hi> when they did neglect to follow the direction of that light within them, by which they were able to discover in some measure, <hi>the invisible things of God,</hi> when<note place="margin">Verse 20.</note> they did no longer <hi>care to retaine God in their knowledge;</hi> then they quickly left off to be<note place="margin">Verse 28.</note> men: and when they ceast to hearken to their reason, they soon fell into a <hi>reprobate sense.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> What was it else to change <hi>God</hi> into <hi>stocks</hi> and <hi>stones,</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> into most <hi>abominable wickedness?</hi> to make the Vilest creatures <hi>Deities,</hi> and the foulest actions <hi>Religion:</hi> to turne a <hi>disease</hi> into a <hi>God,</hi> and a <hi>sin</hi> into <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion:</hi> a stupidity, which nothing else but <hi>Gods</hi> desertion and reasons too, could have betray'd them to, and made them guilty of.</p>
            <p>And then, if by how much <hi>greater</hi> light and means we have resisted, we shall be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably

               <hi>more vile</hi> in the consequents of doing so, keep at equal rates of distance from those <hi>Heathens,</hi> that the aggravations of our guilt stand at from theirs, Whether, <hi>alas!</hi> are we like to fall?</p>
            <p>'Tis an amazing reflection, one would tremble to consider, how the <hi>Christian</hi> world does seem to hasten into that condition which St <hi>Paul</hi> does there decipher: You would think that Chapter were our <hi>Character:</hi> but that we have reason to expect we shall fall <hi>lower</hi> into much more <hi>vile affections</hi> then those Heathens did, as having fall'n down from a <hi>greater height</hi> then they.</p>
            <p>Consider whether men do not declare <hi>they like not to retain God in their thoughts,</hi> when they endeavour to <hi>dispute</hi> and to <hi>deride</hi> him too out of the <hi>World!</hi> 'Tis true, they have not set up any <hi>sins</hi> or <hi>monsters</hi> in their <hi>Temples</hi> yet, as they did: but if they can empty them of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> and their <hi>Religion,</hi> and make room, we may imagine easily <hi>whose</hi> Votaries they will be, that live as if they thought themselves <hi>unhappy</hi> that they had not liv'd in those <hi>good Pagan</hi> dayes, when they might have <hi>sin'd</hi> with <hi>devotion,</hi> been most <hi>wickedly</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:96831:21"/>
               <hi>Religious,</hi> and most <hi>God-like</hi> in <hi>unchastities</hi> and other <hi>vilanies;</hi> I dare say none of our <hi>fine Gentlemen,</hi> or our <hi>great Wits,</hi> would have been <hi>Atheists</hi> or <hi>irreligious</hi> then.</p>
            <p>Think whether those are not already in that <hi>reprobate sence</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> does speak of, who have cast off all <hi>discriminating notions,</hi> of <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil,</hi> who <hi>say in their hearts,</hi> &amp; <hi>affirm openly,</hi> there are none such in <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>nature:</hi> and if we should try by those effects, <hi>verse</hi> 29, 30, 31. or by that essential signature, 32. <hi>verse,</hi> they not only <hi>comit such things, but have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in them that do them;</hi> which because they cannot have from those commissions, when they do not commit them, therefore their debauch'd minds must be satisfied there is no evil in those doings, and must reap the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure only of such satisfactions: that is, have the <hi>satisfactions</hi> and <hi>pleasures</hi> onely of a <hi>repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate sense.</hi> In fine, (because I dare not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the character) Men sinck so fast, as if they were resolv'd to <hi>fall</hi> as far below <hi>huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> as <hi>this Child</hi> did below his <hi>Divinity.</hi>

            <p>O do not you thus <hi>break decrees, frustrate</hi> and <hi>overthrow</hi> the <hi>everlasting counsel</hi> of Gods will for good to you. He <hi>set, ordained</hi> this
