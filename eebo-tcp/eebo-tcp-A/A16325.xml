            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Here commend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee Christian
Reader a table of
Repentance, now put into a
little Tract, collected from
that graue, learned, and
godly Diuine, Mr. <hi>Robert
Bolton.</hi> I could haue
beene content to haue stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the publishing thereof,
<pb facs="tcp:25013:3"/>
vntill such time, in which
the Author might haue
beene preuailed with to
print it; for there cannot
but want much beauty and
lustre which it might haue
had, if it had beene set
forth or perused to be fitted
for the Presse by him that
first gaue life vnto it; but
being inforced to it by the
importunity of many well
affected, both farre and
neere; and I vnwilling to
haue such a pretious
fountaine sealed vp, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering

the good that might
redownd to many in the
meane time by it. I resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by the Authors leaue
no longer to ingrosse the
same to a priuate vse, but to
impart it to a publike good,
especially considering, first,
how few are acquainted
with the right nature of
Humiliation, no more than
<hi>Nicodemus</hi> was with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation:
that though
many boast of it, few haue
it, when alasse it's plaine,
without true Repentance<note place="margin">Luke 13. 3. 5.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:25013:4"/>
there is no saluation. Now
this table hauing so perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously
vnfolded the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of this grace: those
that haue a beginning of
it, may from hence adde an
increase to their store; and
they that want it, may here
see the way and meanes of
obtaining it. Secondly, the
extraordinary exercise of
fasting and prayer, a duty
of pretious account a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Gods Children,
which hath alwayes beene
wonderfully blest with a
<pb facs="tcp:25013:4"/>
happy successe, in so much
as albeit their ordinary
prayers returne not empty
without a blessing, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectiuely
to those prayers
which are ioyned with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
they seeme barren
and blasted, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
are fruitfull and full
eared. How then could I
withhold this which by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
and the iudgement
of iudicious Christians,
cannot but bee of speciall
vse and helpe vnto such a
blessed and successefull or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance?
<pb facs="tcp:25013:5"/>
Thirdly, these
times call for it, to fast and
pray and cry mightily vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God by our prayers, that
wee may stand in the gapp,
and make vp the breach:
and from this table wee
may receiue much helpe in
this particular. Wherefore
I hope I shall neede no
further perswasion for thy
gracious acceptance, than
that hereby if the fault bee
not thine owne, thou maiest
receiue much good and
comfort to thy soule:
<pb facs="tcp:25013:5"/>
which if thou findest, giue
God the glory, the Author
thy thankes, and me
thy prayers.</p>

then such troubles as

            <p>First, they are often <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

            <p>There must bee a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>

greiuing that hee is not

excellent in all these,
and herein make vp
what thou wantest in
the former. These bee
in some measure in all
Christians; some are
more eminent in one
part, some in another,
as <hi>Ioseph</hi> had little sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
but a strong Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
because hee
had so strong a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
