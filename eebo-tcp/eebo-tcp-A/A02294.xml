            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>ARIVS GEMINVS, a man verie glorious, and Conſul among the Romains, ſaide vnto Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar: O Caeſar and great Auguſtus, ſuch as dare preſume to ſpeake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, knowe not thy greatneſſe: and thoſe that are abaſhed to appeare in thy preſence, comprehend not thy nobleneſſe: wordes in deede right worthie of ſuch a perſon. Conformable to that which Varius Geminus ſaide, wee do ſaye: <hi>It appertaineth to the greatneſſe of Princes, that their perſons be much authoriſed, and on the other parte, that they endeuour to communicate with their common wealthes, for that with their mightineſſe they may giue terrour, and with their plaine mildneſſe remoue all feare.</hi> Sucro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius ſaith of Octauius the emperour, that euer any am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours came in his preſence, which at the firſt ſight were not touched with feare: and after in communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting did not adore him: becauſe, great was the maieſtie wherewith he did receiue them, and after, verie ſweete were the woordes wherewith he did diſpatch them. Of the great Cato Cenſorine, Plutarche ſaith: that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the man of moſte honeſtie, and greateſt grauitie that liued amongeſt the Romaines: he did neuer ſhewe to any man, a ſadde, but cheerefull countenance, or giue
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3692:6"/>
euill aunſwere, nor ſhut the doore againſt any perſon, either denyed any thing that was iuſt, neither ſhamed or diſgraced any man. <hi>Not onely happie, but alſo moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie is the Prince, that for rectitude of iuſtice is feared, and for his good condition beloued.</hi> Much weakeneſſe of Princes, and great Lordes is couered, and vices diſsimuled, when with their owne they be of good condition, and with ſtraungers of gratefull conuerſation. Of the famous tyrant Dionyſius the Siracuſan, Plutarche ſaith: that the immortal hatred which the Sicylians did beare him, was not ſo much for the tyrannies that he did execute, as for the incomporcable condition which he vſed: for that verie ſeldome he did permitt him ſelfe to be ſeene: and verie oft was heard laughing. The contrarie wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is read of king Antigonus, the father of the greate Demetrius: whoe was proude, couetous, ambitious, cruell, and effeminate: and with all theſe conditions the people of his kingdomes did both ſuffer and ſerue him: onely for that they founde the dores of his houſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes open, and in his mouth an amorous aunſwere. The ende of all this which we haue ſaide is, humblie to praye all princes, and giue warning vnto all ſuch as be about them, alwayes to perſuade and counſell them to be ſo humaine, that all may endure their conuerſation: and yet ſo graue, that none preſume to make ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of them: for that it maketh much to the matter of good gouernement, to be indued with good nature and diſpoſition. No leſſe inconuenience doth followe the common wealth, for the Prince to be holden in ſmall eſtimation, then to be vntractable, ouer haughtie, or ſtraunge: for, if he be inconuerſible, they abhorre him: and if not eſteemed, they diſobey him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:3692:6"/>Sardanapalus, the laſt King of the Aſsyrians, was with all men ſo humaine, that women made him ſpinne: and of Phalaris the tyrant, it is read, that he was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuerſible, that his owne daughters durſt not ſpeake vnto him. <hi>To the ende that Princes be not abhorred in their common wealthes, they haue to conſider, and alſo beware to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of extremities: which is to witt, in vſing too great familiaritie with ſome, and no leſſe ſtraungeneſſe with others: becauſe muche ſtraungeneſſe ingendreth hatred: and too much familiaritie leadeth to contempt.</hi> The rule that in this caſe wee dare giue vnto Princes, mightie and noble men, is: that they be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo affable with their priuate and fauoured ſeruants, whereby to giue them hardineſſe to craue any thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt: either ſo ſtraunge with them that be not priuate, as to giue them feare to demaund iuſtice. It is not remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from Princes, to giue their kingdomes vnto their children, to committ their ſecretes vnto ſuch as be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable, to vſe their liberalitie with their priuate and fauoured ſeruauntes, to take their paſtimes with their friendes, vpon ſuch condition, that their conuerſation be ſomewhat generall: for aſmuche as the liberalitie of Princes extendeth not to ſatiſfie euery ſuite: they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply much more with their amorous aunſwers that they giue, then with the rewardes which they beſtowe. Not vnworthily was it ordeined of the moſte auncient Greekes, that the vſe of Princes ſhoulde not be to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce in their letters patents, and commaundementes: <hi>I commaund this, I will this, I forbidde this:</hi> but that they ſhould ſaye: <hi>We commaund this, We will this, and ordeine this:</hi> for their better remembrance, that by ſpeaking in the name of all, they ſhould in time be conuerſant with all, be familiar with all, and diuide rewardes amongeſt all, and that they are of all, and not of them ſelues.</p>

            <p>¶The Authour proſecuteth his intent.</p>
            <p>It is alſo neceſſarie counſell vnto the prince, that he haue a ſound minde and diſpoſition, and his intents ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie well aduertiſed: for that if in his affaires he make no accompt to be certeine, he ſhall hardly ceaſe to erre: and if he be not attentiue to the affaires of the common wealth, he ſhall neuer vnderſtand them.</p>
            <p>The prince ought grauely to regarde the thing he doth, before it be done: for the errour of any other whatſoeuer, the offence is onely felt in his own houſe: but the errour of the prince, redoundeth to the whole common wealth. The princes that be wilfull in the thinges which they will: and headſtrong wherein they commaund: beſides that they go laden with thoughts, holding their perſons in perill, eſcandalize their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, accuſed to be ouer amarous of their owne proper iudgement, and moſte great enimies of others counſell. The prince alſo ought very particularly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the things of the common wealth, if he wil vſe good gouernement thereof. And this he hath to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed, not of ſuche as goe to murmur, but of ſuch as make iuſt report, and alſo giue counſel therein: for that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3692:7"/>
               <hi>twixt the Prince and the common wealth, there ſhall neuer be peace, if to lyars and murmurers he giue audience.</hi> Euen as Princes deſire not in their ſubiectes, but to be ſerued: euen ſo their ſubiects deſire not of their princes, but to be beloued, &amp; moſt truely, the one is annexed vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, and depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth each of other: for if in the Prince there be no loue, there is none that wil ſerue him with affection. Princes and great lordes, ought to holde in great eſtimation, that their ſubiectes do obey them: but much more haue the ſubiectes to make accompt, when their lordes do loue them: becauſe, without compariſon, his bountie is much greater that bindeth vs to loue, then the trauaile of him that offereth to ſerue.
<q>As loue is not repayed but with loue, ſo Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not to be ſatiſfied with only giuing ſuch as do ſerue and followe them, offices, caſtels, cuſtomes, houſes and money: but alſo they ought to ſhewe them loue in their palaces, and fauour in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires: becauſe, with their liberalitie, they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence their ſeruice paſt: but with their loue they bind them to ſerue in time to come.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Princes and men of power, ought in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to be amorous, in their ſpeach milde, in their behauiours muche ordered: for that generous hartes, and bluſſhing and ſhamefaſt faces, that followe courtes, and go in Princes houſes, do muche more feele the diſfauour whiche they ſhewe them, then the rewardes that they denye them. <hi>To the ende that Princes be deliuered of diſpleaſures: and their kingdomes better gouerned: it ſhalbe moste ſound counſell for them to be affable with all, to giue vnto all, to deale for all, &amp; to loue all: but if they determine to holde ſome more priuate, they ought much to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whome they admitt to their ſpeciall fauour: becauſe for one to be priuate in Court, it is not ſufficient that the king doe chooſe him: but that alſo he be of merite and deſeruing.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:3692:8"/>In giuing rewardes, princes may not alwayes eſcape errour, but in commending their heartes, they ought to be moſt certaine: for that, <hi>In this whole world there is not the like torment, as a man to haue his loue euill imployed.</hi> If Princes and great Lordes will particularly take into their fauour any of their ſeruaunts, they ought to be of particular deſeruing: bycauſe, loue ſhall neuer be fixed: when in him that is loued, there wanteth me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. Not without cauſe we ſayde, that it were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie in a Prince to be indued with a good mynd and diſpoſition, and with ſound meaning and intention: bicauſe if the Prince be taken with imperfect and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull affection, Alas of him, and alſo of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that by him is gouerned, It is euill that the Prince haue no rule in feeding, in play, in drinking, in ſpeaking, and alſo in ſpending: but it is much worſe if he vſe it not in his loue and affection: for it is a rule
infallible: <q>that euerie diſordinate loue, bringeth with it ſome notable vice. It is a loue diſordinate to bee carefull to gather riches, and not to haue a mynde to ſpend them: bicauſe vnto the greatneſſe of Princes it appertaineth, to ſeeke what to ſpend: and not to learne to keepe audit. It is a loue diſordinate, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince to folow the direction of his owne proper will: bicauſe it is impoſsible but he ſhould fayle to perfourme that which hee ought, that alwayes executeth his owne wilfull minde. Loue is diſordinate, when the Prince imployeth his loue in fewe, being Lord of many: by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Princes in ſuch wiſe ought to loue, and be boun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tifull vnto their priuate and fauoured ſeruaunts, that they diſgrace not the nobles of their kingdome. Loue is diſordinate, when Princes in vanities, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles do conſume their times: bycauſe the curious go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3692:8"/>
in ſuch wiſe diuideth time betwixt him and the common wealth: that he neither wanteth for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, or hath too much to imploy in vices. Loue is diſordinate, when the Prince is orgulous, quarellous, ambitious, and proude: for notwithſtanding, that as a Prince they ought all to ſerue him: it followeth not that as a God, they ſhoulde adore him. Loue is diſordinate, to hazarde the giuing and diuiding of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, not as euerie man deſerueth, but according to the wil of him that gouerneth: for there is no equal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie vnto the prince, as it is to chaſtice vice, &amp; not to remunerate ſeruice. Loue is diſordinate, when of will he taketh away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, that of right apperteineth not vnto him ſelf: bicauſe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatnes &amp; ſinceritie of princes, it is iuſt &amp; conuenient, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in their rewardes &amp; gifts, they ſhew their franke liberalitie: &amp; in receiuing, they ſtande with all men in iuſtice. The caſe ſtandeth thus: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Prince which is indued with theſe loues &amp; affections, may not eſcape many trauels, and alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſouden aſſaults and perils: for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euerie diſordinate affection, ſhe her ſelf, with her ſelf, bringeth griefe and diſpleaſure.</q>
Plutarche in his bookes of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth, perſuadeth the Emperour Traiane, that hee hath his will at libertie, and his loue ſubiect to no man: for that according as hee ſayeth: It little profiteth that a Prince be Lord of many kingdomes: if on the other part, he become bondman to many vices. The diuine Plato ſaide, that for a prince to be good, hee ought to giue his heart vnto the common wealth, his rewardes vnto ſuch as ſerue him, his deſires vnto the Gods, and his loue vnto his friendes, his ſecretes to his priuie counſell: and the time to affaires. Oh how happy were that prince, that according to this Platonicall

ſentence ſhould diuide and repart his perſon: bicauſe he being diuided for all: the whole ſhould be ioyned together, with, and for him.</p>
            <q>¶The authour applyeth all that which is ſayd, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end wherfore he did ſpeake the ſame.</q>
            <p>All that which we haue aboue ſayde by writing, (moſt ſouereigne Prince) wee will vtter and declare by example: for according to the ſaying of Eſchines the Philoſopher, Words well ſpoken, do awake and reuiue the iudgements: but great and manifeſt exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples perſuade the heart. For to leade or intice a man to be vertuous, and to do vertuous woorkes, it maketh muche to the matter, to perſuade with diſcrete rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, &amp; ſweete words: but in concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for much cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite which we giue to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he ſayth: much more is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to that which he doth. The Poet Homer ſaid:
<q>that it is, a thing verie eaſie to write acts of great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſſe, and verie difficil to performe them. For whiche cauſe it is neceſſarie, for ſuch as deale with princes, to ſhewe them by example, all which they perſuade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by writing: to the end they ſee moſt cleare, that the great and mightie deedes done by other Princes in the worldes: they want not force to performe them: but a minde to vndertake them. No Prince hath to holde of him ſelfe ſo ſmall eſtimation, that he doubt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that which another Prince hath done in time paſt: for after this manner, Theodoſius ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maide, by the remembraunce of Seuerus: Seuerus, of Marcus Aurelius: Marcus Aurelius, of Antoninus Pius: Antoninus Pius, of Traiane: Traiane, of good Titus: Titus, of Caeſar Auguſtus: Caeſar Auguſtus, of Iulius Caeſar: Iulius Caeſar, of Scipio: Scipio, of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Marcellus: Marcus Marcellus, of Quintus Fabius:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3692:9"/>
Quintus Fabius, of Alexander Magnus: and Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Magnus, of Achilles the Greeke.</q>
The heartes of theſe ſo high Princes, did not reade and inquire of the deeds of their forefathers, to feare them, but to imitate them: &amp; ſurely they had great reaſon: bicauſe <hi>None a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the mortal hath done any deed ſo glorious, that by another man may not be beautified and made better.</hi> Princes be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to do ſuch and ſo high deedes and enterpriſes, that of them ſelues be worthy praiſe, and very honourable for others to folow: for the ſame it is not more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, to haue a noble minde to giue the enterpriſe: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after wards to haue the aduenture, to finiſh the ſame. Plutarche ſaieth, that Ageſilaus the Greeke ſaid, that <hi>Fortune did neuer ſhew her ſelfe noble, but vnto a minde that was generous and noble:</hi> and ſurely he ſaid moſt truth, bicauſe <hi>men loſe many things, not bicauſe they may not attaine them, but for that, they dare not attempt them.</hi> The Prince ought to ſtraine and enforce him ſelf to be good, and to imitate the vertuous: ſince <hi>with leſſe coſt, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be vertuous the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vitious, milde then ouerthwart, valiant then cowards, patient the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> furious, and ſober then gluttons:</hi> for the theefe doth need as deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a minde to ſcale an houſe, as a noble minde is due to a captein that foloweth the wars. Dionyſius the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, Gorgius the tyrant, Bias the tyrant, Macrino the tyrant, &amp; Catiline the tyrant: if we might commend them, and they of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues giue reaſon: they would ſweare and affirme that they paſſed more trauell, and found the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues in more perill in defending their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies, then Scipio and Cato in conſeruing their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealthes. Oh, what great reaſon, and how much occaſion haue Princes to be good, and to fauour the good: ſince they haue authoritie to commaunde, and riches to giue: whereof if they haue skyll
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3692:10"/>
to take the aduauntage, with their potencie they frame them ſelues to be ſerued, and with their giftes they bring to paſſe to be loued. Ioyntly with this, I admoniſhe and alſo aduiſe Princes and great lordes, to be magnificent in their giftes, and verie attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue in their commaundements. For, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<q>a Prince may do what he liſt: it is not conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient he do what he may. Although the authoritie of the prince be free, abſolute, and without meaſure: to him it is conuenient in all thinges to vſe meaſure and moderation: for that euery gouernement that is abſolute, hath a taſte or reliſhe of tyrannie.</q>
Many Princes haue loſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues by their vices which they vſed: and many more haue beene caſt away by exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting their will and power: for princes in perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming all that they can, and all which they will: it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that their affection maketh them ſtumble: &amp; paſsion, their eyes to dazell. But (moſte ſouereigne Prince) ſpeaking more particularly, by the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Plutarche, and Suetonius Tranquillus, I thought good to tranſlate, compile, and to refourme the ſtorie of the liues of tenne Romaine princes, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie moſte ſurely to be knowen, and verie pleaſant to be read. The purpoſe wherefore (moſte mightie Prince) I haue taken ſo exceeding trauaile to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde this worke, is: vnto the ende my penne may aduertiſe, wherein my tongue with ſhame diſmaieth to ſpeake: for as Bias the philoſopher ſaide: The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of princes is ſo greate, that of more thinges they haue to giue them to vnderſtand, then to dare or preſume to ſpeake. The king Artaxerxes trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on a certeine daye, a man of the countrie preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him with a little water in the palme of his hand:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3692:10"/>
the which water, the king receiued and dranke: and when ſome did murmur of that deede, and alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract him: the king made aunſwere: <hi>It is no leſſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe vnto the Prince to receiue little, then to giue greate and bountifull rewardes.</hi> The philoſopher Lycurgus, that was lawe giuer vnto the Lacedaemonians, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded thoſe of his common wealthe, that they ſhoulde offer vnto their Gods fewe thinges in number, and not riche of value: whereof, when he was noted and alſo accuſed, made aunſwere: I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund not to offer vnto the Gods fewe thinges, for that I thinke them not to deſerue muche, but becauſe all men ſhould haue wherewith to offer: ſince of all men they will be ſerued: for in the time of Apollo, they ſaide vnto mee: that they had rather haue little of manie, then much of fewe. In the lawe whiche God gaue vnto the Hebrues, he was ſo limitted in the thinges he demaunded, and ſo humaine in that he commaunded: that in the order of the ſacrifices which they ſhould offer, he did ordeine and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund that the poore man whiche could not offer a goate, ſhould offer no more but of the hayre therof. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that Lycurgus offered vnto his Gods, iewels of ſmall price: and that king Artaxerxes receiued of a poore man an handfull of water: and that vnto the true and liuing God, they durſt offer no more but of the hayres of a Goate, giueth mee hardineſſe to preſent this work vnto your Maieſtie.

It wel appeareth that thou haſt made experience of our weake forces, and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not the greatneſſe of our mindes: ſince thou demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt the treaſure of our houſes, and the libertie of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The mynes that wee haue, be not of Golde to ſerue thee, but of yron, to breake thy pride. Doth it not ſeeme to thee, O emperour Auguſtus, that ſince you Romaines haue fought foure hundreth yeres in ſtraunge countries to be lordes, it were great reaſon for vs to fight in our owne hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to eſcape bondage?

                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Roſecuting our intent, it is to vnderſtand that in the dayes when warre was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely kindled betwixt <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> &amp; <hi>Pompeius,</hi> the <hi>Pompeians</hi> helde <hi>Yſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briga,</hi> which nowe is named <hi>Lebrixa:</hi> and the <hi>Caeſarians</hi> helde <hi>Gades,</hi> whiche nowe is named <hi>Calize:</hi> theſe two cities did ſerue to gather their baniſhed; to ſuccour their alies, and their wounded. Before the citie of <hi>Italica</hi> was deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Pompeians,</hi> there did floriſh two famous knights: the one was named <hi>Iulius Coceius,</hi> &amp; the other, <hi>Rufus Vlpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us:</hi> and theſe two knightes, were not onely Captaines at armes, but alſo were chiefe of thoſe two linages, that is to ſaye, of the <hi>Coceians</hi> and of the <hi>Vlpians.</hi> Before that cruell warres entred the citie of <hi>Italica,</hi> theſe two linages had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes betwixt them greate contention: but after warres began, they ioyned in great friendſhip: for that <hi>it hapneth many times, that hartes which may not ioyne by loue, do after conſent and agree by feare.</hi> The citie of <hi>Italica</hi> being deſtroyed, theſe two knightes came to liue at <hi>Gades,</hi> which nowe is named <hi>Calize:</hi> the one of them that was named <hi>Coceius,</hi> was graundfather to the Emperour <hi>Nerua:</hi> and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other which was named <hi>Rufus Vlpius,</hi> was great graund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father of the Emperour <hi>Traiane,</hi> and of the Emperour <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> by the mothers ſide. The Emperour <hi>Traiane</hi> was borne in the citie of <hi>Calize</hi> the xxi. of Maye, in the ſeconde yere of the Empire of <hi>Nero, Rufus</hi> and <hi>Catinus</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls. In thoſe times there was not in all <hi>Europe,</hi> ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, ſo generous, either yet ſo profitable a ſtudie, as that of the citie of <hi>Calize:</hi> becauſe from <hi>Africa</hi> they repayred to ſtudie: and from <hi>Graecia</hi> came to learne. And to the ende it ſhall not ſéeme a fable, let them reade <hi>Plutarche</hi> in the life of <hi>Traiane, Philon</hi> in the booke of Schooles, and <hi>Philoſtrato</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:3692:13"/>
in the life of <hi>Apollonius.</hi> In that citie of <hi>Calize,</hi> vntill the age of xv. <hi>Traiane</hi> ſtudied the Gréeke toung, the Latine, &amp; Rhetorike. <hi>Traiane</hi> was high of body, ſomwhat blacke of face, thinne of haire, thicke of beard, a crooked noſe, broade ſhoulders, large handes, and his eyes, in beholding, amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. <hi>Traiane</hi> entring the yeares of xvj. left his ſtudie, and did exerciſe armes: wherin he was no leſſe towarde then valiaunt. <hi>Traiane</hi> was of great ſwiftneſſe on foote, and of great readineſſe on horſbacke: in ſuch wiſe that it is ſayde of him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was neuer throwne, or had fal fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his horſe: or euer was ouerrun on foote. There chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced a certeine fleete of pyrates to arriue at <hi>Calize,</hi> the which being many, and taking the citizens at vnwares: the good yong man <hi>Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane,</hi> did ſhew him ſelfe that day ſo valiaunt in fight, and ſo venturous in conqueſt, that to him alone they did attribut the libertie of their countrie, and the glory of the victorie. Amongſt the <hi>Myrmidons,</hi> whiche be they of <hi>Merida,</hi> and amongſt the <hi>Ricinians,</hi> which be they of <hi>Truxillio,</hi> there was raiſed in thoſe dayes a certaine little warre for the paſtures of <hi>Gaudiano:</hi> for that the <hi>Myrmidons</hi> did ſay, they had held them time out of mind: they of <hi>Truxillio</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouched, that they had loſt them, and had receiued of them aſſiſtance to win them of the enimies. The <hi>Myrmidons</hi> did craue ſuccour of them of <hi>Calize,</hi> in reſpect of their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: the <hi>Gauditaines</hi> did accept the embaſſage of the <hi>Myrmidons,</hi> as concerning their ſuccour, and when they had choſen <hi>Traiane</hi> for capteine of their armie: he made anſwere:
<q>The deſtinies neuer permit, either the gods  commaund, that I take a ſword to ſhed the bloud of mine owne countrie: bicauſe if the one be our friends, truly the other be not our enimies. And ſaid more. Since the warre is not begun, and the cauſe of their debate may be diſcuſſed by iuſtice, it is my opinion, rather to ſende them embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to bring them friendes: then capteines to attempt wars. Conformable vnto all men, <hi>Traianes</hi> anſwere was both giuen and accepted: the which from thence forward, was holden &amp; eſtéemed for a knight of great valiantneſſe:

And hereof it procéeded in proceſſe of time, when <hi>Traiane,</hi> and <hi>Marius Fabritius,</hi> did contend for the Conſulſhip of <hi>Germanie: Fabritius</hi> taunted <hi>Traiane,</hi> to be a ſtraunger borne, and diſgraced in the feature of his body, vnto whom <hi>Traiane</hi> made anſwere: <hi>I confeſſe vnto thee Marius Fabritius, that thy good face was knowne in

               <p>IN thoſe dayes there was a certaine Conſul named <hi>Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua Coceius,</hi> baniſhed out of <hi>Rome</hi> by the Emperour <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian,</hi> a man in yeares very auncient, and in all that he eyther ſayde, or did, of great credite.

themſelues of neare kinred and affinitie: that is to ſay, of one countrie, which was <hi>Spaine,</hi> of one place, which was <hi>Italica,</hi> and that the one diſcended of the <hi>Coceians,</hi> and the other of the <hi>Vlpians,</hi> two famous and auncient linages: of whome we haue aboue made mention.

                  <hi>Rome</hi> vnto <hi>Campania</hi> to ſée theſe two knights, was the great Philoſopher <hi>Plutarche</hi>: who with <hi>Traiane,</hi> and <hi>Traiane</hi> with him, did plante ſo perfect and ſounde friendſhip, that onely death was able to giue ende to the ſame. And as <hi>Plutarche</hi> ſawe ſuche abilitie and will in <hi>Traiane</hi> to learne, &amp; ioyntly with this there was no wars wherein to be exerciſed, he was ſo drunken with learning, that he did abhorre armes: vppon which occaſion <hi>Nerua</hi> ſaide in ieſt: <hi>By my counſel thou ſhalt leaue bookes, and returne to armes, ſince thou haſte better handes to fight, then a tong to diſpute: for that it is not iuſt thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ceaſe to be ſingular amongeſt capteines, to be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent among Philoſophers.

And as on a day certaine <hi>Romaines</hi> practiſed by ſecrete deuice to kil the Emperour <hi>Domitian:</hi> and in great ſecrecie, gaue part therof vnto <hi>Traiane,</hi> did anſwere: I do well ſée that <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian</hi> deſerued not to be elected Emperour, &amp; much leſſe deſerueth to be ſuſtained in the ſame: yet neuer the more ſhal I conſent vnto his death: for that I will rather ſuffer a tyraunt, then recouer the renowne of a traitour. Many <hi>Romaines</hi> on a time murmuring of the inſolencies of the Emperour <hi>Domitian, Traiane</hi> ſayde vnto them: The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention wherwith <hi>Domitian</hi> hath intreated me, the Gods haue to iudge: for of his works which he hath done, I may not complaine, ſince he hath bene the occaſion <q>that I haue

The firſt thing that <hi>Traiane</hi> ſayd, promiſed, &amp; ſware in the Senate, was: <hi>that no man that was good and peaceable, by his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement or conſent, ſhould be put to death:</hi> which he obſerued, al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daies of his Empire. After this he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded <hi>Emilia</hi> to be ſent for, which was captaine of the Pretorian armies: whom he commaunded to be diſcharged of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and to be baniſhed the Empire: the one cauſe, for that he had diſobeyed the emperour <hi>Nerua:</hi> and the other cauſe, for that he had imbezeled the payes of the men of warre. He commaunded publike proclamation to be made, that all men that had iuſt cauſe to complaine of the Conſuls, of the Senatours, of the Iudges, or other officers of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they ſhoulde come foorth and declare: for that he wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed ſatiſfaction vnto the one, and correction vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Perſonally <hi>Traiane</hi> did viſite all offices of <hi>Rome:</hi> which is to vnderſtande, where they ſolde breade, where they weighed fleſh, where they meaſured wine, where the merchaunts dwelt, where ſtraungers did lodge, and ſo of al
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3692:18"/>
other offices: among which, he allowed all that was good, and gaue reformation vnto all that was euill. He forbad the vſe of ſhops or tauernes in <hi>Rome,</hi> that is to ſaye: that they ſhould not ſell bread, wine, and fleſhe dreſt in one houſe: affirming, that prepared vices, is the occaſion to make many vicious. <q>He commaunded all the neighbours
of <hi>Rome</hi> to be regiſtred: and there was found 285000 hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of married men, and 42000 young men to be married, 7000 prieſtes of the temples, 32000 common women, 12000 houſes <hi>de meſones,</hi> and 65000 ſtraunger factours.</q>
He forbad any poore man to goe from doore to doore, but that all which were impotent, ſhould be ſuccoured of the common treaſure: and vnto ſuch as could traueile, they gaue them whereon to worke from the Senate. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded all Iuglars and Ieſters to learne ſome occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to mainteine them ſelues in their owne houſes: and otherwiſe to be baniſhed <hi>Rome. Traiane</hi> commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded reformation in all eſtates, and cauſed examination to be taken of al ſtudents: and they were more without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon that were baniſhed for vnable and vicious, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained for learned and vertuous. For that in <hi>Rome</hi> there were people of many ſtraunge countries, ioyntly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſo many women, of which many did periſhe in child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed: and many children died for want of place to bréede them: For which purpoſe the good <hi>Traiane</hi> did cauſe to be buylt a famous houſe in the mount <hi>Celius,</hi> and indued the ſame very well with his owne patrimonie: where all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that woulde, were kepte and brought abedde by the ſpace of two monethes: and that all the children vntill the age of foure yeres were there brought vp and nouriſhed. <hi>Traiane</hi> conſented not, that in all the yere they ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue in <hi>Rome</hi> but xxii. holydayes: ſaying, that without compariſon, the Gods were more ſerued on ſuch dayes as the <hi>Romaines</hi> did traueile, then on ſuch dayes as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted: becauſe the vices were more which they did commit, then the ſacrifices which they did offer. <hi>Traiane</hi> did mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the ſacrifices that were offered vnto the Gods, that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3692:18"/>
is to ſay, neither to haue ſo many, nor yet ſo ſumptuous: ſaying, that <hi>the Gods would rather we ſhould amend our liues, then offer our goods.</hi>
                  <q>Vnto the prieſtes of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he commaunded to be giuen oyle, vnto the veſtall vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins wheate, vnto the olde horſemen cloth for garments, vnto the poore wood to burne, vnto Embaſſadours wine to drinke: for that all theſe things were not onely in <hi>Rome</hi> verie deare to be bought: but alſo not at all times to be had for money.</q>

               <head>CHAP. VII. ¶Of the noble and notable vertues that were in Traiane.</head>
               <p>THE yere that <hi>Traiane</hi> came to <hi>Rome</hi> to be Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, he was of xlii. yeres, in which age, he had in all thinges ſuch ſucceſſe, and did vſe ſuch moderation, that neither by his youth did hazarde the attempt of any fooliſh déed: either by ſlouthfulneſſe of old age, did leaue any thing euil prouided. <hi>Traiane</hi> was a Prince, in whoſe wordes &amp; workes enuie was neuer knowne: and as on a certeine time the Philoſopher <hi>Plutarche</hi> did commend him for the ſame, <hi>Traiane</hi> ſaide vnto him:
<q>
                     <hi>Plutarche,</hi> I giue thée to vnderſtand, that of pure pride, I am not enuious: for that alwayes I thought my ſelfe happie, to enterpriſe ſuche, ſo greate, and ſo notable déedes, that all men ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie mée for the thinges I ſhould take in hand: and my ſelfe to miſlike no man for any his noble attempts. <hi>Traiane</hi> was not malitious, either ſuſpicious, although by nature he were of ſharpe iudgement: which hapeneth in few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>commonly, men of ſharpe iudgement, be not alwayes of ſound condition.</hi>
                  </q>
And as great affaires natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally bring with them great thoughtes and diſpleaſures: although vnto <hi>Traiane</hi> they gaue ſome griefe, he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſéene of man to be angry, becauſe olde wiſedome had more Lordſhip in him, then ſoudeine yre. Althoughe <hi>Traiane</hi> hadde manye that did wiſhe him euill, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3692:19"/>
procure him euill: ſome for malice, ſome for enuie, and ſome bycauſe he did chaſtice them. He was neuer found that vtterly did ſéeke his deſtruction: but that in chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the quareller and vicious, they more commended him for his clemencie, then complained or murmured for their griefe and puniſhment Although <hi>Traiane</hi> were not much learned, he was moſte truely a greate friende vnto learned men: whome he did promote vnto honours and to eſtates, and did much ioy to holde them for his friendes: in ſuche wiſe, that in his houſe and court, a learned man was neuer ſéene in neceſſitie. <hi>Traiane</hi> did much deſire to vnderſtande the ambitions of <hi>Rome,</hi> and diſorders of his houſe: but ioyntly therewith he woulde not be aduertiſed by the manner of murmuring, but rather by the way of aduice. <hi>Traiane</hi> was a great enimie of liers, &amp; no leſſe of de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tractours: for which cauſe they ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many times he ſayd: <hi>It is more ſafe vnto princes, to haue patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to heare their own errours, then to giue eare vnto ſuch as reporte other mens defections:</hi> and ſayde more. That <hi>of neceſsitie the Prince muſt haue bloudie hands, that giueth eare to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers. Traiane</hi> wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> general vice which vſually reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in all men, which is couetouſneſſe, wherof he was not either accuſed or noted: but rather of great bountie &amp; lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, he was of all nations well liked &amp; commended, bicauſe they were infinite that did praiſe him, for that which they had receiued, and no man did complaine for that which he had taken. <hi>Traiane</hi> naturally did delight in warres, and after they were begunne, verie diligent in proſecuting, and moſt conſtant in finiſhing the ſame. Albeit he was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to warres, yet therfore he ceaſed not to procure by al mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to conſerue peace: for as he ſaid, <hi>The Gods neuer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that any ſhould be ouercome in the wars, but ſuch as be enimies vnto peace. Traiane</hi> was verie moderate in the ordinarie expe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of his houſe: &amp; ioyntly with this, moſt liberall in cauſes of war: and moſt certainly in the ſame he ſhewed him ſelf to be a prince ſkilful, prouident &amp; wiſe: for as <hi>Plato</hi> ſayde, <hi>If the expences of the common wealth

               <p>
                  <hi>TRaiane</hi> made in <hi>Rome</hi> many &amp; very notable buyldings: it is to vnderſtande, a great and ſumptuous market place, and all the things that were in the compaſſe thereof. He made a paued calſey, being a broad high waye that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted two leagues and halfe, whereon they might come &amp; go in Summer without duſt, and in Winter without mire. He made a temple vnto the God <hi>Apollo,</hi> another vnto the god <hi>Mars,</hi> another vnto the god <hi>Iupiter,</hi> another vnto the god <hi>Eſculapius,</hi> another vnto the goddeſſe <hi>Ceres,</hi> another vnto the goddeſſe <hi>Bellona,</hi> another vnto the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Berecyntha,</hi> whome the <hi>Romaines</hi> named the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all the Gods. He repaired the decayed walles, he made tenne paire of milles vppon barkes on the riuer of <hi>Tyber,</hi> in which he commaunded that the prieſtes, the veſtall virgins, and the olde knightes ſhoulde firſt grinde and be ſerued. He did repaire and inlarge the colledge, and placed gates, porters, and watchemen, and many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfetes and pictures of golde and ſiluer: and did vſe for cuſtome as oft as he came thither, to be the firſt that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and the laſt that went foorth. He buylt in all ſtréetes in <hi>Rome</hi> publique purging places, and commanded vpon great &amp; grieuous penalties, that no man ſhould be ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to defile the ſtreates, or other open places: in ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that all the dayes of <hi>Traiane, Rome</hi> did not ſéeme, but as a hall cleane ſwept. In the fourth region ioyning vnto the temple of <hi>Serapis, Traiane</hi> did buyld moſt ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous baynes, much larger then thoſe which <hi>Titus</hi> made, and much richer then thoſe which <hi>Tyberius</hi> buylt. Alſo <hi>Traiane</hi> buylt an hundred houſes large and ſtrong, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3692:20"/>
to kill and ſell their béefe and mutton. In the gardeines of <hi>Vulcane, Traiane</hi> did buyld an houſe of pleaſure, and made therein a certein fiſhepoole for delight: but it is not found or recorded, that he did either eate or ſléepe in the ſame. Neare vnto the houſes of the <hi>Fabians,</hi> he brought from farre a founteine, in the compaſſe whereof he erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a ſtately houſe, naming it <hi>the place of Datia, Traiane</hi> naturally, was a friend not onely of buylding, but alſo to beholde buyldinges and worke men: whiche is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinly knowen, in that he made a lawe: <hi>that all ſuch men as ſhould raiſe any newe buyldinges in Rome, the thirde parte of the charges ſhoulde be paide from the common treaſure.</hi> It was a marueilous matter, that in all theſe &amp; many other buyldings which <hi>Traiane</hi> made in <hi>Rome,</hi> he vſed no other mennes money, he conſtrained no man to trauaile by force, he deferred no man of payement, for he ſaide and helde opinion, that <hi>it were more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and alſo more ſure vnto Princes, to dwell in poore lodginges: then of other mennes ſweat to make riche houſes.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>TRaiane</hi> wanted not ſome humaine infirmities, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in men at times do fall: for, if with reaſon he were prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for many thinges: not without occaſion <q>in ſome cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
he was iuſtly diſcommended. Vntill this daye there hath béene no Prince in whome all vertues did concurre, either in whome all vices were founde: bycauſe, there is no man ſuch an outcaſt, in whome there is not to be found ſomewhat to be praiſed: either any man of life ſo refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that in him there is not ſomewhat to be amended.</q>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:3692:20"/>
                  <hi>Traiane</hi> naturally was proude and ambitious of honour: and after a manner he did delight, that in open place they ſhould erecte vnto him pictures and counterfetes of golde, and that his fame might be ſpreade throughout the world. In all his erected buyldinges he placed the titles of his triumphes, and perſuaded the Oratours to compounde many méetres to his praiſe, whiche he made to be grauen in ſtone in the hyeſt front of his buyldinges. In the vice of the fleſhe, <hi>Traiane</hi> was not a little fleſhly: and yet in this caſe it is moſte true, that he neuer vſed force to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: but ioyntly therewith, being moſte diligent in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, and verie liberall in giuing: he fixed his amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous affection vppon no perſon, that he inioyed not. In his garmentes, and in the manner of the faſhion and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereof, <hi>Traiane</hi> was moſt curious and coſtly: by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was no daye, that either of Golde, ſiluer, or ſilke, he did not on his perſon vſe ſome chaunge.</p>
               <p>As we haue ſaide, <hi>Traiane</hi> was a Prince both wiſe, and of ſharpe and readie iudgement: but ioyntly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, muche affectionate vnto his owne opinion: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of cares many times did followe and perſecute him: by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, <hi>there is not, hath beene, or ſhalbe Prince in this worlde, ſo wiſe, that neceſsitie conſtraineth not, at times, to chaunge counſell.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Traiane</hi> was a verie friende vnto wiſe men, but he him ſelfe was not muche learned: whereof béeing repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by his friende and Philoſopher <hi>Plutarche: Traiane</hi> ſaide vnto him: <hi>the Gods haue not created mee to turne ouer bookes, but to deale with armour.</hi> When <hi>Traiane</hi> had vacant time from warres, he did muche delight to take his pleaſure in vaine thinges, wherein he conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med many nightes and dayes, and of this vice he was not a little noted, and alſo accuſed: and doubtleſſe not without great cauſe: for that <hi>Princes which preſume to bee good Princes, in ſuche wiſe ought to take their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime, that they ſeeme not to loſe their time.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that <hi>Traiane</hi> deliuered <hi>Rome</hi> of manye vices,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3692:21"/>
and baniſhed from thence many that were vicious: he was noted and alſo blamed, that he defended and ſuſteined the ſwoorde players, who were men ydle and ſeditious, and this he did, becauſe in his youth they had béene his frends, and delighted in them: wherin he had leſte reaſon, for that <hi>It is not iuſt, that Princes take ſuche recreation for their perſons, as tendeth to the preiudice of the comon wealth. Traiane</hi> was verie moderate in féeding, but ioyntly ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, not ouer ſober in drinking: for that to obteine good wine, he was ſomewhat curious and carefull, and in the drinking thereof, not verie temperate. Notwithſtanding, that ſometimes he dranke ſomewhat more then was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for the health of his bodie, and to the authoritie of his perſon: yet, at that time, neuer man ſawe him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt or procure any vile déede.</p>

               <p>IN the xliiij. yere of his age, and in the ſecond of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, <hi>Traiane</hi> receiued newes, that <hi>Decebal</hi> king of <hi>Datia,</hi> which in theſe dayes is named <hi>Denmarke,</hi> rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt the <hi>Romaine</hi> Empire: the which newes gaue no ſmall ſkandal and offence vnto the Senate: for that on the one part naturally they were a nation very war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: and on the other parte, for that king <hi>Decebal</hi> was a prince of great vnquietneſſe, and alſo of a minde deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. For that the Emperour <hi>Domitian</hi> was a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter friend vnto vices, then an enimie vnto enimies: in all his reigne, king <hi>Decebal</hi> did neuer yeald obedience vnto the <hi>Romaine</hi> Empire: whereby the <hi>Datians</hi> had recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red great boldneſſe, and the <hi>Romaines</hi> loſt their credite.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Traiane,</hi> in his owne perſon determined to go in thoſe warres: for which purpoſe he made choice of a verie ſmall armie, and yet of much ſtrength: for he helde opinion,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3692:21"/>
that, <hi>as no other meates ſhould be brought vnto the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then are to be eaten: ſo they ought not to leade vnto the warres, but ſuch as muſt fight:</hi> and ſaide further: <hi>by experience I haue proued, as well in eating, as in figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that many meates at table be lotheſome: and in the warres many men be troubleſome.</hi> King <hi>Decebal</hi> béeing aduertiſed, that <hi>Traiane</hi> remoued from <hi>Rome</hi> to make conqueſt of him and his countrie, determined to marche and encounter with him vppon the waye: and as he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſo he perfourmed: for he helde the <hi>Romaines</hi> in ſo ſmall eſtimation, that he counted it ſhame to be béeſéeged of them. And when the armies were in ſight one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> being ſo manye, &amp; the <hi>Romaines</hi> ſo fewe: they did not a litle perſuade <hi>Traiane,</hi> to take peace, or to make ſome honeſt truce, and without peril to return to <hi>Rome. Traiane</hi> to this made aunſwer: our weakeneſſe ſhould be great, and with great reaſon they would blame vs in <hi>Rome,</hi> if ſo ſoude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly we ſhould ceaſſe to make warre, without firſt making proofe, to what ende their forces do extende, and alſo vnderſtande what our deſtinies do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: bycauſe it may be, that if their power be great, our fortune may be much greater.
<q>King <hi>Decebal</hi> had taken &amp; fortified all the daungerous paſſages, and broken all brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, barkes, &amp; botes of all the riuers, and had taken &amp; ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all the victuals where the <hi>Romaines</hi> ſhould paſſe: and all theſe thinges were occaſions to increaſe trauaile vnto <hi>Traiane,</hi> but not of power ſufficient to remoue his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe: for that <hi>Traiane</hi> was of ſo valliant a minde, that where he ſawe fortune moſt doubtfull, from thence he did hope of victorie moſte certeine. <hi>Traiane</hi> did take &amp; poſſeſſe the height of the rockes and mountaines, and thereon with all his armie did trauaile many nights and dayes: &amp; king <hi>Decebal</hi> did neuer conceiue that <hi>Traiane</hi> would tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile by thoſe thornie mountaines: for that he thought it impoſſible for men to trauaile where beaſtes could not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape. King <hi>Decebal</hi> was conſtrained to returne vnto the plaine countrie, and to fortifie him ſelfe in ſtrong cities, &amp;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3692:22"/>
to this ende <hi>Traiane</hi> did purpoſe not to fight in mountains that be daungerous, but in fieldes that be plaine: for he ſaide, that they came not to fight with the mountaines, whiche bred bruite beaſtes: but to tame cities which ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteine ſeditious men.</q>
In very ſhort ſpace <hi>Traiane</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken fiue cities, ſeuen caſtels, and many priſoners: among which <hi>Mirto</hi> was taken, being vnckle, tutour, and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of king <hi>Decebal</hi>: a man of greate grauitie and of no leſſe authoritie. <hi>Traiane</hi> was ſo rigorous with them that did reſiſt him and ſo pitifull vnto ſuch as did yelde them, that ſome for loue, and others for feare, began ſecretely to practiſe throughout the kingdome, totally to yeald them ſelues vnto <hi>Traiane</hi>: becauſe they ſawe euery day <hi>Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> force to increaſe, and the power of king <hi>Decebal</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay and growe very weake. <hi>Traiane</hi> beſieging a certeine citie named <hi>Myrtha,</hi> holding the captaine therof in great diſtreſſe, king <hi>Decebal</hi> forgate not to ſende him reliefe &amp; ſuccour of great power: againſt whome <hi>Lucius Metellus,</hi> a captaine of <hi>Traianes</hi> did march and aduaunce him ſelf: who at that inſtant fought ſo valiantly and manlike, that he leſt not of all the enimies one onely perſon, that was
not either taken or ſlaine. <q>And as in that battaile manye <hi>Romaines</hi> were ſlaine, and many more wounded, lacking clothes to binde vp their woundes, <hi>Traiane</hi> tare his owne ſhirt to ſupply their want in that behalfe.</q>
Being knowne within the citie, howe their ſuccorour was diſcomfited, and howe <hi>Traiane,</hi> to cure his wounded had rent his own ſhirt, they did feare the victorie, and were amazed at a worke of ſo great clemencie, and bothe theſe things were not a litle preiudiciall vnto king <hi>Decebal,</hi> chiefely for that he was proude and diſdainfull: for the good <hi>Traiane,</hi> if with his engins he ouerthrewe their caſtels, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fame of his good woorkes, he did robbe and ſteale the mindes of his armie.</p>
               <p>The citie of <hi>Myrtha</hi> beeing taken and rendred into the handes of <hi>Romaines,</hi> preſently king <hi>Decebal</hi> ſent Ambaſſadours vnto <hi>Traiane,</hi> aduertiſing that he woulde
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:3692:22"/>
become ſubiect vnto the <hi>Romaine</hi> Empire: vppon ſuche condition, that the thinges whereon they ſhould capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, were reaſonable, and ſuche thinges as they ſhoulde commaunde to be perfourmable: for otherwiſe, he and his were determined rather to dye with libertie, then to liue in bondage.

               <p>MAny caſtels being furniſhed, and others ouerthrowen and ſubuerted, and the armies being paide with king <hi>Decebals</hi> money: <hi>Traiane</hi> departed vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> leading with him the kinges ſonne for pledge, and other noble
men for Ambaſſadours: <q>becauſe it was a lawe much vſed and alſo obſerued amongeſt the <hi>Romaines,</hi> that it were of no value which was capitulate in the wars, if it were not confirmed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Senate at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </q>
The Ambaſſadours of king <hi>Decebal</hi> arriued at <hi>Rome</hi> before the Emperour <hi>Traiane:</hi> who bareheaded, their armour throwne downe, and their hands ioyned and lifted vp, did humbly beſéeche the Senate, that it might pleaſe them to pardon kinge <hi>Decebal</hi> the rebellion which he had committed againſt them, and to confirme all that which the Emperour <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iane</hi> had capitulate, bycauſe for that which had paſſed, he did repent him, and for time to come did offer amendes. With readie diſpoſition the <hi>Romaine</hi> ſenate did approue, allowe, and confirme all actes agréed vppon betwixt <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iane</hi> and the <hi>Datians:</hi> and preſently commaunded their armour to be reſtored them, &amp; to walk in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie at their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie:
<q>bycauſe it was a lawe inuiolable, that the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours whoſe Princes helde warres with the <hi>Romaine</hi> people, might weare no kinde of armour, either walke the ſtréetes at libertie without licence.</q>
Many and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme were the feaſtes wherewith the <hi>Romaines</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Emperour <hi>Traiane,</hi> &amp; very great was the riches y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he beſtowed in his triumph: &amp; admitting y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the <hi>Romains</hi> did much reioyce to ſee their Empire riche &amp; in great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: but it did muche more pleaſe them to beholde <hi>Traiane</hi> returned whole, ſafe, and aliue: for it is incredible, what affection and loue all men did beare him, and the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces beyonde all valure that for him they did offer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:3692:23"/>On the daye of his triumph, the ſonne of king <hi>Decebal</hi> was placed in the arche with <hi>Traiane,</hi> for that he was a verie childe: whome afterwardes he did intreate, not as a priſoner, but as his owne proper ſonne.
<q>In the conqueſt of the <hi>Datians,</hi> and in viſiting the <hi>Germaines, Traiane</hi> was deteyned willingly two yeares: and at his returne vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> he found not the common wealth in ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as he left the ſame, and thereof is no marueile: for Princes making warre with their enimies, preſently the citizens make peace with vices. That day in which <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iane</hi> entred triumphing into <hi>Rome,</hi> he that by chaunce was moſte noted in thoſe playes and pageantes, and of whome <hi>Traiane</hi> that day did take moſte delight, was a certeine maiſter of Enterludes named <hi>Pilas,</hi> who for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde of his traueile, did not craue of <hi>Traiane</hi> but licence to vſe his facultie, wherein <hi>Traiane</hi> did aunſwere him: <hi>Princes haue to conſider that their commaundements be iuſt: but after commaundement, for no requeſt or ſeruice they ought to reuoke the ſame.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <q>That which I will do for thée, ſhal be to paye thée yerely out of mine owne treaſure, as muche as thou maiſt gaine by playing in the ſtréetes of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Although <hi>Traiane</hi> went laden with armour, compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with affaires, occupied in warres, buſied in buyldings, importuned with friendes, tyred with enimies, and aboue all, moſte ſtudious in amplifying his fame, and to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate his memorie: he neuer grewe negligent in good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the common wealth. He was no leſſe atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue in hearing, either leſſe diligent in diſpatching baſe &amp; ciuil affaires, then thoſe caſes of great weight in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. Notwithſtanding he were much buſied in the affaires of warres, he did neuer the more growe negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the adminiſtration of iuſtice. All the time that he was remaining in <hi>Rome,</hi> once or twice a wéeke he did ſitt openly to diſpatche matters of iuſtice.</p>
               <p>For any motion that good <hi>Traiane</hi> had to be ſolitarie in his houſe, or for any diſeaſe whereby he was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3692:24"/>
into his chamber, either for any affaires that he <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ad for the warres, neuer man came to craue iuſtice, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome he denied audience. When any perſon came, much troubled and furious in complaining of ſome friend or enimie, preſently he ſtopte his eare with one of his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ſaying: that he reſerued the ſame, to heare the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Traiane</hi> did neuer ſitt to heare and determine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of iuſtice, but at the gate of the Emperour <hi>Titus,</hi> and in the place of <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> and being demaunded, why more there, then elſewhere: aunſwered, I place my ſelfe where iuſt Princes were wont to ſitt: becauſe in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring them, I may committ no want of iuſtice. <hi>Traiane</hi> being on horſebacke, and vpon the voyage of the ſeconde warres into <hi>Datia,</hi> there came a woman and ſaide vnto him: Emperour <hi>Traiane,</hi> I am poore, olde, and a widowe: and hauing but one daughter, one of thy houſholde ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts hath rauiſhed her. <hi>Traiane</hi> aunſwered: poore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, be not importune with mée: for I ſweare vnto thée, by the immortall Gods, that being returned from the warres, I will do thée iuſtice: to this the olde woman did replye: and what ſuretie haſt thou <hi>Traiane,</hi> to returne from the warres: hearing ſo byting an aunſwere, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he lighted on foote and deferred his departure, vntil he perfourmed iuſtice with the poore olde woman. <hi>Traiane</hi> helde for cuſtome, when any perſon did complaine, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he commaunded it to be written in a booke which he had in his chamber: &amp; this the good Prince did, to the ende to aſke accompt of the Iudge to whome he did remitt the ſame, or elſe for his own better remembrance for diſpatch thereof.</p>
               <p>In ſome thinges, ſome Princes were equall vnto <hi>Traiane,</hi> and in ſome thinges did ſurmount him, but in rectitude of iuſtice, there was no prince like him in <hi>Rome:</hi> for that he did neuer man wrong in iuſtice, either at any time had affection or paſſion in giuing ſentence. Many times <hi>Traiane</hi> did vſe to ſay: that for Princes to be Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3692:24"/>
it were right neceſſarie to be iuſt in their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: becauſe ſubiectes and vaſſals be more eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to do that which they ſée, then to obey in that which they are commaunded. <hi>Traiane</hi> was the firſt that placed patrones in the Senate, that ſhould defend the poore: and the firſt alſo that gaue order, that one daye in the wéeke, their cauſes ſhould be hearde. The Cenſours or Iudges of <hi>Rome,</hi> did ſit but two houres in the morning, and one at after noone, to heare cauſes: and <hi>Traiane</hi> did giue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they ſhould be reſident thrée houres before noone, and two houres at after noone, whereof <hi>Traiane</hi> was much praiſed, becauſe it was occaſion both to cut off ſuits, and to diſpatch ſuiters. In the dayes of <hi>Traiane,</hi> none that had charge of Iuſtice might augment his goods: but in that eſtate of riches or pouertie, wherein he began to gouerne, in the ſame he had to conſerue him ſelfe: and in repayme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his trauaile, beſides the rewardes which the Prince did giue him, his ſonnes were married with the goods of the common wealth.</p>
               <p>Being knowen vnto <hi>Traiane,</hi> howe immortall ſuites were in the Senate: he ordeined that all ſuites of <hi>Italie</hi> ſhould continue but one yere, and the ſuites of ſtraunge countries, but halfe a yere.
<q>
                     <hi>Traiane</hi> made diuers houſes in <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Cenſours and Iudges might aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to heare and adminiſter iuſtice, and alſo made ſtrong priſones, in ſuch wiſe, that this good Prince prouided, that the good ſhould be ſuccoured, and the euil chaſtiſed.</q>

King <hi>Decebal</hi> was then of the age of two and fourtie yeares: a Prince moſt certainly in body of perfect proportion, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in conuerſation, magnificent in ſpending, valiaunt in armes, diligent and carefull in the warres, although in the ſame moſt vnfortunate: the whiche loſt both him and his countrie: bicauſe <hi>little auaileth diligence, where good hap is contrarie.</hi> King <hi>Decebal</hi> was a Prince moſt vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, to match in contention with <hi>Traiane,</hi> whoe was a Prince moſt fortunate: bycauſe vnto the one, all thinges did happen vnto his owne liking: and to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, all things contrarie to that he did deſire.

Thoſe treaſures being brought into <hi>Traianes</hi> power, he diuided thereof amongeſt his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, vnto euerie man according to the merites of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice: and of his owne ſhare, the firſt that he commaunded was, to builde a moſt ſumptuous temple vnto the God <hi>Iupiter:</hi> wherein he left prouided, that for him ſelfe and the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> yearely ſacrifice to be offered. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edified there alſo the royall houſe, that is to ſay, where the kings of <hi>Datia</hi> did vſe to be reſident: whiche for the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qutie thereof was ſomewhat decayed, and through conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall warres, not well repayred: a worke moſt certeinely delec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:3692:27"/>
to behold, and pleaſant to dwell in. He repaired alſo many decayed bridges and mylles, vpon high wayes he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued their broken calſeys in all places, he did build newe houſes, and reedified others infinite that were burnt. He brake and made plaine many wayes vpon the ſharpe mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and rayſed many newe fortes, and renued the old: finally, you might hardly trauell a league throughout all the kingdome, wherein ſhoulde not be found ſome notable worke of <hi>Traiane.</hi>
                  <q>Not yet all ſatiſfied, he built vpon the riuer of <hi>Danubie</hi> a bridge of ſtone, which was ſo curious in the building, and ſo coſtly in the making, that fewe works did match it, but none did paſſe it. That bridge contained twentie arches in length, and euery piller of one ſquare ſtone, and the arches were of the height of an hundred and fiftie foote, wrought without cymet, and the diſtaunce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the pillers, were a hundred thréeſcore and two foote: and the breadth of the arches aloft was fortie foote: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all the reſt, the ſingularitie of the mould and faſhion was to be conſidered, and the richneſſe of the ſtone to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded: bycauſe the ſtone was of ſuch gloſſe, that in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it deſerued to be ſet in plate. It ſéemed incredible to mans iudgement, for a bridge to be made vpon that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: bicauſe the ſtreame was broad, déepe, in courſe very ſwifte, and aboue all the reſt, on no ſide it might be turned out of his chanell, to the end it might be drie at any time to lay the cymet.</q>
That building was ſo extreme, or to ſay better, ſo monſtrous, that it néeded to make experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of al high iudgements and capacities, and the <hi>Romaines</hi> there to ſhewe their ſtrengthes, and <hi>Traiane</hi> there to ſpend his treaſure: bicauſe in the worke there required great poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and in the order thereof great induſtrie: it is verie ſmall that the penne can magnifie, in reſpect of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which he ſéeth that beholdeth the ſame: for the better credite therof, at theſe dayes the pillers giue a muſter vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fierce waters: declaring the pryde of his power, and the riches of the emperour. <hi>Traiane</hi> would with that edifice giue terrour vnto the liuing, and admiration to his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:3692:28"/>
poſteritie, to giue manifeſt argument, that any thing may not be ſo impoſſible, eyther ſo hard, that with mans hand may not be enterpriſed, and with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> riches of <hi>Rome</hi> might not be finiſhed. The cauſe that moued <hi>Traian</hi> to build this coſtly bridge, ſo monſtrous, was, as they ſay, to the end the barbarous people on the other ſide <hi>Danubie,</hi> might come to fight w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the <hi>Romaines,</hi> although the riuer were ouerflo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen: and alſo that the <hi>Romaines</hi> that remained there, ſhuld not giue them ſelues to pleaſure and idleneſſe, when they conſidered them ſelues to be in the eye of the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. The Emperour <hi>Domitian</hi> had no ſuche mynde and valiantneſſe: whiche for feare that the barbarous people ſhould come to fight with the <hi>Romaine</hi> hoaſt, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded the arches of that bridge to be ouerthrowne: in ſuch wiſe, that the one made a bridge to prouoke the enimie to fight, and the other did raze the ſame for feare of battell.</p>

ſelues to kéepe and defend for him the kingdome of <hi>Datia.</hi> Incredible was the loue that all thoſe nations did beare vnto <hi>Traiane,</hi> which was well knowne when he departed from that countrie to goe vnto <hi>Rome:</hi> in that by all cities where he did paſſe, and by all wayes where he did trauell, ſo great were the teares and cries vttered by all perſons, that it ſéemed the grounde to tremble. In reſpect of the great largeſſe and proweſſe that <hi>Traiane</hi> had perfourmed in thoſe Prouinces, it was no maruell that his departing was ſo be wailed: bicauſe with his great benefites, he had won their hearts, and with his great and ſumptuous buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings he had ennobled his people. Vniuerſally of al friends and enimies, neuer prince as <hi>Traiane</hi> was ſo much feared in warres, either loued in peace. The cauſe wherby <hi>Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane</hi> obteined ſo great loue, and to be ſo well liked, and in ſuch eſpecial grace with al men, was, that with his frends he neuer vſed negligence, and alſo in readineſſe and ſtraite reckoning with his enimies: in ſuch wiſe, that ſuch as ſtood in his diſgrace by his wordes, they had to vnderſtand ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: but vnto ſuch as did bende to ſerue him, both in worde and déede he did manifeſt the ſame.

he gaue many and great offices of honour, and in the place did erect vnto them pictures of Alabaſter. <hi>Traiane</hi> made in <hi>Rome</hi> many and great Libraries: wherein he did place bookes of al ſciences, and of all languages, where ſtrangers might reade, and citizens learne.
<q>Where ſo euer <hi>Traiane</hi> entered, were it within the Empire, or in a ſtraunge king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, he was alwayes curious, in cauſing ſearch for fiue things: that is to ſay, horſes of good race, learned men of good inclination, newe armour, faire women, and auncient bookes.

Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane</hi> departed from <hi>Rome</hi> by the waye of <hi>Sicyl:</hi> where he ſtayed al the Winter, and to auoyde idleneſſe he ſcarſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lefte any place in the whole Iſlande perſonally vnuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, none that were then aliue in <hi>Sicyl,</hi> might remember to haue ſéene any <hi>Romaine</hi> Prince within the ſame: for whiche cauſe <hi>Traiane</hi> founde many thinges to be repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the walles, and muche more to be amended in their cuſtomes and manners. <hi>Traiane</hi> being infourmed, that many ſtraunge ſhippes did lurke in the hauen of <hi>Mecina</hi> to ſpoyle, and many pyrates barkes did haunt and retyre vnto the ſame, to execute their robberies, in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon went to the viewe thereof, and at his owne coſte com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded thrée bulwarkes to be made, at the mouth of the hauen: whiche eyther for want of diligence of the one part, or too muche malice on the other ſide, the caſe was thus: that before it coulde be finiſhed, the pyrates had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne it. Amongeſt the <hi>Panormitains,</hi> whiche be they of <hi>Palermo,</hi> and the inhabitaunts of <hi>Mecina,</hi> of olde time had continued great contention: betwixt whome <hi>Traiane</hi> not without great trauell, determined &amp; finiſhed all quarelles and debates: and brought to paſſe, that from thence foorth they continued in great friendſhippe.

               <p>The Winter being paſt, and the Spring come, <hi>Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane</hi> paſſed into <hi>Africa,</hi> and did lande in the hauen, where olde <hi>Carthage</hi> in time paſt was ſituate: &amp; not finding one ſtone vpon an other, to giue teſtimonie of the foundation thereof: they ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſayd. It grieueth me that <hi>Carthage</hi> ſo greatly reſiſted <hi>Rome:</hi> but it more forethinketh me, that <hi>Rome</hi> ſhoulde not be ſatiſfied, but with the totall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction thereof. In the place where olde <hi>Carthage</hi> ſtoode, <hi>Traiane</hi> did builde a caſtle more faire then ſtrong, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected therein two counterfets. the one of <hi>Hanibal</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> and the other of <hi>Scipio</hi> the <hi>African:</hi> but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently vpon his departing from that countrie, the pyrates layde it flat on the earth. Incontinent after <hi>Traiane</hi> had arriued into <hi>Africa,</hi> there grewe a generall peſtilence throughout the ſame, for whiche cauſe he coulde neyther goe to ſée that he deſired, eyther perfourme that whiche he determined. And as the peſtilence grewe ſo cruel, <hi>Traiane</hi> was conſtrained to retyre vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> port of <hi>Bona,</hi> which was ſomwhat more ſound: and from thence he ſent for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals of the <hi>Numidians,</hi> and alſo of the <hi>Mauritans:</hi> who incontinently in preſence of <hi>Traiane,</hi> were made friends, and left and committed into his onely handes all their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. Amongeſt all the Princes of this worlde, <hi>Traiane</hi> obteined this excellencie: <hi>That neuer man came into his preſence, that denied him that, whiche he craued, eyther diſobeyed him wherein he commaunded: bycauſe in his commaundements hee was verie wiſe, and in requeſting verie humble.

lefte as great memoriall in <hi>Africa,</hi> as he did in <hi>Datia.

               <p>
                  <hi>Traiane</hi> gaue many Priuileges vnto the <hi>Gauditains,</hi> as vnto his naturall friendes: amongeſt whiche, two were moſt notable: namely, that they ſhoulde be citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> and paye no cuſtome or tribute, for any merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize whiche they tranſported. <hi>Traiane</hi> did builde in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize</hi> a moſt ſumptuous temple vnto God <hi>Genius:</hi> whiche the <hi>Romaines</hi> helde for the God of byrthe. He made alſo a calſey of ſtone along the ſhoare: but it was not all fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, when by the furie of the water it was all deſtroyed. He intended to repayre the pillers of <hi>Hercules,</hi> whiche by their great antiquitie were then conſumed: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſuaded by certaine perſons to erect others in his owne name, to the ende that in time to come, they might be called the pillers of <hi>Traiane,</hi> and not of <hi>Hercules:</hi> he anſwered: that whiche I ought to doe is, that as <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> came from <hi>Graecia</hi> vnto <hi>Spaine,</hi> to obtaine honour: ſo ought I from <hi>Spaine</hi> to goe into <hi>Graecia</hi> to winne fame.</p>

                  <hi>Traiane</hi> commaunded the bridge of <hi>Alcantara</hi> in <hi>Spaine</hi> to be made, a worke that laſteth to this our age: wherein concurreth ſtatelineſſe, ſubtiltie, cunning, and profite.

                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:3692:31"/>
whiche be lodging or bayting places: and ſo to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode, not bicauſe the hiſtories do clearely report thereof, but by the pillers which vpon that way be erected: which ſay in their grauen letters, that they were placed there in the dayes of <hi>Traiane.</hi> And he that will be curious to goe and ſée, (as I many times haue gone to ſée and reade, and alſo to meaſure:) ſhal finde within the ſayde boundes, the name of no other Prince but of <hi>Traiane:</hi> and before the <hi>Caſur</hi> which is a towne, neyther after the vents of <hi>Capar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> which be lodgings, vpon no piller ſhall they finde <hi>Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane</hi> written. The cauſe wherefore the Conſul <hi>Publius Fabatus</hi> did raiſe that calſey, was to make a diuiſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Vetical</hi> Prouince, which is <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> and the Prouince of <hi>Luſitania,</hi> which is <hi>Portugal:</hi> diuiding from <hi>Ciuil</hi> to <hi>Salamanca,</hi> all on the left hand of the calſey in olde time being <hi>Luſitania,</hi> and all on the right hande <hi>Andalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zia.</hi> Betwixt the Proconſul of <hi>Betica,</hi> and the Proconſul of <hi>Luſitania,</hi> there did ariſe great contention, vppon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion of their boundes: wherevpon this large and ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous calſey was erected and perfourmed. Vpon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of <hi>Gadiana, Traiane</hi> commaunded a long bridge to be made, on the middeſt whereof he built a market place for the merchants of both people, to trade and concurre. This bridge appertaineth to the citie of <hi>Merida,</hi> which at this day appeareth verie large, and had in the middeſt thereof a diuiſion, ſtretching vppe into the riuer, the hurle of a ſtone, whiche on both ſides came backe vnto the bridge, continued, directed, and ſuſtained by walles, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe wherof was the place or market. When the <hi>Greeks</hi> did firſt giue foundation vnto <hi>Merida,</hi> they made therein two ſtreates, and the riuer <hi>Gadiana</hi> betwixt them both, and where <hi>Merida</hi> nowe ſtandeth, was the ſtronger, and that on the other ſide the riuer was more delectable: in ſuche wiſe, that they helde the one to retyre vnto in time of warre: and the other to delight in time of peace. As the Conſul <hi>Publius Fabatus</hi> made diuiſion of <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> the ſtreate on the other ſide the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3692:32"/>

The proſperitie of <hi>Merida</hi> continued, vntil the time that the <hi>Gothes</hi> entered <hi>Spaine:</hi> whiche holding warre with the <hi>Silingues,</hi> being in thoſe dayes Lordes of <hi>Andaluzia:</hi> fortifying them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues in <hi>Merida,</hi> by the <hi>Gothes</hi> were there ouercome, and thoſe generous, ſumptuous, and auncient buildings, thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen

               <p>AFter that <hi>Traiane</hi> had viſited in <hi>Spaine</hi> the Prouince of <hi>Betica,</hi> of <hi>Luſitania,</hi> and the Prouince of <hi>Carpenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> he came through the prouince of <hi>Tarragona:</hi> in which yere in the whole land, there was great ſcarſitie of bread: wherby <hi>Traiane</hi> was conſtrained to ſhorten his iourney, and to haſten his imbarkage: in ſuch manner, that the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence draue him out of <hi>Africa,</hi> and hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger out of <hi>Spaine.

Traiane</hi> departed <hi>Spaine,</hi> with determination not to ſtay, vntill his arriuall in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and there to take the way vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greater <hi>Armenia:</hi> would neuer take land in any porte of <hi>Italie,</hi> but paſſing like pylgrimes, made no ſtay, but onely to renue their victuals. All thoſe whiche trauelled with <hi>Traiane,</hi> were aſtonied to ſée him paſſe the portes of his kingdomes, as if it had bene the lande of enimies. <hi>Traiane</hi> had a capteine named <hi>Valerius Gracchus:</hi> vnto whom the Emperour did beare ſpeciall affection, and did eſtéeme him as a kinſman: vnto this man they ſay, that <hi>Traiane</hi> ſayd, in great ſecrecie. <hi>If I had found warres in Sicyl, Africa, or Spaine, as I found in Datia, whereby I might haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined ſome victorie, I woulde not haue paſſed without landing in Italie: but ſince it is thus come to paſſe, I ſweare by the immortall Gods, to ſet no foote a land in Italie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til I deſerue to enter triumphing into Rome.</hi> High &amp; verie high were theſe wordes, worthy and right worthy to be written in the hearts of Princes: to beholde this Prince that baniſhed him ſelfe from the delightes of his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per kingdomes, to ſéeke fame in ſtraunge landes.

                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:3692:33"/>Without conſuming of many dayes, or imploying of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny armies, the <hi>Parthians</hi> made peace with <hi>Traiane,</hi> and the <hi>Armenians</hi> did yeald them ſelues as ouercome. From <hi>Parthimiſires</hi> king of <hi>Armenians,</hi> the kingdome was remoued, and both crowne and kingdome <hi>Traiane</hi> gaue with his owne handes vnto his ſonne: and this he did, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe king <hi>Parthimiſires</hi> had ſayd: that of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and not of the <hi>Romaines,</hi> he was crowned king: in ſuche wiſe, that the good <hi>Traiane</hi> in remouing the kingdome fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the father, did execute iuſtice: and in giuing it to the ſonne, gaue a ſhewe of his clemencie. <hi>Traiane</hi> was not ſatiſfied, that the <hi>Parthians</hi> ſhoulde haue peace, and become tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries vnto the <hi>Romaines,</hi> but that king <hi>Parthurus</hi> by the handes of <hi>Traiane,</hi> muſt be crowned: and ſo it came to paſſe, that knéeling vpon his knées, he receiued his crowne, kiſſed his hande, and conſented to pay tribute. <hi>Traiane</hi> did marche through all thoſe Prouinces and kingdomes, and vnto the kinges that did yeald obedience, benignly he did intreate them, and in their kingdomes did confirme them: and vnto ſuche as did vſe reſiſtaunce, vnto others he gaue their kingdomes, and ſent them priſoners vnto <hi>Rome. Traiane</hi> helde for cuſtome, that in all principall cities of kingdomes or Prouinces: that he had taken by force of armes, he did commaunde to erect a moſt ſtrong caſtle, wherevnto his armies did repayre: and a right ſumptuous temple, wherein to worſhippe the Goddes of <hi>Rome.</hi> As <hi>Traiane</hi> did paſſe and trauell, viſite and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere all the thrée partes of the world, that is to ſay, <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Europa:</hi> in all which countries he did trauell to leaue of him ſelfe immortall fame: the teſtimonie wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of maketh it credible, that all the <hi>Romaine</hi> princes ioyntly haue not erected ſo many buildings, as <hi>Traiane</hi> onely did performe. <hi>Traiane</hi> did leade his armies verie well furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, ordered, corrected, and alſo in great ſubiection: &amp; this procéeded, that alwaies in his own perſon he did acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany the ſame, and helde them both paide and rewarded: for as he did vſe to ſay, <hi>The hoaſt that of his owne proper

Prince is not viſited and paide, is ſildome or neuer in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</hi> When <hi>Traiane</hi> was in the warres, in his féeding and apparel, he did rather ſéeme a companion, then an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Rome:</hi> for that ſildome he went vnarmed, and many were the dayes wherein he did eate ſtanding. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a bodie ſomewhat drie and of great ſinowes, he was moſte patient in tedious trauaile of warres: that is to ſay, in ſuffering hunger, colde, thirſte, wette, ſnowe, heate, &amp; perils, whiche he refuſed not as a cowarde, but ſought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out as one of a valiant mind: for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in all hazardes &amp; perils, he neuer ſaide vnto his captaines, <hi>go: but, let vs go: do: but, let vs do: fight: but, let vs fight.</hi> He gaue in charge vnto his armies, not to attempt to burne houſes, ſet fire in corne, ouerthrowe milles, or cut downe orchardes: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, that theſe thinges are to be obteined, but not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Traiane</hi> would take any citie, he did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploye his force in any thing more, then to depriue the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of their waters. In the campes of his enimies, he did cauſe to be ſowen falſe newes: that is to wite: that if he had victuals, to ſaye, that he wanted: that if he had mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to ſaye, it was ſpent: that if he had muche people, that they were gone: that if he would ſhortly giue an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, to ſaye, that he would departe: and by this meanes he brought his enimies into negligence, while in meane time he did fortifie his armies. <hi>Traiane</hi> was of greate li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie vnto ſuch as diſcouered the enimies ſecretes: and ioyntly therewith, of no leſſe prouidence, for the entering of ſpies within his campes. When he helde warre with any citie or countrye, he did not permitt his ſouldiers to ſpoile the borders thereof. for he helde opinion, that ſmal profit might riſe to ſpoile the poore villages: and greate hurte and offence vnto the armies, by want of victuals. Vnto a captaine that tooke a ploughman, &amp; kilde his two Oxen at the ploughe, <hi>Traiane</hi> commaunded to be bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with great ignominie, and to giue the ploughman his horſe, his armour, and all his wages that was due. For no fault <hi>Traiane</hi> commaunded any man to be ſlaine in the

warres, but onely him that ſlept being of the watche, or the captaine that ranne awaye out of the battel, or did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhe any woman. <hi>Traiane</hi> was ſo pitifull, that vſually
<q>he did pardon all negligences, eſpecially in the warres, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept two faultes which he did neuer remitt, that is to ſay, ſuch as blaſphemed the Gods, and rauiſhed women. <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iane</hi> was verie diligent and careful in viſiting his camps, and to kéepe a reckoning of all his armies: and this he did to the ende that no vagabonds ſhould wander amongeſt them: in ſuch wiſe, that no man went to the warres, that did not beare armour, and go to the battell.</q>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Traiane</hi> held

               <p>THE <hi>Romaines</hi> did much deſire, that when <hi>Traiane</hi> did ſaile from <hi>Spaine</hi> into <hi>Aſia,</hi> that he ſhould haue landed in <hi>Italie:</hi> but when they vnderſtoode of the great victories and proſperities which he had receiued in <hi>Aſia,</hi> great was the ioye and ſportes which were done at <hi>Rome.</hi> In times paſt, ſome Princes ouercame the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and others of them were ouercome: but neuer prince, as <hi>Traiane,</hi> did make them by feare yeald vp their kingdome: and that of his owne will, knéeling vppon his knées, would by a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi> Prince be crowned. The <hi>Parthians</hi> were a people ſo vntameable to be ſubdued, that they ſaide of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues: the Gods could abſolutely confound them: but impoſſible for men to ouercome them. Many dayes they were deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Senate vpon determination, of the manner of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3692:34"/>
thankes which they ſhould write vnto <hi>Traiane,</hi> and what enſignes of honour they ſhould ſende vnto him: ſince by his vertue they were all honoured, and by his valiant actes, feared throughout the worlde. All the Senate came to conſent to one aduice, the which in déede was very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and noble: that is to vnderſtande, that all maner of coyne ſhould be melted within the Empire, and made a certeine newe money in the name of <hi>Traiane:</hi> wherein <hi>Traiane</hi> was ingrauen, and in the compaſſe thereof, theſe letters were written: <hi>Imp. Vlp. Tr. Opti. Da. Parth. P. P. Tr. P. Con.</hi> 2. <hi>Sem. Aug.</hi> Which is to ſaye: this is the Emperour <hi>Vlpius Traianus, which was verie good, and right fortunate: he ouercame the Parthians, triumphed ouer the Datians, father of the countrie, tribune of the people, two times Conſul, his memorie ſhalbe immortal.</hi> Great was the ioy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Traiane</hi> receiued, when he ſawe that money which the Senate had made: and when he read the writing therin conteined: but of all the titles whiche they gaue him, he gloried in none ſo much as to intitle him <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perator optimus,</hi> that is to ſaye: beſt Emperour: for he affirmed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all other titles he had obteined by armes, but this other with vertues.
<q>For defence of colde, &amp; prouiſion of victuals, <hi>Traiane</hi> retired in Winter vnto the citie and prouince of <hi>Antioche:</hi> where whiles he remained, ſuche &amp; ſo fierce an earthquake happened, as neuer in the worlde paſt was euer heard or ſéene. The chaunce was thus, that on the 22. day of October, before the breake of the day, ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly there roſe ſuch winde &amp; ſtorme ſo extreme &amp; impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that puld vp trées, beate downe birdes, threw down tiles, &amp; ſhooke the houſes: forthwith it began to lighten and thunder, &amp; did ſo ſparckle and flame, that being night, it ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be broade daye. After the thunder and lightening, preſently did followe ſo terrible tempeſtes and flaſhinges of fire, which with their furious violence, brake downe ſtatelye houſes, ſet hilles on fire, kild men at the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deine: finally, it ſeemed not, but that all the world was on fire, and that the earth did open. And if the earth were
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3692:35"/>
afflicted, no doubt but the Sea was cruelly tormented: for the waters began to ſwell, the windes to alter, fiſhes to be troubled, the ayre to be darkened: and that which ſéemed moſte terrible, the waters did ſo yell, roare, braye, and rage, as if they had béene wilde, fierce, &amp; moſte cruell beaſtes: preſently vppon the ſouden there followed, ſuche, and ſo ſtraunge a heate, that it conſtrained al men to giue aire vnto their breaſtes, vnbuckle their gyrdle, to throwe off their cloathes, to mount into galleries, their bodies to ſweate: and that which was woorſte of all, that if they went foorth into the ayre, the violence thereof did ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe them: if into the ſea, the rage therof did drowne them. As the windes did vſe their furie ſo ſtraunge or neuer ſéene, and the earth ſo parched and dryed by the drought of the Summer, they raiſed ſo ſharpe a duſt, that the ayre ſéemed to be farſed or compound with duſt. The matter was marueilous monſtruous, and terrible to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde: the ayre ſo thicke with duſt, the Seas to yell and roare, the windes in ſo furious combat, that one might not ſée another, that they durſt not open their mouthes, neither drawe breath at their noſtrils: for ſo greate was the duſt that they did ſwallowe and receiue into their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that ſoudeinly they fell downe dead vppon the earth. All theſe calamities, and marueilous wonders, were no doubt verie fearefull: but vniuerſally not ſo daungerous: for although many did periſhe, many alſo were ſaued. Then preſently began the earth to quake ſo ſtrangely and vnuſually, that olde houſes did fall, walles did open, tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers did cleaue, the monuments did rent, and ſtones did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter eche other. In ſome places, the houſes were vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ouerthrowne, in other partes halfe throwne down, in other places walles opened, in other ſome places trées pulde vp by the rootes, domeſticall beaſtes ſlaine: finally, there was no ſtréete in the whole citie, wherein the earth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quake had not vſed his violence. If ſuch deſtruction was executed amongeſt trées and ſtones: howe great was the calamitie that paſſed amongeſt men? the caſe was right
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:3692:35"/>
lamentable to heare men crye, women ſcriche, children waile, beaſtes howle and braye, one croſſing and encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering another, ſome dead, ſome with broken heades, ſome with broken legges, ſome lamed in their armes, and ſome ſtriken cleane through the bodie. At ſuche time as theſe thinges did chaunce, great numbers of people were come from all the partes of the worlde vnto <hi>Antioche,</hi> ſome to ſée <hi>Traiane,</hi> ſome to aſke iuſtice, ſome that went to the warres, ſome brought priſoners, and others that were ſtraungers: and in ſo great a multitude, there was no man that eſcaped either deadly wounded or hurte, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one woman and one ſlaue. Vppon that night of the earth quake, <hi>Traiane</hi> was lodged in a place of pleaſure without the citie, who leaping out at a windowe, not with ſuch ſpéede, but that he was hurte on his right arme not able to ſaye of the cauſe, whether it procéeded, of tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, tile, or ſtone. <hi>Traiane</hi> was ſo terrified with the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, that all the time in which he ſtaide at <hi>Antioche,</hi> he would not remaine in any houſe, but in the fieldes in a tent, wherein he did eate and ſléepe. Many dayes after theſe thinges did paſſe, certeine perſons walking to behold the falne houſes, heard the voice of a woman: and digging very déepe, they found a woman and her childe, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hollowneſſe of a vawt were eſcaped: a thing admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, how the mother without meate ſo long time, might haue milke to nouriſhe her childe. In reedifying of other houſes, they found a dead woman, and a liue childe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the breſt. At the time of the earthquake in <hi>Antioch,</hi> the mountaine <hi>Caucaſus</hi> did ſo open and tremble, that all the cities adioyning, doubted to be ouerwhelmed with the fal therof. Running riuers of immortall memorie became drye. Springs neuer ſéene or heard of, did flow &amp; remaine. and olde fountaines for euermore dried vp: many hilles made plaine, and many vallies made euen. Finally, there was no houſe in <hi>Antioche,</hi> or within the compaſſe of the territories therof, that was not totally deſtroyed, or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged after a maner into ſome other order or faſhion.</q>

               <p>NOwe when Summer was come, <hi>Traiane</hi> prepared to departe the confines of <hi>Antioche</hi> towardes the iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> to conquer that countrie, if that by peace they did not yeald the ſame: and being arriued at the great riuer <hi>Euphrates,</hi> he found the ſhips burnt, all the bridges broken, and all the <hi>Barbarians</hi> in armes, with a minde to dye, or to defend their countries. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of <hi>Traians</hi> approche, made an vtter ſpoile of all their woods, to remoue all meanes of renuing their nauie, or to reedifie bridges. <hi>Traiane</hi> had intelligence that farre from thence, certeine ſhippes vppon the hill <hi>Niſibin</hi> were a making, whiche preſently he ſent for, and brought in cartes, and in very ſhorte ſpace, a flote vppon <hi>Euphrates</hi> rigged and armed. The riuer <hi>Euphrates</hi> being paſſed, <hi>Traiane</hi> founde another riuer named <hi>Peſsin,</hi> ioyning vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hill <hi>Cardius,</hi> which alſo was of great ſtrength, and almoſt impaſſable, but <hi>Traiane</hi> brake vp his ſhippes, and once more by land did carrie the ſame vnto that riuer: wherin he fought with the <hi>Barbarians</hi> that defended their bankes. And as they after reported, vtterly determined rather to dye, then to ſubmitt themſelues to ſubiection. But that they conceiued, <hi>Traiane</hi> to be no mortall man, which would fight againſt them, but ſome of the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Gods that came to deſtroye them: moued thereunto, in beholding <hi>Traians</hi> readie carriage for ſhippes by lande, as they had by Sea. That countrie was named the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of <hi>Adiabena:</hi> which being all ouerrunne &amp; brought vnder ſubiection: he paſſed vnto <hi>Arbela,</hi> and vnto <hi>Angua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guemela</hi> two moſt opulent prouinces, in whoſe fieldes, in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:3692:36"/>
the olde worldes paſt, the greate king <hi>Darius,</hi> was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of <hi>Alexander Magnus. Traiane</hi> ſpent all that Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in conquering thoſe prouinces: whiche although they differ in names, yet differ not in ſeignorie, becauſe they be alwayes annexed vnto the kingdome <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> whiche the <hi>Barbarians</hi> changing the <hi>S.</hi> into <hi>T.</hi> do call the ſame <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyria.</hi> And nowe when Summer began to decline, <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iane</hi> determined to winter at <hi>Babylon:</hi> in all which way he neither found enimies that did reſiſt him, either friends to accompany him: becauſe thoſe deſertes be ſo ſolitarie and drye, that hardly bruite beaſtes be found in the ſame.
<q>Before <hi>Traiane</hi> did enter <hi>Babylon,</hi> he would firſt perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſée the lake of <hi>Bytamin:</hi> the water whereof hath this propertie, that bricke, tile, ſande, lime, or chalke, that is tempered therewith, maketh a cyment thereof ſo harde and ſtrong, that yeldeth not vnto ſtone or yron. With this water the tiles and brickes were made, and all other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tempered, that did erect all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> walles of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Alſo <hi>Traiane</hi> went to ſée the caue where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water came ſoaking foorth, whereout procéeded a ſtench ſo peſtilential, that kilde all cattel that came neare thereunto, and all birdes that did flye ouer the ſame. Men that paſſe that waye dare not venter the viewe thereof, muche leſſe to approch the ſmell, except the Eunuches that be gelded, which feare not to beholde, neither are indaungered by the ſauour.</q>
                  <hi>Traiane</hi> might not be ſatiſfied with the view and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of <hi>Babylon,</hi> muche delighting to viewe the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite antiquities therein conteined, and had thereof great compaſſion: and alſo ſaide it many times, howe many and howe renowned Princes had conſumed there their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and imployed the chiefeſt parte of their life, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate their fame, which were nowe forgotten, and their ſtately buyldings vtterly ruinated and falne downe. <hi>Traiane</hi> attempted a certeine woorke within that lande which did not onely excell all that he had done in <hi>Rome, Italic, Sicyl, Datia,</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> but alſo all that <hi>Ninus, Belus, Semyramis,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> had made in <hi>Babylon.

Traiane</hi> was of ſo high thoughtes, and ſo ſingular in his conceites, which he attempted, and in his buyldings which he erected, he was not ſatiſfied that others ſhould thinke him equall with Princes paſt: but iudge and confeſſe him to be ſingular amongeſt the reſt.

Vppon that chanell <hi>Traiane</hi> did builde a moſte ſtately and a right loftie bridge, a ſtrong caſtell, a riche and ſumptuous palace, and certeine gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deines and orchardes moſt pleaſant, and on either ſide the riuer, he built faire houſes to dwell in, and ſtore houſes for merchaunts: and to place there his perpetuall memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, did name the ſame <hi>Traianicall Babylon.</hi> This buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding endured not long, and the cauſe thereof procéeded, that the riuer <hi>Euphrates</hi> had his channell more high then the riuer <hi>Tygris,</hi> whereby <hi>Tygris</hi> did increaſe, and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> diminiſh: and the <hi>Babylonians</hi> doubted the one for want of water to be loſt: and the other with the furie of the water to be deſtroyed.

               <p>THE land of <hi>Parthians</hi> being ſtayed &amp; pacified, <hi>Traiane</hi> was in diſpoſition to go to <hi>Rome</hi>: partly to reſt, and to ceaſe from traueile, and chiefely to triumph ouer ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nations and kingdomes: but being aduertiſed of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of the <hi>Agarens,</hi> and that the <hi>Romaine</hi> pretours were fledd: preſently <hi>Traiane</hi> departed vnto the lande of <hi>Agarens,</hi> which is in <hi>Arabia,</hi> hauing a citie as principall of their prouince, very little, but marueilous ſtrong: the deſtinie whereof was ſuch, that being ſieged by infinite Princes, was neuer taken or ouercome. For defence of that citie, the nature and ſituation of the countrie did not a litle helpe: for that the aſſailants had neither wood or timber to aduaunce their engins, either water or forage, for reliefe of them ſelues or cattel: &amp; the ſame vnto ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers not vſed thereunto, did rather ſéeme to burne, then to giue light. <hi>Traiane</hi> commaunded an aſſault to be giuen vnto the citie: the moſt valiant captaines being mounted vpon the wall, at an inſtant ſome were ſlaine, and ſome ouerthrowen. <hi>Traiane</hi> diſguiſed, and in diſpoſition to viewe the citie, was of the enimies both knowen, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and his Squire ſlaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:3692:39"/>The <hi>Agarens</hi> beeing demaunded, if at that inſtant they had notice of the Emperours perſon: they aunſwered, that his grauitie, and the maieſtie of his preſence did diſcouer his eſtate. <hi>Traiane</hi> being at that ſiege, there aroſe terrible lightening and thunder, which in that countrie was neuer ſéene: and beſides, there deſcended vppon the <hi>Romaine</hi> campe flies ſo many &amp; importune, that both their meate and drinke, and their owne perſons, were continually co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with the ſame. <hi>Traiane</hi> conſidering the citie to be impregnable, did retire his armie. They ſaye, that he ſaide, at his retraite: <hi>Since the Agarens, with mine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, either my wordes, be neither ſubdued or perſuaded: the deſtinies haue reſerued this triumph for ſome other Prince in the world to come.</hi>
                  <q>In the prouince of <hi>Cyrene, Traiane</hi> had a greate armie both of <hi>Greekes</hi> as of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines</hi>: and the pretor of thoſe armies was a certeine <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi> named <hi>Andreas,</hi> againſt whome the Iewes of thoſe partes did rebell, and ſlewe both captaine, <hi>Greekes,</hi> and <hi>Romaines.</hi> The <hi>Iewes</hi> were not onely contented to haue ſlaine the <hi>Romaines,</hi> but alſo brought the dead bodies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſhambles, and there did quarter, cut in péeces, and ſolde by weight: &amp; with no leſſe appetite did eate that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine fleſhe, then if it had béene hennes and feſants. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding crueltie vppon crueltie, they brought forth certeine <hi>Romaines</hi> whiche they had in priſon, and did wage one with another, a denéere, or a point, to ſtrike off the head of a <hi>Romaine</hi> at a blowe. Another thing, not more vile then horrible, the <hi>Iewes</hi> committed vppon thoſe miſerable <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,</hi> that is, they fleyed them quicke, and tanned their ſkinnes for leather: and further, with greateſt diſgrace, did cut off their moſt ſhamefaſt partes, and plaide and toſt them as a ball in the market place. As the <hi>Iewes</hi> left no <hi>Romaine</hi> vnſlaine, ſo left they no crueltie or kind of death that they did not experiment: and in this matter, we haue no leſſe to marueile, at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hearts of the one to execute, then of the patience of the other to ſuffer. That which was don by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Iewes</hi> of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> was executed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

                  </q>
When theſe ſorrowfull newes came vnto <hi>Traiane,</hi> he was very ſicke: but notwithſtanding prouided what was conuenient for ſo deſperate a caſe: and preſently ſent <hi>Lucius</hi> into <hi>Cyrene, Marcus</hi> into <hi>Cypres,</hi> and <hi>Seuerus</hi> into <hi>Aegypt</hi>: who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſo great ſpoiles among the people, and executed ſo cruell iuſtice vppon the inhabitants, that if the dead had béene liuing, they would haue yelded them ſelues for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently reuenged. <hi>Elius Adrianus</hi> was captaine vnto <hi>Traiane</hi> for the guarde of <hi>Syria,</hi> and hearing what had paſſed in this matter, ſoudeinly he deſcended into <hi>Iurie,</hi> and did execute therein a greate ſlaughter: and they of <hi>Cypres,</hi> receiuing warning by this great treaſon, did ordeine that no <hi>Iewe</hi> ſhoulde dare to inhabite, or paſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that kingdome: and that if tempeſt ſhoulde bring them by chaunce into that Ilande, to haue no redemption ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but by the loſſe of their heades.</p>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Traiane</hi> naturally was alwayes of greate health: but
in the traueile of ſo many prouinces, following of ſo many warres, ſayling vpon ſo many Seas, and enduring ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny woundes, the griefe or diſeaſe of the piles did not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle vexe him. But the caſe was thus: that from the daye that <hi>Traiane</hi> might not paſſe into the <hi>Indies,</hi> they neuer ſawe health in his perſon, or ioy in his face. Through the cauſe or diſeaſe of the piles, at chaunge of weather, <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iane</hi> had a fluxe of bloude, which for his health was very profitable. Either by the colde which he had paſſed, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which in him ſelfe he ſuffered, or greate age, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was laden: there increaſed vnto the good Prince, a Paſma or numneſſe of his arme, and his purgation by fluxe of bloud was ſtopped. Ioyning vnto the citie of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuca,</hi> there were certeine famous bathes, whereunto ſicke people of all partes did concurre, whether <hi>Traiane</hi> did cauſe him ſelfe to be remoued, to make proofe for reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie of his health.

thoſe bathes did not profite, but hinder: for being weake, conſumed, and ſpent, although he had force to bathe, he had no ſtrength to ſweate.

                     <hi>Adrian</hi> was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſharpe of wit, and of great life, moſt apparant, in that he was not ſatiſfied, to knowe what ſome men did knowe: but trauelled to haue ſkill in all things that men vnderſtoode: with Philoſophers he woulde diſpute, with maiſters at weapons he woulde fight, with artificers he would worke, and with painters he would paint. <hi>Adrian</hi> did praiſe him ſelfe, and according to writings of olde time, he had great reaſon ſo to do: bycauſe there was no Art, ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, occupation, or inuention in the worlde, that he knew not, or at the leaſt did not trauell to knowe. When <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> was young, he was but of ſmall patience, for that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured not any to excell him, neyther yet to compare with him: and rare was that quarell, which he did not make or mainteine.</q>
When <hi>Tatian, Adrians</hi> tutor, did reprehend him for his impatience, and bycauſe he was not mylde, as the young man his couſen <hi>Emilius,</hi> he made anſwere: <hi>My couſen Emilius is not patient, but for that he is a coward, and I by quarelling, am become valiaunt.</hi> Neyther being a childe, or growne to more yeares: <hi>Adrian</hi> vſed not to breake foorth into foule wordes, although they ſayde, or did him great iniuries: but indéede, although his toung were ſlowe, his handes were very ready. <hi>Adrian</hi> was of a ſound bodie, except that ſometimes he complained of his left eare, and that one of his eyes at times did water: but

two euils did not hinder his hearing, much leſſe his ſight.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. Of ſome euill inclinations that poſſeſſed and had power in Adrian.</head>
               <p>THe Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> did muche delight in hunting, which he did not exerciſe in the plaines, but in moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines for he tooke no care to flée with haukes, but to fight with fierce beaſtes, to make a ſhewe of his valiauntneſſe. So giuen and ſo venterous was <hi>Adrian</hi> in his chace, that with great reaſon I will not ſay did reproue, but note, the time that he conſumed: and that not onely for much time he ſpent therein, but for that many times he was in great daunger. It hapned ſomtimes, that in following the chace of wilde beaſts, <hi>Adrian</hi> did looſe himſelf, in thoſe rough and craggie mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taines: wherof there folowed not a few times, that he would haue eaten if he had had breade, and woulde haue dranke, if he had had water. When he went to hunt, he carried his croſbowe to ſhoote, his quiuer of quarels, and his wallet of victuals: and alwayes did place him, in the pace, where the beaſt ſhould paſſe: and had ſo little feare, and ſo deſirous of chace, that if it were a beare, he did exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute ſome aduenture: and if it were a Lion, he did abide him. It is not read, that he ſiue any Lion, but one: but beares and other cruell beaſtes, that he ſiue with his owne hands, were infinite. <hi>Adrian</hi> followed moſt fiercely a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine beaſt with ſo great deſire, and did ſo trauel to attain the ſame, that he fell ouer a rocke, put his ſhoulder out of ioynt, brake one of his legs, and caſt much bloud out of his mouth. In the Prouince of <hi>Miſia, Adrian</hi> built a citie, which he did name <hi>The chace of Adrian,</hi> bicauſe there he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to pitch his Pauilion, and from thence at mornings he went foorth to hunt, and at night did returne to bed. He had an horſſe very ready for hunting, which would ſtaye and make ready as a man, when he vnderſtoode the chace comming: and therewithall ranne as ſure downe the hill, as vp the hill. This horſſe was named <hi>Boryſtenes,</hi> which being deade, <hi>Adrian</hi> did not only cauſe to be buried with
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:3692:42"/>
muche honour, but alſo commaunded for the ſame a very riche ſepulchre of Marble to be made and erected.
<q>
                     <hi>Adrian</hi> did muche eſtéeme and delight, to paynt figures and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfets very naturally, and to graue in Marble with great ſkil and deuice: ſometimes in waxe to make newe inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and was in theſe Arts ſo curious, that he made the Goddeſſe <hi>Venus</hi> in Alabaſter, and with a pencill did paint the wars of <hi>Carthage:</hi> and of ware did fourme the whole Iſland <hi>Creta.</hi> And albeit, that in theſe things he were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and expert, ioyntly therewith he was very ambitious: bycauſe he had as great enuie, and alſo rancour at an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, which was ſayde to paynt or worke more curiouſly then him ſelfe, as if the maintenance of his liuing had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted therein. There were in <hi>Rome</hi> two excellent men, the one named <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> the other <hi>Mileſius,</hi> men right famous in the liberall Arts: for that many in <hi>Rome</hi> did frequent their ſtudies, but muche more did peayſe their workes: <hi>Adrian</hi> did take thereof ſo great enuie, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he found no cauſe to kill them, he wanted not occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to baniſh them. A certaine ſkilfull carpenter in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plots for buildings, being in ſome queſtion with the Emperour <hi>Traiane,</hi> of the fourme and manner of placing of a ſtaire, <hi>Adrian</hi> being preſent, ſayd his iudgement ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what beſides y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purpoſe: whervnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> carpenter <hi>Polydorus</hi> anſwered: <hi>Maiſter Adrian, if your cunning did not ſerue you better to paint gourdes and coocumers, then to place ſtaires, you ſhuld obteine a ſmal credite amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt painters, as you haue amongſt artificers.</hi>
                  </q>
Although <hi>Adrian</hi> could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble thoſe words, he might not in any wiſe forget them: for after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of <hi>Traiane,</hi> he attaining the empire, thoſe iniurious words were no more coſtly vnto the ſorrowfull <hi>Polydorus,</hi> but to ſerue <hi>Adrian</hi> for ſufficient reuenge, to take away his life. <hi>Adrian</hi> being ſo great a Grecian, and alſo a Latiniſt, compounded certaine workes in Heroicall metre, as alſo in preaſe, &amp; did muche delight to haue them praiſed, &amp; could not indure but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſome muſt read them.

of <hi>Homer</hi> in great eſtimation: whereof <hi>Adrian</hi> did take ſo great enuie, that he gaue ſtreight commaundement, that none ſhoulde reade <hi>Homer,</hi> eyther openly or ſecretly, but the workes of <hi>Anthimachus,</hi> who was a Philoſopher moſt obſcure. <hi>Adrian</hi> had condition curiouſly to inquire, of common and ſmall matters: whereof he was both no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and murmured: bicauſe, <hi>Princes being giuen to make ſearch of trifling cauſes, proue variable in prouiding for matters of importance.</hi> Alſo <hi>Adrian</hi> was of fickle diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for that at the ſouden, he woulde determine, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme ſome enterpriſe, and after growe colde, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent omit the ſame: of this, as of the reſt, with great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he was noted and accuſed: bycauſe <hi>graue Princes ought to haue a repoſed deliberation, and a diligent exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. Adrian</hi> was in two things moſt extreme: that is to ſay, he vſed no meaſure or weight in his loue, or hatred: for vnto whom he did loue, he gaue all his heart: and where he did abhorre, he did imploy all his ſtrength. Admitting that this manner of loue, or hatred, is tollerable in others, yet moſt truely of vertuous Princes not permitted: by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if they be vnbridled in loue, in others which they loue not, they cauſe enuie: and if they be abſolute in hatred, they ſéeke vnto them ſelues great infamie: wherefore <hi>it is conuenient in loue, to be diſcrete, and in hatred, proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and aduiſed,</hi> He was likewiſe moſt extreme, that if he praiſed any thing, he did aduaunce it to the cloudes: and if it fell not into his fauour, he diſpraiſed it to the dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt bottome: in ſuch manner, that all ſayd of <hi>Adrian,</hi> that in praiſing, he was verie gracious, and in nippes, tauntes, and gyrdes, not a little malicious. <hi>Adrian</hi> had great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in faire women, who was ſo abſolute and alſo ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in that vice, that he did not onely inioy virgins, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade married women, but alſo in the houſes of his verie friendes, he had his ſecrete loues. Of the one part, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his iniuſtice, and of the other parte, the great iuſtice that he did execute: the hiſtoriographers would not place him amongeſt the pitifull Princes: neither condemne him

               <p>
                  <hi>ADrian</hi> being of the age of ninetene yeres, <hi>Traiane</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the abilitie and towardneſſe of the yong man, as well in letters as in armes, ſent to <hi>Spaine</hi> for him to come to <hi>Rome,</hi> with whome he did ſo behaue himſelfe, that for entertainment, he did receiue him into his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and in his loue, did place him as a childe. The naturall bountie, and great abilitie of <hi>Adrian</hi> being in apparance, <hi>Traiane</hi> from thence foorth did ſo regard and fixe his eyes, as well to honour him, all the dayes of his life: as alſo to leaue him Emperour, after his death. <hi>Adrian</hi> being in ſo great fauour with the Emperour <hi>Traiane,</hi> there folowed thereof in proceſſe of time, no ſmall diſpleaſures to his perſon, and perils vnto his life: for his enimies by enuie, with the Emperour procured his diſgrace, and with their malice, did maligne him with the people. <hi>It is an aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent peſtilence in the courtes of Princes, that the Prince being pleaſed to beare affection, or to honour any perſon, forthwith they ioyne to murmur, &amp; procure to perſecute the ſame.</hi> As <hi>Seuerianus</hi> being huſband vnto a ſiſter of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian,</hi> did murmur of him vnto <hi>Traiane,</hi> ſaying y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was a wonder vnto all men in <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſée <hi>Adrian</hi> to priuate, &amp; ſo far in fauour, &amp; that they preſumed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> after his dayes, he ſhould leaue him the Empire: vnto whome <hi>Traiane</hi> made anſwere: Who hath to ſuccéede me in the Empire? only the Gods be acquainted therewith: but admitting, that it were my will, and the Goddes permitting, that <hi>Adrian</hi> ſhoulde ſuccéede me in the Empire: I can ſay vnto thée, that to gouerne the ſame he will proue no foole, neyther a cowarde to defende it. The anſwere that <hi>Traiane</hi> made,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3692:44"/>
was very good, and yet not without a ſecret taunt, for that the Conſul <hi>Seuerianus,</hi> had neyther praiſed him for vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt, eyther held him for wiſe. This <hi>Seuerianus</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies a great enimie of <hi>Adrian,</hi> &amp; did not ceaſe trauelling to diſgrace him with the Emperour: wherby <hi>Adrian</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at times, to be both in fauour, and diſfauour: in ſuche manner, that <hi>Adrian</hi> burned betwixt two fiers, whiche is to wit, eare to reſiſt his enimies, and ſolicitude in conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his frends. The firſt office that <hi>Adrian</hi> had in <hi>Rome, Traiane</hi> being Conſul, and <hi>Domitian</hi> being emperour, he was made a <hi>Decem viriato:</hi> that is to ſay, he was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for one of the ten men, that were deputed, to determin contentions amongſt the people. <hi>Adrian</hi> gaue ſo good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his office, and recouered in <hi>Rome</hi> ſo good fame, that he ſéemed ſufficient vnto al men, alone and in his own perſon, to gouerne a common wealth: and ſo it came to paſſe, that in the yeare folowing, he was deputed Tribune of the ſecond legion: that is to ſay, that he had charge to gouerne and correct the ſeconde capteinſhip, of the armies
that were in the wars: <q>bycauſe it was a cuſtome in <hi>Rome,</hi> that euerie capteinſhip ſhould haue a capteine to fight: and a Tribune to rule and gouerne.</q>
The yeare of the tribune office being paſt, he was ſent vnto the inferiour <hi>Miſia,</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning that Prouince with ſo great prudence, and was of ſuche readineſſe and ſkill amongeſt thoſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> that ſome delighted to obey him, &amp; the others durſt not reſiſt him. <hi>Adrian</hi> was in no ſmall perplexitie, for the doubt he had to be remoued from <hi>Traianes</hi> fauour, which he ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to ſée him ſelfe in <hi>Miſia,</hi> &amp; his enimie <hi>Seuerianus</hi> with <hi>Traiane</hi> in <hi>Rome:</hi> that vppon any report that might be made of him there, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> malice of his enimie had place to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauate, and he for him ſelfe being farre diſtant, not able to anſwere. <hi>Traiane</hi> had in his chamber one whome he much fauoured, named <hi>Gallus,</hi> a moſt ſpeciall friend vnto <hi>Adrian:</hi> and <hi>Adrian</hi> being aduertiſed, that <hi>Gallus</hi> his moſt faithfull friende was deade, made for him great obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies, and wept for him many teares. There ſuccéeded in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3692:44"/>
fauour vnto this <hi>Gallus</hi> another named <hi>Surus,</hi> a man ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently wiſe and prudent: and alſo this, as <hi>Gallus,</hi> was moſt ſpecial friend vnto <hi>Adrian:</hi> and the very cauſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he obteined the fauoured to be his friends, was: for that in his giftes he was very liberall: and to doe for his friend, no leſſe determined.
<q>Alſo <hi>Adrian</hi> gaue him ſelf to content, ſerue, and pleaſe <hi>Plotina, Traianes</hi> wife, and vſed therein ſo great ſkill, and came ſo farre into fauour with <hi>Plotina,</hi> that out of that ſo narrowe friendſhip, he gathered more profit, then ſhe did honour. <hi>Traiane</hi> had in his houſe a néece named <hi>Sabina,</hi> whiche was to marrie, and requeſted for wife, of many noble <hi>Romaines:</hi> but <hi>Plotina</hi> and <hi>Surus</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled and perſuaded <hi>Traiane</hi> to marrie her vnto <hi>Adrian:</hi> affirming that with this marriage, he was excuſed of two marriages, that is to ſay: to ſéeke a wife for <hi>Adrian,</hi> and an huſband for <hi>Sabina.</hi>
                  </q>
When as <hi>Adrian</hi> had preſented many giftes, and offered many ſeruices vnto <hi>Plotina:</hi> partely for the great loue that ſhe did beare him, and for that ſhe had married him vnto <hi>Sabina,</hi> ſhe made him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: <hi>Adrian,</hi> according to the good will which I beare thée, it is ſmal which I haue done for thée, in reſpect of that which I meane to doe: for that I may doe little with my Lord <hi>Traiane,</hi> but as he hath choſen thée to be his nephew, he ſhall alſo adopt thée to be his ſonne. After <hi>Adrian</hi> had obteined <hi>Plotina</hi> for his good Ladie, <hi>Sabina</hi> for his wife, and <hi>Surus</hi> for his friend, he little eſtéemed the enimitie of <hi>Seuerianus</hi> his enimie: bycauſe in <hi>Traianes</hi> houſe, all did honour him as one in fauour, &amp; did ſerue him as a maiſter.</p>

               <p>BY the marriage that <hi>Adrian</hi> had with <hi>Sabina,</hi> néece vnto the Emperour <hi>Traiane,</hi> there followed him, not a litle, but very much profite: for, beſides that he was moſt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3692:45"/>
in fauour with the Emperour, and verie well liked of the Empreſſe <hi>Plotina,</hi> the greateſt parte of the affaires of the Empire, was diſpatcht by his handes. <hi>Adrian</hi> preſuming of great eloquence, preſented vppon a day before the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, a certaine paſtorall enterlude, whereat the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours and Oratours did greatly laugh: not onely of that whiche he ſayde, but alſo of the baſe ſtyle wherein he did
ſpeake the ſame. <q>He gaue him ſelfe to the Latine toung, and to the Art of an Oratour, wherin he grew ſo profound, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they gaue to him as great glory for his ſpeache, as vnto <hi>Cicero</hi> for his writing.</q>
In the firſt warres that <hi>Traiane</hi> had with the <hi>Datians, Adrian</hi> was made Queſtor, that is to ſay, he had charge to prouide, victuals and furniture for the campe: whiche was an office amongeſt the armies, of great honour, and of much confidence: for he had both the treaſure in his cuſtodie, and the payment of the campe. When <hi>Traiane</hi> was eyther ſicke, or not at leaſure, on his behalfe <hi>Adrian</hi> went to the Senate: but the Senators although they did admit him to ſpeake, they did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him to excéede or to take the chiefe place: <q>for it was a lawe amongeſt them much vſed, that being aſſembled in the Senate, none ſhould preſume to clap his handes, to cauſe ſilence, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the doore to be ſhut, neyther enter being clad with a long gowne, or to place him ſelfe in the higheſt ſeate, but onely the Emperour.</q>
Being notorious vnto all men, that <hi>Adrian</hi> was priuate with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Traiane,</hi> and in great fauour with <hi>Plotina</hi> his wife, and therewithall, that he was a man both prudent and politique: and although in the Senate not permitted to the chiefeſt place, yet all things were directed by his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, in ſuche wiſe, that at home all things were done as he thought good, and abroade as he did commaund. When it was knowne in <hi>Rome,</hi> that the king of <hi>Datia</hi> eftſoones had rebelled, <hi>Adrian</hi> preſently perſuaded <hi>Traiane,</hi> in his owne perſon to go to that war, and to leaue the enterpriſe to no other man: wherein <hi>Adrian</hi> did followe and ſerue <hi>Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane,</hi> more then any other capteine: and certainly did there
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3692:45"/>
ſo valiaunt and notable déedes, that with <hi>Traiane</hi> he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined fauour, and aduaunced his perſon to great eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Adrian</hi> being thus notified in the warres of <hi>Datia, Traiane</hi> thought it méete to commende vnto him the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde legion, which was vnder the protection of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe <hi>Minerua:</hi> and in ſuch manner did gouerne the ſame, and gaue his ſouldiers ſo great courage, that he was the man, that did moſt grieue the enimie, and leaſt did feare perilles.
<q>The thing moſte eſtéemed of the Emperour <hi>Traiane,</hi> was a Diamond which <hi>Nerua</hi> had giuen him: this Diamond <hi>Traiane</hi> gaue <hi>Adrian,</hi> in the time of the warres of <hi>Datia,</hi> which was ſo kept and eſtéemed of <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> that vntill the day of his death, it was neuer ſéene off from his finger.</q>
The warres of <hi>Datia</hi> being finiſhed, <hi>Traiane</hi> returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> leauing <hi>Adrian</hi> as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of that Prouince, <hi>Suſſurus</hi> and <hi>Seuerianus</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls. He had not long gouerned <hi>Datia,</hi> when <hi>Adrian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from the Senate newe prouiſion to paſſe into <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia:</hi> where he was not only gouernour in cauſes of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, but alſo had charge of all martiall affaires: bycauſe certaine barbarous <hi>Danubians</hi> had entered thoſe Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſacking and ſpoyling greate countries. <hi>Adrian</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arriued into <hi>Panonia,</hi> did in ſhort time expell the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, viſited the countries, refourmed the armies, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticed the <hi>Romaine</hi> officers: and founde by infourmation, that they were great friendes of idleneſſe, and no eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of robberie.

               <p>IN all Kingdomes and Prouinces, where <hi>Adrian</hi> was eyther Pretour or Queſtour, preſently he made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent inquiſition, if there were any Magicians of Sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers: and if he founde any he did perſuade them, with ſwéete wordes, and riche rewardes, to be certified, if after the death of <hi>Traiane,</hi> the Empire ſhould come vnto his handes: for that he was not onely deſirous to obteine the ſame, but carefull to know the iſſue thereof. Being reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the Prouince of <hi>Meſia,</hi> he was aduertiſed by a Mathematike, that he ſhould be Emperour: and demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding howe and by what meanes, he vnderſtoode thereof, anſwered: by a certaine friend which was not onely lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the naturall courſes, but alſo did vnderſtande the ſecretes of the immortall Gods. Although <hi>Adrian</hi> was reſident in ſtraunge Prouinces, he was not ſlacke to ſerue the Empreſſe <hi>Plotina,</hi> and to pleaſe the chamberleine <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus:</hi> in ſuch wiſe, that if his enimies did thinke him farre off, they found his ſeruice, alwayes ready and at hande. Nowe when <hi>Traiane</hi> was ſtricken in age, and become ſickly, <hi>Adrian</hi> continued no leſſe diligent, to ſolicite <hi>Ploti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> and <hi>Surus,</hi> to perſuade the Emperour, to adopt him for his ſonne: but on the other ſide the Conſul <hi>Seuerianus, Palma</hi> and <hi>Celſus,</hi> and other his enimies, did withſtande: whoſe diligence and malice did little profite, bycauſe they did but diſcouer their intent, and coulde not obteine their deſire. Eyther by the onely will of <hi>Traiane,</hi> or by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of <hi>Plotina,</hi> nor by the ſuite of <hi>Surus,</hi> eyther by the merite of his owne perſon, the Emperour <hi>Traiane</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to thoſe <hi>Elius Adrian</hi> to be his ſonne, after his dayes to ſuccéede him in the Empire: for the Emperour had many kingdomes to giue, but no ſonne to whome he might leaue the ſame.</p>
               <p>Before <hi>Traiane</hi> had elected <hi>Adrian,</hi> he was long deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, to make no aſſignment of any perſon, to ſuccéed him
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3692:46"/>

To the ende that after his dayes, the Senate might open and reade the ſame, and from thence to make election: not of him that did moſt procure, but that did beſt deſerue. At one time a certaine Conſul, named <hi>Neratius Priſcus,</hi> was greatly in his fauour, vnto whom he had thought to haue left y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, in ſo much, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one day <hi>Traiane</hi> ſaid vnto him: <hi>Neratius Priſcus,</hi> from hencefoorth I comend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empire vnto thée, if any ſorrowfull or ſouden deſtinie ſhall happen vnto me. All ſuch as did withſtande the adoption of <hi>Adrian,</hi> did fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour the election of <hi>Neratius Priſcus:</hi> but Fortune that ſhould haue framed the effect, brought <hi>Neratius</hi> into <hi>Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes</hi> great hatred, not a little to the profite of <hi>Adrian:</hi> by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe from thence foorth, although their remained enimies to hinder his intent, none as an oppoſite, durſt demaunde the ſame. When <hi>Traiane</hi> paſſed from <hi>Spaine</hi> into <hi>Aſia,</hi> to the wars of the <hi>Parthians, Plotina</hi> and <hi>Surus,</hi> made great ſuite that <hi>Adrian</hi> might be ſente, as Pretour into <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria:</hi> whoe being in <hi>Antioche,</hi> was aduertiſed by a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinger from <hi>Traiane,</hi> which in times paſt had bene his tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, how he was elected to be <hi>Traianes</hi> ſonne, and aſſigned his ſucceſſour in the Empire.

                  <hi>Tutinus</hi> a noble knight of <hi>Rome, Adrian</hi> did create Senatour, and gaue him the enſignes of Conſul, whereat the whole Senate was offended: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, that the Emperour ought or might not create in ſuch manner: partely, becauſe <hi>Tutinus</hi> was not of deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and partly, for that the aduiſe of the Senate ſhould haue béene vſed therein. <hi>Adrian</hi> was diſpleaſed with theſe wordes of the <hi>Romaines,</hi> and from thence foorth did vſe more libertie in reparting offices, and leſſe companye in determining cauſes. He helde <hi>Seuerianus</hi> in greate ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, which had married his ſiſter, vnto whome he gaue both honour and great rewardes: and at all times, when <hi>Seuerianus</hi> came vnto his chamber to conferre, and to vnderſtand his pleaſure, <hi>Adrian</hi> came foorth to méete and receiue him at the doore.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3692:51"/>
and honour, and <hi>Adrian</hi> with no leſſe facilitie did take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his life.

Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally he was giuen to haue compaſſion of the ſicke, and herein he did neither conſider whether they were friends or foes: for that indifferently he did viſite them, and at his owne charges did prouide for them. He did not onely viſite the ſicke, but alſo the olde men, decrepite with age: of whome at large he woulde inquire of the yeres that they had liued, the kingdomes they had trauelled, the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers they had paſſed, the enimies which they had helde, &amp; the neceſſities that they had endured, in ſuche wiſe, that many times, of the things which they had ſaide, of times paſt, he tooke example for the time preſent. <hi>Adrian</hi> was a moſt ſingular friende of vertuous men, and wiſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and neuer wanted their companie, either in warre or peace: becauſe <hi>of the vertuous he learned how to liue, and of the Philoſophers howe to gouerne.</hi>

               <p>WHen <hi>Adrian</hi> parted from <hi>Almaine</hi> to come to <hi>Rome,</hi> not as then determined to haue ſtayed long there: but the occaſion of his ſtaye, was, for that the good <hi>Traiane,</hi> in his latter yeres, was deteined ſo long time in the warres of <hi>Aſia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Europa,</hi> that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealthes of <hi>Italie</hi> were growen to greate and ouermuch libertie. <hi>Adrian</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from <hi>Rome,</hi> came ſtreight vnto <hi>Gallia Tranſalpina:</hi> not to conquer but to viſite the ſame. The frenchemen did much reioyce at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, and in euery prouince did him great ſeruice, becauſe <hi>Adrian</hi> was the firſt <hi>Romaine</hi> Prince that euer entred <hi>Fraunce</hi> in peace, for that all his predeceſſours brake in by violent hoſtilitie. Perſonally viſiting all <hi>Gallia,</hi> wherein he did erect newe buildinges, repaired the olde, reedified temples, reformed prieſtes, ſet at libertie certeine gentlemen, gaue giftes vnto the people, pardoned ſome offences, and puniſhed others: fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally all his déedes, were gratefull vnto the citizens, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable vnto the common wealth. The affaires of <hi>Fraunce</hi> being ſet in order, once more he returned to paſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Alps,</hi> and tooke his way into <hi>Almaine,</hi> without any diſpoſition to make warre, but to procure peace: for that <hi>Adrian</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally was giuen friendly with all men to haue peace, whiche if they would not accept, he was not after eaſie to intreate.</p>
               <p>In the time that <hi>Adrian</hi> had moſt peace, then did he exerciſe his men of warre, as if he had béene amongeſt his enimies: and for this cauſe he helde opinion, that al Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces did craue his peace, for that he was neuer vnreadie to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:3692:52"/>
make warre. <hi>Adrian</hi> inuented many deuiſes, wherin his knightes might exerciſe their ſtrength, as wagers to runne, towers, and fortes of wood, and earth, to aſſault, marche tenne againſt tenne in combat: he ſought out ſtrong places to practiſe the arte of mining, prouoked them to go to wraſtling, and brought them to riuers to learne to ſwim: finally, he held them ſo occupied, that they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red rather to fight an whole day in earneſt, then ſo many dayes in ieſt. Alſo <hi>Adrian</hi> did vſe to féede of the common victuals of the camp, that is to ſaye, groſe baken, rat eaten chéeſe, powdred béefe, and barley bread: and if any thinge were dreſt for his owne perſon, more delicate then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt, he made ſuche diuiſion, that the leaſt parte came to him ſelfe. What more or leſſe, he alwayes did weare ſome armour: and if by chaunce he found any gentleman vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, preſently he was checked of his wages: affirming, <hi>that the man that goeth vnarmed, ought not to be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and honoured as a gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> In the armies, amongſt the greater or leſſe, better or woorſe, their worke or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe was equally diuided: whiche is to wéete, when the time was to drawe, all did hale and drawe: and when the time was to dig, all without exception at their turne, did dig and mine: at the time of watching in their courſe, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man did watche: in theſe trauels he did no more excuſe him ſelfe then others: for at his turne, he did both watche and dig in the mine with his owne handes. He had not, neither conſented in the warres, the vſe of high tables to féede on, either portals to paſſe the time, neither canes to coole or recreate, either warmed water to bathe, neither cookerie or dreſſing of meate, either ſelling of ſwéete oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: for he helde opinion, that the good and valiant ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, did not annoynt them ſelues, but with the blood of enimies. <hi>Adrians</hi> garments were not curious or coſtlye, but very cleanly, whereunto he was addicted, both in diet, and apparell: and after a maner he did abhorre ſuche men as were not nete and fine: affirming, that filthie men be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes of drouſie iudgements.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:3692:53"/>In the warres he did neuer weare ſilk, purple, or riche veſture, either buttons, or agglets of golde, or his dagger, ſwoorde, or armour gilte: but notwithſtanding verye fine and ſtrong. When any was notified in the warres, of valiant and doubtie déedes, preſently he did notifie him, with great and bountifull rewardes: in ſuch manner, that he did not deferre to recompence at <hi>Rome</hi> any ſeruice don in the warres. When he trauailed through mountaines, moſt times he did alight to bring other men on foote, and did marche xv. or xx. miles in his armour: and this he did, to kéepe their horſes freſhe and luſty, if they ſhould hap to encounter with the enimie. He did alwayes lodg with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the campe, and ordinarily he went from tent to tent, to viſite the wounded, and with the whole and ſound to haue conuerſation. <hi>Adrian</hi> was ſo familiar with his men of warre, that he called verie many by their names, and knew all men by their geſture: in ſuch wiſe, that no eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie or ſtraunger, might enter his campe that to him was vnknowen. When a horſemans rome was vacant in the warres, the captaines ſought out ſuch as ſhould ſuccéede: but <hi>Adrian</hi> in his owne perſon would examine him, and this he did, to knowe his face, and try his ſtrength. Such as he did elect tribunes, or captaines of his armies, were verie valiant, but not couetous: and ioyntly therewith, he admitted not young men without beardes, either olde men broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or decayed: doubting, in too much youth, want of gouernement: and in too much age, ſtrength to fight. He made good paye vnto his men of warre, ſtreightly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding his captaines to imbezill any wages, or to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye preſent giuing vnto the ſouldiers: and this <hi>Adrian</hi> did, to auoide neceſſitie in the one, and couetiſe in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He did prohibite by a publique lawe, that none ſhould carrie vnto the warres any ſuperfluous thing, and that none ſhould preſume to buy or ſell any thing that was not neceſſarie. Very diligent to furniſhe his camps with victuals, which being brought vnto the campe, he did ſo priſe them, that the buyer was not robbed, either the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3692:53"/>
ſeller defrauded. Imitating <hi>Vegetius, Adrian</hi> did write a booke, wherein he did inſtruct the captaines, howe they ſhould fight: and an order, how tribunes ſhoulde gouerne the armies: to conformitie whereof he made many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent lawes, which for long time were obſerued of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi> Princes. In this caſe, of order, prouiſion, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the men of warre, they were onely thrée Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that attained vnto the chiefe perfection thereof: that is to ſaye, <hi>Auguſtus, Traiane,</hi> and <hi>Adrian,</hi> becauſe all other Princes, helde men of warre not to defend, but to diſſipate the common wealth.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>ALl the time that <hi>Adrian</hi> was in <hi>Almaine,</hi> he did moſte occupie him ſelfe in reforming his men of warre into good cuſtomes and order, which he did not without greate prudence, after the manner of a good mariner, whiche in time, when the Sea is calme, doeth dreſſe and mende his failes, &amp; order his anchors againſt the ſtorme and ſoudein chaunces that may followe in time to come.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>Almaine, Adrian</hi> came vnto greate <hi>Britaine,</hi> whiche is nowe called <hi>England,</hi> and there founde peace, as in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> which was then holden for a greate mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile: becauſe from the time of <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> whiche did firſt conquer the ſame, vnto the dayes of <hi>Adrian,</hi> they were neuer without warres with the Frenche men, or rebelling againſt the <hi>Romaines.</hi>
                  <q>Preſently vppon his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie into <hi>Britaine,</hi> he ſought curiouſly to be informed of the lawes they helde, and of the cuſtomes they vſed: which being peruſed and examined, ſome he did allowe, and ſome he did remoue and make fruſtrate: eſpecially, he did adni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate that lawe, whereby the man ſhould holde ii. wiues, and the woman .vii. huſbandes. When <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> did
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3692:54"/>
conquer the Ilande of England, he brought many people out of <hi>Italie</hi> to inhabite that countrie: and although the natiue, with the ſtraunger, helde no warre, yet liued they not in perfect peace: for the <hi>Britans</hi> did terme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

                  <hi>Adrian</hi> finding that no friendſhip might be framed by prayer, or amendment by correction, deuiſed to diuide the kingdome in the middeſt: and the caſe was thus: that in the middes of the kingdome, he made a wall from Sea to Sea, a worke moſt ſtraunge, wherein this Prince did imploy great treaſure. <hi>Adrian</hi> being reſident in <hi>Britaine,</hi> was aduertiſed from <hi>Rome</hi> of the want of good gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was vſed in his wiues houſe, by the occaſion of certeine <hi>Romaines,</hi> which aduentured to accompany the Empreſſe: whoſe conuerſation was more to the preiudice of his fame, then to the profite of his ſeruice. <hi>Septicius Prefectus,</hi> and <hi>Sortonius Tranquillus,</hi> which at that time were Secretaries vnto the Senate: theſe &amp; others grewe very familiar with the Empreſſe <hi>Sabina:</hi> whome <hi>Adrian</hi> ſent commaundement to be depriued of their offices, and to be baniſhed <hi>Rome, Sabina, Adrians</hi> wife, was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to be franke of ſpeache, and of life ſomewhat licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. <hi>Adrian</hi> did greatly abhorre to haue <hi>Sabina</hi> vnto his wife: and would ſaye, not in ſecrete, but openly, that if he were a common perſon, he would haue béene diuorced, for that in her conuerſation ſhée was preſumptuous, &amp; in life
looſe &amp; diſſolute. <q>
                     <hi>Adrian</hi> was much inclined to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, not onely the conditions &amp; inclinations of his frinds but alſo of the manner which they vſed to liue in their houſes: for the vnderſtanding wherof, he woulde inquire of the ſeruaunts, ſlaues and labourers that brought them victuals, what they did eate, and what they did drinke, &amp; what their maiſters ſpent in their houſes.</q>
                  <hi>Sabina</hi> wife vnto <hi>Adrian,</hi> did write a certeine letter vnto a <hi>Romaine</hi> gentleman, complaining that he would not come to viſite her, through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pleaſures of <hi>Britaine,</hi> &amp; newe loues in that countrey y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had taken in hand, which letter happening by chaunce into the handes of <hi>Adrian,</hi> &amp; the knight vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

great magnificence and liberalitie: for that naturally, in receiuing he was a niggard: but in giuing very bountifull. There was not euer any thing demaunded, that he gaue not: if it were not preuented by ſome others ſuite, which alwayes he did recomfort with hope for time to come.
<q>The rewardes of his nobleneſſe, was the gift of townes, cities, caſtles, Prouinces, kingdomes, mountaines, riuers, flockes or heardes, ſalt mariſhes, milles, offices: and not onely ſuch as hapned in the gouernement of the common wealth: but alſo he gaue the horſſes out of his ſtable, the garments for his perſon, the prouiſion for his diſpences, and the money for his chamber: in ſuch wiſe, that to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer others from neceſſitie, he brought him ſelfe in to want of prouiſion.</q>
                  <hi>Adrian</hi> in his life was noted of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers weakneſſes and defections, which were both colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and couered, with his large and bountifull giftes.

His cuſtome was, when he ſent for any to ſerue him in the warres, to giue him al things neceſſarie for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, that is to ſay, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to fight, &amp; money to ſpend. <hi>Adrian</hi> being aduertiſed of a noble gentleman of <hi>Numidia,</hi> named <hi>Malacon,</hi> a man both valiant &amp; warlike: who refuſing to receiue the vſuall rewarde that <hi>Adrian</hi> gaue vnto ſuche as did accompanie him in warres, ſayde vnto him: It is more reaſon that I ſhould preuent thée, in doing mine office, then thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt precede mée in doing thy dutie: which is to ſay, that before thou beginne to fight, I ſhoulde beginne to gratifie thée: for in the end, it is much more that thou doeſt for me, in aduenturing thy life, then I in rewarding thée with my goods. Many times <hi>Adrian</hi> would boaſt him ſelfe, that he coulde neuer remember that he had eaten alone, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes did eate in the companie of Philoſophers that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in Philoſophie: eyther elſe of capteines, that did talke and conferre in matters of warre.</p>

                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:3692:57"/>He was neate in his apparell, curious and delicate in his diet.
<q>Examining the order of the diet of his houſholde, and finding the prouiſion prouided for the honour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to be imbeziled and purloyned by officers, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded them to be whipt, and turned out of his gates: for notwithſtanding, he had a noble mynde, to giue a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince for a reward, he had not patience to ſuffer or endure, the deceit or ſtealth of a pennie. <hi>Adrian</hi> was a man both ſeuere, gladſome, graue, courteous, pleaſant, ſuffering, raſhe, patient, furious, a ſauer, liberall, a diſſembler, piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, &amp; cruell: finally, he was variable in his vices, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant in vertues: bycauſe he did not long abſteine from euill, eyther long continue in doing good.</q>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Adrian</hi> vnto his friendes, was bothe gratefull and vnkinde: that is to ſay, he gaue them much goods, and did not much eſtéeme their honour. Great inconuenience did followe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Adrian,</hi> for his infidelitie and want of faith vnto his friendes: which did moſt clearely ſhewe it ſelfe in <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus, Nietus, Seuerus,</hi> and <hi>Septitius:</hi> whom at one time he helde for friends, &amp; after did perſecute them as enimies. <hi>Eudemius</hi> a noble Gentleman of <hi>Rome,</hi> he was ſo great a frend with <hi>Adrian,</hi> that he offered ſacrifices vnto the gods to giue him the Empire: and after <hi>Adrian</hi> did beare him ſo great hatred, that he did perſecute him, not onely to caſt him out of <hi>Rome,</hi> but alſo vntill he had brought him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme pouertie. <hi>Polenus</hi> and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> were of <hi>Adrian</hi> ſo euil handled and perſecuted, that they choſe rather to dye with their owne handes: then to liue vnder his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement. <hi>Eliodorus,</hi> a moſt famous man in letters, both Gréeke and Latine, was not onely of <hi>Adrian</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, but alſo put to death, and torne in pieces: whoſe death was much be wailed for that he was profitable vnto the whole comon wealth. <hi>Oluidius, Quadratus, Catalius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Turbon,</hi> auncient Conſuls, were by <hi>Adrian</hi> perſecuted, although not put to death, bycauſe euery one ſéeking to ſaue his life, were baniſhed <hi>Rome</hi> and all <hi>Italie.</hi> The no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conſul <hi>Seuerianus,</hi> huſbande vnto <hi>Sabina,</hi> ſiſter vnto

In all things <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> was very wel learned: that is to ſay, reading, writing, ſinging, painting, fighting, hunting, playing, and diſputing: but that he had therewith a tache or a fault: which was, that if he knewe muche, he preſumed much, wherein he was noted of all men, bycauſe he ſcorned all men. After he entered into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he gaue him ſelfe vnto Aſtrologie: and held for cuſtome yearely to write out of that ſcience, of al things that ſhould happen that yeare: which alſo he did in the yeare that he dyed, but obteined not the knowledge thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adrian</hi> in one thing did ſéeme to excell, in that he neuer deſired the knowledge of any facultie, art, or ſcience: but that he procured to be ſingular. He ouercame many warres with armes, but he did appeaſe and cut off many more with giftes: bicauſe vnto diuers peoples, cities, and townes, he gaue libertie and priuileges, and to his Lords and viceroyes, he gaue great rewardes. Although in ſome particular things, touching both friendes and enimies, he ſhewed him ſelfe both affectionate, and alſo paſſionate: vniuerſally, as touching the weale of the common welth, <hi>Adrian</hi> was alwayes friend in miniſtring iuſtice. When there happened any graue matters, at the ſouden, he wold furiouſly be altered: but at the time of iudgement and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſeriouſly he did both conſider &amp; examine them.

Naturally, he was of an vnquiet heart, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition intermedling.

that was poſſeſſed of any extremitie, or ſingularitie, that he could not come to the viewe thereof, with extreme deſire, he did many times growe both ſicke and ſorrowfull. Notwithſtanding he was large and of great magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with Philoſophers, with countries, with men of warre, and with his friends: much more was his magnificence to the miniſters of iuſtice: and being demaunded of <hi>Fauori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> why he was ſo bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiful vnto them, anſwered: <hi>I make the miniſters of iuſtice riche: bycauſe, by robberie of iuſtice, they ſhall not make other men poore.</hi>

                  <q>He did alſo ordeine, that when any man was condemned to dye for offences of great enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and his goodes confiſcate, that his children, ſhoulde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the tenth part of thoſe goodes: in ſuche wiſe, that for that, whiche was taken from them, they had to bewaile the offence of their fathers, and for that which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them, they ſhoulde féele, and alſo commende the cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of the Prince.</q>
               </p>

of the Prince: all whiche <hi>Adrian</hi> did remoue and adnihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late: affirming, that thoſe lawes, were but of ſmall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, to the behoofe of the Prince, and to the great offence of the common wealth. Alſo the <hi>Romaine</hi> Princes did vſe to inherite the goods of ſtraungers: wherin <hi>Adrian</hi> did ordeine, that the children, or the next of the kinne ſhoulde inioye the ſame. Alſo he ordeined, that what ſo euer he were, that founde hid treaſure, in his owne inheritaunce, ſhould inioy the whole: and if it were founde in an other mans inheritaunce, the owner thereof ſhould haue the one moitie: and if it were founde in publike or common place, that then it ſhould be equally parted with the Confiſcator. Alſo he ordeined, that no man what ſo euer, of his own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie ſhould kill his ſlaue, for any offence: but to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto the Iudge, deputed by the Prince. Alſo he made a lawe of refourmation, both for eating of ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meates, and alſo for wearing of garments, eyther too
many, or ouer coſtly. <q>Alſo he did ordeine, that none what ſo euer, ſhould goe or be carried in a litter: and one whiche he had, he commaunded for example, to be burnt, in the market place.</q>
He alſo commaunded that Conſuls, and Senatours, within the compaſſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould weare their gownes, whiche was a garment of peace. He alſo ordeined, that yong men that wanted their parentes, ſhuld haue tutors vnto the age of fiue and twentie yeares: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were married.

<q>Alſo he did ordeine, that men and women ſhoulde haue their ſeuerall bathes, and that who ſo euer ſhould enter into the forbidden place, to ſuffer death for the ſame.</q>
Alſo he did ordaine, that neyther for the Prince or Conſuls, any victuals ſhould be taken from any man: but that euery man might ſell to whome he would, where he would, and how he might. He did ordeine, that no woman ſhuld adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture to heale with words, eyther that any man ſhuld preſume to cure with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pound medicines: but to per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fourme all their cures, with ſimple hearbes.

From the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation he built a ſtately bridge, which was afterwards named <hi>Adrians</hi> bridge. He made alſo for him ſelfe a ſepulchre, ioyning vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> riuer <hi>Tyber,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtones whereof were brought from <hi>India,</hi> and the workemen out of <hi>Greece.</hi>
                  <q>He tranſlated the temple of <hi>the Goddeſſe of good Fortune,</hi> and the figure of <hi>Decian</hi> the artificer that was placed therein: that was of ſo great weight, that hardly foure &amp; twentie Eliphants might remoue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, the whiche figure was dedicated vnto the Sunne: <hi>Adrian</hi> did erect one other to be dedicated vnto the Moone,

of no leſſe weight or riches then the other: whereof the great <hi>Polydore</hi> was workman.</q>
He built in <hi>Rome</hi> a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine building, which many yeares after was named, <hi>the mole of Adrian:</hi> and at theſe dayes is called, <hi>the caſtle of of Saint Angelo.</hi> He remoued many riuers out of their chanels to water the fieldes, brought many fountaines, for prouiſion of cities.

<q>When a certeine cunning man made offer to be bound to place him téethe wherewith to ſpeake and eate: <hi>Antoninus</hi> made him aunſwere: <hi>Since neuer from my harte proceeded fained or double woords: there ſhall neuer enter into my mouth, counterfete teeth.</hi> The want of his téeth, made him to eat with paine, and ſtutter in his ſpéeche. Being touched with a Ieſter for his ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering, <hi>Antoninus</hi> aunſwered: <hi>I recke not greatly to ſtumble in wordes, ſo that I erre not, and ſtand vp right in deedes.</hi> In <hi>Rome</hi> there was a Senatour named <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus,</hi> liberall in ſpéeche, and not ſober in diet, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing <hi>Antoninus</hi> for that his téeth failed him, bothe to eate and ſpeake, aunſwering, ſaide: I conſent to that which thou ſaieſt: for that I, if I woulde, may not be a glutton: but thou maiſt, and wilt not leaue to be malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Many Princes did excell <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> in ſcience, but none did matche him in eloquence: for that ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he did talke in the Latine tounge, &amp; did diſpute in the <hi>Greeke.</hi>
                  </q>
He was naturally very well conditioned, which had in him moſte apparance, for that alwayes his woords
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:3692:66"/>
were without malice, and his thoughtes without ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. Although he were of complexion cholerike ſanguine which giueth men occaſion to be raſhe and ſoudein, it had no place in <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> for that he was conſtant in aduerſities, and patient in iniuries. When in his preſence they ſaide any woordes that did grieue or offende him, or brought him any ſorrowfull newes: in biting of his lipp, in caſting downe his eyes, and laying one hand vpon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, they vnderſtood his great ſorrow: but ioyntly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, he was neuer ſéene of any man, ſoudeinly to chaunge countenaunce, muche leſſe to ſpeake any cruell or iniurious woorde. Before he was Emperour, he was the welthieſt man of all the Empire: for that he did inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite from his foure graundfathers, greate and ample patrimonies: vnto whome he was ſole inheritour. He was giuen to gather, conſerue and augment his goodes, riches and wealth, but without all oppreſſion to any perſon, for that he liued onely of him ſelfe, defrauding no man of his ſuite. After he obteined the Empire, when by chaunce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny talke was moued of the couetouſneſſe of men, and of the neceſſitie of Princes, many times he woulde ſaye: <hi>I giue thankes to the immortall Gods, that ſince I haue beene Emperour, I haue not taken any thing from any man: either before, that euer I was benighted with debt.</hi>
                  <q>He had great affection to the woorkes of the fielde, and therein had not onely the tooles and thinges neceſſarie for the purpoſe: that is to ſaye, buffes, oxen, cartes, ploughes, but he him ſelf would be occupied in ſowing corne, cutting vines, pruning trées, and at times would take the plough, and make a dozen of furrowes.</q>
He was extreme in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that in, and for all thinges, he placed him ſelfe in the middeſt: which he did very well diſcouer in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of his perſon and eſtate: wherein, neither for his prodigall expence, he was noted proude: either for want of a noble minde, eſtéemed a niggard. Many times the Heauens being cleare, and a ſettled faire weather in apparance, he would ſaye: vppon ſuche a daye wee ſhall
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3692:66"/>
haue raine, or chaunge of weather, wherein he neuer er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and manye times did aduouche, that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof procéeded not of ſcience, either of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, but of certeine experiences, which he gathered, when he vſed the labour of the fielde.
<q>When on a certeine time, with his knife he was pruning of a plumb trée in his orcharde ioyning vnto the high way, a Senatour ſaide vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: ſince you are an Emperour, ceaſſe to vſe the office of a labourer, vnto whome <hi>Antoninus</hi> aunſwered: it is leſſe euil for an Emperour to prune trées in his orcharde, then to conſume loſt time in his palace. He was very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue to that which was ſaide, and curiouſly he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what others did: chiefely to the ende to attaine knowledge: for that naturally, he was ſharpe and of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate iudgement.</q>
He was alwayes occupied, either in reading, ſtudying, diſputing, or doing ſomethinge with his handes: and wherein he wanted ſkill, he diſdained not to craue to be taught. Alwayes for the more parte, he went bare headed, through much heate he had therein: and one aduiſing him, the ayre of <hi>Rome</hi> to be very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and therefore right neceſſarie to haue his head coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, aunſwered: aſſure mée from troubles of men on earth, and I am aſſured that nothing ſhall offende mée, which the Gods ſhal ſend mée from Heauen. He was of him ſelfe excellent in Muſike, delighted therein, and a greate friende to Muſicians. <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> was ſuche and ſo good, that all heartes did loue him, all toungs did praiſe him, and all ſuche as did not knowe him, but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte, had him in admiration: finally, he was compared vnto <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> becauſe in him there were not more vertues to be deſired, either one onely vice to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</p>

                  <hi>ANnius Verus,</hi> father of the firſt <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> and father in lawe vnto <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> became ſo olde, that he was not able to ſit on horſebacke, either to go on foote, but that he was led and ſtaide by the arme, to ſaye his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Senate: becauſe, <hi>from olde putrified men, ripe and found counſels do proceede. Antoninus Pius</hi> beeing the man that delighted to leade his old father, did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giue him way in foule places, but in going vp of ſtaires, did rather ſéeme to beare him, then leade him. <q>Paſſing on
a certeine day, and beholding an olde man named <hi>Iulianus</hi> led vnto priſon for debt, and vnderſtanding the cauſe, he preſently payed the ſame, and added a worke of more pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that payde not onely all his debtes, but gaue him alſo to ſuſteine him &amp; his houſe. For that a penall lawe, proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in that behalf, that by iuſtice or otherwiſe, none ſhuld ſhead bloud within the compaſſe of <hi>Rome:</hi>
                  </q>
for his cauſe at the gate <hi>Salaria,</hi> a place deputed for execution of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and maiſters alſo did there chaſtice their ſeruaunts: and thus it chaunced, that <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> paſſing that way, found there, many ſlaues bounde and beaten moſte cruelly: he conceiued ſo great pitie, to ſée them ſo beaten without pitie, that preſently he bought them all: and the ſame daye he bought them, the verie ſame daye he made
them frée. <q>From his youth it was his inclination to viſite the ſicke, and to accompany ſuche as were in ſorrowe, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, and out of comfort: wherein the good <hi>Antoninus</hi> did ſo muche vtter the griefe, that he had of their griefe, &amp; he ſo much ſorrowed of their ſorrowe, that no man did ſo ſenſibly féele his owne griefe, as he did bewaile the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of others.</q>

And being aduertiſed by his friendes, and his moſt ſpeciall and priuate ſeruaunts how euil it became him to wéepe with and like a woman, aunſwered: <hi>that ſorrowfull woman came to craue helpe and ſuccour for her ſonne: and for that I may not relieue her with ſome remedie, I did aſsiſt to bewaile her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The <hi>Romaines</hi> had a cuſtome, to leaue the dead bodies of men executed in the fieldes: but <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> was the firſt that gaue order for ſuch bodies to be buried: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming it ſufficient, to take from men their liues, and not to féede beaſtes with their carcaſes. From the time of the proude <hi>Tarquine,</hi> the <hi>Romaines</hi> held for cuſtome, to giue malefactours great tormentes: the good <hi>Antoninus</hi> did take away all tortures, wherwith the members of mans bodie was put in daunger: ſaying, that the torment was ſufficient that were to chaſtice, but not to diſmember. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batus, Dioſcorus, Lipolus, Macrinus, Fuluius, Torqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Eucenius, Bruſcos,</hi> and <hi>Emilius,</hi> whereof foure being Conſuls, thrée Iudges, and two Pretors, and baniſhed by <hi>Adrian, Antoninus</hi> gaue them all pardon: and for that many did miſlike this déede, affirming it to be done to the preiudice of the fame and memorie of <hi>Adrian,</hi> he aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: <hi>Adrian</hi> my Lorde did not erre in that which he then did: and I thinke I do not erre in that which I nowe doe: becauſe then, he did it to profite him ſelfe by his iuſtice, as I nowe doe to obteine aduauntage by clemencie.</q>
Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo euer he went, either in <hi>Rome</hi> or other places of <hi>Italie,</hi> wéekely he did viſite the priſoners, and the poore which he found there for debt, he commaunded the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours with his owne money to be payde: and after that he had thrée times paide for one man, and the fourth time
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:3692:68"/>
found in priſon for debt: he commaunded him to be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto his creditour for his ſlaue. A fewe dayes after this commaundement, his clemencie not able to endure ſo rigorous Iuſtice: notwithſtanding the ſentence was moſte iuſt, he prouided at his owne coſt once more to buy and to giue libertie vnto that poore man. As before reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when <hi>Adrian</hi> was ſicke, and ſo diſtempered with his infirmities, that ſome he commaunded to be taken, ſome baniſhed, and ſome put to death: but <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> being adopted <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and being inueſted with the whole gouernement, did neither arreſt, baniſhe, or kill them: but onely commaunded to abſent them ſelues, and not to appeare in his preſence. Amongeſt all the notable workes of pietie that <hi>Antoninus</hi> did perfourme, was, that <hi>Adrian</hi> ſtriuing and watching to kill him ſelfe, <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> did ouerwhatche to preſerue a liue: being moſte true according to ſenſualitie, he ſhoulde haue procured, and not haue giuen any impediment to haue finiſhed his life: ſince vnto him, bothe houſe, goods, and eſtate ſhoulde ſuccéede.</p>
               <p>The Senatours, &amp; many other magiſtrates of <hi>Rome,</hi> did attempt to adnihilate the lawes, and monumentes of <hi>Adrian:</hi> whiche <hi>Antoninus</hi> did moſt ſtiffely denye, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and repulſe: and in the ende not onely did cauſe all his actes to be ratified, confirmed, and allowed: but alſo did frame and bring to paſſe with the Senate, that <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> ſhould be accompted amongeſt the Gods. He built in the honour of <hi>Adrian</hi> a moſte ſolemne temple in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine place, named <hi>Puſoll,</hi> and did furniſhe the ſame with Prieſtes to ſerue him, and endued them with rents to find them, and were commonly named <hi>Adrians</hi> prieſts.

                           <p>Fathers conſcript, you ſee with greate certeintie, howe ſoudeinly and vnawares death hath aſſailed mee, and by howe ſmall occaſion I loſe my life. Let mee be an example vnto you, and all men,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:3692:69"/>
and holde it for moſt certeine, that that parte of life is moſt times in peril, where, of certeintie of life we had ſetled moſt affiance. Nature hath not graunted me to haue children of mine owne, but therefore I giue great thankes vnto the immortall Gods, becauſe in deliuering mee from children, they haue diſcharged mee of greate and many cares. There goeth muche difference betwixt the ingendering, or the electing of a ſonne: for the one proceedeth of neceſsitie, the other is elect at large, will, and libertie. The ſonnes that nature giueth vs, are many times lame, filthie, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo fooliſhe: but ſuch as wee adopt, wee elect them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſound and diſcrete: for that no man is ſo impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent which at the time of election, chooſeth not the beſt. In time paſt, I elected Lucius, ſufficiently kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen vnto you: but the deſtinies were ſo contrary vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that before he had power to commaunde in the ſtate of Rome, he was buried in his ſepulture: but now we haue elected Antoninus for your emperour, whoe wee promiſe you, ſhall proue milde, benigne, quiet, and mercifull: for that clemencie is as naturall vnto him, as it is vnto the Sunne to giue light by daye. He receiueth the Empire in a competent age, to the ende ye feare not, by his too muche youth, to committ ſome raſhe deede, either by too muche olde age, negligently to gouerne the common wealth. He hath beene bred and nouriſhed in our own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and therefore will obſerue the cuſtomes thereof. Alſo his life hath been trained vnder our own lawes, a ſufficient occaſion to auoide all ſearche of vnneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie lawes of ſtraunge countries, and this you haue to regarde, not as a matter of ſmall importance: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is not any thing that more doeth offende
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:3692:69"/>
the common wealth, then to infecte the ſame with ſtraunge and vnuſed cuſtomes. He knoweth what thing it is to go on warrefare, to gouerne armies, to ſuffer both paſsions and motions of people, to vſe clemencie with ſome, and to correct others: in ſuche wiſe, that in him is conteined greate ſufficience, for the gouernement of the common wealth, ſince in all thinges he hath experience. Ye knowe him, and he knoweth you, ye haue dealt with him, and he hath dealt with you: &amp; I hold of him ſuch opinion, that he will neither deſpiſe you, either forget you: in ſuch manner, that his obedience ſhalbe vnto mee, as vnto a father, and ſhal deale with you in loue, like a brother. And I woulde that all you which be here preſent, as alſo all other perſons in Rome, that vpon ſuch condition I tranſferre the Empire, that after his dayes he leaue the ſame vnto Marcus Aurelius his ſonne in lawe, and my ſeruaunt: and from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, I ſweare and proteſt, that theſe two elections ſhalbe acceptable vnto the Gods, and profitable vnto men. In credite, life, and ſcience, Marcus Aurelius doth exceede Antoninus: but that hitherto Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus hath had more experience: for which cauſe vnto him, the rather we haue commended the Empire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, for the generall gouernement of any eſtate or common wealth, one yeare of experience is more worth then ten yeres of ſcience. I haue beene weake, careleſſe and negligent, in many thinges of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, partely inforced therunto by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mine enimies, but for the recompence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I do leaue two ſuche Princes one after the other, to gouerne the Empire, which for their ſingularitie in ſcience and vertue, ſhall excell all that be paſt, and I

He was not inclined to beginne warres, either in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to proſecute the ſame: for he holde opinion, that the Prince with more ſounde counſell ſhoulde commend his warres vnto his Captaines, to the ende in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to gouerne the common wealth, then to goe to the warres him ſelfe, and leaue his common wealth vnto others.</p>

               <p>WHen <hi>Antoninus</hi> ſent any Pretor to gouerne any prouince, he was not ſatiſfied that he were wiſe, prudent, and valiaunt: but alſo without any infection of pride, or couetouſneſſe: for he helde opinion, that he may euill gouerne a common wealthe, that is a
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:3692:73"/>
ſubiect to pride or couetouſneſſe.
<q>Vnto Pretours, Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, and Queſtours, before he gaue them any gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any countrie, firſt, he cauſed them to giue an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentorie, of their owne proper goods: to the end that when their charge were finiſhed, the increaſe of their wealth might be conſidered: and ioyntly therewith he did both ſay and warne them, that he ſent them to miniſter iuſtice, and not by fraude to rob countries. In all thinges that <hi>Antoninus</hi> commaunded, prouided, and chaſtiſed, he was very pitifull: ſuch excepted, as did offend in the execution of iuſtice: with whom he was both rigorous &amp; extreme: in ſuch wiſe, that other offences, were they very great, he did pardon them: but as concerning iuſtice, the ſmalleſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence was grieuouſly puniſhed. On a time certaine officers of his treaſure, brought him a memoriall: wherein was conteined the manner and fourme, yearely to increaſe his rents, which being ſéene and read, in the backe thereof, he did write theſe wordes: the order and fourme that you haue to ſearche, ought not to be to the augmentation of my rents: but for the aduancement of my common welth: eyther to impoſe newe tributes, but to deuiſe with order, to auoyde exceſſiue expences: for if <hi>Romaine</hi> Princes vſe no rule to moderate their charges, eyther we ſhall loſe our ſelues, or rob our common wealthes. Amongeſt all the Princes paſt, onely <hi>Antoninus</hi> did neuer permit, the rents of his eſtate, eyther more or leſſe to be augmented: but rather did pardon many common wealthes, of their olde debts, and alſo relieued others of ſome newe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</q>
Preſents that were brought him, of ſiluer, golde, ſilke, purple, iuels, or other riche things, he woulde not receiue them, were it not of the kings that payde tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute vnto the Empire: for he helde opinion, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealthes, rather then him ſelfe, had néede thereof. The things that he vſed moſt commonly to receiue, were bookes to reade in, horſſes to runne, and fruite to féede on: which he forgate not, gratefully to recompence. In af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires he vſed great expedition, that is to ſay, that if he

once did vndertake any buſineſſe, he neuer withdrewe his
hand, vntill it were finiſhed. <q>Euery yeare he cauſed his houſe to be viſited, as concerning exceſſiue expences: if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action or briberie were committed by any of his houſhold, againſt ſtraungers: if they did ſerue, which receiued wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: if amongeſt them, there were any that were notably vicious: finally, all that whiche the viſitour for the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die hereof did ſet downe, preſently was perfourmed.</q>
For the time of <hi>Domitian,</hi> the Emperours officers had a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, to receiue many &amp; chargeable fées of al men, that by warrant of the Princes liberalitie receiued reliefe: which the Emperour <hi>Antoninus,</hi> as a vile cuſtome, did vtterly take away: affirming, that a gratious rewarde, ought <hi>gratis</hi> to be diſpatched. The pryde, the preſumption, the hautineſſe, and alſo the tediouſneſſe of the whole Empire, he brought, placed, and reſtored vnto the plat of great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie: in ſuche wiſe, that as eaſily they diſpatched af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, with the Emperour <hi>Antoninus,</hi> as with a citizen of <hi>Rome.</hi> A matter ſurely to be noted, to beholde the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the dayes of this good Prince, howe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the refourmation thereof was eſtabliſhed: for ſurely, whether their affaires, were eyther with the Prince, or with the Senate, <q>neyther did they beginne their ſuit with

Where he had placed any good and ſound Iudge in any common wealth: he did not onely permit him not to be remoued: but alſo with giftes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtes he did ſuſteine him. This good Prince made a law,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:3692:75"/>
that none ſhould preſume to ſue to the Prince or Senate, for the office of iuſtice: vppon paine to be baniſhed <hi>Rome.</hi> There was in <hi>Rome</hi> a Iudge, named <hi>Gaius Maximus,</hi> who in <hi>Rome</hi> continued a iudge twentie yeares: of whom <hi>Antoninus</hi> wold oft ſay, that he had neuer ſéene, heard, or read of a man more cleare of life, eyther right in iuſtice.

By chaunce on a certaine day, he founde an olde ſeruitour, whiche he had knowne long in the warres, rubbing and clawing him ſelfe againſt the pillers of the Churche: <hi>Adrian</hi> demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding why he did ſo rubbe him ſelfe, and weare out his clothes: the olde man made anſwere, I haue no garments to clothe my ſelfe, neyther any man giueth me to eate: yet if it may pleaſe thée, <hi>Adrian,</hi> I haue founde meane to rub my ſelfe. <hi>Adrian</hi> tooke great compaſſion of that whiche he did ſée, but much more of that which he heard: and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he commaunded goods to be giuen him, and ſlaues to ſerue him. And as enuie, is naturall vnto the poore, as pryde is common among the riche: The next day other two poore men came before <hi>Adrian,</hi> rubbing them ſelues amongſt the pillers, in hope to receiue the like liberalitie:

whom he willed to be called vnto him, commaunding the one to ſcratch the other, and by turne to eaſe each other of his itch.

               <p>MAny trauels and hard aduentures followed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Antoninus</hi> while he liued, and alſo in all his kingdomes, in the time of his reigne: bicauſe <hi>Fortune is ſo variable, that ſhe neuer ſtayeth her wheele, or euer ceaſeth to be turning thereof.</hi>
                  <q>In the ſecond yeare of his reigne, hunger was ſo great, ſo ſharpe, and ſo generall through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Italie,</hi> that thereof there dyed no leſſe, then if it had bene of a fierce peſtilence. There was in <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſo cruell, and ſo generall an earthquake, that many houſes and buildings were ſubuerted, many people ſlayne, and not a fewe cities diſinhabited: for the repayring of which great hurtes, he ſent not onely money from the common wealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> but alſo plentifully ſent his treaſure out of his owne coffers. In the moneth of Ianuarie, there was in <hi>Rome</hi> ſo furious a fire, that it burnt ten thouſand houſes, wherein there periſhed of men, women, and children, more then tenne thouſande. In the ſame yeare was burnt the ſtately place of <hi>Carthage,</hi> the one halfe of <hi>Antioche,</hi> and in a manner the whole citie of <hi>Narbona.</hi> In the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of Auguſt, there was at <hi>Rome</hi> great floudes: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, loſſe of their corne, both reapt and vnreapt. The riuer <hi>Tyber</hi> did ſo ſwell and ouerflowe, that one dayes loſſe was not repayred in thrée yeares. On the fourth of the monethe of Maie, there appeared a ſtarre ouer <hi>Rome,</hi> conteyning the quantitie of the whéele of a myll:
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:3692:77"/>
which threw out ſparkes ſo thicke and ſo continuall, that it ſéemed rather the fire of a forge, then the ſhining of a ſtarre. In the ſixt yeare of the Empire of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> was borne a childe with two heades, the one like a man, the other like a dogge: but the ſtraungeneſſe of the matter did more excéede, in that, with one head he did cry and barke, as a whelpe: and with the other did wéepe as a childe. In the citie of <hi>Capua,</hi> a woman was brought a bed and deliuered of fiue ſonnes. At that time was ſéene in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia,</hi> a great and a moſt huge ſerpent: which being ſéene of many perſons, vpon the height of a rocke, did eate halfe his owne tayle: in which yeare, there was throughout all <hi>Arabia,</hi> &amp; maruellous greate peſtilence. In the ninthe yeare of the Empire of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> in the citie of <hi>Meſia,</hi> barley was ſéene to growe in the heads of their trées: in ſuch wiſe, that no trée bare fruite that yeare, but eares of of barley. In the ſame yeare, there happened in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Artenitos,</hi> in a citie named <hi>Triponia:</hi> foure wilde and vnknowne Lions to lye downe in the market place: which became ſo tame, that they made them packehorſſe to the mountaines for wood, and boyes became horſſemen vppon their backes. In the kingdome of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> a childe was borne, which had the heade turned backwards, which liued, and was bred vp, and alſo ſuche as would ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſée or ſpeake with him, moſt conueniently did place them ſelues at his backe: which notwithſtanding, coulde both ſée, ſpeake, and go, but with his hands might not féede him ſelfe. There died in <hi>Rome</hi> a Senatour, named <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus,</hi> a man of great wealth and credite, whiche after his death did many times come to the Senate: ſitting in his wonted place, and clad with garments, after his olde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, but was neuer hearde ſpeake one worde: and this viſion continued in the Senate, full two yeares.</q>

King <hi>Abogarus</hi> one of the mightieſt and moſt notable kinges of the Orient, the Emperour <hi>Antoninus</hi> did force to come to <hi>Rome:</hi> bycauſe that owing a great ſumme of money vnto one of his vaſſals, he would not come to account.

for any thing paſt, any motion ſhould be made: affirming that his offence might not be ſo great, but that his ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue apparance did reforme the ſame. The <hi>Olbiopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> a people in <hi>Aſia,</hi> held warre with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

Generally hée was ſo liked and loued of al nations, that in all temples, in all walles, gates, and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, theſe foure letters were placed, namely V.A.C.R. whiche is to ſaye <hi>Vita Antonini Conſeruatur Respublica:</hi> which is to ſaye, <hi>On the life of Antoninus, the whole weale of the Romane Empire dependeth.</hi> Leauing a part many good lawes, which he made for the Common wealth, for which purpoſe, hee had alwayes attendant about him, men in the lawes ſingularly learned, who among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe was <hi>Vindemius Verus, Siluius Valente, Aboluſius Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus, Vlpius Marcellus,</hi> and <hi>Iabolinus:</hi> before whome hée ſet the lawes of all kingdomes, and of the moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie and approued, to take the choice to be eſtabliſhed in his kingdomes.

The Empreſſe <hi>Fauſtine</hi> being great with childe, and neare vnto the time of her childe byrth, dreamed that ſhe was deliuered of certaine ſerpents, but eſpecially of one, more fierce then the reſt: of which dreame, when his father <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed, they ſay, that he ſayde: <hi>I feare me Fauſtine, that the ſonne of this birth, ſhall proue ſo fierce a Serpent, that ſhall be of power to commit a murther of our fame, and to poyſon the whole common wealth of Rome.</hi> The Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers and Nekromantiques, which in thoſe dayes were

reſident in <hi>Rome,</hi> they ſayde and prognoſticated many things of the byrth of the Emperour <hi>Commodus</hi>: and as it appeared afterwardes they ſayde very little, in reſpect of that which followed: bycauſe this miſerable and vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Prince, in his manners, did rather reſemble the infernall furies, then reaſonable creatures. From his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie his father <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> carefully did trauell, in the learning and inſtruction of his ſonne <hi>Commodus:</hi> for whiche purpoſe, he made inquiſition throughout the whole Empire, for men learned in ſcience, and of life and manners refourmed. His firſt ſcholemaiſters were, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſicrates</hi> to teach him Gréeke, <hi>Capilus</hi> to inſtruct him in the Latine, <hi>Teyus</hi> to inſtruct him in the Art of Oratorie, <hi>Pulion</hi> to infourme him in Muſike, <hi>Calphurnius</hi> to giue him order for behauiour on horſbacke, and <hi>Marcius</hi> to giue him rules for good manners: for that his father ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no more ſonnes, did not a little trauell, to frame in him ſuche perfection, as was due vnto a moſt noble and perfect Prince.

At the age of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tene yeares, the Senate gaue him the title of <hi>Caeſar</hi>: not for the merite of the ſonne, but to yealde to the vertue of the father. The Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> ſéeing his ſonne increaſe in age, and decreaſe in vertue, aduiſed to place him in a college of prieſtes, with whom many ſonnes of noble men were bred: but in the end, he as little profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by the companie of prieſtes, as by the doctrine of his ſcholemaiſters: for he helde alwayes, enimitie with other mens counſell, and great friendſhip with his owne will.

               <p>JN the xvi. yere of the reigne of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> and in the 63. yere of his age, warre was raiſed in <hi>Pano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> which at theſe dayes is otherwiſe named <hi>Hungarie:</hi> in which warres the good Emperour woulde goe in his owne perſon, leading alſo with him his ſonne <hi>Commodus,</hi> according vnto his accuſtomed manner, that by the taſte of trauels in the warres, he ſhould bende and yelde him ſelfe to conſerue peace. The Emperour in the greateſt heate and furie of thoſe martiall affaires, was ſoudeinly ſtriken with a deadly ſickneſſe, and in fewe dayes depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of his life: <hi>Commodus</hi> being then in ſo tender yeares, that he neither felt what he loſt, either the daunger wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſtoode.

                           <p>The vniuerſall calamitie, and the particular ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, which for the death of my father, this ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full day doth repreſent, is no leſſe common vnto you then to mee: for if I haue loſt a pittifull father, you haue loſt a righteous and a iuſt Prince. My loſſe is not ſmall, that haue loſt ſuch a father, but much more haue you loſt, that haue loſt ſuch a Prince: becauſe the hurte of one is tollerable, but that which redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the offence of many, for euer is to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Experience teacheth vs, that of an hundred fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, there be not twaine, that are euill vnto their children: and by the contrarie, of an hundreth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ye ſhall hardly finde twaine, that exquiſitely ſhal proue good for their ſubiectes. If this be true, as it is moſte true, that I haue ſaide: it is iuſt, and verie iuſt, that if ſonnes lament the death of their parentes, with teares of their eyes: that ſubiectes bewaile the death of their good Princes, with drops from their heartes.</p>
                           <p>Howe humble my father hath beene vnto the Gods, how ſeuere with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked, howe affable with good men, how patient in iniuries, how grateful for
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:3692:83"/>
ſeruice, howe bountifull in his houſe, and howe zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the common wealth: although you haue ſeene, you haue not throughly comprehended: for that good Princes be not exactly knowen, vntil they be loſt. My father was ſo fortunate and venturous in the warres, ſo ſingular in ſcience, ſo ſincere and cleane of life, and ſo perfecte a louer of the common wealth, that the dead had enuie at the liuing, not of the life which they poſſeſſed, but of the Prince which they inioyed. It may not be denied, but that the Romaine Empire is in debt and beholding vnto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Princes paſt: but I ſaye and affirme, that Rome is more in debt vnto my father, aboue all other: for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers made the common wealth riche, but my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made it vertuous: others repaired walles, but he reformed manners: and that which is more, others brought to paſſe that Rome was feared of all ſtrange nations: but my father framed, that Rome of all in generall was both ſerued and beloued. You all well vnderſtande, what difference there goeth betwixt vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie, and forceable ſeruice: for as my father did vſe to ſaye, it is more tollerable to be commaunded of ſuche as loue vs, then to be ſerued of ſuch as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre vs. My father hath now finiſhed his iourney, and certeinly, moſte perfectly hath runne out his race: herein ye may conceiue his ineſtimable loue towardes you, in that he commended mee his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſonne into your handes: and if I followe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme his will, he gaue mee not the Empire to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund you, but to the ende I ſhould ſerue you, for he expreſſely gaue in charge, that my Empire ſhould tende more to your vtilitie, then to mine owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, humbly beſeeching the immortal Gods, to make
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:3692:83"/>
mee ſuch, as my father at his death commaunded, &amp; as you Romaines do wiſhe and deſire: becauſe there is no man in this worlde ſo euil, that deſireth not to be gouerned by a Prince that is good. You with me, and I with you, in the manner of our gouernement after his death, he did verie well expreſſe in the time of his life, directing me by commaundement to call you fellowes, and forbidding you to call me Lord: for his deſire was, that you ſhould fauour, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell me as a ſonne: and that I ſhould deale with you as with brethren, and truſt &amp; beleeue you as fathers. The loue which the gods do beare vs, the ſame my father alwayes vſed with you: that is to ſay, he did ſo tenderly loue you all, as if ye all had beene but one man: whereof it foloweth that you are not ſo much in his debt, for that which he did for you, as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hee woulde haue done, and coulde not. I remember me, that many times being a childe, my father delighted that ye ſhould take, imbrace, kiſſe, and cheriſh me: to the end that imbracing of me in your armes, ye ſhuld place me in your hartes: and alſo, that I finding your armes open, ſhoulde not vniuſtely cloſe my bowels from you. My Empire is not as the Empire of others, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, I neither bought it with money, either obteined it by voices, or wonne it by armes, or toke it by guile: no doubtles, it is not ſo: for as others obteine by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture, naturally I inherite. You haue great reaſon in minde to be ſatiſfied, and in harte contented, ſince ye haue a prince not deliuered by the hands of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but borne in your owne houſes. I confeſſe that to proue good, it auaileth muche to deſire and alſo procure to be good: but ioyntly herewith I ſaye, that to be a prince, it neceſſarily requireth to haue the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:3692:84"/>
fauour of his kingdome: for otherwiſe, if ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers do repugne, and ſubiects do not ſuccour, it may be in his owne handes to be a good man, but not in his power to be a good Prince.</p>
                           <p>My father was olde, and I am yong, wherof it fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> more glorie redoundeth vnto you, by yeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding obedience vnto me, then vnto my father: bicauſe obedience done vnto him, proceeded of the merit of his authoritie: but that which yee ſhall yealde vnto mee, proceedeth of your owne pure vertue. All the rewardes, honours, and offices, that my father gaue in time of his life from henceforth I confirme them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch as hold them: for that being (as he was) both holy and vertuous, the Gods aproouing all his actes, it were not iuſt, they ſhould be diſalowed of men. Neither in the dignities of the Senate, the captain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippes of the armies, the offices of my houſe, there is nothing to be ſayd, much leſſe to be altered: only one thing remaineth betwixt my father and mee, which is, that I confirme his good works, &amp; change my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reformed maners. Let vs ioyntly put on noble minds, to giue good end vnto the warres whiche my father hath ſo happily begunne, which being finiſhed, wee will all goe to our eaſe and ſolace, and inioy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Rome: whiche warres, if wee ſhould leaue vndone, although the hurte ſhould redound to mee, the faulte ſhould proceede and be imputed vnto you. I will not ſaye more vnto you, my friendes &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, but that I requeſt and deſire you, alwayes to commend vnto your memorie, the great loue that my father hath borne you, and the good dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling he alwayes vſed with you: that from his anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, my tender yeres, and your greate vertue, ye

maye frame a Prince, good for your ſelues, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for the common wealth.</p>
                           <p>Finally, I ſaye that if ye haue my father in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce, ye will neuer forget or diſobey mee his ſonne: for comparing his vertue with my libertie: doubtleſſe and without compariſon, ye ſhal be much more perſuaded by his nobleneſſe, then altered by my youthfulneſſe.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. How Commodus left the warres of Panonia to go to Rome.</head>
               <p>After that <hi>Pompeyanus</hi> had ended his Oration, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus</hi> did ſhew him ſelfe offended, for the opening thereof in ſo common aſſembly, and pleaſed for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie of his woordes, giuing for an anſwere, that for the preſent he woulde deferre his departing: vntill ripe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, ſhould determine ſome other matter. Not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his ſmall age, he was of ſuche diſſimulation in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he woulde bringe to paſſe, and ſo double in his words which he did ſpeake, that the aunſwere which he made, was not to the intente to ſtay his departing, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme them in negligence and want of prouidence. It was publiſhed in the whole armie, what <hi>Pompeyanus</hi> had ſayd vnto <hi>Commodus,</hi> and that the departing into <hi>Italie</hi> was deferred vntill the warres were finiſhed: of which newes ſome were pleaſed, and ſome diſpleaſed: becauſe the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and vertuous wiſhed all thinges to be done to the honour of the common wealth: but the younger perſons and ſuche as were vitious, had deſire to go the vices of <hi>Rome.</hi> Some remaining quiet, and others negligent, <hi>Commodus</hi> determined to procéede with his purpoſe: and wrote certeine letters vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> wherin he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they ſhoulde order his houſe and prepare for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge: and he did alſo write, that they ſhoulde relieue him with ſome monye, for that with the warres he was much conſumed. His letters being diſpatched vnto <hi>Rome, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus</hi> commaunded all the valiant capteins to come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his preſence, with whome he did communicate the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:3692:88"/>
manner and faſhion which he woulde vſe with thoſe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous people, to frame them to yeald to ſome honeſt truce: &amp; if a better co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion might not be obteined, to finiſh the ſame with a peace dearly bought. After that meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers had paſſed betwixt <hi>Commodus</hi> and the Barbarians diuerſly to and fro: in the ende it was reſolued, that hee rendered many countries, that had bene taken from the enimies, and alſo gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a great ſumme of money: and they promiſed to continue friendes, but not vaſſals vnto the <hi>Romaines.</hi> This concluſion being knowne and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, was not a little grieuous vnto all noble minds of the armie: becauſe moſt truely the capitulation thereof was too too infamous, that in reſpect of the ſtate of thoſe warrs it was not onely not to be done, either as much as to be talked of. Of theſe infamous concluſions, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paimente of ſo greate ſummes of money, he gaue no parte therof vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Senate or gouernours to vnderſtande, but vnto ſuch men of warre as he vnderſtoode had deſire to be gone, and ſuch as he thought durſt not repugne. The fame beinge publiſhed that <hi>Commodus</hi> would depart towards <hi>Rome,</hi> the whole armie was ſo altered, that none would remaine in the frontiers, but that euery man without order, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with greate haſt to returne into <hi>Italie:</hi> in ſuch wiſe that <hi>Commodus,</hi> not onely ceaſed to continue hoſtilitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Barbarians, but alſo left no garriſons, to guard the <hi>Romaine</hi> people.

               <p>Incredible was the pleaſure which they receiued in <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Commodus</hi> did write of his partinge from <hi>Panonia:</hi> but muche greater was their ioye, when they vnderſtoode that he was at hande: for remembringe

that he was borne amongeſt them, and that they had bred and nouriſhed him, and that he was the ſonne of ſo good a father: they helde it for certeine, that in his time <hi>Rome</hi> (more then euer it did) ſhould flouriſh, and that euery man in particular, ſhould augment his eſtate. In reſpect of the greate loue and reuerence they did beare vnto the father <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> and the reporte blowne amongſt the <hi>Romaines</hi> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſingular beautie of his ſonne <hi>Commodus,</hi> they did ſo extremly deſire to ſée him, that he held him ſelfe moſt happy that came furtheſt off to receiue him. Marche was halfe paſt when <hi>Commodus</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> at which time trées do yealde foorth their flowers, and fields their fragrant ſmelles: againſt the day that he ſhoulde enter <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Romains</hi> had made all wayes euen and cleane, and banqueting houſes deckte with boughes to eate and drincke in: the Senatours came forth in great order, the women of <hi>Rome</hi> in ſumptuous apparel, &amp; the towneſmen all with boughes and greene braunches, in ſuch manner they receiued him that day with as greate pleaſure and ioy, as if he had entered in his chariote triumphant trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinge of all <hi>Aſia.</hi> After he entred the citie, that whiche he firſte did, was, in viſitinge all the temples within the ſame: chieflye he ſtayed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> temple of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> where he offered ſumptuous ſacrifices, all the noble men of <hi>Rome</hi> being preſent. Alſo he did viſite certaine auncient ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, eſpecially y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſepulchre of <hi>Adrian,</hi> of <hi>Traiane,</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus Pius</hi> his grandfather, of <hi>Fauſtina</hi> his grand mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; <hi>Fauſtina</hi> alſo his mother: and ſome thinges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were in them euill handled, or decayed, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired and made better. Ioyning vnto the ſepulchre of <hi>Adrian,</hi> he commaunded another ſepulchre to be made, riche and ſumptuous, wherein the bones of his father <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> ſhoulde be tranſlated, which ſepulchre being finiſhed, and hauing in remembraunce howe greate loue <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> did beare them, and the good &amp; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere dealing he vſed with them, the <hi>Romaines</hi> did viſite, honour, and helde his ſepulchre in as greate reuerence, as
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:3692:89"/>
their chiefeſt temples. This done, <hi>Commodus</hi> on a day went vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Senate, ſaying and giuinge them warning, that in all and for all thinges, they ſhoulde followe the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunce of his father, and performe and execute all that he had commaunded them: becauſe after this manner, the imperial ſtate ſhould be conſerued as concerning ſtraunge nations: and the common wealth wel gouerned amongſt them ſelues. Alſo hee commaunded all Iudges of <hi>Rome</hi> to come before him, charginge and commaundinge them, that without all exception of perſons, equally to giue ſentence accordinge to iuſtice: with a warninge, that if any of them ſhoulde preſume to attempt the contrarie, to haue his ſentence reuoked, and his perſon chaſticed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romaines</hi> receiued greate delight, to ſée how <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus</hi> was obedient vnto the Gods, a louer of temples, grateful vnto his friendes, and zelous of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth: but alas for ſorrowe, ſo fewe were the monethes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the dayes, that this gratious heate endured, that it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med rather they had dreamed it, then that he had done or performed it.</p>

                           <p>O Commodus, it well ſeemeth that thou arte a

Prince, and that verie young, whiche arte in theſe playes and delightes ſo careleſſe and negligent, which thou oughteſt not to doe, becauſe Princes of thy age, eſtate, and condition, runne muche more in perill, in their exceſsiue pleaſures, then in their meane tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes. Being (as thou arte) rigorous with thine owne, and furious and vnbridled with ſtraungers, thou oughteſt to conſider, and not to be vnmindfull, that thou haſt enimies: for the Prince that is feared of manie, hath iuſt cauſe alſo to feare manie. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt riches, and the beſt treaſure in this world, is trueth, whereof Princes be moſte poore of all people: for that their eares being fild and led away with lyes, may take no taſte in matters of trueth. Thou Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus and other Princes, do not euil gouerne your common wealthes of any prepenced malice to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroye the ſame: but becauſe ye giue not, either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light your ſelues to heare the poore that be grieued and oppreſſed, when they complaine, neither the good, godly, and vertuous, when they giue aduiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of the greate and horrible vices of briberie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion, and violent robberies, committed by offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, by the priuate and fauoured, by the mightie and men of power. Great is the fault of Princes, for the vices which they committ, but much greater is their offence in diſſembling the offences of their fauoured ſeruaunts, becauſe ye offend not, but onely the Gods, but they both offende the Gods, vexe and trouble men, &amp; are traitours to your own perſons. Although Commodus, thou be licentious, diſſolute, wilfull, &amp; alſo not very honeſt: it is impoſsible, but if the hurtes and miſchiefes, ſcandals, and robberies, committed by thy officers &amp; fauoured ſeruants, were notified &amp;

giuen thee to vnderſtand, thou wouldeſt commaund them to be ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, &amp; alſo to be remedied: for in the ende there is no Prince ſo euill, that deſireth not his common wealth to flouriſh. At theſe dayes, trueth in Princes houſes is ſo odious, that who ſo aduentureth but to make reporte therof, of death he muſt haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination: and if any ſuch do eſcape with life, it pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceedeth of ſome conceite to be ſpoken of madneſſe. That, which at this preſent I will ſay &amp; diſcouer, I proteſt vnto the immortal Gods, it proceedeth not of madneſſe, for that my natural iudgement is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with reaſon: either do I ſay it of malice, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged of any perſon: but onely (Oh Commodus) to deliuer thy life of great peril, and to franchiſe Rome from ſeruitude of a tyrant: for that which I preſume to ſaye, and aduenture to diſcouer, I am aſſured before my tale be ended, my life ſhalbe taken away. But (O Commodus) I giue thee to vnderſtande, that if thou wilt not giue faith vnto my woordes, the time will come, when thou ſhalt vnderſtand the trueth, of all that I haue ſaide, when thy miſchiefe may haue no remedie. Thou (Commodus) art there ſet &amp; placed, with the Empreſſe Criſpina on thy right hand, &amp; on thy left hand thy priuate &amp; fauoured Perennius, but hadſt thou certeine intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, what he hath ordeined againſt thee, with thine owne hands y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> wouldeſt burie him quick.

               <p>EXcéeding ioy did the <hi>Romaines</hi> receiue of the death of <hi>Perennius,</hi> and his ſonnes, becauſe his auarice and pride was more ſharpe and intollerable, then the folly of <hi>Commodus.</hi> The offices of <hi>Perennius</hi> were diuided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt many: becauſe it ſéemed, that ſo greate authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and power, to be placed and committed in one perſon, were to put his life in perill, and his Empire to commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Incredible and innumerable were the richeſſe, iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and money, that were confiſcate by the death of <hi>Peren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and his ſonnes: but they were ſo wilfully and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly diuided and ſpent, that whatſoeuer <hi>Perennius</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by extortion and briberie, <hi>Commodus</hi> ſpent &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in vices. There was in thoſe dayes in <hi>Italie</hi> a certeine man named <hi>Maternus,</hi> who from his childhood was bred in the armies of <hi>Illyria:</hi> of nature bolde and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, ſubtile, painefull, ſharpe or quicke, proude, ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſtammering, in ſuch wiſe, that as he was filthie of his toung, ſo was he ſoudeine of his handes. In all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, ſeditions, and mutinies which happened in the campes, or cities, this <hi>Maternus</hi> was euer founde one, either the chiefe authour thereof, or elſe to be noted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the reſt, becauſe they ſaye, <q>this was his common ſpeache, that on that daye, wherein he ſhed no bloude, wine had no good reliſhe.</q>
The captaines of the armies did partly beare with him for his valiantneſſe, but on the other ſide, they might not endure his continuall quare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges, and in the ende his lewdneſſe being growen intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, they did not onely diſpatche him from the warres, but alſo did baniſhe him the confines of <hi>Italie.</hi>

               <p>AFter the death of the tyrant <hi>Maternus,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Commodus</hi> paſſed his life in great doubt and feare, i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magining with himſelfe, that ſome day they would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch him, either eating or ſléeping: for he did both knowe, and alſo would ſay, that they were fewe which prayed for his life, but very many that ſighed for his death.

               <p>Very ſéeldome he went to the Senate, and much leſſe
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:3692:98"/>
did ride openly in the citie: hée had not talke with ſtrangers but by writing: with his ſubiects he had no conference, but by a perſon intermitted: and that which was more mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, hée had many times ſuch conceite, not onely to refuſe to write, aunſweare, heare cauſes, or diſpatch affayres: but alſo in foure or fiue dayes would not ſpeake onely one word.
<q>In the xi. yeare of his Empyre, <hi>Maternus</hi> the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt was ſlaine: on the next yeare there followed a great peſtilence, and a generall hunger, in which hunger and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence, the third part of <hi>Italie</hi> was conſumed. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly after the peſtilence had entred <hi>Rome, Commodus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie of <hi>Laurento,</hi> where were planted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Laurel trées, for which cauſe the citie was named <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rento:</hi> where alſo the Emperour more remayned, then in any other place: the Phyſicians giuing him to vnderſtand, that to be vnder the ſhadowe therof, was very proper and conuenient for defence of the peſtilence. Notwithſtanding the ſcarſitie of bread and wine that was that yeare, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a certaine occaſion of great hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger happened in <hi>Rome,</hi> which was as followeth. When the good <hi>Marcus Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> triumphed ouer the <hi>Argonautes,</hi> he brought amongeſt other captiues a younge man named <hi>Cleander:</hi> who was openly ſolde in the market place in <hi>Rome,</hi> and by chaunce bought by a clarke of the kitchin, to ſwéepe &amp; make cleane the larder at courte. This ſlaue <hi>Cleander</hi> became ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in ſwéeping, ſeruing, and pleaſing his maiſter, that not many yeares after, he did not onely make him frée, and marrie him with his daughter, but alſo did aduance him to the office of Clarke of the kitchin: in ſuch maner, that from the eſtate of a bondman, hée indued him with the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſonne.

                  <q>
                     <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> being deade, <hi>Commodus</hi> forgate not to remoue <hi>Cleander</hi> from the affayres of the kitchin, and made him capitaine of his guard, and Lord great Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine of his chamber. Vnto none of as many as did ſerue &amp; accompany <hi>Commodus</hi> in his youth that hée was gratefull, but vnto <hi>Cleander</hi>: vnto whom it had bin much better, neuer to haue riſen to ſo great honour: for thereof onely procéeded the loſſe of his life. Althoughe the fauour of <hi>Cleander</hi> did riſe in ieſt or of ſmall cauſes, he framed in fewe dayes to performe the ſame in earneſt, which was as followeth: that as <hi>Commodus</hi> grew into diſgrace, &amp; was abhorred and had no care of the gouernement of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, <hi>Cleander</hi> did preſſe and in ſuch maner did thronge to entermedle with affayres, that for the more part all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were diſpatched at his will and pleaſure: in ſuch wiſe, that <hi>Commodus</hi> gaue or firmed nothinge, if <hi>Cleander</hi> did not ſigne or allowe the ſame. <hi>Commodus</hi> had neuer any priuate or fauoured ſeruaunt, that in all points could ſo winne his will as <hi>Cleander</hi>: who affirmed to wiſhe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that <hi>Commodus</hi> wiſhed not, either to allowe any thing that hée ſaid not: but aduouched alſo that he did not thinke or dreame, but that which <hi>Commodus</hi> did dreame and thinke: and with theſe and ſuche like lyes and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, hee wan the hart of <hi>Commodus,</hi> and obteyned ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the whole Empire. After <hi>Cleander</hi> beheld him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the onely priuate and fauoured ſeruaunt of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus,</hi> hée eaſily made himſelfe rich: obteyning the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, not onely of the whole common treaſure, but alſo the kéeping of all the monie and iewels of the Emperour <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But <hi>Cleander</hi> finding himſelfe in ſo great magnificence, began not greatly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde ſo great fauour, or much leſſe the obteyning of ſo great wealth: conceyuing in the end, that <hi>Commodus</hi> did vſe him as a vaſſall, and that hée muſt accompt him as his Lord: to cut off which opprobrie, and to giue contentation vnto his heart, he determined to kill <hi>Commodus,</hi> and for
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:3692:99"/>
himſelfe to vſurpe the Empire. <hi>Cleander</hi> did build at the port <hi>Salaria,</hi> moſt coſtly and delectable bathes, and comaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded proclamation to be made in <hi>Rome,</hi> to notifie vnto all men, that would bathe therein, to be diſcharged of all coſt, and fréely to vſe the ſame: and alſo added thereunto great paſtimes, and preparations vnto all kinde of vices: in ſuch wiſe, that there they cleanſed their bodies, &amp; defiled their ſoules. Many times <hi>Cleander</hi> did inuite the Senate, and ſent them particular preſents home to their houſes: The Pretors, Cenſors, Queſtors, Tribunes, Prefectes, and other <hi>Romane</hi> officers, he cauſed their dueties to be paied: and all the men of warre he did not onely pay them, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo did trauel to hold them contented: in ſuch maner, that ſome with vitious delights and pleaſures, and ſome by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, giftes, and monie, in a maner he recouered all men for his friendes. In the yeare of great hunger and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in <hi>Italie, Cleander</hi> bought all the wheat in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries adioyning vnto <hi>Rome:</hi> wherein his intent was, not to gaine or make a profite thereof, but to bring <hi>Rome</hi> into a neceſſitie, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end that all men ſhould come to his houſe for wheate: and therein to haue vſed ſo great liberalitie, in ſelling good cheape, and giuing plentifully, in a yeare ſo deare, that after the death of the Emperour <hi>Commodus,</hi> they ſhould not miſlike to giue him the Empire. And as hunger increaſed cruelly, a great part of the yeare beeing as yet to come, and the people not knowing <hi>Cleanders</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, who did neither giue or ſell any wheate: ſoudainly al <hi>Rome</hi> did riſe, exclaming death and treaſon againſt <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> as an vſurper of the goodes of the common wealth. <hi>Cleander</hi> being a man valiaunt, of great power, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the guard, comaunded all the men of his captaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to be armed: who did place themſelues in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of his houſe, for the garde of his perſon, and to reſiſte that ciuil furie: although it be moſt true, that hée rather defended the ſacking of his houſe, then of feare to defende his life. The towneſmen on the one ſide, and <hi>Cleander</hi> on the other part, trauerſed amongeſt themſelues ſo long and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:3692:100"/>
perillous a contention: that it ſéemed no other matter, but that <hi>Silla</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> were once more fallen into fight, for the ſeignorie of <hi>Rome.</hi> And as <hi>Cleanders</hi> partie was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with men both armed and determined, in the firſt onſet they executed ſo great ſlaughter amongeſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that ſcarſly a ſtreate was to be founde in <hi>Rome,</hi> that was not bathed with bloud: either any place great or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that was not filled with dead bodies. The towneſmen perceyuing the ſlaughter and hauocke which the men of warre ſo cruelly did performe amongeſt them, retired e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man into his houſe: and fortifying their doores, they fought from their windowes and houſe toppes, and from thence threw and whirld out ſtones, tiles, ſpitts, potts, and caldrons: and in that ſo common danger, no leſſe did wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fight then men: &amp; <hi>Cleanders</hi> partie ſo hardly handled, that ſcarcely remained a hundred y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were not ſlaine or wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. Whilſt theſe déeds were doing at <hi>Rome, Commodus</hi> was recreating himſelfe in an houſe which he had in an orchard, and <hi>Cleander</hi> being of great power, of ſome feared, and of others beloued, no man durſt make report therof vnto <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus,</hi> becauſe ſo ſtrong was the frendſhip betwixt them, that they feared the diſpleaſure of the one, and the vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of them both. There was in the Courte a ſiſter vnto <hi>Commodus</hi> named <hi>Fadilla</hi>: whoſe eyes being charged w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> teares, and tearing her haire from her head, as one in gret diſtreſſe, ſaid vnto her brother <hi>Commodus. Moſt ſerene prince, and right deare brother, if thou wert aduertiſed of the condition and eſtate of Rome, thou wouldeſt not be ſo careleſſe ſolacing in this garden: becauſe I giue thee to vnderſtand, that the yeome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thy guard in the fauour of Cleander, and al the other people of the common wealth, haue trauerſed amongeſt themſelues ſo cruell a fight, that if preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly at this inſtant thou prouide not ſome remedie, this day wil be the end of the Romane people. The exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding honour, the great riches, &amp; to to much fauour which thou haſt imployed vppon Cleander, hath raiſed him into exceeding great pride, wherof although he be in the fault,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:3692:100"/>
yet the occaſion hath beene giuen by thee: for as thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt Lordes of bondmen, it is moſt certaine that they will make ſlaues of Lords &amp; noblemen.

His friends, his kinſefolks, his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers, his ſeruaunts, his natural ſubiects, and alſo ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, hée held them all his vtter enimies: <q>becauſe he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that all maner of men, that came to ſpeake with him, came to deceiue him: and ſuch as repaired to viſite him,
that by treaſon they would kill him. In the xij. yeare of his Empire on the xvij. day of March, at noone the heauen was ſéene full of ſtarres, as if it had béene midnight: and that which was moſt meruell, and neuer read in bookes, or ſéen with eyes, that on the euening when the Sunne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally was accuſtomed to be ſéene to ſett in the Weſte, they beheld riſing in the Eaſt. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moneth of Iuly next following, a Comet appeared in heauen, as large as a great beame, and ſo flamed with fire, directing his ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles vnto the citie of <hi>Rome.</hi> On the xx. day of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of Auguſt, ſoudenly the heauens being cleare, neither raynie or cloudie, in <hi>Rome</hi> there ſtrake an horrible clap of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:3692:101"/>
thunder: and after the thunder, there came a globe of fire, which burned the temple, named <hi>the temple of peace.</hi>
                  </q>
This te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple in authoritie was moſt auncient, in buildinges moſt ſtately, in riches moſt wealthie, with prieſtes moſt publiſhed, and in deuotion moſt eſtéemed: becauſe in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches, the <hi>Romanes</hi> might pray vnto their Gods ſitting or ſtanding: but there were forced to pray on their knées. All men which had monie, treaſure, iewels, or rich ſtuffe, layd it all vp in <hi>the temple of peace:</hi> not onely thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them moſt ſafe, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtronge building of the Church, but alſo of deuotion to commende and offer their goodes vnto <hi>the God of peace,</hi> to obteine permiſſion to enioy qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes.
<q>The loſſe which the <hi>Romanes</hi> receiued, by thoſe flames of fire, did excéede all reckoning: for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in a maner all rich men had there their riches burnt &amp; conſumed: in ſuch wiſe, that no heart might endure, either yet diſſemble, to heare the cries of men, and the exclamation of women: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man recounting his loſſe vnto his neighbour, &amp; ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bewayling the burning of the temple. Now when the temple of peace was burnt, viſibly they did ſée it paſſe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>the temple of the veſtall virgins:</hi> which wholy it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, leauing no ſigne of any building thereof. And yet notwithſtanding, better order was taken for the remedie thereof, then in the other temple: for preſently vppon the kindling of the fire, they tooke out the veſtall virgins, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che there were incloſed, and the reliques which the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> had there repoſed And for as much as wée haue ſaid of reliques, it is to vnderſtand, that the <hi>Romanes</hi> had in that temple the <hi>Palladium:</hi> that is to ſay, the image of the goddeſſe <hi>Pallas,</hi> which fell from heauen vpon the walls of <hi>Troy,</hi> and from thence was brought to <hi>Rome:</hi> which was holden in as great veneration, as the arke of the Lord amonges the Iſraelites. The <hi>Romanes</hi> held that Image of the Goddeſſe <hi>Pallas,</hi> ſo ſhut vp, incloſed and hidden: that long time after ſhée was brought from <hi>Troy,</hi> of mortall man being neuer ſéene: either of Conſul, Emperour, or prieſt: for they had a prophecie, that in the yeare, in which
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:3692:102"/>
that Image ſhould be ſéene, there ſhould be great chaunge in the proſperitie of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Romanes</hi> remoued their veſtall virgins, and the Image of their Goddeſſe <hi>Pallas,</hi> vnto the houſe of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus:</hi> and ſo great was the lamentation amongeſt the <hi>Romanes,</hi> to behold their veſtall virgins ſet at large, and their <hi>Palladium</hi> diſcouered, that without compariſon they did much more bewaile the burning of their temple of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, then the other temple that conteyned all their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
<q>After this globe of fire had burned the temple of Peace, and the temple of Reliques, it burned alſo many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſumptuous buildinges: not burning alongeſt after the manner of other fire, but amongeſt many houſes burnt one, and farre off from thence would burne another: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the <hi>Romanes</hi> did gather, that it was not the fire in vſe amongeſt men, ſeruing onely to burne: but a fire ſent from the Godds, to conſume and chaſtice.</q>
Theſe terrible fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges, and prodigious ſpectacles, of the <hi>Romanes</hi> being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, if vntil that time they did wiſhe the Emperour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, from thenceforth they could neither endure to behold him, either abide with patience to heare his name: for they held it for certeintie, <q>that all thoſe euill ſignes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Godds did threaten the Common wealth, were
all ſent for his foule and filthie life. This globe of fire continued by the ſpace of a xi. dayes: in all which time it ceaſed not to burne temples and houſes. On the xij. day <hi>Commodus</hi> rode out of the citie, and at the inſtante that he went out at the gates, ſoudainely the fire ceaſed: which confirmed the <hi>Romanes</hi> in their opinion, namely that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the life of <hi>Commodus,</hi> the <hi>Romane</hi> people of the gods ſhould alwayes be ſcourged.</q>

               <p>AS it hath béene ſaid, <hi>Commodus</hi> continued certaine dayes very ſad and penſiue, when he conſidered how traytors ſought occaſion to take away his life, and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible flames and burninges of <hi>Rome:</hi> but in ſhort time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hee both forgat the chaſtiſement of the Gods, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies of men: and this manifeſtly appeared, for that he ſo ſtoutly returned to all his vices, as if he had neuer beene vitious. <hi>Cleander</hi> being dead, hée made <hi>Niger</hi> Prefect, and after ſixe houres hee did reuoke his power, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him to be baniſhed: and prouided alſo <hi>Galba Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus</hi> for his Chamberlaine, whom after foure houres he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of his office, and ſent him in exile: and when <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> &amp; <hi>Rufus</hi> complained of their griefes, <hi>Commodus</hi> aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweared, hée did not baniſhe them for that which they had done, but for that which they might doe. He created Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Marcus Dulius,</hi> a man (moſt certaine) right generous and auncient: whome after thrée dayes hée remoued from his office, and comaunded him vntill his death, in his houſe to be priſoner, the occaſion whereof was, for that (as hée af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed) <hi>Marcus</hi> was very old and ſpente, and therefore it were no reaſon he ſhould be troubled of any perſon: and alſo, that if any man ſhould requeſt any thing, hée mighte aunſweare him, that hée was a priſoner, and might not go out of his doores to doe him pleaſure. He gaue the Senate to vnderſtand, that hée would go into <hi>Africa,</hi> and had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, for his nauie by ſea, &amp; his army by land, of a great ſumme of monie: although the Senate did ſuſpect it but a colluſion, they durſt not but open the treaſurie, and diuide with him the treaſure: for otherwiſe, he would both make hauoche of their liues and treaſure.</p>

<q>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third day following. One day he clad himſelf as a prieſt, right pontifically, and placed himſelfe aloft on a choche of 4. furious horſes: the <hi>Romanes</hi> ſuppoſing he would offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices at the temple, he mounted certeine rockie cliftes &amp; mountaines: and there againſt all reaſon ran his charriot, where his horſes happened to be all to torne, &amp; his chariot rent all to péeces, and hée brake his head, and wrenched his foote: finally he made a narrow miſſe, in repayment of his follie, that day to haue loſt his life.</q>
On a day he went to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Senate, and ſaid that hee would not haue <hi>Rome</hi> named <hi>Rome,</hi> but <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modiana:</hi> and the Senate aunſwered, they were both pleaſed to call <hi>Rome Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modiana,</hi> and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modiano.</hi> That which the Senators ſuppoſed to be demaunded in ieſt, alſo conſenting in ieſt, <hi>Commodus</hi> did accept in earneſt: &amp; from thenceforth, the letters which were written, the prouiſions which were made, &amp; the ſeals therto ioyned, in al ſuch inſtruments <hi>Rome</hi> was intituled <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modiana,</hi> &amp; the Senate <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modiano:</hi> and if by neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce any man happened to be obliuious therof, &amp; to vſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of <hi>Rome,</hi> preſently he was baniſhed from thence, to ſéeke <hi>Rome:</hi> for that was not, but <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modiana.</hi>

Hée was not onely in his woordes and workes, vaine and friuolous, but alſo in his letters which hée wrote for the Empire: for that many times being aduertiſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> countries and prouinces, of cauſes of great importance, he would anſweare them with matters of vanitie: and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times would ſende an whole ſhéete of paper ſealed and fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, conteyning onely one Latine woord, that is to ſay, <hi>Vale.</hi> Notwithſtanding the dayes of his reigne were the moſt vnfortunate dayes, yet would hee néedes commaund them to be termed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> golden world. Moſt heynous offences hée would pardon for monie: if any perſon being abſent were condemned to die, hée would finde out ſome other of his age and name, to be executed for his offence: affirming that ſince he did reſemble him in age and name, hée ſhould not varie in the maner of his death: in ſuch wiſe, that this tyrant did kill innocents for the wicked, and let offenders eſcape for monie. If any man had an enimie of whom he would take vengeaunce, hée néeded no other meane to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the ſame, but to bargaine with <hi>Commodus</hi> for a ſumme of monie, which being agréed he neuer wanted oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to rid him of his life.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE emperour <hi>Publius Pertinax</hi> was borne in the prouince of <hi>Apennia</hi> in a certeine place named <hi>Martos,</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond yere of the Empire of <hi>Traiane:</hi> and his father was named <hi>Lineotinus,</hi> a man that liued by his owne proper ſweate and trauaile. <hi>Pertinax</hi> beeing a ſtripling, ſerued his father with the carriage of wood vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an aſſe, to be ſolde at the towne, who vſed to ſell ſo déere, contentious, and pinching, that if they gaue him not his firſt demaunde, he did rather leaue his wood vnſolde, then abate one blanke of his price. And being noted of all men, and but for a packeman, it procéeded thereof to be named <hi>Pertinax,</hi> that is to ſay, contentious: for that before time he was named <hi>Publius. Pertinax</hi> perceiuing that he was now called, not <hi>Publius,</hi> but <hi>Pertinax,</hi> contentious and packman, he parted from his countrie in a greate chafe, and ſhamed, giuing him ſelfe to write and read: whiche when he had learned, he traueiled to atteine the Gréeke &amp; Latine tounges, which alſo he obteined: in ſuch wiſe, that he became more handſome in ſcience, then in ſelling of wood. Nowe when <hi>Pertinax</hi> perceiued him ſelfe to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed bothe in the Gréeke and Latine tounges, he gaue him ſelfe vnto the warres, to learne the arte of warre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:3692:107"/>
perceiuing that from his ſtudie there procéeded much traueile, and no profit: and that his life diminiſhed, and his goods nothing increaſed. In thoſe dayes the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines</hi> helde warres with the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> againſt whome the Conſul <hi>Lolianus</hi> was capteine, where <hi>Pertinax</hi> being repaired, made couenant with a capteine of <hi>Rome</hi> to ſerue him for his prouiſion, in the condition of a cater: who vſing his ſeruice in that office verie faithfully, and in ſkirmiſhe and encounter with the enimie no leſſe valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his maiſter remoued from his ſaide office, and aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to the ſtate of a Souldiour. Not long after that <hi>Pertinax</hi> had ſerued in the condition of a ſouldiour, but he was raiſed to an office of more honour and credite, which in theſe dayes, is termed Sergeant of the hande, that is to wéete, to giue order vnto the ſouldiours, to ſette in arraye. <hi>Pertinax</hi> euery daye recouered fame in the warres, and his valiantneſſe and noble minde was noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious vnto all men in the campe. It chaunced at the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous encounter of the enimie, the capteine of his hande to be ſlaine: whereof the Conſul <hi>Lolianus</hi> commaunded him to take the charge, wherein he did ſo behaue him ſelf, that not long after, he did not onely with bloud, reuenge the bloud of his capteine, but alſo brought to paſſe, to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the <hi>Romaines,</hi> and feared of the enimies. The warres of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> being finiſhed, <hi>Pertinax</hi> remained as pretor thereof, and as he was feared of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> in the time of warre: ſo was he afterwardes beloued in time of peace: for if in times paſt he had béene rigorous, as vnto enimies: ſo was he in proceſſe without all compariſon, more pittifull vnto offenders. In the ſeconde yeare of the Empire of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> the king of <hi>Parthians</hi> rebelled againſt the <hi>Romanes,</hi> &amp; amongſt other Capteines that were called vnto that conqueſt, was <hi>Pertinax</hi> the Pretor of <hi>Aſſyria:</hi> in which warres, ſo ſtraight and ſound frindſhip was planted betwixt <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinax,</hi> that from thenceforth they dealte not as maiſter and ſeruaunt, but as father and ſonne: becauſe no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:3692:108"/>
were it of moſte greate importance whiche <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> commaunded, that <hi>Pertinax</hi> perfourmed not, and exactly did not accompliſhe: either any counſell mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by <hi>Pertinax</hi> vnto <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> vnto whiche he yealded not. In thoſe <hi>Parthian</hi> warres, <hi>Pertinax</hi> proued ſo prouident in perils, ſo doughtie in hazardes, ſo wiſe in counſell, ſo venturous in ſallies, and ſo vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in battaile, that by reporte of the enimies and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the armies, he onely deſerued more glorie then all the reſt. The warres of <hi>Aſia</hi> being finiſhed, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> ſente him as Pretor vnto the prouince of great <hi>Britaine,</hi> which nowe is called Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande.</p>
               <p>Two yeares after he arriued into <hi>Britaine,</hi> warre was raiſed againſt the <hi>Germaines,</hi> vnto which warres <hi>Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax</hi> was alſo called, and there had the charge of the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, which was to be bearer of the royall ſtandarde, and was called the Eagle, becauſe the <hi>Romanes</hi> had alwayes in that ſpeciall ſtandard an Eagle brauely painted.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Pertinax</hi> being reſident in the warres of <hi>Germanie,</hi> his owne mother from <hi>Rome,</hi> came to viſite him, for that tenne yeres had paſſed in whiche ſhée had not ſéene him: and not tenne dayes after ſhée had inioyed the ſight of her deſired ſonne, ſhée dyed and paſſed out of this worlde.

The affaires of <hi>Germanie</hi> being ſettled, the Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelias</hi> ſent his commaundement vnto <hi>Pertinax,</hi> to paſſe into <hi>Datia,</hi> which nowe is named <hi>Denmarke:</hi> and did aſſigne him fiftie thouſande ſextercies for his ſtipend, whiche may amount to fiue thouſande Ducates of our money: whereat manye did enuie, no leſſe for the greate ſummies of money which he gaue him, then for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable gouernement that he committed vnto him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>It is an auncient cuſtome in the malice of man, to holde nothing for well done, but that which we loue, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be euil: and to eſteeme nothinge for euill, but that which we hate, although it be right perfect.</hi> There came from <hi>Datia</hi> certeine ſouldiours to <hi>Rome,</hi> whiche gaue foorth ſo peruerſe and foule information againſte <hi>Pertinax,</hi> that preſently the Emperour did ſuſpende his office, and diſcharged him of his ſtipende, and that he ſhoulde ſerue one whole yeare at his owne proper coſtes in <hi>Illyria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This imperiall commaundement being notified vnto <hi>Pertinax,</hi> preſently with greate patience he obeyed, and departed vnto <hi>Illyria</hi> to perfourme his baniſhement with much conſtancie: and they ſaye, that he ſaide theſe words at his departing.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. ¶Of the variable fortune that Pertinax did paſſe before he obteined the Empire.</head>
               <p>THE emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> helde <hi>Pertinax</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a man both vertuous, valiant, ſilent, of a noble minde, and alſo fortunate: but after he had by falſe report exiled him, he helde him both for wiſe, and of great patience, conſidering howe mildly he endured ſo vniuſt baniſhment, and afterwardes howe friendly he ſued for his aduerſaries. In recompence of the iniurie whiche <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> the Emperour had done vnto <hi>Pertinax,</hi> he made him Pretor of <hi>Datia,</hi> and ſent him ioyntly with his prouiſion, the enſigne, and did alſo conſtitute him cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine of the firſt legion: that is to ſaye, to haue the vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of the armie, which in the warres is a matter of moſte truſt, and alſo of honour: in ſuche wiſe, that where as his enimies had thought moſte to haue confounded him, from thence he receiued occaſion to be moſt aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. The prouince of <hi>Noricus</hi> and <hi>Retius</hi> rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Romaines</hi>: againſt whome the armies of <hi>Illy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> were ſent, vnto whome they gaue aduertiſement that they were readie to be reduced vnto the ſeruice of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi> Empire, if the Pretor that preſently did gouerne them were remoued, and in his place they might obteine <hi>Pertinax</hi> for their Protector: ſaying and affirming, that they rebelled not, to retire from the ſubiection of <hi>Rome</hi>: but becauſe their officers did oppreſſe them with cruell dealing. Great ioye had the Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> when he vnderſtood thoſe prouinces to be reduced vnto his
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:3692:109"/>
ſeruice: but much more did he reioyce, when he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed, howe inſtantly they craued <hi>Pertinax</hi> for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of that countrie: vnto whome preſently he ſent, both crauing and commaunding: and to the ende that <hi>Pertinax</hi> ſhoulde accept his ſuite, and condeſcende vnto his commaundement, he ſent him the enſigne and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie of Conſulſhip. Many dayes after that theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had paſſed, the Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> ſent for <hi>Pertinax,</hi> which had béene abſent ſixtéene yeares, and as he was in martial affaires, famous, ſo generally they came foorth into the ſtréetes of <hi>Rome</hi> to beholde him, as it had béene ſome monſter, brought from the deſertes of <hi>Aegypt</hi>: and being arriued at <hi>Rome,</hi> he was conducted by the Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> vnto the Senate: and after all ſortes and faſhions was praiſed and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as an aſſured friende doeth vſe to praiſe and honour his approued friende, which was great noueltie in <hi>Rome</hi>: that is to ſaye, for one Prince to ſpeake for another in the Senate: for vnto ſuch like Capteines as vnto <hi>Pertinax,</hi> they did onely heare what they would ſaye, but vſed not to aunſwere any one woorde within the Senate. Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Kalendes of Ianuary next enſuing, <hi>Pertinax</hi> was created Conſul: which the Emperour wiſhed the Senate had not perfourmed, to the ende he woulde haue made him Pretor principall, becauſe he eſtéemed him to be in poſſeſſion of greate wiſedome, for gouernement of matters of the common wealth, and very vpright to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter iuſtice. The people inhabitant neare vnto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubie,</hi> did write vnto the Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> howe they were robbed, loſt, and euil gouerned: and that if <hi>Pertinax</hi> were not ſent to gouerne that prouince, er long the whole countrie would rebell: which <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius</hi> vnderſtanding, framed and forced him to returne vnto <hi>Danubie</hi>: and to the ſame ende he gaue him power and ſtipende ſo accompliſhed, that he reſerued vnto him ſelfe but onely the name of Emperour his Lord,</p>
               <p>One yere after that <hi>Pertinax</hi> had gouerned <hi>Danubie,</hi>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:3692:110"/>
the Senate ſent him newe prouiſion for the gouernement of <hi>Datia,</hi> by the occaſion of the death of <hi>Caſsius</hi>: and that alſo he ſhould vſe the reſidence of the Pretor of <hi>Panonia:</hi> in ſuche wiſe, that there was no matter, either in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour or higher <hi>Almaine,</hi> that by the handes of <hi>Pertinax</hi> was not gouerned and prouided. Two yeares after the death of the Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius, Pertinax</hi> was remoued from the gouernement of <hi>Germanie,</hi> and aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto <hi>Syria</hi>: the gouernement whereof was the beſt, the moſt honourable, and alſo the moſte profitable that was giuen by the <hi>Romanes:</hi> 
                  <q>for that it was not beſtowed, but vppon the moſte auncient Conſul, or the moſte vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant capteine, or the moſte graue Senatour, or the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour
that heſt had perfourmed his charge. All the life of the good Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius, Pertinax</hi> in all his offices was founde to be verie wiſe, verie iuſt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere, and no leſſe ſincere: but after the good Emperour was dead, he grewe negligent, and alſo was noted with the blemiſhe of a nigarde, and couetouſneſſe, becauſe from thenceforth, he did rather imploye his forces to gather ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe, then to gouerne the common wealth.</q>
Of this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table example it may be inferred, of that which euerye day we ſée to chaunce: which is, <hi>that good Princes, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil men make good ſeruauntes, and euil Princes of good men, make euil ſeruauntes: for that many times, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſeruaunt naturally be euil, he doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour and enforce him ſelfe to be good, in reſpect of his maiſter which is good: and ſo by the contrarie, if the Prince be euil, the ſeruaunt ſtrayeth vnto euill, although of his owne nature he be good.</hi>

The matter fell out after this manner, that <hi>Pertinax</hi> found him ſelfe in ſo great perill, that all men thought he had béene ſlaine: yet amongſt the dead he eſcaped aliue, notwithſtanding cruelly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

               <p>AFter that <hi>Martia, Letus, Electus,</hi> and <hi>Narciſſus</hi> had ſlaine the Emperour <hi>Commodus,</hi> a greate parte of the night being paſſed, and all perſons in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> palace being cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnder the gouernement of profound ſléepe, <hi>Martia</hi> and her companions tooke the carkaſe of <hi>Commodus,</hi> and wrapt it in an olde Seron, wherein the ſlaues did beare out the ordure of the ſtable: giuing them to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande, that it was a certeine veſſel, with a charge alſo to carrie it forth. After the bodie was remoued out of the courte, they laide it into a carre, and conueyed it into a certeine village named <hi>Ariſtro</hi> where <hi>Commodus</hi> did vſe to bathe and ſolace: but on the next daye his death being publiſhed, the <hi>Romanes</hi> purſued, and although he were dead, they cutt off his head, and trailed his bodie through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the ſtréetes of <hi>Rome. Martia, Letus,</hi> and <hi>Electus,</hi> conſidering they had ſlaine <hi>Commodus,</hi> and beſtowed his carkaſe at their pleaſure, aduiſed amongeſt them ſelues to ſéeke out, and to name an Emperour before daye ſhoulde come vppon them: to the ende the Empire ſhould haue an owner, as alſo to haue defence vnder his protection: and ſo it came to paſſe, when the death of the one was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, the election of the other was publiſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:3692:112"/>the matter hapned after this manner: <hi>Letus</hi> and <hi>Electus</hi> talkinge with them, certeine of their eſpeciall frindes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted ſtreight vnto the houſe of <hi>Pertinax,</hi> knocking at the gate to haue it opened with greate haſte: one of the ſonnes of <hi>Pertinax</hi> beholding them to come armed, at ſuch an hour, and with ſuch haſt, was taken with ſo great feare, that when he woulde haue made reporte thereof vnto his father, terrour and trembling woulde not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to ſpeake.</p>
               <p>At the inſtant that <hi>Pertinax</hi> vnderſtood how <hi>Letus</hi> and <hi>Electus</hi> were come with armed men, he leapt from his bedde and commaunded his gates with greate ſpede to be opened, which procéeded of a noble and a valiaunt minde, for that he helde it for moſt certaine, that for as much as they were both ſo priuate with <hi>Commodus,</hi> who did beare him ſo mortall hatred, and comming vnto his houſe at ſuche an houre, might be to no other end then to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his life. And all the time whileſt theſe matters did paſſe betwixt the one and the other parte, <hi>Pertinax</hi> was neither troubled or altered: but after the maner of a man determined to die, ſaide vnto <hi>Letus</hi> and <hi>Electus</hi> theſe woordes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I do well vnderſtande that the Emperour Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus, my Lord, hath ſente to kill me, whereof I doe not meruel: but wonder it is, that ſo long he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered me to liue: becauſe of all the olde ſeruants that were bred with his father Marcus Aurelius I onelie am aliue, a ſmall remnant of all the reſte whiche hee hath ſlaine. I may not with reaſon complaine me, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Commodus in my quietneſſe and ſecuritie doth ſend to put me to death, ſince certaine dayes paſt, I haue atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded this laſt day &amp; houre: for that abhorring, as I did abhorre his wicked life, I was moſte ſure hee
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:3692:112"/>
woulde procure my death. It grieueth me not to die, but for that I die before I ſee my countrie deliuered from the handes of ſo cruell a tyrant: for I ſweare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you by the immortall Godds, that I neuer wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed anie thinge rather vnto my ſelfe, either my poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie, then that it might pleaſe them, before they woulde take away my life I might beholde my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rome ſet at libertie.

You Letus, and Electus, ſeruauntes, friendes, and fauoured with Commodus, doe that whiche he hath commaunded you, and diſpatche mee out of this tedious and miſerable worlde: for in the ende to dye with the ſwoorde, or to dye with an ague, all is but death.</hi>

                  <hi>Oh, howe ſecrete are the iudgementes of God, and howe variable are the thoughtes of menne. This wee ſaye vnto thee Pertinax, becauſe thou thinkeſt that wee are come to take awaye thy life: and wee are not come, but to the ende thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt giue vs life, and take wretched Rome

                  <hi>Wee may not ſpeake or aduertiſe thee at large, for want of time, the breake of day being at hande: but the caſe is thus, that the tyrante Commodus is deade, the cauſe thereof proceeded, for that he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined (as was founde in memoriall written with his owne handes) this day to haue ſlaine vs all: and as by a certaine manner neuer harde of, the matter was diſcouered, we determined to preſerue our own liues, and giue an ende to his tyrannies. In this deed which we haue done, we neither thinke to haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the Gods, or committed treaſon: for that the life of this tyrant was odious vnto the Gods, and daungerous vnto men. It was nowe high time that ſome man ſhoulde giue an ende vnto his life, that had taken away the life of ſo many good men. We, as we were in his fauour, had perfect intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, whom he helde for friends, or enimies: and alſo we knowe right certeinely, that if thou Pertinax be now aliue, it is not, that he ſo wiſhed it, or that he procured not to kil thee, but the Gods gaue him no place, but haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued thee to the ende thou ſhouldeſt deliuer Rome, and reſtore the common wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No man knoweth vnto this houre that Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modus is dead, but Martia and we that haue ſlaine him: and as we haue laide our handes vpon him to finiſhe his dayes, ſo haue we fixed our eyes vpon thee to make thee Emperour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And beleeue vs, Pertinax, that if we coulde haue made choice of any better then thy ſelfe, we woulde haue choſen better: becauſe they are ſo many and ſo greate euills which haue beene committed by this ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that they may not be amended or repayred,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:3692:113"/>
but by the hands of ſome moſt vertuous prince. That which hath moued vs to elect and giue thee this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, is, becauſe thou art auncient, wiſe, valiaunt, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, riche, and of great experience, aboue all the reſt loued &amp; deſired of all the people: for that Prince whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is not acceptable vnto his people, he ſhal of many be diſobeyed &amp; of many much leſſe duely eſteemed.</hi>

Oh <hi>Letus</hi> and thou <hi>Electus,</hi> you ought to be ſatiſfied, ſimply to accompliſh the vniuſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of <hi>Commodus,</hi> without deriſion of theſe my poore auncient yeres, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſay, firſt gilefully to flatter me and afterwards to kill mée. As I haue ſaid, performe that which ye haue to doe, which the ſooner ye ſhall accompliſh, the greater ioy ſhal ye yéeld vnto <hi>Commodus,</hi> and deliuer me of griefe. I well know that <hi>Commodus</hi> now ſléepeth not, but carefully abideth your returne, for at this preſent he atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth no better newes, then the report, that ye haue giuen an end vnto my wretched life. <hi>Letus</hi> and <hi>Electus</hi> conſidering that <hi>Pertinax</hi> continued doubtful and ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, began to ſay and replie: there is ſo ſmall time for ſo great affaires as wée haue to do, that there reſteth no time to contend vpon our ambaſſage and thy ſuſpicion: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou ſhalt ſée the truthe of that which we haue ſaid, and not as thou ſuppoſeſt, take and reade this memoriall, written with <hi>Commodus</hi> his owne hand, and there ſhalt thou ſée, how great reaſon wée had to kill him this night, ſince to morrow he ment to haue ſlaine vs all. <hi>Pertinax</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the memorial into his hands, and knowing it to be <hi>Commodus</hi> writing, found himſelfe placed in the fourth degrée, which is to witt, that on the morrowe <hi>Commodus</hi> would haue killed <hi>Martia, Letus, Electus</hi> and <hi>Pertinax:</hi> &amp; ſo by degrées, many other Senators &amp; Conſuls of <hi>Rome.

againe demaunding if <hi>Commodus</hi> were dead in déede: they aduouched no leſſe, and thoroughly affirmed the ſame: whereuppon hee beganne moſt pitiouſly to wéepe: ſaying, that he wept not for the death of <hi>Commodus,</hi> but becauſe the memorie of the good <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> in him was finiſhed.</q>
And lifting his eyes vp to heauen, ſaid: <hi>Oh vnfortunate Marcus Aurelius, Oh vnfortunate Marcus Aurelius, Oh infortunate Marcus Aurelius:</hi> (thrée times exclaming him to be vnfortunate and vnhappie) <hi>becauſe thou waſt vnfortunate in thy wife, whiche thou poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedſt: in thy daughters which thou nouriſhedſt, &amp; in thy ſonnes which thou begattedſt.</hi>

Neither are the Gods ſo liberall to giue vs al that we deſire, either ſo niggard to denie vs all that we craue: and this they do, becauſe we ſhal acknowledge them to be good, for that which they giue vs: and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The Gods ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ioyntly accompliſhed the deſires of ſo many, as this day they haue accompliſhed all your deſires: for being (as you are) noble, generous, valiaunt, true, and no counterfect Romanes: it is not to be thought that ye ſhould wiſh or deſire, but the libertie of our mother Rome, and the reformation of our auncient common wealthe.</p>
                           <p>Ye haue all ſeene what the Emperour Commodus hath beene, whiche is to witt, howe large in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, howe cruell in killing, howe careleſſe in gouernment, &amp; how filthie of life: through which
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:3692:115"/>
cauſe, we not onely held our houſes as conſumed &amp; loſt, and our perſons in perill, but alſo were defamed throughout all ſtraunge nations. The Prince that is ouer youthly, fooliſh, abſolute or diſſolute, looſeth his people, and defameth his kingdome. Since ye haue ſeene the euils and cruelties which hee hath done, I would haue you ſee, heare, &amp; vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, what he me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to doe: for as it ſeemeth by this memoriall written with his owne hand, hee had a will to haue ſlaine all perſons within the Empire: and if hee might haue brought it to paſſe, it is credible, he would haue cut the throtes of ſo many as be in this world. It was neuer ſeene or heard off in this world, of any tyraunte that hath beene of the maner and condition of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus: for that naturally he delighted in loſſe of friends, and did glorie to haue enimies. Commodus your Emperour is now dead, &amp; if I be not deceiued, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he dieth with conformitie of the whole Empire: becauſe there is nothing more certaine, then that hee which liueth to the preiudice of all men, ſhould die to the conformitie of all men. In as much as the Gods haue taken in good part to deliuer vs from the ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of this tyrant, it is neceſſary that another Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour be prouided and choſen, and this election may indure no delay, but muſt be diſpatched at this inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: becauſe otherwiſe, as the great dignitie of the empire, is a thing that many deſire, &amp; few deſerue: ſo it might happen that at the time wee would beſtowe the ſame vppon ſome vertuous man, it might be vſurped by ſome ſtraunge tyrant. If vnto euery man that is here preſent, we ſhould haue due reſpect, according to their deſeruing: I ſweare by the immortall Gods, wee ſhould want Empires, and not Emperours: but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:3692:115"/>
the Empire is but one, &amp; is not to be giuen but vnto one, in the end none ſhall obteine the ſame, but he vnto whome the Gods ſhall aſſigne, and the deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies permit. The prince that ye haue to electe, ought (in my iudgement) to be natiue of your countrie: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the prince that is not natiue but a ſtraunger, he ſhall rather firſt finiſhe his dayes, then attaine to the loue of his common wealth. Ye haue alſo to elect &amp; chuſe an Emperour, that poſſeſſeth age &amp; grauitie: for that it furthereth not a little the profit and reputation of the common wealth, to haue a beard on the face, &amp; hoarie haires on the head. Alſo it is right neceſſarie in the Emperour which ye ſhal elect, that he be no foole, either a coward: but that he be wiſe, pregnant, noble minded, &amp; of experience: becauſe in naturall ſcience, and long experience, the good gouernement of the whole common wealth doth conſiſt. Manifeſting my minde more clearely, I ſay againe vnto that which I haue ſaid: that if my opinion might be taken in this caſe, we ought to determine and fixe our eyes vppon Publius Pertinax, in whome concurre all the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions aforeſaid: that is to ſay, naturalitie, age, grauitie, ſcience, and experience: &amp; that this is moſt true, there needeth no greater teſtimonie for the credite thereof, then that Commodus held him for his enimie. It is not to be thought, that the Gods in vaine, haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued the life of Pertinax vntil this day, Commodus procuring by a thouſand meanes to put him to death: as it is moſt true, that of al the old ſeruaunts of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by him ſlaine, onely Pertinax is reſerued aliue. As wee haue all wel knowen that be here preſent, that Pertinax hath been the man moſt afflicted, baniſhed, enuied, toyled, and perſecuted, of al the men that now
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:3692:116"/>
are aliue in this world: and ſurely it is a great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to thinke that for him, &amp; for no other the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire hath beene reſerued: becauſe the Gods do neuer preſerue the life of any man amongeſt ſo many pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils, but afterwards greatly they aduaunce him. Wee ought all to hold it for great good hap, and greatly to gratifie the gods in reſpecte of ſuch and ſo many as haue bin ſlaine in our common wealth, that we finde ſuch a prince for our mother Rome, whom they ſhal not aduenture to contemne, becauſe of his grauitie: neither be dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted with feare, for that he is noble min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: either noted of ſimplicitie, in as much, as hee is ſapient: neither accuſed of vice, for that he is vertuous: either reproued of feeblenes, becauſe he is repoſed: fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, no man may deceiue him in words, in ſo much as he hath experience of all thinges. O moſt excellent princes and my commilitants, I will ſay no more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, but that, if ye may perſuade your ſelues to the election of Pertinax, ye ſhall not onely yeeld a good Emperour vnto your Common wealth, but alſo eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man ſhall obteine in him, a father for his familie: for as he hath bin a leader vnto vs all, ſo he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not deale with vs, but as with his children.</p>

               <p>VEry great was the ioy that was manifeſted through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe they had obteyned <hi>Pertinax</hi> for their Lord, and no leſſe was the heauineſſe that <hi>Pertinax</hi> diſcouered, to behold himſelfe an Emperour: for he ſaid, that this name or title of imperie or regiment, was the thing that euery man deſired for himſelf, and in others did moſt abhorre. No ſigne of an Emperour would <hi>Pertinax</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent to accompanie him, vntil he and the Senatours had ſéene, conferred, and ſaluted ech other, and all ioyntly being mounted vpon the height of the <hi>Capitol,</hi> where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> imperial cloth of eſtate was placed, <hi>Pertinax</hi> would by no meane ſit downe in that imperial ſeat, but tooke the Conſul <hi>Glabrio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> by the arme, and by ſtrong hand would haue ſet him in the ſame, ſeriouſly affirming, that it apperteined much better vnto his deſeruing. <hi>Glabrion</hi> was a <hi>Romane,</hi> in age very auncient, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition very mild, in gouernment very wiſe, in life of great ſinceritie, &amp; in bloud much eſtéemed: for that he was deſcended by the right line of king <hi>Aeneas</hi> ſonne vnto <hi>Anchiſes,</hi> and ſonne in lawe vnto king <hi>Priamus,</hi>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:3692:117"/>
and father to <hi>Aſchanius.</hi> When <hi>Glabrion</hi> perceiued <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinax</hi> to perſiſt with ſo great inſtance to inueſt him with the Empire, he ſaid vnto him in the preſence of the whole Senate: the humble humilitie which thou ſheweſt <hi>Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax</hi> in the want of merit of the Empire, the ſame maketh thée of deſeruing ſufficient of the Empire, vnto which elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all wée of the Senate do conſent: not moued thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the election of the armie, but to ſée thée make ſo ſmal accompt of thy ſelfe: in ſuch wiſe, that this thy refuſal yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thy merit ſufficient. A great while was the whole Senat perſuading <hi>Pertinax</hi> to condeſcend to their requeſt, which is to wit, to accept the Empire: but his repugnance was ſo great, that in a manner by force they placed him in the chayre: and that which is more, the whole Senate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, that he did nothing feynedly: for it was lamentable to heare the lamentation which hee made, and to ſée the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of teares which he ſhed. But afterwards, when hée was placed in the imperial chaire, <hi>Pertinax</hi> ſpake vnto the Senate after this maner.</p>

                           <p>THAT which I will now ſpeake vnto you (fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers conſcript) the God Iupiter, in whoſe houſe now we ſtand, be my witnes, I wil not therin deceiue you: for this place being conſecrate vnto the gods (as it is) it ſhould be great ſacrilege, for men to aduenture to lye therein. For all weakneſſe which men commit, they may haue excuſe, except it be for lying: becauſe vnto other vices, humane weakenes doth inuite or intice vs: but to lye, we are not moued but with our owne proper malice. Fathers conſcript, ye ſee how Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus your Emperour is dead, and the deſtinies haue brought to paſſe that I ſucceede him in the Empire: perchance, for as much as he did wiſhe mee euill, and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:3692:117"/>
his workes of my part not very well liked, it may be thought of you, that the manner of his death was firſt notified vnto mee, and his life cut off by my deuice: wherein throughly to ſatiſfie you, I ſweare and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt by the immortall gods, that of this fault I am not guiltie: becauſe I was ſo innocent thereof, that when they ſaid that Commodus was dead, at that inſtant I thought he had ſent to haue ſlaine mee. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that both he and we ſhal all die, I would not that ſo ſtraunge a death ſhould haue finiſhed his dayes: not becauſe Commodus did not deſerue the ſame, but for the great bond which our mother Rome doth owe vnto his father Marcus Aurelius: for it many ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes happeneth, that the errours of the children, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced with the merittes of their fathers. I was ſeruant and aduaunced of the good Marcus Aurelius, which is the greateſt weale that the deſtinies might haue giuen me in this world, &amp; I ſay it is to this end, becauſe it ſhould be great griefe vnto me, if in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence any thing ſhould be ſaid, either in my abſence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing ſhould be done, againſt his ſonne Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, although he be now dead: for that in my heart, I finde my ſelfe much more bound to acknowledge the great goodnes which I receiued of my Lord Marcus Aurelius: then to reueng the iniuries that I ſuffered of his ſonne Commodus. Beleue mee (fathers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcript) that if ye ſhall do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary vnto this which I haue ſaid, it may be, that obſeruing time wherin I ſhall find my ſelfe, it ſhalbe neceſſarie to diſſemble it, but I may not ceaſe greatly to feele it. The prouidence of the gods is farre different from the deuices of men, &amp; that which moueth me to this ſpeach, is, that when I was a yong man, I much deſired the Empire, and might not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:3692:118"/>
it: and now that I am old and do abhorre it, they force mee to take it: in ſuch wiſe, they giue vs that which we hate, and denie vs that which we ſeeke or craue. When I began to hold offices in the common wealth, I thought it moſt certeine, that it was no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine matter, but a diuine dignitie, to be a Romane Emperour: but after I taſted of the trauells of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, and of authoritie, and vnderſtoode the peril to reigne: I did clearely ſee that amongeſt all the trauels of men, to be an Emperour is the greateſt.</p>
                           <p>Neither merueile, either be eſca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dalized (O ye fathers conſcript, to ſee me ſo vntractable, and with ſo many teares to refuſe the Empire: for if I thought to vſe my ſelfe therein as a tyrant, I would not caſte it off, but would rather procure the ſame: but as my meaning is to liue &amp; gouerne more to the profite of the common wealth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the aduancement of mine owne houſe: reſpecting my ſmall ſtrength, the Empire is to mee, a great burthen. Being, as I was, moſt truly ſatiſfied with the acquaintance and conuerſation of the trauels of the Empire, there were no reaſon to think, I ſhould deſire the Empire: becauſe there is none ſo fooliſh, as the man, that with the hope of a remedie, would offer himſelfe vnto an hazard. Vnto this day I haue beene eſteemed in poſſeſſion of great wealth, but now that I am an Emperour, I am forced to become poore: for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a prince, in reſpect of ſuch, with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath to deale and accompliſh, hath fewe thinges to giue, and hath a thouſand neceſſities that conſtreine him to bribe and robbe. Vntil this day I haue had ſome quietneſſe, but from henceforth I ſhalbe conſtreined to liue diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented: becauſe from the trauel and diſquietnes of the prince, peace and quietneſſe doeth proceede vnto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:3692:118"/>
wealth. The office of the prince is not to ſleepe, but to watche: not to be idle, but to trauell: for that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie exceſſiue recreation, which his perſon taketh, forthwith redoundeth to the offence of the common wealth. From my birth vntill this day, of any thing I haue not had greater experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, then to ſee, heare, read, ſuffer, and experiment trauels: wherof many I beheld farre off: but alas of my ſelfe, that nowe am inuironed therewith: becauſe the appetite of the vulgar people is ſo feeble and variable, that if to day they giue and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect a good prince, to morrow they would reliſhe and haue a taſte of the gouernement of ſome other. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turallie, all men, in all thinges, and at all houres, deſire to heare and ſee nouelties, and much more deſire the ſame in the eſtate of gouernement, then in all other thinges: for that no prince gouerneth ſo well, but that they conceiue an other ſhould gouerne better. Vntill this day I haue beene well liked, ſerued, and reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, but from henceforth al men for the moſt part, ſhal beare me enuie and hatred: becauſe the eſtate of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is ſo enuied, that hee ſhall want ſand in the Sea to reckon his enimies: but the number of his fingers of one hand, ſhal exceede to point out his friends.</p>
                           <p>All this I haue ſaid (fathers conſcript) to the end ye ſhall not merueile, why I haue refuſed the burthen of the Empire, but rather am eſcandalized, knowing what I know, to ſee my ſelfe charged and ouer laden with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empire: becauſe to renounce it, a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges do moue me, &amp; to attempt it, nothing inuite me. But ſince the gods haue ſo willed, my deſtinies ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, &amp; ye alſo haue ſo ordeined: I determin to lode my ſelfe with this burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, although I am aſſured it wil coſt me my life: but I yeld it al for wel imployed, if it

               <p>Theſe woordes being ſaid by <hi>Pertinax,</hi> the Senate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued great pleaſure, and chiefly praiſed him, for that hée forbad all men to ſpeake euill of <hi>Commodus,</hi> knowing (as they all did knowe) that hée had béene his mortall enimie. The Senat receiued <hi>Pertinax</hi> in the midſt amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt them, and did accompany and attend vpon him, vnto all the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: and <q>euery temple did offer vnto the Gods, notable
ſacrifices. And moſt truly this was a notable and alſo a laudable cuſtome amongeſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> which is to witt, that princes newly elected, did firſt viſite the Gods, before they permitted themſelues to be viſited of men. As <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinax</hi> had his perſon in ſo great authoritie, and being elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the armie, and the Senat with ſo great concord: and further, being old and hoarie headed, and ſo long time kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen in <hi>Rome,</hi> it was a monſtruous thing to behold, when he came forth into <hi>Rome,</hi> how al men haſted to ſée his face: for truly it ſeemed litle vnto euery man to obey him as a prince, but to loue and ſerue him as a father.</q>

               <head>CHAP. VI. ¶ Of many thinges which he did after he was Emperour.</head>
               <p>THe firſt thing that <hi>Pertinax</hi> commaunded, or prouided, was, that the men of warre were very wel payed: and therwith practiſed great diſcipline, in which matter, more then in any other, he preſently gaue reformation: for that in the Empire of <hi>Commodus,</hi> the armie was abandoned vnto great libertie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modus</hi> conſumed ſo great ſummes of monie in vices, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there was not ſufficient to pay the men of warre: &amp; by this occaſion they did filche by night, rob on high wayes, ſacke houſes, ſpoile corne, oppreſſe the poore, and were bribers with rich men: finally, they were deſperate, and ſo fleſht,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:3692:119"/>
that for feare of any paine, they neuer abſteyned from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Not many dayes after that <hi>Pertinax</hi> was publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Emperour, and with great ſeriouſnes on a certeine day, vſed familiaritie with <hi>Letus</hi> and <hi>Electus,</hi> a Conſul named <hi>Falcus</hi> ſaid vnto him: what an Emperour (O <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinax</hi>) thou ſhalt proue, thy workes begin to make demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration: ſince thou leadeſt after thee <hi>Letus</hi> and <hi>Electus,</hi> which as traytours did kill their Lord <hi>Commodus</hi>: doing what thou doeſt, and conſenting to that wherto thou didſt conſent, it may be no leſſe, beſides the euill example which thou yéeldeſt vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> thou giueſt alſo ſuch ſcruple vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy fame: whereby we thinke, that if thou wert not the inuentour of his death, at the leaſt thou delighteſt to cloke the ſame. Vnto this <hi>Pertinax</hi> made aunſwere, it well ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that although thou be a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſul, thou art but a yong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: ſince thou knoweſt not to make difference of times. It maketh no great matter, that I doe with <hi>Letus</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectus,</hi> as they did with their Lord <hi>Commodus,</hi> that is to ſay, they obeyed him and followed him, and that whiche they moſt deſired, they moſt diſſembled: and at the houre of opportunitie, they diſpatched him of his life. The ſame day that hée was created <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and Emperour, hée was intituled <hi>Pater patriae</hi>: this excellencie vnto none, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſince or before, was giuen vppon that day. His wife was named <hi>Flauia Titiana,</hi> vnto whome likewiſe on the ſame day that he was inueſted <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> ſhe was intituled <hi>Auguſta.</hi> The Emperour <hi>Pertinax</hi> did greatly trauell, to allowe all thinges that his Lord <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> did fauour, to finiſh that which hée had begon, to ſuſteine that which hée had left, to repaire that which he had built and to imitate all that which hée had done: for hée ſaid, it was impoſſible to erre, in following the ſtepps of the good <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Aurelius.</hi> The fame being diuulgate thoroughout the Empire, howe <hi>Commodus</hi> was dead, and <hi>Pertinax</hi> choſen Emperour: the countries, cities, prouinces, and kingdomes, gaue very large rewards vnto the meſſengers thereof, no leſſe for the death of <hi>Commodus,</hi> then for the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:3692:120"/>
election of <hi>Pertinax.</hi> As hée had béene in ſo long time in ſo many prouinces, Pretor, Cenſor, Quirite, Edil, Conſul, Proconſul, and Cenſor, <hi>Pertinax</hi> was one of the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Romanes</hi> in the Empire: whereof ſuccéeded, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Barbarians were aduertiſed, that <hi>Pertinax</hi> was Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſuch as were rebelles, left their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and ſuch as had taken truce, made peace. <hi>Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax</hi> had a ſonne, whome the <hi>Romanes</hi> would haue crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> to the end hée ſhould ſuccéede him after his dayes in the Empire: which he could neuer like off, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto, ſaying: <hi>The Gods neuer graunt, that with the hope of the Empire, my ſonne ſhould be nouriſhed vnto vice and idleneſſe. Commodus</hi> had laide intollerable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtes and tributes vpon his people, which <hi>Pertinax</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to be made fruſtrate: affirming, that of the will <hi>of princes in charging their kingdomes with vniuſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, there ſuccedeth a wilful denial of due and moſt iuſt paiments.</hi> 
                  <q>Falſe witneſſes hee commaunded to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
according vnto the lawe named, <hi>Pena del talion,</hi> that is to ſay, they ſhould be executed by Iuſtice, wherein they had accuſed others by malice. Hée ordeyned that the teſtament which had béen made by the huſband &amp; wiſe ioyntly, might not be altered by the ſuruiuer. Alſo he did ordeyne, that any man dying inteſtate, ſhould not forfett his landes or goods vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fiſcall, but that his ſonne, or moſt néere kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould inherite the ſame: ſaying, there were no reaſon or iuſt lawe, where the dead for want of ſpeach ſhould looſe his goods. The Senators on a day ſaid vnto <hi>Pertinax,</hi> how the Queſtors of the treaſurie, and the officers of the fiſcal, had murmured at him, for the law that he made in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour for the dead inteſtate, vnto whom hee aunſweared: Fathers conſcript, I may ſafely ſay, there are not ſo many that complaine of this lawe, as there be that praiſe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe it: but I recke not whether the one doth praiſe or the other miſlike: but in my iudgement, it is no worke of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> but the inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of tyrants, of robberies, briberies &amp; rapines, to fill the treaſurie with riches.</q>
He made a lawe,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:3692:120"/>
that no fiſcall ſhould ſue anye perſon for landes, or goodes that were doubtfull, ſaying: that the fiſcall ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue nothing that clearely were not his owne: and that in caſe of doubt, more ſure and more conformable vnto iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice were it, to remaine with him that doth poſſeſſe it, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the fiſcall that doth demaunde it. He commaunded all things vniuſtly taken by his predeceſſour <hi>Commodus,</hi> to be reſtoared vnto the owners. When the Secretarie came to firme this lawe to be proclaimed, and <hi>Pertinax</hi> reading the ſame, wherein it was ſaid: <hi>Wee commaunde that all thinges which our predeceſſour Commodus hath robbed,</hi> which word <hi>robbed,</hi> he blotted out with his pen, and enterlined this woord <hi>gotten:</hi> ſaying, it is ſufficient that the lawe be in the fauour of the liuing: without iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, with foule woordes, Princes that be dead. All that which was knowen manifeſtly to be <hi>Commodus</hi> debt, he commaunded to be payed, and all which he had promiſed to be giuen: and beſides all this, the wheat, oyle, and other things which particularly were vſed to be giuen and diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded amongeſt the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> he cauſed with great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to be brought from all kingdomes, and in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance and liberalitie commaunded it to be beſtowed. Many vniuſt tributs being take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away by <hi>Pertinax,</hi> there ſuccéeded a great neceſſitie for the paiment and reliefe of the armie of <hi>Africa</hi>: whereby he was conſtreyned to exact new impoſitions of his common wealth, whereuppon the Conſul <hi>Gelianus</hi> toke occaſion to ſay, that he had done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that which he had begon in the Empire, &amp; againſt that which he had ſaid in the Senat: <hi>Pertinax</hi> aunſwering ſaid. When I was Conſul (as thou art) I did meruaile at the déedes of princes, and now that I am an Emperour, I meruaile of that which you Conſuls do ſpeake: thus much <hi>Gelianus</hi> I ſay to this end, becauſe thou ſhalt vnderſtand, that <hi>Emperours at times, make lawes as they ought, and at other times not as they would, but as they may.</hi>

               <p>THere was in <hi>Rome</hi> and in the confines of <hi>Italie,</hi> much roughe ground for corne, which being barren for want of manuring, <hi>Pertinax</hi> commaunded proclamation to bée made, that if any man would grub, manure, or till y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, hée ſhould fréely for tenne yeares, take the profite thereof. Before <hi>Pertinax</hi> vſed this diligence in <hi>Italie,</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Aegypt, Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Sicyl,</hi> they brought wheat to furniſh the ſame: for which cauſe <hi>Traiane</hi> did vſe to ſay, that <hi>Rome</hi> was more tributarie then any place of the world: for that they could not eate, but if it were giuen them from other king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. <q>There were many particular thinges ſaid to be
the Emperours, namely, hills, heards, garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, riuers, pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and houſes: which hée commaunded to be altered, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them hils, gardens and riuers, not of the Emperour, but of the common wealth, for hée affirmed, that on that day, in which any whatſoeuer, was made Emperour, hée might haue nothing proper vnto himſelfe: and ſaid further, that if this name <hi>Prince</hi> be well vnderſtoode, it giueth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dignitie to the perſon that vſeth the ſame, but to make him defender of the territories of the countrie, and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the common wealthe. In the dayes of his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, they had attempted new impoſitions, that is to ſay, in ports of the ſea, at the ports of cities, for paſſage of high wayes, of barkes vppon riuers, and for baking in ouens: al which were to the great detriment of the common wealth, and the auncient libertie of <hi>Rome:</hi> the collection whereof <hi>Pertinax</hi> from thence forth, commaunded to ceaſſe.</q>
Being demaunded of the Conſul <hi>Tortelius,</hi> why he made fruſtrat lawes ſo profitable, aunſweared: becauſe without compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon much more are the diſpleaſures which they giue me,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:3692:121"/>
then the money which they bring me: and as mée ſéemeth, we may not ſaye, that that money is verie cleanely that comes imbrewed with diſpleaſures. He commaunded that in criminall cauſes, offendours ſhould be verie well hearde: and if in caſe any ſhould dye, fourtie dayes to be expired before he ſhould ſuffer. It was a matter verye monſtruous and ſcandalous, that was conſumed in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, in the dayes of <hi>Commodus:</hi> wherein <hi>Pertinax</hi> in ſuche wiſe prouided, that they murmured no leſſe againſt him for his frugalitie, then againſt <hi>Commodus</hi> for his prodigalitie.
<q>They muche blame <hi>Pertinax,</hi> who ſet before his gueſtes whiche did eate at his table, halfe pigges, and halfe géeſe: and many times ſent two ſoppes betwixt two plates for a preſent, and ſometime the legge of a Pheſant, &amp; at other times the wing of a capon, and reſerued alſo in the morning ſomewhat to be eaten at night. <hi>Princes ought verie muche to conſider, and alſo to auoyde, not to be noted miſerable at their table: for it is verie ſmall that in ſuch trifles may be ſaued, and verie much that they giue vnto the multitude to murmur.</hi>
                  </q>
He many times came foorth vnto the fielde of <hi>Mars,</hi> and there he cauſed the whole armie to exerciſe feates of war, rewarding ſuch as were induſtrious, and reprehendinge ſuch as were dull and harteleſſe. There were many <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,</hi> and others in the confines of <hi>Italie,</hi> whiche did owe great ſummes of money, not onely vnto the fiſcall, but alſo vnto the treaſurie, among whome, ſome in times paſt had béene his friendes, and others that were in great neceſſitie, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded both the one &amp; the other to bee deliuered of the fiſcall, ſince it was due vnto him ſelfe, and made payement of their whole debt that was due vnto the treaſurie.
<q>Amongeſt other vertues, the Emperour <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinax</hi> of twaine was muche noted and praiſed: whiche is to wéete, of clemencie and gratefulneſſe: for that he was pitifull vnto the afflicted, and thankfull vnto his friendes. <hi>Pertinax</hi> had a ſonne, whome, after he was Emperour, he would not permit to come to the court, either as much

as vnto <hi>Rome:</hi> but that he helde him in his countrey, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his owne affaires, and the profite of his owne houſe: whereuppon the Conſul <hi>Fuluius Turbone</hi> ſaide vnto <hi>Pertinax,</hi> that he ſéemed rather the ſonne of a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer, then of an Emperour: he lift vp his eyes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and with a greate ſigh, ſaide: <hi>My mother Rome hath cauſe to be contented, that I offer and put my life in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill for her cauſe, without venturing my ſonne and houſe in like daunger.</hi> Moſt ſurely the ſaying was lamentable, and the more it is conſidered, the more profounde it is: whereby it appeareth, that he helde him ſelf for moſte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, to be eſtabliſhed in the Empire: and that he left his ſonne in greateſt felicitie, to be depriued of the Empire.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Although <hi>Pertinax</hi> were olde and graue, and was placed in the height of the Empire, he alwayes vſed greate vrbanitie towardes all men, in ſuche wiſe that no man did him reuerence, vnto whome he did not vtter ſome courteſie: according to the qualitie of the perſon.
<q>Fiftie ſeruauntes in <hi>Rome</hi> in one night and in one houre, ſlewe their maiſters, for whome the Emperour cauſed ſo diligent ſearche, that onely fiue eſcaped: and the paine that he commaunded they ſhould ſuffer, was, to carrie the dead bodies bounde faſt backe to backe, in ſuche wiſe, that the ſtenche of the dead, did finiſhe the wretched life of the liuing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſchoole where <hi>Pertinax</hi> ſtudied, a certeine <hi>Romaine</hi> named <hi>Valerius</hi> was there alſo a ſtudent, and being alwayes in companie, and of age not much vnlike, and continuing in greate friendſhip, did many times eate with <hi>Pertinax,</hi> which during their repaſt were neuer hearde to talke, but of ſcience, knighthood, repayring of <hi>Rome,</hi> or elſe the reformation of the common wealth.</p>
               <p>It did well appeare in <hi>Pertinax,</hi> that he tooke the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire againſt his will: for truely, neither in his dyet, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his apparell, either in his geſture or ſpéeche, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

in any other thing, did he behaue him ſelfe as an Emperour, in ſuche wiſe, that he preſumed not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent what he was, but what he had béene, He ſaide manie times, that in this worlde he neuer made the like faulte, as when he accepted the Empire: and many times made motion to leaue the ſame, and to returne vnto his houſe: but that he did recomfort him ſelfe with this ſaying: that for as muche as he was of ſo greate age, he might not liue longe, but be deliuered of his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious life.</p>

               <p>AS the Emperour <hi>Pertinax</hi> was olde, ſo was he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the infirmities of olde age: that is to ſaye, with auarice, becauſe in gathering and kéeping of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney he was verie diligent: and in giuing or ſpending ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie dull and vnwilling.</p>
               <p>Alſo he was noted to be a man verie flexible in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires: that is to ſaye, he was not ſtiffe, either greatly did vſe therein any contradiction, but that which one did counſell him, another might eaſily perſuade the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye: the cauſe whereof was his good naturall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whiche coulde not without griefe, beholde any man that was in ſorrowe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:3692:123"/>Alſo <hi>Pertinax</hi> was noted, that he neuer denied any thing that was demaunded, although many his promiſes were neuer perfourmed: for, at moſte times he promiſed to giue that which was impoſſible to be accompliſhed. <hi>And becauſe the maieſtie and greateneſſe of Princes doth conſiſt to haue and poſſeſſe, whereof to giue: they ought much to be aduertiſed in conſideration, what is craued of them, and what they promiſe: for hauing to do (as they haue) with ſo manie, and to furniſhe ſo infinite neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: they ought, if their ſubiectes be vnſhamefaſt in cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, to be graue in promiſing. Ioyntly with this, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought to be aduertiſed, that where they haue once ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their royall worde, all things ſet aparte, they ought to perfourme the ſame. Pertinax</hi> was twiſe married, his ſeconde marriage was with the daughter of <hi>Vulpitianus,</hi> whome he made prefecte when he was made Emperour. As concerning the vnchaſtitie of his wife, alſo <hi>Pertinax</hi> was noted: whiche is to wéete, of negligence in gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and remiſſe in reprehending her, for that truely ſhée was both young and faire, abſolute and diſſolute: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in <hi>Rome,</hi> to be more enamoured with a young Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician then with <hi>Pertinax</hi> her olde huſbande. Alſo <hi>Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax</hi> was much noted to haue vſed vnlawfull loue with <hi>Cornificia</hi> his néere kinſwoman, whome he had nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from her childhood: for ſhée was committed by her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto his protection: this matter was no leſſe ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous then foule and no leſſe foule, then ſcandalous: for that ſuche like, and ſo great euill, was not conuenient to a man of ſo greate age, either permiſſible in a Prince of ſo great grauitie. <q>Some prodigious and ſtraunge ſignes
appeared before his death, eſpecially on a time, offering certeine ſacrafices vnto the Goddes <hi>Penates,</hi> that when the coales were moſte kindled and on fire, ſoudeinly they were ſéene all dead and quenched: whiche did ſignifie, that in the greateſt certeintie of his life, ſoudeinly death ſhould aſſaile him.</q>

of <hi>Iupiter</hi> he was offering great ſacrifices, with his own handes he offered a Pecocke, wherein he found no hearte when it was opened, and ſoudeinely the head vaniſhed, when the throate was cutt. Eight dayes before he was ſlaine, a Starre ioyned with the Sunne, and did ſhine at noone dayes, as if it had béene midnight. Thrée dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was ſlaine, <hi>Pertinax</hi> dreamed that he fell into a fiſhepond: and that there was a man with an huge knife to kill him, and woulde haue fled and could not. <hi>Iulianus</hi> whiche after ſuccéeded <hi>Pertinax</hi> in the Empire, hauing a Nephewe newe married vnto his Néece, and hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired vnto <hi>Pertinax</hi> to viſite him, <hi>Pertinax</hi> ſaide vnto the young married man: <hi>be good, and I ſhall holde and eſteeme thee as my ſonne: ſerue thy vncle Iulianus as a father, becauſe he is my fellowe in office and ſucceſſour.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. IX. Of the occaſion that the Pretorians tooke to murther him.</head>
               <p>THE officers that <hi>Commodus</hi> vſed for his ſeruice in court, as Chamberlaines, Secretaries, maiſters of houſholde, clarkes of the kitchin, porters, cookes, and ſuch other, <hi>Pertinax</hi> had not chaunged, ſtaying that chaunge vntil the daye of celebration of the buylding of <hi>Rome:</hi> for he helde opinion, that before the euil ſhoulde be remoued, it were greate reaſon, at leaſure to make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of others that were good. That which <hi>Pertinax</hi> had thought to haue done in his houſe, he determined alſo to execute amongeſt the captaines of warres, and other officers of the common wealth, becauſe they were ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in commaunding, and ſo couetous in robbing, that if the paine were recompenced with the fault, it had béene a ſmall matter, from euery one of them to haue taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way life.</p>
               <p>When affaires of importaunce are deferred, the ſecreat thereof incurreth greate daunger: and for this cauſe, as <hi>Pertinax</hi> deferred this matter from day to day, all officers ſuſpected what he woulde do with them, and therfore determined to diſpatche him of his life. Extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was <hi>Pertinax</hi> hated of the men of warre, and of the particular officers of the common wealth: which hatred procéeded not of any iuſt offence, done by this good Prince, but for that he conſented not that they ſhould robbe &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte vile déedes. <hi>Many times the wicked beare enuie vnto the good, not becauſe the vertuous ſuffer them to do well, but for that they conſent not vnto them to do euill: for ſo peruerſe is the malice of ſome peruerſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that they take more delight to do euil vnto others,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:3692:124"/>
then to receiue benefite vnto them ſelues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vnto all the officers of the common wealth, <hi>Pertinax</hi> commaunded that they ſhoulde enioye intierly all fées and profites appertaining vnto their offices: and vnto all the Pretors, and ſouldiers of the warres, he prouided their wages very well paide them: and beſides all this he dealte not with them as with vaſſals, but the chiefteines he did honour as brethren, and to meaner perſones he ſpake as vnto his ſonnes: but all this notwithſtanding, they liued in greate paſſion, and no leſſe diſcontented: for that in times paſt, their extraordinarie robberies were muche more then their wages. But thus was the caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>On a daye, certeine Pretors of the armies did aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at a dinner, with other officers of the citie, as alſo diuers ſeruitours of the courte: and after they had lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gely eaten, and aboundantly drunken, they beganne to talke of the dayes of <hi>Commodus:</hi> that is to ſaye, howe then they were at libertie, riche, and honoured: and now ſince <hi>Pertinax</hi> reigned, they were poore, captiues, and defaced: and that the faulte thereof conſiſted more in their owne cowardiſe, then in any other perſon. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther procéeding in this matter, they concluded to ſpoile <hi>Pertinax</hi> of his life, and to chooſe another Emperour of <hi>Rome</hi> at their liking, which ſhoulde renewe the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of their Lorde <hi>Commodus,</hi> and violate all actes that <hi>Pertinax</hi> had confirmed: and that it was a more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer waye to bee gouerned by a wiſe young man like <hi>Commodus,</hi> then by an olde dotyng foole, as <hi>Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax.</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>Partely, for that they had their heades troubled with drinke, and their ſtomaches hoate with eating, but aboue all the reſt, furiouſly inflamed with talke, ſoudeinly they roſe all from the boorde, and euery man goeth home to be armed, with a determination to dye in that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe: or, that ſame daye to diſpatche <hi>Pertinax</hi> of his life.</q>

               <p>IF this ſo greate commotion, whiche this day ye haue raiſed (O my friendes and commilitants) be for that I ſeeme not woorthy of the Empire of Rome: ye haue to remember, that I neither ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the ſame by ſuite or requeſt, either bought it for money, but that forceably ye made me to take it, I of my parte imploying my forces to reſiſt it. And if it be, for that I haue had no regard vnto the common wealth, yee knowe howe ofte I haue requeſted to ceaſe from gouernement, and to departe vnto my houſe: and ſince this is moſte true, I knowe not to what end ye ſhoulde remoue me perforce from that whiche I woulde haue lefte and remitted with greate good will. And if for that I haue beene ingrate vnto my mother Rome, or haue vſed euill gouernement in the common wealth, ye will take away my life, then I cannot but confeſſe it to be a worke moſt iuſt, albeit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>I</hi> ſhoulde be purſued, not onely with paine and griefe, but alſo with infamie: becauſe ſuche a death yealdeth more paine and ſhame to deſerue it, then to ſuffer it. And if ye thinke your ſelues diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced, to haue a Prince that is not deſcended of the Fabians, of the Metells, of the Fabritians, or

               <p>His graundfather was named <hi>Salbius Iulianus,</hi> who gaue him ſelfe more to armes, then to letters: and went vnto the warres of <hi>Datia</hi> with <hi>Traiane,</hi> and was captaine of the ſeconde Legion, and longe time diuider of the victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, and in the ende dyed in his office, that is to ſay, in the warres againſt kinge <hi>Dacus.</hi> His father was named <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius Petronius,</hi> who neither gaue him ſelfe to ſcience, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther folowed the warrs as his predeceſſours, but was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidente and liued alwayes in <hi>Rome,</hi> folowing his affaires, and holdinge offices in the common wealth: hee was an

The firſt office that <hi>Didius Iulianus</hi> did beare in the common wealth, was Decemviriato, which is to wéete, to be one of the x. viſitours of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people: and though he wanted age to vſe it, yet he wanted not fauour to obteine it, becauſe <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitia,</hi> mother vnto <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> did craue this office for him in the Senate.

               <p>
                  <hi>Iulianus</hi> was Edil, Pretor, and Cenſor diuerſe times, diuers yeares, and at times muche diſtant: but the office wherein he continued longeſt time, was <hi>Romane</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: becauſe he had learning to gouerne, and iuſtice to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute.

               <p>He gouerned by the ſpace of three yeares, the prouince of <hi>Belgica,</hi> whiche nowe is named <hi>Swetia,</hi> in which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, he behaued him ſelfe ſo venturouſlie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined what he had loſt in the warre, which is to ſay, much reputation in the common wealth, and greate goodes for his houſe.</p>

When the Senate had intelligence what <hi>Iulianus</hi> had done in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the Emperoure thoughte him ſelfe therein verie well ſerued, and the Senate no leſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented: chieflie, for that ſo exactlie hee had perfourmed the ſame, without requeſte or commaundemente: and in recompence of this ſo ſingular a ſeruice, they ſent him the Conſulſhippe, without his requeſte, or anie other to ſolicite the ſame. When the newes of Conſulſhipe came vnto <hi>Iulianus,</hi> they ſaye that he ſaide: <hi>I ſweare by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall Godes, that I neither ſolicited the Conſulſhip, either thought to haue obteined the ſame: but here in it clearelie appeareth, that the good dothe more ſolicite with his good woorkes, then the euill with his manie guiles.</hi>

At one time <hi>Iulianus</hi> was in fauour with <hi>Commodus,</hi> &amp; an other time in diſgrace: but after that he was accuſed of conſpiracie, he did allwayes beare him mortall hatred: and when he vnderſtoode this in <hi>Commodus,</hi> both in worde and deede, moſte times he kéept his houſe and

excuſed him ſelfe from the offices of the common wealth.
<q>
                     <hi>Iulianus</hi> was a lawyer, and in letters moſte learned: of whome it is ſaid, that fewe did ſurpaſſe him in ſcience, and none was equall vnto him in eloquence: for hee did neuer pleade anie cauſe in the Senate, but he obteined the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. He was prompt in ſpeache, ſharpe in propounding, and graue in determination, of ſtature ſomewhat lowe, of ſanguine complexion, and in his youth beganne to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reheaded: of whome in this caſe it may be ſaide, that hee was a monſter in nature: for that he had neuer a white haire in his bearde, either anie blacke haire in his heade. His wife was named <hi>Malia Eſcantilia,</hi> and had but one daughter named <hi>Didia Clara.</hi> In this alſo as in the other, nature woulde be extreme: becauſe the mother was the moſte foule woman that had bene ſeene in <hi>Rome,</hi> and the daughter was the faireſt dame, that euer was ſéene in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>

               <p>AT the inſtante that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pretorian bandes had ſlaine the Emperour <hi>Pertinax,</hi> they aduiſed to ioyne in one, to ſeaze the walles, to take the gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that with an armed power: partelie for that the people ſhould not riſe againſt them, as alſo to chooſe an Emperour at their owne liking. Although the common people behelde the imperiall palace beſette, yet they did not thinke that they woulde haue ſlaine the Emperour: becauſe the fame went amongſt them, that <hi>Pertinax</hi> was come foorth, and that with milde wordes he had intreated them: but as it after chaunced, though the greate troupes were retyred, <hi>Pertinax</hi> was ſlaine by the fewer number. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of <hi>Pertinax</hi> was notified vnto the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people, al <hi>Rome</hi> was readie in armour.

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:3692:130"/>
were all faultie in that facte, the one in the acte, the other for conſent.</p>
               <p>The moſte principall of the Senate, manie matrones of <hi>Rome,</hi> moſte wealthy perſons, and ſuch as loued peace and quietneſſe, after that they ſawe the walles beſette, the towers taken, the gates lockt, and the ſtreetes ſtopte through out al <hi>Rome,</hi> they departed vnto their inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, vntill they might ſee the concluſion of that ſo perilous &amp; ſcandalous a tumulte: for they had had experience, that no man might be ſafe in his houſe, vntill there were a new Emperour: and that the election of him, ſhoulde be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated with the handes of manie perſons. The Pretorian bandes beholding the moſte parte of the people to be fled, and none lefte that durſte reuenge the death of <hi>Pertinax,</hi> or reſiſte their attempts: they loſt al feare, and recouered a newe courage, not to amende the fault whiche they had committed, but to giue and ſell the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire. The caſe was thus, that a man at armes mounted vpon the wall at the gate <hi>Salaria,</hi> who in the name of the whole armie made proclamation, and ſaide with a loude voice: <hi>Is there anie man that will giue more for the Empire of Rome? is there anie man that will ſet a price? for vnto him that will giue moſt money, we will giue it for his owne.</hi> Of all the iniuries, diſgraces, and calamities, that the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> the <hi>Asſyrians,</hi> the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> the <hi>Gothes</hi> &amp; the <hi>Lombards</hi> did vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> none was equal vnto this, which is to ſay, to ſet the greatneſſe and maieſtie of <hi>Rome</hi> in open ſale.

               <p>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:3692:131"/>Al the gentlemen, auncient <hi>Romanes,</hi> and Senatours, coulde not fill or ſatiſfie them ſelues with wéeping, when they behelde and hearde the proclamations made out at windowes: and that which did more grieue them, was the greate infamie whiche allwayes ſhoulde followe <hi>Rome,</hi> in that ſhée was ſet to ſale: and of the daunger alſo of the common wealth, which was to be bought of ſome tyrante. Thoſe that woulde haue bought the Empire, had no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, for that <hi>Commodus</hi> had ouerviewed and ranſackt their ſtore: and thoſe that coulde haue bought, of greate griefe and no leſſe ſhame, woulde not deale therein: for in reſpect of the iniurie that they ſhould haue committed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their mother <hi>Rome,</hi> it might not be ſaide, that they bought it for money, but ſolde it vnto ſome enimie. In concluſion the ſegniorie of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the greatneſſe and maieſtie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empire, paſſed in publique proclamations, by the ſpace of three dayes, in whiche no man woulde buye it, or ſette it in price: in ſo muche as the Pretorians were deſpited that no man would giue money, and the common people in greate ſadneſſe that they woulde ſell it. The fourth day after <hi>Pertinax</hi> was ſlaine, as <hi>Didius Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus</hi> was at ſupper with greate pleaſure, and talking howe the Empire continued in proclamations, his wife, daughter, and ſonne in lawe perſuading him to adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture to buy it ſince the Pretorians were growne to ſo great wante of ſhame as to ſell it. <hi>Iulianus</hi> conſideringe of the one parte what was ſaide by proclamation, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parte, what his friendes did perſuade him, left his eating, caſt downe his heade, and gaue him ſelfe profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to conſider of the matter, whiche is to wéete, whether it were ſimplicitie to leaue, or vilanie with money to buy the common wealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iulianus</hi> being verie penſatiue with him ſelfe, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, his wife, daughter, and kinſfolke, yet againe replied, ſaying, that it was not nowe time to blinde him ſelfe with ſtudie, but to profite him ſelfe by his money: and that alſo he had to conſider, that it were leſſe euill to buy
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:3692:131"/>
the Empire with his owne proper money, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as other, to obteine the ſame by loſſe of mens liues: and that he ſhoulde not care to deferre the euente by delayes, ſince the Pretorians grewe diſpleaſed, and proclamations to be cut off. As <hi>Iulianus</hi> naturally was proude, founde him ſelfe riche, and alſo importunated by his friendes, he determined to buy the Empire: and for the purpoſe preſently goeth to the foote of the wall, and crieth out vnto the watch that was thereon, ſaying: for bloud, ye knowe me to be deſcended of noble <hi>Romanes,</hi> and in riches moſt wealthy: and that he woulde giue them ſo muche money for the Empire, that they ſhoulde be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to ſée it, and tyred to tell it. The Conſul <hi>Sulpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> father in lawe vnto the Emperour <hi>Pertinax,</hi> in ſecrete did ſolicite the Pretorians to giue him the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, not to the ende he woulde buy it, but that they ſhoulde electe him: but the Pretorians although they ſawe that he was a noble <hi>Romane,</hi> and not vnworthy, but verie conuenient for the Empire, they durſte not put them ſelues into his handes, doubting that he afterwardes remembring the death of his ſonne <hi>Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax,</hi> would execute on them ſome rigorous reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Sulpitius</hi> was a man wiſe and ſapient, repoſed, and auncient: with the good wil of the Senate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the people, to him and no other woulde they haue giuen the Empire: and doubtleſſe had it not béene for the aliaunce which he had with <hi>Pertinax,</hi> who was his ſonne in lawe, they woulde rather haue giuen it him franckely for nothinge, then haue ſolde it vnto the other for money. The Pretorians being muche deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they might not receiue money for the Empire, ſince foure dayes they had proclamed the ſale thereof, and nowe finding <hi>Iulianus</hi> at the foote of the wall, who had offered money for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empire, they put downe a lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and toke him vp vnto them.

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:3692:132"/>
more then he poſſeſſed, and hee did offer more then hee had. The caſe was thus: that they with him, and he with them, did capitulate iiii. thinges, whereof none was to the honour of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; much leſſe to the profite of the common wealth. <q>Their firſte capitulation was, that he ſhould giue them preſently 300000. ſextercies:
the ſecond was, that he ſhoulde neither reuenge the death, or ſuſtaine the fame of the Emperour <hi>Pertinax:</hi> the third was, that he ſhould erect y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> picture, &amp; renewe the memorie of <hi>Commodus:</hi> the fourth was, that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie they might do, vnder his Empire, as they had done in the dayes of <hi>Commodus:</hi> in ſuch wiſe, that <hi>Iulianus</hi> did not onelie buy the Empire for money, but alſo gaue them licence to liue wickedlie. This donne and concluded, the euent of the Empire was ſtopt in <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus,</hi> the Pretorians receiuing him in the mids, and attending him throughout all the citie, publiſhinge with loude voices, <hi>Long life be euer vnto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Iulianus, Commodus alwayes Auguſtus.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Iulianus</hi> being created Emperour, his firſt act was, to offer vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptuous ſacrifices: being (as it was) the cuſtome of all newe <hi>Romane</hi> Emperours, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye he ſent vnto his treaſurie for money, to pay them of whom he had bought the Empire. It was a monſtruous matter to ſée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iuels that he brought forth, &amp; the diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of money which he had: the cauſe therof was, that he

Al men bewayled the caſe with manie teares, and offered vnto their Gods many ſacrifices, humbly praying that it might pleaſe them, ſhortlie to take away the life of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus,</hi> &amp; to execute cruel vengeance on y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> murderers of <hi>Pertinax.</hi> On a certaine time <q>the Circen playes beeing
prepared, and the ſeate emperiall placed aloft vpon the Theater, when the Emperour <hi>Iulianus</hi> ſhoulde haue ſet, certaine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people raſhly not only did remoue it, but alſo did breake it in péeces: and he as he was wiſe and aduiſed did féele it as a man, and did diſſemble it as one that was diſcrete. Beſides that whiche they ſayd in his abſence, they deſpiſed him in his preſence: and he happened manie times to heare with his owne eares, wordes not a little ouerthwarte and iniurious: but he was ſo ſubtile in that whiche he ſaide, and no leſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling in that whiche he hearde, that all the iniuries whiche they ſaide or did, either he toke them in leſte, or did counterfete, not to heare them.</q>
Naturally <hi>Iulianus</hi> was a prince of greate vrbanitie, that is to ſay, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, affable, gratious, and pleaſaunt, and did honoure &amp; reuerence euery man according to the merit of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon &amp; the eſtate which he held: yet notwithſtanding, he could neither get frinds, either apeaſe enimies. <q>Neither

When they ſawe his horſſe paſſe the ſtréetes where on hee

did vſe to ride, generally they would praye vnto the Gods that he might traile him: or if they had ſéene his meates carried, they did wiſhe it might choke him: finally, they did all abhorre his life, &amp; wiſhed his death. <hi>Iulianus</hi> his enimies bruted among the people, that on the daye, when the Pretorians had ſlaine <hi>Pertinax,</hi> he had made a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and curious banket, wherein he gaue to eate oyſters of the <hi>Adriatike</hi> Seas, Capons of <hi>Capua,</hi> wine of <hi>Creete,</hi> and water of <hi>Cantabria:</hi> but aboue all, had Muſicke and daunceing after dinner.</q>
Others ſaide, it was moſt falſe, but on that day he kept his houſe, and of pure ſorrowe to ſée <hi>Pertinax</hi> ſlaine, did not eate, vntil they had giuen a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulture vnto the dead bodie. Moreouer they ſaye, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Iulianus</hi> was gladſome, pleaſant, and alſo vicious, yet he did not excéede in extraordinarie expences, and that it was vnlikely and alſo impoſſible, for him to haue made ſo ſumptuous a banket: for it was many times no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious vnto al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he did eate in his houſe no other fleſh by the ſpace of iii. dayes, but on Hare, whiche was ſent him.
<q>He was ſuch a miſer to ſpend, &amp; ſo deſirous to hoord and lay vp money, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had it not béene for ſome dayes of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, or his bidden gueſts, not a morſel of fleſh was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his houſe: but only fed of his prouiſion from his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</q>
Many euil cuſtomes that <hi>Pertinax</hi> had remoued from the common wealth, brought in by <hi>Commodus,</hi> he conſented y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Pretorians &amp; other vicious perſons ſhould vſe them: not that he delighted therein, but to recouer them to be his friendes. At all times when talke was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of his predeceſſour <hi>Pertinax,</hi> he would ſay neither good nor euil, but that either he changed into ſome other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or elſe by diſſimulation would ſéeme not to heare. And being demaunded, why he did neither alowe or condemne that which was ſaide of <hi>Pertinax</hi> in his preſence: he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, of the one parte <hi>Pertinax</hi> was ſo holy, that there was not in him to be reprehended: and of the other parte, he was ſo hated of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pretorians, that he durſt not in their preſence giue him his due commendation.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IIII. ¶Of two Romaine Capteines named Seuerus and Peſſenius that rebelled againſt the Emperour Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus.</head>
               <p>AT the time that <hi>Iulianus</hi> bought the empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> there was a Pretor of the armies in <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> named <hi>Peſſenins Niger:</hi> who although he was inferiour vnto <hi>Iulianus</hi> in wealth, yet in vertue he excéeded <hi>Iulianus:</hi> this <hi>Peſſenius</hi> was a man, groſſe, rough, and of greate courage, and naturally was more happie in martiall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, then fortunate in the gouernement of the common wealth: all which procéeded, for that in periles he was not daunted with feare, and in trauels had no patience. At the firſt letters that <hi>Peſſenius</hi> receiued from <hi>Iulianus,</hi> they ſaye, he aunſwered: the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, doth not vſe to ſuffer it ſelfe to be gouerned by ſo euil a man, as is <hi>Iulianus:</hi> wherefore, if this commaundement be onely from the Emperour, I obey it: but if it be <hi>Iulianus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, I appeale from it: wherupon it followed, that from thenceforth, when any commaundement was ſent vnto <hi>Peſſenius</hi> from <hi>Rome, Iulianus</hi> name was not in the firme thereof, but onely ſuperſcribed with the Emperour of <hi>Rome.</hi> After this matter was diſcouered, in <hi>Rome,</hi> they laide great wagers, which was moſt to be praiſed, the minde of <hi>Peſſenius</hi> for his haughtie attempt, or the patience of <hi>Iulianus</hi> that could diſſemble the ſame. Alſo at that time the armies were gouerned in <hi>Illyria,</hi> by a capteine named <hi>Septimius Seuerus,</hi> borne in <hi>Africa,</hi> and bred in <hi>Rome,</hi> which in iuſtice was verie right, in condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſharpe, and in martial affaires moſt fortunate. This <hi>Septimius Seuerus</hi> from the houre he had intelligence of the death of the Emperour <hi>Pertinax,</hi> and that in his place ſuccéeded <hi>Iulianus,</hi> would neither receiue letter,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:3692:134"/>
either obey commaundement, that came from <hi>Iulianus,</hi> either elſe from the Senate: ſaying, that they for conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and he for buying the Empire, were inabilitate of all power to commaund or to gouerne: and further, an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil friend was <hi>Iulianus</hi> vnto <hi>Pertinax,</hi> that ſold his bloud vnto enimies, and bought his Empire for money. But the caſe was thus, that <hi>Peſſenius</hi> in <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and <hi>Seuerus</hi> in <hi>Illyria,</hi> reuolted with all their armies againſt <hi>Iulianus:</hi> whereof being aduertiſed, they ſaye that he ſaid: the gods be pleaſed to retaine in my ſeruice, all ſuch as be in peace: ſmall is my care, if the reſt had taken their leaue. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Iulianus</hi> ſaide thus much openly, ſecretely he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the contrarie, which was afterwardes better kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen by his works which he did, then by the words which he ſaide. If <hi>Seuerus</hi> had deadly hatred vnto <hi>Iulianus,</hi> moſte ſurely <hi>Iulianus</hi> was not in loue with <hi>Seuerus:</hi> for preſently, when he vnderſtood that he had rebelled againſt him, he framed and brought to paſſe in the Senate, that <hi>Seuerus</hi> was proclaimed a publique enimie of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all his armie diſpatched and condemned. The Senate prouided at the requeſt of <hi>Iulianus,</hi> that <hi>Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinus Candidus,</hi> a man both olde &amp; a Conſul ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte to <hi>Aſſyria</hi> &amp; <hi>Illyria:</hi> which was not onely diſobeyed in the armies, but alſo not ſo much as heard: the cauſe therof was, the infamous Ambaſſage which he brought: &amp; becauſe afore time, he was much hated being a Pretor in the warres. After <hi>Veſpertinus</hi> was returned vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> they ſent againe vnto <hi>Illyria, Valerius Catulus,</hi> but to ſmall purpoſe: for if they diſobeyed the prouiſions of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didus,</hi> at <hi>Valerius</hi> they ran with lances. <hi>Candidus</hi> &amp; <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius</hi> being returned to <hi>Rome, Iulianus</hi> and the Senate ſent againe <hi>Aquilius Centurius,</hi> who had comaundement to kil <hi>Seuerus,</hi> &amp; that by any manner y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might: that is to ſay, either fighting w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him in the field, or ſecretely to giue him poiſon. <hi>Seuerus</hi> being aduiſed, howe the Emperour <hi>Iulianus</hi> and the Senate had ſent the third time <hi>Aquilius</hi> againſt him, determined to bring foorth his armies
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:3692:135"/>
from <hi>Illyria,</hi> and to come to <hi>Rome</hi> to ſéeke <hi>Iulianus:</hi> and marched with ſo greate ſpéede vppon the way, that when <hi>Aquilus</hi> came foorth of <hi>Rome, Seuerus</hi> was then in the confines of <hi>Italie.</hi> Incredible was the feare that fell on y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Romanes,</hi> after they vnderſtood that <hi>Seuerus</hi> was come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them with all his armies: and their terrour was increaſed, to conſider that he was a capteine of <hi>Rome,</hi> which vntil that time, had béene a defender of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, and alſo for that he had made ſo great ſpéede vpon the way, and leade his armies with ſo great reformation, that in one and the ſelfe ſame day, they heard of his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall, and alſo behelde him in the face. The <hi>Capuans</hi> ſent a ſolemne ambaſſage vnto <hi>Seuerus,</hi> to be aduertiſed of the purpoſe of his iourney, and to offer him their help and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance: whome <hi>Seuerus</hi> receiued with great benignitie, and ſaide theſe wordes in greate ſecrecie. <hi>I come not to deſtroye Italie, either haue I taken armour to go againſt my mother Rome: the ende of my comming is for three thinges: which is to weete, to reſcue the Empire from the tyrant Iulianus, to reuenge the death of the Emperour Pertinax, that was old &amp; honourable, &amp; to refourme the Senate, of ſuch as dare amongeſt them to aduenture to giue euil counſel: for that I conceiue to ſerue my common wealth no leſſe, in clenſing vices, then defending enimies.</hi> That which <hi>Seuerus</hi> ſaide vnto the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pua</hi> in ſecrete, preſently they diſcouered openly: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnderſtood in <hi>Rome,</hi> the Senatours receiued thereof greate ſorrowe, and the people greate pleaſure: becauſe the one did hope to attaine libertie, and the other did feare chaſticement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iulianus</hi> gathered all his men of warre, to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of his power, and ſent them againſt <hi>Seuerus,</hi> vnder the conduction of <hi>Tullius Criſpinus:</hi> the which, after he was aduertiſed that <hi>Seuerus</hi> had taken <hi>Rauenna,</hi> and all the countrie adioyning, returned vnto <hi>Rome:</hi> which feminine acte gaue diſmaye vnto <hi>Iulianus,</hi> and courage vnto <hi>Seuerus.</hi>

               <p>With greate inſtance <hi>Iulianus</hi> requeſted the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that they with the Prieſtes and veſtall virgins would méete <hi>Seuerus</hi> and his armie with proceſſion, to ſée if they might pacifie with prayers whome they might not reſiſt with armes. This ſuite the Conſul <hi>Fauſtius</hi> reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, ſaying, that it were not conuenient, that the ſacred Senate, either the Prieſtes of the temples, or the holie veſtall virgins, ſhould intend matters of warre: for the office of ſuch was to ſolicite the Gods to giue vs peace: and further, the Conſul <hi>Fauſtius</hi> ſaide: <hi>he that poſſeſſeth an Empire, and knoweth not to defend an Empire, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the indignitie of an Empire.</hi> This anſwere was no leſſe diſpleaſant vnto <hi>Iulianus,</hi> then pleaſant vnto the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours, whereby he obteined not, that which he deſired, and they grewe vnbridled to ſpeake at large. <hi>Iulianus</hi> not contented with that which was done, but called in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret certeine his capteines and friendes, whome he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded ſoudeinly to enter armed into the Senate, and to ſaye vnto the Senatours, that of two thinges they had to make choyce, that is to ſay: to loſe their liues, or elſe to obey his commaundementes.

Iulianus</hi> chaunging his conceite, practiſed with the Senate, that he woulde yelde vp the Empire vnto whome it might pleaſe them: which they liked verie well, but durſt not at that preſent to debate therein: for <hi>Seuerus</hi> at that time was ſo neare vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> that it was rather in his handes to take the Empire, then to receiue it at the handes of the Senate. <hi>Iulianus</hi> forgate not to ſende his Capteine <hi>Criſpinus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Seuerus:</hi> againſt whome, <hi>Seuerus</hi> ſent another capteine named <hi>Iulius Lucius,</hi> who ouercame in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, and ſlewe <hi>Criſpinus.</hi>

And (as they after reported which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) he him ſelfe chaunged countenaunce, and with ſtaring hayres, diſcouered him ſelf to be in great terrour. <hi>Iulianus</hi> came vnto the Senatours, crauing their aduiſe, howe he ſhould prouide and behaue him ſelfe: for that <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerus</hi> approched, and fauoured of Fortune, who had him in contempt.</p>

The father in lawe of <hi>Iulianus</hi> was named <hi>Aratmenſis,</hi> whome <hi>Iulianus</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded and requeſted to take halfe the Empire, in ſuche wiſe, that bothe ſhould haue béene intituled Emperours of <hi>Rome:</hi> and ioyntly therewith ſware and affirmed, that he did it not to remedie the neceſſitie wherein he ſtoode: but for greate good wil which he did beare him: who aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, this which thou ſayeſt, <hi>Iulianus,</hi> be thou aſſured, that I will neither do it, either do I loue, but yrketh mée to heare it: becauſe to gouerne the Empire I am blinde, to traueile I am weake, and to inioye it am become olde: and much more reſpecting the age which I poſſeſſe, and the trauels which I haue paſſed: I am more apte to make peace with the Gods, then to take warres in hande againſt men.</p>
               <p>All the men of warre that were in <hi>Etruria,</hi> did paſſe vnto the ſeruice of <hi>Seuerus,</hi> whome he would not by any meanes receiue, vntil they had ſworne to be innocent of the death of <hi>Pertinax. Seuerus</hi> at the breake of the day, diſcouered him ſelfe with all his armies, two leagues from <hi>Rome:</hi> whiche being knowen vnto the Senate, ioyntly they agréed to determine two thinges: whiche is to wéete, to remoue <hi>Iulianus</hi> from the Empire, and to depriue him of his life, and in his place to elect <hi>Seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> Emperour.</p>
               <p>Then one of the Senatours came foorth from the Senate, and publiſhed with open voice vnto the people,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:3692:137"/>
that they ſhould hold it for certeine, that by the authoritie of the ſacred Senat, <hi>Iulianus</hi> was depriued of the Empire, and in his ſtéede <hi>Seuerus</hi> elected Emperour.
<q>Great was the ioy that the people receiued, when they heard <hi>Iulianus</hi> to be depriued of the Empire: and preſently at the inſtant who beſt might, made moſt haſt to receiue the newe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour: and none paſſed by <hi>Iulianus</hi> houſe, that threw not ſtones at the windowes, and ſpat not vppon the walles. At the houre that the Senate went forth to receiue <hi>Seuerus,</hi> they ſent a Gentleman to kill <hi>Iulianus,</hi> who expreſſing the ſorrowful ambaſſage which he brought, with many teares <hi>Iulianus</hi> requeſted that he might not be ſlaine, before hee had ſéene <hi>Seuerus:</hi> but the gentleman durſt do no leſſe, then to cut off his head, becauſe the Senate ſtayed at the porte <hi>Salaria,</hi> and had ſworne not to procéede to receiue <hi>Seuerus,</hi> vntill they were certeinly aduertiſed, that <hi>Iulianus</hi> was ſlaine. The vnfortunate Emperour <hi>Iulianus</hi> being dead, his wife <hi>Malia</hi> and his daughter <hi>Eſcutilia</hi> tooke the body, &amp; buried him in a Sepulcher of his great graundfather, on the right hand of the way of <hi>Lauinia. Iulianus</hi> was noted to be a glutton, a gamſter, couetous, and ambitious: and on the other part, he was pitifull, amorous, eloquent, graue, and ſubtile. He liued 56. yeares and 4. monethes: be reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned 11. monethes and 5. dayes. After his death they did neither giue his body honourable funeralls, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned his Sepulcher. This was the end of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus,</hi> who being old, honourable, &amp; rich, would for the exchaunge of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, giue his goods, aduenture his fame, and looſe his life.</q>

                     <hi>Seuerus</hi> was borne in <hi>Etrutio, Clarus</hi> and <hi>Seuerus</hi> being Conſuls, the 4. day of April: and as his mother reported, ſhe had with him
a difficult childbirth, &amp; very tedious to nourſe. In his firſt infancie, he chiefly delighted to play with other children his fellowes, the play of Iudges: and when his lot fell to be Iudge, as ſharpely did he chaſtice their trifling faultes, as he did afterwards chaſtice their errours in earneſt. Hee learned the Gréeke and latine tongues with ſuch ſingular perfection, and was ſo prompt to ſpeake, write, read, &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute in the ſaid tongues, as if hee had béene borne in thoſe countries, and learned no other languages.</q>
At the age of xviij. yeres he was a publique aduocate, and defended cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in lawe: in ſuch wiſe, that if he had followed Science, as hée did Warres, hée had béene no leſſe renowmed in ſcience and letters, then he was famous in armes. He was not full xx. yeares of age, when he firſt entered <hi>Rome:</hi> in which dayes, there reigned the right happie <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius,</hi> and by interceſſion of his kinſeman <hi>Septimius Seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> hée had the office to regiſter daily ſuch as either died
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:3692:138"/>
or were borne in <hi>Rome:</hi> which office, although it were not profitable, yet was it an occaſion of great acquaintance, &amp; to be throughly knowen: becauſe nightly he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to Court to report who was borne, or had died that day.
<q>The firſt night y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he entred <hi>Rome,</hi> by chance his hoſt wher he lodged was reading the life of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour <hi>Adrian,</hi> wherin was relation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great perils which he paſſed, before he might atteine the Empire: <hi>Seuerus</hi> ſaid vnto his hoſt in ieſt. <hi>In trauels &amp; perills I imitate Adrian: I hope alſo that I ſhall ſuccede him in the Empire.</hi> By chance, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour <hi>M. Aurelius</hi> made a general &amp; ſumptuous ſupper vnto many noble <hi>Romans, Seuerus</hi> was amongeſt them, &amp; at the time that he ſhuld haue taken his ſeat at the table, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out regard he placed him in the Emperours chaire: and when others derided him for his negligence &amp; folly which he had comit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Seuerus</hi> aunſwered: <hi>Peace &amp; gibe not, it is poſſible (my deſtinies may be ſuch) that as I nowe ſitt in the imperiall chaire in ieſt, ſo one day I may ſit therin in earneſt. Seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> dreamed on a night, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſuckt the teats of the wolfe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> nourſed <hi>Remus</hi> and <hi>Romulus,</hi> which dreame he alwayes held for a great good ſigne of his future Empire.</q>
In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of his youth, he was both abſolute and diſſolute, eſpecially in womens matters, &amp; other vanities: for which cauſes hee was many times taken, baniſhed, &amp; ſhamed. In the offices of warre, he was placed in them all, eſpecially the office of Queſtor, which he held long time: and it is ſaid of him, that hauing by that office charge of monie, he was dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering, &amp; faithful in diuiding &amp; parting therof. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of Ianuary, in the 5. yeare of the Empire of <hi>M. Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> it chaunced him to be Proconſul of <hi>Betica,</hi> which now in <hi>Spaine</hi> is named the kingdome of <hi>Andoloizia,</hi> where he remained y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpace of a yeare &amp; a halfe: in which gouernment he was no leſſe loued then feared, and feared then loued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seuerus</hi> being Proconſul in <hi>Betica,</hi> receiued newes of his fathers death in <hi>Africa:</hi> wherupon he preſently paſſed into <hi>Africa,</hi> partly to execute the obſequies, and to giue his father an honourable Sepulcher, and partly to take
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:3692:139"/>
order for a ſiſter that was left vnto him, and goods whiche he did inherite. The Conſul that then was reſident in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> ſent <hi>Seuerus</hi> for his Embaſſadour to the <hi>Sardinians,</hi> which were reuolted from the <hi>Romanes:</hi> and entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Sardinia</hi> with certeine burning torches, according to the maner of an Embaſſadour of <hi>Rome,</hi> there came vnto him a towneſman after the faſhion of a ieſter, and did imbrace him, whom <hi>Seuerus</hi> commaunded to be whipt, ſaying: <hi>In the act of ſo great grauitie, trifling gibes be inconuenient.</hi> For that which this ieſter did, and for the diſgrace which <hi>Seuerus</hi> receiued, they ordeyned in <hi>Rome,</hi> that from thence forth, Embaſſadours alwayes ſhould enter all cities on horſebacke, as in times paſt they had vſed on foote.

                  <q>At the age

Although <hi>Seuerus</hi> of perſon was valiant, and Capitaine of <hi>Rome,</hi> and alſo of indifferent eloquence, yet they gaue him no good interteinment in all <hi>Grecia:</hi> for which cauſe when he came afterwardes vnto the Empire, he ſtreightly reuenged the olde vnkindneſſe which he bare vnto the <hi>Greekes,</hi> euery day diminiſhing their priuiledges. Being returned from <hi>Aſia</hi> vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> hee was ſente Embaſſadour vnto the prouince of <hi>Lugdune,</hi> which nowe in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> is named <hi>Lion</hi> of <hi>Sonorona:</hi> and being at that time a widower, they practiſed with him a marriage with a certeine Lady of noble bloud, in countenance moſt faire, and gratious in geſture. That Lady was named <hi>Iulia,</hi> &amp; of royall bloud: vnto whome purpoſing to preſent iewels of great price, and finding no goldſmith ſufficient to performe the ſame: being alſo aduertiſed of a goldſmith in <hi>Syria</hi> that excelled all men in that facultie, and doubting all meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to be inſufficient, trauelled in his owne perſon, to fetch the ſame: &amp; as he after made reporte vnto his ſpouſe, that with the rewards which he gaue vnto the goldſmith, and the charge of that voyage, hée might twiſe haue béene

The Senators ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to reproue <hi>Seuerus,</hi> not becauſe he had married, but for the great iourney and large expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which he had paſſed for a woman: aduiſing him, that it was not conuenient for a citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> to imploy his perſon, but to aduaunce his honour: either conſume his goods, but for defence of the common wealth: whereunto <hi>Senerus</hi> aunſweared, that for none of thoſe matters wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was blamed, he either deſerued blame or puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: becauſe without all compariſon, much more was the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of that Lady with whom he was married, then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences or trauells which for her ſeruice he had ſuffered. And further he ſaid: it ſeemeth vnto mée (fathers conſcript) that for this acte I deſerue honour, &amp; no blame, ſince there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ariſeth vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> both honour and profite: becauſe ſtrange kingdoms haue ſéene, that Captaines of <hi>Rome,</hi> to obteine riches, haue ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth &amp; ſkil, and to ſpend them haue noble minds. <hi>Seuerus</hi> ſtayed ioyntly 3. yeares in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> both loued and feared, &amp; no leſſe reuerenced of the <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:</hi> not onely for that he was iuſt in iudgment, and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in expences, but aboue the reſt, in that he was of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere life. The Calends of Ianuarie being come, (at what time in <hi>Rome</hi> they diuide their offices) the Proconſulſhip of <hi>Sicylia</hi> was allotted vnto <hi>Seuerus,</hi> wherof he receiued no ſmal griefe, partly for that he found himſelf very wel pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> &amp; feared the condition of the <hi>Sicylians.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſident in the Iſle of <hi>Sicyl,</hi> he was accuſed by his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he did not exerciſe the gouernement of the common wealth, ſo much as the ſearch of ſouthſayers, who ſhould be Emperour of <hi>Rome:</hi> becauſe in thoſe dayes <hi>Commodus</hi> was Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all men held it for certaine, that for his wickedneſſe he ſhould be ſlaine, or himſelfe, for his great vitiouſnes, ſhould die. <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> receiued great diſpleaſure when hee vnderſtoode, that being (as hee was) aliue, and but a young man, <hi>Seuerus</hi> ſhould ſéeke for the ſucceſſion of his Empire: for which cauſe <hi>Seuerus</hi> was forced preſently to depart from <hi>Sicyl,</hi> &amp; come to <hi>Rome,</hi> there to diſcouer and make proofe of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie:

becauſe the daunger was no greater, then loſſe of honour and life.

Two monethes after theſe matters paſſed, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lends of Ianuarie were come, in which <hi>Seuerus</hi> was elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Conſul, ioyntly with <hi>Apuleius Rufinus:</hi> the day that this was publiſhed, they ſay that <hi>Seuerus</hi> ſaid. <hi>This day it is manifeſted in mee, that men neither know what proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perities be conuenient for them, either what aduerſities doe impeache them: and I ſay it for this cauſe, for that criminally I was accuſed in Rome, and my perſon priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the place of malefactours: whereof there proceded, that I departed from Sicyl, came to Rome, giue ſafetie vnto my life, augment my goods, recouer fame, take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of mine enimies, and obtaine the Conſulſhip of the common wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The time paſſed of his Conſulſhip, hee ſtoode an whole yeare without any office: and as he afterwards ſaid many times, the beſt and merrieſt dayes of all his life, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in that yeare, wherein he had no office in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. In thoſe dayes, <hi>Letus</hi> the Captaine of the guard was greatly in fauour with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour <hi>Commodus:</hi> by whoſe interceſſion they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended the garriſons of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> vnto <hi>Seuerus,</hi> who ſo ſkilfully behaued himſelfe in that iourney, that he returned 2. yeares after vnto <hi>Rome</hi> with great honour, &amp; no ſmal riches.

               <p>IN the 10. yeare of the Empire of <hi>Commodus, Seuerus</hi> was ſent in meſſage vnto the prouince of <hi>Germanie:</hi> in which Ambaſſage, he obteyned much honour, and no ſmall wealth: for naturally he was of great diſpatch in affaires, and ſkilfull to gather monie. Hée was reſident in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> the ſpace of thrée yeares, that is to ſay, vntill in <hi>Rome</hi> they had ſlaine the Emperour <hi>Commodus:</hi> of whole death he had great pleaſure, and of the election of <hi>Pertinax</hi> no leſſe ioy: becauſe the liuing was his moſt ſpecial friend, and the dead his mortall enimie. Not many monethes after he receiued newes how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour <hi>Pertinax</hi> was ſlaine by the <hi>Pretorians,</hi> and that hée (for very monie) had bought the Empire, he was much gréeued with the death of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one and the election of the other. <hi>Seuerus</hi> was aduertiſed how <hi>Iulianus</hi> was in great hatred of the people, for merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing of the Empire: preſently at the inſtant the men of warre that he had with him, declared him Emperour: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was done in a citie named <hi>Carunto,</hi> on the xii. day of the moneth of Auguſt. That day whereon the armies did aduaunce him as Emperour, he gaue and diuided amongſt them ſo great ſummes of monie, as neuer any Emperour had done afore time: for he gaue, not onely all his owne, but alſo the treaſure of his friends.

They being perſons of ſo great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, riches, and auncient, that came foorth to receiue him, were not a litle deſpited, that <hi>Seuerus</hi> ſhould commaund them to be diſarmed, but in the end they accompliſhed that which was commaunded them, and from thence foorth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued againſt <hi>Seuerus</hi> mortall hatred: becauſe if they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed their perſons of armour, they did arme their hartes with malice. And as <hi>Seuerus</hi> was proud with his Empire, and the Conſuls and Senatours wiſe and aduiſed, neither did he perceiue them to be offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, either did they diſcouer themſelues to be gréeued or deſpited: for that, if they had patience to ſuffer the iniurie, they wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted not wiſedome to diſſemble the ſame. As <hi>Seuerus</hi> was ſubtile and ſkilful, he did two thinges before he entered <hi>Rome,</hi> wherewith hée greatly wanthe fauour of the common people: wherof the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:3692:142"/>
firſt was, that he publikely changed his ouer name, which is to wit, that as he afore time was named <hi>Septimius Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerus,</hi> after he was named <hi>Seuerus Pertinax:</hi> &amp; this he did, to the end al men ſhould perceiue, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> taking the name of the good Emperour <hi>Pertinax,</hi> he would likewiſe folow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſteps of his good life, and profite himſelfe by his good doctrine: for <hi>Pertinax</hi> was not only loued as a man, but alſo adored as a God. And the ſecond thing which he did, was, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund al the bands of Pretorians, which were the men at armes which guarded <hi>Rome,</hi> that leauing all armour, they ſhuld come &amp; do him reuerence: which were the men y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had ſlaine th'emperour <hi>Pertinax,</hi> not for his owne deſeruing, but for that he conſented not to their wickednes. <hi>Seuerus</hi> ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had agréed with his armie, that they ſhould haue regard to compaſſe them round, in ſuch wiſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> finding them vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, they ſhould ſtop al meanes to recouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame for their defence: either place of ſafetie to flie vnto. And now, when they ſtood all vnarmed, &amp; compaſſed, <hi>Seuerus</hi> commaunded a general ſilence thoroughout his armieꝭ and directed his words vnto thoſe homicides or manſiears, ſpeaking after this maner.</p>

The great Romaine Empire much reſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bleth the immortal gods of heauen: becauſe all the kingdomes of the earth be finiſhing &amp;

And as it is moſt true, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the gods neuer giue reward with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a preceding merit: ſo do they not giue puniſhment without ſome fault in him, whom they chaſtiſe: wher of it followeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſince the gods haue giuen vnto the Romanes ſo many and ſo great triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phes, there ought to be in them many &amp; very notable deſeruings. There be two things which cauſe the Romans to hold fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods, &amp; to be lords of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is to wit, great worſhippers of temples, and conſeruers of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in iuſtice: for that countrie where temples be not honoured, and the wicked chaſtiſed, may be better ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a den of theeues, then a kingdome of good men. Ye all vnderſtand that be here preſent, howe ye haue ſlaine the Emperour Pertinax, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt ſurely both holy and moſt holy, becauſe the greatnes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, being conferred with the ſinceritie of his deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, it had not beene much for him, but rather a ſmal reward, to haue beene Lord of the whole world. In this deede ye haue offended the gods, eſcandalized men, committed treaſon vnto your Lord, defamed your countrie, troubled your common wealth, and brought all Rome vnto confuſion, in ſuch wiſe, that your fault being ſo exceeding, it may not deſerue any parcialitie in puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Now that ye haue ſlaine him, is it as if ye had ſlaine Caligula, Nero, Sergius, Vitellius, Domitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modꝰ? no, but Pertinax, which was one of the princes moſt without reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſion, that euer reigned in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Empire. As princes be few &amp; wilful, ſo it is a

venture, to chance on ſuch as be good: &amp; ſo much the more deſerue ye the greater paine, as the good Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax was profitable vnto the common wealth. Vnto whome ſhall Rome aduenture to commit her truſt, ſince they which were appointed for her guard, haue ſet her a ſale? O treaſon neuer thought of! Oh wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes neuer heard of! to kill the Emperour, and to ſell the Empire. After the vaſſals haue ſlaine their Lord, and the natiues of the countrie haue ſold their common wealth, I know not why the gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund not the ground to ſwallow you vp, and preſently put not fire into Rome to conſume it: for, after ſo great an infamie, Rome ought neuer more to be named in this world. Who ſhould haue ſaid to Quintus Cincina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Numa Pompilius, Camillus, Marcus Fabritius, Mutius Scaeuola, Silla, Marius, Scipio, Iulius Caeſar, Auguſtus, Germanicus (who with great and many triumphes did both beautifie and magnifie Rome) that ye ſhould haue ſet Rome in open ſale? I firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeue, and am out of doubte, that they would haue died of pure ſorrowe: or elſe would haue ſlaine your progenitours from whom ye are deſcended. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the time I departed out of Germanie, I came muſing vppon the way, what puniſhment I ſhould giue you: for of the one part, if I ſuffer euery one of you with his life, it redoundeth to the ſcandal of the common wealth: and if I would take the ſame from you, the paine is very ſmal, in reſpecte of your extreme fault: for vnto one that is euil, they doe him no ſmall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite, to rid him out of this world. I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund your noſes to be ſlit, your tongues to be boared, your gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments beneth the waſt to be cut off, and your beards halfe ſhauen: yee ſhall liue without honour, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite,

or libertie as ſlaues &amp; bondmen in the common wealth: in ſuch wiſe, that ye ſhall not die as the good do vſe to die, to the end to liue: but ye ſhal liue as the wicked do liue, to the end to die. Neither doe I ſuffer you to liue, becauſe ye deſerue life: but for that I will not ſtaine my fame with your filthie bloud. If in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing you al death, I might giue the good Pertinax his life: not onely yours, but alſo right willingly would I offer mine owne: becauſe there is no vent more iuſt, then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one good life (by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exchange of many wicked liues) might be bought &amp; redemed.

There is nothing more iuſt, then to kil him that killeth: but I commaund not that ye be ſlaine, although ye durſt kill the good Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinax: and this I do not, to the end to do no iuſtice, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to doe you good or pleaſure: but for that many yeares ye ſhall haue time to bewaile your wretched life, and his innocent death.</p>

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:3692:144"/>
                  <hi>Pertinax,</hi> he determined to enter <hi>Rome,</hi> and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing was mixt with ioy and ſorow: becauſe of the one part ſeing him ſo great a frend of iuſtice, they reioyced: and on the other part to ſée him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſed with ſo great armies, they feared him. Preſently vpon his entrie into <hi>Rome,</hi> he viſited y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> temples (according to the cuſtome of the <hi>Romane</hi> Emperours) and <q>there he offered no ſmall, but generous &amp;
ſumptuous ſacrifices. Although in his receyuing, a great part of the day was ſpent, and in viſiting temples the reſt was conſumed, and now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was night, he was reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of all men to take his eaſe, and to withdrawe vnto his palace: yet he would in no wiſe conſent, vntil he had viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Sepulcher of the good <hi>Marcus Aurelius:</hi> where he remained a great ſpace vppon his knées, and poured foorth many lamentable teares.</q>
The next day he went vnto the high Capitol, where all the Senate was aſſembled, and there he ſpake vnto all the Senatours, Conſuls, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Romane</hi> officers: to whome he ſaid many good words, and gaue them great hope of many rewards. All the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Rome</hi> were aſtonied, &amp; terrified, to behold the great audacitie and fortune of <hi>Seuerus:</hi> which procéeded of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration howe without daunger, and leſſe trauell, hée ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned the Empire: for that he gat it not by ſheding others bloud, neither by the exchange of his owne proper goodes. The firſt day that <hi>Seuerus</hi> ſpake in the Senate, he made a ſolemne vow before them all: <hi>Neuer to kill any Romane, if he were not iudged by iuſtice: or to take the goods of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſon, if by the fiſcal he were not condemned.</hi> If it had béene found in <hi>Seuerus</hi> workes, which hée ſware that day in wordes, namely, that they might not accuſe him of crueltie, either note him of couetouſnes, it had béene a great weale for the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire: <q>for <hi>there is nothing wherwith princes doe more deſtroy their common weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, and alſo ſtaine their perſons, then to bee giuen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge their owne proper iniuries, and couetous of other</hi>
                     <hi>mens goodes.</hi> Forthwith at his beginning, <hi>Seuerus</hi> did ſhew himſelfe milde, benigne, pitifull, liberall, valiant har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:3692:144"/>
affable, gratious, and humaine, imbracing his famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, ioying and laughing with ſtraungers: in ſuch wiſe, that the <hi>Romanes</hi> went after him, hearing what he ſaid, and praiſing what he did. If in humaine affaires he were prouident, in diuine matters ſurely he was not negligent: for that euery day hée viſited temples, honoured prieſtes, offered ſacrifices, repaired edifices, heard orphans and afflicted: in ſuch wiſe, that in victories they compared him vnto <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> in humaine policies to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and in diuine thinges to <hi>Pompilius.</hi> The old Senatours and auncient <hi>Romanes,</hi> that had béen bred with <hi>Seuerus</hi> from their youth, were amaſed to ſée how his euil condition was changed: and on the other part they thought with themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, that all which he did was but fained: for of his owne naturall condition, he was ſubtile, warie, milde, and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and did know how to denie his owne will for a time, in that which hée wiſhed, to doe afterwardes with all men all that he deſired.</q>
                  <hi>It is a point of wiſe and ſkilfull men, to ouercome their owne wills in ſmall matters: afterwardes to drawe others after them for cauſes of greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce.</hi>

The firſt office that hée gaue in <hi>Rome,</hi> was vnto <hi>Flauius Iuue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> whome hee made Pretor of the people: of whiche prouiſion of the one part he pleaſed all men, becauſe <hi>Flaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:3692:145"/>
was a vertuous perſon: and on the other parte it did grieue them, becauſe he was ſeruaunt vnto <hi>Iulianus.</hi> The whole armie that <hi>Seuerus</hi> led with him, he alſo brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the citie of <hi>Rome:</hi> and being in quantitie great, and of condition proud, they might not be contained within the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for which cauſe they lodged not onely in houſes priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged, and in ſacred temples, but forceably brake vp doores and entred houſes. The <hi>Romanes</hi> receiued the ſame for a very great iniurie, becauſe they onely felt not the deſpight done vnto their perſons, but alſo did bewaile the breach &amp; loſſe of their liberties. Thrée dayes after <hi>Seuerus</hi> entered <hi>Rome,</hi> the captaines of his armies ſent to demaund of the Senate, to haue giuen them an hundred thouſand peſants of gold, which were due vnto them: for that in times paſt, ſo much was giuen vnto them that firſt entered with the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> At the houre when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> captaines ſent theſe words vnto the Senat, preſently and ioyntly they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themſelues, and marched vnto the field, ſwearing and forſwearing, by the life of <hi>Seuerus,</hi> &amp; by the world of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> that if it were not giuen that day, at night they would ſack <hi>Rome.</hi> After that <hi>Seuerus</hi> heard, that his armie was in readineſſe in the field of <hi>Mars,</hi> and without his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, he was not a litle eſcandalized, thinking there had béene ſome treaſon againſt him amongeſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people: but the truth being knowen, he requeſted them to be pacified, and to diſarme themſelues, ſaying: that <hi>it proceeded not of wiſe Captaines, but of ſeditious perſons, to demaund with threatenings, that which would be giuen by requeſt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerus</hi> ſaw himſelfe in great trauell, to finiſh agréement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the one &amp; the other: but in the end giuing them ſome monie out of his owne coffers, and ſome from the common wealth, he brought them all to a vnitie: which was, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnto the Captaines was giuen leſſe then they demaunded, and the <hi>Romanes</hi> paid ſomewhat more then they offered. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things, <hi>Seuerus</hi> did celebrate the obſequies of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinax:</hi> whereat all the <hi>Romanes</hi> were preſent, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that day vnto the Gods great ſacrifices, accompting

               <p>The kinge of the <hi>Armenians</hi> aunſweared the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours of <hi>Peſſenius Niger,</hi> that he woulde neither helpe the one, or offende the other, but defende and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue his owne kingdome: moued therevnto, for that <hi>Peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius</hi> was his friende, and <hi>Seuerus</hi> not his enimie.</p>
               <p>The kinge of <hi>Parthians,</hi> preſently ſente his letters

throughout his kingdome, commaunding them to repaire vnto <hi>Peſſenius,</hi> and refuſe <hi>Seuerus:</hi> which he did not for the narrowe friendſhip that he helde with <hi>Peſſenius,</hi> but for the auncient enimitie that he did beare vnto the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire. The king of <hi>Arthabanes</hi> ſent vnto <hi>Peſſenius,</hi> ten thouſand archers with croſſebowes, all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues of the prouinces of <hi>Berſezana,</hi> which throughout the worlde were much renowmed, and in the warres no leſſe feared, becauſe they were of valiant mindes in fight, and excéeding readie in ſhooting. Further, <hi>Peſſenius Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> commaunded his armie to be renewed with twentie thouſand footemen, and ſixe thouſand horſemen, whereof the moſte parte being taken out of <hi>Antioche</hi> (where the people be moſt féeble) their names being regiſtred, and receiuing paye, neuer afterwardes came to the warres. Vnto all them that vſed this guyle, <hi>Seuerus</hi> afterwardes gaue great puniſhment: not for that they had béene tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours vnto <hi>Peſſenius,</hi> but for example to terrifie others. Vpon the mount <hi>Taurus</hi> parte of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> and <hi>Sicyl, Peſſenius,</hi> as a man of experience in martiall affaires, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided that the woodes were feld vpon the toppes of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teines, and in ſtreightes, and moſt perillous places made ſtrong watche and warde, in ſuch wiſe, that no enimie might approche, that was not ſéene: or paſſe, that were not ſlaine.

               <p>IT was great griefe vnto <hi>Seuerus,</hi> when he vnderſtoode howe <hi>Peſſenius</hi> was in ſo greate redineſſe, that thought not onely to defende, but publiquely to offende. <hi>Seuerus</hi> being certified that <hi>Peſſenius</hi> was in poſſeſſion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greate citie <hi>Byzantio,</hi> marched with more ſpéede, with intent to batter the ſame, before <hi>Peſſenius</hi> might come to the ſuccour thereof: for that by ſecrete practiſes, <hi>Seuerus</hi> had within the citie newe friendes: and <hi>Peſſenius</hi> in gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had recouered ſome enimies. Neither the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences which <hi>Seuerus</hi> practiſed ſecretely, either the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences whiche he vſed publiquely, might profite him to obteine <hi>Byzantio:</hi> which when he vnderſtoode, he trauei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to recouer another citie not farre from thence, named <hi>Cyzica:</hi> which was both rockie and compaſſed with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, that is to ſaye, it ſtoode vppon a rocke, &amp; inuironed with a riuer. <hi>Peſſenius</hi> had for his capteine generall of all his hoſtes, a certeine knight named <hi>Emilianus,</hi> in whome he repoſed confidence, not onely for matters of warre, but alſo for expedition of cauſes of peace, for that he had bothe wiſedome for the one, and fortitude for the other. The cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine <hi>Emilianus</hi> put him ſelfe into the citie of <hi>Cyzica,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preſently after, the ſouldiours of <hi>Seuerus</hi> came to beſiege it. There was betwixt both the armies at diuers times,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:3692:148"/>
diuers encounters, &amp; repulſes, wherin Fortune indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcouered her ſelfe vnto either partie: for at all times, when they fought at the wall, <hi>Seuerus</hi> ſide had the woorſe: but when they fought in the field, <hi>Peſſenius</hi> bandes had y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> repulſe. Two monethes after the citie of <hi>Cizica</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, they made a ſalle, and as they would haue retyred, <hi>Seuerus</hi> capteines purſued and entred pelle melle with the capteines of <hi>Peſſenius:</hi> and notwithſtanding there was betwixt them greate ſlaughter for the recouering of a gate, and to fortifie a certeine place: in the ende <hi>Peſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> loſt the citie, and <hi>Seuerus</hi> obteined the victorie. <hi>Peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius</hi> greatly complained, and ſo was it bruted amongſt the people, which is to wéete, that the capteine <hi>Emilianus</hi> had ſecrete practiſe with <hi>Seuerus:</hi> for, conſidering the ſtately walles wherewith the citie <hi>Cizica</hi> was compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the valiant people wherewith it was defended: al men iudged it impoſſible to take it, and follie to beſiege it. The cauſe that moued the capteine <hi>Emilianus</hi> to do this vnworthie déede, was: that his ſonnes, who were left at <hi>Rome, Seuerus</hi> brought with him into that warre, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great garde: and it is to be thought, that to giue liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vnto his ſonnes which he had ingendred, he made a breache of his fidelitie and othe which he had ſworne. The Emperour <hi>Commodus,</hi> as he was ſuſpicious of them, with whome he had to deale: and ſo euil wiſhed of all ſuch as did ſerue him: ſo it was his faſhion, for the moſt parte, when he ſent any noble <hi>Roman</hi> to gouerne any prouince, preſently to place their ſonnes in a fort: and this he did, to the end their fathers ſhould not be traitours, reſpectinge their children that were kept vnder ward. From the time that <hi>Commodus</hi> reigned in <hi>Rome, Emilianus</hi> gouerned the prouinces in <hi>Aſia:</hi> by which cauſe <hi>Seuerus</hi> recouered the children, &amp; <hi>Peſſenius</hi> loſt the father. The fame being diuulgate throughout all <hi>Aſia,</hi> that the citie <hi>Cizica</hi> was ſacked, &amp; that <hi>Seuerus</hi> kept the field with victorie: all <hi>Peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius</hi> knightes that ſcaped from thence, &amp; all other their companions that heard therof, gaue them ſelues to flight:

to ſéeke places of fortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherein to hide their perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. <hi>Seuerus</hi> not onely recouered honour &amp; profite of this victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but alſo planted both feare &amp; diſcorde almoſte through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Grecia:</hi> for ſome rebelled againſt <hi>Peſſenius,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did obey <hi>Seuerus.</hi> Although the people of <hi>Grecia</hi> haue ableneſſe to learne ſcience, they are no leſſe mutable in martial affaires: for in warres which they proſequute, they follow not the Prince that hath moſt iuſtice, but him that moſt is fauoured of Fortune. The citizens of <hi>Bithy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> ſent Ambaſſadours vnto <hi>Seuerus,</hi> ſaying, that they &amp; their children were at his commaundement: and on the other ſide, the people of <hi>Nicena</hi> gaue <hi>Peſſenius</hi> to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that if he ſent his armie thither, they woulde not only receiue them, but alſo mainteine them: which offers they preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted not vnto theſe two <hi>Roman</hi> princes, for loue or friendſhip that they did beare them: but for the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent enimitie which they had betwixt them ſelues. <hi>Seuerus</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his armie entring <hi>Bithynia,</hi> and <hi>Peſſenius</hi> into <hi>Nicena,</hi> from thence, as from two fortes, they did iſſue to fight: &amp; in the end betwixt the two armies vpon a certeine day, they trauerſed ſo fierce a ſkirmiſhe, that in bloud &amp; ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was no leſſe then a battel: where the field remained vnto <hi>Seuerus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Peſſenius</hi> bands were put to flight. <hi>Peſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi>ꝰ neither for the loſſe of the citie <hi>Cizica,</hi> neither for that he was beaten out of the field at <hi>Bithynia,</hi> did ſhewe either feare or weakeneſſe: but diuiding his armie that remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in two partes, he ſent the one to mount <hi>Taurus</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend that paſſage from <hi>Seuerus,</hi> &amp; the other parte he ledde with him ſelfe vnto <hi>Antioche,</hi> partely to take money out of his treaſurie, &amp; partly to renue, as alſo relieue his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. <hi>Seuerus</hi> marched w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his armie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Theſe fiftéene thouſand archers named <hi>Mauri</hi> departed vnto <hi>Laodycia</hi> and <hi>Tyrus,</hi> and manie other that ioyned with them: &amp; as they tooke them at the ſoudeine being vnprouided, and hauing no time to demaund ſuccour of <hi>Seuerus:</hi> ſo cruell and inhumane was that barbarous people, to thoſe ſo generous and noble ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that they left not vpon the walles one ſtone vpon an other, either houſe that they ſubuerted not, either the hed of man woman or childe that they did not cutt off. When theſe matters paſſed in <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> the knightes of <hi>Seuerus</hi> were in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> traueiling greatly to poſſeſſe the mount <hi>Taurus:</hi> but as it was naturally of great height, and rockie, &amp; <hi>Peſſenius</hi> poſſeſſing all the paſſages, ſo they might not by any meane aſſaile them, or conceiue hope of any profitable or honourable attempt. Vpon the top of this mount <hi>Taurus, Peſſenius</hi> his people had brought an huge number of great ſtones and rockes, to throwe down vpon <hi>Seuerus</hi> ſouldiours, if they ſhould attempt to climbe the hill: but as on the ſide of the mounteine, there grewe many trées, both high and great, which <hi>Seuerus</hi> ſouldiers cut downe in great heapes &amp; multitudes to ſtay the ſtones before they tumbled vpon men, that might be throwne

In hauing redy captaines to fight, and ſkilfull to defende none of the armies had cauſe to complaine, either of their enimies to haue enuie, except that <hi>Peſſenius</hi> was more vertuous, and <hi>Seuerus</hi> more venturous,</p>

If the two armies were valiant in fighting, ſurely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two princes, their lordes, were no cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes: but in the ende, when night was come, the <hi>Peſſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> turned their backes: &amp; the whole concluſion was, that <hi>Peſſenius</hi> fledde wounded, and <hi>Seuerus</hi> remained lorde of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> field.

This was the ſorrowfull end of <hi>Peſſenius Niger,</hi> vpon whoſe ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they placed this Epitaph: <hi>Here lieth Peſſenius Niger, an auncient Romane, whiche in merite was equall with the vertuous: but in miſfortunes exceeded the moſt vnfortunate.</hi>

Aboue, it is ſaid, how <hi>Seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> came to <hi>Rome</hi> to take the Empire, and howe <hi>Peſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> was ouercome in <hi>Aſia</hi>: there reſteth nowe to ſpeake of <hi>Albinius,</hi> who was in <hi>Britaine</hi>: a man in his life righte venturous, and in his deathe no leſſe vnfortunate. <hi>Albinius</hi> was natiue of <hi>Rome,</hi> and as ſoone as he was of age ſufficient, he was made a Senatour, being of moſt auncient linage, and did inherite of his predeceſſours, greate wealth, whiche he wanted no ſkill to conſerue, as alſo to increaſe, and excellently to inioy: for, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his degree was but a Senatour: yet in ſeruice of his houſe, and behauiour of his perſon, he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> manner of an Emperour. In the dayes of the empire of <hi>Pertinax, Albinius</hi> was ſente as captaine and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour vnto greate <hi>Britaine</hi>: in whiche gouernement hee was very well loued, and no leſſe feared: for by his greate iuſtice he was feared and with his greate libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie he was beloued. When <hi>Seuerus</hi> departed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Aſia,</hi> to warre with <hi>Peſſenius,</hi> vnderſtandinge how renouned the name of <hi>Albinius</hi> was throughout all the worlde, and howe well liked of the <hi>Romaine</hi> Empire: hee greatly doubted to aduaunce him ſelfe with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Empire: and the rather, for that he perceiued the principall <hi>Romanes,</hi> to fixe their eyes vpon <hi>Albinius. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerus</hi> aduiſed him ſelfe to vſe a certaine cautele with <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binius,</hi> which was: before he departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

haue his felowſhip in the Empire, from thence forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituling him <hi>Auguſtus</hi>: &amp; ſince his departing to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warrs of <hi>Aſia,</hi> requeſting him to take the charge of the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the common wealth. With theſe and ſuche like wordes whiche hee ſente him, and with a letter written vnto him, and certaine iuells whiche hee gaue him, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binius</hi> did endure to be deceiued, though voide of all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt to be deceiued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Albinius</hi> had with him an auncient knight named <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pro Albo,</hi> who (as it is reported) ſaide vnto <hi>Albinius: thou art not ſo neare a kinſeman, either ſo deare a friende vnto Seuerus, that without thy requeſt, hee will with thee diuide the Empire: for that truely, euen betwixt the father and the ſonne, it were verie muche: but that I thinke hee will nowe be aſſured of thee, to the ende when hee returneth from the warres to deſtroy thee: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe from a man ſo noble as Seuerus is, ſo amorous let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and iuells ſo precious, may not proceede, but wrapt in malice. Albinius</hi> woulde giue no credit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Cypro Albo,</hi> but openly did reade his letters, and ſhewed his iuells: whiche when <hi>Seuerus</hi> vnderſtoode, hee receiued greate pleaſure thereof: and the better to finiſhe his guile, hee made money in both their names, placing <hi>Albinius</hi> his picture in the Senate. The minde of <hi>Albinius</hi> being wonne and obtained, to the ende to holde ſafe and ſure the kingdomes of <hi>Europa,</hi> hee departed into <hi>Aſia</hi>: and ſundry times did write vnto <hi>Albini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and not vnto the Senate: giuing accompt of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whiche hee had donne, and demaundinge counſell in that whiche hee mente to do.</p>
               <p>Fifteene monethes <hi>Seuerus</hi> ſtayed in the warres with <hi>Peſſenius</hi>: whome, after hee had ouercome and ſlaine, he determined to deſtroy <hi>Albinius</hi>: and becauſe hee had no occaſion, either greate or ſmall to make him publike warre, hee aduiſed to kill him by guile.

Albinius and I, beeing young men, were bred in the houſe of the good Emperour Marcus Aurelius: and truly, vnto this day, I haue intreated him, not as a companion, but as a brother: which ſeemeth no leſſe true, for that I parted with him the Empire, which ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is diuided betwixt the father and the ſonne. I did not onely deale with him as with a brother, and with him did parte the Empire: but alſo at my iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney vnto the warres of Aſia, vnto him onely I reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the gouernement of the common wealth: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the poſſeſſion which I had of him, and the confidence which I committed vnto him, when I did truſt him with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth: I would haue parted my ſoule with him, if it had benepartible. Being (as I was) wounded in the warres of Aſia, and he placed in the gouernement of great Britaine: notwithſtanding the diſtance that was betwixt them, there paſſed fewe monethes wherein I did not write vnto him, giuing large acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of that which was done, and hideing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge of all that I determined to do: In ſuche wiſe, that in him was regiſtred al my triumphs, and he was the hoorde of al my profound ſecreats. Betwixt me &amp; Albinius, there was neuer any thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, in my houſe there was neuer doore ſhut againſt him, the letters which he wrote I did with greate ioy reade, that which he requeſted me I alwayes perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, whereof he warned me I euer corrected: final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he neuer deſired any thing of me, that he obtayned not: and neuer had trauell, but I was preſent, and preſt to ſuccour him. After all theſe things, his ſorrowfull deſtinies woulde, and no leſſe hath my fortune with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out al felicitie perfourmed, that our friendſhip is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to enimitie, our felicitie vnto treaſon, our benefits
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:3692:154"/>
to ingratitude, our loue vnto hatred, our communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to diuorce, our confidence to ſuſpicion, in ſuch wiſe, that at this day there is nothing ſpoken more commonly throughout the Romane Empire, but of the greate friendſhip whiche wee haue had, and the cruell enimitie whiche nowe we haue. That Albini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us deſireth to be Lorde, and procureth to be Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, I neither wonder, either is it to be marueled: but that which maketh me amaſed, is, that I placeing him with confidence in gouernement of the common wealth, he ſhuld procure to riſe or rebell with Rome: that ſpeaking according to the lawe of a good man, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if Albinius had thought to attempte ſo foule a dede, if I had requeſted him to take the charge, he ought not to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſented: for there is not the like traitour in this world, as he to whom I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted my houſe, to robbe me of mine honour, and ſpoile mee of my goods. A greater faulte in leſſe magiſtrates hath Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius committed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Peſſenius Niger: for that Peſſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us from the time that I was elected Emperour, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently manifeſted him ſelfe mine enimie: &amp; more, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I neuer helde him as my friende, either did he accepte me as his Lord: and to ſay that which I had thought neuer to haue ſaide, Peſſenius Niger did write vnto vs, that if wee would perpetuate the principalitie of Aſia vnto him, he woulde vtterly yealde vnto vs all obedience: and for that we would not graunt it him, ſpeaking without paſſion, although he had no reaſon to rebell, he had occaſion to be offended. The matter hath not ſo paſſed betwixt Albinius and me, but that without his owne ſute, or any other mannes for him, beſides the gouernement of Britaine, I gaue him the principalitie of al Europe, ſent him the enſigne of the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:3692:154"/>
Empire, commaunded him by proclamation to be intituled Auguſtus. &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is not ſmally to be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temed, I cauſed with his image &amp; mine, money to be grauen, and with mine owne proper handes I placed his ſtatuie or picture in the Senate. In repaimente of theſe ſo notable benefites, he hath committed an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth thouſand inſolences, namely, hee hath muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the armies, altered and offended the people, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed our treaſures, taken our caſtels, eſcandalized me with the Romanes, and nowe of late hath ſlaine my Purſeuaunts: and that whiche grieueth me moſte, is, that he made them ſay in their tormentes, that which neuer was in my thought. I hauing ſlaine the prince Peſſenius, and beeing (as I was) triumphant of the fielde, no man hath to beleeue that I haue ſo ſmall eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of my honour, that he beeing my detected enimie, ſhoulde be ſlaine in ſecrete at my commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demente.</p>
               <p>In what heart may it be conceiued, that I hauinge (as I haue) armies of ſo greate power and dexteritie, here in my preſence, ſhoulde procure to kill him with poyſon. For to haue ſlaine Albinius by treaſon, it had beene blame to me, and ſhame vnto you, but to him glory: for as his name is renowned, and his fame ſpread throughout the Empire, his perſon to haue beene ſo inuincible, that wee durſt not giue him battell as an enimie, but murther him as tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours.</p>
               <p>The Godds neuer conſent, neither my venturous deſtinies permit, that the ſlaunderous renowne of a traytour, whiche hee hath recouered with his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill life, ſhoulde cleaue vnto mee by his ſecreate deathe: for that (to conclude) I had rather
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:3692:155"/>
holde him as an enimie all the dayes of my life, then to fixe any ſcruple in my fame. Albinius did ſweare by the ſimulachre of Diana, not once, but thrice: not with one hande, but with both handes: not in one temple, but in many: for euer more to holde the gods in greate veneration, the people in iuſtice, the temples in reuerence, and to me obedience: all which the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured Albinius hath broken, and neither hath feare or ſhame for that which he hath done: but I hope in the Gods, it ſhal not come to paſſe as he thinketh, that is, to die with poyſon: but the time ſhall come, that hee ſhall pay in the fielde, that which he hath ſworne in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> temple. If this infamous deede had bene done againſt any particular perſon, they ſhould both heare and ſee throughout the world, the amends that I would take thereof: but in as muche as it toucheth none but my ſelfe, who at this preſent am had in ſuſpicion, Albini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us being held as innocente, it ſufficeth that it is not in me, but to aduertiſe you thereof: and to you it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to reuenge the ſame. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warres againſt Peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius Niger, ye folowed me: in this againſt Albinius, I will folow you: and I hope in the immortall Gods, that they wil giue you the victorie: and in my behalfe on Albinius wil take vengeance.</p>

<q>The firſt iourney that <hi>Seuerus</hi> made, was to beſiege <hi>Bizantio</hi> (for thither the captaines repaired that had eſcaped the mortall battaile of <hi>Peſſenius Niger</hi>) and in the ende tooke it, not by force, but by hunger: and hauing the citie vnder his power, he diſplaced the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes, made plaine the towers, ouerthrewe the Theaters, ſubuerted their bathes, burnt their houſes, ſtrangled the ſtraungers, &amp; the natiues he did captiuate: finally, he behaued him ſelfe not as a <hi>Romane</hi> prince, but as a moſte cruel tyrant.</q>

                  <q>His deſire was ſo diſordinate to encounter with <hi>Albinius,</hi> that he traueled night and day, thicke and thinne, foule and faire: and that wherefore they moſt blamed him, was, that he neither obſerued the ſolemne feſtiuall dayes, or had compaſſion of the tyred.

Hee ſent before him valiant captaines, and men very light &amp; of greate ſwiftneſſe, to cleare the wayes vpon the highte of the mountaines, and to defende the moſt perilous places: chiefly when he paſſed the Alpes of <hi>Italie,</hi> doubting that <hi>Albinius</hi> might haue in that place ſome hidden ambuſhe.

After <hi>Seuerus</hi> had eſcaped that daunger, and was cured of his wounde, in greate ſecrecie he called into his preſence certaine Sorcerers and Inchanters that hee brought with him, both requeſting, threatening, and promiſing them manie thinges, if they woulde tell him the ende of thoſe warres: for if hee ſhoulde be conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, hee woulde proſecute the ſame: and if hee ſhoulde be ouercome, he woulde returne into <hi>Italie.</hi> The Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers and Inchaunters anſwered, that his armie ſhould receiue greate hurte, but in the ende his enimie <hi>Albinius</hi> ſhoulde be ouercome: and that hee ſhoulde not obtaine in this caſe, that which he deſired, that is to ſay, to kill <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> with his owne handes: but that hee ſhoulde ſée him deade before his eyes.

In all cities that receiued, obeyed, or ſuccoured <hi>Albinius</hi> or his ſouldiours, <hi>Seuerus</hi> did greate hurte, robbing their goods, and puniſhing their perſons. Manie cities and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple made their excuſe, ſaying, they had not ſerued or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Albinius,</hi> for that they had a deſire ſo to do: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not ſuccoured of <hi>Seuerus,</hi> and yet ceaſed
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:3692:158"/>
not to chaſtice and robbe them. <hi>Albinius</hi> had thrée ſonnes, a daughter, and a wife, generous in bloud and beautifull of face, whoſe throte with his children he commaunded to be cutt, and their bodies alſo to be caſt into the riuer <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus.</hi> And as <hi>Albinius</hi> was of greate power in all the Empire of <hi>Europe,</hi> and of him ſelf verie gratious, liberal, valiant, and noble minded: ſo in a manner all the nobles of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Fraunce,</hi> had followed his parte alike: the throtes of all which, <hi>Seuerus</hi> (after the battaile) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be cutt: and though he ſlewe the fathers, yet he did not therefore pardon the wife and children. <hi>Albinius</hi> his wife and his children being ſlaine, and execution done vpon all perſons that followed his opinion: <hi>Seuerus</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed all their goods and riches, for his owne chamber, which were ſo great, and of ſuch value, that it was doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted whether any Emperour had euer attained vnto the like. The prouinces of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Fraunce</hi> being ordered, and two gouernours placed in greate <hi>Britaine, Seuerus</hi> departed vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> and led with him all his armie: not for that, in all <hi>Italie</hi> he had any enimie bent againſt him, but to terrifie the common wealth of <hi>Rome. Seuerus</hi> of his owne naturall inclination was ſo quarelous, proude, vnquiet, bloudie, and doubtfull, that although he had peace, yet he woulde goe alwayes after the faſhion of a warriour. <hi>Seuerus</hi> was receiued with greate ioye of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> although moſt certeinly many of them ſtoode in greate feare, for that they had wiſhed that <hi>Albinius</hi> might haue preuailed, whereof <hi>Seuerus</hi> had certeine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence: whoſe condition was ſo harde, that to giue a cruell chaſticement, a ſmall occaſion was ſufficient.

It was no ſmall griefe vnto the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that <hi>Seuerus</hi> had giuen ſuch liberties vnto his men of warre: ſaying, that from thenceforth for euer to

weare ringes of golde, they woulde ſpende their owne, &amp; robbe others: and to vſe concubines in their houſes, would cauſe diſſention amongeſt the people, and alſo debilitate their perſons. In <hi>Rome</hi> there was a Conſul named <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> which had his picture placed in the Senate, &amp; was praiſed before all the people with a publique Oration for his worthie actes done in <hi>Aſia</hi>: whereof <hi>Seuerus</hi> tooke greate deſpight, becauſe this <hi>Claudius</hi> was kinſman vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Albinius.

To commaund the <hi>Romanes</hi> to adore &amp; reuerence <hi>Commodus,</hi> as one of the Gods, being (as he was) the woorſt of all men, it was vnto them ſo grieuous to heare, &amp; ſo harde to perfourme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they determined, not to go to the church, either to offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vnto their Gods: becauſe no parte thereof ſhould be allotted vnto the God <hi>Commodus.

That the one delighted, the other lothed: that which the elder affirmed, the younger denied: and if it happened their tutours to commaund them to play to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, if the one did winne, and the other looſe, they tare their haire, ſcratched their faces, whirled ſtones, ſtrucke with their fiſtes, in ſuch wiſe, that as from their téeth and face they drue bloud, and rent off their lockes, ſo they ſéemed rather to kill eche other as enimies, then to ieſt as brethren.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was no ſmall griefe vnto <hi>Seuerus,</hi> when hée vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode of the euil condition of his ſonnes, and that alwayes they were diuided amongeſt themſelues, who trauelled (by al meanes poſſible) to bring them to conformitie, which he might neuer (by any meanes) bring to paſſe, althoughe he requeſted: either would they obey, although hée com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded: for his ſonnes were ſo wilfull, that they ceaſed not to execute their owne wills, notwithſtanding their fathers gentle ſute, or his extréeme commaundement. <hi>Seuerus</hi> alſo had a brother named <hi>Geta,</hi> a perſon of great boloneſſe, and warrlike, who in all warres followed <hi>Seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and if <hi>Seuerus</hi> had hautie thoughtes, truly <hi>Geta</hi> his thoughtes were not humble: for hée helde it for moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that vnto him <hi>Seuerus</hi> ſhould leaue the Empire.

After that <hi>Seuerus</hi> came to be Emperour, he gaue ſo great credite vnto <hi>Plautianus,</hi> and ſo ſtrictly did follow his counſell, that he neither read letter, but hée did ſée it, or ſigned commiſſion that hée liked not, either gaue any reward that he craued not. In the Senate, he was placed in the moſt honourable ſeate: when he came forth into <hi>Rome,</hi> all the Gentlemen did accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie him: when he came out of his houſe, all Embaſſadours did attend on him: in time of warre, all captaines ſued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: if there were playes and paſtimes, they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes repreſented before his palace: if they had to giue or receiue any money, all did paſſe through his hands: in ſuch wiſe, that it was neuer ſéene in <hi>Rome,</hi> that any man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the title of an Emperour, enioyed ſo great portion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empire.

The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is thus come to paſſe, the Gods permitting, or my ſorrowfull deſtinies procuring, I am fallen into ſo great hatred of Seuerus, and in ſo cruel contempt and enimitie with Baſſianus, that in recompence of al my ſeruice which I haue done them all the dayes of my life, they are nowe determined to take away my life. Thou ſeeſt now, Saturninꝰ, whether it be reaſon that I endure the ſame, whereunto if I ſhould giue place, I ſhould periſh, my houſe ſhould be loſt, the gods vnſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, the whole Empire eſcandalized: and therefore it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient, that I execute on them that which they would execute vppon mee: for that it is more conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant vnto reaſon, that the euil be corrected of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good, then that the vertuous ſhould come vnder the power of the wicked. Behold Saturninus, what affection I beare thee, that haue layd vp in thy breaſt ſo great a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete, this terrible deede I will put into thy handes: therefore preſently thou muſt depart vnto the Court, and go into his chamber, where Seuerus ſleepeth, and cut off his head: &amp; from Baſſianus his ſonne alſo thou

Thou ſhalt ſay vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> guard, at Court, that euen nowe there came vnto mee a poſt out of Aſia, and art ſent by mee, to giue Seuerus intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence thereof, and goeſt at ſuch an houre, for that daunger dependeth thereon. And ſince thou haſt not beene abaſhed to heare it, be not terrified to performe it: for that I ſweare vnto thee by the immortal gods, that after Seuerus is dead, and I in the poſſeſſion of the Empire, conformable vnto the great perill where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in nowe thou doeſt aduenture thy ſelfe, ſhall be thy rewards that then thou ſhalt receiue.</p>

Great was the admiration of <hi>Seuerus,</hi> when hee heard what <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turninus</hi> ſaid: and yet moſt true, that preſently hee mighte not beléeue the ſame, or could thincke that ſo vile treaſon might be conteyned in <hi>Plautianus</hi>: but rather y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his ſonne <hi>Baſſianus</hi> had béene the inuenter thereof, to lead him into diſdaine and hatred againſt <hi>Plautianus. Baſſianus</hi> being lodged within his father, at his voyce did awake and came foorth, whome his father <hi>Seuerus</hi> reproued &amp; blamed with words very ſharpe, for the inuention of ſo great euill: and ſware (by the immortal Gods) to receiue him from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth into his further grace and fauour, in the way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, for ſo great an impietie: for <hi>Plautianus</hi> was not a man to haue any ſuch thought in his heart. And as <hi>Baſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> had not heard the beginning of <hi>Saturninus</hi> ſpeach, ſo was hee abaſhed to ſée his father ſo gréeuouſly offended: wheruppon <hi>Saturninus</hi> ſeeing the incredulitie of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Seuerus,</hi> &amp; how entirely he loued <hi>Plautianus,</hi> puld foorth his writing, wherein hee was commaunded to kill both him &amp; his ſonne: and further, did humbly craue, that <hi>Plautianus</hi> might be ſent for, with aduertiſement, that <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerus</hi> and his ſonne were ſlaine, and then it ſhould be ſéene that he would come apparelled not in ſilk, but in yron.

               <p>
                  <q>A long time was <hi>Seuerus</hi> reprehending <hi>Plautianus,</hi> putting him in remembraunce of all thinges which he had done for him, and in eſpeciall, ſo many &amp; great diſpleaſures which he had paſſed for his ſake, and had aduaunced him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all perſons in the Empire, and aboue all the reſt, had reuenged him of all his enimies. After <hi>Plautianus</hi> had a little recouered himſelf, he bowed his knées before his lord <hi>Seuerus,</hi> and with teares began to craue pardon for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, promiſing amendment in time to come, ſaying: that for his owne cauſe, hee ought to pardon him, although hee wanted all deſeruing for any mercie, but to take away all occaſion of reporte in the Empire, that euer he had fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo wicked a perſon. Beholding <hi>Plautianus</hi> teares, the promiſes which he made, the hoarie head &amp; beard that he ſo tare, and the great loue that he had borne him, <hi>Seuerus</hi> was in a maner determined to pardon him: but in the end, being found to be clad in a ſhirt of male, wheron <hi>Baſſianus</hi> laying his hand, ſaid. <hi>Tell mee Plautianus, into princes chambers at ſuch an houre as this, do ſeruauntes enter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled in ſilke, or armed with yron: I ſweare vnto thee by the immortall Gods, ſince thou bringeſt yron to kill vs, thou ſhalt here die with yron.</hi> And hardly had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded theſe woords, when he began to ſtab him with his dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, whoe preſently fell downe dead, and was beheaded: whoſe head was fixed vppon a launce ouer the port of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtia,</hi> the body deliuered vnto boyes to trayle alongeſt the ſtreates of <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XVII. ¶ Of the particular vices and vertues of Seuerus.</head>
               <p>THe newes being ſpread throughout <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus</hi> was dead, al the people tooke great pleaſure: and no leſſe would haue ioyed, if <hi>Plautianus</hi> had ſlaine <hi>Seuerus</hi> and his ſonne <hi>Baſſianus</hi>: for that all thrée were ſo euil wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the common wealth, that the leaſt euill which they would them in the common wealth, was but death. The offices that <hi>Plautianus</hi> held in the common wealth, <hi>Seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> diuided amongeſt the Tribunes, ſimple and plaine me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and not giuen to trouble: but the loue and fauour which he had vnto <hi>Plautianus,</hi> he neuer after committed vnto any perſon: for as afterwardes he ſaid, he knew not whome to truſt, ſince his priuate and fauoured ſeruaunt <hi>Plautianus</hi> would murther him. <hi>Plautianus</hi> being dead, there was none that might ſuffer or indure y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cruelties of the prince <hi>Baſſianus,</hi> or follerate his tyrannies: for <hi>Baſſianus</hi> ſtoode in awe of <hi>Plautianus,</hi> partly for that he was his father in lawe, as alſo for that he had bred him from his infancie. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerus</hi> conſidering his ſonnes <hi>Baſſianus</hi> &amp; <hi>Geta</hi> to increaſe in age, &amp; decreaſe in wit, cauſed wilde beaſts to be brought for them to kill, horſes to runne, inuenting new playes to practiſe, &amp; therein to occupie their perſons, diuerting their mindes to thoſe games, to reinoue them from vices.
<q>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no profite to lead his ſonnes to vertue by thoſe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like exerciſes, he would cal them in ſecrete, and tel them of many old examples how ſuch and ſuch princes were caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by diſcord: and that the ſame miſchance muſt happen vnto them, if they did not behaue themſelues as friends, &amp; fauour eche other as brothers: for that <hi>with concord ſmal things increaſe, &amp; by diſcord great things came to nought.</hi> Beſids that, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two brethren were ouerthwart in maners, and peruerſe of conditions, (as before hath beene ſaid) their
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:3692:168"/>
tutours did them much hurt: that is to ſay, in diſſembling their vices, &amp; inciting them to greater enimities: whereof <hi>Seuerus</hi> being aduertiſed, ſome of them he baniſhed, ſome he diſpatched, &amp; ſome he drowned in welles: affirming that they deſerued more puniſhment that kindled enimities, then the perſons that did execute them.</q>
                  <hi>Plautianus</hi> left a daughter, that was wife vnto <hi>Baſſianus,</hi> and her ſonne ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phue vnto <hi>Seuerus,</hi> and ſonne vnto <hi>Baſſianus</hi>: as well the mother that was young, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne which was a child they baniſhed into <hi>Sicyl,</hi> giuing them of al that which they had, no more but to ſerue them wherw<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to eate: which <hi>Seuerus</hi> did, not for enuie that he bare to his nephue &amp; daughter in law, but not to offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his ſonne <hi>Baſſianus, Seuerus</hi> did vaunt himſelf, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his predeceſſours had bin of a citie in <hi>Africa,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Tripol,</hi> which he did nobilitate, not only in buildings, but alſo in rents &amp; priuileges, and pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted there and orchard of Oliue trées, which did yéeld ſo great quantitie of oyle, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was ſufficient for a great part of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Italie, Seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> was a friend of wiſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, fauoured, ſtudious, &amp; delt very well with ſuch as were learned: but ioyntly with this, hee did moſt abhorre them, if they were either ouerthwart, or troubleſome: for he vſed to ſay, that <hi>fooles ſet neighbours at variance, but men that were wiſe &amp; malicious brought kingdomes together by the eares.</hi> He was alſo inclined to read books, and to vnderſtand antiquities: &amp; if he might not by his important affaires read himſelfe, he made others to read: and further, if he chaunced to be ſo buſied, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might not read himſelfe, either heare reading at ſuch times they read vnto him when he was eating or whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he went to bed.
<q>He himſelfe did write his owne life, &amp; did write it as truly as if he had béen a chronicler that is to ſay praiſing his vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, &amp; reprehending his vices: and alſo moſt truly, made report of all men that he kild, but not of the ſmal reaſon y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had ſo to do. <hi>Seuerus</hi> was much blamed for his great co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetiſe of goods, &amp; for want of care &amp; neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his honour: for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his wife <hi>Iulia</hi> was a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon adultereſſe, whom he did neither chaſtice, or put away: neither is it written, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:3692:168"/>
he did aduiſe or blame her.</q>
                  <q>It was ſufficient for <hi>Seuerus</hi> to know his wife to be euil, to be named <hi>Iulia,</hi> whiche name was euer infamous amongeſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Rome.</hi> Although he were an enimie of vices, and of vicious me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, much more was he enimie of théeues, aboue all other kinde of wicked people: and ſo is it ſaid and found of him, that he did beare with many malefactors, but neuer pardoned any théefe. In his apparel he was not curious or coſtly, but alwaies was apparelled as a man of great ſobernes: eſpecially, much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, that in his Empire he neuer beheld any perſon in <hi>Rome</hi> clad with ſilke or purple. Alſo in his féeding he was not diſordinate, &amp; yet truly of certaine fruits of <hi>Africa</hi> giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to féede ſomewhat ouermuch, and vſed to ſay, that they had a better reliſhe then others: for that being a child, hee was bred with them. Hée delighted alſo more to eate fiſhe then fleſh, and ſometimes paſſed an whole moneth without the taſt of any fleſh: the fleſh that he beſt loued was mutton, &amp; of fiſh, the Trout. In many cities of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empire, they made by his comaundement very notable woorkes: eſpecially in the citie of <hi>Tripol</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> where he was borne, he made there a fort, &amp; an houſe, &amp; compaſſed it with a very ſtronge wall. He was a prince very careful, that the citie of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould alwayes be well prouided, which was manifeſted at his death, at what time they found vij. yeares prouiſion in wheat and oyle.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>SEuerus</hi> being ſettled in ſecuritie, and intending certaine buildinges in <hi>Rome,</hi> receiued letters from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gouernour of great <hi>Britaine,</hi> which now is named England, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a great part of the Iſland was reuolted from the ſeruice of <hi>Rome</hi>: and to appeaſe &amp; force them to obedience, his preſence was right neceſſarie: becauſe the Prefect himſelfe was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denied al obedience, but they ſought meanes alſo to kill him. <hi>Seuerus</hi> was not diſpleaſed with this newes, although he were both old and ſickly: for that he alwayes deſired the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:3692:169"/>
offer of great things to magnifie his fame, and perpetuate his memorie. <hi>Seuerus</hi> alſo was pleaſed with thoſe warres, to haue occaſion to withdraw his ſonnes from the vices of <hi>Rome</hi>: and ſo it came to paſſe, that his elder ſonne <hi>Baſſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> he made captaine of the armie that he led by land: &amp; to his younger ſonne <hi>Geta,</hi> he gaue the charge of his armie &amp; nauie that paſſed by ſea. <hi>Seuerus</hi> at the ſoudeine and vnpro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uided, aſſailed the <hi>Britaines,</hi> who at that inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode of his arriuall in the Iſle, ſent their Ambaſſadours: partly to yéeld accompt, and partly to diſcharge themſelues of their rebellion, as alſo to ſet downe betwixt them a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine concord, which <hi>Seuerus</hi> would neither yéeld vnto, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide to heare off: for he vented rather to obteine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> renoune of <hi>Britaine,</hi> then for any reaſon to make them warre. His armies being diſimbarked, &amp; the Ambaſſadours diſpatched, euery man prepared, the one to offend, and the other to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend: <hi>Seuerus</hi> firſt prouided bridges, wheruppon his horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men might paſſe, &amp; his foote men auoyd occaſion to ſwim.
<q>The <hi>Britaines</hi> of that part of <hi>Britaine,</hi> in thoſe dayes, had a cuſtome in time of warre, to encounter their enimies in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes &amp; waters, where they did place themſelues vp vnto the arme pits, and from thence did fight and ſhew their ſkil: &amp; when their enimies did ſhoote or whirle their dartes, they would ſtoope or diue vnder water: in ſuch wiſe, that it cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thrée ſundrie times, that neuer happened in any part of the world: which is to witt, that 100. naked men, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came 1000. armed perſons. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at any time they would fight in the field, they vſed certaine targets after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of bucklers, &amp; halfe ſwords girt vppon their bare fleſh.</q>
All matters apperteining vnto the warres brought vnto perfection, <hi>Seuerus</hi> confirmed his younger ſonne <hi>Geta,</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of a certaine place of the Iſland that had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled, and kept his elder ſonne <hi>Baſſianus</hi> néere vnto his owne perſon: executing cruel warres vppon the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who vppon determination to doe hurte, or offend their enimies, dyed with great hardineſſe: and vppon other determination, would put themſelues to flighte: in whiche
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:3692:169"/>
flight their enimies alwayes had the woorſſe.</p>
               <p>The warres being trauerſed after this manner, the gowt did grieuouſly increaſe vppon <hi>Seuerus,</hi> in ſuch manner, that he could neither go out of his campe, either ſitt in counſel with his capteines: in ſo much, that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to commende the whole charge of the armie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſonne <hi>Baſsianus,</hi> who more did practiſe ſecreately to frame hatred amongeſt the armies vnto his brother <hi>Geta,</hi> then to make conqueſt of the enimies.
<q>
                     <hi>Baſsianus</hi> ſo much reioyced of his fathers griefe, and had ſo great care to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite, that he ſawe no houre, wherein he wiſhed not his fathers death. Not meaning to leaue any euil vnperfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that touched an euil nature, adding euill vnto euill, he ſuborned the Phyſicians that did cure him, and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts that ſerued him, in ſuch wiſe, the one to ſerue him, and the other cure him, that if the gowte did not finiſh him, poiſon ſhoulde diſpatche him. Although no man ſaid vnto <hi>Seuerus</hi> any one woorde, he did well perceiue what his ſonne <hi>Baſsianus</hi> deſired: and ſo it came to paſſe, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the diſobedience which his ſonne did beare him, &amp; howe euil his ſeruaunts ſerued him, and howe ſlenderly his Phyſician did viſite him: although he were olde and ſickely, he died of pure ſorrowe, and melancholy. The laſt wordes which <hi>Seuerus</hi> ſaide, before he dyed, they ſaye were theſe.</q>
                  <hi>When I tooke the Empire, I founde the common wealth throughout the worlde in trouble, and nowe I dye, I leaue it in peace: and although I dye without power to teſtar ny firmar, yet I leaue the Empire firme vnto my two ſonnes Antonines: if they ſhal proue good, they remaine exactly made princes: and if they ſhal be euil, I leaue them nothing.</hi> Before <hi>Seuerus</hi> dyed, he commaunded two Fortunes of gold to be made, for either of his ſonnes one: becauſe it was the enſigne of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, to take away all occaſion after his death, for any of them, by him ſelfe, or for him ſelfe, to be aduaunced with the Empire, but equally to remaine in power and eſtate. This was the ende of <hi>Seuerus,</hi> whome his enimies might

               <p>After that <hi>Baſſianus</hi> and <hi>Geta</hi> his brother had repoſed the body of their father <hi>Seuerus</hi> in the temple of the Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> preſently they beganne to conſecrate his body, and to place his ſoule with the Gods, accordinge to the cuſtome of the <hi>Romans</hi>: whiche cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was not done, but vnto dead Emperours: and the order thereof was thus.
<q>Preſently vpon the death of an Emperour, the Senate did aſſemble to determine, if hee deſerued to be buried with the Godes, either els after his burial to leaue him to obliuion as other men: and if he had beene euill, the Senate woulde be abſent at his buriall: and if he had bene good, all clad in blacke, woulde attend to conſecrate his body. And to do the ſame, their firſte at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was to bury the body of the deade prince without any ceremonie, and then made him an image of woode af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of a ſicke and colourleſſe man, which they placed alofte vpon a ſcaffolde ouer the Courte gate: and that image, although it were of a ſicke man, yet did they clad it with garmentes of ſilcke and golde, as though the counterfeite were aliue. In the hight of that ſcaffolde, or throne, the Senate were ſet on the lefte hande, and on the right hand all the matrones of <hi>Rome</hi>: of whome none might he apareled richly, either deckt with iuels of gold or ſtone: <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

At which newes, the matrones did grite and ſhriche, and the Senatours did wéepe and waile. This order they vſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen dayes together, but firſt vpon the ſixt day, the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians did forſake the ſicke perſon, and finally, on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth day manifeſtly would publiſh his death: preſently after he was denounced for dead, placeing the handles of the baire whereon the Image of the dead was laide vpon their ſhoulders, the chiefeſt and moſte honourable Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours on horſſebacke did beare the ſame: and after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner went vnto the place named <hi>Vaieia,</hi> and might not go by any other way but by the ſacred waye, whiche was a tracke where no man durſt paſſe, but Emperours that were dead and prieſtes that were aliue. In that place named <hi>Vaieia,</hi> there was another buylding made of ſtone, after the manner of a Throne, hauing on bothe ſides de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées and ſtaires to mount aloft, where they did place the Image of the dead Emperour: vpon the one ſtaires, ſtoode children, the ſonnes of the gentlemen of <hi>Rome,</hi> and on the other parte ſtoode the damſels and virgins of <hi>Rome,</hi> and there did ſinge many ſorrowfull ſonges and hymnes, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the praiſe of the dead.

On the day in which this ceremonie was perfourmed in <hi>Rome,</hi> they did concurre to beholde the ſame from all partes of <hi>Italie</hi>: and euerye Lord and ladie that was preſent, did throwe vppon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées of that Throne, Myre, incenſe, aloes, amber, roſes,

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:3692:173"/>
in the ſacred palace: not ioyntly, but parting the lodging betwixt them, euery one placing porters by them ſelues, and their gard to attende vpon them. Although their lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging was one, yet their willes and diſpoſitions were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers: and ſuche as had to deale in matters of importance, conferred not with them, but with their mother: who tooke the opinion of the one, and ſo of the other, whiche af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes was perfourmed by aduiſe and conſent of the Senate: becauſe otherwiſe the common wealth ſhoulde haue runne at randon and be loſt.

The diuiſions euery day proceedinge from euil to woorſe, it was beyonde all mennes powers, to bring them agreed, or make them friendes: they bothe deuiſed, without aduertiſement of

               <p>The heartes of theſe two Princes were ſo muche paſſioned, and ioyntly therewith of nature ſo indurate, that when the mother did talke vnto them, it ſeemed not, but that they were thinking of ſome other matter: which had moſt perfect apparaunce, becauſe at that time they were neither moued with compaſſion of her teares, either afterwardes did take any profite of her counſell. The mother only profited not in her traueile to reconcile them, but that from thenceforth th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

When <hi>Baſsianus</hi> perceiued, that he might not (by any meane) diſpatche his brother <hi>Geta</hi> with poyſon, and ioyntly therewith, that the <hi>Romanes</hi> were ſomewhat inclined vnto him by affection, determined on a daye, when all perſons were moſte inclined to ſléepe at after noone, to go vnto the lodging of his mother <hi>Iulia,</hi>

with whome <hi>Geta</hi> remained: and finding them at their reſt, he gaue <hi>Geta</hi> ſo many ſtabbes with a dagger, that he was bereft of his life. When <hi>Baſsianus</hi> ſet vpon his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Geta,</hi> the mother to ſaue him, caſt her ſelfe vppon him: notwithſtanding he ceaſed not to wound him, and kill him, The caſe was thus, that with one blowe he both wounded his brother, and imbrewed the garment of the mother: and finally, the brother remained dead, and the mothers garments defiled.</p>
               <p>This done <hi>Baſsianus</hi> goeth foorth through al the court, exclaming with a loude voyce, and with greate feare and trembling: <hi>treaſon, treaſon, my brother Geta would haue ſlaine me by treaſon in my bed, and if I had not leapt out at a windowe, and the deſtinies beene fauourable vnto mee at that inſtant, I had not eſcaped with life</hi>: and not ſatiſfied with that which was ſaide, he commaunded his garde to conduct him out of the court, and to garde and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende him vnto mount <hi>Celius,</hi> where the Pretorian bands were lodged, infourminge that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> palace there was no ſafetie: for that his brother had attempted to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him.</p>
               <p>All men that heard the exclamation that <hi>Baſsianus</hi> made, did beléeue that all things had paſſed as he had ſaid: and the Eſquiers of the bodie did accompanie and attende him, vntil they had brought him amongeſt the Pretori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: and entring the tent where they had their armour and pendons, knéeling vppon his knées, hee gaue greate thankes vnto the Gods, that had preſerued him vnto that place: and alſo vnto his garde, that had ſuccoured him in time of ſo great néede. To beholde <hi>Baſsianus</hi> go at ſuche an houre, with ſo greate an heate, through the middeſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that with ſo great furie, all that beheld him were eſcandalized: and did imagine amongeſt them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, that he had ſlaine his brother, or done ſome vile déede vnto his mother in lawe. Aſſoone as he ſawe him ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt the Pretorians, he diuided amongeſt them, two thouſande &amp; fiue hundreth drachmes of golde, according

The fame being divulgate throughout <hi>Rome,</hi> and the trueth knowen of the great treaſon which <hi>Baſsianus</hi> had committed, <hi>Geta</hi> his friends ioyned to ſéeke him, with a determined purpoſe extremely to haue reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Geta</hi>: and as the matter was put to armes, and came to hande gripes, <hi>Geta</hi> his friendes being the fewer in number, were ſoone ouercom: which although they were ſubdued, yet truely deſerue no diſpraiſe: being but fewe in number, ſéeing their Lorde dead, and <hi>Baſsianus</hi> in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the armie, they wanted no hardineſſe to fight, &amp; no leſſe courage to dye: but what ſhall we ſaye, but that if their quarell were iuſt, their fortune was verie croſſe. <hi>Small aduantageth it that the minde be generous, and the bodie warlike, if he that taketh armes be vnfortunate: for that one houre of happie fortune, is more woorth then all policies of warre.</hi> Greate was the compaſſion that all men conceiued of the cruell death of <hi>Geta,</hi> and no leſſe was the hate which they did beare vnto <hi>Baſsianus,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to kill him vppon ſo greate aſſurance, but alſo to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him in a place of ſo great priuiledge, that is to ſaye, within the ſacred palace, &amp; imbraced within the breaſtes of his mother. When <hi>Baſsianus</hi> ſawe that his brother

A greate quantitie of thoſe treaſures <hi>Baſsianus</hi> diuided amongeſt his Pretorians: who ſeeing themſelues riche in money, and that their enimies were ſubdued, went into <hi>Rome,</hi> began to enter into the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and killed all perſons with whome they had vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: but that which was more odious, vppon wagers would kill a whole kinred, vntil they left no perſone, in whome any remembrance might remaine.</q>

               <head>CHAP. VI. ¶ Of a certaine ſpeach vſed of Baſſianus vnto the Senate, excuſing himſelfe of the death of his brother Geta.</head>
               <p>ALthough in age I am but younge, and in mine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptes reputed as raſh, yet I ceaſe not to confeſſe that I am in great hatred with the people: and that my death ſhould as much content them, as now my life is diſpleaſant vnto them. And as princes are in the view of all perſons, ſo are all their works iudged of al men: and from thence it procedeth, that their iuſt attempts are praiſed of many, but their errours condemned of all. They that preſume to iudge the woorkes of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are not alwayes ſo iuſte, that they iudge continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conformable vnto iuſtice: for as many times they praiſe the prince with lies: ſo it may happen, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they accuſe them with malice. One of the extremeſt tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:3692:178"/>
that princes haue, is: that ſuch as throng in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to talke of our liues, and to examine our deeds and actes, they talke not as we liue, but as we vſe and deale with them: for if we honour &amp; magnifie them, they report we be no princes, but gods: but if we cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe and bring them downe, they ſay wee be no men but furies. Many times princes do chaſtiſe many, not becauſe we delight to puniſh, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſo agreeth with the imperiall authoritie ſo to be done: for as with rewardes and pardons wee magnifie our pierie &amp; cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie, ſo it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient, that with rigorous chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wee make our iuſtice to bee eſteemed. Many preſume to iudge the vices of princes, which if they were princes, would not onely commit thinges wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of iudgement, but alſo iuſtly to be depriued of the Empire: for the knowledge of good gouernement, is not a thing that men obtaine of themſelues: but a gift which the Gods do giue vnto whome they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>There is no prince ſo abſolute or diſſolute, that at the leaſt, in his gouernment deſireth not to be iuſt: but what ſhall wee doe, that haue no more power but to wiſh to do well? and the gods onely to giue grace to gouerne well. But comming to the caſe now chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, for which the whole multitude with me be eſca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized: I ſweare by the immortall gods, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if the truth as it was were manifeſted, I ſhould be found without blame: but I am of the one part ſo vnfortunate, and of th other part the multitude is ſo variable, that it many times happeneth, that of my manifeſt actes they ſay nothing: and of that which neuer paſſed my thought, they accuſe me. O ye iuſt gods, vnto you all I appeale as witneſſes: who firſt would haue kild y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, either whether my brother Geta would haue ſlaine mee, or
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:3692:178"/>
I would haue ſlaine him: for ye well vnderſtand, that being repoſed on my bed, he entered vpon me with a naked ſword: with which hee would haue drawne forth my ſoule, if by chaunce I had not found one at my beds head. If hee was the beginner of that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, and that fortune would fauour me at that inſtant, wherefore being vtterly without any fault, ſhould I be blamed of all perſons in Rome? What greater te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie would ye of my innocencie, but reſpecting that hee being the perſon that offended, and I the man that defended my ſelfe, the gods haue brought vppon him, that which hee ment to perfourme on mee: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in any good iudgement may it be conteined, that if by malice or enuie I would haue ſlaine my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I ſhould execute the ſame by ſtealth, and within the ſacred palace, for that in ſo enorme a caſe, I deſerued not ſo much chaſtiſement for the deede, as to committe the ſame in the place where that was done.</p>
               <p>I will not denie, that vnto my brother I was not bound to honour him, loue him, ſuccour him, and to deale well with him: but I will not confeſſe that I was bound, for all treaſons and iniuries to ſuffer him: for as it is honourable for great princes, to diſſemble &amp; pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iniuries, that are done to them by their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours: ſo neceſſarie is it for them to reuenge the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteſies and diſpleaſures, done vnto them by their betters or equals. It is notorious vnto al men, that in times paſt, many princes of the Romaine Empire had brethren, with whom they might not endure, but that many of them were ſlaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or at the leaſt driuen out of the Empire: for in fine, there is none of ſo great temperaunce, that in caſe of commaundement,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:3692:179"/>
would haue a companion: no not his brother.</p>
               <p>Conſider the behauiour of Remus and Romulus, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius and Germanicus, Titus and Domitian, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus and Lucius, &amp; others infinite that were brethren: amongeſt whome, vppon the point of commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and gouernement, there aroſe ſo great diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and vnkindnes: not as though they had beene natural brethren, but as moſt cruel enimies. O fathers conſcript and friends, giue thanks vnto the Gods, that haue preſerued your prince ſafe &amp; ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. for that with out cauſe they would not haue giuen him his death, and conſerued my life: for the workes of our gods are ſo profound, ſecreate, and vnknowne, that althoughe wee ſee what they doe: yet wee ſee not the end why they do it. Amongeſt all the gods, onely Iupiter is he that hath dominion, and ſo amongeſt al men the god Iupiter would not, but that onely one ſhould poſſeſſe the Empire: for it were no leſſe monſtruous to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the Empire by two perſons, then one body to haue two heads. If for all the Heauens, one God be ſufficient, and for all Bees but one king, and all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers be gouerned with one heart, &amp; all birds haue but one guide: I demaund of you my friends, to gouerne the common wealth of Rome, if one man be not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient? As we haue read in bookes of our forefathers, and as we haue ſeene in our dayes, there is nothing more conuenient vnto the Romane Empire, as to be gouerned by one only perſon: for that we haue ſeene more warres raiſed, vppon which prince ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, then for any diſobedience of ſubiects. Howe fierce warres were raiſed betwixt Silla &amp; Marius, Caeſar and Pompeie, Auguſtus and Marcus Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Galba and Othos, Othos and Bytellus, Bytellus
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:3692:179"/>
and Vaſpaſianus: &amp; now of late betwixt Seuerus my father, and Iulianus and Albinius. All theſe great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, whiche the miſerable common wealth of Rome hath ſuffered, was not for that many would not be commaunded: but for that many would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund. Admitting that my father commaunded in his teſtament, that Geta my brother and I ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide the Empire: yet many doe know, &amp; they are not fewe which preſume, that he would neuer haue done it, but his wife and my mother in lawe conſtrained him ſo to aſſigne: and in a caſe ſo great, hard &amp; graue, reſpect ought not to be giuen to that whiche hee did, but vnto that which he would haue done: becauſe the magnificence of the Empire, and the wiſedome of the Senate, ought not to be bound, to the procurement of a vaine woman: but vnto that which is moſt conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for the common wealth.</p>

And as the Emperour then being placed in the ſame chariot, although they ſaid no word to his offence, he receiued the cochemans iniurie as his owne: preſently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunding al his Pretorians which there did guard his perſon, to make ſlaughter at their libertie.

               <p>AFter that <hi>Baſſianus</hi> had ſéene the greate <hi>Ilion,</hi> and the moſte parte of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Bithynia,</hi> he came vnto the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Antioche,</hi> wher he was receiued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great ceremonie: and all the time that he remained there, no leſſe feaſted. From <hi>Antioche</hi> he tooke his way into <hi>Alexandrie,</hi> with greate deſire to ſée that famous citie, which the greate <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> had builte: whereof the citizens beeing aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they made moſte ſolemne &amp; coſtly preparation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to receiue him, which neuer had beene done to anie prince, either <hi>Greeke</hi> or <hi>Romaine</hi>: chiefly moued there vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, becauſe it was ſaide, that he was a friende vnto <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</hi> Manie leagues before <hi>Baſsianus</hi> came vnto the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they repaired the bridges, amended the high wayes, furniſhed all places with victuales, made manie ſummer houſes with boughes, and ſcattered all the wayes with flowers: and further, all his traine did take all thinges at their owne pleaſure, without paymente of anie money. But when he arriued in the citie, generally the <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drines</hi> came foorth to receiue him, in moſte gorgeous appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, accompanied with inſtruments and manie kindes of muſick. Preſently at his entrie into <hi>Alexandrie,</hi> he went on foote vnto the temples: where he offered verie greate ſacrifices, and burned therein great quantities of incenſe, myrrhe, aloes, and ſuche other fumes.</p>
               <p>This beeing done, hee went to viſite the ſepulchre of
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:3692:183"/>
the greate <hi>Alexander,</hi> where he vſed an imperiall magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, that is to wéete, he put off a moſt rich robe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was clad, he tooke from his cappe a brooch of greate price, a curious collar from his necke, from his breſte a ſtone of value ineſtimable, and from his fingers all his rings: &amp; knéeling vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground did offer the ſame vpon the ſepulchre of the greate <hi>Alexander.</hi> Incredible was the ioy that the <hi>Alexandrines</hi> conceiued, to behold a liuing prince of <hi>Rome,</hi> to haue a <hi>Greeke</hi> prince which was deade in ſo greate veneration: in reſpect whereof, they loued him with all their hartes, and ſerued him with all their power.</p>
               <p>All whiche thinges <hi>Baſsianus</hi> performed, not of intente to honour <hi>Alexander,</hi> or to pleaſure the <hi>Alexandrines</hi>: but with more certintie to aſſure him ſelfe of them all, and afterwardes ioyntlie to kill them all. Manie dayes had paſt, ſince <hi>Baſsianus</hi> had borne greate hatred vnto the <hi>Alexandrines</hi> and the occaſion of his vnkindneſſe was, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe it was ſaide, that they ſcorned him with words, and alſo derided him in enterludes: ſaying, it was a ſcoffing matter for him to make co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <p>The caſe was thus: the feaſts beeing finiſhed, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded proclamation to be made, that al the luſtie young men, either ſtraungers, or natiues of the countrie, ſhoulde muſter in a fielde, to the ende he would ſee, viewe, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo arme them after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> olde manner: ſaying, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence foorth his will was, that al his men of warre ſhould fight, not after the order of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> but according to the faſhion of the Greekes.</p>
               <p>Greate glorie, and alſo vaine glorie poſſeſſed the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandrines,</hi> when they hearde theſe proclamations: and
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:3692:184"/>
he that might ſooneſt, came firſt into the fielde: concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, that ſuch as were the wordes of the crier, ſuch ſhould be the workes of the Emperour. All the youth of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> remaining in the fielde, <hi>Baſsianus</hi> with all his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie in armour iſſued forth to beholde them, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to bring them ſelues into a ſquare, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end, that one by one, ſhoulde paſſe before him, of whome he woulde take his choyce and preſently after giue them armour. Nowe when the miſerable <hi>Alexandrines</hi> ſtoode all as ſheepe together vnarmed, <hi>Baſsianus</hi> gaue a ſigne vnto his ſoldiours, to giue the charge as vpon enimies: who in their ſlaughter made ſo great haſte, that within an houre, thoſe fieldes were all couered, not with flowers, but with dead bodies.</p>
               <p>Greate was the hurte that <hi>Baſsianus</hi> committed that day vpon the <hi>Alexandrines</hi>: for that he lefte the widowes without ſonnes, graundfathers without nephues, vnckles without couſines, brethren without brethren, and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours without friends: in ſuch wiſe, that none remained that was not ſlaine, or elſe tormented with the death of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The place where <hi>Baſsianus</hi> committed this greate treaſon, and ſo inhumaine crueltie, was in a broade plaine fielde neare vnto the greate riuer <hi>Nilus</hi>: and the number was ſo greate of them which were ſlaine, that the bloude by ſtreames ranne through thoſe fieldes, and ſtayned and died that riuer <hi>Nilus</hi>: in ſuch extreme manner, that that ſo ſtately a riuer ſemed not to runne with water, but with bloude. The <hi>Alexandrines</hi> may not be excuſed of their faulte, in ſpeaking euill of <hi>Baſsianus,</hi> defameing his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; repreſenting his vile factes in enterludes. <hi>Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that of euil we can ſpeake but euill, yet princes enter not into this reckoning, whoſe workes we haue licence to iudge onely in our hartes, but not with the toung to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme and deſpiſe them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And albeit the offence of the <hi>Alexandrines</hi> was verie great, yea, though it had béene much greater, yet without compariſon, muche more vehement was the crueltie that

                           <p>The famous auncient Romanes, and many of the principall of my predeceſſours, came from the Weſt into Aſia, onely to make warre vppon this thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: but I come not to make thee warre, but to ſeek peace, and to this peace, both thou &amp; I haue to ſearch a meane, that it may be perpetuall: for otherwiſe, a iuſt warre were more ſafe for princes, then a fayned peace. As wee read in bookes, and heare of our forefathers, there is not a more briefe and ſounde waye, for greate enimies to growe to bee faithfull friendes, then by recouering newe aliance by the waye of marriage: for in true and faithfull marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as the married be ioyned in bodies: ſo be they lincked and confederate in heartes and mindes. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome Princes haue married with the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Conſuls and Senatours, and admitting they haue ſo done, I will not ſo doe: for that I was borne a prince, and am a prince, and will dye a prince: wherefore, I will not marrie but with the daughter of a Prince. When congruently or aptly it may be done, it agreeth not with the maieſtie of the Empire, that the Prince this day ſhould holde him for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in lawe, whome he helde yeſterday for his vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall. Although the wiues of Princes vſe not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde and gouerne, yet we muſt graunt, that when
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:3692:185"/>
Princeſſes be the daughters of high Princes, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended of royall bloud, the people and ſubiectes are more honoured, ſatiſfied, and pleaſed: and ſuch bring foorth children more noble and generous. The Empire of the Romanes, and the Empire of the Parthians, are two the moſte renoumed Princes throughout the whole worlde: for, notwithſtanding the one at times hath ſubdued the other: yet neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely had the one lordſhip of the other. I am prince of the Romanes, and thou art Prince of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians: if thou wilt marrie thy daughter with mee, with greate good will I would matche with her: and after this manner, of two diuided Empires wee ſhall make one in concorde. Theſe two Empires beeing ioyned, may there be any kingdome that will diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them? or any king that ſhall dare to ſaye againſt them? I demaunde not thy daughter for her beautie, for there are others muche fairer in mine Empire: neither doe I requeſt her for thy richeſſe, for I haue ſufficient, neither doe I craue her, to recouer more vaſſals: for I haue kingdomes ynough ſubiecte vnto mee. But I do it, becauſe of auncient enimies, wee might frame our ſelues immortall friendes: in ſuch wiſe, that as hitherto we haue had you in contempt, as barbarians, from hencefoorth wee ſhall behaue our ſelues as brethren.</p>

y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> prince, which refuſeth the requeſt of men in peace. Thou ſayeſt that the chiefeſt meane to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme peace is, for princes to practiſe marriage betwixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. I denie not, but that in ſome perſons it is moſte true, but it is no generall rule for all men: for we daily ſee betwixte moſte neare kinred and alies, moſte greate quarelles and ſcandals to ariſe. My greate graund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father was father in lawe vnto kinge Arſacidas, and afterwardes the one ſlewe the other in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fielde: and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> verie ſame we heare reported to haue chaunced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you: Pompey married with the daughter of Iulius, and afterwardes Iulius ouercame and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Pompey his ſonne in lawe: in ſuche wiſe, that the marriages which they made to conſerue peace, did awake and inflame them to more cruell warre. The Prince that hath feare of the Goddes, and is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie giuen to peace, may not finde a better meane to obtaine the ſame, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be quiet in his owne realme: for, ſpeakinge the verie trueth, the prince that is ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with his owne proper eſtate, needeth not to ſeeke affinitie in ſtraunge kingdomes. Vnto my father were offered greate, noble, and mightie mariages fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtraunge kingdomes: whereunto he woulde neuer conſente, either hardely indure to heare thereof: and woulde ofte ſay vnto me, that manie kinges and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes he had ſeene loſt by mariage in ſtraunge coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and therefore woulde not marrie me, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his owne kingdome: and ſaide, at the houre of his death, that if I woulde liue manie yeares in peace, I ſhoulde not abandon my children to ſtraunge marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages.</p>
               <p>I had three ſonnes, whiche nowe bee all deade, and there remaineth vnto me but only one daughter,

in whome remaineth all my hope: and if the Gods would, and my deſtinies permitte, I woulde giue her an huſbande within mine owne naturall countrie, whome I might eſteeme as my ſonne, and he me as his father: for my intent, is, not to giue her an huſband that hath much goods, but in his perſon greate wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe.</p>
               <p>To that which thou ſayeſt of the kingdoms of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, &amp; the Empire of Romanes, would do verie wel to be ioyned in one: thou haſt great reaſon in that which y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> ſayeſt, if it might be done with as great faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, as it is ſpoken: but how is it poſsible they may be made one, being (as they are) ſo ſtrange in nation? ſo diſtant in ſituation? ſo diſtinct in language? ſo diuers in lawes? and aboue all the reſte, ſo contrarie in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions? Since betwixt you and vs, there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie landes, countries, nations, hills, and ſeas: howe is it poſsible, the bodies beeing ſo diſtante, that the harts may be vnited? Wee are much better knowne vnto the Godds, then wee knowe our ſelues: and ſince they haue created vs, and ſeparated vs, the one from the other: howe is it poſsible for vs to liue, and enioy together? for by greate diligence that men may vſe, either power that princes may practiſe, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible for them to ſcatter that, whiche the Godds do gather together: or to ioyne that whiche they do ſeparate.</p>

If y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> wilt enter peace with mee, I will graunte it! If thou wilte that wee be brothers in armes, by othe I will confirme it! Finally, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte nothing betwixte thee and mee, but that thou

do not craue my daughter to wife: I am determined, &amp; wil not, for giuing my daughter a good marriage, leaue my countrie tributarie vnto ſtraunge people.

               <p>The captaines of <hi>Baſsianus</hi> armie were two <hi>Romanes,</hi> named <hi>Audentius,</hi> and <hi>Macrinus. Audentius</hi> was a ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical perſon, as concerning maters of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth: but verie expert &amp; valiaunt in warrelike affaires. <hi>Macrinus</hi>
                  <pb n="369" facs="tcp:3692:189"/>
contrarywiſe, in gouerning the common wealth, was wiſe and ſkilfull: but in martiall affaires, ſomewhat negligent, and not ouer fortunate. <hi>Baſſianus</hi> did like very well of <hi>Audentius,</hi> and no leſſe euill of <hi>Macrinus,</hi> and did not only wiſhe, but alſo ſaid of him much euill: murmuring that hée was negligent, a coward, vitious, an epicure, a glutton that did eate much, and drincke not a litle: and that at his comming to <hi>Rome,</hi> he would remoue him from all charge in matters of warre. <hi>Macrinus</hi> was a man very wel lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and in his ſpeach no leſſe reformed: and in all thinges that they ſaid vnto him, touching that which <hi>Baſſianus</hi> ſhould ſpeake of him, he aunſwered: that whatſoeuer his good lord had ſaid of him, was ſpoken of great affection, not to the end to defame him as an enimie, but to correcte him as a ſonne. Although <hi>Macrinus</hi> vſed this ſpeach openly, yet he had other matter in his hart ſecretly, as afterwards in the ſucceſſe of affaires it manifeſtly appeared: for, at ſuch time as <hi>Baſſianus</hi> would haue remoued <hi>Macrinus</hi> from his honour and eſtate, <hi>Macrinus</hi> diſpatched him of his life.</p>
               <p>The caſe was thus, that <hi>Baſſianus</hi> being inclined of his owne proper nature, to knowe ſecretes, not onely of men, but alſo of Gods, and diuels, alwayes fearing himſelfe, that by practiſe of ſome treaſon, they would take away his life, hée was neuer void of the conuerſation of Sorcerers, ſothſayers, and inchanters, to aduertiſe him how long hee ſhould liue, and what death hee ſhould die. Not ſatiſfied with ſuch Magicians, ſothſayers, ſorcerers, and inchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as did attend on his perſon in the warres, hee would ſend vnto the Prefect of <hi>Rome</hi> named <hi>Maternianus,</hi> to whome <hi>Baſſianus</hi> committed the credite of his ſecretes: writinge a letter vnto him with his owne proper hande, commaunding him, with great diligence and ſecrecie, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble Magicians, Sorcerers, Sothſayers, Inchaunters, and Aſtrologians, to know of them, not onely how long he ſhould liue, and how he ſhould die: but alſo to demaund of them, if there were any perſon within the Empire, that

deſired or procured to be Emperour. <hi>Maternianus</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all that, which his Lord <hi>Baſſianus</hi> had written vnto him: whether it were any magician or ſothſayer that ſaid it, either any enimie of <hi>Macrinus</hi> finding opportunitie for his purpoſe: <hi>Maternianus</hi> did write and aduertiſe <hi>Baſſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> that he had aſſembled all the ſorcerers, inchanters, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiners, magicians, ſotheſayers, aſtrologians and augurs: and that the reſolution of their counſell was, that if hee would enioy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empire, it were conuenient that <hi>Macrinus</hi> were ſlaine. At the inſtant when the poſt returned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his letters from <hi>Rome, Baſſianus</hi> was placed in his coche, to go foorth on hunting: &amp; not reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring what he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, either preſuming what might be writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaid vnto <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crinus,</hi> that he ſhould open and read them all: and if that he found therin matter of great importance, to conſult therin: and al other ſmal matters, that he himſelfe ſhould prouide aunſwere, and diſpatch. <hi>Macrinus</hi> reading theſe letters, as wel ſuch as were written vnto <hi>Baſſianus,</hi> as vnto himſelf, came alſo to read the letter of <hi>Maternianus,</hi> wherin he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed <hi>Baſſianus</hi> of the aunſwere which the magicians had giuen him, which is to ſay, that preſently it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient that <hi>Macrinus</hi> ſhould be put to death: whereof he was not a litle abaſhed, holding it for great good hap, that this ſecrete had chaunced into his onely handes, before any other perſon: for, at the inſtant that <hi>Baſſianus</hi> might haue read this letter, he would haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded <hi>Macrinus</hi> his head to flée from his ſhoulders. <hi>Macrinus</hi> doubting, that <hi>Maternianus</hi> might returne to write of the former matter vnto <hi>Baſſianus,</hi> and that, were it but for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cealing that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hee would ſhorten him by the ſhoulders, aduiſed to practiſe the death of <hi>Baſſianus,</hi> before he ſhould experiment the ſame on him.

Baſſianus</hi> being reſident in <hi>Careuca</hi> a citie of <hi>Meſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia,</hi> came foorth to viſite a temple of the Goddeſſe <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> two miles diſtant from the citie: and being conſtrayned vppon the way, to vnburden his bellie, hee entered the thickeſt of the couert, accompanied but with one ſeruaunt: and <hi>Martianus</hi> that attended but opportunitie to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſh his promiſe, entered vppon <hi>Baſſianus</hi> being withdrawen into the thickeſt of the ſhrubs, proſecuting his neceſſitie al alone, <hi>Martianus</hi> ſtrake him with a launce downe flat vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ground: which wound was ſo mortall, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more woordes, or ſtrength to moue, where the launce went in, the life came out.

This was the end of the vnhappie Emperour <hi>Baſſianus,</hi> whoſe life did merite a ſlaunderous death: for that it was not vnreaſonable, that he which had kild ſo many friends, by treaſon ſhould be ſlaine with enimies.</p>

               <p>So generall was the ioye amongeſt the <hi>Romane</hi> people, to ſée <hi>Baſsianus</hi> dead, that they cared not to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Macrinus</hi> that ſhould ſuccéede, whether he were good or bad: becauſe, <hi>heartes that be tormented, and men that be deſpighted, when they hap to oppreſſe their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, conſider not ſo much of their profite, as they reſpect their reuengement.</hi> Tenne dayes after <hi>Macrinus</hi> ſawe him ſelfe Emperour, <hi>Arthabanus</hi> king of the <hi>Parthians</hi> gaue him battell, to reuenge the iniurie which <hi>Baſsianus</hi> had done vnto him: this battell betwixt both partes was ſo contended and ſo bloudie, that the victorie on that daye remained on neither ſide: yet leaſt was the loſſe vnto the <hi>Romanes.

               <p>The caſe was thus, that being ſetled in <hi>Antioche,</hi> he gaue héede vnto no other matter, but to the vſe of the Bathe, trimming his head, annoynting his bearde, going on hunting, proſecuting gluttonie and exceſſe, giuing him ſelfe vnto women: and that which was woorſt, he fledde from affaires, and followed vices.</p>
               <p>When at any time <hi>Macrinus</hi> did iſſue foorth, to viewe
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:3692:194"/>

               <p>It was a lawe muche vſed and obſerued amongeſt the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that their Princes did neuer enter armed into the Senate, either vnarmed did viewe their Campes and armies: ſince in the one they did manage matters of peace, and in the other nothing but warres.

With none of the <hi>Antiochians,</hi> either with any perſon of all <hi>Aſia,</hi> did he conſent to haue conference, or to be ſerued at his table, either enter into his chamber, or ſléepe in his houſe: but after the manner of a tyraunt, with his owne he ſtoode vppon his guarde, and with ſtraungers not a little ſuſpicious.</p>

               <p>The money which <hi>Macrinus</hi> receiued of his rents, or were preſented him from the cities, he conſumed them all in vices: and on the other parte, he woulde neither paye what he owed, or ſuccour his men of warre: in ſuche wiſe, that the people ſtoode in deſpaire, and the armies (for want of paye) no leſſe deſpighted.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romanes</hi> were afflicted with no ſmall griefe, to beholde the tyraunt <hi>Macrinus</hi> in all his déedes and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and to ſée howe the <hi>Aſians</hi> deſpiſed him: for they

hurt redoundeth to Princes by holding their armies diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, then to encounter their armed enimies.

Wée haue ſaid, how in that countrie, there was a temple dedicated vnto the God <hi>Heliogabalus</hi>: which in buildings was verie magnificent, and of prieſts much populated. Many <hi>Romane</hi> captaines, went many times to viſite that temple: ſome to ſée, ſome to pray, and ſome to offer ſacrifices: for that, naturally, the <hi>Romanes</hi> preſumed to be great worſhipers of their gods, and to hold their te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples in ſingular reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

The matrone <hi>Meſia</hi> was ſo diſcreet, ſecret, and aduiſed, that the children being of the age of fiftéene yeres, neither them ſelues, or any other for them, did either knowe, or ſuſpect, who were their fathers, either who their grandmother: but that ſhée ſayd vnto all men, that thoſe children were orphans, and ſonnes vnto her auncient ſeruaunts.

<q>In the courte of eight emperours, by the ſpace of 53. yeres, the great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone <hi>Meſia</hi> had béene reſident, with all which ſhée vttered of her ſelfe ſo great valure, and yealded ſuch eſtimation of her perſon, and alſo of them recouered ſo great gaine, that when <hi>Macrinus</hi> did reiect her from the court, ſhe had more riches in her exile, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:3692:196"/>The matrone <hi>Meſia</hi> departed vnto <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> where her two nephues remained, namely <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> and <hi>Alexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>: and as there remained manie <hi>Romane</hi> gentlemen e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill payed and worſe pleaſed, ſo they ioyned with <hi>Meſia,</hi> and <hi>Meſia</hi> with them, to talke and murmur howe <hi>Macri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> had ſlaine, by treaſon, his lorde the Emperour <hi>Baſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,</hi> and made hauock of the Empire &amp; common wealth: whiche matter was moued amongſt perſons that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to remoue this miſchief, and on the tyrante alſo to take vengeance. The matrone <hi>Meſia</hi> receiued excéeding ioy, to heare with her owne eares, and ſee with her eyes, howe all the armie was bente againſt the tyrant <hi>Macri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>: and their greateſt care was, to finde a man ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and of merite meete for the Empire: becauſe the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> ſtoode with him in great and cruel hatred, for want of pay, and the matrone <hi>Meſia</hi> no leſſe grieued with her exile. The matrone <hi>Meſia</hi> beholding her ſelfe in ſo good &amp; apt aſſembly, to make her nephue <hi>Heliogabalus Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Emperour, called in great ſecrecie, ſixe <hi>Romane</hi> cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the chiefeſt of the armie: all which were of great authoritie, and no leſſe grauitie. Vnto theſe ſixe captaines <hi>Meſia</hi> ſayd in ſecrete, howe her nephue <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> was ſonne vnto the Emperour <hi>Baſsianus,</hi> and <hi>Semiamira</hi> her daughter: and that ſhée had helde him hidden in <hi>Aſia,</hi> for doubt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empreſſe <hi>Iulia</hi>: who (had ſhe knowne it) would haue ſlaine the childe, and baniſhed the mother. <hi>Meſia</hi> was not only ſatiſfied to ſay &amp; certifie theſe vi. captaines, that the Emperour <hi>Baſsianus</hi> moſt truely was father vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that younge man, and nephue vnto her ſelfe: but ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therewith, ſhe brought them into her chamber, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered vnto them an huge maſſe of golde &amp; ſiluer, whiche ſhe promiſed, and ſware vpon the altars of the temple, to diſtribute totally vpon the armie, if they woulde giue the <hi>Romaine</hi> Empire vnto her nephue.</p>
               <p>Vnto theſe ſixe captaines (to whome the matrone <hi>Meſia</hi> had committed this ſecreate, and diſcouered this treaſure) ſhee both promiſed and ſware, to bringe to paſſe

Greate wiſdome was vſed by the matrone <hi>Meſia,</hi> in this matter of ſo greate importance, eſpecially in the choyce of ſo honourable captaines: whoſe credite was ſufficient to frame the whole armie to perfourme the ſame. Of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, princes and greate potentates may collecte, that <hi>in anie affaires, there is not greater daunger, either more ſafetie, then ſoundly to conſider, in to whoſe hands they commende their cauſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Pretorian bands being euill intreated, and worſe payde, great was their ioy, when they hearde that <hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabalus</hi> was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne of <hi>Baſsianus,</hi> for whom the grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther craued the Empire: whome they all accepted, and bound them ſelues to receiue for their Emperour: not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be reuenged of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyrant <hi>Macrinꝰ,</hi> but alſo to poſſeſſe the money. For ſo much as the temple where he was Prieſt, was without the citie, agréement was made betweene the matrone <hi>Meſia,</hi> and the armie, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the ſame night (notwithſtanding it were verie late) both her nephue and alſo her owne perſon, by ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth and deuiſe ſhould be conueyed ouer the wall into the citie, that at the breake of day, they ſhoulde ſeaze the citie, and aduaunce <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> vnto the Empire. Neither was the matrone <hi>Meſia</hi> ſlack to acompliſh their requeſt, either was there anie wante in the promiſe made by the Preto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians: but that <hi>Meſia</hi> and her nephue approching to the foote of the wall, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> purpoſed engins mounted them ouer into the citie: the young man being placed amids the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi> captaines, beléeuinge him to be the ſonne of <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſianus,</hi> by reſemblance of his face, and by a marke in his hande, as <hi>Baſsianus</hi> had.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romane</hi> armies receiued greate ioy, to beholde <hi>Meſia</hi> and her nephue <hi>Heliogabalus</hi>: chiefly, to ſee the

The great matrone <hi>Meſia</hi> (as a woman that dealt in affaires both daungerous and eſcandalous) would firſt aſſure the Empire vnto her nephue, before ſhée departed from her treaſure: and the caſe was thus. Shée framed all the principals of the armie, preſently to ſweare vnto <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> as their onely Emperour, &amp; to kiſſe his hande as their naturall Lorde. A matter moſt truely verie marueilous, and no leſſe worthie to be commended vnto memorie, namely, the diſpatche and diligence vſed by <hi>Meſia</hi> in one night: moſte manifeſtly apparant, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſixe houres, ſhée brought forth her nephue from the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, paſſed him ouer the wall, did yeald him credite to be the ſonne of <hi>Baſsianus,</hi> obteined their othes as vnto their Emperour, kiſſed his hand as loyall ſubiectes, diuided her treaſure amongſt the armies, fortified them ſelues in the fortes of the citie, and brought the whole hoſte into ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. At the breake of daye, in euery tower they did ſound their trumpets, placed their Standards and Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, bothe on bulworkes and corteines, and with loude voices exclaimed through all ſtreates: <hi>Viua, viua el Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perador Heliogabalo, hiio del buen Baſsiano</hi>: that is to ſaye: happie and long life vnto the emperoure <hi>Helioga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balus,</hi> ſonne to the good <hi>Baſſianus.</hi> This béeing done &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed, <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> came foorth into the citie, neither on foote or on horſe backe, but vppon the ſhoulders of the moſte auncient and honourable of the armie, wearing the imperiall crowne vppon his head, and holding the royall ſcepter in his hande, and haueing vppon his ſhoulders, the enſigne of <hi>Auguſta,</hi> &amp; before him the pendon of the Eagle: becauſe theſe were the enſignes whereby the emperours of <hi>Rome</hi> were knowen. And now, after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtandards were placed, and the ſtrength of the citie poſſeſſed, the armie
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:3692:197"/>
publiquely proclaimed, and receiued the Emperour <hi>Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogabalus</hi> for their lorde and Emperour: preſently, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed matrone <hi>Meſia</hi> did yelde vnto them all her trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, both ſiluer and golde, without breache of any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or reſeruing of any one Iewell.

               <p>THE tyrant <hi>Macrinus</hi> was ſettled with greate ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, in the citie of <hi>Antioche,</hi> when they remoued him from the Empire in <hi>Phoenicia</hi>: for ſo it hath béene, is, and ſhalbe, that <hi>when Princes moſte greedily doe proſecute vices, then their enimies are weauing ſome webb of moſt deadly daunger. Heliogabalus</hi> was not the full age of ſeuentéene yeres when he was aduaunced to the Empire: when <hi>Macrinus</hi> in <hi>Antioche</hi> heard the newes of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whiche was don in <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> he fell into a great laughter, &amp; made a ieſt of it: chiefely, being certified to be ſo very a childe, &amp; framed by his grandmother <hi>Meſia,</hi> whome he helde bothe for a woman ambitious, and alſo contentious.

                           <p>Here I am aduertiſed, that in the offence of the Gods, &amp; vnto my great want of reuerence, thou haſt attempted with mine armies, to eſtabliſh a newe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour: which deede exactly declareth thee to be (as in deede thou art) a woman both ſeditious, and alſo ambitious: ſince thou knoweſt that by meanes of thy toung and mutinie in the common wealth, I did ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe thee my houſe. Alſo they ſaye, that the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour which thou haſt made, is a boye, a prieſt, a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard, and thy nephue: whereunto there is no more to be aunſwered, but that I ſhal chaſtice thee as a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and him as a childe: that is to ſaye, commaund him to be whipt, &amp; thy ſelfe to ſpinne. I ſweare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee Meſia (by the immortall Gods) that if thou driue mee to take my lance in hand, I will force thee to put thy diſtaffe vnder thy girdle: for vnto women (ſuch as thou) it were more honeſtie to be ſpinning, then to practice mutinies amongſt ſouldiours. Alſo it is ſaide vnto me, that thou haſt giuen infinite trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures vnto mine armies, to moue them to reuolt from mee, and to elect thy nephue Emperour: theſe with the reſt, be the fruites of thy guyle: for that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:3692:198"/>
of thee, and neuer of any other, it is ſaide, or ſhall be ſaide, that thou haſt robbed the Empire, to buy the Empire.</p>
                           <p>If all princes paſt had knowen thee as I do knowe thee, neither would they haue giuen credite vnto thy woordes, or faith vnto thy fained workes: but as by thy guileful diligence in their ſeruice, and preſuming attempts in their affaires, thou didſt commaund their houſholdes, and gathered the fruites of their goodes. I haue heard thee many times boaſt thy ſelfe, that thou waſt borne in the houſe of Marcus Aurelius, nouriſhed with Antoninus Pius, and didſt dwell in houſe with Commodus, Pertinax, Iulianus, and Seuerus, Princes very glorious: which if thou hadſt remembred, thou wouldeſt neuer haue committed a deede ſo vile: for there may not be in the whole worlde a deede more vnſeeming, then for him that was bred in the palace of kings, to committ treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a perſon of ſuch maieſtie. If it ſhall hap the Gods to permitt, and my ſorrowfull deſtinies ſo to direct, that in this enterpriſe I loſe both honour and life, I can ſaye vnto thee Meſia, that which hiſtorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers, who ſhall write of thee and mee, with trueth may ſaye, that the Empire came vnto mee by election, but to thine through treaſon. If thou hadſt beene a woman of honeſtie or honour, thou wouldſt not ſo openly haue defamed thy daughter Semiami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, whome thou chargeſt to haue accompanied Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſianus, and of her bodie this boye Heliogabalus to haue ſproung, for whome nowe thou procureſt the Empire: becauſe in the houſes of bluſhing faces, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and noble heartes, they more eſteeme an ounce of honour, then all the wealth and eſtate of this life.
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:3692:199"/>
Oh Meſia, howe greate an errour haſt thou made in this thine enterpriſe, onely to reuenge thy rauenous heart, and to make thy nephue an Emperour? name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thou haſt raiſed a ſlaunder vppon Baſsianus, defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the royal palace of inceſt, diſhonoured thine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt daughter Semiamira, blemiſhed the Empreſſe Iulia of vnhoneſt conſent, &amp; not ſtained but imbru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thine owne fame, with the filthie couerture of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous adulterie. And ſince Baſsianus, Iulia, Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amira, and Seuerus haue ended their dayes: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wilt thou (oh traytreſſe Meſia) diſhonour ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that be dead, to honour but one that is aliue? Nowe I knowe (oh Meſia) howe tedious and peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous it is, for quiet men to deale with mutinous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and paſsioned as thou art: who hauing no yron to hurte our fleſhe, yet committeſt deedes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame vs, and ſpeakeſt woordes to torment vs. Of this treaſon which thou haſt committed againſt me, I doubt not to be reuenged, and my heart throughly ſatiſfied: for ſo greate an offence is treaſon, that if it be in men to offende therein, the Gods haue onely charge to reuenge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. It is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me alſo to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that this thy nephue was a prieſt in the temple of the God Heliogabalus: in which matter I do not entermedle and ſay little, ſince in this iniurie ye haue not committed offence vnto men, but vnto the gods: but ioyntly therewith I dare ſaye vnto thee, that ſince thou haſt drawen him foorth of the temple, where he was conſecrated vnto the Gods, thou ſhalt neuer enioy good dayes of him: for that of thy parte, to haue done ſeruice vnto the Goddes, of Princes thou ſhouldeſt haue made prieſtes, and not of prieſts Princes.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="389" facs="tcp:3692:199"/>The Gods demaund nothing which we haue, but if by chaunce wee offer any thing vnto them, they like it not, that wee ſhould returne to take it awaye: for which cauſe I ſay vnto thee, and from hencefoorth, do prophecie (O Meſia) that for ſo muche as thou haſt drawne foorth thy nephue from the holy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he ſhall loſe the Empire, and thou thy money. The confidence which thou committedſt vnto the men of warre, by diuiding amongeſt them ſo greate quantitie of golde and ſiluer, I hope in the immortall Gods, ſhall all conclude in ſmoke: for it is an aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cuſtome among the Romane hoſtes, not to giue the Empire to the perſon of moſte merite, but vnto him that payeth beſt. The matter that moſte grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth mee (O Meſia) in this traiterous enterpriſe, is, to thinke, that I being a man, and a Romane prince, muſt deale, fight, and contende with a woman: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there may not bee in this whole worlde an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall deſpight, then for a man to arme him ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a woman, whoſe weapons are but woordes.

In Princes palaces, and in all citizens houſes, all vices are couered, or at the leaſt, ſhadowed, except the perſon that is ſeditious, or foule and liberall tounged: which is, not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, but much leſſe to be hidden.

In that thou ſayeſt that I robbed the Empire to buye the Empire, proceedeth of vile ſlaunder, and no leſſe falſhood: ſince thou, Macrinus, doſt know moſt certainly, that to obteine riches, I needed not rob the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth: becauſe my patrimonie is very great, my huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d left me rich, my ſiſter Iulia gaue me al her treaſure, my Lord Seuerus ceaſed not to giue me mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, the Conſul Furius mine vnckle, gaue me a yeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtipend, &amp; for al men for whom I ſued, ſomewhat was preſented me: in ſuch wiſe, that I had alwayes to giue, and at no time founde my ſelfe in neceſſitie to craue.

               <head>CHAP. VI. ¶Howe the tyraunt Macrinus was ſlaine in battell.</head>
               <p>AFter that <hi>Meſia</hi> had written her letter, and diſpatched <hi>Macrinus</hi> meſſengers, ſhe conferred with the principal Captaines of the armie: vnto whom ſhe diſcouered what <hi>Macrinus</hi> had written, and how ſhe had anſwered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame: who were not a litle gréeued with the diſcourteſies that it conteyned, and greatly commended the aunſwere whiche <hi>Meſia</hi> had made. And as <hi>Macrinus</hi> had ſaid in his letter, that the <hi>Romaine</hi> hoſtes did vſe to giue the Empire, not vnto the perſon of moſt deſeruing, but vnto him that beſt did pay them: ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Romaine</hi> captaines were not therewith

a litle deſpited, preſently ſwearing, not once but many ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, that <hi>Macrinus</hi> might not ſatiſfie that iniurie with leſſe coſt, then with the loſſe of his head. <hi>Macrinus</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no ſmall error, in baniſhing <hi>Meſia,</hi> but much more in writing that letter, but moſt of all in charging the armies with ſuch an outrage: for that it was the totall occaſion, for <hi>Meſia</hi> to recouer more fauour, and <hi>Macrinus</hi> to loſe his credite.
<q>Of this ſo notable example, princes and other great potentates haue to take example, that when their people or vaſſals ſhall be altered, or mutined, very much to conſider, not only what they do, but alſo what they ſay and write: for that <hi>in rebellious times, more hurt is done with a word or a letter, then at another time with a notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie.</hi> The Matrone <hi>Meſia,</hi> with her exile not a litle grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and with the letter no leſſe diſpleaſed: neither would ſléepe by night, or reſt by day: prouiding thinges neceſſarie for the warres, and diſpatching poſts for <hi>Italie</hi>: for her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was, to ſuſteine her eſtate in <hi>Aſia</hi> with armes, and in <hi>Rome</hi> with letters and promiſes.</q>
This citie which <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> poſſeſſed, was of 2000. houſholdes, where ſhe made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of engins wherewith to whirle, and bulworkes to defend: and further, gaue commaundement, that the moſte valiante perſons, and moſt cheyſt capitaines ſhould remaine within the ſame: not onely to reſiſt, but alſo to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend. When <hi>Macrinus</hi> read the letter that <hi>Meſia</hi> had written, and was aduertiſed by his meſſengers, how pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, and without alteration ſhee read his letter, he was not a little gréeued therewith: for he had opinion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone <hi>Meſia,</hi> that ſhee had ſkill to diſſemble iniuries, and after in proceſſe to reuenge the ſame.</p>
               <p>The Prefect of <hi>Macrinus</hi> armie, was a valiaunt Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, named <hi>Iulianus,</hi> whom he ſent with his greateſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer vnto the citie which <hi>Meſia</hi> and her nephue <hi>Helioga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balus</hi> did poſſeſſe: giuing commaundement, that he ſhould trauel to take them aliue, to performe his promiſe whiche he had ſworne: which is to witt to ſet <hi>Meſia</hi> to ſpinne, and her nephue to bee whipt. <hi>Iulianus</hi> was a Capitaine bold
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:3692:203"/>
and valiaunt, who beſéeging the citie, which he thought to be in diſtreſſe, more then it was, and giuing a furious aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, hauing ſkarcely mounted on the topp of the wall, the ſouldiours of the citie by plaine ſtrength pulled him ouer, cut off his head, and hanged it out on a tower. The mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe after that theſe thinges had paſſed, <hi>Meſia</hi> commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded certaine of <hi>Macrinus</hi> Capitaines, to be called into her preſence, who vpon aſſurance approching vnto the foote of the wall, ſaid vnto them theſe woords: <hi>that which I haue to ſay vnto you (my friends) is, that ye behold and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vppon this turret, the head of your ſorrowfull Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Iulianus: and ſay vnto your maiſter Macrinus, that the diſtaffe wherewith I ſpinne is that launce, &amp; that head is the call which I doe weaue and knit.</hi> When <hi>Macrinus</hi> heard the newes of the miſfortune that had happened vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Capitaine <hi>Iulianus,</hi> and what woordes the matrone <hi>Meſia</hi> had ſaid vnto the ſouldiers of his armie: hée ſaid (as it was reported) with a roring voyce: <hi>my deſtinies be fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, my houre is come, and my fortune is ended. Macri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> with feare had his courage ſo daunted, that ſecretely he began to practiſe with the matrone <hi>Meſia,</hi> to diuide the Empire with her nephue <hi>Heliogabalus</hi>: but being (as ſhée was) in ſo great readineſſe, &amp; no leſſe paſſioned, ſhe would in no wiſe accept, either as much as giue eare thereunto: and that, if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empire were to be diuided, it ſhould be with an Emperour, and not with a Tyrant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Macrinus</hi> perceiuing his offers to be reiected, his words deſpiſed, and his preſents nothing regarded, determined to make a proofe of fortune, which with the whirle of her va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable whéele, many times doeth wound without threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and ſometimes threateneth without wounding. <hi>Macrinus</hi> gathering and alſo paying his armie which hée had in the confines of <hi>Antioche,</hi> departed vnto <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> where hee camped very néere vnto the citie, which <hi>Meſia</hi> and her nephue <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> defended: who preſently ſent to giue <hi>Macrinus</hi> to vnderſtand, that hee ſhould not neede to take the paine to aſſault the towne, for that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:3692:203"/>
very fewe dayes they would iſſue to giue him battell in the field. Two <hi>Romane</hi> armies, and two <hi>Romane</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, were in <hi>Phoenicia</hi> one againſt another: <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crinus</hi> partie euery day diminiſhing, and the other not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſing but alſo preuailing: for that daily the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers parted from <hi>Macrinus</hi> vnto <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that hee was ſonne vnto <hi>Baſſianus,</hi> and did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him for their Emperour, &amp; kiſſed his hands as their natural Lord and ſouereigne.</p>
               <p>By the number that daily fledd from him, in their dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpeach which they vſed with him, in the fickle ſeruice which they did him, by his bands which daily diminiſhed, and by their weake courage in fighting: <hi>Macrinus</hi> did clearely perceiue, that hee might not obtaine victorie, but ſawe himſelfe to be in daunger of a ſale vnto his enimies. <hi>Macrinus</hi> counterfected a ſhew vnto his ſouldiers of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to fight, and yet was in great readineſſe to flye: for that at all times, when he iſſued to encounter or ſkirmiſh, he was mounted vpon an horſe of great ſwiftnes, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſguiſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meſia</hi> being aduertiſed, that <hi>Macrinus</hi> had greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the ſafetie of his life, then his honour or goods, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided to iſſue at the ſoudeine to giue him battel: the which although on both ſides was throughly imbrued in bloud, and not a litle daungerouſly contended, yet in the end, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crinus</hi> was put to flight, and ſtaied in a village, but with the loſſe of his head. This was the end and concluſion of the tyrant <hi>Macrinus,</hi> which vſurped the <hi>Romane</hi> domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on xiiij. monethes, and tenne dayes: who was ſo cruell (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all other vices) that amongeſt his owne ſouldiers he was termed, not <hi>Macrinus,</hi> but <hi>Macellinꝰ,</hi> which is to ſay, butcher: for that in reſpecte of the humaine bloud whiche hee ſhedde, hee more ſéemed a butcher, then a <hi>Romane</hi> Prince.</p>

Although the matrone <hi>Meſia</hi> in al other matters paſt, had diſcouered her great wiſedome, yet in this caſe aboue the reſt ſhe made a ſhew of her great prudence: for that (to ſay the truth) <hi>in rebellious times, &amp; amongeſt mutinous people, princes ought not to occupie themſelues in chaſtiſements, but in reconcilementes.</hi> All the capitaines of <hi>Macrinus</hi> that eſcaped the battell, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing howe <hi>Meſia</hi> commaunded by publicke proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that no man ſhould preſume to call them traytours, either vſe them with foule woordes, ioyntly aſſembled of their owne francke minds, to confeſſe her to be their ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne Lady: and to kiſſe the handes of <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> for their Emperour.</p>

This which I here relate (fathers conſcript) is, not to recouer praiſe, but to the end ye ſhould beleeue me: for if my perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poſſeſſe no credite, my embaſſage muſt needs haue iſſue of no effect. Speaking more in particular, I ſay: ye know that many yeares ſince my ſiſter and I departed Rome, attending on the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Baſſianus, and after that the traitour Macrinus had ſlaine him, Iulia his vnfortunate wife, ſo ſenſiblie did feele his death, that by extreeme ſorrowe ſhe fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed her life. Fortune would not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent to depriue me of my vital ſpirits, when my ſiſter Iulia was bereft of life: and this ſhe did, not to the end to forget mee, but
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:3692:205"/>
the more to greeue mee: becauſe in great perils and miſfortunes, if at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time fortune did diſſemble, it was not ſo much as to honour them, as afterwardes to bee reuenged of them. Of the death of Baſſianus my lord and your emperour, as it was in my hands to bewaile him, if it had beene as well to defende him, either hee had neuer died, or elſe had beene raiſed to life: for that moſt truly, although Baſſianus were yonge, vaine, fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle, abſolute, &amp; diſſolute, yet on the other part, he was patient, ſilent, and pitiful: and it might haue beene, in the burthen of greater age, he would haue forgotten y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vices of his youth. There is no confidence at al times in moſt wiſe men, either deſpaire in fickle yonge me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for that we ſee all day long, that many times age doth bring forth fruite, where reaſon did not yeld as much as leaues. He that in deede laide hands on Baſſianus, was that caytiue Martianus: but he that commaunded him to be ſlaine, was the traitour Macrinus: a man moſt truly of baſe condition, infamous life, obſcure linage, an idiot in letters, intemperant in ſpeach, vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in maners, and a tyrant in his workes. Ye perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiue (fathers conſcript) that a man ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed, were a ſlaunder to be receiued &amp; accepted for a prince: for that in great eſtates &amp; Segniories, it is not ſufficient that their princes be valiant, but alſo honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: which is to wit, not to want proportion in their perſons, and to haue noblenes in bloud, of all whiche things Macrinus hath no poſſeſſion: for, besids that he is of obſcure linage, infamous of life, cruel of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition and falſe of promiſe: ſo had he a ſwarte viſage, and a dwarfs body, he was ſplay footed, &amp; alſo proare blind.</p>
                           <p>Macrinus was not ſatiſfied to haue ſlaine Baſſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, but alſo vſurped the Empire: and to heape euill

But as the Gods are iuſt in rewarding the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and not careleſſe to chaſtice the wicked, &amp; that the election of men, being not confirmed of the gods: my nephue Heliogabalus and I, haue herein vſed ſo great ſkill, that at the time when the tyrant Macrinus was moſt abandoned vnto the vices of Antioche, wee cut off his head: in ſuch wiſe, that Aſia was ſet free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his tyrannie, and the death of Baſſianus well reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged. The armies that were ſcattered, diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented, diuided, and euil payed, we haue gathered together, payed, and vnited: and poſſeſſe all Aſia in obedience vnto the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire. Alſo (fathers conſcript) I wiſh ye to vnderſtand, that in the time of life, and alſo after the death of the tyrant Macrinus, the armies did elect my nephue Heliogabalus Emperour: which election I will not denie but that I deſired, practiſed, procured, and alſo bought: for that it ſeemed vnto mee, that the Empire being in the hands of ſuch a tyrant as Macri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, it was not bought, but redeemed. If in this marte of the Empire I haue offended, I wil yeeld my ſelfe to al maner of puniſhment: but therwith I would haue ye to vnderſtand, that I bought it with my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, openly of your armie, from a tyrant, farre from Rome, in a rebellious time, and for the ſonne of Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſianus: and I ſay for the ſonne of Baſſianus, which with moſt iuſte title ſhould haue inherited the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: if Macrinus had not vſurped the ſame.</p>
                           <p>Fathers conſcript, it ſeemeth not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue deſerued blame, much leſſe any chaſtiſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: becauſe by my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie

As your armies do heare report, and there doe write, they were ſo poore and in ſuch diſtreſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> more iuſtly it may be ſaid, not that I ſuborned but ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them with my monie: becauſe the more part had not to eate, nor garments to weare, adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>turing to rob vppon the wayes, and in townes to ſilch &amp; ſteale. And ſince my nephue is ſonne vnto Baſſianus, nephue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Seuerus, &amp; a young man of himſelfe in ſemblance of good inclination, it ſeemeth not that we haue erred in his electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, either ſhal ye ſwarue in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation: for that in life he reſembleth the father, and in courage and nobleneſſe of minde the graundfather. Neither is this election to be reproued, for his euil nourturing or doctrine: for as ye know, he was not trained in vices, but in temples: not with prophane men, but with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt prieſts: not robbing on high wayes, but offering ſacrifices: not ſheading bloud, but teares: not wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at large, but withdrawen: not perſecuting men, but ſeruing the gods. From a child of much infancie, I offered my nephue Heliogabalus to the gods in the temple: where he hath beene inſtructed to be milde, chaſte, ſilent, patient, ſober pitiful, and abſtinent: and if by hap, he ſhall proue otherwiſe then nowe hee is, it may be for the libertie that he ſhal obteine, and not for the doctrine which he hath learned,</p>
                           <p>All princes paſt haue beene elected onely of men, but my nephue both of Gods and men: for that I vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed him to doe ſacrifices, &amp; the Gods haue rendered him to gouerne kingdomes.

In Rome alwayes in times paſt, the prieſthood was diuided from the Empire: but ye ſee that whiche was neuer ſeene of your forefathers, namely, that the prieſt is an Emperour, and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour a prieſt: in ſuch wiſe, that with his ſacrifices, hee ſhal reconcile vs with the gods, &amp; with the empire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend vs againſt our enimies.

               <p>THe Embaſſadors being arriued, &amp; their Embaſſage alſo knowen at <hi>Rome,</hi> both the Senate and people were in excéeding admiration, when they vnderſtood of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great acts which <hi>Meſia</hi> had done in <hi>Aſia,</hi> &amp; heard of the letter that ſhe wrote vnto <hi>Rome</hi>: whereof many copies were made, and ſent to diuers townes &amp; cities. In <hi>Rome</hi> they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in great confuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vpon determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of an anſwere to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> demaund which the matrone <hi>Meſia</hi> had made, becauſe the Senate doubted her atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pts in time to come: in reſpect wherof they ſo deferd their aunſwere, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Embaſſadors co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plained vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Tribune of the people. By letters of her Embaſſadors, the matrone <hi>Meſia</hi> was aduertiſed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention betwixt the Senate and people, as concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection &amp; confirmation of her nephue <hi>Heliogabalus</hi>: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon preſently ſhe determined to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The winter being paſt, <hi>Meſia</hi> in the prime of the Spring ſayled into <hi>Italie,</hi> directing her courſe ſtreight vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> where ſhe was wel receiued, and no leſſe feaſted: although
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:3692:208"/>
it be moſt true, at that inſtant ſhee was more feared, then beloued: that ſhee was of ſo great ſkill, and of ſo much pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that ſhe moſt wiſely could diſſemble iniuries, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and also gratifie ſeruice. <hi>Meſia</hi> was ſo prudent and aduiſed, that neither in countenaunce, geſture, wordes or workes, ſhe did either ſecretly or openly, diſcouer any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt any perſon: but delt with all perſons as with her ſonnes, and honoured al men as her brethrene. All the <hi>Romanes</hi> were ſo pleaſed with the grauitie of her ſpeach, and the honeſtie of her life, that on a day the Senate &amp; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being conioyned, requeſted with great inſtance, that it might please her to accept the gouernement of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, ſince ſhe had therein ſo great experience, and that her nephue was in <hi>Aſia.</hi> To this demaund <hi>Meſia</hi> aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. <hi>Fathers conſcript, I do greatly gratifie your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, which vnto me appertayneth not: for that it rather agreeth, with the condition of women, to breede and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Emperours, and vnto men to gouerne Empires.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When theſe matters paſſed in <hi>Rome, Heliogabalus</hi> ſtayed in <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> attending an anſwere from his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother <hi>Meſia</hi>: who being aduertiſed that he was accepted in <hi>Rome</hi> for their abſolute Lord, &amp; ſouereigne Emperour, came immediatly vnto <hi>Antioch,</hi> with intent the yeare fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing to paſſe into <hi>Italie. Heliogabalus</hi> finding himſelfe eſcaped, &amp; fréely deliuered from the church, confirmed Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, diſpatched of the hands of tutours, abſent from his grandmother, and in poſſeſſion of libertie, to liue at his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, his euil inclination preſently appeared: becauſe the vertue (if he had any) of his former life, was but feyned: for <hi>the euill inclination of young men, may for a time be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <hi>but being at libertie, they cannot cloake it.</hi> The firſt inſolencie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> committed in <hi>Aſia,</hi> was, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he appareled himſelfe in a robe wouen w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> gold, ſilke, cotton, flax, &amp; woll, large downe vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foote, ſowen all ouer wyth pearles &amp; precious ſtones: and ſet a crowne on his head af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the maner of <hi>Thyara</hi>; bracelets on his armes, &amp; earings on his eares: in ſuch maner, that vnto the ſimple hee gaue
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:3692:208"/>
occaſion to gaze, vaine perſons to talke, and wiſe men to woonder. All that winter he gaue him ſelfe to learning, not of ſcience, but to playe on drommes, fluites, and ſuche other pipes, to daunce as a ſhepeheard, &amp; ruſtically to ſing as a man of the countrie, and to ieſt as a Iuggler: in ſuch wiſe, that for him ſelfe he ſought out ſchooles agréeable vnto the life which he meant to leade. The ſpring of the yeare béeing come, <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> departed towardes <hi>Rome,</hi> where at the porte of <hi>Hoſtia,</hi> his graundmother <hi>Meſia</hi> receiued him: and when ſhée ſawe her nephue, in ſuch libertie of life, and ſo ſtraunge in apparell, ſhée was touched with no ſmall diſgrace, in reſpect of ſuche <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> as did accompanie her: and no leſſe offended of the priuate and fauoured ſeruauntes that did attende him.</q>
The matrone <hi>Meſia</hi> was ſo wiſe in her counſels, and ſo aduiſed in her actes, that ſhée conferred with her nephue in ſecrete, crauing moſted inſtantly, that in no wiſe hée ſhoulde aduenture to enter <hi>Rome</hi> with that manner of garment: for that it might fall out, in beholding him in the habite of ſo ſtraunge attyre, they would bothe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine and be eſcandalized.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> gaue good eare vnto the counſell of his graundmother, but her requeſt he lefte vtterly vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed, which was vnto her no ſmall griefe and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: for that ſhée heard it with her owne eares, and the <hi>Romanes</hi> alſo ſaide it vnto her face, howe contrary the actes of her nephue were to the writing that ſhée had ſent touching him out of <hi>Aſia.</hi>

                  <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> béeing arriued at <hi>Rome,</hi> was receiued of the common people with greate ioye and ſolemnitie: but the auncient and noble perſonages of <hi>Rome,</hi> behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his preſumption in commaunding, his raſhe and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie ſpeache, his greedineſſe in féedinge, his ſtraunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in attyre, and vnſteddineſſe and wantonneſſe in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, could not ſatiſfie them ſelues with ſighing, &amp; much leſſe with murmuring.

                  <q>To

               <p>TO reporte at large all the vices of <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> were to emptie and drawe drie droppe by droppe the riuer <hi>Nilus,</hi> or to wade the great riuer of <hi>Danubie</hi>: becauſe they are ſo manie, ſo vile, and ſo ſcandalous, that it ſhoulde be ſhame to write them, and loſte time to read them. Of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny we ſhall write a fewe, and of the moſt vile the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt: to the ende, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all men whiche ſhall ſée or read this writing, may conceiue the deſerued blame of the <hi>Romains,</hi> to holde and ſuffer ſuch a beaſte for their Emperour: for that he was not onely vnméete to gouerne a common wealth: but alſo his life in him was moſte euill imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>We will write partly of his euil life, to diſcouer vnto men his euill end: for as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuine <hi>Plato</hi> ſaide, <hi>though men can
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:3692:209"/>
cloke and diſſemble others faultes: yet do not the Goddes pardon their iniuries.</hi> This vnfortunate Prince was vicious, abſolute, diſſolute, and (whereof we haue moſte to wonder) neuer weried in his wickednes: for, <hi>if vertue be tedious, vice is yrkeſome.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> entring the Empire, preſently his houſe was furniſhed with lyars, Iugglers, &amp; ieſters: vnto whome he neither denyed the entrie of his chamber, or the ſecretes of his houſe. <hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabalus</hi> greatly delighted to playe and repreſent the fable and ſtorie of <hi>Paris</hi> the <hi>Troyan,</hi> and the Goddeſſe <hi>Venus,</hi> who with his complices were clad in ſuch garmentes, as in the chiefeſt of their playe fell from them, and diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their nakedneſſe: that vnto all graue perſons, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was giuen of murmuring, and to all light perſons, of laughing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This déede was not onely of greate indignitie, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo eſcandalous to be repreſented of a Prince: for <hi>it ſufficeth not, that Princes be honeſt in their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: but they muſt not permitte either worde or deede that is vnhoneſt, to be ſaide or done in their preſence.</hi> They did yerely celebrate a certeine feaſt named <hi>Salabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> which continued thrée dayes, in the firſte day they were waſhed and let bloud, on the ſeconde they ſighed and were ſilent, and on the thirde they feaſted and reioyced in their moſte coſtly attyre, in the memorie of <hi>Adonides</hi> the greateſt louer that had béene in the worlde: the ende of this feaſt was, to repreſent the trauels, ſighes, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, graces and diſgraces, that louers ſuſteined before their ſouereigne delight was obteined. <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> had in his chamber a young man named <hi>Zotipus,</hi> of bodye, face, and geſture, verie faire and gracious: but of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and conditions no leſſe corrupted: for that in his woordes he was a lyar, in dealing double, falſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, periured of his othe, and malicious in all his thoughtes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> was oft aduertiſed of the words, déedes, and lewd life of <hi>Zotipus</hi>: but as affection did more reigne
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:3692:210"/>
in him, then reaſon, ſo could he neither be ſeperated from his conuerſation, or giue credit to anie reported that was ſaide of him, accompting gibes and ieſtes, gratious recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: guile, liuelineſſe of ſpirite: deceites, diligence: croſſe dealinge, paſtime: and malice, ſubtiltie. Verie worthy was <hi>Zotipus</hi> of chaſticemente, and <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> of much greater reprehenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: becauſe <hi>if princes haue licence to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the faultes of their fauoured ſeruants, they ought not to allowe and confirme them: for of great reaſon none ought to be ſo acceptable vnto the prince, that ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly dare aduenture to committe euill.</hi> At the time of his repaſte, he did manie times commaunde Philoſophers and orators to appeare in his preſence, not to diſpute of naturall cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but of vnchaſte adulteries. <q>At time of conference with
Ambaſſadours, Senators, or other graue perſons, he would either play with his handes, or twinkle and winke with his eyes, in ſuch wiſe, that ſuters departed with diſgrace, and not anſwered. As concerning women he neither ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red matrones, married women, virgins, or widowes: but that all ſuch as he fauoured, he either obteined, or elſe defamed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>In drinking he was alſo diſordinate, for at ſome times he woulde drinke water, ſomtimes wine, ſomtimes ale, ſomtimes ſider, ſomtimes ſodde water, ſomtimes golden water, ſome times ſtild water, and at other times hee woulde not drinke, but brothes and colleſſes. In the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his feeding, he neither vſed authoritie, or obſerued grauitie: for at ſome times, he woulde eate ſittinge in a chaire, ſometimes on a bench, and ſometimes walking: for he vſed to ſay, that in ſuch manner, he did both eate and digeſt. Naturally hee was giuen to ſleepe verie litle, through the weakeneſſe of his braine: and ſlepte in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces without reſpect, as well in the temple, as in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, in the garden, in the bath, in the bedde, and alſo in the market place: in ſuche wiſe, that hee wanted force to reſiſte the leaſte motions and affections of his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>

                     <p>My ſonne Heliogabalus, when thou departedſt from Aſia vnto Rome, I hoped to haue heard ſuch newes of thee, as might be ioyfull to thy common wealth, and haue giuen vnto mee greate renounce &amp; glorie: but as I am aduertiſed here, and alſo giuen to
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:3692:211"/>
vnderſtand from thence, there thou doeſt miniſter matter for all men to murmur: and here vnto mee ſufficient cauſe to weepe. Sixtie ſixe yeares are paſt ſince I was borne into this worlde, in which I haue buried and bewailed my father Torquatus, my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ariſtina, my ſiſter Phillis, and her huſbande Tharſus. Alſo I buried and bewailed my husband Ariſtippus, my ſonne Lucius Francus, my daughter Dolobella, and her husband Martianus. Alſo I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed and buried the good Emperour Marcus Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, and the Empreſſe Fauſtina my good and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Ladie: in whoſe houſe I was borne, and in whoſe palace I was married. I alſo buried and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed the Emperour Commodus, the Emperour Pertinax, Annius Paſtor mine vnckle, Mirtha mine aunte, Camillus my nephue, and Ioanna my neece. Alſo I buried and bewailed the Emperour Seuerus, my onely good Lorde and famous Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Alſo I bewailed and buried thine vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate father, my deare and moſte deſired ſonne: whoſe name I dare not, either any other, expreſſe in my preſence: becauſe the ſounde thereof conſtraineth mee to breake foorth in teares. I thought it expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent (my ſonne) to leade thee vnto remembrance of al theſe thy predeceſſours, to the ende thou mayſt ſee, howe ſmall reaſon it were, that I ſhould bewaile the liuing, ſince I haue wept all the dayes of my life, for ſo many perſons that are dead. When thou waſt borne by ſtealth, and I did both hide and couer thee: when I did remoue thee from Rome, and brought thee vnto Grecia: when I cauſed thee to be inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Greeke letters, and bred and nouriſhed thee in companie of wiſe men: when I did offer thee vnto
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:3692:211"/>
the God Heliogabalus, and made thee a prieſt in his ſacred temple: I thought (my ſonne) that all theſe thinges ſhould ſerue mee for ioye and peace in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed age: and not to bewaile thy childiſhe youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</p>
                     <p>In this I acknowledge, how free the iudgements of the Gods are from the thoughtes of men: in that the gods determine one thing, and men ſuppoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: which hath chaunced both vnto thee and to mee (O my ſonne Heliogabalus:) becauſe the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhneſſe which thou doeſt vſe, and the vices thou poſſeſſeſt, I did not onely thinke, thou wouldſt not committe: but alſo, that in thy minde they ſhoulde neuer haue had paſſage. When I did place thee with the greate prieſte Gorgias, cauſed thee to be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayled in the ſacred veſture, prayedſt daily vnto the gods, and alſo euery weeke diddeſt offer ſacrifice in the temple: I hoped thou ſhouldeſt haue proued a Paragon in vertue, and not (as thou arte) a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in all vice.</p>
                     <p>If thou wouldeſt conſider, many thinges do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade, and alſo binde thee to be good, but nothinge prouoketh thee to be euill: that is to weete<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be a man reaſonable, to haue beene a prieſt, to be borne in Rome, to be nowe an Emperour, to haue nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed thee in my houſe, and to be deſcended of bloud ſo noble and generous: for it much prouoketh men to perfourme that which they ought to do, &amp; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member from whence they be deſcended. Beleeue mee, my ſonne, that with leſſe coſt, and more eaſe, thou ſhalt be vertuous, then vicious: becauſe vices content the fleſhe when they are committed, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the hearte after they be perfourmed: but vertues
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:3692:212"/>
yelde not ſo much griefe in their woorking, as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure when we haue giuen repulſe vnto vice. I may not comprehende the froward fortune that foloweth thee, or the ſorrowfull deſtinies which haue purſued mee: ſince I nouriſhed thee in trueth, and thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt, and arte become a lyar: I bred thee chaſte, and thou arte imbrued with impudicitie: I brought thee vp in temperance, &amp; thou haſt ſtained thy ſelfe with exceſſe and gluttonie: I trayned thee in ſhamefaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and thou rendreſt a life moſte diſſolute: and that which is woorſt aboue the reſt, thou doeſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feare to offende the Gods, or eſcandalize men. Admitting thou wouldeſt not be good, for any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence vnto the Gods that haue created thee, or anye griefe or ſcandal vnto men with whome thou doeſt liue: yet oughteſt thou ſo to be, to remoue all heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse and diſpleaſure from mee thy olde and ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full grandmother: ſince thou knoweſt, I bought for thee the Empire, by the weight of money drawen out of my cheſtes, and by force of teares iſſuing &amp; brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from mine entrailes. My ſonne, thou doeſt well knowe, that to make thee a Romane Prince, I gaue greate giftes vnto the temples, offered vnto the Gods infinite ſacrifices, gaue vnto the Pretorians all my treaſures, made vnto the Prieſtes great offers, &amp; ſent vnto the Senatours moſte riche iewels, all which is nothing: for if it had beene poſsible, I would haue giuen my bloud vnto the immortall Gods, that thou mighteſt be one of them. And if I haue erred in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſeing the Empire, much more ſhould I erre to make thee one of the Gods, ſince in thee no vertue is to be founde, either any vice wanting. The Gods haue made thee faire of face, gallant of proportion,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:3692:212"/>
ſtout of ſtrength, learned in letters, expert in armes, valiant of heart, delicate in iudgement, and bolde in perils: but what profite all theſe graces, ſince thou art ſo greate an enimie of others counſel: and ſo farre enamored of thine owne proper iudgement? Thou followeſt vanitie, as one moſt inconſtant: thou doſt proſecute thine age, as one ouerchildiſhe: thou pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueſt ſenſualitie, as one moſt wilfull in follies: which thing for a while may be diſſembled, but long time may not be ſuffered: in ſuch wiſe, that either the Empire ſhal be loſt betwixt thine handes: or thou muſt dye within fewe dayes. As the ſeate of the Empire is conſecrated vnto the Gods, ſo they ſuffer not euil Princes long to reigne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which thou mayſt conſider in Tyberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Domitian, Commodus, Iulianus, Baſsianus &amp; Niger, al which had ſo euil an ende, that where the yron of the enimie entred, by the ſame place the ſoule departed. Oh my ſorrowful and vnfortunate ſonne Baſsianus: of whome vntil this time I goe laden with ſorrowes: and alſo thou haſt to holde it for moſt certeine, that ſince thou arte a diſciple of his euil manners, ſo ſhalt thou be alſo a follower of his moſt miſerable death. Being verie young, and as then but a childe, I hearde my Lorde Marcus Aurelius verie oft ſaye, that the immortall Gods did ſooner ſlaye euil Princes, then other wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſons: becauſe the euil man, is only euil vnto his owne houſe and perſon: but the euil prince liueth to the hurte of the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. I bought not the Empire, for any other cauſe, but chiefely to renue the memorie of the good Emperour Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Pius: but alas alas of mee? whoe greately feare
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:3692:213"/>
and alſo hold it for certeine, that as in Nero the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Caeſars finiſhed: euen ſo in thee the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere linage of the Antonines ſhalbe ended.</p>
                     <p>In the dayes that I remained at Rome, I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode, and ſince I came into Aſia, I haue alſo ſeene, that by the proſperitie of a good man, many be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced: and by miſhap of a wicked perſon, many finiſh and decaye.</p>
                     <p>I am aduertiſed, that in thy houſe and chamber, men of wicked life, and little wiſedome, haue free entraunce and familiaritie: which in princes houſes, is verie perillous, and no leſſe pernitious: for that ſuch perſons do procure thee to followe the counſels which they ſhall giue, and to diſſemble the exceſſe which they ſhall committe. If thou bee euill, and ſuch as attende thee be wicked: howe maiſt thou haue hardineſſe to chaſtice any euill? To refourme others, thou muſt firſte refourme thy ſelfe: and to chaſtice others, thou haſt firſte to puniſhe thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts: for that, if the priuate and fauoured ſeruants of Princes be diſſolute, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth doeth fall out to be abſolute. In the reigne of my lorde Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Aurelius, I ſawe his courte furniſhed with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous perſons, and in the dayes of his ſonne Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus, I ſawe his houſe filled with wicked people: and am well able to ſaye vnto thee, my ſonne, that as their houſes were, ſo was their common wealths. If thou wilt liue in quiet, go alwayes in peace, and auoide ſuſpicion: keepe in thine houſe continually men of honeſtie, grauitie, and wiſedome, becauſe honourable and wiſe men in Princes houſes, yealde authoritie with their perſons, and profite with their counſels.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="419" facs="tcp:3692:213"/>Nowe, or neuer, thou maiſt withdrawe thine hande, ceaſe to be euil, and binde thy ſelfe to bee good: becauſe of all that is paſt, we will impute the fault to thy youth: which if thou refuſeſt to do, then will wee referre it whollie vnto thy wilfull vanitie. It profiteth not a litle for the healpe of good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the common wealth, that the Prince be of good life: for ſubiects hauing good Princes, imitate what they ſee, and perfourme what they commaunde.</p>

                  <hi>HEliogabalus</hi> made certeine lawes, wherof ſome were good, ſome indifferent, and others neither good nor euill, but moſte vaine: for as he vſed to ſaye, <hi>ſo greate authoritie haue Princes in their kingdomes, as the gods in the heauens.</hi> He made a lawe that no veſtall virgine ſhould make a vowe of chaſtitie, but to ſtande at her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to be incloſed, or to be married: for he helde opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that women were verie weake to perfourme vowes: and at euery houre, variable of opinion and aduiſe. He made a lawe, that no widowe might marrie within a yeare of her huſbandes death: on the one parte ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to bewaile the dead, and on the other parte, exactly to conſider of him that ſhoulde marrie her. He made a lawe, that no fleſhe, breade, wine, or any fruite ſhoulde be ſolde in <hi>Rome</hi> by viewe, but by weight and meaſure: becauſe in ſelling of thinges by weight and meaſure, they are bought according to their value, and not as they are praiſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="420" facs="tcp:3692:214"/>He made a lawe that al taylers in receiuing garments to make, ſhoulde take the ſame by weight, to auoyd pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyning of any parte thereof. He made a lawe that no young man vnder the gouernement of father, mother, or tutour, might giue, take, or playe any money: becauſe it were to be preſuppoſed, that ſuch a one, being in no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of inheritance, had either ſtolne, or made ſome euil marte.

               <head>CHAP. XII. ¶Howe Heliogabalus was thrice married, and of his marrying of the Gods together.</head>
               <p>AFter that <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> was come from <hi>Aſia,</hi> he ſtayed in <hi>Rome</hi> an whole yeare without marriage: after which time he married with a gentlewoman of <hi>Rome,</hi> beautifull of face, and noble of bloud: and it well appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he rather married her for beautie, then noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: for that a yeare beeing ſcarcely paſſed, he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorced.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="422" facs="tcp:3692:215"/>He did not onely remoue her from all honour, but alſo caſt her out of his houſe, ſpoyled her of all her Iewels and apparel, and conſtrained her by ſpinning and weauing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly to get her liuing. The firſt wife being repudiate, he grewe enamoured of one of the veſtal virgins, whome he remoued out of the churche, and openly eſpouſed: for which fact, the Senate was not a little grieued, &amp; <hi>Rome</hi> no leſſe eſcandalized: becauſe the veſtal virgines, were offered in the temples vnto the Gods, and ſworne and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed to perpetual chaſtitie. After he vnderſtood the griefe of the Senate, and the murmuring of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, he moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one day into the Senate, and wiſhed them not to be ſorrowfull for his marriage with a veſtall virgin, for that if it were an offence, it were but an humaine offence: and being (as he was) a Prieſt, it apperteined not vnto him to marrie, but with a woman that were a Prieſt: and if that were not ſufficient, yet it ſufficed that he was a Prince and an Emperour moſte ſupreme, vnto whoſe greatneſſe it appertained to make lawes, without all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to obſerue them. More then a yere, and leſſe then twaine, he was married vnto this veſtall virgin: to whome, as to the firſt, he gaue a libell of diuorce: and the ſorrowfull woman came to ſo greate and miſerable po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, that if the other did obteine liuing by ſpinning, this did purchaſe the ſame by adulterie: in ſuch wiſe, that of a conſecrated virgin, and of a noble Empreſſe, ſhée be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a common adultereſſe. He married the third time with a widowe, and matrone of <hi>Rome,</hi> and for better occaſion he would oft ſaye, that ſhée was deſcended from the linage of <hi>Commodus</hi>: and that from thence foorth he would not take a wife, but of bloud very high, of beautie ſingular, and of condition moſte diſcréete. <q>
                     <hi>Heliogabalus</hi>
would oft ſaye, any Prince might eſcape errour in his firſt marriage: that is to ſaye, if ſhée were of baſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to eſtéeme her of no reputation: if ſhée were foule, to abhorre her: and if ſhée were fooliſhe, to kill her.</q>

                  <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> procéeded vnto ſo greate madneſſe, that
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:3692:215"/>
he did not onely deride humaine marriages, but alſo ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed at diuine matrimonies: for that he determined open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to marrie his God <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> and to celebrate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie with ſome other Goddeſſe. The caſe was thus, that the thing which the <hi>Romanes</hi> held vnder greateſt guarde, reuerence, and veneration, was the Image of the Goddeſſe <hi>Pallas,</hi> which was ſaide to fall from heauen vppon the walles of <hi>Troye</hi>: this Image <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> commaunded to be taken out of the churche, where ſhée remained hidden, and to be tranſferred vnto his houſe: and from the day that ſhée was brought from <hi>Troye,</hi> was neuer ſéene with mannes eye vntil that daye. He made a coche of plate ouer gilded, aloft whereon he placed the Goddeſſe <hi>Pallas,</hi> apparelled in riche robes, and charged with moſte precious iewels: one of the Oxen wherewith the coche was drawen, was white without any ſpott of blacke: and the other was blacke without any ſpott of white. <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> went before with a goad in his hande, guyding the Oxen, and turning his face alwayes towardes the Chariot, in ſuch manner, that ſtill to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the Goddeſſe, he marched backwardes. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> vnderſtanding, that <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> would that day playe the Carter, prouided from the imperiall palace vnto the temple, a broade and a ſandie waye, that in his backewarde walke he ſhould not finde whereat to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, much leſſe to fall. And when they were all come vnto the churche, they tooke the God <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> and the Goddeſſe <hi>Pallas,</hi> married them, and ioyned them as man and wife, and made them a right ſumptuous bedd in the midſt of the temple, where they ioyntly ſlept all that night. The <hi>Romanes</hi> receiued no ſmall griefe, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> committ ſuch follies: for that preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming (as they preſumed) to be ſo greate worſhippers of the Gods, it ſeemed vnto them that in making ſuch mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, was to deride the Gods: and it might happen, that what he did but in ieſte, they might repaye in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:3692:216"/>Nowe, when theſe Gods were eſpouſed, <hi>Heliogaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> woulde ſolemnize that marriage with ioyes: for which purpoſe, he commaunded the <hi>Circene</hi> playes to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared: wherin he commaunded infinite beaſtes to be ſlaine, and the fleſhe of them all, both good &amp; bad, to be eaten of all perſons: in ſuche wiſe, that there they did eate Lions, Beares, Woolues, Tygers, Vnicornes, Ounces, Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Aſſes, Doggs, Beeues, Buffes, &amp; other wilde beaſtes, Bores excepted, which they vſed not to eate in <hi>Phoeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> where he was bred and nouriſhed.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretely <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> commaunded an hundreth pitchars of flies to be taken, and being brought to the Court, he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted certaine <hi>Romanes</hi>: and being then Summer and time of great heate, and in chiefeſt of their dinner, he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his hungrie flies to be ſet at large, who with their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie gaue an onſet vppon the gueſtes, as vppon a campe of enimies, in ſuch wiſe, that the gueſtes gaue themſelues to flight, and the flies ſate downe to eate.</p>
               <p>On the day of the great feaſt of his God, all the ſacred Senate, and whole multitude of people, offering ſacrifices in the temple, and all the doores faſt ſhut, ſoudeinly he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be ſet looſe amongeſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> troups of people, an hundreth cattes, tenne thouſand rattes, an hundreth greyhounds, &amp; a thouſand hares: where the fighte and ſlaughter was ſo great, and the confuſion, rumble, and crie of people ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tréeme, that it ſéemed, hee went rather to ſcorne the Gods, then offer ſacrifices.</p>
               <p>The chamber where he ſlept, his Gallerie where he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, the place where he did eate, &amp; alſo diſpatche affayres,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:3692:217"/>
was alwayes ſwept, not with broomes of any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but of thréeds of gold: which office he gaue vnto one of the chiefeſt perſons of his Court. When he would at any time walke a litle on foote, it was not on hard ground, but
on ſand of gold. <q>
                     <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> was not ſatiſfied to weare ſhoes of any ſilke, or veluet, either of clothe of gold, or gold wrought with the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer: but the ſoles were of <hi>Vnicorne,</hi> and gold of <hi>Nilus:</hi> and the inſtep and vpper part therof ſet with pearle and moſt rich ſtones: in ſuch wiſe, that <hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabalus</hi> ſhoes were of more value, then the crowne of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar,</hi> or <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> He was much addicted to weare rings on his fingers, and ſometimes would weare them of braſſe, yron, lead, amber, and of leather: in ſuch wiſe, that this prince, the more to diſcouer his madneſſe, did weare ſhoes of gold, and ringes of lether.</q>
On a time there came from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> 10. ſhippes laden with great and moſt precious riches: and vnderſtanding that they were arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at the porte of <hi>Hoſtia,</hi> ſecreately he commaunded the mariners to ſincke them: whereof beeing reproued in the Senate, hee aunſwered: that thereby they had to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his ſmall couetouſnes, for that he ſpent the riches of the earth, and drowned that which came by Sea. <q>
                     <hi>Helioga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balus</hi>
was prodigall and curious, not onely openly, but alſo in ſecreate: for that his Vrinall was of <hi>Vnicorne,</hi> and his ſtoole of fine gold. When he chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced to iſſue out of <hi>Rome,</hi> he had w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him no leſſe then 600. wagons, which were al la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, not with cheſtes, apparel, either any thing neceſſarie or apperteyning vnto perſons of the Courte: but with wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ieaſters, muſicians, hunters, fiſhers, exquiſite wines, and victuals neuer heard off: for that he neuer went foorth of <hi>Rome</hi> to viſite countries, or conquere enimies, but to ſéeke delectable places, the more fréely to giue him ſelfe to vice.</q>
A certaine Senatour demaunding why hee vſed ſuch exceſſe in ſpending, he made him anſwere: My friend, I giue thée to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that none doth inherite but after the death of ſome perſon: and therefore I will in my life time, make my ſelf mine owne heire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="427" facs="tcp:3692:217"/>The armies did not a little repent them to haue elected him Emperour, and the Senate no leſſe to haue accepted and allowed the ſame: for that he was ſo wilfull in all thinges, that he was not onely ſatiſfied to be vitious in all humaine vices: but watched and ſtudied to inuent newe wickednes. <hi>Meſia</hi> the grandmother of <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che procured, or (to ſay better) bought him the Empire, had ſufficiently aduiſed and alſo perſuaded him to be good and vertuous: but hee was ſo obſtinate in his euill, and ſo vowed and dedicated vnto vice, that he litle eſtéemed the counſell of his friends, either the threatenings of his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>When his graundmother <hi>Meſia</hi> perceiued, that good perſuaſions would neither profite, either great threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings pearce him with any feare, ſhée remembred to fixe her eyes vppon her other nephue named <hi>Alexander,</hi> that the one being dead, the other might ſuccede: for ſhée helde it for moſt certeine, that in fewe dayes, reſpect being had of his many vices, his Empire ſhould finiſhe. As <hi>Meſia</hi> was auncient, prouident, and of experience: ſo ſhée per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> with ſuch wordes, that he accepted his couſin <hi>Alexander</hi> as companion of the Empire, which election the Senate approued and allowed with great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and no leſſe gratefull vnto the whole people: and from thence foorth, although they obeyed <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> yet they did yeald al their loue vnto his couſin <hi>Alexander. Heliogabalus</hi> being aduertiſed by certeine Nekroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike Prieſtes of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that he ſhould haue a death ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto his life (whereby, he doubted that his life ſhould be ſhort, and his death ſhamefull:) began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe with him ſelfe, what kinde of death might be giuen him by his enimies: and conſidered, that either they would cutt his throte, or hang him, or caſt him down fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome rocke, or drowne him, or end his dayes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſome poyſon: &amp; thus it was, he filled a ponde full of roſe water, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to be drowned: at the foote of a Tower of his houſe, he placed golden ſande, to fall on: he made twiſted

ſilke halters wherewith to be hanged: hée commaunded daggers and ſwordes of gold, wherewith to be ſlaine: and conſerued poyſon in Vnicorne boxes, wherewith to be poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned: all which he prouided of purpoſe, that at the time of néede he might one way or other end his wretched life: for (as he vſed to ſay) he greatly did not eſtéeme to die, if with ſuch, and ſo ſtately inſtruments he might be put to death. But the ſucceſſe happened quite contrarie to the forcaſtes of <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> as well in dying when he would not, as in the maner of his death, whereof he did not thincke: for it is a thing notorious vnto all men, that <hi>we may neither inlarge our life as we deſire, either ſhunne that death whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che we abhorre.</hi>

               <p>After that <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> found the great gard &amp; watch of the mother and grandmother ouer <hi>Alexander,</hi> he went on a day vnto the Senate, perſuading with ſwéete woords, and after commaunding vppon great paines, to take that name <hi>Caeſar</hi> from <hi>Alexander,</hi> which they had giuen him:
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:3692:218"/>
this demaunde being heard of the whole Senate, euery man caſte downe his head, and aunſwered not ſo much as one word. When he ſawe the Senate refuſe his requeſt, he did write a letter vnto the Prefects, and moſt principal of the armies, to giue them to vnderſtand that from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth they ſhould giue no honour vnto <hi>Alexander,</hi> much leſſe yéeld him ſeruice as vnto <hi>Caeſar</hi>: but the armies fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it rather to procéede of his ouermuch malice, then of any fault in <hi>Alexander,</hi> did not obey his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements, neither aunſwered his letters.</p>
               <p>When hee might not perſuade the Senatours, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine the armies, he aduiſed to bribe and corrupt his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts and houſehold officers, promiſing them many and great rewards, if they would temper his meate with ſome poyſon, to rid him of his life. He conferred alſo with the tutours of <hi>Alexander,</hi> to finde if he might frame them to lead him foorth in to ſome Orchard or gardeine, or to ſéeke ſome deuice to leaue him alone: vnto whome he did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſe great riches &amp; wealth, but alſo promotions to great offices. <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> perceiuing that hee mighte neither corrupt the one, or perſuade the other, for that hee was loued of al men, commaunded his counterfects open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ouerthrowen and defiled with dyrte: whiche was holden amongeſt the <hi>Romanes,</hi> as great an iniurie, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to take away a mans life.</p>
               <p>On that day in which <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> had commaunded the counterfects of <hi>Alexander</hi> to be defaced and defiled, he prepared alſo in ſecreate, certaine his friends to kill <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> if vpon the chaunce of any mutinie that might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, hee ſhould come forth: for he did beare him ſo mortall hatred, that it ſéemed his life to proſper to none effecte, if he might not ſpoile him of his life.

much that they did not onely repell that iniurie, but alſo purſued <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> vnto his garden to haue ſlaine him.

As much as <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> determined to haue ſlaine <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſo much were the armies purpoſed to haue killed <hi>Heliogabalus</hi>: and for the execution thereof, with great furie they marched to ſéeke him at his garden: vnto whom there came forth to talke, not himſelfe, but his grandmother, of whom ſhe obteyned at that time the ſafetie of his life: which they graunted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon condition, that hee ſhould correct his perſon, reforme his houſe, and viſite the common wealthes. On the nexte day, they caſte foorth and ridd the houſe of <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> of <hi>Gabalus, Herodes, Gordius,</hi> and <hi>Murius,</hi> which were his fauoured ſeruauntes, and companions of his vices: and thoſe in déede, that from a foole, conuerted him into an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diot.

               <p>And being as then very late at night, when the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours came from the Senate, they there preſently at the gates thereof, receiued commaundement from <hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabalus,</hi> that without all delay vppon paine of their liues, they ſhould depart out of the citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> without viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation either of houſe or friend: and as there were of them both ſicke and old, ſo it was lamentable to behold them wander in the darcke, ſtumbling in thoſe fieldes, and ſo

bitterly wéeping.
<q>The Conſuls and Senatours being ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, there remayned in <hi>Rome</hi> a certaine auncient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul named <hi>Sabinus,</hi> a man excellently learned, vnto whom <hi>Vlpianus</hi> did dedicate his bookes, and of whome the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> receiued counſell, in all their graue affaires.

                  <hi>Manea</hi> the mother of this prince, was a woman very wiſe, prudent, aduiſed, and no leſſe faire: and the ſpeciall cauſe why ſhee deſerued ſo greatly to be eſtéemed and honoured, was: becauſe no <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> woman did excéede her in honeſtie of perſon, either was equal vnto her in kéeping her houſe.

Matters of iuſtice were not handled, but of men very well learned: Martiall affaires were not commended, but vnto men of great experience:
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:3692:222"/>
cauſes of the common wealth were not manured, but of perſons ſkilfull therein: in ſuch wiſe, that they prouided, not offices for men, but men for offices.</p>
               <p>Alſo <hi>Alexander</hi> reformed the whole condition &amp; eſtate of his houſe, as well the miniſters, as the expences thereof: which all the dayes of <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> excéeded in diſorder, &amp; was no leſſe defiled with vice: for which cauſe he ſet a ſeaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the charges thereof, and elected faithful officers to ſpend the ſame: in ſuch wiſe, that in the houſe of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> there was neither immoderate expences, either men wanting offices.

vpon <hi>Manea,</hi> mother vnto <hi>Alexander</hi>: whome al men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to be in full poſſeſſion of chaſtitie, temperance, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and patience, but notwithſtanding ſomewhat incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to auarice: whereof procéeded, theſe words earely in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning to be written vppon the gates: if <hi>Manea</hi> had not charge of monie in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, ſuch a <hi>Romane</hi> had neuer béene borne in <hi>Rome.</hi> Long time paſſed in which the Senate had not béene viſited: which <hi>Alexander</hi> forgat not, as wel to viſite, as alſo to reforme: not only by inquiſition how they liued and gouerned the common wealth, but alſo how they ordered their houſes &amp; ruled their families: for he vſed oft to ſay, that <hi>the man which knewe not to gouerne his wife, to prouide for his houſe, and direct his familie, the prince might not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit a greater follie, then to place ſuch a one in the gouernment of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth.</hi> In <hi>Rome</hi> they were named <hi>Milites veterani,</hi> that long time had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in warres, and were withdrawen vnto their houſes: theſe were mainteyned at the charges of the common wealth, and priuileged for apparance before a Iudge: and as <hi>Alexander</hi> was infourmed of their licentious and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liues, he commaunded them to be baniſhed <hi>Rome,</hi> and no more to be mainteyned by the common wealth. When he ſigned the ſentence of their exile, with his owne hands, he added theſe words: <hi>It is as iuſt that the vicious and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a free man, be conuerted to a ſlaue: as the vertuous from a bond man, to be made free: for where there is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of manners, liberties haue no place:</hi> Moſt truely theſe wordes were ſpoken, as of a prince right worthie ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.

ſpent and imployed in matters profitable: for it was his opinion, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Good princes ought not to conſent, that vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds ſhould liue of the entrails of the people.</hi> He wrote vnto all prouinces, that in all ciuil cauſes, Iudges ſhould procéede according to the order and right therof, théeues &amp; matters of felonie excepted: who within thrée dayes after their apprehenſion, ſhould either be puniſhed, executed, made ſlaues for the ſeruice of men, or condemned to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon works for publique profite, and for no cauſe to let them eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape: for as he oft ſaid, <hi>Neuer ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which had made a proofe in the knowledge of thefte, vntill his death, might at any time depart from ſo foule a vice.</hi> He alſo viſited the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
that had the charge of pay for the men of warre: <q>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whome he receiued accuſations for payment of euil monie, imbezeling of payes, reckoning the dead with the liuing, and valuing their victuals more then they were woorthe: whome <hi>Alexander</hi> commaunded open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be whipt, and for euermore to be baniſhed.

All thinges which he had to commaunde, or prouide in the common wealth, hée did firſt communicate with ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as hee thought to haue knowledge and experience thereof: and his manner was to ſay, that in following his owne proper iudgment, he had neuer but tedious ſucceſſe: but by repayring vnto other mens aduiſe, hee alwayes gathered ſome fruite.</p>
               <p>Hée held in his houſe many, and very notable perſons, of whome alwayes hée was accompanied: but amongeſt al whome he beſt loued, and did moſt commend his ſecréetes, was <hi>Vlpianus</hi>: this <hi>Vlpianus,</hi> beſides his great learning, was a man ſo vertuous, that <hi>Alexander</hi> would oft ſay, hée had rather aduenture the committing of ſome odious déede before the Gods, then ſpeake a foule woorde in preſence of <hi>Vlpianus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His predeceſſour <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> had ordeyned many

lawes in the fauour of the fiſcall, to the greate preiudice of the people: for, admitting that goods were augmented: yet on the other parte, the common wealth daily dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: for which cauſe <hi>Alexander</hi> commaunded, that all thoſe lawes ſhould be reuiewed, conſidered, and refour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: for, as he vſed to ſaye, <hi>it were more commodious for the Prince which is no tyrant, that his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth be riche, and his houſe poore: then the common wealth to be poore, and his houſe riche.</hi> When he beganne to reigne, the people were abandoned to diſſolute manners: for which cauſe he made ſome rigorous lawes, and other milde and pittifull: but, when he commaunded them to be proclaimed openly, he gaue aduertiſement vnto his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, to execute them in ſecrete. <hi>Conſider not ſo much what I commaund you, as the intent wherewith I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund you, which is to weete, that rigorous lawes are not, but to terrifie: but lawes which are pitifull, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, becauſe we make not lawes, to take away mennes liues, but to roote and weede vices out of our common wealthes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Senatours did ſitt in graue affaires, he was not contented that they ſhould ſaye their opinions by woorde, but by writing: neither was he yet ſatiſfyed that they ſhould ſet it down in writing, but adde alſo therunto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reaſons which moued them to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their opinion: ſaying, he did it to this ende, that none ſhould aduenture to yeld his opinion, either forced with affection, or corrupted with paſſion: but as reaſon and vertue ſhould direct him.
<q>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, he was an enimie vnto lyes and lyers: and if any man preſumed to lye in his preſence, he receiued thereof as great deſpight, as though he had done him an iniurie. He woulde oft ſaye, that good Princes haue to eſteeme ſuch for greater enimies, that deceiue them with flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and lyes, then ſuch as do intrude vppon their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: for the one taketh not but of his goods, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther robbeth him of his fame. At all times, when they had talk of the election of any Senatour or Iudge, he was

alwayes hearde to ſpeake theſe woordes in the Senate: <hi>If, as nowe being preſent with men, <hi>I</hi> were in preſence of the Gods, I would craue their opinions in the electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Senatours and Iudges: for that the choice of gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in a common wealth, doth more ſeeme diuine, then humaine election.</hi>

Hee vſed vnto no kinde of people ſo great liberalitie, as vnto Iudges, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes, and Pretors, which had charge, and were ſincere in miniſtring Iuſtice: and aduouched vnto the Senate, that a Prince with reaſon ought not to bee intituled a Prince, vnleſſe he were carefull for the execution of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: and if he finde any that is iuſt in the adminiſtration thereof, ſuch a one iuſtly may not be recompenced: for which cauſe, I giue them more then any other perſons which ſerue me, that by their enrichement, all occaſions to make other men poore, from them may be remoued.

                  <hi>Alexander</hi> had a ſeruaunt named <hi>Belon,</hi> who promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a gentleman to diſpatch a certeine matter of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance with <hi>Alexander,</hi> that touched him not a little, giuing to vnderſtande, that he was verie priuate with the Prince: and in remuneration of his promiſed trauell, hee receiued of that gentleman a greate ſumme of money: whereof <hi>Alexander</hi> being aduertiſed, and that which hee promiſed to obteine, to be a matter moſt vniuſt, &amp; no ſmal offence vnto the common wealth, he commaunded him to be crucified: affirming, that none ſhould dare to aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſell the fauour of the Prince, to the preiudice of the common people. He would many times aſſemble the chiefeſt of the people, and warne them to be vertuous, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble minded, and pitifull vnto the common ſorte: aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, that aſſuredly he would deale with the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as with ſonnes, and with the wicked, as with eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>Thrée times hee gaue vnto the <hi>Romane</hi> people, greate quantities of wheate, in time of greate dearth. Alſo, at other times he gaue, of his grace, vnto the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient horſemen, great ſummes of money: vnderſtandinge the greateſt parte of them to be in debt. There were in <hi>Rome</hi> many perſones that liued not, but by vſurie, by which meane much goods were loſt, and many houſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come tributarie: wherein <hi>Alexander</hi> commaunded excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding diligence to be vſed in the reuiewe of ſuch contracts, and a memoriall of the moſte notable griefes to be giuen him: which when he had conſidered, he puniſhed the vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and gaue libertie vnto the poore men that were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
               <p>The manner of his diſpatche in affaires, was, to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in hearing, mylde in anſwering, ſkilfull in concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and pittifull in denying: in ſuch wiſe, that if he gaue not that which they demaunded, at the leaſt he gaue them comfort with his woordes. After he came from the
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:3692:227"/>
Senate, and had diſpatched the affaires of ſuters, he did alwayes paſſe the time in reading Gréeke rather then La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine: amongeſt all other thinges which he vſed to reade, was <hi>Plato</hi> his comon wealth, <hi>Cicero</hi> his offices, <hi>Horace,</hi> and <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> with the life of <hi>Alexander</hi>: whom (his vices excepted) he diligently did imitate. If he ſawe any of his officers, that for age, or impotencie, might not ſerue: he did either call him or viſite him, giuing him many thankes for the ſeruice which he had done him: and would requeſt him to take it in good parte, to receiue his whole ſtipend, with eaſe and reſt in his owne houſe: and to place ſome other in that office, méete for his ſeruice. Vſually he did eate twiſe a daye, and in his féeding more cleanly and curious, then coſtly and ſumptuous: and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was offended with his officers, for the lacke of many, or exquiſite meates: but for want of cleanlineſſe, and good ſeaſoning.</p>
               <p>Many perſons wandring in <hi>Rome,</hi> and vagarant throughout all <hi>Italie,</hi> yole as caſtawayes, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining to learne ſome occupation after they were ſo char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by commaundement: hee gaue licence vnto all men, without further authoritie, to take them for their ſlaues: which if they renounced, then fréely to kill them. He did permitt none of his ſeruauntes to weare any ſilke, clothe of golde, or ſiluer: for that he oft vſed to ſaye, that <hi>open exceſſe of apparel, and ſecrete vice, were the deſtruction of Courtiers.</hi> Alſo he often aduouched, <hi>the condition of a good Prince was, more to be recreated with hearing wiſe men talke, then in taſting delicate meates. Alexander</hi> had
in his houſe a certeine perſon named <hi>Veturius Turinus,</hi> whome he loued: <q>againſt him going and comming to his chamber, no dore was ſhutt: this fellowe was both guylefull and lying, and made all men, that were ſuters vnto <hi>Alexander,</hi> beléeue that he had more conference with him, then with any perſon of the Empire.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>The caſe was thus, that <hi>Alexander</hi> being aduertiſed of his vanitie and lewdneſſe, and howe he deceiued, and

was bribed of many, cauſed a Foſter to requeſt <hi>Turinus</hi> to diſpatche a certeine ſuite with <hi>Alexander</hi>: who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and going daily into the Princes chamber, alwayes aduertiſed the ſuter: thus, and ſo I haue ſaide in thy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and thus and ſo was I aunſwered of <hi>Alexander</hi>: the good Prince had true intelligence what <hi>Turinus</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſaye, and of the bribes which he had receiued: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon preſently he prouided that <hi>Turinus</hi> was taken, and in his preſence by witneſſe conuinced of the guyle and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite which he had committed, of his huge promiſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and howe muche he had robbed: which inquiſition ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly made, he commaunded him to be fixed aloft vppon a ſtake openly in <hi>Rome,</hi> and vnder him was ſet gréene woode and wette ſtrawe, which being ſet on fire, did yelde vnto his noſe a moſte cruell ſmoke, which was not ſo little, but that in ſhorte ſpace it deliuered the miſerable caytife of his life: a cryer with a loude voice makinge proclamation, <hi>Fumo punitur qui fumum vendidit</hi>: which is to ſaye: <hi>He that ſolde ſmoke, is ſmooldered in ſmoke.</hi> In all famous cities, he cauſed ſtorehouſes to be made, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeruing for ſafe kéeping of the goodes and riches of ſuch neighbours as doubted robbing.</q>

               <p>He made in <hi>Rome</hi> newe principall ſtréetes, wherein he buylt ſtately and delightſome houſes, which he gaue in rewarde vnto his friendes and ſeruauntes that were wiſe and vertuous.</p>
               <p>Garmentes of pure ſilcke he was neuer knowen, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to buy or weare: and if by chaunce any were giuen or preſented vnto him, he beſtowed them vpon the prieſts of the Temples, to be apparelled when they ſhoulde offer ſacrifices.

               <p>ALl the dayes of his Empire, he enterteined but one Phyſician, vnto whom, or any other, he did not at any time yelde his pulſe, either of any Phyſician tooke coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: and to him would oft ſaye in ieſt, thinke not that I giue thée to eate, to cure mée: but to the ende thou ſhalt not cure mée. He neither delighted in Phyſicke, or that Phyſicians ſhould remaine in <hi>Rome</hi>: and for defence of his opinion he vſed to ſaye, that <hi>as greate infirmities doe not happen but by great exceſſe: ſo it argueth that the Prince which is compaſſed with Phyſicians, goeth char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with many vices.</hi> Preſidents of prouinces, when he ſent them to be reſident in their circuites, he did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtruct what they ought to doe, but alſo prouided them for all neceſſities: and at their returne, if they had done well, he relieued their neceſſities with his great libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: but if they had done euil, he diſtreſſed them both of goods and fame. Pretors, Cenſors, and preſidentes that had charge of iuſtice, if they had no wiues, he compelled to take concubines into their houſes, to the ende they
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:3692:228"/>
ſhould not followe other mennes wiues: for he helde opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that it were not agréeable vnto Iuſtice, or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the honour of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Iudges for adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſhould be accuſed of adulterie. Vnto <hi>CHRIST</hi> he would haue made a temple in <hi>Rome,</hi> and placed him in the number of their Gods, which alſo was ſaid of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Adrian</hi>: but the prieſtes of the temples diſuaded him, ſaying: that they had receiued aunſwer of the oracle that if he ſhould perfourme that acte, all other temples ſhould periſhe, and all perſons would conuert themſelues and become <hi>Chriſtians. Alexander</hi> in Ieſtes, was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: in fables, inuentiue: in bankets, a companion: in gathering of golde, ſkilfull: in conſeruing, aduiſed: in ſearching of mines, diligent: in giuing, liberall: and in ſpeculation of newe deuices, exceeding carefull. In ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt or in ieſt, in worde or in writing, he would not be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but <hi>Romane</hi>: for which purpoſe, he made ſundry di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent ſearches of his genealogie, wherby he gaue demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his deſcent from the <hi>Fabioes Metelloes,</hi> which were noble and auncient <hi>Romanes.</hi>
                  <q>Hee brought vnto <hi>Rome</hi> great learned men, to reade all Sciences: to which effect he erected many colledges and ſtudies, and indued them with greate rents, where the ſonnes onely of poore men were receiued and taught. Gouernours of Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he puniſhed moſte grieuouſly, for their offence in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: eſpecially, if they were noted, or rather accuſed, of bryberie: but if by malice they were wrongfully accuſed, the accuſer receiued the chaſticement of the accuſed.

againſt whome he vſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme iuſtice: and reſpecting the offence to redound, not ſo much vnto him ſelfe, as vnto others, he affirmed: that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince ought not to giue them pardon. Hee had alwayes in his chamber a booke wherein were written all notable ſeruices which had béene done vnto him: he alſo entred into the ſame, all greate rewardes that he had giuen: and if any man happened to do him ſome notable ſeruice, and
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:3692:229"/>
craued no recompence in conſideration thereof: <q>he woulde
call him and ſaye theſe, or ſuch like wordes: What is the matter that thou demaundeſt nothing of mée? perchaunce thou wouldeſt haue mée thy debtour for thy ſeruice, ſince thou ſéekeſt not the recompence of thy trauell.

And if thou ceaſeſt to craue, in thinking mée to be in neceſſitie, and not able to accompliſh with all perſons, moſte vaine is thy iudgement: for that the Prince, hauing no other meane to paye, is ſo muche bound to recompence ſeruice, that he hath to redéeme it, euen from his ordinarie diet. Conformable vnto thine eſtate, demaunde what thou wilt: for ſince thou beeing a ſeruaunt, hadſt a minde to ſerue: it is iuſt, that I beeing a Prince, ſhoulde haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes to giue thée.</q>

                              <pb n="455" facs="tcp:3692:231"/>I haue read this letter of your Prince, more then once or twice: and as appeareth by the ſtyle thereof, he hath ſpent more time in the Achademies, ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: then in the fieldes, fighting: becauſe warrelike Princes haue high thoughtes, and reaſons very ſhort: but in armes verie doughtie.</p>
                           <p>I accept your Ambaſſage, and explicate your cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, ſince the meaning of your Prince is, that I ſhall leaue what I haue taken from the Parthians, and not occupie my ſelfe in poſſeſsing that which appertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto the Romanes: vnto this aunſweringe, I ſaye: that the lawe which hath ordeined, this is thine, and this is mine, proceeded from baſe mindes and humble heartes, that wanted hardineſſe to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe greate thinges: immagining to defende by boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, that which they durſt not winne with armes. The lawes made by poore Philoſophers ought not to preiudice the greateneſſe of Princes: becauſe the Goddes haue determined, that all thinges ſhall bee proper, except kingdomes, which amongeſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhould be common: the right whereof conſiſteth not in ſuch as doe inherite them, but in them which may winne them.</p>

but enuieth anothers kingdome: I am determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to conſerue that which I haue taken from the Parthians, and to take what I may from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes: and if fortune ſhalbee frowarde in this my iourney, at the leaſt all men ſhall prayſe the greatnes of my minde.</p>

                           <p>Brethren, companions, and my friends, I beſeeche the immortall Gods, to giue vnto my tongue ſweete eloquence, touching that which I haue to ſay: and to place in your hartes congruent attention, concerning that which you haue to heare: becauſe, grace to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade in him that ſpeaketh, and permiſſion to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded in him that heareth, are gifts that many craue, but verie few obteine. The inclination wherwith we are ledd, is ſo proud, and the malice of man ſo wilie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is none which eſteemeth himſelfe ſo ſimple, but thinketh to know that which another vnderſtandeth: and therefore, for one man to haue ſkill to perſuade many, is a gift that the gods onely do giue. With the ſeueritie of Demoſthenes, the prudence of Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, the wiſedome of Plato, and the eloquence of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero, many may hardly perſuade one perſon: &amp; doth one man thincke to perſuade many? That which I haue preſently to ſay vnto you, is not to the ende that ye ſhal do what I wil, but to vnderſtand what it is that you will: becauſe, in great and graue affaires, one hath to propound, but many to determine. But comming to the purpoſe: you haue knowen &amp; ſeene, that theſe xi. yeares we haue gouerned the Romane Empire: in which ſpace we haue trauelled to conſerue all men in iuſtice, &amp; ſhunned all occaſions that might hinder our peace: wherin we haue cauſe to giue thanks vnto the Gods, ſince we haue deſerued to enioy in oure time, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which our predeceſſours neuer obteined. Although a
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:3692:233"/>
prince in his condition be a Saturnine, and in his life not well aduiſed, in conuerſation vnbridled, in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping couetous, and proud in his owne eſtimation: yet all is to bee ſuffered and diſſimuled, if hee hold peace with ſtrangers, and without acception of perſons, doe equall iuſtice vnto his ſubiectes. It is knowen vnto you all, that Artaxerxes king of Perſians, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Parthians, and dealt foulely with all oure confederats &amp; friendes, and yet remayneth in ſo great power in Aſia, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is not againſt him one launce in the Reſte: but your heroycall deedes and noble mindes being conſidered, wee thincke not that ye ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meruaile, or haue any doubt thereof: for that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration proceedeth of ſmall wiſedome, and feare of cowardneſſe. Heroycall perſons, that amongeſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would be notified, receiue with equall mindes aduerſitie and proſperitie: for vnto ſuch men, though the ioy of proſperitie, and the ſmarte of aduerſitie bee vncertaine, yet is their glorie vnuariable. Leauing the Gods, and ſpeaking of the affaires of men, nothing may iuſtly bee termed great, but that which bringeth with it great inconuenience: and then one is of more valure then all, when one doeth that whiche all lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue vndone: for, greatneſſe conſiſteth not in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing proud deſires: but in perfourming deedes of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe.</p>
                           <p>From Rome wee haue ſent oure Embaſſadours vnto Artaxerxes, to perſuade him to leaue thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces whiche hee hath taken, and to abſtaine from them which hee ment to take: which hee not onely refuſeth to doe, but hardly might endure the hearing therof: for which cauſe, it apperteineth vnto the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Rome, to employ it ſelfe to the breaking
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:3692:234"/>
of his pride: for that it proceeded not of leſſe vertue to humble the proud, then to aduaunce the humble. Many of you which be here, haue beene bred, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo preſent at the glorious acts of Antoninus Pius, and Seuerus my progenitours, noble men of immortall renowne: and notwithſtanding that by the antiquitie of your yeares, and the trauels which ye haue paſſed in the warres, ye may not fight, yet at the leaſt ye ſhal profite vs by your aduiſe and counſell: whiche in the warres is verie neceſſarie, and no leſſe profitable: for that in ſuch aſſembly, one counſell is oft giuen, that exceedeth the ſeruice of a thouſand horſemen. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly wee ought to hope, that wee Romanes ſhal bee conquerours, and the Barbarians ouerthrowen: not onely for that they firſt raiſed this warre, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we haue requeſted them with peace: wherein y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gods are ſo iuſt, that very ſildome they permit them to enioy the victorie, who were the occaſion to raiſe that warre. And doubt ye neuer the more, for that our armour is old &amp; ruſtie: becauſe the felicitie of warre, conſiſteth not in bright armour, but in doughtie harts and noble mindes. Many which march on land in bright armour, be ouercome: and all men that go by ſea, weare ruſtie armour, and doe conquere: in ſuch wiſe, that warre is not mainteyned with armour of y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, but with heartes of ſteele. And be not eſca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dalized with conſideration that ye haue to fight vnder the ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of a young prince, which wanteth experience in the warres: but as of the reſt, ſo of this ye ſhal haue no cauſe to doubt: for that I go determined, intending in the acte of fighting, to fight as one of you: &amp; in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of counſell, to yeeld my ſelfe vnto the counſel of the auncient.</p>

On the day in which he iſſued out of <hi>Rome,</hi> all the Senate and people did accompanie him 3. miles: &amp; further alſo (a thing much to be noted) there was none which beheld him departing, but bitterly fell a wée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping: for that being (as he was) a prince ſo pitiful, of all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was cordially and hartily beloued.

The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt griefe that did cruciate and torment his heart, was, to thinke that at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houre in which the fame of his vnfortunat fight ſhould be diuulgate and noyſed through the Empire, and the <hi>Germaines</hi> newly reuolted, his enimies in <hi>Rome</hi> would attempt ſome commotion in the common wealthe: for that <hi>it is naturall vnto the common people, to deſire daily chaunge of newe Lords.</hi> The Emperour <hi>Alexander</hi> determined in his owne perſon to be in the warrs of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie</hi>: and on the other part, did write to the Senate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous letters, ſending vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> to be offered in the temples, great ſacrifices: and ſhippes loaden with wheate and oyle, to be diuided amongeſt the people: and ioyntly with this, he ſecreately prouided to furniſhe the frontiars with men and victuals: in ſuch wiſe, that this good prince, in his owne perſon would goe to the warres againſt his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies: and with his goods would winne the heartes of his ſubiects. With no ſmall diligence, <hi>Alexander</hi> traueiled from <hi>Aſia</hi> to <hi>Germanie</hi>: and immediately vppon his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall at <hi>Rhene,</hi> he made bridges of boates, whereon his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies might fréely paſſe, and alſo fight with his enimies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> iourneying towards <hi>Germanie,</hi> enterteyned certaine people called <hi>Maures,</hi> which liued in the fieldes <hi>Oſſroanos,</hi> bordering vppon <hi>Thracia</hi>: who fought with long lances, hauing a head of yron at eche ende, with ſuch dexteritie and readineſſe on horſeback, that in riding they would take vp their lances falne vnto the ground: and alſo wound their enimies as well in flight, as aſſault. Many of theſe <hi>Maures</hi> were meruailous readie archers at the croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowe: and as naturally the <hi>Germaines</hi> are high of bodie,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:3692:236"/>
and ſlow and laden with fleſh, and the <hi>Maures</hi> on the other part, very ſkilful in ſhooting, and of like life in ſkirmiſhing: ſo they behaued themſelues no more nor no leſſe with the <hi>Germaines,</hi> then an archer with a white at a Butt, that is to ſay, without all danger to ſtrike the ſame all to péeces. Although the <hi>Romaines</hi> were few, yet in their martial af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres they had proſperous beginning, and no leſſe hope of good ſucceſſe: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Germaines,</hi> admitting they were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yet fought they with great miſfortune: becauſe the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> were men of experience, but the <hi>Germaines</hi> chiefly practiſed manuring the fields. Notwithſtanding the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines</hi> did repent them of their warlike attempts, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> not miſliking his perſonall iourney: yet the good prince forgat not to requeſt them, and alſo pray them with peace: for which purpoſe, he ſent vnto them wiſe Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, that on his behalfe ſhould ſay vnto them very good woords, and offer large rewards, with a general pardon of all iniuries: this did hée, not for feare, but yet with ſome doubt of fortunes variableneſſe, which in warlike atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pts diſcouereth her dealing with moſt vncertaintie. The <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines</hi> moſt times beginne their warres with choler, and proſecute the ſame with furie: but in the end, they endure to be perſuaded by requeſts, &amp; to be ouercome with monie. During the time that the Embaſſadours practiſed peace, they eſtabliſhed a truce betwixt both armies, whereat the <hi>Romane</hi> hoſtes were amazed, and no leſſe eſcandalized: for that as then being fleſhed vpon the <hi>Germaines,</hi> they would reuenge all iniuries, and alſo rob them of their goods.</p>

The generous and valiant gentlemen that <hi>Alexander</hi> had with him, hee did requeſt and perſuade to reſiſt the traitour <hi>Maximius,</hi> and as good vaſſals &amp; frends, in this caſe to liue and die with him: which they all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, but afterwards obſerued not.</q>

               <p>WHen <hi>Alexander</hi> departed from <hi>Rome</hi> to goe into the warres of <hi>Aſia,</hi> hée had great regard vnto his men of warre, as well for their ſafetie, as alſo for robbing ſuch countries as they were to paſſe: for, <hi>as naturall is it for men of warre to rob their neighbours, as to kill enimies.</hi> When hée did eate, he had alwayes his tente open: to the end all men of his hoſt ſhould both ſée and knowe, that the meate which he did eate, had more taſte of the ſharpneſſe of the warres, then of the delicateneſſe of <hi>Rome.</hi> Nightly hee did viſite the circuite of his campe: and at all times would giue them falſe alarmes, to yéeld them aptneſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to armour, and readineſſe to repaire vnto their enſignes. If any perſon did wander from his ſtandard, either to rob, or but ſo much as to walke, the qualitie of the perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, hee receiued puniſhment more or leſſe.</p>
               <p>If any were a brabler with his hoſte, froward with his
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:3692:238"/>
companions, diſobedient vnto his officers, tooke any thing by violence, or was foule mouthed, hee would ſay theſe woords vnto him: <q>
                     <hi>wouldeſt thou, that as thou doeſt, they ſhould doe, or as thou ſayeſt, they ſhould ſay vnto thee? Knoweſt thou not the prouerbe of the Chriſtians, <hi>Quod tibi no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vis, alteri ne feceris,</hi> that is, what thou wilt not to thy ſelfe, do not to another. Alexander</hi> ſaid that he heard this Prouerbe ſpoken, and he wiſt not whether of the Iewes or Chriſtians: whiche in his heart tooke ſuch déepe impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he did not onely ſpeake and repeate, but alſo many times wrote the ſame vnto his gouernours: and further, cauſed them to be drawen vppon his enſignes, and grauen vpon all his workes. <hi>Alexander</hi> being reſident in the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of <hi>Antioche,</hi> was informed that a certaine Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine had abuſed an auncient woman, both in woord and déede: and both being called into his preſence, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heard, he commaunded the Capitaine to be depriued of his roome and office, and of the liberties which hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in <hi>Rome</hi>: and further, that hee ſhould be ſlaue vnto the old woman: furthermore, hee commaunded that in Carpentars craft he ſhould perfourme his ſeruice, &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine his old dame.</q>
Hee vſed ſo great ſeueritie and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with his men of warre, that many times hee diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched them by whole bandes: for that he might not endure their ciuil diſſentions: or robberies, and ſcandals amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt neighbours.</p>
               <p>All <hi>Romane</hi> princes had feare of their armies, except <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the cauſe why (as he ſaid) hee feared them not, was: for that he payed them very well, and remoued all occaſion of reprehenſion from his owne perſon and life: for in the ende, <hi>none hath true libertie to chaſtice, but the man that is of a ſincere life.</hi> The armie remayning in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioche,</hi> he was aduertiſed that they gaue themſelues vnto women, haunted hoate houſes, and ſpente and loſt much time in vaine playes and idleneſſe: whereuppon hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded all the Capitaines, Tribunes, and Centurions, to be taken, and with yrons to be caſt into priſon, vppon

which cauſe there grew amongeſt them, no ſmall ſcandal: in ſo much that openly they durſt ſay vnto <hi>Alexander,</hi> if on that preſent day hee did not let them loſe, the nexte day following they would depart vnto the enimies. <hi>Alexander</hi> being aduertiſed what his men of warre had ſaid, &amp; what they ment to do, commaunded them all to appeare before his preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, both ſuch as were in bonds, as thoſe that were at libertie: ſaying vnto them theſe words.</p>

                           <p>Brothers, friends, and my companions, that which now I haue to ſay vnto you, is more for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che I beare you, then feare which I haue of you: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, princes that haue feare to execute iuſtice, either it is for that they are vniuſt: or becauſe their ſubiectes ſhould diſſemble their owne proper vices. Howe would ye that I ſhould ſuffer you, being (as ye are) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Romaines? whom cruell tyrantes would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure as their ſubiectes? There is none ſo euil, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe hee endeuour not to be vertuous, that of the good holdeth not good opinion: wherof followeth, that it is much more euill for the common wealthe, the prince being vertuous, to ſuffer perſons vicious: then him that is vicious, to permit no vice in his com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon wealth.</p>
                           <p>The prince that conſenteth vnto vices, and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth with vicious perſons, is not to be named a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full father, but a peruerſſe and a cruell tyraunte:
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:3692:239"/>
for that, notwithſtanding at the preſent hee doeth not chaſtice them, yet in proceſſe the one ſhall deſtroy the other. One vicious, with another that is vicious, may neuer long continue in friendſhip: for preſently vpon the decay of vice, at the inſtant their friendſhip faileth. Being (as I am) your prince according to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and your brother in loue, how would ye that I ſhould ſuffer you to rauiſh women, play your wages away at dice, ſpoile orchardes, with other ſuch like vile &amp; heynous deeds? Admitting that now I would paſſe and diſſemble the ſame, yet doubtleſſe, your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues before others would blame &amp; condemne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame: becauſe this tribute the good haue ouer the euill, that if they bee greeued with the chaſtiſement giuen vnto the euill, in the end they ſhall ſome day praiſe him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> did iuſtice. Vnderſtand ye not that ye are gentlemen of Rome? and that on the day in which any man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the name of a Romane, hee bindeth himſelfe to bee vertuous? Becauſe this name of Romanes, was not ſo much magnified of our predeceſſours, by kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling enimies in Aſia, as by weeding vices out of oure common wealthes.</p>
                           <p>Wee call the Perſians, Barbarians, becauſe they haue taken that which was ours: and doubt ye that of Romanes, they ſhall not intitle vs tyrantes, that haue ſpoyled others? I am named Alexander, and would imitate Alexander the great: of whome, and of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther king Philip it is ſaid, that when they brought foorth their armies to fighte, they ſeemed more a Senate in the common wealth, then men of warre. If they had done what ye nowe haue done, neuer might thoſe princes haue obteined ſo great victories of their enimies, either writers ſo largely to haue regiſtred
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:3692:239"/>
their noble and glorious deedes, either might I haue prayſed them with ſo good wordes: whereof folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the chiefeſt effecte to ouerthrowe enimies, is, to holde armies verie well diſciplined. Princes vſe to loſe manie victories, not for want of iuſtified war, but becauſe their men of warre are wicked: and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittinge that ſome times euill men do conquere, yet in the end they ſhal be vanquiſhed, or elſe of the gods cruelly chaſticed. Let them be certeine, that are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſent or abſent, if anie one will be euill, either let him returne vnto his houſe, or elſe we ſhal chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten him if he remaine vnder our ſtandard: becauſe it is not iuſte that wee, comminge to recouer that whiche is vſurped from the common wealth, by bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe with your woorkes, ſhoulde defame our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rome. If we ſuffer ſo manie trauels, aduenture our ſelues in ſo manie perills, and conſume our trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, it is not for wante of oyle, wheate, wine, plate, or golde, but to magnifie the renowme of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Empire: and ſince it is ſo, howe is it poſſible for the Gods to permitt, that by the handes of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous perſons, we ſhould obteine honour or renoune. Numa Pompilius, Quintus Cincinnatus, Marcus Marcellus, Paulus Emilius, Quintus Fabius, Cneus Fabricius, and Scipio Africanus brought to paſſe, with the Gods that the Romaine empire was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that through the worlde the name of Rome was reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced: we read not in hiſtories that theſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and noble men, in their perſons were tyrants, and muche leſſe woulde conſente their armies to be vicious. Beleeue me, friends and companions, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that will mainteine the fame of good Princes, and not recouer the reproche of tyrantes, ought to haue
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:3692:240"/>
as greate care to preſerue their armies from vice, as to auoyde the treaſon of enimies: for that men do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre greater daunger by ſecrete vices, then by open enimies. That whiche ye haue done, is either good or euill: and if robbinge of fieldes, rayſinge of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinies, and forceing of women, be good: then by this accompt, to honour temples, defende orphans, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vnto the Gods, and to vſe iuſtice with all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is wicked: ſince the lawes whiche condemne the one, allowe the other: whiche of all you is neither to be beleued, either ſo muche as once to be thought: for, not withſtandinge of euill we can ſay but euil: yet is it muche worſe to defende, then do it. If theſe inſolencies whiche I haue rehearſed, and you haue committed, ye holde for euill: why conceiue ye not the chaſticemente giuen for the ſame, to be good? If vertue and rewarde be couſines, who wil denie that the treſpaſſe &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> puniſhment are brethren? He that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned the conquerour to triumph, hath he not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the theefe to be hanged? Will ye be paide before hande, for ſeruice vnperfourmed? and will ye neither pay or reſtore that whiche ye haue pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyned?</p>
                           <p>Notwithſtanding Princes haue greate libertie in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, yet are they not exempted or free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iuſtice: and will men of warre only be priuileged? The wordes whiche ye haue vttered, and the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges which ye haue thundered, neither do I take them as iniuries, or yeald my ſelf to anie grieuous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonie: for in killinge me, ye ſhall kill but one: yet in the ende, there ſhall not wante in the Empire, one to ſucceede mee, and alſo to chaſtice you.</p>
                           <p>That whiche I preſently requeſte and commaund
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:3692:240"/>
you, is, to amende that whiche is paſt, preſentely to imbrace quietneſſe, and to be aduiſed in time to come: whiche if ye refuſe, I ſhall be forced to vſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, becauſe I am not to ſupporte mine Empire, by relieuing vicious ſouldiours, but in maintenance of all men by iuſtice.</p>

What fame, or glorie, what eaſe or quietneſſe, doth followe the life of that Prince which dieth in his olde yeres, and ſickely? in which age, for the moſt parte, olde men be euil ſerued of their ſubiectes, and contemned of ſtraungers.

                              <p>Thraſibulus, thou doeſt well knowe, that Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, Darius, Hector, Pompeyus, Gayus, Tulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Seneca, and Demoſthenes, were men in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons verie glorious, in doctrines verie wiſe, and in their deedes no leſſe heroycall: and yet all theſe with many others dyed, not acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with their friends, but by the handes of their enimies: neither were they blemiſhed with ſo vntimely a death, ſince of them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was leſſe eſteemed: but rather by their cruell deaths, they aduaunced their fames.
