         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And where as in the prologue of the ſayd boke I demaunded and aſked a queſtyon / and that was this. Whervnto is euery man ordayned as playnely it dothe appere in the prologue of the ſame In lyke maner in the prologue of this treatiſe / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che I entende by the ſuffrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and helpe of our lorde Ieſu / to contryue / compyle / and make to the profyte of all noble men and women bothe ſpyrituall &amp; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall / I demaunde another queſtyon / and that is this. Howe &amp; by what maner / do all theſe great eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and noblemen and women lyue and maynteyne
<pb facs="tcp:12548:6"/>
their honour and degre? and in myne opinyon / their honour and degre is vpholden and maynteyned / by reaſon of their rentes / iſſues / reuenewes / and profy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes that come of their maners / lordſhippes / landes &amp; tenementes to them belongyng. Than it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye to be knowen / howe all theſe maners / lordſhips / landes / &amp; tenementꝭ ſhulde be exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded / ſurueyed / but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted / bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded / and valued in euery parte: that the ſaid eſtates ſhulde nat be diſceyued / defrauded / nor diſhe ryted of their poſſeſſyons / rentes / cuſtomes / and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyces / the whiche they haue to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reſerued / for mayn teynaunce of their eſtates and degrees.

And the Surueyour to leaue the ſayd boke made by hym with his lorde in maner of a regyſter / whervnto the ſame Surueyour or another offycer / maye alway haue reſort / whan nede ſhall requyre to loke vpon. And that boke ſo truely made / maye be a regyſter and ſure euydence: that the lorde / his frehol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ders / copye holders / nor tenauntes / ſhall neuer loſe landes nor rentes / cuſtomes / nor ſeruyces: but euery man that redeth the boke / ſhall ꝑfitely knowe where the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des lye / whoſe it was at the day of the makyng of the ſayd boke / and whoſe it is.

But of one thyng I pronounce and declare / and take god to my recorde: that I make this boke all onely / to thentent that the lordes / the freholders nor their heyres <abbr>ſhuld</abbr>
nat be diſheryt / nor haue their landes loſt nor imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelde nor encroched by one from another / and to non other entent. And for that I aduertyſe and exorte on goddes behalfe / all maner of perſons as well lordes as other. That whan the lordꝭ or freholders / knowe where their landes lye and what euery paſture or ꝑ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell is worthe by the yere. That the lordes nor the ow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ners therof do nat heyghten their rentes of their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauntes
<pb facs="tcp:12548:7"/>
/ or to cauſe them to pay more rent or a gret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fyne / than they haue ben acuſtomed to do in tyme paſt. For as me ſemeth / a gretter charyte nor almes dede a man may nat well do / than vpon his owne te<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nauntes. And alſo to the contrarie / a gretter bribery nor extorcyon a man can nat do / than vpon his owne tenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes / for they dare nat ſay nay nor yet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>playne / and therfore on their ſoules go it that ſo do and nat on myne. Paraue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture the lorde wyll ſay it is nat his dede it was his Surueyours / but that can nat be ſo for ſaynt Auguſtyne ſaythe. Qui ꝑ alium facit per ſeipſum facere videtur. That is to ſay: he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth another man to do a thyng he dothe it hym ſelfe. And there be two princypals in one acte doyng and alſo he ſaythe. Conſenſcientes et age<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes pari pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na puniantur. That is to ſay / the conſentours and the doers ſhall be lyke punyſſhed. at grammer ſcole I lerned a vers and that is this. Dum poteris quid vis poſſis cognoſcere quid ſis. That is to ſay / whan thou mayſt do what thou wylte / thou mayſt knowe what thou arte. that is to wytte / good or yuell. But for a grounde of this treatyſe the whiche I do note / and calle it the boke of Surueyng and of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouementes / I do take an olde ſtatute named Extenta manerii / as a principall grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de therof: as herafter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth.</p>
