         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which is not yet decided, &amp; was begun betwixt the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, and <hi>William</hi> duke of <hi>Cleues,</hi> father to this laſt Duke. The <hi>Battauians</hi> or <hi>Hollanders</hi> did alſo hold a part of that which is now called <hi>Gelders.</hi> There is no doubt but in <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi> time, the <hi>Sicambrians</hi> did inhabit on either<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> in the countries of <hi>Cleues</hi> and <hi>Geldres:</hi> as <hi>Wezel</hi> on the one ſide, with <hi>Burich, Cleef</hi> and others of the other ſide are of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of <hi>Cleues:</hi> And of <hi>Geldres, Nymegen</hi> lies of the one ſide and <hi>Arnham</hi> on the other, ſo as we may rightly ſay that the riuers of <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Wahal</hi> do run through theſe two Prouinces: for the <hi>Sicam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brians</hi> hauing often bin defeated by the <hi>Romains, Auguſtus</hi> (who ſucceeded <hi>Caeſar</hi> as <hi>Strabo, Sucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> &amp; others do write) to be the better aſſured of them, and to keepe them in awe, tranſported a good number of them with other people on this ſide the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and there planted them.

Gouernor of a part of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> for the Emperour <hi>Maximillian,</hi> and the Arch-Duke <hi>Philip</hi> his ſonne, who marryed the Lady <hi>Ioane</hi> of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and was afterwards Queen of <hi>Spaine,</hi> after the death of the King <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon</hi> and of Queene <hi>Iſſabelle</hi> of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> her father and mother: whereby the Realmes of <hi>Spaine</hi> came vnto the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and haue continued vnto this day.</p>

whereby the <hi>Hermodures</hi> became more puiſſant; but I hold it a detraction from the <hi>Batauian</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for that they by the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Romans</hi> hauing obtained a great victory, conſtrained the <hi>Cattes</hi> to change their place, and to come to inhabit this Iland of the <hi>Rhyne.</hi> For which cauſe the <hi>Cattes</hi> may with great reaſon bee ſaid to bee the beginning andfirſt Fathers of the <hi>Batauians,</hi> or <hi>Hollanders.</hi> A people renowned for their ſkill in warre, <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> attributing much to their induſtry and dexterity in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of an armie, and alſo in obeying their Commaunders, to take or put of the combat as it ſhould be thought fit; of great courage, firme and hard bodies, wel lymmed, of a fierce and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing aſpect, fearefull for the horrible length of their beardes and hayre, which faſhion and countenance hee ſaith was not lawfull for them to leaue off, or change although they had brought victory from their enemies.</p>

ſo all the country about <hi>Dordrecht,</hi> as it is yet to bee ſeene was loſt.

               <p>The word <hi>Eſtaple</hi> is a <hi>French</hi> word, deriued from the lattin word <hi>Stabulum,</hi> ſo that the word <hi>Staple</hi> is a market or publicke place in a towne ordained for the beſtowing of VVine, Corne, VVood and other Marchandiſe that comes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other countries; euery Towne hauing their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall priuiledges, according to the graunt of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:8921:30"/>
Prince. Not without great greefe and vexation to others both Marchants and Marryners that bring them thether. As for example, The towne of <hi>Arras</hi> is the <hi>Staple</hi> for <hi>Arthois,</hi> and <hi>Valenciennes</hi> for <hi>Henault,</hi> for Wines that are brought out of <hi>France</hi> by land into the <hi>Low-Countries:</hi> So that the Marchants or Carryers are conſtrained to bring them thether before any other place, and there to bee ſtayde a certayne time in the <hi>Staple</hi> to ſee who will buy in the Market, the which beeing done they may carrie them away whether they thinke beſt.</p>
               <p>The towne of <hi>Middlebourgh</hi> in <hi>Zealand</hi> is the <hi>Staple</hi> for Wines that come from <hi>France, Spayne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Portugal</hi> and other Countryes brought thether by Sea. But the priuiledges of the town of <hi>Dordrecht</hi> are more ſtrickt and compelling; for they are of fuch force and vertue, that what-ſouer is brought either by the <hi>Rhyne,</hi> or <hi>Meuze,</hi> be it corne, wine, pitch, cole or any other Marchandiſe paſſing by them, they are compelled (vppon paine of forfeyture of all, if they bee taken, not hauing payed their duty) to diſcharge their boates or barkes in their Hauen, and to paie all rights, cuſtomes, impoſtes and other duties what-ſoeuer, and alſo to diſcharge their Marchaundiſe in Shippes of the towne or of the Cittizens and free Marryners: or elſe to make ſome agreement with them and ſo
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8921:31"/>
they may paſſe them in thoſe that belong to the cuſtome or impoſt. And notwithſtanding that the priuiledges are at this preſent diuers, and vary one from another, according to the nature of the marchandiſe and condition of the townes to whome ſuch priuileges are graunted, yet they haue euer from the firſt beginning beene called by the name of <hi>Eſtaple.</hi> The which (being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in one towne, ſometimes in another, either for the ſcituation or ſome other occation) cauſe a great commodity and benifit to the country both in generall and particuler, and a faire reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and large profit to the Prince of the ſame.</p>
               <p>This towne as the firſt in rancke hath power to coyne both ſiluer and gold, a priueledge deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any other towne of Holland what-ſo-euer.

the middeſt of a good land fit both for tillage and for paſture, enuironed with faire country houſes, Farmes, little woods and many caſtles and villages, and to conclude ſeated reaſonable high, and very pleaſant. It hath one very great Church with a high ſteeple ſupported with great columnes or pillars, and much longer then any other in the Low-countries. There paſſeth now through it a riuer called Sparre, which falls out of a lake of freſh water into the chanell that runnes towards the townes of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and <hi>Leyden,</hi> which is called the ſea of <hi>Harlem;</hi> which riuer hath bene drawne with great labour and charge from that of <hi>Tye</hi> by the ſluces of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendam,</hi> about halfe a league from thence: before the towne on that ſide towards <hi>Leyden</hi> there was heretofore a very pleaſant wood which during the ſeege of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> was cut downe by the <hi>Allamaines</hi> that were quartred on that ſide in the village of <hi>Hemsted;</hi> But within a few yeares after the Magiſtrate of the towne cauſed it to be replanted, ſo as in a ſhort time it became as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant as it was before, ſeruing the inhabitants of the towne for delightfull walkes for the excerſiſe of their ſpirits, and keeping many people of the towne from the Tauernes and ſuch other places, in paſſing their time there.

               <p>Touching the <hi>Etymology</hi> or deriuation of the name, I may not rely vpon <hi>Lewis Guichardine,</hi> who hath followed the old Dutch chronicle of <hi>Holland,</hi> but rather follow that learned Phiſition and Hiſtoriographer of <hi>Horne,</hi> Doctor <hi>Adrianus Iunius,</hi> who affirmes that the <hi>Harlemois</hi> are iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued from the bloud of the Kings of Freezland, who firſt built both the their towne and caſtle in the yeare of the natiuity of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt fiue hundred and ſixe.

no inuention being brought to perfection at the firſt aſſay) and aſſaying to print the ſheet on the other ſide, the right ſide tooke not, and ſo hee ſpoyled the impreſſion.

               <p>This town was firſt founded by <hi>Godfrey</hi> called the crooke-backe Duke of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> who beeing

               <p>This Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> inioyed the ſaid Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome aboue foure yeares, during which time he built the towne of <hi>Delf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the little ſonne of <hi>Geertruyd</hi> being growne ſomewhat bigger with the helpe of neighbour Princes, both <hi>Germaines</hi> (in regard of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) and others, re-entred with a goodly army into <hi>Holland</hi> to giue him battaile, where he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw him, and hauing chaſed him out recouered al his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try: But ſhortly after one of his ſeruants as hee was at the priuy run him into the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with a Iauelin, of which hee died in the towne of <hi>Maeſtricht.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This towne of <hi>Delf</hi> was ſtraightly beſeeged by Count <hi>Albert</hi> of <hi>Bauaria</hi> (as you may read more amply in the hiſtory of the <hi>Netherlands)</hi> ſo as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſtrained to yeeld, the Earle cauſed a great part of the wall to bee throwne down.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:8921:36"/>
of their walles. There befell a pittifull accident to this towne in the month of <hi>Maie</hi> 1536. being ſet on fire by caſualty &amp; the fire ſo diſperſt that it was almoſt burned before there could bee any helpe, yet they wanted not water, for it hath two chanels that paſſe through the towne.</p>
               <p>But the wind being very vehement, ſo diſperſt the fire, that there ſcarce could any thing be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; yet like the <hi>Phaenix</hi> renuing out of her aſhes, this Towne was built againe more fayre and magnificent then euer before, remedying their error in the firſt building (which was the cheefe cauſe of their ruine) by not ſuffering one houſe to bee thatcht with ſtraw; but high and ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly buildings without, with their inward or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments and furnitures ſo neat and fitting that in the whole <hi>Netherlands</hi> it is not to be parraleld; the ſtreets likewiſe ſo cleane and well kept, that notwithſtanding the greateſt rayne there is no durt to touch the ſhoo, ſo as indeed they ſeem to be alwaies waſht.</p>
               <p>In this fire there hapned ſo memorable an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, that (happily) the like hath not beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in antient or moderne ſtorries: It is moſt true that <hi>Pliny</hi> and other authors ſet downe (as a matter of notable and great conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) that the young <hi>Storkes</hi> when the old ones are growne in yeares and paſt helping of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſupply that want by feeding them, and when their winges fayle in paſſing the Sea,

the young ones take them on their backes: But that which hapned of the ſame birds in the towne of <hi>Delph</hi> is of greater conſequence and more remarkeable.</p>
               <p>This towne is ſo ſeated for the feeding and bringing vp of theſe birdes that it is hard to ſee any houſe vppon the which they are not neſted to breed in: This fire hapned vppon the third of <hi>Maie</hi> in the yeare aforeſaid 1536. at which time the young <hi>Storkes</hi> are growne pretty and big, the old ones perceiuing the fire to approch their neſts, attempted to carry them away but could not they were ſo waighty, which they perceiuing neuer ceaſed with their winges ſpread couering them, till they all periſhed in the flames. <hi>Gaſpar Veldius</hi> (an author of reuerent eſteeme) in his booke of <hi>Storkes</hi> recountes the ſame, and alſo <hi>D.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:8921:50"/>
the market place of the ſayd towne ſtands which was called <hi>Roeſtein</hi> by the which the country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple entred into the ſea with their barkes.

               <p>And this beeing in the yeare 1427. they began to compaſſe in this towne with goodly walls and deepe and large ditches.

               <head>Of the Nobility of Holland.</head>
               <p>I Will content my ſelfe with that which diuers Authors haue written touching Nobilitie, how it is pourchaſed and maintained, what the dutie is, and wherein true Nobilitie conſiſts: who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers to be inſtructed, let him read <hi>Adrianus Iuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> in his <hi>Battauia,</hi> in the chapter <hi>De Nobilitate Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauica,</hi> But I will here relate ſuccinctly what the ancient Nobilitie of <hi>Holland</hi> was, how it came to decline, and what hath remained. The anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Nobilitie of <hi>Battauia</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> tooke their greateſt exerciſes in Armes, by the which they ſought the degrees of honour, for as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith. <hi>Vt Gallos pro libertate, Germanos pro praeda, ita Batauos pro gloria ad capeſſendam pugnam olim fuiſſe inſtigatos.</hi> As the <hi>Gaules</hi> for libertie, the <hi>Germaines</hi> for prey, ſo the <hi>Battauians</hi> were in old time prouoked to enter battaile for the deſire of glorie. They were moſt commonly the beſt mounted, and had the faireſt and moſt reſolute troupes of horſe, that ſerued vnder the <hi>Romaine</hi> Emperors.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>Holland</hi> had a particular Prince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with <hi>Thierry</hi> of <hi>Aquitane</hi> their firſt Earle, the Nobility of <hi>Holland</hi> began to ſhew them ſelues, ſo they grew to haue many great and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy families, &amp; a great number of gentlemen, who had pourchaſed their nobility, either from their Anceſtors, or by their own vertues and proweſſe.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:8921:73"/>
But I cannot but lament, that ſo many great, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, riche and mightie families, are now extinct, as well by their inteſtine warres againſt the <hi>Friſons,</hi> as againſt ſtrangers; for which conſideration the heyres males fayling, the ſucceſſions fell to the women, and ſo came to other families: beſides the furie of <hi>Gerard van Velſen</hi> had many companions, all which were put to death, and their neereſt kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men purſued to the death, euen vnto the ninth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree (a moſt cruell reuenge) and ſuch as could eſcape, were forced to become vagabonds in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine countries, ſuch as had hidden themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this furious reuenge was paſt, were afterwards forced to take borrowed names of other families, and to leaue their owne. To come then to that which remaines, and to thoſe which are paſt. We will ſay that the houſe of <hi>Waſſenare</hi> (as wee haue ſaid elſe-where) was the moſt ancient of <hi>Holland:</hi> as it appeares by this common prouerbe <hi>Vaſſenare the most ancient;</hi> Brederode <hi>the most noble</hi> (for that they deſcend from the firſt Earles) <hi>and</hi> Egmond <hi>the most rich.</hi> Wee haue ſcene in this laſt age, <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Waſenare,</hi> the ſubduer of the <hi>Friſons,</hi> a braue and valiant Knight, who was ſlaine in thoſe warres leauing one onely daughter and heire, married to the Earle of <hi>Lingue,</hi> whereby this familie and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name is extinct.</p>
               <p>The memorie of the houſe of <hi>Brederode</hi> may eaſily be found in the Annales of <hi>Holland,</hi> being come from <hi>Ziphard</hi> the ſecond ſonne of <hi>Arnulph</hi>

               <p>The beginning of the houſe of <hi>Egmont</hi> is doubtfull, for the Lordes thereof cannot truly ſhewe a continuance of their deſcent for three hundred yeares: yet they ſay they are iſſued from

                  <hi>Radbod</hi> (I know not which) King of the <hi>Friſons,</hi> but I thinke it would bee a tedious thing to finde out this pedigree.

hee was receiued and acknowledged for Duke in many townes, &amp; the Emperors men chaſed away.

That of <hi>Hattinghen</hi> is one of the moſt ancient races in <hi>Holland,</hi> whereof hiſtories make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aboue ſeauen hundred yeares paſt.

               <p>There haue bene in <hi>Holland</hi> many Abbaies, and Monaſteries, both of men and women, founded by the Nobilitie of the country, beſides Couents of begging Fryars or Bribers, which wee will omit; and treat ſuccinctly of thoſe which were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Noble perſons. Firſt <hi>Thierry</hi> of <hi>Acquitane,</hi> the firſt Earle of <hi>Holland</hi> founded one all of wood for women: the which his ſon cauſed to be built of ſtone for Monkes, and bee made an Abbaie neere vnto the Village of <hi>Egmond</hi> (whereof the Abbot did afterwards weare a Miter) inricht with great reuenues, which made both the Abbot and his Monkes too idle. And ſeeing wee are diſcourſing of this Abbaie, I muſt by the way deliuer a tricke which this Abbot plaid in the yeare 1565. with the Earle of <hi>Egmond:</hi> The Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Horne</hi> and the Baron of <hi>Brederode</hi> went with the Earle of <hi>Egmont</hi> to dine in this Abbaie,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:8921:82"/>
where they were very honourablie entertained, when as they ſhoulde waſh, my Lord Abbot (who was but a Monke) tooke theſe three Noble men by the handes to waſh: The Earle of <hi>Egmond</hi> comming to preſent him-ſelfe, the Abbot ſayd vnto him; No, for you are my Vaſſall, it becomes you not to waſh with your better, yea he offred to put the towell vppon his ſhoulder, to giue it vnto the other Noblemen, when they had waſht, whereat the Earle of <hi>Egmond</hi> was much diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and went away curſing the Monke. One of the Abbots ſeruantes, who was then preſent, reported it vnto mee for a very truth. VVithout doubt it was a great affront vnto this Earle, who was proude and high minded, valuing him-ſelfe more then the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who was iſſued from the race of the Emperours, by the Emperor <hi>Adolph</hi> of <hi>Naſſau.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were foure Abbaies for women, into the which not any one might be receiued, that was not Nobly borne, or at the leaſt that had not their Armes quartered.

Although I bee well acquainted with the high and low Dutch tongue, yet I muſt confeſſe that in this ancient <hi>Friſon</hi> language I vnderſtand nothing.</p>
               <p>Wee haue ſayd before that the <hi>Friſons</hi> did for a time entertaine themſelues vnder factions, wee muſt therefore relate ſuccinctly the beginning thereof: which was that in the yeare of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. 1390. there did riſe two factions in the country of <hi>Friſland,</hi> the one <hi>Vetcoopers,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies in their vulgar tongue, marchants of greaſe, that is to ſay, marchants of fat oxen, which they hold for an honeſt kinde of marchandiſe, and of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:8921:122"/>
                  <hi>Schyeringers,</hi> which are butchers and ſellers of tripes, which is a baſe kinde of trade, which facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they ſay came from Eaſt and Weſt <hi>Friſland.</hi> The firſt ſpring and beginning thereof was; that all theſe marchants of cattell and the butchers bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing togither at a publick banket according to their cuſtome, there was a gueſt to chooſe a Prouoſt, a Deane or a King amongſt them, whoſe charge ſhould bee to looke that no diſorder ſhould bee committed, which might trouble the companie. There was amongſt them of either of theſe two companies, one that exceeded the reſt, and both e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall in wealth, in reſpect and loue towards all the gueſts. Whom both the one and the other partie contended to choſe, their Deane, Prouoſt or King: the one and the other maintayning that this digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; authority at the table, was moſt befitting him that had the honeſteſt trade. Wherevpon a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on grew among them, which of thoſe two marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe was the honeſteſt: the one preferring the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of cattell, the other the butchers. Vpon which diſpute their braines being het with wine, in the end they fell from words to blowes one againſt an other, party againſt party, euery one with his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and Kinſmen, meaning to maintaine the one quarrell or the other: ſo as in the end there was a great fight, in the which many were either hurt or ſlaine. In reuenge whereof, either party holding it ſelfe wronged, they began to make factions, and to bandie one againſt an other: ſo as this canker eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:8921:122"/>
more and more; ſtrangers (who had no intereſt, nor were any way wronged) ingaged themſelues, vpon hope of bootie of the one or the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: euerie one wreſting what hee could from his Aduerſarie, without either lawe or iuſtice (ſo confuſed were things then and full of diſorder) but ſuch as they made by the ſworde, where as the ſtrongeſt carried it. The fruits of theſe facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were ſuch, as they not onely rained amongſt priuate perſons, but amongſt whole fam lies, vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, bourrougs and townes, yea among whole Prouinces, ſo as the whole country was ful of thefts and murthers, and no man was free from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies. In like maner about that time <hi>Holla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi> was afflicted with the factions of <hi>Hoecks</hi> and <hi>Cabillaux</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Hameſons</hi> and the <hi>Merlus,</hi> wherof we haue made mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heretofore: which was, that the one party (as the <hi>Merlus</hi> or <hi>Coddes</hi> bee fiſhes which prey) did threaten to deuower the other: and they of the <hi>Hameſons</hi> did threaten to take the others by the throat: which to ſpeake truth were quarrels ſcarce fit for children. And at that time were the factions of <hi>Gelphes &amp; Gibelins</hi> in <hi>Italy:</hi> Of the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of colloured caps in <hi>Flanders,</hi> &amp; of thoſe of the ſtarre in <hi>France,</hi> al which were factions raiſed from the diuill. This miſchiefe proceeded ſo farre in <hi>Friſland,</hi> as from the leſſe it came to the greater, and from Marchants and Bourgers to the Nobility and Clergie: The gentlemen ruining the houſes &amp; caſtles one of an other: and the Abbots and Monks doing al the miſchief they could one vnto an other:
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:8921:123"/>
So as to appeaſe theſe factions, and to reconcile the Noblemen, the Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> the firſt, ſent <hi>Otto van Langen</hi> to perſwade them to chooſe a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtat amongſt them, which ſhould gouerne the country according to their preuiledges, vnder the authority of the Empire. But their ſplene was ſo great, as euery one ſeeking to chooſe one of their faction, the ſayd commiſſioner preuailed nothing, but returned as hee came. So as the Emperour to force them to an accord, tooke occaſion to giue the gouernment hereditary of all <hi>Friſland</hi> and <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> to the houſe of <hi>Saxony,</hi> to hold it in fee of the Empire.</p>
               <p>For the attayning whereof, the Dukes of <hi>Saxony</hi> hauing ſpent a great part of their means with ſmall profit, finding this people ſo impatient of a ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers yoake, in the end Duke <hi>George</hi> reſigned all his intereſt vnto the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth who enioyed it quietly, as his ſonne <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spaine</hi> alſo did, till within theſe thirty yeares that they freed themſelues by their adiunction vnto the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall vnion of the confederate Prouinces of the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> Thus much we haue thought good to ſpeake of the beginning and Eſtate of <hi>Friſland</hi> in generall; Now wee will deſcribe the townes in particular.</p>

In witneſſe whereof, there are yet in this towne two Temples, the one named the ancient court, the other the new, whereof the gentlemen of the country were in former times called <hi>Hovelingen,</hi> that is to ſay courtiers, for that they were conſtituted publike defenders of this houſe of <hi>God</hi> taught by the <hi>Druides.</hi> And in truth this towne hath more gentlemen in it, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other in <hi>Friſland.</hi> Of this ſchoole of the <hi>Druides, Synard</hi> the wiſe, a diuine and councellor to <hi>Radbod</hi> the laſt King of the <hi>Friſons</hi> was Rector, whom hee councelled to perſecute the Chriſtians; hee cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and cauſed <hi>Tullies</hi> bookes of the nature of the Gods to bee burnt, condemning them as full of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and contrarie to the doctrine which they taught, of the falſe Gods of the gentills.

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:8921:146"/>
in that which concernes their iuriſdiction, from the which no man of what quality ſo euer may decline<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> moreouer the towne is Lady and miſtriſſe of her owne lawes and ſtatutes, the which by a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne power they may make and vndoe, create and abrogate without the authority of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The Eſtates of the <hi>Ommelands</hi> haue alſo the like authority in their regard. The towne hath had a priuiledge to coyne ſiluer and copper for theſe foure hundred years, and gold ſince the yeare. 1474.</p>
               <p>The Magiſtracy of the towne conſiſts as it hath done time out of mind, of foure Bourgue-maiſters and twelue Senators (but of late daies, for before they were wont to haue 16.) which are the head of the common-weale, all hauing equal voices, but not equall in dignity and authority. This Senat takes knowledge of all that concernes the towne: they haue power to chooſe the <hi>Hoftmans</hi> or Pretors of the country &amp; to ſend ambaſſages wher need ſhould require: to conclude, their duty is to prouide both in general &amp; particular for the good of the common weale. Their charge is for two yeares and they are created with ſuch order as euery yeare eight are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and other eight ſubrogated in their places, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the which I comprehend the Bourguemaiſter.</p>
               <p>After the Senat and <hi>Hoftmans,</hi> there is within the towne a colledge of 24. men, choſen out of the beſt families, which they cal the ſworne councellors for that from yeare to yeare they binde them-ſelues by oth to the Common-weale of <hi>Groning,</hi> without
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:8921:147"/>
whome the Senat cannot reſolue of any matters of importance, concerning the whole common-weale as to vndertake a warre, or to giue it ouer; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract alliances, make lawes or to breake them, build new forts or other publike workes: change their mony; bring the towne in debt or chtage it with rents otherwiſe: To treat of which things, the ſenat cauſeth them to be called, which haue beene depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, whom they call the old ſenat: and ſome-times they call ſome of the beſt cittizens of the towne, as the Deans or maiſter of the cheefe trades, men of great credit among the people. This colledg of foure and twenty ſworne men, hath as it were a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umuirat, which ſpeakes for them all, and bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by oth vnto the Senat, to procure the townes good, and to make a faithful report of all, the which may properly bee called <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the people.</p>
               <p>There are many other offices in the towne, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for the entertainment and preſeruation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: as Prouoſts of the wacth, Maiſters of quarters: Heads, Captaine or <hi>Deans</hi> of the ſworne compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, whom the Senat doth chooſe for life: Maiſters of workes, ouerſeers of the waights and meſures for bread and beere. To conclude, it ſeemes there wants nothing for a well gouerned common-weale.</p>
               <p>The manner of choſing the Magiſtrat in that towne is as followeth. One halfe of the councell which are ſixeteene and of the twenty foure ſworne men are yeerely depoſed, whoſe places are filled by fiue perſonages well qualified among the twenty

foure Iurats whome the Gouernor of the Prouince doth name, which fiue do chooſe out of all the towne eight new councellors, to fill vp the places of them that are depoſed, which eight newly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, with eight old remaining, choſe foure Bourgue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſters, more-ouer the Gouernor names (beſides the twenty foure ſworne men) fiue other men who chooſe twelue among the commons of the towne, to fill vp the place of twelue that were depoſed, ſo the twelue new Iurats with the tw elue of the old remayning, make vp the number of tw enty foure, all which together chooſe the three Tribunes.</p>
               <p>There is alſo in that towne an ordinarie free ſchole or rather a colledge, which is very famous by reaſon of Doctor <hi>Vbbo Emmius,</hi> an excellent Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographer, who was Rector and go uerned it: of whoſe writing we haue for the moſt part made vſe, in the deſcription of <hi>Freeſeland.</hi>

               <p>By this deſcription may be ſeene, that in the ſaid eight vnited Prouinces, which make the Eſtates of the <hi>Belgike</hi> Common-weale, there are aboue ſixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore townes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> great and ſmall, and aboue a hundred caſtles and forts of all ſorts, entertained with ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie garriſons, beſides their troupes of reſerue which they put into townes, eſpeciallie in winter, or when they haue neede to refreſh their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies either of foote or horſe, where they are well lodged and accommodated.</p>
               <p>Touching the ſhippes of warre which the vnited Eſtates doe vſually entertaine, as well at ſea, as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the riuers of <hi>Rhine, Meuſe, Wahal, Ems</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I cannot ſet downe the number, the which is great, ſome-times more, ſome-times leſſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the neceſſitie of their affaires: they haue ſome-times a hundred and twenty ſhippes of warre in paie, well armed and appointed with men and munition. Their nauigation and trafficke of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe extends to the Eaſt, Weſt, North and South. I dare boldly ſaie, that the Common-weale of <hi>Venice,</hi> which is held ſo ritch and mighty an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, could not haue continued ſuch inteſtine wars

               <p>Wherefore wee muſt conclude that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> was ill aduiſed to intreate them with ſuch rigor, as they haue beene forced to oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and to ſhake off his yoake.
