         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Latimers</hi> Speech, when sometimes I sit
alone, and have a setled assurance of
the state of my Soul, and know that
God is my God, I can laugh at all
troubles, and nothing can daunt me:
Godliness puts a man in heaven before
his time. Christian, aspire after Piety,
it is a lawful Ambition: Look upon the
Saints <hi>Characters</hi> here, and never
leave till thou hast gotten them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stamped
upon thy own Soul. This is
the grand business that should swallow
up your time and thoughts: Other
Speculations, and Quaint Notions, are
nothing to the Soul: They are like
Wafers which have fine works printed
upon them, and are curiously damasked
to the eye, but are thin, and yield lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
nourishment. But I will not stay
you longer in the Porch; should I have
inlarged upon any one Character of the
Godly Man, it would have required a

I have contracted my Sails, and given

This is an incomprehensible blessing, and
such as layes a foundation for all other mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
I shall but glance at it, and lay down
these five Assertions about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Forgiveness of sin is an act of Gods
Free Grace. The Greek word to <hi>forgive</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note>deciphers the Original of pardon; it ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
not from any thing inherent in us, but
is the pure result of Free Grace. <hi>Isa. 43. 25.
I, even I am he, that blotteth out thy transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
for mine own sake.</hi> When a Creditor
forgives a Debtor, he doth it freely. Pardon
of sin is a fine thread spun out of the bowels
of Free Grace. <hi>Paul</hi> cries out, <hi>I obtained mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
1 Tim.</hi> 1. 13. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>I was be-mercied:</hi>
he who is pardoned, is all bestrewed with
mercy. When the Lord pardons a sinner,
he doth not pay a Debt, but give a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. God in forgiving sin, remits the guilt
and penalty. Guilt cries for justice; no
sooner had <hi>Adam</hi> eaten the Apple, but he
saw the <hi>flaming sword,</hi> and heard the Curse;
but in remission God doth indulge the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
he seems to say thus to him, Though
thou art fallen into the hands of my Justice,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106547:5"/>
and deservest to die, yet I will absolve thee,
and whatever is charged upon thee, shall be
discharged.</p>
               <p>3. Forgiveness of sin is through the blood <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
of Christ. Free grace is the impulsive cause,
Christs<note n="*" place="margin">Christus se in cruce Deo oblatus est sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, sic nostra pians peccata. <hi>Maresius de ver. rel. lib.</hi> 3.</note> blood is the meritorious. <hi>Heb. 9. 22:
Without shedding of blood is no remission.</hi>
Justice would be revenged either on the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
or the surety. Every pardon is <hi>the price
of blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Before sin is forgiven, it must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of. Therefore repentance and remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
are linked together. <hi>Luk. 24. 47. That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
repentance and remission of sins should be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in his Name</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Da Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </note>. Not that repentance
doth in a Popish sense merit forgiveness;
Christs blood must wash our Tears: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
is a <hi>qualification,</hi> though not a <hi>cause.</hi>
He who is humbled for sin will the more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
pardoning mercy. When there is nothing
in the soul but clouds of sorrow, and now
God brings a pardon, which is a setting up
a Rainbow in the Cloud, to tell the sinner,
that the flood of wrath shall not overflow
him; O what joy is there at the sight of
this Rainbow! The soul that before was
steeped in tears, now melts in love to God.
<hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 38. 47.</p>
               <p>5. God having forgiven sin, he will call it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>

Lord will make an<note n="*" place="margin">Peccata semel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missa nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deunt.</note> act of Indempnity, he
will not upbraid us with former unkindnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
or sue us with a cancelled Bond. <hi>Micah
7. 19. he will cast our sins into the depth of the
sea.</hi> Sin shall not be cast in as <hi>Cork</hi> which
riseth up again; but as <hi>Lead</hi> which sinks to

this Covenant-blessing!</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. <hi>How sad is it to want it!</hi> It must needs
be ill with the Malefactor who wants his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:
all the Curses of God stand in full
force against the unpardoned sinner; his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
blessings are cursed. <hi>Mal. 2. 2. Caesar</hi>
wondred at one of his Souldiers, that was so
merry when he was in debt. Can the sinner
be merry who is heir to all Gods Curses,
and knows not how soon he may take up his
Lodgings among the damned?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>How sweet is it to have it!</hi> 1. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned

Every one that is godly.</head>
               <p>IT will first be enquired, <hi>What Godliness
is?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</note>
               </p>
               <p>I answer in general,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> Godliness is the sacred
impression, and workmanship of God in a
man, whereby of carnal he is made spiritual.
When Godliness is wrought in a person, he
doth not receive a new soul, but he hath

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; Godliness is not the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106547:7"/>
feaverish conceit of a sick brain; a Christian
is no Enthusiast, one whose Religion is made
up all of Fancy; Godliness hath <hi>Truth</hi> for
its foundation; it is called <hi>the way of Truth,</hi>

                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 30. godliness is a ray and beam

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Godliness is an <hi>intrinsecal</hi> thing: it lies
chiefly in the heart. <hi>Rom. 2. 29. Circumcision
is that of the heart.</hi> The dew lies on the leaf,
the sap is hid in the root. The Moralists Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is

                  <hi>Psal. 51. 6. in the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3, Godliness is a <hi>supernatural</hi> thing: by
nature we inherit nothing but evil. <hi>Rom. 7. 5.
When we were in the flesh, the motions of sin did
work in our members:</hi> we did suck in sin, as
naturally as our Mothers milk; but godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is the <hi>wisdom from above,</hi> Jam. 3. 17. it
is breathed in from heaven. God must light
up the Lamp of Grace in the heart: Weeds
grow of themselves, flowers are planted.
Godliness is a Coelestial Plant, that comes
from the New <hi>Hierusalem:</hi> Therefore it is
called a <hi>fruit of the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5. 22. A man
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106547:7"/>
hath no more power to <hi>change</hi> himself than
to <hi>create</hi> himself.</p>
               <p>4. Godliness is an <hi>extensive</hi> thing; it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
a sacred leaven that spreads it self into the
whole soul. 1 <hi>Thess. 5. 23. The God of peace
sanctifie you wholly.</hi> There is light in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
order in the affections, pliable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the will, exemplariness in the life.
We do not call a Blackamore white because
he hath white teeth: he is not godly who is
good only in some part. Grace is called <hi>the
new man,</hi> Col. 3. 10. not a new eye, or tongue,
but a new man: he who is godly is good all
over; though he be regenerate but in part,
yet it is in every part.</p>
               <p>5. Godliness is an <hi>intense</hi> thing; it doth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
not lye in a dead formality and indifferency,
but is vigorous and flaming, <hi>Rom. 12. 11.
Fervent in spirit.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates sunt in subjecto intensive.</note> We call water hot, when
it is so in the third or fourth degree. He is
godly whose devotion is inflamed, and his
heart boyls over in holy affections.</p>
               <p>6. Godliness is <hi>a glorious</hi> thing: As the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
Jewel to the Ring, so is Piety to the Soul
bespangling it in Gods eyes. <hi>Reason</hi> makes
us Men, <hi>Godliness</hi> makes us earthly Angels;
by it we <hi>partake of the divine nature,</hi> 2 Pet.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 7. Godliness is a <hi>permanent</hi> thing. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>

<note n="†" place="margin">1 Sam. 17. 42.</note>A blush of godliness is not enough to
denominate a Christian, but godliness must

Godliness is a fixed thing: There is a great
deal of difference between a Stake in the
Hedge, and a Tree in the Garden; a stake
rots and moulders, but a tree having life in

thirsts after him; the more he hath of God,
the more still he desires; a sip of the Wine

When the Soul is once like God, it would

why cannot you do as others? Why will

and Indentures sealed between him and

Indentures are renewed and sealed; we do
there bind our selves to God to be his sworn
servants, <hi>Psal. 119. 106. I have sworn, and I

If a Master leap over hedge and ditch, the

follow Christ through afflictions, <hi>Luk. 9. 23.
If any man will come after me, let him take up
his Cross daily, and follow me. Peter</hi> would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Christ <hi>upon the water:</hi> A godly man will
follow Christ though it be death every step;
he will keep his goodness, when others are
bad; as all the water in the salt Sea cannot
make the Fish salt, but still they retain their
freshness; so all the wickedness in the world
cannot make a godly man wicked, but still he
retains his piety; he will follow Christ in
the worst times.</p>
                  <p>6. A servant is satisfied with his Masters <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
allowance; he doth not say, I will have such
provisions made ready, if he hath short com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
he doth not find fault; he knows he
is a servant, and is at his Masters carving: In
this sense a godly man is Gods servant; he
is willing to be at Gods allowance; if he
hath but some leavings he doth not grumble.
<hi>Paul</hi> knew he was a servant, therefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more or less fell to his share, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 4. When Christians mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
at their condition, they forget that
they are servants, and must be at the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106547:27"/>
of their Heavenly Master: Thou that
hast the least bit from God, wilt die in his

of his Master; he cannot hear his Master re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
but will vindicate his credit. Thus
every godly man will stand up for the honor
of his Master Christ, <hi>Psal. 119. 139. My zeal

when we are ductill and frameable to

                  <p>1. Thou that hast learned all thy postures,

What a cooling card will this be at that day?</p>
                  <p>2. What doth a man get by sinfully insla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
himself? he gets a blot in his name, a
curse in his estate, an hell in his Conscience,
nay, even those that he basely stoops to, will
scorn and despise him. How did the High-Priests

We read, that those who had passed
over the Sea of Glass, stood with their

for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>2. The second thing to be illustrated is,

the beauties and glories of this visible world,
than the appletree doth surpass the trees of

<hi>Moses was skill'd in all the knowledge of

is of good use to prepare for the study of
better things; as a courser dye prepares the
cloath for a richer and a deeper dye: but the
fault is, when the study of Christ is neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
The knowledge of Christ ought to have

One leaf of this Tree of Life, will give us
more comfort on a death-bed, than the whole

What is it to know all the motions of the

be a Christ-prizer? then let us try our god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
by this: Do we set an high estimation
upon Christ?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> How shall we know that?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If we are prizers of Christ, then
we prefer him in our judgements before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things: We value Christ above honor
and riches; the <hi>Pearl of Price</hi> lies neerest
our heart: He who prizeth Christ, esteems
the gleanings of Christ better than the
worlds Vintage: He counts the worst things
of Christ better than the best things of the
world, <hi>Heb. 11. 26. Esteeming the reproach of
Christ greater riches, than the treasures in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi>
And is it thus with us? Is the price
of worldly things fallen? <hi>Gregory Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zene</hi>
did solemnly bless God, that he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing to lose for Christs<note n="*" place="margin">Naz.</note> sake But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,
how few <hi>Nazianzenes</hi> are to be found:
You shall hear some say, they have honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thoughts of Christ, but they prize their
Land and Estate above him. The young
man in the Gospel preferred his bags of gold
before Christ: <hi>Iudas</hi> valued thirty pieces of
silver above him: May it not be feared, if an
hour of tryal come, there are many would
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106547:35"/>
rather renounce their Baptisme, and throw
off Christs Livery, than hazard the loss of
their earthly possessions for him.</p>
                  <p>2. If we are prizers of Christ, we cannot
live without him; things which we value, we
know not how to be without: A man may
live without musick, but not without food.
A Childe of God can want health and
friends, but he cannot want Christ: In the
absence of Christ he saith as <hi>Iob,</hi> I went
<hi>mourning without the Sun, Iob</hi> 30. 28. I have
the star-light of creature-comforts, but I
want the <hi>Sun of Righteousness.</hi> Give me
<hi>Children</hi> (said <hi>Rachel) or I die, Gen.</hi> 30. 1. So
saith the Soul, Lord give me Christ, or I die;
one drop of the Water of Life to quench my
thirst: Let us try by this, do they prize
Christ, who can make a shift well enough to
be without him? Give a childe a rattle, and
it will not mind gold: If men have but
worldly accommodations, <hi>corn</hi> and <hi>wine,</hi> they
can be well enough content without Christ:
Christ is a Spiritual <hi>Rock, 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 4. Let
men have but <hi>oyl in the cruse,</hi> they care not
for honey out of this Rock: If their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
be gone, they complain, but if God takes
away the Gospel, which is the Ark wherein
Christ the Manna is hid, they are quiet and
tame enough: Do these prize Christ, who
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106547:36"/>
can sit down content without him?</p>
                  <p>3. If we are prizers of Christ, then we

who prizeth gold, will dig for it in the <hi>Mine,
Psa. 63. 8. My Soul followeth hard after God.
Plutarch</hi> reports of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> an antient
people in <hi>France,</hi> after they had tasted the
sweet wine of the Italian Grape, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
after the country, and never rested
till they had arrived at it. He in whose eye
Christ is precious, never rests till he hath
gotten Christ, <hi>Cant. 3. 1, 2, 4. I sought him
whom my soul loveth, I held him, and would no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

let him go.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Try by this! Many say they have
Christ in high Veneration, but they are not
industrious in the use of means to obtain
him. If Christ would drop as a ripe fig into
their mouth, they could be content to have
him, but they will not put themselves to
too much trouble to get him: Doth he prize
his health, who will not put himself upon
physick or exercise?</p>
                  <p>4. If we are prizers of Christ, then we
take much complacency in Christ: What
joy doth a man take in that which he counts
his treasure? He who prizeth Christ, makes
him the <hi>Head</hi> of his joy: He can delight in
Christ, when other delights are gone, <hi>Hab. 3.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106547:36"/>
17. Though the fig-tree doth not flourish, yet I
will rejoyce in the Lord.</hi> Though a flower in a
mans garden die, yet he can delight in his
money and Jewels: He who esteems Christ,
can solace himself in Christ, when there is an
Autumn upon all other comforts.</p>
                  <p>5. If we are prizers of Christ, then we
will part with our dearest lusts for him. <hi>Paul</hi>
saith of the <hi>Galathians,</hi> they did so esteem
him, that they were <hi>ready to have pulled out
their own eyes, and have given him, Gal.</hi> 4, 15.
He who esteems Christ, will pull out that
lust, which is his <hi>right eye.</hi> A wise man will
throw away a poyson for a cordial: He who
sets an high value upon Christ, will part with
his pride, unjust gain, sinful<note n="†" place="margin">Isaiah 30. 22.</note> fashions: He
will set his feet upon the neck of his sins.</p>
                  <p>Try by this! How can they be said to
prize Christ, who will not leave a vanity for
him? Not a spot in the face, not an oath,
not an intemperate cup: What a scorn and
contempt do they put upon the Lord Jesus,
who prefer a damning lust, before a saving
Christ.</p>
                  <p>6. If we are prizers of Christ, we shall
think we cannot have him at too dear a rate.
We may buy gold too dear, but we cannot
purchase Christ too dear: Though we part
with our bloud for him, it is no dear bargain:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106547:37"/>
The Apostles rejoyced that they were graced
so much, as to be disgraced for Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.
41. They esteemed their fetters more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
than bracelets of gold: Let not him
say he prizeth Christ, who refuseth to bear
his Cross, <hi>Mat. 13. 21. When persecution ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

                  </p>
                  <p>7. If we are prizers of Christ, we will be
willing to help others to a part in him; that
which we esteem excellent, we are desirous
our friend should have a share in: If a man
hath found a Spring of water, he will call o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that they may drink, and satisfie their
thirst. Do we commend Christ to others?
Do we take them by the hand, and lead them
to Christ? This shows how few prize Christ,
because they strive no more that their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
should have a part in him: They get land
and riches for their posterity, but have no
care to leave them the <hi>Pearl of Price</hi> for
their portion.</p>
                  <p>8. If we are prizers of Christ, then we
prize him in health as well as in sickness;
when we are inlarged, as well as when we are
straitned: A friend is prized at all times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

thoughts: Let us consider,</p>
                  <p>1. We cannot prize Christ at too high a
rate; we may prize other things above their
worth; that is our sin, we commonly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the creature; we think there is more in
it than there is; therefore God withers our
gourd, because we over-prize it: But we
cannot raise our esteem high enough of
Christ, he is beyond all value: There is no
Ruby or Diamond but the Jeweller can set
a just price upon it, he can say it is worth so
much, and no more; but Christs worth can
never be fully known: No Seraphim can set
a due value on him; his are <hi>unsearchable

So sin <hi>wars against the Soul, 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 11. And
no cessation of arms till death; will not this
cause tears?</p>
                  <p>3. A Childe of God weeps that he is
sometimes overcome by the prevalency of
Corruption, <hi>Rom. 7. 19. The evil I would
not, that do I. Paul</hi> was like a man carried
down the stream: How oft is a Saint over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred
with pride and passion! When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
had sinned, he steeped his Soul in the
brinish tears of Repentance: It cannot but
grieve a regenerate person to think he should
be so foolish, as after he hath felt the smart of
sin, yet to put this fire in his bosom again.</p>
                  <p>4. A godly heart grieves that he can be
no more holy; it troubles him that he shoots
so short of the Rule and Standard which
God hath set: I should, faith he, love the
Lord <hi>with all my heart:</hi> But how defective
is my love? how far short do I come of what
I should be, nay, of what I might have been:
What can I see in my life, but either blanks
or blots?</p>
                  <p>5. A godly man weeps sometimes, out of
the sense of Gods love: Gold is the finest
and most solid of all the metals, yet is soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
melted with the fire: Gracious hearts,
which are golden hearts, are the soonest melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106547:40"/>
into tears by the fire of Gods love. I once
knew an holy man, who walking in his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and shedding plenty of tears, a friend
coming to him accidentally, asked him, why
he wept? He brake forth into this patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
expression, <hi>O the love of Christ, the love of
Christ,</hi> Thus have we seen the Cloud melted
into water by the Sun-beams.</p>
                  <p>6. A godly person weeps, because the sins
he commits are in some sense worse than the
sins of other men; the sin of a justified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is very odious.</p>
                  <p>1. Because he acts contrary to his own
principles; he doth not only sin against the
Rule, but against his Principles, against his
knowledge, vows, prayers, hopes, experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
He knows how dear sin will cost him,
yet he adventures upon the forbidden fruit.</p>
                  <p>2. The sin of a Justified person is odious,
because it is a sin of unkindness, 2 <hi>King. 11. 9.
Peters</hi> denying of Christ was a sin against
love; Christ had enrolled him among the
Apostles, he had taken him up into the
Mount of Transfiguration, and showed him
the glory of Heaven in a Vision; yet after
all this signal Mercy, that he should deny
Christ, it was high ingratitude. This made
him go out and <hi>weep bitterly, Mat.</hi> 26. 75.

these <hi>grieve</hi> him: The sins of the wicked
pierce Christ sides, the sins of the godly
wound his heart; the unkindness of a Spouse
goes neerest the heart of her Husband.</p>
                  <p>3. The sin of a Justified person is odious,
because it reflects more dishonor upon God,
2 <hi>Sam. 12. 14. By this deed, thou hast given oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to the Enemies of the Lord to blaspheme.</hi>
The sins of Gods people put black spots in
the face of Religion. Thus we see what cause
there is, why a Childe of God should weep
even after Conversion.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now this sorrow of a godly man for sin,
is not a despairing sorrow; he doth not <hi>mourn</hi>
without hope. <hi>Psal. 65. 3. Iniquities prevail
against me:</hi> There is the Holy Soul weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<hi>as for our transgressions thou shalt purge
them away:</hi> There is Faith triumphing.</p>
                  <p>Divine sorrow is excellent: There is as
much difference between the sorrow of a
godly man and a wicked, as between the
water of a Spring which is clear and sweet,
and the water of the Sea which is salt and
brackish. A godly mans sorrow hath these
three qualifications,</p>

did a man take such delight in a dish that

And indeed, how can a Saint chuse but take
great complacency in the Word, because all

in it: Doth not a son take pleasure in reading
over his Fathers Will and Testament, where
he makes a conveyance of his Estate to him?</p>
                  <p>4. He shows his love to the Word, by
hiding it, <hi>Psal. 119. 11. Thy Word have I hid
in my heart:</hi> As one hides a treasure that it

Jewel, the heart is the Cabinet where it must

<hi>That I might be kept from sinning against thee.</hi>
As one would carry an Antidote about him,

                  <p>7. He shows his love to the Word by
talking of it, <hi>Psal. 119. 172. My tongue shall
speak of thy Word.</hi> As a covetous man is
talking of his rich purchase, so a godly man
is speaking of the Word: what a treasure it

                  <p>8. He shows his love to the Word by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming

by which he sets his life, the balance in which
he weighs his actions; he copies out the

2. A godly man loves <hi>the Word Preached;</hi>
which is a Commentary upon the word writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:
The Scriptures are the Soveraign oyls
and balsoms, the preaching of the word is
the powring of them out: The Scriptures are
the precious spices, the preaching of the
word is the beating of these spices, which
causeth a wonderful fragrancy and delight.
The word preached is <hi>the Rod of Gods
strength, Psal.</hi> 110. 2. and <hi>the breath of his
lips, Isa.</hi> 11. 4. What was once said of the
City <hi>Thebes,</hi> that it was built by the sound
of <hi>Amphius</hi> his Harp, is much more true of
Soul-Conversion, it is built by the sound of
the Gospel Harp; therefore the preaching
of the Word is called, <hi>the power of God to
Salvation, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 24. By this, Christ is
said, (now) to speak to us from Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi>
12. 5. This Ministery of the word is to be
preferred before the Ministry of Angels.</p>
                  <p>A godly man loves the word preached,
partly from the good he hath found by it;
he hath felt the dew fall with this Manna;
and partly because of Gods Institution, the
Lord hath appointed this Ordinance to save
him; the Kings Image makes the Coyn go
currant; the stamp of Divine Authority up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the word preached, makes it an Engine
conducible to mens Salvation.</p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:106547:46"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vse.</note> Let us try by this Character, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we are godly: Are we lovers of the
word?</p>
                  <p>1. Do we love the <hi>word written?</hi> What
sums of money did the Martyrs give for a
few leaves of the Bible? Do we make the
word our <hi>familiar?</hi> As <hi>Moses</hi> had often <hi>the
Rod of God</hi> in his hand, so should we have
<hi>the Book of God</hi> in our hand: when we want
direction, do we consult with this sacred Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle?
when we find corruptions strong, do we
make use of this <hi>Sword of the Spirit</hi> to hew
them down? when we are disconsolate, do
we go to this <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> bottle for comfort?
then we are lovers of the word! But alas,
how can they say they love the Scriptures,
who are seldome conversant in them? their
eyes begin to be sore when they look upon a
Bible: The two Testaments are hung by,
like rusty Armour, which is seldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
made use of: The Lord wrote the Law
with <hi>his own finger,</hi> but though God took
pains to write, men will not take pains to
read; they had rather look upon a pair of
Cards, then upon a Bible.</p>
                  <p>2. Do we love the <hi>word preached?</hi> Do
we prize it in our judgements? Do we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it into our hearts? Do we fear the loss
of the word preached, more than the loss of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:106547:47"/>
peace and trading? Is it the removal of the
Ark that troubles us?</p>
                  <p>Again, do we attend the Word with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verential
Devotion? when the Judge is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Charge upon the Bench all attend,
when the word is preached, the great God is
giving us his Charge, do we listen to it as to
a matter of life and death? this is a good
sign we love the word.</p>
                  <p>Again, do we love the Sanctity of the
word? <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 140. The word preached
is to beat down sin, and advance holiness:
Do we love it for its spirituality and purity?
Many love the word preached only for its
eloquence and notion; they come to a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
as to a Musick-lecture, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31.
or as to a garden to pick flowers, but not to
have their lusts subdued, or their hearts bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered:
These are like a foolish woman which
paints her face<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but neglects her health.</p>
                  <p>Again, do we love the convictions of the
word? Do we love the word when it comes
home to our Conscience, and shoots its ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
of reproof at our sins? 'Tis the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
duty sometimes to reprove: He that
can give smooth words in the Pulpit, but
knows not how to reprove, is like a sword
with a fine hilt, without an edge, <hi>Titus 2. 15.
Rebuke them sharply:</hi> Dip the nail in oyl, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106547:47"/>
in love, but strike the nail home. Now
Christian, when the word toucheth upon
thy sin, and saith, <hi>Thou art the man,</hi> dost thou
love the reproof? Canst thou bless God that
<hi>the sword of the Spirit</hi> hath divided between
thee and thy lusts? This is indeed a sign of
grace, and shows thou art a lover of the
word.</p>
                  <p>A corrupt heart loves the comforts of the
word, but not the reproofs, <hi>Amos 5. 10. They
hate him that rebuketh in the gate.</hi>
                     <q>—Igne micant oculi—</q>
Like venomous creatures, that upon the
least touch spit poyson, <hi>Act. 7. 54. When
they heard these things they were cut to the
heart, and gnashed upon him with their teeth.</hi>
When <hi>Stephen</hi> touched them to the quick,
they were mad, and could not endure<note n="*" place="margin">Quales quaeso illi sunt, qui verbi redargutiones accipere nolunt, sed contra, obstinati murmurant, &amp; Ministros verbi Caelestis ob id odio prosequuntur?

reproofs of the word?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. When we desire to sit under an
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106547:48"/>
heart-searching Ministry; who cares for
Physick that will not work? A godly man
chuseth not to sit under such a Ministry as
will not work upon his Conscience.</p>
                  <p>2. When we pray that the word may
meet with our sins; if there be any traiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
lust got into our heart, we would have
it found out, and Execution done upon it;
we would not have sin <hi>covered,</hi> but <hi>cured:</hi>
we can open our breast to the bullet of the
word, and say, Lord smite this sin.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>When we are thankful for a reproof,</hi>
Psa. 141. 5. Let the righteous smite me, it shall
be a kindness, and let him reprove me, it shall be
an excellent oyl which shall not break my<note n="*" place="margin">Sermo vulnerans dolorem affert sed salutarem. <hi>Molleru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> was glad of a reproof. Suppose a

should shoot the Lyon and save the man,
would not he be thankful? So, when we are
in the mouth of sin, as of a Lyon, and the
Minister by a reproof shoots this sin to death,
shall not we be thankful? A gracious soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth
when the sharp Lance of the word
hath let out his Imposthume; he wears a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
as a Jewel on his ear, <hi>Pro. 30. 12. As
an ear-ring of gold, so is a reprover on an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient

that the godly have more than the influx of

ineffable, and is fitter for some Seraphique
Pen to describe than mine. The Spirit of
God discovers its self in a gracious soul two
wayes.</p>
                  <p>1. By its <hi>motions:</hi> These are some of that
sweet perfume the spirit breaths upon the

which way the tyde of the word runs, that
way the wind of the spirit blows.</p>

in the godly, be distinguished from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulses
of a Natural Conscience?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. A Natural Conscience may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
sometimes to the same thing that the
spirit doth, but not from the same principle.
Natural Conscience is a spu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to duty, but it
puts a man upon doing duties for fear of hell;
as the Gally tugs at the Oar for fear of being
beaten: whereas the spirit moves a Childe
of God from a more Noble Principle; it
makes him serve God <hi>out of choice,</hi> and esteem
duty his priviledge.</p>
                  <p>2. The impulses of a Natural Conscience,
put men only upon more facil duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
wherein the heart is less exercised;
as perfunctory reading, or praying; but the
motions of the spirit in the godly go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
causing them to set upon the most

in the Name of the Lord.</hi> 2. When our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are divinely qualified, we do them with
pure aims. 3. When we have found God
going along with us, we give him the glory
of all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10. This doth clearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
that the duty was carried on by the
strength of Gods Spirit, more than by any
innate abilities of our own.</p>
                  <p>7. Gods Spirit hath a comforting<note n="†" place="margin">Spiritus super mel dulcis, qui vel ipsam mortem suavem reddit. <hi>Bern.</hi>
                     </note> virtue;
disconsolacy may arise in a gracious<note n="*" place="margin">Psa. 43.</note> heart;
as the Heaven, though it be a bright lucid bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
yet hath interposition of Clouds; this
sadness is caused usually through the malice
of Satan, who if he cannot <hi>destroy</hi> us, he
will <hi>disturb</hi> us, but Gods Spirit within us
doth sweetly chear and revive; he is called

                     </gap>, <hi>the Comforter, Ioh.</hi> 14. 16. These
comforts are real and infallible: Hence it is
called <hi>the Seal of the Spirit, Eph.</hi> 1. 13. When
a Deed is sealed, it is firm and unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
so when a Christian hath the seal of the
spirit, his comforts are confirmed; every
godly man hath these revivings of the spirit
<hi>in some degree,</hi> he hath the seminals and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials
of joy, though the flower be not fully
ripe and blown.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> How doth the Spirit give comfort?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. By showing us that we are in a
state of Grace: A Christian cannot always
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:106547:51"/>
see his riches; the work of Grace may be
written in the heart like short-hand, which a
Christian cannot read; the spirit gives him a
<hi>Key</hi> to open these dark Characters, and spell
out his Adoption, whereupon he hath joy
and peace, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 12. We have received the
Spirit which is of God, that we might know the
things which are freely given to us of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The spirit comforts, by giving us some
ravishing apprehensions of Gods love, <hi>Rom.
5. 5. The love of God is shed abroad in our
hearts by the Holy Ghost.</hi> Gods love is a box
of precious oyntment, and it is only the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
can break open this box, and fill us with
the sweet perfume of it.</p>
                  <p>3. The spirit comforts, by carrying us to
the Bloud of Christ; as when a man is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and ready to faint, carry him to the water,
and he is refreshed: so when we are fainting
under the burden of sin, the spirit carries us
to the Fountain of Christs Bloud, <hi>Zac. 12. 1.
In that day there shall be a Fountain opened, &amp;c.</hi>
The spirit inables us to drink the waters of
Justification which run out of Christs sides:
The spirit applyes whatever Christ hath
purchased, it shows us that our sins are done
away in Christ, and though we are spotted in
our selves, we are undefiled in our head.</p>
                  <p>4. The spirit comforts, by inabling Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106547:52"/>
to comfort; the Childe must be
taught before it can speak: The spirit opens
the mouth of Conscience, and helps it to
speak, and witness to a man that his estate is
good, whereupon he begins to receive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<hi>Rom. 9. 2. My Conscience bearing me
witness in the Holy Ghost.</hi> Conscience draws
up a Certificate for a man, then the Holy
Ghost comes and sets his hand to the Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate.</p>
                  <p>5. The spirit conveys the Oyl of Joy
through two Golden Pipes.</p>
                  <p>1. The Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>2. The Promises.</p>
                  <p>1. The <hi>Ordinances:</hi> As Christ in prayer
had his <hi>countenance changed, Luk</hi> 9. 29. There
was a glorious lustre upon his face; so often
in the use of Holy Ordinances, the godly
have such raptures of joy, and soul-transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurations,
that they have been carried above
the world, and despised all things below.</p>
                  <p>2. The <hi>Promises:</hi> The Promises are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable:
1. For their <hi>sureness, Rom.</hi> 4. 16.
God in the Promises hath laid his truth to<note n="*" place="margin">

pawn. 2. For their <hi>suitableness,</hi> being calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
for every Christians condition. The
Promises are like a Physick-garden, there is
no disease but some herb may be found there
to cure it; but the Promises of themselves
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:106547:52"/>
cannot comfort, only the spirit inables us to
suck these Honey-combs: The Promises are
like a Limbeck full of herbs, but this Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck
will not drop, unless the fire be put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
So when the spirit of God (which is
compared to fire) is put to the Limbeck of
the Promises, then they distil Consolation
into the soul. Thus we see how the spirit is
in the godly by its virtues.</p>

4. VVithout the spirit no Ordinance is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
to us; Ordinances are the <hi>Conduit-Pipes</hi>
of Grace, but the spirit is <hi>the Spring:</hi>
Some content themselves that they have a
<hi>Levite to their Priest,</hi> but never look any
further; as if a Merchant should content
himself that his ship hath good tackling, and
is well manned, though it never have a gale of
wind: The Ship of Ordinances will not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
us to heaven, though an Angel were the
Pylot, unless the wind of Gods Spirit blow:
The Spirit is the <hi>Soul</hi> of the Word, without
which it is but a <hi>dead letter:</hi> Ministers may
prescribe Physick, but it is Gods spirit must
make it work: Our hearts are like <hi>Davids</hi>
body, when it grew old, <hi>they covered him
with cloathes, but he gat no heat, 1 King.</hi> 1. 1.
So though the Minister of God ply us with
prayers and counsels as with <hi>hot cloathes,</hi> yet
we are cold and chill till Gods spirit comes,
and then we say as the Disciples, <hi>Luke 24. 32.
Did not our hearts burn within us?</hi> Oh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
what need have we of the spirit?</p>
                  <p>3. You who have the blessed spirit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested

1. Acknowledge Gods distinguishing love;
the spirit is an ear-mark of Election, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi>

Without this Christ would not profit you;
the <hi>Bloud of God</hi> is not enough without the

spirit; this Loadstone will never leave draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>2. If you have this spirit do not grieve it,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 30. Shall we grieve our Comforter?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. When we unkindly repel the
motions of it: The spirit sometimes whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
in our ears, and calls to us as God did to
<hi>Iacob, Gen. 35. 1. Arise, go to Bethel.</hi> So
saith the spirit, Arise, go to prayer, retire
thy self to meet thy God: Now when we
stifle these motions, and entertain temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to vanity, this is a grieving of the spirit;
if we check the <hi>motions</hi> of the spirit, we shall
lose the <hi>comforts</hi> of the spirit.</p>
                  <p>2. We grieve the spirit, when we deny
the work of the spirit in our hearts; if one
gives another a token, and he should deny it,
and say he never received it, this were to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
the love of his friend: So Christian,

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:106547:55"/>
by those meltings of heart, and passionate
breathings after heaven, yet thou deniest
that thou ever hadst any renewing work of
the spirit in thee; this is high ingratitude, and
is a grieving the good spirit; renounce the
sinful works of the flesh, but do not deny
the gracious work of the spirit.</p>

                  <p>2. I distinguish between <hi>outward</hi> humility

between an humble carriage, and an humble

                  <p>3. I distinguish between <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy;</hi>

humble, and consequently godly?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. An humble soul is emptied of
all swelling thoughts of himself: <hi>Bernard</hi>
calls Humility a Self-annihilation, <hi>Iob 22. 29.
Thou wilt save the humble.</hi> In the Hebrew it
is, <hi>Him that is of low</hi>

yet looked upon himself as a worm, <hi>Psal. 22.
6. I am a worm, and no man. Bradford</hi> a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,
yet subscribes himself a sinner, <hi>Iob 10.
15. If I am righteous, I will not lift up my head:</hi>
Like the Violet, a sweet flower, but hangs
down the head.</p>
                  <p>2. An humble soul thinks better of others
than of himself, <hi>Phil. 2. 3. Let each esteem o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
better than</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas est con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptus propriae excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae. <hi>Bern.</hi> de gard. humil.</note> 
                     <hi>themselves.</hi> An humble man
values others at an higher rate than himself;
and the reason is, because he can better see
his own heart than he can anothers; he sees
his own corruption, and thinks sure it is not
so with others, their Graces are not so weak
as his, their corruptions are not so strong;
sure (thinks he) they have better hearts than
I: An humble Christian studies his own <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,</hi>
and anothers <hi>exellencies,</hi> and that
makes him put an higher value upon others
than himself, <hi>Pro. 30. 2. Surely I am more
bruitish than any man.</hi> And <hi>Paul,</hi> though he
were the chief of the Apostles, yet he calls
himself <hi>the least of Saints, Eph.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
                  <p>3. An humble soul hath a low esteem of
his duties; Pride is apt to breed in our holy
things, as the worm breeds in the sweetest
fruit, and forth comes from the most gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:106547:57"/>
wine: An humble person doth not only
deny his <hi>sins,</hi> but his <hi>duties;</hi> when he hath
prayed and wept, alas, saith he, how little
have I done, God might damn me for all
this; he saith as good <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> Chap. 13. 22.
<hi>Remember me O my God concerning this, and
spare me.</hi> Remember Lord how I have pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out my soul, but spare me, and pardon
me; he sees that his best duties weigh many
grains too light, therefore he desires Christs
Merits may be put into the Scales: The
humble Saint blusheth when he looks upon
his Copy, he sees he cannot write even, nor
without blotting; this humbles him to think
that his best duties run dregs; he drops poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
upon his sacrifice: Oh, saith he, I dare
not say I have prayed or wept, those which
I write down for duties, God might write
down for sins.</p>
                  <p>4. An humble man is ever preferring Bills
of Indictment against himself; he complains
not of his <hi>condition,</hi> but his <hi>heart:</hi> O this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
heart of unbelief! Lord (saith <hi>Hooper) I
am hell, but thou art heaven.</hi> An hypocrite is
ever telling how good he is; an humble soul
is ever saying how bad he is: <hi>Paul</hi> that high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown
Saint, who was caught up into the
third heaven, how doth this bird of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise
bemoan himself for his corruptions,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:106547:57"/>
                     <hi>Rom. 7. 24. O wretched man that I am, &amp;c.</hi>
Holy <hi>Bradford</hi> subscribes himself, <hi>the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
sinner:</hi> The more knowledge an
humble Christian hath, the more he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
of ignorance; the more Faith, the
more he bewails his<note n="*" place="margin">Quanto quis plus proficit, eò minus se reputet profecisse. <hi>Bern,</hi> de mod. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand.</note> unbelief.</p>
                  <p>5. An humble man will justifie God in an
afflicted condition, <hi>Nehem. 9. 33. Howbeit thou
art just in all that is brought upon us.</hi> If men
oppress and calumniate, the humble soul ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
Gods righteousness in the midst
of severity, 2 <hi>Sam. 24. 17. Lo, I have sinned:</hi>
Lord, my pride, my barrenness, my Sermon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surfeiting
hath been the procuring cause of
all these judgements; when <hi>Clouds</hi> are round
about God, yet <hi>righteousness is the habitation
of his Throne, Psa.</hi> 97. 2.</p>
                  <p>6. An humble soul is a Christ-Magnifier,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 20. he gives the glory of all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to Christ, and Free-grace: King <hi>Canutus</hi>
took the Crown off his own head, and set it
upon a Crucifix; so an humble Saint takes
the Crown of honour from his own head,
and sets it upon Christs; and the reason is,
from that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> he bears to Christ; Love can

                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> humble Saint loves Christ
intirely, therefore can part with any thing to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:106547:58"/>
him: he gives away the honour and praise of
all he doth to Christ, let Christ wear those
Jewels.</p>
                  <p>7. An humble soul is willing to take a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
for sin; a wicked man is too high to
stoop to a reproof: The Prophet <hi>Micaiah</hi>
used to tell King <hi>Ahab</hi> of his sin, and saith
he, <hi>I hate him, 1 Kin.</hi> 22. 8. Reproof to a
proud man, is like powring water on lime,
which grows the more hot; a gracious soul
loves him that reproves, <hi>Pro. 9. 8. Rebuke a
wise man, and he will love thee.</hi> The humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirited
Christian can bear the reproach of an
Enemy, and the reproof of a friend.</p>
                  <p>8. An humble man is willing to have his
name and parts eclipsed, so Gods glory may
be more encreased; he is content to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shined
by others in gifts and esteem, so that
the Crown of Christ may shine the brighter:
This is the humble mans Motto, <hi>Let me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
let Christ encrease:</hi> 'Tis his desire that
Christ should be exalted, and if this be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
let who will be the instrument, he rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth,
<hi>Phil. 1. 15. Some preach Christ of envy;</hi>
They preached to get away some of <hi>Pauls</hi>
hearers; Well, saith he, <hi>Christ is preached,
and I therein do rejoyce, ver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 8. An humble
Christian is content to be laid aside, if God
hath any other tools to work with which may
bring him more glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:106547:58"/>
9. An humble Saint likes that condition
which God sees best for him; a proud man
murmures he hath no more, an humble man
wonders he hath so much, <hi>Gen. 32. 10. I am
not worthy of the least of all thy mercies:</hi> when
the heart lies low, it can stoop to a low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
A Christian looking upon his sins,
wonders it is no worse with him, he doth not
say his mercies are small, but his sins are
great; he knows the worst piece God carves
him, is better than he deserves, therefore
takes it thankfully upon his knees.</p>
                  <p>10. An humble Christian will stoop to the
meanest person, and the lowest office, he
will visit the poorest member of Christ: <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi>
his sores are more precious to him than
<hi>Dives</hi> purple; he doth not say, <hi>Stand by,
come not neer to me, for I am holier than
thou;</hi> but, <hi>condiscends to men of low estate,
Rom.</hi> 12. 16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. Is Humility the inseparable Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter

But though men are proud, they will not
confess it: This Bastard of Pride is born,
but none are willing to father it; therefore
let me ask a few questions, and let Conscience
answer.</p>

due to God, to themselves, <hi>Dan. 4. 30. Is not
this great Babylon I have built?</hi> So saith the
proud man, are not these the Prayers I have

                  <p>6. Are not they proud who are never

                  <p>Oh let us search if there be none of this
leven of pride in us: Man is Naturally a
proud piece of flesh; this sin runs in a bloud;
our first Parents fell by their Pride, they did
aspire after a Deity; there are the seeds of
this in the best, but the godly do not allow
themselves in it; they labour to kill this
weed by mortification. But certainly where
this sin is regnant and prevailing, it cannot
stand with grace; you may as well call him
a prudent man who wants discretion, as a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man who wants humility.</p>

We must know the Majesty and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

from a broken heart, <hi>Psa. 51. 17. The Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of God are a broken spirit.</hi> The Incense
was to be beaten, to typifie the breaking of
the heart in Prayer: 'Tis not the voluble
tongue, but the melting heart God accepts:
Oh saith a Christian, I cannot pray as others;
as <hi>Moses</hi> said to the Lord, <hi>I am not eloquent:</hi>
But canst thou weep and sigh? Doth thy
soul melt out at thy eyes? God accepts
broken expressions, when they come from
broken hearts. I have read of a Plant that
bears no fruit, but it weeps forth a kind of
Gum which is very costly: So, though thou
dost not flourish with those gifts and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
as others, yet if thou canst weep forth
tears from a contrite heart, these are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

5. A spiritual Prayer is a believing Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<hi>Mat. 21. 22. Whatever ye shall ask in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

so many Prayers suffer shipwrack, is because
they split against the Rock of unbelief;
Praying without Faith, is shooting without

                  </p>
                  <p>6. A Spiritual Prayer is an holy Prayer,
1 <hi>Tim. 2. 8. Wherefore lift up pure hands:</hi>
Prayer must be offered upon the Altar of a
pure heart; sin lived in, makes the heart
hard, and Gods ear deaf; sin stops the mouth
of Prayer, it doth as the Thief to the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller,
puts a Gagg in his mouth, that he
cannot speak; sin poysons and infects pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
A wicked mans prayer is sick of the
Plague, and will God come neer him? The
Loadstone loseth its virtue, when it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread
with Garlick: so doth prayer, when
it is polluted with sin, <hi>Psa 66. 18. If I regard
iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:106547:65"/>
'Tis foolish to pray against sin, and then to
sin against prayer; a spiritual prayer, like
the spirits of Wine, must be refined, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off the Lees and dregs of sin, <hi>Mal. 3. 3.
That they may offer to the Lord an offering in
righteousness:</hi> If the heart be holy, this <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi>
will sanctifie the gift.</p>
                  <p>7. A spiritual prayer is an humble prayer,
<hi>Psa. 10. 17. Lord thou hast heard the desire of
the humble.</hi> Prayer is the asking of an Alms,
which requires humility, <hi>Luke 18. 13. The
Publican standing afar off, would not lift up so
much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon
his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Quanto cum tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, quantâ humilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, accede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re debet à Palude sua repens ranuncula vilis <hi>Bern.</hi> de mod. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randi.</note> 
                     <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
Gods incomprehensible glory may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
amaze us, and strike an holy consterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into us when we approach nigh to him,
<hi>Ezra 9. 6. O my God I blush to lift up my face to
thee:</hi> 'Tis comely to see a poor nothing lye
prostrate at the feet of its Maker, <hi>Gen. 18.
27. Behold, I have taken upon me to speak unto
the Lord, which am but dust and ashes.</hi> The
lower the heart descends, the higher the
prayer ascends.</p>
                  <p>8. A spiritual prayer is when we pray in
the name of Christ: To pray in the name of
Christ, is not only to name Christ in prayer,
but to pray in the hope and confidence of
Christs mediation: as a Childe claims his
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:106547:66"/>
Estate in the right of his Father who purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it, so we come for mercy in Christs
Name, who hath purchased it for us in his
bloud; unless we pray thus, we do not pray
at all, nay, we rather provoke God; as it
was with <hi>Uzziah,</hi> when he would offer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
<hi>without a Priest,</hi> God was angry, and
struck him with Leprosie, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 16. So
when we do not come in Christs Name in
prayer, we offer up Incense without a Priest,
and what can we expect but to meet with
wrath?</p>
                  <p>9. A spiritual prayer is when we pray out
of love to prayer; A wicked man may pray,
but he doth not love prayer, <hi>Iob 27. 10. Will
he delight himself in the Almighty?</hi> A godly
man is carried upon the wings of delight; he
is never so well as when he is praying; he is
not forced with fear, but fired with love, <hi>Isa.
56. 7. I will make them joyful in my house of
prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. A spiritual prayer is, when we have
spiritual ends in prayer: There is a vast diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between a spiritual prayer, and a carnal
desire; the ends of an Hypocrite are secular
and carnal; he looks asquint in prayer; it is
not the sense of his spiritual wants that moves
him, but rather lust, <hi>Iam. 4. 3. Ye ask amiss,
that ye may consume it upon your lusts.</hi> The sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:106547:66"/>
prays more for food than Grace; this
God doth not interpret praying, but howling,
<hi>Hosea 7. 14. They howled upon their beds, they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
for corn and wine.</hi>
                     <q>—Da modo lucra mihi.—<note place="margin">Ovid.</note>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prayers which want a good aim, want a
good answer: A godly man hath spiritual
ends in prayer; he sends out his prayer, as a
Merchant sends out his Ship, that he may
have large returns of spiritual blessings; his
design in prayer is, that his heart may be
more holy, and that he may have more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God: A godly man drives the
Trade of prayer, that he may encrease the
stock of Grace.</p>
                  <p>11. A spiritual prayer is accompanied
with the use of means; there must be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> as
well as <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: When <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was sick, he
did not only pray for recovery, but he laid <hi>a
lump of figs</hi> to the boyl, <hi>Isa.</hi> 38. 21. Thus it
is in case of the soul, when we pray against
sin, and avoid temptations; when we pray
for Grace, and improve opportunities, this is
the laying a fig to the boil, which wil make us
recover: To pray for holiness, and neglect
the means, is like winding up the Clock, and
pulling off the weights.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:106547:67"/>
12. A spiritual prayer is that which leaves
a spiritual frame behind upon the heart; a
Christian is better after prayer, he hath
gotten more strength over sin, as a man by
exercise gets strength: The heart after
prayer keeps a tincture of holiness, as the
Vessel savours and relisheth of the Wine that
is put into it. <hi>Moses</hi> having been with God
on the Mount, his face shined; so having
been on the Mount of prayer, our Graces
shine, and our lives shine: This is the sign of
a godly man, he prays in the spirit: This is
the right kind of praying; the gift of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is ordinary, like Culinary fire; but spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
prayer is more rare and excellent, like
Elementary fire which comes from heaven.</p>

                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. Is a godly man of a praying spirit?<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note>
then this excludes them from being godly,</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Who pray not at all:</hi> Their houses are
unhallowed houses; 'tis made the note of a
Reprobate, <hi>he calls not upon God, Psal.</hi> 14. 4.
Doth that indigent creature think to have an
Alms who never asks it? Do they think to
have mercy from God who never seek it?
Truly then God should befriend them more
than he did his own Son; <hi>he offered up pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and supplications with strong cryes, Heb.</hi> 5. 7.
None of Gods Children are tongue tyed,
<hi>Gal. 4. 6. Because ye are sons, God hath sent
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:106547:67"/>
forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying
Abba Father.</hi> Creatures by the instinct of
Nature cry to God, <hi>Psal. 147. 9. The young
Ravens which cry: Psal. 104. 21. The Lyons
seek their meat from God:</hi> Not to cry to God,
is worse than bruitish.</p>
                  <p>2. Others pray, but it is <hi>seldome;</hi> like that
prophane Atheist <hi>Heylin</hi> speaks of, who told
God he was no common begger, he never
troubled him before, and if he would hear
him now, he would never trouble him again.</p>
                  <p>3. Others pray, but not <hi>in the Holy Ghost,
Iude</hi> 20. They are rather <hi>Parrots,</hi> than <hi>weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Doves;</hi> their hearts do not melt in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
they exercise their invention more then
their affection.</p>

pray at least twice a day: In the Temple
there was the Morning and Evening Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:
<hi>Daniel</hi> prayed three times a day; nay,
so did he love prayer, that he would not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
prayer to save his life, <hi>Dan. 6. 10. Luther</hi>
spent three hours every day in prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But what needs prayer, when God
hath made so many promises of blessings?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Prayer is the condition annexed to
the Promise: Promises turn upon the hinge
of prayer, <hi>Ezek. 36. 37. I will yet for this be
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:106547:68"/>
enquired of by the house of Israel.</hi> A King
promiseth a pardon, but it must be sued out.
<hi>David</hi> had a promise that God would build
him an house, but he sues out the promise by
prayer, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 25. Christ himself had all
the promises made sure to him, yet he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and spent whole nights in prayer.</p>
                  <p>Therefore if you would be counted god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
be given to<note n="*" place="margin">Deus nunquam frustra quaeritur, imò ne tunc cum inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niri non potest. <hi>Bernard.</hi>

                     <hi>Prayer:</hi> Prayer sanctifies
your mercies, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5. prayer weeds out
sin, and waters Grace.</p>
                  <p>That I may encourage Christians, and
hold up their heads in prayer, as <hi>Aaron</hi> and
<hi>Hur</hi> held up <hi>Moses</hi> hands, let me propound
these few considerations.</p>
                  <p>1. Prayer is a seed sown in Gods ears; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
seed sown in the ground may be picked
up by the Birds, but this seed (especially if
watred with tears) is too precious to be
lost.</p>
                  <p>2. Consider the power of prayer: The
Apostle having set down the whole Armour
of a Christian, brings in prayer as the chief
part, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 18. Without this (saith <hi>Zanchy)</hi>
all the rest are little<note n="†" place="margin">Reliqua arma Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunt. <hi>Zanch.</hi>
                     </note> worth: By prayer
<hi>Moses</hi> divided the Red Sea; <hi>Ioshua</hi> stop'd
the course of the Sun, and made it stand
still, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 10. 13. Nay, prayer made the
Sun of Righteousness stand still, <hi>Luke 18. 40.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:106547:68"/>
And Iesus stood still.</hi> Prayer is the in-let to
all blessings, spiritual and temporal. When
<hi>Aurelius Antonius</hi> went against the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
he had in his Army a Regiment of
Christians, who upon their earnest prayer,
obtained Rain for the refreshment of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
and because of the power of their
prayers, he called them <hi>the Thundering Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Prayer hath a power in it to destroy
the insolent Enemies of the Church. We
read, <hi>the two Witnesses</hi> have a flame <hi>at their

but leaves him bound.</p>
                  <p>3, Jesus Christ prays over our prayers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
he takes the dross out, and presents
nothing but pure gold to his Father. Christ
mingles his sweet odours with the prayers of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:106547:69"/>
the Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 8. Think of the dignity of
his person, he is <hi>God;</hi> and the sweetness of
his Relation, he is a <hi>Son:</hi> Oh then what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
is here for us to pray! Our
prayers are put in the hand of a Mediator;
though as they come from us they are weak
and imperfect, yet as they come from Christ,
they are mighty and powerful.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>The sweet promises which God hath
made to prayer,</hi> Isa. 30. 19. He will be very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
unto thee at the voice of thy cry, Ier. 29. 13,
14. Then shall ye go and pray unto me, and I will
hearken unto you; and ye shall seek me, and find
me, when ye shall search for me with all your
heart. <hi>And</hi> Isaiah 65. 24. Before they call, I
will answer, and while they are yet speaking, I
will hear. <hi>These promises keep the head of
prayer above water; God is bound with his
own promises, as</hi> Sampson <hi>was bound with his
own hair.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us then double our files, and with our

signifies <hi>sine plicis,</hi> without pleats and folds:
A godly man is plain-hearted, having no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
subterfuges; Religion is the Livery a
godly man wears, and this Livery is lined
with Sincerity.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The godly man is that which he
seems to be; he is a <hi>Iew inwardly, Rom.</hi> 2.
29. Grace runs through his heart, as silver
through the veins of the earth: The hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
is not what he seems.

                  </p>
                  <p>A picture is like a man, but it wants breath:
The Hypocrite is an Effigies, a picture, he
doth not breathe forth Sanctity; he is but
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:106547:70"/>
like an Angel on a Sign-post: A godly man
answers to his profession, as the Transcript to
the Original.</p>
                  <p>2. The godly man labours to approve
himself to God in every thing, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 9.
We labour that whether present or absent, we may
be accepted of him.</hi> 'Tis better to have God
<hi>approve,</hi> than the world <hi>applaud:</hi> They that
did run in the Olympick Race, laboured to
have his approbation, who was the Judge
and Umpire of the Race: There is a time
shortly coming, when a smile from Gods face
will be infinitely better than all the applauses
of men: How sweet will that word be, <hi>Euge
bone serve, Well done thou good and faithful
servant, Mat.</hi> 25. 21. A godly man is ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
of Gods Letters-Testimonial; the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
desires to carry it fair with men: <hi>Saul</hi>
was for the vogue of the people, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.
30. A godly man approves his heart to God,
who is both the Spectator and the Judge.</p>
                  <p>3. The godly man is ingenuous in laying
open of his sins, <hi>Psa. 32. 5. 1 confessed my sin
to thee, and my iniquity have I not hid.</hi> The
hypocrite doth vail and smother his sin; he
doth not <hi>abscindere peccatum,</hi> but <hi>abscondere;</hi>
like a Patient that hath some loathsome dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
in his body, he will rather die than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
his disease: But a godly mans sincerity
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:106547:70"/>
is seen in this, he will confess and shame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for sin, 2 <hi>Sam. 24. 17. Lo I have sinned,
and I have done wickedly:</hi> Nay, a Childe of
God will confess sin <hi>in particular;</hi> an unsound
Christian will confess sin <hi>by wholesale,</hi> he will
acknowledge he is a sinner in general; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<hi>David</hi> doth as it were point with his finger
to the sore, <hi>Psal. 51. 4. I have done this evil:</hi>
He doth not say, I have done evil, but <hi>this
evil;</hi> he points at his bloud-guiltiness.</p>
                  <p>4. The godly man hath blessed designs
in all he doth; he propounds this end in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Ordinance, that he may have more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with God, and bring more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to God; as the herb Heliotropium turns
about according to the motion of the Sun;
so a godly mans actions do all move towards
the glory of God: It is an axiom in Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
<hi>The means are in order to the</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Media sunt appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenda propter fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</note> 
                     <hi>end.</hi> A
godly mans praying and worshipping is, that
he may honor God; though he shoots short,
yet he takes a right aim; the hypocrite
minds nothing but self-interest, the sails of
his Mill move not, but when the wind of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
blows; he never dives into the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Sanctuary,</hi> but to fetch up a piece
of gold at the bottom.</p>
                  <p>5. The godly man abhors dissimulation
towards men, his heart goes along with
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:106547:71"/>
his<note n="*" place="margin">Homo sine fuco. <hi>Erasm.</hi>
                     </note> tongue, he cannot flatter and<note n="†" place="margin">Psa. 28. 3.</note> hate,
commend and censure, <hi>Rom. 12. 9. Let love
be without dissimulation.</hi> Dissembled love is
worse than hatred; counterfeiting of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is no better than <hi>a</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Psa. 78. 36.</note> 
                     <hi>lye,</hi> for there is a
pretence of that which is not: Many are like
<hi>Ioab, 2 Sam. 20. 9. He took</hi> Amasa <hi>by the
beard to kiss him, and smote him with his sword
in the fifth rib, and he</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Mel in ore, fel in corde.</note> 
                     <hi>died.</hi>
                     <q>—Impia sub dulci melle venena latent.—</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a River in <hi>Spain,</hi> where the fish
seem to be of a golden colour, but take
them out of the water, and they are like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fish: All is not gold that glisters; there
are some pretend much kindness, but they
are like great veins which have little bloud;
if you lean upon them, they are as a Leg out
of joynt: For my part I much question his
truth towards God, that will flatter and lie to
his friend, <hi>Pro. 10. 18. He that hideth hatred
with lying lips is a fool.</hi> By all that hath been
said, we may try whether we have this note
of a godly man, to be sincere.</p>
                  <p>Sincerity (as I conceive) is not properly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

grace, but rather the ingredient into every
grace: Sincerity is that which doth qualifie
grace, and without which grace is not true,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:106547:71"/>
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. ult. <hi>Grace be with them, which love our
Lord Iesus Christ in sincerity:</hi> Sincerity qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies
our love; sincerity is to grace, as the
bloud and spirits are to the body; there can
be no life without the bloud, so no grace
without sincerity.</p>

<hi>Noah found grace in Gods eyes:</hi> Why, what
did God see in <hi>Noah?</hi> he was girt with the

and when God sees a sincere heart, he sees
his own Image, and he cannot chuse but fall
in love with it, <hi>Pro. 11. 20. He that is upright
in his way, is Gods delight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Sincerity makes our services find accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with God; the Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi>
had but <hi>a little</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">

                     <hi>strength;</hi> her grace was
weak, her services slender, yet of all the
Churches Christ wrote to, he found the
least fault with her: What was the reason?
because she was most sincere, <hi>Rev. 3. 8. Thou
hast kept fast my word, and hast not denied my
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:106547:72"/>
Name.</hi> Though we cannot pay God all we
owe, yet a little in currant Coyn is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
God takes sincerity for full payment: A
little gold, though rusty, is better than Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimy
be it never so bright; a little sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
though rusted over with many infirmities,
is of more value with God, than all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
flourishes of hypocrites.</p>
                  <p>3. Sincerity is our safety; false hearts
that will step out of Gods way, and use car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
policy, when they think to be most safe,
they are least secure; he that walketh <hi>pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
walketh <hi>surely, Pro.</hi> 10. 9. A sincere
Christian will do nothing but what the word
warrants, and that is safe, as to the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
Nay, oftentimes such as are upright
in their way, the Lord takes care of their
outward safety, <hi>Psal. 4. I laid me down and
slept. David</hi> was now beleaguer'd with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
yet God did so incamp about him by
his Providence, that he could sleep securely
as in a Garrison: Ver. 5. <hi>The Lord sustained
me:</hi> The only way to be safe, is to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</p>
                  <p>4. Sincerity is Gospel perfection, <hi>Iob 1.
8. Hast thou considered my servant</hi> Job, <hi>that
there is none like him in the earth, a perfect, and
an upright man.</hi> Though a Christian be full
of infirmities, and like a Childe that is put
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:106547:72"/>
out to Nurse, weak and feeble, yet God
looks upon him, as if he were compleatly
righteous: Every true Saint hath the
<hi>Thummim</hi> of perfection upon his breast-plate.</p>
                  <p>5. Sincerity is that which the Devil strikes
most at: Satans spite was not so much at
<hi>Iobs</hi> Estate, as his integrity; he would have
wrested the Shield of Sincerity from him,
but <hi>Iob</hi> held that fast, <hi>Iob</hi> 27. 6. A Thief
doth not fight for an empty purse, but for
money: The devil would have robbed <hi>Iob</hi>
of the Jewel of a good Conscience, and
then he had been poor <hi>Iob</hi> indeed: Satan
doth not oppose <hi>Profession,</hi> but <hi>Sincerity:</hi>
Let men go to Church, and make glorious
pretences of holiness, Satan doth not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
this; this doth him no hurt, nor them
no good; but if men will be sincerely pious,
then Satan musters up all his forces against
them: Now that which the Devil doth most
assault, we must labour most to maintain:
Sincerity is our Fort-Royal, where our chief
treasure lies; this Fort is most shot at, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us be more careful to preserve it:
While a man keeps his Castle, his Castle will
keep him: While we keep Sincerity, Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
will keep us.</p>
                  <p>6. Sincerity is the beauty of a Christian,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:106547:73"/>
wherein lies the beauty of a Diamond, but
in this, that it is a true Diamond? If it be
counterfeit, it is worth nothing: So wherein
lies the beauty of a Christian, but in this,
that he hath <hi>truth in the inward</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Psa. 51. 6</note> 
                     <hi>parts:</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
is a Christians Ensign of glory; 'tis
both his Breast-plate to defend him, and his
Crown to adorn him.</p>
                  <p>7. The vileness of hypocrisie: The Lord
would have no <hi>leven</hi> offered up in Sacrifice;
leven did typifie hypocrisie, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 1. The

                        </gap> unto you
Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye devoure
Widows houses, and for a pretence, make long
prayers:</hi> Who would think they were guilty
of Extortion, that would pray so many
hours together? Who would suspect him
of false weights, that hath the Bible so often
in his hand? Who would think he would
slander, that seems to fear an oath? Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
are the worst sort of sinners, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
infinite dishonor upon Religion; hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie
for the most part ends in scandal, and
that brings an evil report upon the ways of
God; one man breaking, makes such as are
honest suspected; one scandalous hypocrite,
makes the world suspect that all Professors
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:106547:73"/>
are so; the hypocrite was born to do Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a spite, and to bring it into an odium.</p>
                  <p>The hypocrite is a lyer, he worships God
with his knee, and his lusts with his heart;
like those 2 <hi>Kin. 17. 33. They feared the Lord,
and served their own gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The hypocrite is an impudent sinner, he
knows his heart is false, yet he goes on: <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
knew himself to be an hypocrite; he asks,
<hi>Master is it I?</hi> Christ replies, <hi>Thou hast said
it?</hi> Yet so shameless was he as to persist in
his falseness, and betray Christ: All the
plagues and curses written in the Book of
God, are the hypocrites portion, Hell is
his place of Randezvous, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 51. Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
are the chief guests the Devil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects,
and he will make them as welcome, as
fire and brimstone can make them.</p>
                  <p>8. If the heart be sincere, God will wink
at many failings, <hi>Numb. 23. 21. He hath not
seen iniquity in Iacob.</hi> Gods love doth not
make him blind, he can see infirmities, but
how? not with an eye of revenge, but pitty,
as a Physitian sees a disease in his Patient to
heal him: God doth not see iniquity in <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
so as to destroy him, but to heal him, <hi>Isa.
57. 18. He went on frowardly, I have seen his
ways, and I will heal him:</hi> How much pride,
vanity, passion, doth the Lord pass by in his
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:106547:74"/>
sincere ones! He sees the integrity, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
the infirmity: How much did God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlook
in <hi>Asa!</hi> the <hi>high-places were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved:</hi>
Yet it is said, 2 <hi>Chron. 15. 17. The
heart of</hi> Asa <hi>was perfect all his days.</hi> We e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
of a picture, though it be not drawn at
the full length: So though the graces of Gods
people are not drawn at their full length,
nay, have many scars and spots, yet having
something of God in sincerity, they shall
find mercy; God loves the sincere, and 'tis
the nature of love to <hi>cover</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Pro. 12. 10.</note> infirmity.</p>
                  <p>9. Nothing but sincerity will give us
comfort in an houre of trouble: King <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>
thought he had been dying, yet this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
him, that Conscience drew up a Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate
for him, <hi>Isa. 38. 2. Remember O Lord,
how I have walked before thee in truth, &amp;c.</hi>
Sincerity was the best flower of his Crown:
What a golden Shield will this be against
Satan, when he shall roar upon us by his
temptations, and set our sins before us on
our Death-bed, then we shall answer, 'Tis
true Satan, these have been our miscarriages,
but we have bewailed them; if we have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
it was against the bent and purpose of
our heart; this will stop the Devils mouth,
and put him to a retreat; therefore labour
for this Jewel of Sincerity, 1 <hi>Ioh. 3. 24. If
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106547:74"/>
our heart condemn us not, then we have confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
towards God:</hi> If we are cleared at the
<hi>Petty Sessions</hi> in our own Conscience, then we
may be confident, we shall be acquitted at the
Great <hi>Assizes</hi> at the day of Judgement.</p>

1. A godly man is heavenly in his <hi>Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
he chuseth heavenly objects: <hi>David</hi> did
chuse to be a Residentiary in Gods house,
<hi>Psa.</hi> 84. 10. A godly person chuseth Christ
and grace, before the most illustrious things
under the Sun: <hi>That a man is that his choice
is;</hi> and this chusing of God is best seen in a
critical houre: When Christ and the World
come in competition, and we part with the
world to keep Christ and a good Conscience,
a sign we have chosen <hi>the better</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>2. A godly man is heavenly in his <hi>Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
he sets his <hi>affections</hi> on things above,
<hi>Col.</hi> 3. 2. He sends his heart to heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he comes there; he looks upon the
world, but as a beautiful prison, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be much in love with his Fetters, though
they are made of gold: An holy person
contemplates glory and Eternity; his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires
have gotten wings, and are fled to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
Grace is in the heart like fire, which
makes it sparkle upwards in Divine brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
and ejaculations.</p>
                  <p>3. A godly man is heavenly in his <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
his words are powdred with <hi>salt</hi> to
season others, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 6. As soon as Christ
was risen from the grave, he was <hi>speaking of
the things pertaining to the Kingdome of God,
Act.</hi> 1. 3. No sooner is a man risen out of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:106547:75"/>
the grave of Unregeneracy, but he is
speaking of heaven, <hi>Eccles. 10. 12. The words
of a wise mans mouth are gracious:</hi> He speaks
so heavenly, as if he had been already in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
the love he bears to God, will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him to be silent; the Spouse being <hi>sick of
love,</hi> her tongue was as the <hi>pen</hi> of a ready
writer, <hi>Cant. 5. 10. My beloved is white and
ruddy, his head is of fine gold, &amp;c.</hi> If Wine
be in the house, the Bush will be hung forth,
and where there is a principle of godliness in
the heart, it will vent it self at the lips; the
Bush will be hung forth.</p>
                  <p>How can they be termed godly, 1. Who are
possessed with a <hi>dumb devil?</hi> They never
have any good discourse; they are fluent and
discoursive enough in secular things; they
can speak of their wares and drugs, they can
tell what a good crop they have, but in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion they are as if their tongue
did cleave to the roof of their mouth:
There are many persons, if you come into
their company, you cannot tell what to make
of them, whether they are Turks or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists,
for they never speak a word of
Christ.</p>
                  <p>2. Whose tongues <hi>are set on fire of Hell:</hi>
Their lips do not drop honey but poyson, to
the defiling of others. <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith, speech
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:106547:76"/>
ought to be like gold, which is then of most
value, when it hath least dross in it: O the
unclean malicious words that some persons
utter! What an unsavoury stench comes
from these dunghils; those lips had need have
<hi>Davids</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Psa. 39. 1</note> 
                     <hi>Bridle,</hi> that gallop so fast in sin:
Can the body be healthful when the tongue
is black? Can the heart be holy when the
devil is in the lips? A godly man speaks <hi>the
language of Canaan, Mal. 3. 16. They that
feared the Lord, spake often one to another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. A godly man is heavenly in his <hi>Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
The motions of the Planets are Caele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial:
A godly man is sublime and sacred in
his motions, <hi>he works out salvation,</hi> he puts
forth all his strength, as they did in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympicks,
that he may obtain the Garland
made of the Flowers of Paradise; he prays,
fasts, watcheth, he offers violence to heaven,
he is divinely acted, he carries on Gods Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in the world, he doth Angels work, he
is in his Operations Seraphical.</p>
                  <p>5. A godly man is heavenly in his <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation;</hi>
his hopes are above the<note n="†" place="margin">Psa. 39. 7</note> world,
<hi>Tit. 1. 2. In hope of eternal life:</hi> A godly
man casts Anchor <hi>within the</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Viget spei immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. <hi>Cypr.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>vail;</hi> he hopes
to have his fetters of sin filed off; he hopes
for such things <hi>as eye hath not seen;</hi> he hopes
for a Kingdome when he dies; a Kingdome
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:106547:76"/>
promised by the Father, purchased by the
Son, assured by the Holy Ghost; as an Heir
lives in hope when such a great Estate shall
befall him, so a Childe of God, who is a
<hi>Co-heir with Christ,</hi> hopes for glory: This
hope comforts him in all varieties of conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Rom. 5. 2. We rejoyce in the hope of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. This hope comforts a godly man in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction;
hope doth lighten and sweeten the
most severe Dispensations: A Childe of
God can laugh with tears in his eyes; the
time is shortly coming, when the Cross shall
be taken off his shoulders, and a Crown set
upon his head: A Saint at present is misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
with a thousand troubles, in an instant,
cloathed with Robes of Immortality, and
advanced above Seraphims.</p>
                  <p>2. This hope comforts a godly man in
death, <hi>Pro. 14. 32. The righteous hath hope in
his death:</hi> If one should ask a dying Saint,
when all his earthly comforts were gone,
what he had left? he would say, <hi>the Helmet
of Hope.</hi> I have read of a Martyr Woman,
who when the Persecutor commanded that
her breasts should be cut off, she said, Tyrant
do thy worst, I have two breasts which thou
canst not touch, the one of <hi>Faith,</hi> the other
of <hi>Hope.</hi> A soul that hath this blessed
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:106547:77"/>
hope, is above the desire of life, or the fear
of death: Would one be troubled to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
a sorry Lease for an Inheritance that
will be for him and his Heirs? Who would
care to part with life, which is a Lease will
soon be run out, to be possessed of a glorious
Inheritance in light?</p>
                  <p>6. A godly man is heavenly in his <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation;</hi>
he casts such a lustre of Holiness, as
adorns his Profession; he lives as if he had
seen the Lord with bodily eyes; what zeal,
sanctity, humility, shines forth in his life: A
godly person doth emulate not only the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
but imitate Christ himself, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 6.
The <hi>Macedonians</hi> celebrate the Birth-day of
<hi>Alexander,</hi> on which day they wear his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
about their necks, set with Pearl and
rich Jewels; so a godly man carries the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
picture of Christ about him, in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venliness
of his deportment, <hi>Phil. 3. 20.
Our conversation is in heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. They must needs be cast over the
Bar for ungodly,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> who are eaten up with the
world; godly and earthly is a contradiction,
<hi>Phil. 3. 18, 19. For many walk, of whom I
now tell you even weeping, that they are the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of the Cross of Christ, whose god is their
belly, who mind earthly things.</hi> We read the
earth swallowed up <hi>Korah</hi> alive, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 32.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:106547:77"/>
This Judgement is on many, the earth swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
up their time, and thoughts, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
they are buried twice; their hearts
are buried in the earth before their bodies:
How sad is it that the soul, that Princely
thing, which is made for Communion with
God and Angels, should be put to the Mill to
grinde, and made <hi>Mancipium terrae,</hi> a slave
to the earth? How is the soul become like
the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> chusing rather to converse with
<hi>swine,</hi> and feed upon <hi>husks,</hi> than to aspire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Communion with the blessed Deity?
Thus doth Satan befool men, and keep them
from heaven, by making them seek an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> As we would evidence our selves
to be <hi>born of God,</hi> let us be of a sublime
heavenly temper:<note place="margin">Exhort.</note> We shall never go to
heaven when we die, unless we are in heaven
whilest we live: That we may be more No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and raised in our affections, let us serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
weigh these four considerations.</p>
                  <p>1. God himself sounds a retreat to us, to
call us off the world, 1 <hi>Iohn 2. 15. Love not
the world:</hi> We may use it as a posie of flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to smell to, but it must not lie as <hi>a bundle
of myrrhe</hi> betwixt our breasts, <hi>Rom. 12. 2. Be
ye not conformed to this world;</hi> do not hunt
after the honors and profits of it, and as
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:106547:78"/>
Gods <hi>Precepts,</hi> so his <hi>Providences,</hi> are to beat
us off the world: Why doth he send War
and Pestilence? <hi>What means the heat of this
great anger?</hi> Surely dying times are to make
men die to the world.</p>
                  <p>2. Consider how much below a Christian
it is to be earthly-minded: We laugh some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
at Children when we see them busying
themselves about toys, blowing bubbles in
the ayr out of a shell, kissing their Babies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
when in the mean time we do the same; at
death what will all the world be which we so
hug and kiss, but as a Baby of Clouts, it will
yield us no more comfort then; and to be
taken up with these things, how far is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
an heaven-born soul! nay, for such as
profess to be enobled with a principle of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and to have their hopes above, for them
to have their hearts below, how do they
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> disparage their <hi>Heavenly Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and spot their silver wings of Grace,
by beliming them with earth?</p>
                  <p>3. Consider what a poor contemptible
thing the world is, it is not worth setting the
affections on, it cannot fill the heart; if Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
should take a Christian up to the Mount
of Temptation, and show him all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
and glory of the world, what could
he show him but a phancy, an apparition?
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:106547:78"/>
Nothing here can be proportionable to the
immense soul of man, <hi>Iob 20. 22. In the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his sufficiency he shall be in streights:</hi>
Here is want in plenty; the creature will no
more fill the soul, than a drop will fill the
bucket; and that little sweet we suck from
the creature, is intermixed with some bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
like that Cup which the Jews gave
Christ, <hi>Mar. 15. 23. They gave him to drink
wine mingled with myrrhe.</hi> And this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
sweet will not last long, 1 <hi>Iohn 2. 17.
The world passeth away.</hi> The creature doth but
salute us, and is presently upon the<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

The world rings Changes, it is never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
but in its disappointments; how quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
may we remove our lodgings, and make
our pillow in the dust? The world is but a
great <hi>Inne,</hi> where we are to stay a night or
two, and be gone; what madness is it so to
set our heart upon our Inne, as to forget our
home?</p>
                  <p>4. Consider what a glorious place heaven
is: We read of an <hi>Angel</hi> coming down from
heaven, who <hi>did tread with his right foot on the
Sea, and with his left foot on the earth, Revel.</hi>
10. 2. Had we but once been in heaven,
and viewed the superlative glory of it, how
might we in an holy scorn trample with one
foot upon the earth, and with the other foot
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:106547:79"/>
upon the Sea: Heaven is called a <hi>better</hi>
Country, <hi>Heb. 11. 16. But now they desire a
better Country, that is an heavenly:</hi> Heaven is
said to be a better Country, in opposition to
the Country where we now sojourn: What
should we mind but that better<note n="*" place="margin">Sistitur appetitus in via sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatur in Patria.</note> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> In what sense is heaven a better
Country?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. In that Country above there are
better <hi>delights;</hi> there is <hi>the Tree of Life,</hi> the
<hi>Rivers of Pleasure;</hi> there is amazing beauty,
unsearchable riches; there are the delights
of Angels; there is the Flower of Joy fully
blown; there is <hi>more than we can ask or</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Eph. 3. 20.</note>
                     <hi>think;</hi> there is glory in its full dimensions,
and beyond all hyperbole.</p>
                  <p>2. In that Country there is a better <hi>dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
house:</hi> 1. It is an house <hi>not made with
hands, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 1. To denote the excellency
of it: There was never any house but was
made with hands; but the house above sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth
the art of man or Angel, none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
God could lay a stone in that building.
2. It is <hi>eternal in the heavens;</hi> it is not a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing
house, but a Mansion-house, it is
an house will never be out of repair, <hi>Wisdome
hath built this house, and hewn out her seven</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Pro. 8. 1.</note>
                     <hi>Pillars,</hi> which can never moulder.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:106547:79"/>
3. In that Country there are better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
in our Fathers house <hi>is bread enough:</hi>
Heaven was typified by <hi>Canaan,</hi> which did
flow with milk and honey: There is <hi>the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Feast,</hi> the spiced Wine, there is Angels
food, there are those rare viands and dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
served in, as exceed not only our expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
but our faith.</p>
                  <p>4. In that Country is better <hi>Society:</hi> There
is God blessed for ever: How infinitely
sweet and ravishing will a smile of his face
be? the Kings presence makes the Court:
There are the glorious Cherubims; in this
terrestrial Country where we now live, we
are among Wolves and Serpents; in that
Country above, we shall be among Angels:
There are <hi>the spirits of just men made perfect,
Heb.</hi> 12. 23. Here the people of God are
clouded with infirmities, we see them with
spots in their faces, they are full of pride,
passion, censoriousness; in that <hi>Hierusalem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,</hi>
we shall see them in their Royal attire,
deck'd with unparallell'd beauty, not having
the least tincture or shadow of sin upon
them.</p>
                  <p>5. In that Country there is a better <hi>ayr</hi> to
breathe in: We go into the Country for
ayr; the best ayr is only to be had in that
<hi>better Country,</hi> 1. It is a more temperate ayr,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:106547:80"/>
the Climate is calm and moderate, we shall
neither freeze with the cold, nor faint with
the heat; 2. It is a brighter ayr, there is a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
light shines there: The <hi>Sun of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
enlightens that Horison with his glorious
beams, <hi>Rev. 21. 23. The Lamb is the light
thereof.</hi> 3. It is a purer ayr: The Fens,
which are full of black vapours, we count a
bad ayr, and unwholesome to live in: This
world is a place of Bogs and Fens, where the
noxious vapours of sin arise, which make it
pestilential and unwholesome to live in, but
in that Country above, there are none of
these vapours, but a sweet perfume of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
there is the smell of the Orange-tree,
and the Pomgranate; there is the <hi>Myrrhe</hi>
and <hi>Cassia</hi> coming from Christ, which send
forth a most odoriferous smell.</p>
                  <p>6. In that Country there is a better <hi>soil;</hi>
the Land or Soil is better</p>
                  <p>1. For its <hi>altitude;</hi> the earth lying low,
is of a baser pedigree; the Element, which
is neerest heaven, is purer and more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
as the fire; that Country above is the
<hi>High Country, Psal.</hi> 24. 3. it is seated far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all the visible Orbs.</p>
                  <p>2. It is a better Land for its <hi>fertilness,</hi> it
bear a richer Crop: The richest Harvest on
earth is the golden Harvest, but the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:106547:80"/>
above yields Nobier Commodities, there
are Pearls Caelestial, there is the Spiritual
Vine, there is the honey-comb of Gods
love dropping, there is the Water of Life,
the hidden Manna; there is fruit that doth
not rot, flowers that never fade; there is a
Crop which cannot be quite reaped, it will
be ever reaping time in heaven, and all this
the Land yields, without the labour of
ploughing and sowing.</p>
                  <p>3. It is a better Land for its <hi>inoffensiveness:</hi>
There are no bryars there; the World is a
Wilderness where are wicked men, and <hi>the
best of them is a bryar, Mica</hi> 7. 4. They will
be tearing the people of God in their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Liberties; but in the Country above
there is not one bryar to be seen, all the
bryars are burned.</p>
                  <p>4. It is a better Land for the rareness of
the <hi>prospect;</hi> all that a man sees there is his
own: I account that the best prospect, where
a man can see furthest on his own ground.</p>
                  <p>7. In that Country is better <hi>union;</hi> all the
Inhabitants are knit together in love: The
poysonful weed of malice doth not grow
there; there is harmony without division,
and charity without envy: In that Country
above, as in <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, no noyse of
Hammer is heard.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:106547:81"/>
8. In that Country is better imployment;
while we are here we are complaining of our
wants, weeping over our sins, but there we
shall be praising God: How will the Birds
of Paradise chirp when they are in that Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Country? There the <hi>Morning Stars</hi>
will sing together, and all the Saints of God
shout for joy.</p>
                  <p>O what should we aspire after, but this
Country above? Such as have their eyes
opened, will see that it doth infinitely excel:
An ignorant man looks upon a Star, and it
appears to him as a little silver spot; but the
Astronomer who hath his Instrument to
judge of the dimension of a Star, knows it
to be many degrees bigger than the earth:
So a natural man hears of the heavenly
Country, that it is very glorious, but it is at
a great distance; and because he hath not a
spirit of discerning, the world looks bigger
in his eye; but such as are Spiritual Artists,
who have the Instrument of Faith to judge
of Heaven, will say, it is far the better
Country, and thither will they hasten with
the Sails of desire.</p>

                  <p>15. A godly man is a zealous man; grace
turns a Saint into a Seraphim,<note place="margin">Char. 15.</note> it makes him
burn in holy zeal; zeal is a mixed affection,
a compound of love and anger, it carries
forth our love to God, and anger against sin
in the most intense manner: Zeal is the flame
of the affections; a godly man hath a double
baptism, of <hi>water</hi> and <hi>fire,</hi> he is baptized with
a spirit of zeal, hee is zealous for Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
truth, worship, <hi>Psal. 119. 139. my zeal
hath consumed me;</hi> it was a crown set on <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi>
his head, hee was <hi>zealous for his God.
Numb. 25. 13. Moses</hi> being touched with a
coal from Gods altar, in his zeal hee breaks
the Tables, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 19. our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
in his zeal, whips the buyers and sellers
out of the Temple, <hi>Ioh. 2. 17. the zeal of thy
house hath eaten me up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there is a <hi>Praeternatural heat,</hi> something
looking like zeal, which is not, a Comet looks
like a Star: I shall therefore show some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
between a true and a false zeal.</p>
                  <p>1 A false zeal is a blinde zeal, <hi>Rom. 10. 2.
They have a zeal of God, but not according to
knowledge;</hi> this is not the fire of the spirit,
but wild-fire. The <hi>Athenians</hi> were very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:106547:82"/>
and zealous, but they knew not for
what, <hi>Acts 17. 23. I found an Altar with this
Inscription, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, To the unknown God,</hi>
Thus the Papists are zealous in their way,
but they have taken away <hi>the key of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2 A false zeal is a self-seeking zeal; <hi>Iehu</hi>
cries, <hi>come see my zeal for the Lord, 2 King.</hi>
10. 16. but it was not zeal, but ambition,
he was fishing for a Crown. <hi>Demetrius</hi> pleads
for the Goddess <hi>Diana,</hi> but it was not her
Temple, but her Silver shrines he was zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for: Such zealots <hi>Ignatius</hi> complains of
in his time, that they made a Trade of Christ
and Religion, thereby to enrich<note n="*" place="margin">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Ignat</note> themselves.
'Tis probable many in King <hi>Henry</hi> the eights
time were forward to pull down the Abbies,
not out of any zeal against Popery, but that
they might build their own houses upon the
ruines of those Abbies; like Eagles which
fly aloft, but their eyes are down upon their
prey: If blind zeal be punished seven fold,
hypocritical zeal shall bee punished seventy
and seven fold.</p>
                  <p>3 A false praeposterous zeal, is a misguided
zeal; it runs out most in things which are
not commanded, It is the sign of an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
to be zealous for traditions, and careless
of institutions. The Pharisees were more
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:106547:82"/>
zealous about washing of their <hi>cups</hi> than
their <hi>hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4 A false zeal is fired with passion. <hi>Iames</hi>
and <hi>Iohn,</hi> when they would call for fire from
heaven, were rebuked by our Saviour, <hi>Luk.
9. 54. Yee know not what spirit yee are off,</hi> it
was not zeal, but choller; many have espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the cause of Religion, rather out of facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and humour, than out of zeal to the
truth.</p>
                  <p>But the zeal of a godly man, is a true and
holy zeal, which evidenceth it self in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of it.</p>
                  <p>1 True zeal cannot bear an injury done to
God, zeal makes the blood rise, when Gods
honour is impeached, <hi>Rev. 2. 2. I know thy
works and thy labour and patience, and how thou
canst not bear them which are evil;</hi> hee who
zealously affects his friend, cannot hear him
spoken against, and be silent.</p>
                  <p>2 True zeal will encounter with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
difficulties; when the world holds out a
<hi>Gorgons</hi> head of danger to discourage us,
zeal casts out fear; it is quickned by<note n="*" place="margin">Marcet sine adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sario vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. <hi>Sen. de provid.</hi>
                     </note> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.
Zeal doth not say <hi>there is a Lyon in the
way;</hi> zeal will charge through an Army of
dangers, it will march in the face of death. Let
news be brought to <hi>Paul,</hi> that he was way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid,
<hi>in every City bonds and imprisonment did
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:106547:83"/>
abide him,</hi> this sets a keener edge upon his
zeal, <hi>Acts 21. 13. I am ready not only to bee
bound, but to dye for the name of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus:</hi>
as sharp frosts do by an antiparistasis
make the fire burn hotter, so sharp oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
do but inflame zeal the more.</p>
                  <p>3 True zeal as it hath knowledge to go
before it, so it hath sanctity to follow after
it: Wisdome leads the van of zeal, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
brings up the rear: an hypocrite seems
to be zealous, but he is vitious: the godly
man is <hi>white</hi> and <hi>ruddy,</hi> white in purity, as
well as ruddy in zeal; Christs zeal was hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the fire, and his holiness purer than
the sun.</p>
                  <p>4 Zeal that is genuine loves truth when it
is despised, and opposed, <hi>Psal. 119. 126.
They have made void thy law, therefore I love
thy commandements above gold:</hi> the more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
deride holiness, the more we love it;
what is Religion the worse for others disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
it? doth a Diamond sparkle the less, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
a blinde man disparageth it? the
more outragious the wicked are against the
truth, the more couragious the godly are for
it: When <hi>Mical</hi> scoffed at <hi>Davids</hi> religious
dancing before the Ark, if (saith he) this be
to be vile, <hi>I will yet be more vile, 2 Sam.</hi> 6.
22.</p>

                     <hi>spirit:</hi> Zeal makes
us hear with reverence, pray with affection,
love with ardency. God kindled <hi>Moses</hi> his
sacrifice from heaven, <hi>Lev. 9. 24. There
came a fire out from before the Lord, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
upon the Altar the burnt offering:</hi> when
we are zealous in devotion, and our heart
waxeth hot within us, here is a fire from
heaven kindling our sacrifice: how odious is
it for a man to be all fire when he is sinning,

                     </gap>e when he is praying: A pious
heart, like water seething hot, boils over in
holy affections.</p>
                  <p>6. True zeal is never out of breath;
though it be <hi>violent,</hi> 'tis <hi>perpetual;</hi> no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
can quench the flame of zeal, it is tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
in the frigid zone: The heat of zeal is
like the natural heat coming from the heart,
which lasts as long as life: That zeal which
is not constant, was never true.</p>

                     <hi>Use</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> How opposite are they to godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
who cry down zeal,<note place="margin">1 Bran.</note> and count it a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
phrensie? They are for the light of
knowledge, but not for the heat of zeal.
When <hi>Basil</hi> was earnest in preaching against
the Arrian Heresie, it was interpreted folly
and dotage. Religion is a matter requires
zeal; the Kingdom of heaven will not be taken
but by <hi>violence, Mat.</hi> 12. 11.</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> But why so much fervour in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
what becomes then of Prudence?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Though Prudence be to <hi>direct</hi> zeal,
yet not to <hi>destroy</hi> it; because sight is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site,

If Prudence be the eye in Religion, zeal is the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Though moderation in things of
indifferency be commendable, and doubtless
it would much tend to the setling the peace
of the Church; yet in the main Articles of
Faith, wherein Gods glory and our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

else but sinful neutrality: It was <hi>Calvins</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

if the Apostle had said, avenge not your

                  <p>2 What strangers are they to godliness,<note place="margin">2 Bran.</note>
who have no zeal for the glory of God?
they can see his ordinances despised, his
worship adulterated, yet their spirits are not
at all stirred in them. How many are of a
dull, lukewarm temper, zealous for their
own secular interest, but have no zeal for
the things of heaven; hot in their own
cause, but cool in Gods. The Lord doth
most abominate lukewarm professours, I had
almost said, hee is sick of them, <hi>Rev. 3. 15.
I would thou wert cold or hot,</hi> (any thing but
lukewarm) <hi>but because thou art neither cold
nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth:</hi> A
lukewarm Christian is but dough-baked, just
like <hi>Ephraim, Hos. 7. 8. Ephraim is a cake
not turned:</hi> To keep up a form of Religion
without zeal, is to be like those bodies the
Angels assumed, which mooved, but had
no life in them. I would ask these Tepid
neutral professors this question, If Religion
be not a good cause, why did they undertake
it at first? if it be, why do they go so faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
about it? why have they no more holy
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:106547:85"/>
ardours of soul? these persons would fain go
to heaven in a soft bed, but are loath to bee
carried thither in a fiery Chariot of zeal. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
God will be zealous against them,
who are not zealous; he provides the fire of
hell, for those that want the fire of zeal.</p>

                  <p>Why should not we wait patiently upon
God. 1. We are servants; it becomes ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants

regard of <hi>God;</hi> when we bear his hand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

But, patience is a cheerful submission of our

1. <hi>Disquiet of spirit:</hi> When the soul is

that it is unfit for holy duties; when

himself, as if he had not deserved what
he suffers: A proud sinner stands upon his

                  <p>2. When God imposeth any evil upon us.</p>

comfort from us:</hi> Doth God take away any
of our Relations? <hi>Ezek. 24. 16. I will take

it is our duty patiently to acquiesce in the
Will of God: The loss of a dear Relation,

                  <p>But grace will make our hearts calm and
sedate, and work us to an holy patience under
such a severe dispensation. I shall lay down
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:106547:88"/>
eight considerations, which may be as spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Physick to kill the worm of impatience
under the loss of Relations.</p>
                  <p>1. The Lord never takes away any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
from his people, but he gives them that
which is better: The Disciples parted with
Christs corporal presence, and he sent them
the Holy Ghost: God eclipseth one joy, and
augments another, he doth but make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
he takes away a Flower, and gives a
Diamond.</p>
                  <p>2. Godly friends dying are in a better
condition, they are taken away <hi>from the evil
to come, Isa.</hi> 57. 1. They are out of the storm,
and are gotten to the Haven, <hi>Blessed are the
dead that die in the Lord, Rev.</hi> 14. 13. The
godly have a portion promised them upon
their marriage with Christ, but the portion
is not paid till the day of their death: The
Saints at death are preferred to Communion
with God, they have that they so long hoped
for, and prayed for; why then should we be
impatient at our friends preferment?</p>
                  <p>3. Thou that art a Saint, hast a friend in
heaven which thou canst not lose: The Jews
have a saying at their<note n="†" place="margin">Sit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solatio tua in caelis.</note> Funerals, <hi>Let thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
be in heaven.</hi> Art thou a close Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
look up to heaven, and fetch comfort
thence, thy best kindred are above, <hi>Psa 27. 10,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:106547:88"/>
When my Father and Mother forsake me, then
the Lord will take me up:</hi> God will be with
thee in the hour of death, <hi>Psa. 23. 4. Though
I walk in the valley of the shadow of death, thou
art with me.</hi> Other friends thou canst not
keep, God is a friend thou canst not lose; he
will be thy Guide in life, thy Hope in death,
thy Reward after death.</p>
                  <p>4 Perhaps God is correcting thee for a
fault, and it so, it becomes thee to bee pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;
it may bee thy friend had more of thy
love than God, and therefore God did take
away such a relation, that the stream of thy
love may run bak to him again. A gracious
woman having been deprived, first of her
Children, then of her Husband, Lord (saith
she) thou hast a plot upon me, thou intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to have all my love; God doth not like it,
to have any Creature set upon the throne of
our affections, hee will take away that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and then he shall lye nearest our heart.
If an Husband bestow a jewel upon his
Wife, and she doth so fall in love with that
jewel, as to forget her Husband, hee will
take away the jewel, that her love may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to him again; a dear relation is this jewel,
if we begin to idolize it, God will take away
the jewell, that our love may return to him

shall meet together in heaven, and be in each
others embraces? when a great prince lands

heavenly shore, and shall congratulate one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers

there be? what musick in the quire of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels?
how will heaven ring of their praises?
and that which is the crown of all, they who
were here joyned in the flesh, shall bee joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

and shall lye together in Christs<note n="†" place="margin">1 Thes. 4. 17.</note> bosome,

                  <p>6 Wee have deserved worse at Gods
hands; hath hee taken away a childe, a wife,

sea of sin, and but a drop of suffering.</p>
                  <p>7 The patient soul doth most sweetly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy

upon the wrack of his own griefs and
passions, whereas patience calms the heart,

                  <p>8 How patient have many of the Saints
been, when the Lord hath broken the very
staff of their comfort, in berea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are heart-quieting considerations, when God
sets a deaths-head upon our comforts, and
removes dear relations from us.</p>

evil upon us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 12. Patient in Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>1 The Lord sometimes laies <hi>heavy</hi> afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                     </note> afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
signifies to bee melted; God seems to
melt his people in a furnace.</p>
                  <p>2 God doth sometimes lay <hi>divers</hi> afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on the Saints, <hi>Iob 19. 17. Hee multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth
my wounds:</hi> as wee have divers waies of
sinning, so the Lord hath divers waies of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting;
some hee melts away their estates,
others hee chains to a sick bed, others hee
confines to a Prison; God hath various ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
in his quiver, which he shoots.</p>
                  <p>3 Sometimes God lets the affliction <hi>lye
long, Psal. 74. 9. There is no more any Prophet,
neither is there among us any that knoweth how
long:</hi> As it is with diseases, there are some
<hi>Chronical,</hi> that linger and hang about the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:106547:90"/>
several years together, so it is with affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
the Lord is pleased to exercise many
of his precious ones with <hi>Chronical afflictions,</hi>
such as lye upon them a long time; now in all
these cases, it becomes the Saints, patiently
to rest in the will of God; the Greek word
for<note n="†" place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> 
                     <hi>patient,</hi> is a metaphor, alludes to one
who stands invincibly under a burden. This
is the right notion of patience, when we bear
affliction invincibly without fainting, or fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
                  <p>The trial of a Pilot is seen in a storm; so is
the tryal of a Christian seen in affliction; hee
hath the right art of navigation, who when
the boistrous winds blow from heaven, doth
steer the ship of his soul wisely, and not dash
upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rock of impatience; a Christian
should alwaies keep a decorum, not behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself unseemly, or disguising himself
with intemperate passion, when the hand of
God lies upon him. Patience adorns suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
affliction in Scripture is compared to a
net, <hi>Psa. 66. 11. Thou broughtest us into the net.</hi>
Such as have escaped the Devils net, yet the
Lord suffers them to bee taken in the net of
affliction, but they must not be <hi>as a wild Bull
in a net, Isa.</hi> 51. 20. to kick and fling against
their maker, but lye patiently till God break
the net, and makes away for their escape.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:106547:91"/>
I shall propound four cogent Arguments, to
excite patience under those evils which God
inflicts on us.</p>

waters of <hi>Bethesda</hi> could not give health of

till Gods Spirit co-operates and sanctifies
them to us: Afflictions are many ways<note n="†" place="margin">Quod mundus noxium es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se putat, exitum u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilem pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>Calv.</hi>

                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:106547:91"/>
2 Afflictions are a friend to grace.</p>
                  <p>1 They <hi>beget</hi> grace; <hi>Beza</hi> acknowledged

are beholding to their troubles, they had
never had so much grace, if they had not
met with such sore trials; now, the waters
run, and the spices flow forth. The Saints
thrive by affliction, as the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>
grew rich by war; God makes grace flourish
most in the fall of the leaf.</p>
                  <p>3 Afflictions quicken our pace in the way
to heaven; it is with us, as with children sent
on an errand, if they meet with Apples or
Flowers by the way, they linger and make
no great haste home, but if any thing fright
them, then they run with all the speed they
can to their fathers house; so in prosperity,
we are gathering the Apples and Flowers,
and do not much minde heaven, but if trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
begin to arise, and the times grow fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
then we make more haste to heaven, and

                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> How shall I get my heart tuned into a

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1 Get faith; all our impatience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from unbelief; faith is the breeder of
patience, when a storm of passion begins to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise,
faith saith to the heart, as Christ to the
Sea, <hi>peace, be still,</hi> and there is presently a calm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> How doth faith work patience?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Faith argues the soul into patience;
faith is like that <hi>Town-Clark</hi> in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> who
allayed the contention of the multitude, and
argued them soberly into peace, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 35,
36. So when impatience begins to clamour
and make an hubbub in the soul; faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaseth
the tumult, and argues the soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
holy patience: Saith faith, <hi>Why art thou
disquieted O my Soul?</hi> art thou afflicted? is
it not thy Father hath done it? he is carving
and pollishing thee, and making thee fit for
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:106547:93"/>
glory, he smites that hee may save; what is
thy tryal, is it sickness? God shakes the
Tree of thy body, that some fruit may fall,
even <hi>the peaceable fruit of righteousness, Heb.</hi>
12. 11. Art thou driven from thy habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
God hath prepared for thee a City,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 16. Dost thou suffer reproach for
Christs sake? <hi>a spirit of God and glory rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee, 1 Pet.</hi> 4. 14. Thus faith argues and
disputes the soul into patience.</p>
                  <p>2 Pray to God for patience, patience is
a flower of Gods planting; pray that it may
grow in your heart, and send forth its sweet
perfume: Prayer is an holy charm, to charm
down the <hi>evil spirit;</hi> prayer composeth the
heart, and puts it in Tune, when impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
hath broken the strings, and put all into
a confusion: Oh go to God, prayer delights
Gods ear, it melts his heart, it opens his
hand; God cannot deny a praying soul; seek
to him with importunity, and either he will
remove the affliction, or which is better, he
will remove thy impatience.</p>

1. Take a Christian at the worst, yet hee is
thankful: The Prophet <hi>Ionah,</hi> who was

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a man of a waspish spirit; the
sea did not so work with the tempest,<note n="*" place="margin">Jon. 1. 13.</note> as
<hi>Ionahs</hi> heart wrought with passion; yet,
through this cloud you might see grace ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear;
he had a thankful heart, <hi>Ionah 2. 9.
I will Sacrifice to thee with the voice of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
I will pay that which I have vowed.</hi>
For the clearer illustrating of this, I shall lay
down these four particulars.</p>
                  <p>1 <hi>Praise and thanksgiving is a Saint-like
work; we finde in Scripture, the godly are
still called upon to praise God,</hi> Psa. 135. 20.
Ye that fear the Lord, bless the Lord. Psa. 149.
5. Let the Saints bee joyful in glory, let the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:106547:94"/>
high praises of God be in their mouth; <hi>praise is a
work proper to a Saint.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1 None but the godly can praise God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right;
as all have not skill to play on the Lute,
so every one cannot sound forth the harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
praises of God; wicked men are <hi>bound</hi> to
praise God, but they are not <hi>fit</hi> to praise him;
none but a living Christian can tune Gods
praise; wicked men are <hi>dead in sin,</hi> how can
they lift up Gods praises, that are dead?
<hi>Isa. 38. 19. The grave cannot praise thee:</hi> A
wicked man stains and eclipseth Gods praise,
if a foul hand work in Damask, or flowred Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,
it will slur the beauty of it; God will
say to the sinner, <hi>what hast thou to do, to take
my name into thy mouth? Psa.</hi> 50. 16.</p>
                  <p>2 Praise is not comely for any, but the
godly, <hi>Psa. 33. 1. Praise is comely for the
righteous:</hi> A prophane man stuck with Gods
praises, is like a dunghill stuck with flowers;
praise in the mouth of a sinner, is like an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
in the mouth of a fool; how uncomely
is it for him to praise God, whose whole
life is a dishonouring of God? it is as unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
for a wicked man to praise God, as it is
for an Usurer to talk of living by faith, or for
the Devil to quote Scripture; the godly on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are fit to be queristers in Gods praises, 'tis
called <hi>the Garment of praise, Isaiah</hi> 61. 3.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:106547:94"/>
this garment sits handsome only on a Saints
back.</p>
                  <p>2 Thanksgiving is a more noble part of
Gods worship; our wants may send us to
prayer, but it argues an heart highly ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to bless God; the Raven cries, the Lark
sings; in petition we act like men, in thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
we act like Angels.</p>
                  <p>3 Thanksgiving is a God-exalting work,
<hi>Psa. 50. 23. Whoso offereth praise, glorifieth
me,</hi> though nothing can adde the least cubit
to Gods essential glory, yet praise exalts
him in the eyes of others; praise is a setting
forth of Gods honour, a lifting up of his name,
a displaying the trophy of his goodness, a
proclaiming his excellency, a spreading his
renown, a breaking open the box of oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whereby the sweet savour and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume
of Gods name is sent abroad into the
world.</p>
                  <p>4 Praise is a more distinguishing work;
by this a Christian excels all the infernall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
dost thou talk of God? so can the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
hee brought Scripture to Christ; dost
thou profess religion? so can the Devil,
he <hi>transforms himself into an Angel of light;</hi>
dost thou fast? he never eats; dost thou
beleeve? the Devils have a faith of assent,
they <hi>believe and tremble, Iam.</hi> 2. 19. but, as
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:106547:95"/>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> wrought such a miracle, as none of
the Magicians could do the like; so here is
a work Christians may be doing, which none
of the Devils can do, and that is the work
of thanksgiving; they blaspheme, but do
not bless; Satan hath his <hi>fiery darts,</hi> but not
his harp and viol.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1 See here the true genius and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion

praises bee sounded, but in his Temples? a
good heart is never weary of praising God,
<hi>Psa. 34. 1. His praise shall continually bee in my

to send the tenth of their yearly revenue to
<hi>Hercules,</hi> but by degrees they grew weary,
and left off<note n="*" place="margin">Diodor. Siculus.</note> sending. <hi>David</hi> as long as hee
drew his breath, would chirp forth Gods
praise, <hi>Psa. 146. 2. I will sing praises to my God,
while I have any being: David</hi> would not
now and then give God a fit of Musick, and
then the instrument must be hung up, but he
would continually be celebrating Gods praise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:106547:95"/>
A godly man will express his thankfulness
in every <hi>duty,</hi> hee mingles thanksgiving with
prayer, <hi>Phil. 4. 6. In every thing by prayer,
with thanksgiving, let your requests bee made
known to God.</hi> Thanksgiving is the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
part of prayer; in our petitions wee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
our own necessities, in our thanksgivings
we declare Gods excellencies. <hi>Then</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

that hee is drawn nearer to God,
though it be by the cords of affliction; when
it goes well with him, hee praiseth Gods
mercy; when it goes ill with him, he magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
Gods justice; when God hath a rod in
his hand, a godly man will have a Psalm in his
mouth. The Devils smiting of <hi>Iob,</hi> was
like the striking upon a musical instrument,
he sounded forth praise, <hi>The Lord hath taken
away, blessed be the name of the Lord, Iob</hi> 1.
21. Gods spiritual plants, when they are cut

Tears cannot drown their praises.</p>

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:106547:96"/>
the number of the godly will appear to bee
very small. Few are in the work of praise,
sinners cut God short of his thank-offering,

Gods mercy, 1 <hi>Chron. 16. 4. David appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

say, the memory is the first thing that<note n="†" place="margin">Memori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

'tis true in spirituals, <hi>Psal. 106. 13.
They soon forgat his works:</hi> A godly man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
down his mercies, as a Physician his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts
into a book, that they may not bee lost.
Mercies are Jewels that should be locked up;
A childe of God keeps two books alwaies by
him, one to write his sins in, that he may be
humble, the other to write his mercies in, that
he may be thankful.</p>
                  <p>2 Then wee are rightly thankful, when
our hearts are the chief instrument in the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick

                     <hi>heart. David</hi> would
not only put his Viol in tune, but his heart;
if the heart doth not joyn with the tongue,
there can bee no consort; where the heart is
wanting, the Parrot is as good a Querister,
as the Christian.</p>
                  <p>3 Then we are rightly thankful, when the
favours which we receive, endear our love
to God the more. <hi>Davids</hi> miraculous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:106547:97"/>
from death, drew forth his love to
God, <hi>Psa. 116. 1. I love the Lord,</hi> it is one
thing to love our mercies, another thing to
love the Lord; many love their <hi>deliverance,</hi>
but not their <hi>deliverer;</hi> God is to bee loved
more than his mercies.</p>
                  <p>4 Then we are rightly thankful, when in
giving our praise to God, wee take all wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness
from our selves, <hi>Gen. 32. 10. I am
not worthy of the least of all the mercies, thou
hast shewed unto thy servant;</hi> as if <hi>Iacob</hi> had
said, Lord the worst bit thou carvest me, is
better than I deserve. 2 <hi>Sam. 9. 7. Mephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bosheth
bowed himself, and said, what is thy

when he takes a survey of his blessings, and
sees how much he enjoyes, that others bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than he want, Lord saith he, what am I,
<hi>a dead dog,</hi> that free-grace should look upon
me, and that thou shouldst crown mee with
such loving kindness?</p>
                  <p>5 Then we are rightly thankful, when we
put Gods mercies out of Use; wee turn our
<hi>injoyments</hi> into <hi>improvements;</hi> the Lord
gives us health, and wee <hi>spend and are spent
for Christ, 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 15. hee gives us an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
and wee <hi>honour the Lord with our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
Prov.</hi> 3. 9. he gives us children, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:106547:97"/>
wee dedicate them to God, and edugate
them <hi>for</hi> God; wee do not bury our Talents,
but trade them, this is to put out our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
to Use: a gracious heart is like a peece
of good ground, that having received the
seed of mercy, thrusts forth a crop of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>6 Then wee are rightly thankful, when
we can have our hearts more enlarged for spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
mercies, than for temporal: <hi>Eph. 1. 3.
Blessed be God, who hath blessed us with all spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
blessings:</hi> A godly man blesseth God
more for a fruitful heart, than a full crop; hee
is more thankful for Christ, than for a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
<hi>Socrates</hi> was wont to say, hee loved
the Kings smile more than his gold: a pious
heart is more thankful for a smile of Gods
face, than hee would bee for the gold of the

                  </p>
                  <p>7 Then wee are rightly thankful, when

to make it run faster. <hi>David</hi> wisely argues

8 Then wee are rightly thankful, when
we excite others to this Angelical work of
praise: <hi>David</hi> would not only bless God
himself, but calls upon others to do so,
<hi>Praise ye the Lord, Psalm.</hi> 111. 1. That is the
sweetest musick, which is in consort; when
many Saints joyn together in consort, then
they make heaven ring of their praises; as
one drunkard will bee calling upon another,
so in an holy sense, one Christian must bee
stirring up another to the work of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>9 Then we are rightly thankful, when we
do not only speak Gods praise, but live his
praise: It is called <hi>gratiarum actio,</hi> then wee
give thanks, when wee live thanks; such as
are mirrours of mercy, should be patterns of
piety, <hi>Obad. 17. Upon Mount Sion, shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance,
and there shall be holiness:</hi> To give
God orall praise, and dishonour him in our
lives, is to commit a barbarism in religion,
and is to be like those <hi>Iews</hi> who bowed the
knee to Christ, and then did spit upon him,
<hi>Mark</hi> 15. 19.</p>
                  <p>10 Then wee are rightly thankful, when
wee do propagate Gods praises to posterity,
we tell our children what God hath done for
us, in such a want hee supplyed us, in such a
sickness he raised us, in such a temptation he
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:106547:98"/>
succoured us: <hi>Psa. 44. 1. O God our Fathers
have told us, what work thou didst in their daies,
in the time of old.</hi> By transmitting our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences
to our Children, Gods name is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized,
and his mercies will bring forth a
plentiful crop of praise when wee are gone.
<hi>He man</hi> puts the question, <hi>Psal. 88. 10. Shall
the dead praise thee?</hi> Yes, in this sense, when
we are dead, we praise God, because having
left the Chronicle of Gods mercies with our
Children, we put them upon thankfulness,
and so make Gods praises live, when we are
dead.

praise, our stock of grace increseth: in other
debts, the more we pay, the less wee have,
but the more wee pay this debt of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the more grace wee have.</p>
                  <p>2 Thankfulness is the quit-rent wee owe
to God, <hi>Psa. 148. 11, 13. King of the earth,

                  <p>2 That which may put a string more into
the instrument of our praise, and make it
sound louder, is to consider what <hi>spiritual

                  <p>Four Sacrifices God is much pleased with,
the sacrifice of Christs blood, the sacrifice

most excellent part of Gods worship, for

                  <p>6 What an horrid thing ingratitude is, it
gives a dye and tincture to every other sin,
and makes it <hi>Crimson;</hi> ingratitude is the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of baseness, <hi>Obad. v. 7. They that eat thy
bread, have laid a Wound under thee:</hi> Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
is worse than bruitish, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 3. 'Tis
reported of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
forgive an ungrateful person; though God
be a sin-pardoning God, he scarce knows not
how to pardon for this, <hi>Ier. 5. 7. How shall I
pardon thee for this, thy children have forsaken
me, when I had fed them to the full, they then
committed adultery. Draco</hi> (whose Laws were
written in blood) published and edict, that
if any man had received a benefit from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and it could bee proved against him,
that hee had not been grateful for it, hee
should be put to death; an unthankful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is a monster in nature, a Pardox in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity;
he is the scorn of heaven, and the
plague of earth; an ungrateful man, never
doth well but in one thing, that is when hee
dies.</p>
                  <p>7 The not being thankful, is the cause of
all the Judgements which have lain upon us;
our unthankfulness for health, hath been the
cause of so much Mortality; our Gospel-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:106547:101"/>
thankfulness, and Sermon-surfeiting, hath
been the reason why God hath put so many
Lights <hi>under a Bushel;</hi> as <hi>Bradford</hi> said, my
unthankfulness was the death of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the sixth: Who will bestow cost on a

but briars? unthankfulness stops the golden
Vial of Gods bounty, that it will not drop.</p>

                     <hi>Quest.</hi> How shall we do to be thankful?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If you would be thankful, get
an heart deeply humbled in the sense of your
own vileness; a broken heart is the best pipe
to sound forth Gods praise; hee who studies
his sins, wonders that he hath any thing, and
that God should shine upon such a dunghill,
1 <hi>Tim. 1. 13. Who was before a Blasphemer, and
a Persecuter, but I obtained mercy:</hi> How thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
was he? how did he Trumpet forth free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace?
A proud man will never bee thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
he looks upon all his mercies, to bee ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his own procuring or deserving; if
he hath an Estate, this he hath gotten by his
wit and industry, not considering that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Deut. 8. 18. Thou shalt remember the
Lord thy God, for it is he that gives thee power to
get Riches.</hi> Pride stops the Current of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
O Christian! think of thy unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
see thy self, the least of Saints, and the
chief of Sinners, and then thou wilt be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>

a man godly, must have seven ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
in it.</p>
                  <p>1 Love to the Saints must bee sincere,
1 <hi>Ioh. 3. 18. Let us not love in word or in
tongue, but in deed and in truth:</hi> The hony
that drops from the comb is pure, so must
love be pure without deceit: Many are like
<hi>Naphtali, Gen. 49. 21. he giveth goodly words:</hi>
Pretended love is like a painted fire, which
hath no heat in it. Some hide malice under a
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:106547:102"/>
false veil of love; I have read of <hi>Antoninus</hi> the
Emperour, where he made a shew of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
there he intended the most mischief.</p>
                  <p>2 Love to the Saints must be spiritual, we
must love them because they are Saints; not
out of self-respects, because they are affable,
or have been kinde to<note n="*" place="margin">Ollaris amor, qui tamdiù fervet qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diù olla fervida est.</note> us,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Hesh.
but we must love them under a spiritual no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
because of the good that is in them;
we are to reverence their holiness, else it is
a carnal love.</p>
                  <p>3 Love to the Saints must be extensive,
we must love all that bear Gods<note n="*" place="margin">A quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ad om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne valet consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</note> image.</p>
                  <p>1 Though they have many infirmities; a
Christian in this life, is like a good face full
of Freckles; thou that canst not love ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
because of his imperfections, didst never
yet see thy own face in the glass; thy brothers
infirmities may make thee pity him, his
graces must make thee love him.</p>
                  <p>2 Wee must love the Saints, though in
some things they do not coalesce and agree
with us: another Christian may differ from
me in less matters, either because hee hath
more light than I, or because hee hath lesse
light; if he differs from me, because he hath
more light, then I have no reason to censure
him; if because hee hath less light, than I
ought to bear with him, as the weaker Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:106547:103"/>
in things of an indifferent nature, there
ought to be Christian connivance.</p>
                  <p>3 We must love the Saints, though their
graces out-vye and surpass ours; we ought
to bless God for the eminency of anothers
grace, because hereby religion is honoured;
Pride is not quite slain in a believer; Saints
themselves are apt to grudge and repine at
each others excellencies; is it not strange,
that the same person, should hate one man
for his sin, and envy another for his vertue?
Christians had need look to their hearts;
then is love right and genuine, when we can
rejoyce in the graces of others, though they
seem to eclipse ours.</p>
                  <p>4 Love to the Saints must be appretiating,
we must esteem their persons above others,
<hi>Psa. 15. 4. He honours them that fear the Lord:</hi>
we are to look upon the wicked as lumber,
but upon the Saints as jewels, these must bee
had in high veneration.</p>
                  <p>5 Love to the Saints must bee Social,
wee should delight in their company, <hi>Psal.
119. 63. I am a companion of all them that
fear thee.</hi> 'Tis a kind of hell to be in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of the wicked, where we cannot choose
but hear Gods name dishonoured: It was a
capital crime, to have carried the Image of
<hi>Tiberius,</hi> engraven upon a Ring or Coyn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:106547:103"/>
of God engraven upon them, should
not go into any sinful fordid company. Never
but two that I read of, who were living, did
desire to keep company with the dead, and
they were possessed with the<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 8. 28.</note> Devil: what
comfort can a living Christian have, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with the dead? <hi>Iude</hi> 2. but the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of Saints is eligible; this is not to walk

are Christs garden, their graces are the

smell of these flowers.</p>
                  <p>6 Love to the Saints must be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;

love to them; vindicate their names, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute

                     <hi>continue:</hi> as love must bee sincere

that censuring and despising, that reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

are bitter spirits; a sign <hi>iniquity abounds,</hi>
because the love of many waxeth cold;
there is that distance among some professours,
as if they had not received the same spirit, or
as if they did not hope for the same heaven:
In the Primitive times, there was so much
love among the godly, as set the heathens a

The Devil hath knowledge, but that which

To perswade Christians to love, consider,</p>
                  <p>1 The Saints have that in them, which
may make us love them; they are the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
embroidery and workmanship of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ghost, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10. they have those rare
lineaments of grace, as none but a pensil from
heaven could draw; their eyes sparkle forth
beauty, <hi>Cant. 4 9. their breasts are like clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of grapes, Cant</hi> 7. 7. This makes Christ
himself delight in his spouse: <hi>The King is
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:106547:105"/>
held in the galleries.</hi> The Church is <hi>the
daughter of a Prince, Cant.</hi> 7. 1. she is waited
on by Angels, <hi>Heb: 1. ult.</hi> she hath a Pallace
of glory reserved for her, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 2. and
may not all this draw forth our love?</p>
                  <p>2 Consider how evil it is for the Saints
not to love.</p>
                  <p>1 It is <hi>Unnatural,</hi> the Saints are Christs
<hi>Lambs, Ioh.</hi> 21. 15. for a dog to worry a
Lamb is usual, but for one Lamb to worry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
is unnatural: The Saints are <hi>brethren,
1 Pet.</hi> 3. 8. how barbarous is it for brethren
not to love?</p>
                  <p>2 Not to love is a <hi>foolish</hi> thing; have not
Gods people enemies enough, that they
should flye in the faces one of another? the
wicked confederate against the godly, <hi>Psal.
83. 3. They have taken crafty counsel against
thy people:</hi> though there may fall out a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
grudge betwixt such as are wicked, yet
they will all agree and unite against the
Saints: if two Gray-hounds are snarling at a
bone, yet, put up an Hare between them,
and they will leave the bone, and follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Hare; so if wicked men have private
differences amongst themselves, yet if the
godly be near them, they will leave snar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
at one another, and will pursue after the
godly; now, when Gods people have so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:106547:105"/>
enemies abroad, who watch for their halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and are glad when they can do them a
mischief; shall the Saints fall out, and divide
into parties among themselves?</p>
                  <p>3 Not to love is very <hi>unseasonable;</hi> Gods
people are in a common calamity, they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in one cause, and for them to disagree,
is altogether unseasonable; why doth the
Lord bring his people together in <hi>affliction,</hi>
but to bring them together in <hi>affection?</hi>
Mettals will unite in a furnace, if ever Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
unite, it should bee in the furnace of
affliction. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> compares affliction to
a shepherds Dog, which makes all the sheep
run together: Gods Rod hath this loud
voice in it, <hi>Love one another;</hi> how unworthy
is it when Christians are suffering together,
to be then striving together.</p>
                  <p>4 Not to love is very <hi>Sinful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1 For Saints not to love, is to live in a
contradiction to Scripture; the Apostle is
continually beating upon this string of love,
as if it made the sweetest musick in Religion,
<hi>Rom. 13. 8. Col. 3. 14. 1 Pet. 1. 22. 1 Ioh.
3. 11. 1 Iohn 4. 21. This Commandement we
have from him, that hee who loveth God, love
his Brother also:</hi> not to love, is to walk Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes
to the word; can he be a good Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
who goes against the rules of Physick?
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:106547:106"/>
can he be a good Christian, who goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the rules of Religion?</p>
                  <p>2 Want of love among Christians, doth
much silence the spirit of prayer: hot passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
make cold prayers; where animosities
and contentions prevail, instead of praying
one <hi>for</hi> another, Christians will be ready to
pray one <hi>against</hi> another; like the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
who prayed for fire from heaven
upon the <hi>Samaritans, Luke.</hi> 9. 54. and
will God, think you, hear such prayers as
come from a wrathful heart: will hee eat of
<hi>our leavened bread?</hi> will hee accept of those
duties, which are sowered with bitterness
of spirit? shall that prayer ever go up as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,
which is offered with the <hi>strange fire</hi> of
our sinful passions?</p>
                  <p>3 These heart-burnings, hinder the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
of piety in our own souls; the flower of
grace, will not grow in a wrathful heart;
the body may as well thrive while it hath the
Plague, as a soul can, that is infected with
malice: while Christians are <hi>debating,</hi> grace
is <hi>abating;</hi> as the spleen grows, health de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caies,
and as hatred increaseth, holiness de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines.</p>
                  <p>5 Not to love is very <hi>fatal;</hi> the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:106547:107"/>

is to humour sin.</p>
                  <p>2 To indulge sin, is to commit it with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,

                  <p>In this sense a godly man doth not indulge
sin; though sin be in him, hee is troubled at
it, and would fain get rid of it; there is as
much difference between sin in the wicked,
and the godly, as between poyson being in a
Serpent, and in a Man; Poyson in a Serpent,
is in its natural place, and is delightful: But
poyson in a mans body is offensive, and hee
useth Antidotes to expel it. So sin in a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

but sin in a childe of God is burdensome, and
he useth all means to expell it. This pares

to commit gross sin, that would be a stain to
their reputation, but they will sit brooding
upon sin in a corner, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 9. Saul <hi>secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:106547:108"/>
but perhaps they will sin behind the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
<hi>Rachel</hi> did not carry her fathers Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
as a Sumpter-cloath, to be exposed to
publick view, but she put them under her,
and sate upon them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 34. many carry
their sins secretly, as a candle in a dark lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>But a godly man dares not sin secretly: 1
he knows that God sees in secret, <hi>Psal.</hi> 44. 21.
as God cannot be deceived by our subtilty,
so he cannot be excluded by our secresy.</p>
                  <p>2 A godly man knows that secret sins are
in some sense worse than others: they disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
more guile and Atheism; The Curtain-sinner
makes himself beleeve God doth not

                  <p>3 A godly man knows that secret sins shal
not escape Gods Justice; a Judge on the
Bench can punish no offence but what is prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Witness; he cannot punish the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the heart: but the sins of the heart
are as visible to God, as if they were written
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:106547:108"/>
upon the fore-head. As God will reward se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
duties, so he will revenge secret sins.</p>
                  <p>2 A godly man will not allow himself in
<hi>gainful sins.</hi> Gain is the golden bait, with
which Satan fisheth for souls.
<q>—dulcis odor lucri—</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the last temptation hee used to
Christ, <hi>Mat. 4. 9. All this will I give thee.</hi> But
Christ saw the hook under the bait. Many
who have escaped gross sins, yet are caught
in a golden Net: To gain the world, they
will use indirect courses. A godly man dares
not travel for riches thorow the Devils
high-way. Those are sad gains, that make
a man lose peace of conscience, and heaven
at last. He who getteth an estate by inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
stuffs his pillow with thorns, and his
head will lye very uneasie when he comes to
dye.</p>
                  <p>3 A godly man will not allow himself in
a <hi>beloved sin;</hi> there is usually one sin that is
the<note n="†" place="margin">Peccatum in delitiis. <hi>Aug.</hi>

some sins a man can make better resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
against; if they come for entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he can more easily put them off; but
there is one sin, if that comes to be a suitor,
hee cannot deny it, but is overcome by it,
this is the bosome sin. The young man in
the Gospel, had given a repulse to many
sins, but there was one sin foiled him, that
was covetousness: Christians, mark what
sins you are soonest led captive by, that is
the Harlot in your bosome. 'Tis a sad thing
that a man should bee so bewitched by lust,
that if it ask to part with, not only <hi>half the
Kingdome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Esth. 7. 2.</note> but the whole Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
hee must part with it, to gratifie that
lust.</p>
                  <p>4 That sin which men use arguments to
defend, is the beloved sin; he that hath a jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>l
in his bosome, will defend it as his life;
so when there is any sin in the bosome, men
will defend it; the sin we are advocates and
disputants for, is the complexion-sin; if the
sin be passion, and we plead for it, <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. 4. 9. I
do well to be angry:</hi> if the sin be covetousness,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:106547:110"/>
and we vindicate it, and perhaps wrest Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to justifie it, that is the sin which lies
neerest the heart.</p>
                  <p>5. That sin which doth most trouble us,
and flies most in our face in an hour of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and distress, that is the Dalilah-sin:
When <hi>Iosephs</hi> Brethren were distressed, their
sin came to remembrance, in selling their
Brother, <hi>Gen. 42. 21. We are verily guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
our brother, in that we saw the anguish of
our brother when he be sought us, and we would
not hear, therefore is this distress come upon us.</hi>
So, when a man is upon his Sick-bed, and
Conscience shall say, thou hast been guilty
of such a sin, thou didst go on in it, and roul
it as honey under thy tongue, Conscience
reads a sad Lecture, sure that was the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
sin.</p>
                  <p>6. That sin which a man doth most hardly
let go his hold of, is the endeared sin: <hi>Iacob</hi>
could of all his sons most hardly part with
<hi>Benjamin, Gen.</hi> 42. 36. Joseph <hi>is not, and</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon
<hi>is not, and ye will take</hi> Benjamin <hi>away:</hi>
So saith the sinner, this and that sin I have
parted with, but must <hi>Benjamin</hi> go, must I
part with this delightful sin, that goes to the
heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As it is with a Castle that hath seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Forts about it, the first and second Fort
are taken, but when it comes to the Castle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:106547:110"/>
the Governour will rather fight and die than
yield that: So a man may suffer some of his
sins to be demolished, but when it comes to
<hi>one</hi> sin, that is the taking of the Castle, he
will never yield to part with that; surely,
that is the Master-sin.</p>
                  <p>The complexion-sin is a God-provoking
sin. The wise men of <hi>Troy</hi> counselled <hi>Priame</hi>
to send back <hi>Helena</hi> to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
himself to be any longer abused by
the Charms of her beauty, because the
keeping her within the City, would lay the
foundation of a fatal war: So should we
put away our <hi>Dalilah-sin,</hi> least it incense the
God of heaven, and make him commence a
war against us.</p>
                  <p>The complexion-sin is of all other most
dangerous: As <hi>Sampsons</hi> strength lay in his
hair, so the strength of sin lies in this belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
sin: This is like an humour striking to
the heart, which brings death. A godly man
will lay the Axe of Repentance to this sin,
and hew it down; he sets this sin, as <hi>Uriah,</hi> in
the fore-front of the battel, that it may be
slain: He will sacrifice this <hi>Isaack,</hi> he will
pluck out this <hi>right eye,</hi> that he may see the
better to go to heaven.</p>
                  <p>4. A godly man will not allow himself in
those which the world counts <hi>lesser sins:</hi>
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:106547:111"/>
There is no such thing as little sin, yet some
may be deemed less comparatively; but a
good man will not indulge himself in these.</p>

                  </p>

fast by one sin.</p>
                  <p>2. One sin lived in argues the heart is not
sound; he who hides one Rebel in his house
is a Traytor to the Crown; that person who
indulgeth one sin, is a trayterous hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite.</p>
                  <p>3. One sin will make way for more; as a

if there be but one Nest-egg, the Devil can
brood upon it.</p>
                  <p>4. One sin is as well a breach of Gods
Law as more, <hi>Iam. 2. 10. He that shall offend
in one point, is guilty of all.</hi> If the King
make a Law against Felony, Treason, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if a man be guilty but of one of these,
he is as well a Transgressor of the Law, as if
he were guilty of all.</p>
                  <p>5. One sin lived in keeps out Christ from
entring; one stone in the Pipe keeps out the
water; one sin indulg'd obstructs the soul,
and keeps the streams of Christs Bloud from
running into it.</p>
                  <p>6. One sin lived in will spoil all thy good

5. One Bastard-sin will destroy threescore
and ten prayers: One dead fly will corrupt
the box of oyntment.</p>
                  <p>7. One sin lived in will be a Canker-worm
to eat out the peace of Conscience, it takes

his comfort; one jarring string brings all the
Musick out of tune; one sin countenanced,
will spoil the Musick of Conscience.</p>
                  <p>8. One sin allowed will damn as well as
more; one disease is enough to kill: If a
Fence be made never so strong, leave open
but one gap, the wilde Beast may enter, and
tread down the corn: If there be but one sin
allowed in the soul, you set open a gap for the

one sin: One Milstone will <hi>sink</hi> a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea as well as an hundred.</p>
                  <p>9. One sin harboured in the soul will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
for suffering: How soon may an hour of
Tryal come; he who hath an hurt in his
shoulder, cannot carry an heavy burden, and
he who hath any guilt in his Conscience, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
carry the Cross of Christ: Will he deny
his life for Christ, that cannot deny his lust
for Christ? One sin in the soul unmortified,
will bring forth the bitter fruit of Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</p>

Zeal in a Minister, is as proper as fire

The Husband should shew his love to his

occasions of strife, by sweet endearing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
by pious counsel, by love-tokens,
by incouraging what he sees amiable and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
in her, by mutual prayer, by associat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:106547:115"/>
with her, unless detained by urgency of
business: The Pilot that goes from his ship,
and quite leaves it to the merciless waves,
declares that he doth not esteem it, or reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any treasure to be in it.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle gives a good reason, why
there should be mutual love between Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band

look to reap any good from a childe, where
he hath not sown the seed of wholesome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;
and though notwithstanding all
counsel and admonition, the childe should
dye in sin, yet it is a comfort to a godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:106547:115"/>
to think that before his childe dyed,
he gave it spiritual physick.</p>
                  <p>2. A parent must pray for his Children:
<hi>Monica</hi> the Mother of <hi>Austin,</hi> prayed for
his Conversion, and one said, It was impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a Son of so many Prayers and Tears
should miscarry: The soul of thy Childe is
in a snare, and wilt not thou pray that it may
bee <hi>recovered out of the snare of the Devil,
2 Tim.</hi> 2. 26. many Parents are careful to lay up
portions for their children, but they do not
lay up prayers for them.</p>
                  <p>3 A Parent must give his children disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
<hi>Prov. 23. 13. Withhold not correction
from the childe, for if thou beatest him with the
rod, he shall not dye:</hi> The rod beats out the
dust and moth of sin; a childe indulg'd and
humoured in wickedness, will prove a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

                  <p>5 He is godly who is good, as a <hi>Master;</hi>
a godly man promotes religion in his family;
he sets up piety in his house, as well as in his

heart, <hi>Psalm 101. 2. I will walk within
my house with a perfect heart, Ioshua 24.
15. I, and my houshold will serve the Lord.</hi>
I find it written in the honor of <hi>Cranmer,</hi> his
Family was <hi>Palaestra Pietatis,</hi> a Nursery of
Piety: A godly mans house is a little
Church, <hi>Col. 4. 15. The Church which is in
his house.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. A good man makes known the Oracles
of God to them, who are under his roof; he
reads the Word, perfumes his house with
prayer: It is recorded of the <hi>Iews,</hi> that
they had sacrifices in their <hi>Family,</hi> as well as
in the <hi>Tabernacle, Exod.</hi> 12. 3.</p>
                  <p>2. A godly man provides necessaries; he
relives his servants in health and Sickness;
he is not like that <hi>Amalakite,</hi> who shook off
his servant when he was sick, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 13.
But rather like the good <hi>Centurion,</hi> who
sought to Christ for the healing of his sick
servant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 5.</p>
                  <p>3. A godly man sets his servants a good
example, he is sober and heavenly in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment,
his virtuous life is a fair glass for
the servants in the family to dress themselves
by.</p>
                  <p>6. He is godly who is good in the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a <hi>Childe, He honours his parents. Philo</hi>
the Jew, placed the fifth Commandment in
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:106547:116"/>
the first Table; as if Children had not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
their whole devotion to God, till
they had given honour to their Parents. This
honouring of Parents consists in two things.</p>
                  <p>1. In reverencing their persons; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
is shown both by humility of speech
and gesture: The contrary to this is, when a
Childe doth behave himself unseemly and
proudly. Among the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> if a
Childe had carried himself imperiously to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his parent, it was published by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
that it was lawful for the Father to
appoint whom he would to be his Heir, and
to dis-inherit that Childe.</p>
                  <p>2. Honoring of Parents lies in obeying
their Commands, <hi>Eph. 6. 1. Children obey
your Parents in the Lord.</hi> Duty is the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
money which children pay their Parents,

Christ hath set all Children a pattern of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to their Parents, <hi>Luke 2. 51. He was
subject unto them.</hi> The <hi>Rechabites</hi> were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
for this, <hi>Ierem. 35. 5. 1 set before the
Rechabites pots full of wine, and said to them
drink ye wine, but they said we will drink no
wine, for</hi> Jonadab <hi>the son of</hi> Rechab <hi>our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
commanded us saying, Ye shall drink no
wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever. Solon</hi>
among the many Laws he made, one asked
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:106547:117"/>
him, Why he made no Law against disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Children; he answered, because he
thought none would be so wicked. God
hath punished Children, who have refused
to pay the tribute of obedience. <hi>Absalom,</hi> a
disobedient son, was hanged in an Oak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Heaven and Earth, as being worthy of
neither. <hi>Manlius,</hi> an old man, being redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to much poverty, and having a rich son,
he entreated him only for an alms, but could
not obtain it; the son disowned him as his
Father, and gave him reproachful language;
the poor old man let tears fall (as witnesses
of his grief) and went away; God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
this disobedience of the son, soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
struck him with<note n="†" place="margin">Beards <hi>Theat.</hi>

                  <p>6. <hi>He is godly who is good as a</hi> servant,
Col. 3. 22. Eph. 6. 5. Servants be subject to

                  </p>
                  <p>3. Faithfulness; which consists in two
things: 1. In not defrauding, <hi>Titus 2. 10. Not
purloyning.</hi> 2. In keeping counsel; it argues
the badness of a stomack, when it cannot
retain what is put into it; and the badness of
a servant, when he cannot retain those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
which his Master hath committed to
him.</p>
                  <p>4. Silentness, <hi>Titus 2. 9. Not answering <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Not to be good in our relations, spoils
all our other good things; <hi>Naaman</hi> was an

one is a great hearer, but he neglects relative
duties, this stains the beauty of all his other
actions; as in Printing, though the Letter be

                     <hi>Quest.</hi> What is it to perform spiritual duties
spiritually?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> It consists in three things.</p>
                  <p>1. To do duties from a spiritual principle,
<hi>viz. a renewed principle of grace:</hi> let a man have
gifts to admiration, let him have the most
melting ravishing expressions, let him speak
like an Angel dropped out of heaven, yet his
duties may not be spiritual, because he wants
the grace of the spirit; whatever a moral
unregenerate person doth, is but nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined,
though he may do duties better than
a godly man, yet not so well; better as to
the matter and elegancy, yet not so well, as
wanting a renewed principle; a Crab-tree
may bear as well as a Pippin, the fruit may
be bigger and fairer to the eye, yet it is not so
good fruit as the other, because it doth not
come from so good a stock; so an unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
person may perform as many duties as
a childe of God, and these may seem to be
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:106547:119"/>
more glorious to the outward view, but they
are harsh and sower, because they do not come
from the sweet and pleasant root of grace: a
true Saint gives God that wine, which comes
from the pure grape of the spirit.</p>
                  <p>2 To perform duties spiritually, is to do
them with the utmost intention; a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
is very serious, and labours to keep his
thoughts close to the work in hand, 1 <hi>Cor.
7. 35. That ye may attend upon the Lord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
distraction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But may not a godly man have ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thoughts in duty?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, sad experience sets seal to it,
the thoughts will bee dancing up and down
in prayer; the Saints are called <hi>Stars,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times in duty they are <hi>wandring stars.</hi>
The heart is like Quick-silver, which will

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1 From the pravity of nature, they
are the mud which the hear casts up.</p>
                  <p>2. From Satan; the Devil if he cannot hinder
us <hi>from</hi> duty, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

when we come before the Lord, he is <hi>at our
right hand to resist us, Zac.</hi> 3. 1. As when
one is going to write, another stands at his

oppose <hi>formality</hi> but <hi>fervency;</hi> if he sees we
set our selves in good earnest to seek God,
he will bee whispering things in our ears,
that wee can scarce minde what wee are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>3 These impertinent thoughts arise from
the world; these vermine are bred out of the
earth, worldly business oft crouds into our
duties, and while we are speaking to God,
our hearts are talking with the world, <hi>Ezek.
33. 31. They sit before me as my people, but their
heart goes after their covetousness.</hi> While we are
hearing the word, or meditating, one world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
business or other commonly knocks at the
door, and we are taken off the duty, while
we are in the duty. 'Tis with us as with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>

thoughts, that we may be more spiritual
in duty?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1 Eye Gods purity; hee is an holy
God whom wee serve, and cannot endure
when wee are worshipping him, that wee
should converse with vanity: Will a King
like it, that while his subject is speaking to
him, hee should bee playing with a feather?
will God endure light feathery hearts? how
devout and reverend are the Angels, they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their faces, and cry <hi>Holy, Holy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2 Think of the Grand importance of the
duties we are engaged in; as <hi>David</hi> said, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his building an house for God, 2
<hi>Chron. 29. 1. The work is great;</hi> when wee
are hearing the word, <hi>the work is great;</hi> this
is the word by which we shall be judged;
when we are at prayer, <hi>the work is great,</hi> wee
are pleading for the life of our souls, and is
this a time to trifle?</p>
                  <p>3 Come with affection to duty; the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of love, is to fix the minde upon the
object; he who is in love, his thoughts are
still upon the person he loves, and nothing
can take them off. Hee that loves the
world, his thoughts are ever intent upon it;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:106547:121"/>
were our hearts more fired with love, they
would be more fixed in duty; and O! what
cause have we to love duty? is not this the
direct road to heaven? do we not meet with
God here? can the spouse be better than in
her Husbands company? where can the soul
be better, than in drawing nigh to God?</p>
                  <p>4 Consider the mischief that these vain
distracting thoughts do; they fly-blow our
duties, they hinder fervency, they shew high
irreverence, they tempt God to turn away
his ear from us; how do we think God should
minde our prayers, when we our selves scarce
minde them?</p>
                  <p>3 To do duties spiritually, is to do them
in faith, <hi>Heb. 11. 4. By faith</hi> Abel <hi>offered a
better sacrifice than</hi> Cain.<note place="margin">

many people look no farther than
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:106547:121"/>
the bare doing of duties, but never mind
how they are done. God doth not judge of
our duties by the <hi>length,</hi> but by the <hi>love:</hi>
when men put God off with the dreggish
part of duty, may not he say as <hi>Isa. 58. 5. Is
it such a Fast that I have chosen?</hi> Are these
the duties I required? I called for the heart
and spirit, and you bring nothing but the
Carkass of Duty, should I receive comfort
in this?</p>

the heart makes the<note n="†" place="margin">Non chordula musica sed cor.</note> Musick; the spiritua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lizing
of duty gives life to it; without this,
it is dead praying, dead hearing, and dead
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:106547:122"/>
things are not pleasing; a dead flower hath
no beauty, a dead breast hath no sweetness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> How may we do to perform duties in a
spiritual manner?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Let the Soul be kept a Virgin;
lust doth besot and dis-spirit a man; beware of
any tincture of uncleanness, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 21. Wood
that is full of sap will not easily burn; and
an heart steeped in sin, is not fit to burn in
holy devotion. Can he be spiritual in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
who feeds carnal lust? <hi>Hos. 4. 11. Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and wine, and new wine, take away the
heart.</hi> Any sin lived in takes away the heart;
such an one hath no heart to pray, or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate:
The more alive the heart is in sin, the
more it dies to duty.</p>
                  <p>2. If we would be spiritual in duty, let us
revolve these two things in our mind.</p>
                  <p>1. The profit which comes from a duty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in a spiritual manner; it infeebles Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
it encreaseth Grace, it defeats Satan, it
strengthens our Communion with God, it
breeds peace of Conscience, it procures An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
of Mercy, and it leaves the heart al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in a better tune.</p>
                  <p>2. The danger of doing duties in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiritual
manner, they are as if they had not
been done; for what the heart doth not do,
is not<note n="*" place="margin">Quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid cor non facit non fit.</note> done: Duties slubbered over, turn
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:106547:122"/>
Ordinances into Judgements: Therefore ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
though they are often in duty, they go
away worse from duty: If Physick be not
well made, and the ingredients rightly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered,
it is as bad as poyson for the body:
So if duties are not well performed, they
leave the heart more hard and sinful than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>Duties unspiritual oft create Judgements
temporal, 1 <hi>Chron. 15. 13. The Lord our God
made a breach upon us, for that we sought him
not after the due order.</hi> Therefore God makes
breaches in Families and Relations, because
persons worship him not in that manner and
<hi>due order</hi> which he requires.</p>
                  <p>3. If we would have our duties spiritual,
we must get our hearts spiritual; an earthly
heart cannot be spiritual in duty: Let us
beg of God a spiritual pallat, to relish a
sweetness in holy things; for want of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
hearts, we come to duty without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
and go away without profit: If a man
would have the wheels of his Watch move
regularly, he must mend the Spring. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
if thou wouldst move more spiritually
in duty, get the Spring of thy heart mended.</p>

                     <hi>all my wills.</hi>
A godly man labours to walk according to
the full bredth and latitude of Gods Law.
Every Command hath the same stamp of
Divine Authority upon it, and he who is
godly, will obey one Command as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
<hi>Psal. 119. 6. Then shall I not be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
when I have respect to all thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
A godly man goes through all the
Body of Religion, as the Sun through all
the Signs of the Zodiack. He that is to
play upon a ten-stringed Instrument, must
strike upon every string, or he spoils all the
Musick. The ten Commandments may be
compared to a ten-stringed Instrument, we

it is fit the Childe should obey the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

Laws are like the Curtains of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
which were looped together; they are
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:106547:123"/>
like a Chain of Gold, where all the links are
coupled: A conscientious man will not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
break one Link of this Chain; if one
Command be violated, the whole Chain is
broken, <hi>Iam. 2. 10. Whosoever shall keep the
whole Law, yet offend in one point, is guilty of
all.</hi> A voluntary breach of one of Gods
Laws, involves a man in the guilt, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
him to the curse of the whole Law:
True obedience is intire and uniform: A
good heart, like the Needle, points that way
which the Load-stone draws.</p>
                  <p>This is a grand difference between a Childe
of God and an hypocrite; the hypocrite
doth pick and chuse in Religion; some du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
he will perform which are more facil, and
do gratifie his pride or interest, but other
duties he makes no reckoning of, <hi>Mat. 23. 23.
Ye pay tithe of Mint and Annis, and have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the weightier matters of the Law, Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Mercy, and Faith.</hi> To sweat in some
duties of Religion, and freeze in other, is
the symptom of a distempered Christian.
<hi>Iehu</hi> was zealous in destroying the Idolatry
of <hi>Baal,</hi> but let the <hi>golden Calves of</hi> Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam

are not good <hi>in truth,</hi> when they are good <hi>by

your work you set him about, and leave the

Lord saith, <hi>Walk before me, and be perfect,
Gen.</hi> 17. 1. How are our hearts perfect with
God, when we prevaricate with him? Some
things we will do, and other things we leave
undone; he is good, who is good univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally.

                  <p>1 A godly man will be often calling his

the word, and searcheth his inward parts,
<hi>Psa. 77. 6. I commune with my own heart, and
my spirit made diligent search:</hi> a gracious soul
searcheth whether there be any duty omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
any sin cherished; he examines his evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
for heaven; as hee will not take his
gold upon trust, so neither his grace; he is
a spiritual Merchant, hee casts up the estate
of his soul, to see what he is worth; he <hi>sets
his house in order;</hi> often reckonings keep God
and conscience friends; a carnal person can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
abide this heart-work, he is ignorant how

the affairs go in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> soul; he is like a man,
who is well acquainted in forraign parts, but
a stranger in his own country.
<q>—ut nemo insese tentat descendere, nemo?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>2 A godly man is much in closet-prayer,
he keeps his hours for private devotion;
<hi>Iacob</hi> when he was left alone, wrestled with
God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 24. So when a gracious heart
is alone, it wrestles in prayer, and will not
leave God till it hath a blessing; a devout
Christian exerciseth eyes of faith, and knees
of prayer.</p>

7. 12. Whatsoever ye would that men should do
to you, do ye even so to them.</hi> There is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
injustice in matters of dealing.</p>
                  <p>1 Using of false weights, <hi>Hos. 12. 7. The
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:106547:126"/>
ballances of deceit are in his hands:</hi> men by
making their weights lighter, make their sin
heavier, <hi>Amos 5. 8. They make the Ephah
small:</hi> the <hi>Ephah</hi> was a measure they used
in selling; they made the <hi>Ephah</hi> small, they
gave but scant measure; a godly man, who
takes the Bible in one hand, dares not use
false weights in the other.</p>
                  <p>2 Imbasing a commodity, <hi>Amos 8. 6.
They sell the refuse of the wheat:</hi> they would
pick out the best grains of the wheat, and
sell the worst at the same price as they did
the best, <hi>Isa. 1. 22. Thy wine is mixed with
water:</hi> they did adulterate their wine, yet
make their customers beleeve it came from
the pure grape.</p>
                  <p>3 Taking a great deal more than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
is worth, <hi>Lev. 25. 14. If thou sell
ought to thy neighbour, ye shall not oppress one
another:</hi> a godly man deals exactly, but not
exactingly, he will sell so as to help himself,
but not damnifie another. His motto is,
<hi>A conscience void of offence, towards God, and
towards men, Act.</hi> 23. 16.</p>
                  <p>The Hypocrite separates these two, which
God hath joyned together, <hi>Righteousness</hi>
and <hi>Holiness,</hi> he pretends to be pure, but is
not just: This brings religion into contempt,
when men hang forth Christs colours, yet
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:106547:126"/>
will use fraudulent circumvention, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a mask of piety, neglect morality; a

walk according to the full bredth of Gods Law,
and to follow God fully?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> There is a two-fold obeying Gods
Law; the first is <hi>perfect;</hi> when all is done
that the Law requires, this we cannot arrive
at in this life. Secondly, There is an <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat</hi>
obedience, which in Christ is accepted.
This consists in four things.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>An</hi> approving <hi>of all Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
Rom. 7. 12. The Commandment is just,
and holy, and good; <hi>and</hi> ver. 16. I consent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Law that it is good. <hi>There is both</hi> assent,
<hi>and</hi> consent.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>A sweet</hi> complacency <hi>in Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi>
Psal. 119. 47. I will delight my self in
thy Commandments which I have loved.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>A cordial desire to walk in all Gods
Commands,</hi> Psal. 119. 5. O that my ways were
directed to keep thy Statutes.</p>
                  <p>4. A real endeavour to tread in every
path of the Command, <hi>Psal. 119. 59. I turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my feet unto thy Testimonies.</hi> This God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steems
perfect obedience, and is pleased to
take it in good part. <hi>Zacharias</hi> had his fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
he did hesitate through unbelief, for
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:106547:129"/>
which he was strucken dumb; yet it is said
he did <hi>walk in all the Commandments of the
Lord blameless, Luke</hi> 1. 6. Because he did
cordially endeavour to obey God in all
things. Evangelical obedience is true for the
<hi>essence,</hi> though not perfect for the <hi>degree;</hi> and
wherein it comes short, Christ puts his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
into the Scales, and then there is full
weight.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Walking with God imports five
things.</p>
                  <p>1. A walking as under Gods eye: <hi>Noah</hi>
did reverence a Deity: A godly man sets
himself as in Gods presence, knowing his
Judge looks<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

Lord always before me,</hi> Here was <hi>Davids</hi> Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
                  <p>2. Walking with God implies the famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity
and intimacy the soul hath with God:
Friends walk together, and solace themselves
one with another: The godly make known
their requests to God, and he makes known
his love to them. There is a sweet intercourse
between God and his people, 1 <hi>Iohn
1. 3. Our <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, our Communion is with the
Father, and his Son Iesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Walking with God, is a walking above
the earth: A godly man is elevated above
all sublunary objects; that person must as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
very high, who walks with God: A
Dwarf cannot walk among the Stars; nor
can a dwarfish earthly soul walk with God.</p>
                  <p>4. Walking with God, denotes visible
piety; walking is a visible posture; grace
must be conspicuous to the beholders: He
walks with God, who discovers something of
God in his carriage; he shines forth in a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-Conversation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:106547:130"/>
5. Walking with God, imports a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
progress in Grace; it is not only a <hi>step,</hi>
but a <hi>walk;</hi> there is a going on towards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
A godly man doth not sit down in
the middle of his way, but goes on till he
comes at the<note n="†" place="margin">Quid prodest currere &amp; ante cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus metam defecere? <hi>Bern.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>end of his Faith, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 9.
Though a good man may be <hi>extra semitam,</hi>
yet not <hi>extra viam:</hi> He may through infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
step aside (as <hi>Peter</hi> did) but he recovers
himself by repentance, and goes on in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
of holiness, <hi>Iob 17. 9. The righteous
also shall hold on his way.</hi>

is to call them godly, who do not walk with
God: They would have <hi>Noahs</hi> Crown, but
they do not love <hi>Noahs</hi> walk: Most are found
in the Devils black walk, <hi>Phil. 3. 18. Many
walk, of whom I tell you weeping, that they are
the Enemies of the Cross of</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>1. Some will commend walking with God,
and say it is the rarest life in the world, but
will not set one foot in the way; all that
commend Wine do not come up to the price;
many a Father commends virtue to his
Childe, but doth not set him a pattern.</p>

                     <hi>way,</hi> but they retreat back again: If the
ways of God were not good, why did they
enter into them? If they were good, why
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:106547:130"/>
did they forsake them? 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 21. For it
had been better for them not to have known the
way of righteousness, than after they have known
it, to turn from the holy Commandment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Others slander walking with God, that
it is a melancholly walk, and such as are less
zealous, are more prosperous; this God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts

                  <p>Thus Sinners walk after the flesh, if a
drunken or unclean lust call, they gratifie it;
they brand all for cowards, who dare not sin
after the same rate as they do. These in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of walking with God, walk contrary to

                  <p>2 If we walk with God, then we walk in
the fear of God, <hi>Gen. 5. 22. Enoch walked
with God:</hi> The <hi>Chalde</hi> Version renders it,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:106547:132"/>
                     <hi>he walked in the fear of the Lord;</hi> the godly are
fearful of that which may displease God,
<hi>Gen. 39. 9. How then can I do this great wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
and sin against God:</hi> this is not a base
servile fear, but</p>
                  <p>1 A fear springing from affection, <hi>Hos.</hi> 3.
5. a childe fears to offend his father, out of
the tender affection he bears to him: This
made holy <hi>Anselm</hi> say, If Sin were on one
side, and Hell on the other, I would rather
leap into Hell, than willingly offend my
God.</p>
                  <p>2 It is a fear joyned with affiance, <hi>Heb. 11.
7. By faith,</hi> Noah <hi>moved with fear:</hi> Faith
and fear go hand in hand; when the soul
looks upon Gods holiness, he fears; when he
looks upon Gods promises, he beleeves: A
godly man doth <hi>tremble,</hi> yet <hi>trust;</hi> fear pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
reverence,
faith preserves chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
fear keeps the soul from lightness,
faith keeps it from overmuch sadness: By
this we may know whether we walk with
God, if we walk <hi>in the fear of God,</hi> we are
fearful of infringing his Laws, and forfeiting
his love: It is a brand set upon sinners, <hi>Rom.
3. 18. They have not the fear of God before

<hi>Psa.</hi> 4. 4. the wicked offend and fear not,

will soon estrange God from us, and make
him weary of our company, 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 4. What

                     <note place="margin">Exhort.</note>
Though the truth of grace be in the heart,
yet the beauty of it is seen in the walk.</p>
                  <p>1. Walking with God is very pleasing to
God: He that walks with God, declares to
the world what is the company he loves
most; <hi>his fellowship is with the Father;</hi> he
counts those the sweetest hours which are
spent with God; this is very grateful and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 24. Enock <hi>walked
with God.</hi> And see how kindly God took
this at <hi>Enocks</hi> hands, <hi>Heb. 11. 4. He had this
testimony, that he pleased God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Close walking with God, will be a good
means to intice and allure others to walk
with him. The Apostle exhorts Wives to
walk so, that the Husbands might be won by
the Conversation of the<note n="*" place="margin">Est pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis odor.</note> Wives, 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 1.
Iustin Martyr</hi> confessed he became a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
by beholding the holy and innocent lives
of the Primitive<note n="†" place="margin">Euseb.</note> Saints.</p>
                  <p>3. Close walking with God, would put
to silence the Adversaries of the Truth,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 15. A loose carriage, puts a Sword
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:106547:133"/>
into wicked mens hands to wound Religion:
What a sad thing is it, when it shall be said of
Professors, they are as proud, as coverous,
as unjust as others: Will not this expose the
ways of God to contempt? But holy and
close walking, would stop the mouths of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
that they should not be able to speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Gods people, without giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the lye. Satan came to Christ, and
<hi>found nothing in him, Iohn</hi> 14. 30. What a
confounding thing will it be to the wicked,
when they shall have nothing to fasten as a
crime upon the godly, but their holiness,
<hi>Dan. 6. 5. We shall not find any occasion against
this</hi> Daniel, <hi>unless we find it against him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Law of his God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Walking with God is a pleasant walk:
The ways of Wisdome are called <hi>Pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Pro.</hi> 3. 17. Is not the light pleasant?
<hi>Psal. 89. 15. They shall walk (O Lord,) in the

is it which brings peace, <hi>Act. 9. 31. Walking
in the fear of the Lord, and in the joys of the
Holy Ghost.</hi> While we walk with God, what
sweet Musick doth the Bird of Conscience
make in our breast? <hi>Psal. 138. 5. They shall

5. Walking with God is honourable; it
is a credit for one of an inferiour rank to walk
with a King: What greater dignity can be
put upon a mortal man, than to converse
with his Maker, and to take a turn with God
every day.</p>
                  <p>6. Walking with God leads to rest, <hi>Heb.
4. 9. There remains a rest for the people of God.</hi>
The Philosopher saith, <hi>Motion tends to</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Motus tendit ad quietem.</note> 
                     <hi>rest.</hi>
Indeed there is a motion which doth not tend
to rest; they who walk with their sins shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have rest, <hi>Re. 4. 8. They rest not day &amp; night:</hi>
But they that walk with God, shal sit down in
the Kingdom of God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 29. As a weary
traveller when he comes home sits down and
rests him, <hi>Rev. 3. 21. To him that overcomes
will I grant to sit with me in my Throne.</hi> A
Throne denotes <hi>Honor,</hi> &amp; <hi>sitting,</hi> denotes rest.</p>
                  <p>7. Walking with God is the most safe
walking: Walking in the ways of sin, is like
walking upon the edge of a River: The sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
treads upon the banks of the bottomless
Pit, and if Death gives him a jogg, he tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
in; but it is safe going in Gods way,
<hi>Pro. 3. 23. Then shalt thou walk in thy way safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi>
He walks safe, who walks with a Guard;
he that walks with God, shall have Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to guard him from sin, and Gods Angels
to guard him from danger, <hi>Psal.</hi> 91. 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:106547:134"/>
8. Walking with God will make death
sweet: It was <hi>Augustus</hi> his wish, that he
might have an <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a quiet easie death,
without much pain. If any thing make our
Pillow easie at death, it will be this, that we
have walked with God in our Generation:
Do we think walking with God can do us any
hurt? Did we ever hear any cry out upon
their Death-bed, that they have been too
holy, that they have prayed too much, or
walked with God too much? No, that
which hath cut them to the heart, hath been
this, that they have walked no more closely
with God; they have wrung their hands,
and torn their hair, to think that they have
been so bewitched with the pleasures of the
World: Close walking with God, will make
our Enemy <hi>(Death)</hi> to be at peace with us.
King <hi>Ahashuerus,</hi> when he could not sleep,
called for the <hi>Book of Records,</hi> and read in it,
<hi>Esther</hi> 6. 1. So when the violence of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
causeth sleep to depart from our eyes,
and we can call for Conscience (that Book of
Records) and find written in it, such a day
we humbled our souls by fasting, such a day
our hearts melted in prayer; such a day we
had sweet communion with God; what a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving
will this be? How may we look death
in the face with comfort, and say, Lord, now
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:106547:134"/>
take us up to thee in Heaven, where we have
so often been by <hi>affection,</hi> let us now be by
<hi>fruition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9 Walking with God; is the best way to
know the minde of God; friends who walk
together, impart their secrets one to another,
<hi>Psa. 25. 14. The secrets of the Lord, is with
them that fear him. Noah</hi> walked with God,
and the Lord revealed a great secret to him,
of destroying the Old World, and saving
him in the Ark. <hi>Abraham</hi> walked with
God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 40. and God made him one
of his Privy-council, <hi>Gen. 18. 17. Shall I
hide from</hi> Abraham <hi>that thing which I do?</hi>
God doth sometimes sweetly unbosome
himself to the soul in Prayer, and in the holy
Supper, as Christ made himself known to the
Disciples, in the breaking of bread, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 35</p>
                  <p>10 They who walk with God, shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be wholly left of God; the Lord may
retire himself for a time, to make his people
cry after him the more, but he will not quite
leave them, <hi>Isa. 54. 8. I hid my face for a
moment, but with everlasting kindeness will I
have mercy on thee.</hi> God will not cast off any
of his old acquaintance, he will not part with
one that hath born him company. <hi>Enoch</hi>
walked with God, and <hi>he was not, for God
took him, Gen.</hi> 5. 24. He took him up to
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:106547:135"/>
heaven, as the <hi>Arabick</hi> renders it; <hi>Enoch</hi>
was lodged in the bosome of divine Love.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> How may we do to walk with God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1 Get out of the old road of sin;
hee that would walk in a pleasant meadow,
must turn out of the road. The way of sin is
full of Travellers, there are so many travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in this road, that hell, though it be of
a great circumference, is fain to enlarge it
self, and make room for them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 14.
This way of sin seems pleasant, but the end
is damnable. <hi>I have</hi> (saith the Harlot) <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed
my bed, with Mirrhe, Aloes, and Cinamon,
Prov.</hi> 7. 17. See how with <hi>one sweet</hi> (the
Cinamon) there were <hi>two bitters,</hi> Myrrhe,
and Aloes: for that little sweet in sin at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
there will be a far greater proportion
of bitterness afterwards: Therefore get out of
these briars, you cannot walk with God and
sin, 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 14. What fellowship hath righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with unrighteousness?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2 If you would walk with God, get ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with him, <hi>Iob 22. 21. Acquaint
now thy self with him.</hi> Know God in his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
and promises; strangers do not walk
together.</p>
                  <p>3 Get all differences removed, <hi>Amos 3. 3.
Can two walk together except they are agreed?</hi>
This agreement and reconciliation is made
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:106547:135"/>
by faith, <hi>Rom. 3. 25. Whom God hath set
forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his
blood.</hi> When once we are friends, then we
shall be called up to the <hi>Mount</hi> as <hi>Moses,</hi> and
have this dignity conferred on us, to bee
the favourites of heaven, and to walk with
God.</p>
                  <p>4 If you would walk with God, get a
liking to the vvaies of God: They are ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vvith beauty, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 18. svveetned
vvith pleasure, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 17. fenced vvith
truth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 3. accompanied vvith Life, <hi>Acts</hi>
2. 28. lengthned with eternity, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 6.
be enamoured with the way of Religion,
and you will soon walk in it.</p>
                  <p>5 If you would walk with God, take
hold of his arm; such as walk in their own
strength, will soon grow weary and tire:
<hi>Psal. 71. 16. I will go in the strength of the
Lord God:</hi> We cannot walk with God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God; let us press him with his promise,
<hi>Isa. 36. 27. I will cause you to walk in my sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes:</hi>
If God take us by the hand, then we
shall <hi>walk and not faint, Isa.</hi> 40. 31.</p>

content to go to heaven alone, but would bring
others thither; Spiders work only for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but Bees work for others: A godly
man is both a <hi>Diamond</hi> and a <hi>Load-stone;</hi> a
Diamond for the sparkling lustre of grace,
and a Load-stone for his attractiveness, he is
ever drawing others to the embracing of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety:
Living things have a propagating vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
where Religion lives in the heart, there
will be an endeavour to propagate the life of
grace, in those we converse with, <hi>Philemon
v. 10. My son</hi> Onesimus, <hi>whom I have begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in my bonds.</hi> Though God be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of grace, yet the Saints are pipes to
transmit living streams to others. This thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
endeavour after the conversion of souls,
proceeds,</p>
                  <p>1 From the nature of Godliness; it is like
fire, which assimilates and turns every thing
into its own nature; where there is the fire of
grace in the heart, it will endeavour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
others; grace is an holy leaven, which
will be seasoning and leavening others with
divine principles. <hi>Paul</hi> would fain have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<hi>Agrippa;</hi> how did he court him with
Rhetorick? <hi>Act. 26. 27. King</hi> Agrippa, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevest
thou the Prophets? I know that thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevest:</hi>
his Zeal and Eloquence had almost

                  </p>
                  <p>2 A godly man attempts the conversion
of others, out of a spirit of compassion:
Grace makes the heart tender; a godly man
cannot chuse but pitty such as are <hi>in the gall
of bitterness;</hi> he sees what a deadly cup is a
brewing for the wicked; they must without
repentance, be bound over to Gods wrath;
the fire which rained on <hi>Sodome,</hi> was but a
painted fire, in comparison of hell-fire; this
is a fire with a vengeance, <hi>Iude 7. Suffering
the Vengeance of eternal fire:</hi> now, a godly
man seeing captive Sinners ready to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
labours to convert them from the errour
of their way, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 11. Knowing the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of the Lord, we perswade men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3 A godly man endeavours the good of
others, out of an holy zeal he bears to Christs
glory; the glory of Christ is dear to him, as
his own salvation; therefore that this may be
promoted, he labours <hi>Summo conatu,</hi> to
bring in souls to Christ.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a glory to Christ, when multitudes
are born to him; every star adds a lustre to
the sky, every convert, is a member added

He who loves his Captain, will perswade o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

Let souls go to the Devil, he cares not.</p>
                  <p>2. How far are they from being godly,<note place="margin">2 Bran.</note>
who instead of endeavouring Grace in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

their work is to poyson and mischief souls:
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:106547:137"/>
This mischieving of souls is three ways.</p>

louder than Precepts; but principally the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples

when that went, <hi>Israel</hi> went: If great ones
move irregularly, others will follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

3. If it be the sign of a godly man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Grace in others,<note place="margin">3 Bran.</note> then much more ought
he to promote it in his neer Relations. A
godly man will be careful that his Children
should know God; he would be sorry that
any of his flesh should burn in hell; he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to see Christ formed in them, who
are himself in another Edition. <hi>Austin</hi> saith,
That his Mother <hi>Monica</hi> travelled with
greater care and pain for his Spiritual Birth,
than for his<note n="†" place="margin">Lib. 5. Confess.</note> Natural.</p>
                  <p>The time of Childhood is the fittest time
to be sowing seeds of Religion in our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<hi>Isa. 28. 9. Whom shall he make understand
Doctrine? Them that are weaned from the
milk, that are drawn from the breasts.</hi> The
Wax, while it is soft and tender, will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
impression: Children while they are
young will fear a reproof, when they are old
they will hate it,</p>
                  <p>1. It is pleasing to God that our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
should know him betimes: When you
come into a garden, you love to pluck the
young bud, and smell to it; God loves a
Saint in the bud; of all the Trees the Lord
made choice of in a Prophetical Vision, it
was the Almond Tree, which blossomes one
of the first of the<note n="*" place="margin">Jer. 1 11</note> Trees: Such an Almond
Tree is an early Convert.</p>

2. By endeavouring to bring up our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in the fear of the Lord, we shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for Gods glory when we are<note n="†" place="margin">Celebre honoris di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vini tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaeum, etiam mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tui in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum fere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</note> dead.
A godly man should not only honor God
while he lives, but do something that may
promote Gods glory when he is dead: Our
Children being seasoned with gracious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
will stand up in our room, when we
are gone, and will glorifie God in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
A good piece of ground doth not
only bear a fore-crop, but an after-crop; he
that is godly, doth not only bear God a crop
of obedience himself while he lives, but by
principling his Childe with Religion, he bears
God an after-crop when he is dead.</p>

Piety in others: A Knife touched
with a Loadstone will draw the Needle; he
whose heart is divinely touched with the
Loadstone of Gods Spirit, will endeavour
to draw those who are neer him to Christ:
The Heathen could say, <hi>We are not born for
our selves</hi>

thing is, the more communicative; in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

light, the head spirits, the liver bloud;
a Christian must not move altogether within
his own circle, but endeavour the welfare of

                     <note n="†" place="margin">Vir bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus magis aliis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest quam sibi.</note>others: To be diffusively good, makes us
resemble God, whose sacred influence is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal.</p>
                  <p>And surely it will be no grief of heart,
when Conscience can witness for us, that we
have brought glory to God in this manner,
by labouring to fill heaven.</p>
                  <p>Not that this is any ways Meritorious,<note place="margin">Caution.</note> or
hath any causal influence upon our Salvation.
Christs bloud is the cause; but our promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Gods glory in the Conversion of others,
is a signal evidence of our Salvation: As the
Rain-bow is not a cause why God will not
drown the World, but it is a sign that he will
not drown it; or as <hi>Rahabs</hi> Scarlet thread she

why she was exempted from destruction, but
it was a sign of her being exempted; so our
building up others in the Faith, is not a cause
why we are saved, but it is a Symbole of our
Piety, and a presage of our felicity.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have shown the Marks and

               <head type="sub">Containing two Conclusions.</head>
               <p>COncerning the Characteristical signs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned,
I shall lay down two
Conclusions.</p>
               <p>1 These Characters are a Christians <hi>box of
evidences;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Conclus.</note> for as an impenitent sinner hath the
signs of reprobation upon him, whereby, as
by so many <hi>spots</hi> and <hi>tokens,</hi> he may know
he shall dye; so he who can shew these happy
signs of a godly man, may see the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes
of Salvation in his Soul, and may
know he is <hi>passed from death to life;</hi> he is as
sure to go to heaven, as if he were in heaven
already; such a person is undoubtedly a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Christ, and if he should perish, then
something of Christ might perish.</p>
               <p>These blessed Characters, may comfort
a Christian under all <hi>worldly dejections,</hi> and
<hi>Diabolical suggestions;</hi> Satan tempts a Childe
of God with this, that he is an hypocrite,
and hath no title to the Land of promise; a
Christian may pull out these evidences, and
put the Devil to prove, that ever any wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man or hypocrite, had such a fair Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:106547:140"/>
to shew for heaven: Satan may sooner
prove himself a lyar, than the Saint an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite.</p>
               <p>2 He who hath one of these Characters
in truth,<note place="margin">2 Conclus.</note> hath seminally all, he who hath
one link of a Chain, hath the whole Chain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But may a Childe of God say, either
I have not all these Characters, or they are so
weakly wrought in me, that I cannot discern
them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> To satisfie this scruple, you must
diligently observe the distinctions the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
gives of Christians; it casts them into
several classes and orders; some are <hi>infantu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,
little children,</hi> who are but newly laid to
the breast of the Gospel; others are <hi>adulti,
Young men,</hi> who are grown up to more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity
of Grace; others are <hi>patres, Fathers,</hi>
who are ready to take their degree of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 12. 13, 4. Now, you who
are but in the first rank or classis, yet you
may have the <hi>vitals</hi> of Godliness, as well as
those who have arrived at an higher stature
in Christ: the Scripture speaks of the <hi>Cedar,</hi>
and the <hi>bruised Reed,</hi> the last of which is as
true a Plant of the heavenly Paradise, as the
other; so that the weakest ought not to be
discouraged; all have not these characters of
godliness written <hi>in Text-Letters,</hi> if they be
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:106547:140"/>
but dimly stamped upon their souls, God
can read the work of his spirit there. Though
the seal be but weakly set upon the wax, it
ratifies the will, and gives a real conveyance
of an estate:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Trespasses:</hi> dead they must needs be,
who are cut off from Christ, the principle of
life; for as the body without the soul is dead,
so is the soul without Christ. This spiritual
death is visible in the effect, it bereaves men
of their senses: sinners have no sense of God
in them, <hi>Ephe. 4. 19. who being without feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>
all their moral endowments, are but
strewing flowers upon a dead corpse; and
what is hell, but a sepulchre to bury the dead
in.</p>
               <p>2 Their offerings are polluted; not only
the<note n="*" place="margin">Pro. 21. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Ploughing,</hi> but the <hi>praying</hi> of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Ordinance, he is a contemner of it, if he
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:106547:142"/>
doth come, hee is a defiler of it.</p>
               <p>3. Such as live and die ungodly, have no
right to the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Eph. 2. 12.
At that time ye were without Christ, <gap reason="foreign">

from the Covenants of Promise.</hi> And to
be without Covenant, is to be like one in the
old World, without an Ark. The Covenant
is the Gospel-Charter, which is enriched with
many glorious priviledges, but who may
plead the benefit of this Covenant? Surely
only such whose hearts are in-laid with grace.
Read the Charter, <hi>Ezek. 36. 26. A new heart
will I give you, and I will put my spirit within
you:</hi> Then it follows, <hi>ver. 28. I will be your
God.</hi> A person dying in his ungodliness, hath
no more to do with the New Covenant, than
a Ploughman hath to do with the priviledges
of a Corporation.</p>
               <p>Gods Writing is always before his Seal,
2 <hi>Cor. 3. 3. Ye are declared to be the Epistle of
Christ, written not with ink, but with the spirit
of the living God, not in Tables of stone, but
in fleshy Tables of the heart.</hi> Here is a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Epistle, the writing is the work of Faith,
the Table it is written in, is the heart, the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
that writes it is the spirit: Now, after the
Spirits writing, follows the Spirits sealing,
<hi>Ephes. 1. 13. After ye believed ye were sealed
with the Spirit;</hi> that is, ye were sealed up to

an assurance of glory: What have ungodly
men to do with the seal of the Covenant,

a Childe very beautiful, yet if he were a fool,

<hi>the precious and the vile, Ier.</hi> 15. 19.
Gods people are not <hi>censorious,</hi> but they are
<hi>juditious;</hi> they can see a wanton heart,
through a naked breast, and a spotted face;
they can see a revengeful spirit, through a
bitter tongue; they can guess at the <hi>Tree</hi> by
the <hi>fruit, Mat.</hi> 12. 33. They can see the
Plague-tokens of sin, appear in the wicked,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:106547:146"/>
which makes them remove from the tents of
those sinners, <hi>Num.</hi> 16. 26.</p>
               <p>2 The godly have insight into <hi>Things</hi> My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious.</p>
               <p>1 They can see much of the mystery of
their own hearts: Take the greatest Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
who understands <hi>the mysteries of state,</hi>
yet he doth not understand the mystery of
his own heart; you shall sometimes hear him
swear, his heart is good; but a Childe of
God sees much heart-corruption, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.
38. though some flowers of grace grow
there, yet he sees how fast the weeds of sin
grow, therefore is continually weeding his
heart by repentance and mortification.</p>
               <p>2 The godly can discern the mystery of
the times, 1 <hi>Chron. 12. 32. The children of</hi>
Issachar <hi>were men that had understanding of the
times:</hi> The godly can see when an age runs
dregs, when Gods name is dishonoured, his
messengers despised, his Gospel ecclipsed;
the people of God labour to keep their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
pure, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 15. their care is, that
the times may not be the worse for them, nor
they the worse for the times.</p>
               <p>3 The godly understand the mystery of
living by faith, <hi>Heb. 10. 38. The just shall
live by faith:</hi> they can <hi>trust</hi> God, where they
cannot <hi>trace</hi> him; they can fetch comfort out
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:106547:147"/>
of a promise, as <hi>Moses</hi> did water out of the
rock: <hi>Hab. 3. 17. Though the Fig-tree doth
not blossome, yet I will rejoyce in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 The godly have good foresight:</p>
               <p>1 They foresee the evil of a Temptation,
2 <hi>Cor. 2. 11. We are not ignorant of his devices;</hi>
The wicked swallow temptations like Pills,
and when it is too late, feel these Pills gripe
their Conscience; but the godly fore-see a
Temptation and will not come near; they
see a snake under the green grass, they know
Satans kindness, is craftiness; hee doth as
<hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and danceth before men with a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and then <hi>brings them very low, Iudg.</hi>
11. 35.</p>
               <p>2. The godly fore-see temporal dangers,
<hi>Pro. 22. 3. A prudent man foreseeth the evil,
and hideth himself.</hi> The people of God see
when the Cloud of wrath is ready to drop
upon a Nation, and they get into their <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
Isa.</hi> 26. 20. The Attributes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of God; and into the <hi>clifts of the
Rock,</hi> the bleeding wounds of Christ, and
hide themselves; well therefore may they
be baptized with the name of <hi>Wise Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. The godly are the bull-wark of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
2 <hi>Kin. 2. 12. O my Father, the Chariots
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:106547:147"/>
of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.</hi> The god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are the Pillers to keep a City and Nation
from falling; they stave off Judgement from
a Land: It was said of old, so long as <hi>Hector</hi>
lived, <hi>Troy</hi> could not be demolished: God
could do nothing to <hi>Sodom</hi> till <hi>Lot</hi> was
gone out of it, <hi>Genesis</hi> 19. 22. Golden
Christians are Brazen Walls. The Lord
would soon break up house in the world,
were it not for the sakes of a few Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
ones: Would God (think we) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the world only for Drunkards and
Swearers? He would soon sink the Ship of

are in it: Yet such is the indiscretion of

               <p>6. The godly are of a brave Heroick spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<hi>Numb. 14. 24. My servant</hi> Caleb, <hi>because
he had another spirit.</hi> An <hi>excellent spirit</hi> was
found in <hi>Daniel, Cap.</hi> 5. 12. The godly hate
that which is base and sordid, they will not
inrich their purses by inslaving their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;
they are Noble and couragious in
Gods Cause, <hi>Pro. 28. 1. The righteous are bold
as a Lion.</hi> The Saints live suitably to their
high birth, they breathe after Gods love,
they aspire after glory, they set their feet
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:106547:148"/>
where worldly men set their heart; they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play
the Banner of the Gospel, lifting up
Christs Name and interest in the world.</p>
               <p>7. The godly are happy persons: King
<hi>Balak</hi> sent to curse the people of God, but
the Lord would not suffer it, <hi>Numb. 22. 12.
God said unto</hi> Balaam, <hi>thou shalt not curse the
people, for they are blessed:</hi> And <hi>Moses</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
records it as a thing memorable, that
that intended Curse of the King, God did
convert into a blessing, <hi>Deut. 23. 5. The Lord
thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee.</hi>
They must needs be happy who are always
on the strongest side, <hi>Psa. 118. 6. The Lord is
on my side:</hi> they are happy who have all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
sanctified to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. Who
are crowned with peace while they live, <hi>Psa.</hi>
119. 165. and with glory when they die, <hi>Psal.</hi>
73. 24. And may not this tempt all to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
godly? <hi>Deut. 33. 29. Happy art thou,
O Israel; a people saved by the Lord.</hi>

               <p>3.<note place="margin">Motive</note> To endeavour after godliness, is most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
rational.</p>
               <p>1. It is the highest act of Reason, for a
man to become another man: If while he
remains in Natures Soil, he is poysoned with
sin, no more actually fit for communion with
God, than a Toad is fit to be made an Angel,
then it is very consonant to Reason, that he
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:106547:148"/>
should endeavour after a change.</p>
               <p>2. It is rational, because this change is for
the better, <hi>Eph. 5. 8. Now are yee light

thou changest a lust that will damn thee for

to the soul as the light to the world, to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
and adorn it: 'Tis not greatness sets

Godliness is the curious imbroidery and

3. 14. To be sure there is no profit in sin,
<hi>Pro. 10. 2. Treasures of wickedness profit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
But, <hi>godliness is profitable, 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 8.
It is like digging in a gold <hi>Mine,</hi> where there
is gain as well as toil: godliness makes God
himself over to us as a portion, <hi>Psa. 16. 5.
The Lord is the portion of my Inheritance:</hi> If
God be our portion, all our estate lies in
Jewels; where God gives himself, he gives
every thing else; he who hath the <hi>Mannor</hi>

it is profitable <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>for all things, 1 Tim.</hi>
4. 8. What is so besides godliness? Food
will not give a man wisdome, gold will not
give him health, honor will not give him
beauty; but godliness is useful for all things,
it fenceth off all troubles, it supplies all
wants, it makes soul and body compleatly
happy.</p>
               <p>5. Godliness is an enduring substance, it
knows no fall of the leaf.</p>
               <p>All worldly delights have a Deaths-Head
set upon them; they are but <hi>shadows,</hi> and
they are <hi>flying:</hi> Earthly comforts are like
<hi>Pauls</hi> friends, who brought him to the Ship,

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I shall briefly lay down some rules
or helps to godliness.</p>
               <p>1 Be diligent in the use of all means,<note place="margin">1 Rule.</note> that
may promote godliness, <hi>Luke 13. 24. strive
to enter in at the straight gate:</hi> what is <hi>purpose</hi>
without <hi>pursuit?</hi> when you have made your
estimate of godliness, prosecute those medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums
which are most expedient for obtaining
it.</p>
               <p>2 If you would be godly,<note place="margin">2 Rule.</note> take heed of
the world; 'tis hard for a clod of dust to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a star, 1 <hi>Ioh. 2. 15. love not the world:</hi>
many would be godly, but the honours and
profits of the world divert them; where the
world fills both head and heart, there is no
room for Christ; he whose minde is rooted
in the earth, is likely enough to deride god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness;
when our Saviour was preaching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
sin, <hi>the Pharisees, who were covetous, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided
him, Luk.</hi> 16. 14. The world eats out
the heart of godliness, as the lvy eats out
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:106547:152"/>
the heart of the Oak; the world kills with
her silver darts.</p>
               <p>3 Inure your selves to holy thoughts;<note place="margin">3 Rule.</note> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
meditation, represents every thing in
its native colour; it shews an evil in sin, and
a lustre in grace. By holy thoughts, the
head grows clearer, and the heart better,
<hi>Psa. 119. 59. I thought on my waies, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my feet unto thy testimonies:</hi> Did men step
aside a little out of the noise and hurry of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
and spend but half an hour every day,
in thinking upon their souls, and eternity, it
would produce a wonderful alteration in
them, and tend very much to a real and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
conversion.</p>
               <p>4 Watch your hearts;<note place="margin">4 Rule.</note> it was Christs
watch-word to his Disciples, <hi>Mat. 24. 42.
Watch therefore;</hi> the heart will praecipitate us
to sin, before we are aware; a subtil heart,
needs a watchful eye; watch your thoughts,
your affections; the heart hath a thousand
doors to run out at: O keep close sentinel in
your souls! stand continually upon your

for want of watchfulness; watchfulness main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains

religion from ravelling out.</p>
               <p>5 Make Conscience of spending your

idle visits, others in recreations and pleasures,
which secretly bewitch the heart, and take it
off from better things: What are our gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
hours for but to mind our souls? Time
mis-improved, is not time <hi>lived,</hi> but time
<hi>lost.</hi> Time is a precious commodity; a peece
of wax in it self, is not much worth, but as
it is affixed to the label of a <hi>Will,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyes
an estate, so it is of great value: Thus
<hi>time,</hi> simply in it self, is not so considerable,
but as salvation is to be wrought out in it,
and a conveyance of heaven depends upon
the well improvement of it, so it is of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
concernment.</p>
               <p>6 Think of your short stay in the world,<note place="margin">6 Rule.</note>
1 <hi>Chron. 29. 15. Our daies on the Earth are as
a shaddow, and there is none abiding.</hi> There
is but a span between the Cradle and the
Grave: <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, there is a time to bee
<hi>born,</hi> and a time to <hi>dye, Eccles.</hi> 3. 2. but
mentions no time of <hi>living,</hi> as if that were so
short, it were not worth naming; and time,
when it is once gone, cannot be recalled; the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:106547:153"/>
Scripture compares time to <hi>a flying Eagle, Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
9. 6.—yet, herein time differs from the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
the Eagle flies forward, and then back
again, but time hath wings only to fly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
it never returns back.
<q>—fugit irrevocabile tempus—</q>
               </p>
               <p>The serious thoughts of our short abode
here, would be a great means to promote
godliness; what if death should come before
we are ready? what if our life should breathe
out, before Gods spirit hath breathed in?
he that considers how flitting and winged his
life is, will hasten his repentance; when God
is about to make a short work, he will not
make a long work.</p>
               <p>7 Possess your selves with this maxim,<note place="margin">7 Rule.</note>
that godliness is the end of your Creation;
God never sent men into the world, only to
eat and drink<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and put on fine cloathes, but
that they might <hi>serve him in righteousness and
holiness, Luk.</hi> 1. 75. God made the world
only as an attiring room, to dress our souls
in; he sent us hither upon the grand errand
of godliness; should nothing but the body
(the bruitish part) bee looked after, this
were basely to degenerate, yea, to invert
and frustrate the very end of our being.</p>

<hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, the reason why the Cameli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
turns into so many colours, is through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
fear: Fear will make men change their
Religion, as often as the Camelion doth her
colour. Christian, thou who hast made a
profession of godliness so long, and others
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:106547:155"/>
have noted thee for a Saint in their Kalendar,
why dost thou fear, and begin to shrink back?
The Cause is good which thou art imbarqued
in; thou fightest against sin; thou hast a
good Captain which marcheth before thee;
Christ <hi>the Captain of thy Salvation, Heb.</hi> 2. 10.
What is it thou fearest? Is it loss of liberty?
What is liberty worth, when Conscience is in
bonds? Better lose thy liberty and keep
thy peace, than lose thy peace and keep thy
liberty: Is it loss of Estate? Dost thou say
as <hi>Amaziah, 2 Chron. 25. 9. What shall we do
for the hundred Talents?</hi> I would answer with
the Prophet, <hi>The Lord can give thee much more
than this:</hi> He hath promised thee in this life
<hi>an hundred-fold,</hi> and if that be not enough,
he will give thee <hi>life everlasting, Mat. 19.
29.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. If you would hold fast the profession
of godliness, use all means for perseverance,
1. Labour for a real work of Grace in your
soul; Grace is the best fortification, <hi>Heb.
13. 9. It is a good thing that the heart be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
with grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> What is this real work of Grace?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It consists in two things.</p>
               <p>1. It lies in an heart-humbling work: The
thorn of sin pricked <hi>Pauls</hi> Conscience, <hi>Rom.
7. 9. Sin revived, and I died.</hi> Though some
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:106547:156"/>
are less humbled than others, as some bring
forth Children with less pangs, yet all have
pangs.</p>
               <p>2 Grace lies in an heart-changing work,
1 <hi>Cor. 6. 11. But ye are washed, but ye are san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified;</hi>
A man is so changed, as if another
soul did live in the same body; if ever you
would hold out in the waies of God, get this
vital principle of grace; why do men change
their religion, but because their hearts were
never changed? they do not fall away <hi>from</hi>
grace, but for <hi>want</hi> of grace.</p>
               <p>2 If you would hold on in godliness, be
deliberate and judicious, weigh things well
in the ballance, <hi>Luke 14. 28. Which of you
intending to build a Tower, sitteth not dow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
first, and counteth the cost:</hi> Think with your selves,
what it will cost you to be godly, you
must expect the hatred of the world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.
19. the wicked hate the godly for their piety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
'tis strange they should do so; do we hate a
flower because it is sweet? the godly are
hated for the perfume of their graces; is a
Virgin hated for her beauty? the wicked hate
the godly for the beauty of holiness, which
shines in them; and secret hatred will break
forth into open violence, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 12.
Christians must count the cost before they
build; why are people so hasty in laying
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:106547:156"/>
down Religion, but because they were so
hasty in taking it up?</p>
               <p>3 If you would hold fast your profession,
get a clear distinct knowledge of God, know
the love of the Father, the merit of the
Son, the efficacy of the Holy Ghost: Such
as know not God aright, will by degrees
renounce their profession: The <hi>Samaritans</hi>
sometimes sided with the <hi>Iews,</hi> when they
were in favour, afterwards they disclaimed
all kindred with the <hi>Iews,</hi> when they were
persecuted by<note n="*" place="margin">Josephus</note> 
                  <hi>Antiochus;</hi> and no wonder
they did shuffle so in their religion, if you
consider what Christ saith of the <hi>Samaritans,
Ioh. 4. 22. Ye worship ye know not what;</hi> they
were inveloped with ignorance; blinde men
are apt to fall, so are they who are blinded
in their mindes.</p>
               <p>4 If you would persist in godliness, enter
upon it purely, out of choice, <hi>Psa. 119. 30.
I have chosen the way of truth:</hi> espouse godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for its own worth; he that would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe,
must rather choose godliness with
reproach, than sin with all its worldly pomp;
he who takes up religion for fear, will lay
it down again for fear; he who imbraceth
godliness for gain, will desert it when the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ewels of preferment are pulled off; be not
godly out of a <hi>wordly design,</hi> but <hi>a religious
choice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:106547:157"/>
5 If you would persevere in godliness, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
after integrity; this will be a golden pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
to support you; a tree that is hollow,
must needs be blown down; the hypocrite
sets up in the trade of religion, but he will
soon break, <hi>Psa. 78. 37. Their heart was not
right with him, neither were they stedfast: Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
was first a sly hypocrite, and then a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
if a peece of copper be guilded, the
guilding will wash off, nothing will hold out
but sincerity, <hi>Psa. 25. 21. Let integrity preserve
me:</hi> How many storms was <hi>Iob</hi> in? not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Satan, but God himself set against him, <hi>Iob</hi>
7. 20. which was enough to have made him
desist from being godly, yet <hi>Iob</hi> stood fast,
because he stood upright, <hi>Iob 27. 6. My
righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go,
my heart shall not reproach me, so long as I live:</hi>
those colours hold best, which are laid in
oyle; if we would have our profession hold
its colour, it must be laid in the oyl of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity.</p>
               <p>6 If you would hold out in godliness, hold
up the life and fervour of duty, <hi>Rom. 12. 1. 1.
Fervent in spirit, serving the Lord:</hi> We put
coals to the fire to keep it from going out,
when Christians grow into a dull formality,
they begin to be dis-spirited, and by degrees
abate in their godliness; none so fit to make
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:106547:157"/>
an Apostate, as a lukewarm professour.</p>
               <p>7 If you would persevere in godliness, be
much in the exercise of self-denial, <hi>Mat. 16.
24. let him deny himself,</hi> self-ease,<note n="*" place="margin">Nemo d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> displicet nisi qui si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi placet. <hi>Bernard</hi>
                  </note> self-ends;
whatever comes in competition with, or
stands in opposition to Christs glory and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
must be denied; <hi>Self</hi> is the great snare,
self-love undermines the power of godliness.
The young man in the Gospel, might have
followed Christ, but that something of self
<note n="*" place="margin">Nemo lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur nisi a se ipso.</note>hindered, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 20, 22. Self-love, is
self hatred, he will never get to heaven,
that cannot get beyond himself.</p>
               <p>8 If you would hold on in godliness, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
an holy jealousie over your hearts,
<hi>Rom. 11. 20. Be not high-minded, but fear:</hi>
he that hath Gun powder in his house, fears
lest it should catch fire; sin in the heart is
like Gun-powder, it may make us fear, lest
a sparkle of temptation falling upon us,
should blow us up: There are two things
may make us alwaies jealous of our hearts;
the <hi>deceits</hi> of our hearts, and the <hi>lusts</hi> of our
hearts: When <hi>Peter</hi> was afraid hee should
sink, and cried to Christ, <hi>Lord save me,</hi> then
Christ took him by the hand and helped
him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 31. but when <hi>Peter</hi> grew con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
and thought he could stand alone,
then Christ suffered him to fall. Oh let us
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:106547:158"/>
be suspitious of our selves, and in an holy
sense, <hi>cloathe our selves with trembling, Eze.</hi>
26. 16.</p>
               <p>9 If you would continue your progress
in godliness, labour for assurance, 2 <hi>Pet. 1.
10. Give diligence to make your calling and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
sure:</hi> He who is sure God is his God,
is like a Castle built upon a rock, all the
powers of Hell cannot shake him: How can
he be constant in religion, who is at a loss a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his spiritual estate, and knows not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he hath grace or no? it will be a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
matter for him to dye for Christ, who
doth not know that Christ hath died for
him; assurance establisheth a Christian in sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
times; he is the likeliest to bear witness
to the truth, who hath the spirit of God
bearing witness to his heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16.
Oh <hi>give diligence!</hi> be much in prayer, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
holy conference; these are the oyle,
without which the lamp of assurance will not
shine.</p>
               <p>10 If you would hold out in godliness,
lay hold of Gods strength; God is called <hi>the
strength of</hi> Israel, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 29. It is in his
strength we stand, more than our own; the
childe is safest in the Nurses hands; it is not
our holding God, but his holding us, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
us; a little pinnace tyed fast to a rock,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:106547:158"/>
is safe, so are we, when we are tyed to the <hi>rock
of ages.</hi>

               <p>THat I may excite Christians to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere

               <p>1 It is the glory and Crown of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
to be gray-headed in godliness, <hi>Act. 21.
16. Mnason of Cyprus, an old Disciple:</hi> What
an honour is it to see a Christians garments
red with blood, yet his conscience pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

white, and his graces green and flourishing?</p>
               <p>2 How do sinners persevere in their sins,
they are <hi>setled on their lees, Zeph.</hi> 1. 12. The
judgements of God will not deter or remove
them; they say to their sin, as <hi>Ruth</hi> to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omi,
Ruth 1. 16. Where thou goest, I will go,
the Lord do so to me, and more, if ought but
death part thee and me;</hi> so nothing shall part
between men and their sins; Oh! what a
shame is it, that the wicked should be fixed
in evil, and we unfixed in good? that they
should be more constant in the Devils ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:106547:159"/>
than we are in Christs.</p>
               <p>3 Our perseverance in godliness, may be
a means to confirm others; <hi>Cyprians</hi> hearers

and seeing his stedfastness in the faith,<note place="margin">

               <p>

               <p>The fourth promise is, <hi>Rev. 3. 5. he that

who hath owned Christ on earth, and worn
his colours, when it was death to wear them,
Christ will not bee ashamed of him, but will
confess his Name before his Father, and the

will it be to have a good look from Christ at

               </p>
               <p>The fifth promise is, Rev. 3. 12. <hi>Him that
overcometh will I make a Pillar in the Temple of
my God, and he shall goe no more out, and I
will write upon him the Name of my God, and
the Name of the City of my God.</hi> Here are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

I will make him a <hi>Pillar</hi> in the Temple of my
God; The Hypocrite is <hi>calamus,</hi> a <hi>Reed sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

this of a glorified state, <hi>Hee shall go no
more out;</hi> that is, after he hath overcome,
hee shall go no more out to the Wars; hee
shall never have sin or temptation more to
conflict with, no more noyse of Drum, or
Cannon shall bee heard, but the Believer
having won the field, hee shall now stay at
home, and divide the spoil. <hi>And I will
write upon him the Name of my God.</hi> That is,
he shall bee openly acknowledged for my
Childe; as the Son bears his Fathers Name.
How honourable must that Saint bee who
hath Gods own Name written upon him!
<hi>And I will write upon him, the Name of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                  <hi>Doct.</hi> That a little grace mixed with much
corruption, shall not be quenched. For the
illustrating of this, I shall show you</p>
               <p>1. That often a little grace is mixed with
much corruption.</p>
               <p>2. That this little grace interlined with
corruption, shall not be quenched.</p>
               <p>3. The Reasons of the Proposition.</p>
               <p>1. Often in the godly a little grace is min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
with much corruption, <hi>Mark 9. 24. Lord
I believe,</hi> there was some Faith; <hi>help my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief;</hi>
there was corruption mixed with it:
There are in the best Saints interweavings of
sin and grace; a dark side with the light:
much pride mixed with humility, much
earthliness with heavenliness: Grace in the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:106547:169"/>
godly doth relish of an old Crabtree stock.</p>
               <p>Nay, in many of the Regenerate there is
more corruption than grace, so much smoak
that you can scarce discern any fire, so much
distrust, that you can hardly see any<note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 27. 1.</note> Faith,
so much passion, that you can hardly see any
meekness. <hi>Ionah</hi> a peevish Prophet, he quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
with God; nay, he justifies his passion,
<hi>Ionah 4. 9. I do well to be angry to the death.</hi>
Here was so much passion, that it was hard to
see any grace. A Christian in this life, is like
a glass that hath more froth than wine; or
like a diseased body, that hath more <hi>humours</hi>
than <hi>spirits:</hi> This may humble the best, to
consider how much corruption is interlarded
with their grace.</p>
               <p>2. This little grace mixed with much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
shall not be quenched: <hi>The smoaking
flax he will not quench:</hi> The Disciples Faith
was at first but small, <hi>they forsook Christ and</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 26. 56.</note>
                  <hi>fled.</hi> Here was <hi>smoaking flax,</hi> but Chirst
did not quench that little grace, but cherish
and animate it; their Faith afterwards grew
stronger, and they did openly confess<note n="†" place="margin">Acts 4. 29. 30.</note>
Christ. Here was <hi>the flax flaming.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The Reasons why Christ will not
quench the smoaking flax.</p>
               <p>1. Because this <hi>Scintilla,</hi> this little light
which is in the smoaking flax is of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:106547:169"/>
it comes from the <hi>Father of Lights,</hi>
and the Lord will not quench the work of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
own grace: Every thing by the instinct of
Nature will preserve its<note n="*" place="margin">Omne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens est ful conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivum.</note> own: The Hen
that hatcheth her young, will preserve and
cherish them, she will not destroy them as
soon as they are hatched: God who hath
put this tenderness into the Creature to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
its young, will much more cherish the
work of his own spirit in the heart: Will he
light up the Lamp of Grace in the soul, and
then put it out? This would be neither for
his interest nor honor.</p>
               <p>2. Christ will not quench the beginnings
of grace, because a little grace is precious as
well as more: A small Pearl is of value:
Though the Pearl of Faith be little, yet if
it be a true Pearl it shines gloriously in Gods
eyes: A Goldsmith makes reckoning of the
least filings of gold, and will not throw them
away: The <hi>pupilla oculi,</hi> the apple of the eye,
is but little, yet of great use, it can at once
view an huge part of the heavens: A little
Faith can justifie; a weak hand can tye the
Nuptial Knot; a weak Faith can unite to
Christ as well as a strong; a little grace
makes us like God; a silver penny bears the
Kings Image upon it as well as a larger piece
of Coyn: The least dram of grace bears
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:106547:170"/>
Gods Image on it, and will God destroy his
own Image? When the Temples in <hi>Greece</hi>
were demolished, <hi>Xerxes</hi> caused the Temple
of <hi>Diana</hi> to be preserved for the beauty of
its structure: When God shall destroy all
the glory of the world, and set it on fire,
yet he will not destroy the least grace because
it bears a print of his own likeness upon it:
That little spark in the smoaking flax is a ray
and beam of Gods own glory.</p>
               <p>3. Christ will not quench the smoaking
flax, because this little light in the flax may
grow bigger: Grace is resembled to a grain
of Mustard-seed, of all seeds it is the least,
but <hi>when it is grown, it is the greatest among
herbs, and becometh a Tree, Mat.</hi> 13. 32. The
greatest grace was once little; the Oak was
once an Acorn; the most Renowned Faith
in the world was once in its Spiritual Infancy;
the greatest flame of zeal was once but
smoaking flax: Grace, like <hi>the waters of the
Sanctuary,</hi> riseth higher: If then the least
Embryo and seed of holiness be of a ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and growing nature, the Lord will not
suffer it to be abortive.</p>
               <p>4. Christ will not quench the smoaking
flax, because when he preserves a little light
in a great deal of smoak, here the glory of
his power shines forth: The trembling soul
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:106547:170"/>
thinks it shall be swallowed up of sin, but
God by preserving a little quantity of grace
in the heart, nay, by making that spark pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
over corruption, as the <hi>fire</hi> from heaven
<hi>licked up the water in the trench, 1 King.</hi> 18. 38.
Now, God gets himself a glorious Name,
and carries away the Trophies of Honor,
2 <hi>Cor. 12. 9. My strength is made perfect in
weakness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. See the different dealings of God and
men,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> men for a little smoak will quench a great
deal of light;<note place="margin">Inform.</note> God for a great deal of smoak
will not quench a little light:<note place="margin">1 Bran.</note> 'Tis the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the world, if they see a little failing
in another, for that failing they will pass by
and quench a great deal of worth: This is
our nature, to aggravate a little fault, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish
a great deal of virtue; to see the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
and darken the excellencies of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
as we take more notice of the <hi>twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
of a Star, than the <hi>shining</hi> of a Star: We
censure others for their passion, but do not
admire them for their piety. Thus for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
smoak that we see in others, we quench
much light.</p>
               <p>God doth not thus, for a great deal of
smoak he will not quench a little light; he
sees the sincerity, and over-looks many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
the least sparks of grace he che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:106547:171"/>
and blows them gently with the
breath of his spirit, till they break forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a flame.</p>
               <p>—2 If Christ will not quench the smoaking
flax,<note place="margin">2 Bran.</note> then we must not quench the smoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
flax in our selves; if grace doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
into so great a flame as we see in others,
therefore to conclude we have no fire of the
spirit in us, this is to quench the smoaking
flax, and to bear false witness against our
selves; as we must not credit a false evidence,
so neither must we deny a true; fire may be
hid in the embers, so may grace be hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
many distempers of soul; some Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
are so skilful at this, in accusing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for want of grace, as if they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a fee from Satan, to plead for him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
themselves.</p>
               <p>This is a great mistake, to argue from
the weakness of grace, to the nullity; it is
one thing to be wanting in faith, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing to want faith; he whose eye-sight
is dim, is wanting in his sight, but he doth
not want sight; a little grace is grace, though
it be smothered under much corruption.</p>
               <p>3 If the least spark of grace shall not bee
quenched, then this follows as a great truth,
that there is no falling from<note n="*" place="margin">Fides ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stificans se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel habita, non potest in totum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitti.</note> grace; if the
least dram of grace should perish, then the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:106547:171"/>
smoaking flax should be quenched; grace may
be shaken by fears and doubtings, but not
blown up by the<note n="*" place="margin">Gratia concutitur non excuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                  </note> roots: I grant, seeming
grace may be lost, this wilde-fire may be
blown out, but not the fire of the Spirits
kindling; Grace may be <hi>dormant</hi> in the soul,
but not dead, as a man in an Appoplexy,
doth not put forth vital operations: Grace
may be eclipsed, not extinct, a Christian
may lose his comfort, like a tree in <hi>Autumn,</hi>
that hath shed its fruit, but still there is sap
in the vine, and <hi>the seed of God remains, 1 Ioh.</hi>
3. 9. Grace is a flower of eternity.</p>
               <p>This smoaking flax cannot be quenched
by affliction, but like those trees, <hi>Pliny</hi>
writes of, growing in the red Sea, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beaten upon by the waves, stand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moovable,
and though they are sometimes
covered with water, flourish the more; grace
is like a true orient Diamond, that sparkles,
and cannot be broken.</p>
               <p>I confesse it is matter of wonder, that
grace should not be wholly annihilated, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if we consider two things.</p>
               <p>1 The malice of Satan, he is a malignant
spirit, and laies bars in our way to heaven;
the Devil with the wind of temptation, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to blow out the spark of grace in our
hearts; if this will not do, he stirs up wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:106547:172"/>
men, and raiseth the Militia of Hell against
us: what a wonder is it, that this bright
Star of grace, should not be swept down
with the tail of the Dragon?</p>
               <p>2 It is an amazing thing, that grace should
subsist, if we consider the world of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in our hearts; sin makes the major part
in a Christian; there is in the best heart
more dregs than spirits. The heart swarms
with sin; what a deal of pride and Atheism is
in the soul? now is it not admirable, that
this Lilly of grace, should be able to grow
among so many thorns? it is as great a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that a little grace, should be preserved
in the midst of so much corruption, as to see
a Taper burning in the Sea, and not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished.</p>
               <p>But though grace lives with so much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
as the infant that struggles for
breath, yet being born of God it is immortal,
grace conflicting with corruption, is like a
Ship tossed and beaten with the waves, yet
it weathers out the storm, and at last gets to
the desired Haven. If grace should expire,
how could this Text be verified, <hi>The smoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
flax he will not quench.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But whence is it, that grace, even
the least degree of it, should not be quenched?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is from the mighty operation of
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:106547:172"/>
the Holy Ghost; the Spirit of God, who is
<hi>origo originans,</hi> doth continually excite and
quicken grace in the heart: He is every day
at work in a believer; he powres in oyl, and
keeps the Lamp of Grace burning: Grace
is compared to a river of life, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 38. The
river of grace can never be dri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Spirit of God is the Spring which feeds it.</p>
               <p>Now that the smoaking flax cannot be
quenched, is evident from the Covenant of
Grace, <hi>Isa. 54. 10. The Mountains shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,

The Covenant of Grace is called, <hi>A

               <p>From all that hath been said, let a Saint of
the Lord be perswaded to these two things,
<list>
                     <item>1. To believe his priviledge.</item>
                     <item>2. To pursue his duty.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. To believe his priviledge: This is the
incomparable and unparallel'd happiness of a
Saint, that his <hi>coal shall not be</hi>

                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:106547:173"/>
That grace in his soul, which is minute at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
languid, shall not give up the Ghost, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
its strength, and <hi>encrease with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of God:</hi> The Lord will make the
smoaking flax a burning lamp: It were very
sad, that a Christian should be continually
upon the Tropicks, one day a member of
Christ, and the next day a limb of Satan;
one day to have grace shine in his soul, and
the next day his light put out in obscurity:
This would spill a Christians comfort, and
break asunder the golden Chain of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but be assured, O Christian, he who
hath begun a good work, will ripen it into
perfection: Christ will <hi>send forth judgement
unto victory;</hi> he will make grace victorious
over all opposite corruption: If grace should
finally perish, what would become of the
<hi>smoaking flax?</hi> And how would that title
properly be given to Christ, <hi>Finisher of the</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note>
                  <hi>Faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> No question this is an undoubted
priviledge to such as are smoaking flax, and
have the least beginnings of grace, but I fear I
am not <hi>smoaking flax,</hi> I cannot see the light of
grace in my self?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That I may comfort the smoaking
flax, why dost thou thus dispute against thy
self? What makes thee think thou hast no
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:106547:174"/>
grace? I believe thou hast more than thou
wouldst be willing to part with; thou valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
grace above the gold of <hi>Ophir:</hi> How
couldst thou see the worth and lustre of this
Jewel, if Gods Spirit had not opened thy
eyes? Thou wouldst fain believe, and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
that thou canst not believe, are not
these tears the Initials of Faith? Thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirest
Christ, and canst not be satisfied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him; this beating of the pulse eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
life: The iron could not move upward,
if the Loadstone did not draw it; the heart
could not ascend in holy breathings after
God, if some heavenly Loadstone had not
been drawing it. Christian, canst thou say
sin is thy burden, Christ is thy delight? and
as <hi>Peter</hi> once said, <hi>Lord, thou knowest I love
thee:</hi> This is <hi>smoaking flax,</hi> and the Lord will
not quench it; thy grace shall flourish into
glory; God will sooner extinguish the light
of the Sun, than extinguish the dawning
light of his spirit in thy heart.</p>
               <p>2. Let a Christian pursue his duty: There
are two duties required of believers,
<list>
                     <item>1. Love.</item>
                     <item>2. Labour.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>Love.</hi> Will not the Lord quench the
smoaking flax, but make it at last victorious
over all opposition? how should the smoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:106547:174"/>
flax flame in love to God? <hi>Psal. 31. 23.
love the Lord all ye his Saints:</hi> The Saints
owe much to God, and when they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to pay, it is hard if they cannot love
him: O ye Saints, it is God who carries on
grace progressively in your souls: He is like
a Father who gives his son a small stock of
money to begin with, and when he hath tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a little, he adds more to the stock: So
God adds continually to your stock, he is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day dropping oyl into the lamp of your
grace, and so keeps the lamp burning: This
may inflame your love to God, who will not
let the work of grace miscarry, but will bring
it to perfection: <hi>The smoaking flax he will not
quench:</hi> How should Gods people long for
heaven, when it will be their constant work,
to breathe forth love, and found forth praise?</p>
               <p>2. The second duty required of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
is <hi>labour:</hi> Some may think if Christ will
not quench the smoaking flax, but make it
burn brighter to the Meridian of glory, then
we need take no pains, but leave God to
bring his own work about. Take heed of
drawing so bad a Conclusion from such good
premises: What I have spoken, is to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
Faith, not to indulge sloath: Do not
think God will do our work for us, and we
sit still: As God will blow up the spark of
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:106547:175"/>
grace by his spirit, so we must be blowing it
up by holy endeavours: God will not bring
us to heaven <hi>sleeping,</hi> but <hi>praying:</hi> The Lord
told <hi>Paul,</hi> all in the Ship should come safe to
shore, but it must be in the use of means, <hi>Act.
27. 21. Except ye abide in the Ship, ye cannot
be saved.</hi> So the Saints shall certainly arrive
at Salvation, they shall come to shore at last,
but they must <hi>abide in the Ship,</hi> in the use of
Ordinances, else they cannot be saved: Christ
assures his Disciples, <hi>None shall pluck them out
of his hand, Ioh.</hi> 10. 28. But yet he gives
that counsel, <hi>Watch and pray, that ye enter not
into temptation, Mat,</hi> 26. 41. The seed of
God shall not die, but we must water it with
our tears; the smoaking flax shall not be
quenched, but we must blow it up with the
breath of our endeavour.</p>
               <p>The second comfort to the godly,<note place="margin">2 Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> is that
godliness advanceth them into a near and
glorious union with Jesus Christ: But of
this in the next.</p>

                  <hi>Doct.</hi> That there is a conjugal union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Christ and beleevers.</p>
               <p>The Apostle having treated at large of
marriage, he windes up the whole chapter
thus, <hi>Eph. 5. 32. This is a great mystery, but
I speak concerning Christ and the Church:</hi>
what nearer than union? what sweeter? there
is a twofold union with Christ,</p>
               <p>1 A natural union; this all men have,
Christ having taken their nature upon him,
and not the Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 16. but if there
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:106547:176"/>
be no more, than this natural union, it will
give little comfort; thousands are damned,
though Christ be united to their nature.</p>
               <p>2 There is a sacred union, whereby we
are mystically united to Christ; the union
with Christ is not <hi>personal;</hi> if Christs essence
were transfused into the person of a beleever,
then it would follow, that all which a beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
doth, should merit.</p>
               <p>But the union between Christ and a Saint,
is,</p>

                  <hi>my beloved is mine;</hi> God
the Father gives the bride, God the Son
receives the bride, God the Holy ghost
tyes the knot in marriage; he knits our wills
to Christ, and Christs love to us.</p>
               <p>2 This union is vertual; Christ unites himself
to his spouse, by his graces and influences,
<hi>Iohn 1. 16. Of his fulness have we all received,
and grace for grace:</hi> Christ makes himself one
with the spouse, by conveying his Image,
and stamping the impress of his own holiness
upon her.</p>
               <p>This union with Christ, may well be
called <hi>mystical,</hi> it is hard to describe the
manner of it; as it is hard to shew the manner
how the soul is united to the body, so how
Christ is united to the soul; but though this
union be spiritual, it is real: Things in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:106547:176"/>
work often insensibly, yet really, <hi>Eccles.</hi>
11. 5. we do not see the hand move on the
Dial, yet it moves; the Sun exhales and
draws up the vapours of the earth insensibly,
yet really; so the union between Christ and
the soul, though it be imperceptible to the
eye of reason, yet is real, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17.</p>
               <p>Before this union with Christ, there must
be a separation; the heart must be separated
from all other lovers; as in marriage there is
a leaving of Father and Mother, <hi>Psa. 45. 10.
Forget also thine own people, and thy Fathers
house;</hi> So there must be a leaving of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
sins, a breaking off the old league with
hell, before wee can bee united to Christ,
<hi>Hos. 14. 8. Ephraim shall say, what have I to
do any more with Idols?</hi> or as it is in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
with <hi>sorrows:</hi>

                  </note> Those sins which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were looked upon as <hi>lovers,</hi> now they
are <hi>sorrows;</hi> there must be a divorce, before
an union.</p>
               <p>The end of our conjugal union with Christ
is twofold.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Co-habitation;</hi> this is one end of marriage,
to live together, <hi>Ephes. 3. 17. That Christ
may dwell in your hearts;</hi> it is not enough to
give Christ a few complemental visits in his
ordinances, hypocrites may do so; but there
must be a mutual associating; we must dwell
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:106547:177"/>
upon the thoughts of Christ, 1 <hi>Iohn 3. 24.
he that dwelleth in God;</hi> married persons should
not live asunder.</p>

                  </gap> married to another, even to him who is raised
from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit
unto God: <hi>the Spouse brings forth the</hi> fruits
<hi>of the spirit,</hi> love, joy, peace, long-suffering,
gentleness, Gal. 5. 22. <hi>Barrenness is a shame
in Christs spouse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This marriage-union with Christ, is the
most noble and excellent union.</p>
               <p>1 Christ unites himself to many; in other
marriages there is but a person taken, but
here millions are taken; alas, else poor souls
might cry out, Christ hath married himself
to such an ones person, but what is that to
me? I am left out; no, Christ marries him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to thousands; 'tis <hi>casta polygamia,</hi> an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and chaste polygamy; multitudes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
doth not defile this marriage-bed; no
poor sinner, but bringing an humble beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heart, may be married to Christ.</p>
               <p>2 In this holy marriage, is a nearer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
than can be in any other, in other
marriages, two make <hi>one flesh,</hi> but Christ
and the beleever make one spirit, 1 <hi>Cor. 6.
17. He that is joyned to the Lord, is one spirit:</hi>
now as the soul is more excellent than the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:106547:177"/>
body, and admits of far greater joy; so this
spiritual union, brings in more astonishing
delights and ravishments, than any other
marriage-relation is capable of; the joy that
flows from the mystical union, is <hi>unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and full of glory, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
               <p>3 This union with Christ never ceaseth.

                  <hi>Hos. 2. 19. I will betroth thee unto me
for ever:</hi> to speak properly, our marriage
with Christ begins, where other marriages
end, at death.</p>
               <p>In this life is but the contract; the <hi>Iews</hi>
had a time set between their espousals and
marriage, sometimes a year, or more: in
this life is but the affiancing and contract, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
are made on both sides, and love pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
secretly between Christ and the soul;
he gives some smiles of his face, and the
soul sends up her sighs, and drops tears of
love: But all this is but a praevious work,
and something tending to the marriage, the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:106547:178"/>
glorious compleating and solemnizing of the
Nuptials, is reserved for heaven; there is
the marriage-supper of the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.
9. and the Bed of glory perfumed with love,
where the souls of the elect shall be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
solacing themselves, 1 <hi>Thes. 4. 17. then
shall we ever be with the Lord;</hi> so that death
doth but begin our marriage with Christ.</p>

usurps this prerogative, to be <hi>Ecclesiae caput,</hi>

Christs marriage-bed; what blasphemy is
this? two heads is monstrous; Christ is

               <p>2 Have we consented to the match? 'tis
not enough that Christ is willing to have us,
but are we willing to have him? God doth
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:106547:178"/>
not so force salvation upon us, as that wee
shall have Christ whether wee will or no;
we must consent to have him; many approve
of Christ, but do not give their consent: and
this consent must be,</p>
               <p>1 Pure and genuine, we consent to have
him for his own worth and excellency, <hi>Psa.
45. 2. Thou art fairer, than the Children of
men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 It must be a present consent, 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 2.
now is the accepted time;</hi> if we put Christ off
with delayes and excuses, perhaps he will
come no more, he will leave off wooing, <hi>his
spirit shall no longer strive,</hi> and then poor fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
what wilt thou do? when Gods wooing
ends, thy woes begin.</p>
               <p>3 Have we taken Christ, faith is <hi>vincu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum

is joyned to us by his spirit, and we are joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

a consulting and projecting how to carry on
the work of our Salvation; he transacts all
our affairs, he minds our business as his own;
indeed he himself is concerned in it; he
brings in fresh supplies to his Spouse; if she
wanders out of the way, he guides her; if
she stumble, he holds her by the hand, if
she falls, he raiseth her; if she be dull, he
quickens her by his spirit, if she be fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
he draws her with cords of love; if
she be sad, he comforts her with promises.</p>
               <p>2. For <hi>ardent affection:</hi> No Husband like
Christ for love: The Lord saith to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>I have loved you;</hi> and they say, <hi>Wherein
hast thou loved us? Mal.</hi> 1. 2. But we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
say to Christ, wherein hast thou loved
us? Christ hath given real Demonstrations
of his love to his Spouse: He hath sent her
his <hi>Word,</hi> which is a Love-letter; and he hath
given her his <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is a Love-token:
Christ loves more than any other Husband.</p>
               <p>1. Christ puts upon his Bride a richer
Robe, <hi>Isa. 61. 10. He hath cloathed me with
the garments of Salvation, he hath covered me
with the Robe of Righteousness.</hi> In this Robe
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:106547:180"/>
God looks upon us as if we had not sinned:
This is as truly ours to justifie, as it is Christs
to bestow: this Robe doth not only <hi>cover,</hi>
but <hi>adorn:</hi> Having on this Robe we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
righteous, not only as Angels, but as
Christ, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 21. That we might be made
the righteousness of God in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Christ gives his Bride, not only his
Golden Garments, but his Image: He loves
her into his own likeness: An Husband may
bear a dear affection to his Wife, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
stamp his own Effigies upon her; if she
be deformed, he may give her a Vail to hide
it, but he cannot put his beauty upon her:
But Christ imparts <hi>the beauty of holiness</hi> to
his Spouse, <hi>Ezek. 16. 14. Thou wert comely
through my comeliness.</hi> When Christ marries
a soul, he makes it fair, <hi>Cant. 4. 7. Thou art
all fair my Spouse.</hi> Christ never thinks he
hath loved his Spouse enough, till he can see
his own face in her.</p>
               <p>3. Christ dischargeth those debts which
no other Husband can: Our sins are the worst
debts we owe, (if all the Angels should go to
make a Purse, they could not pay one of these
debts) but Christ frees us from these; he is
both an <hi>Husband</hi> and a <hi>Surety;</hi> he saith to
Justice, as <hi>Paul</hi> concerning <hi>Onesimus, If he
ows thee any thing, put it upon my score, I will
repay it, Philem.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:106547:180"/>
4. Christ hath suffered more for his
Spouse, than ever any Husband did for a
Wife; he suffered poverty and ignominy:
He who crowned the heavens with <hi>stars,</hi> was
himself crowned with<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>thorns:</hi> He was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a companion of sinners, that we might
be made companions of Angels; he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardless
of his life; he leaped into the Sea
of his Fathers wrath to save his Spouse from
drowning.</p>
               <p>5. Christs love doth not end with his
life. He loves his Spouse for ever, <hi>Hos. 2.
19. I will betroath thee unto me for ever.</hi> Well
may the Apostle call it, <hi>a love that passeth
knowledge, Eph.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
               <p>3. See how rich believers are,<note place="margin">3 Infer.</note> they are
matched into the Crown of Heaven, and by
virtue of the Conjugal Union all Christs
riches go to believers, <hi>Communion is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Union.</hi> Christ communicates his <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Iohn</hi> 1. 16. As long as Christ hath it,
believers shall not want; and he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
his <hi>Priviledges,</hi> Justification, Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
He settles a Kingdome upon his Spouse
for her Joynture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28. This is a Key
to the Apostles Riddle, 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 10. As
having nothing, yet possessing all.</hi> By virtue
of the Marriage-Union, the Saints are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested
in all Christs riches.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:106547:181"/>
4 See how fearful a Sin it is to abuse the
Saints;<note place="margin">4. Infer.</note> it is an injury done to Christ, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
are mystically one with him, <hi>Act. 9.
4. Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me;</hi> when
the body was wounded, the head being in
heaven cryed out; in this sense men <hi>crucifie</hi>
Christ afresh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 6. because what is
done to his members, is done to him; if <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon</hi>
was avenged upon those who slew his
brethren, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 8. 21. will not Christ much
more bee avenged upon those that wrong
his Spouse? Will a King endure to have his
Treasure rifled? his Crown thrown in the
dust? his Queen beheaded? will Christ
bear with the affronts and injuries done to
his Bride? the Saints are <hi>the apple of Christs
eye, Zac.</hi> 2. 8. and they that strike at his eye,
let them answer it, <hi>Isa. 49. 26. I will feed
them that oppress thee with their own flesh, and
they shall be drunken with their own blood, as
with sweet wine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5 See the reason why the Saints do so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in the Word and Sacrament,<note place="margin">5. Infer.</note> because
here they meet with their Husband Christ;
the Wife desires to be in the presence of her
Husband: The Ordinances are the chariot in
which Christ rides, the lattice through which
he looks forth and shews his smiling face;
here Christ <hi>displaies the banner of love. Can.
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:106547:181"/>
                  </hi>
2. 4. The Lords Supper is nothing else but
a pledge and earnest of that eternal commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
the Saints shall have with Christ in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
Then he will take the Spouse into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some;
if Christ be so sweet in an Ordinance,
when we have but short glances, and dark
glimpses of him by saith, Oh then, how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
and ravishing will his presence be in
heaven, when we shall see him <hi>face to face,</hi>
and be for ever in his loving embraces?</p>
               <p>4 This mystical union affords much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to beleevers,<note place="margin">Vse 4. Consol.</note> in several cases.</p>
               <p>1 In case of the dis-respects and unkinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of the world, <hi>Psa. 55. 3. In wrath
they hate mee:</hi> but though we live in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
world, wee have a kinde Husband,
<hi>Ioh. 15. 9. As the father hath loved me, so
have I loved you:</hi> What Angel can tell how
God the Father loves Christ? yet the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
love to Christ, is made the copy and
pattern of Christs love to his Spouse; this
love of Christ, as far exceeds all created
love, as the Sun out shines the light of a
Torch; and is not this matter of comfort?
what though the world hates me, yet Christ
loves me.</p>
               <p>2 It is comfort in case of weakness of
grace; the beleever cannot lay hold upon
Christ, but with a trembling hand; there
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:106547:182"/>
is a <hi>spirit of infirmity</hi> upon him, but O weak
Christian! here is strong consolation; there
is a <hi>conjugal union,</hi> thou art the Spouse of
Christ, and hee will bear with thee as the
<hi>weaker vessel:</hi> will an Husband divorce his
Wife, because she is weak and sickly? no he
will be the more tender of her; Christ hates
treachery, but he will pity infirmity; when
the spouse is faint, and ready to be discourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Christ puts his <hi>left hand under her head

at the day of Judgement: There is a

Judge; what though the Devil bring in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

thy sins in his blood; he will say, shall

is this? the Husband is Judge: Christ can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pass the sentence against his spouse, but
hee must pass it against himself, for Christ
and beleevers are one.</p>
               <p>5 It is comfort in case of the Saints suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings;
The Church of God is exposed
in this life to many injuries, but she hath an

               <p>Christ will comfort his spouse after the

               <p>5. Let me press several duties upon such
as have this Marriage-Union with Christ.<note place="margin">Vse 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>1. Make use of this Relation;<note place="margin">1 Duty.</note> in two
cases.</p>
               <p>1. When the Law brings in its Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
against you; here are, saith the Law,
so many debts to be paid, and it demands sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction;
acknowledge the debt, but turn
over all to your Husband Christ: 'Tis a
Maxim in Law, that the suit must not go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the wife as long as the Husband is<note n="*" place="margin">Uxori lis no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur.</note> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving:
Tell Satan when he accuseth thee, 'tis
true the debt is mine, but go to my Husband
Christ, he will discharge it: Would we take
this course, we might ease our selves of much
trouble; by Faith we turn over the debt to
our Husband: Believers are not in a state of
Widdow-hood, but Marriage: Satan will
never go to Christ, he knows Justice is satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Debt-book cancell'd, but he
comes to us for the debt that he may perplex
us, we should send him to Christ, and then
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:106547:183"/>
all Law-suits would cease: This is a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Triumph, when he is in himself guilty,
in Christ he is worthy, when he is spotted in
himself, he is pure in his head.</p>
               <p>2. In case of desertion: Christ may (for
ends best known to himself) step aside for a
time; <hi>Cant. 5. 6. My beloved had withdrawn
himself;</hi> say not therefore Christ is quite
gone: 'Tis a fruit of jealousie in a Wife,
when her Husband hath left her a while, to
think he is quite gone from her: Upon every
removal out of sight, for us to say (as <hi>Sion)
The Lord hath forsaken me, Isa.</hi> 49. 14. This
is jealousie, and it is a wrong done to the
love of Christ, and the sweetness of this
Marriage-Relation: Christ may forsake his
Spouse in regard of comfort, but he will
not forsake her in regard of union: An Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
may be a thousand miles distant from
his Wife, but still he is an Husband: Christ
may leave his Spouse, but still the Marriage
Knot holds.</p>

                  <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 5.
love him, though he be reproached and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted:
A Wife loves her Husband when in
prison: To inflame your love towards Christ,
consider, 1. Nothing else is fit for you to
love: If Christ be your Husband, it is not
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:106547:184"/>
fit to have other Lovers, that would make
Christ grow jealous. 2. He is worthy of
your love; he is of unparallel'd beauty, <hi>Cant.
5. 10. altogether lovely.</hi> 3. How pregnant is
Christs love towards you? he loves you in
your worst condition, he loves you in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
The Goldsmith loves his gold in the
Furnace: he loves you notwithstanding your
scars and blemishes: The Saints infirmities
cannot wholly take off Christs love from
them, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 1. Oh then how should the
Spouse be endeared in her love to Christ!
This will be the excellency of Heaven, our
love will then be as the Sun in its full
strength.</p>

Christ honoured you to take you into the
Marriage-Relation, and make you one with
himself? this calls for joy: By virtue of the
Union, believers go sharers with Christ in his
riches. It was a custome among the <hi>Romans,</hi>
when the Wife was brought home, she recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Keys of her husbands house, intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
that the treasure and custody of the
house was now committed to her: When
Christ shall bring his Bride home to those
glorious Mansions which he is gone before to
Prepare for her, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 2. He will deliver
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:106547:184"/>
up the keys of his treasure to her, and she
shall be as rich as heaven can make her; and
shall not the Spouse rejoyce, and <hi>sing aloud
upon her bed? Psal.</hi> 149. 5. Christians, let
the times be never so sad, you may rejoyce
in your spiritual Espousals, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 17. Let
me tell you, it is a sin not to rejoyce; you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparage
your Husband Christ. When a wife
is always sighing and weeping, what will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
say, This woman hath a bad husband:
Is this the fruit of Christs love to you, to
reflect dishonor upon him? A melancholly
spouse sads Christs heart: I deny not but a
Christian should grieve for sins of daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursion,
but to be always weeping (as if he
mourned without hope) is dishonourable to
the Marriage-Relation, <hi>Phil. 4. 4. Rejoyce in
the Lord always.</hi> Rejoycing doth credit your
husband; Christ loves a chearful Bride; and
indeed the very end of Gods making us sad,
is to make us rejoyce; we <hi>sow in tears,</hi> that
we may <hi>reap in joy:</hi> The excessive sadness and
contristation of the godly, will make others
afraid to imbrace Christ, they will begin to
question whether there be that satisfactory
joy in Religion as is pretended: Oh yee
Saints of God <hi>forget not consolation,</hi> let others
see that you repent not of your choice; 'tis
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:106547:185"/>
joy that puts liveliness and activity into a
Christian, <hi>Nehem. 8. 10. The ioy of the
Lord is your strength.</hi> Then the soul is swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
in duty, when it is carried upon the wings
of joy.</p>
               <p>4. Adorn this Marriage-Relation,<note place="margin">4 Duty.</note> that you
may be a crown to your husband. 1. Wear a
vail. We read of the spouses vail, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 7.
This vail is humility. 2. Put on your Jewels.
