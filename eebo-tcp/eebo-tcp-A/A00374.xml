            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

crueltie, rather to defende them, then to pyll or pol them.

               <p>Now though Prynces make many lawes wherof Chriſt is not the authou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re, yet as they are to be obeyed whan they commaunde that which isiuſt and right, ſo is it beſt to ſuffre them euen whan they be euell.

Therfore he that is called to more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellentie of giftes, ought (after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the higheſt elementes) to drawe other vnto him, and to helpe that his in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feriours maye be tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſfourmed in to his nature: and not vnder the pretence and cloke of vertue to diſagree from the ler<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nynge of Chriſt, who is the onely mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke which euery man ought to ſhote at, and in no wyſe to chaunge it, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force himſelfe to come as nye it as he can.

For we muſt for ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke Egypte, that we turne not agayne to the fleſh portes therof: So haiſt out of Sodome, that we loke not back: So fiee out of Babylon and from the vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces therof, that we do it ſpedely wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout prolonginge of the tyme: that we truſt no longer to our ſelues, but com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitte us wholli vnto the lorde, that we ſerue him altogether, and no other ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſter: that we halth not on both legges.
<pb facs="tcp:10446:19"/>
For the lorde is ſo gelous ouer oure ſoules, that he wil haue al that he hath redemed with his bloude, and can not ſuffre the fele ſhipe of the deuell, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ones ouercame by his deathe.
