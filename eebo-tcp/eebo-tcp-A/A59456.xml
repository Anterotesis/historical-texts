         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I have in this Play, as neer as I could, observed
the three Unities, of Time, Place, and Action; The
time of the Drama does not exceed six houres, the
place is in a very narrow Compass, and the Main-Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Play, upon which all the rest depend, is the
Sullen-Love betwixt <hi>Stanford</hi> and <hi>Emilia,</hi> which kind
of love is onely proper to their Characters: I have
here, as often as I could naturally, kept the Scenes
unbroken, which (though it be not so much practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
or so well understood, by the <hi>English</hi>) yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the French-Poets is accompted a great Beauty;
but after these frivolous excuses the want of design in
the Play has been objected against me; which fault
(though I may endeavour a little to extenuate) I
<pb facs="tcp:96641:6"/>
dare not absolutely deny: I conceive, with all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to better Judgments, that no man ought to
expect such Intrigues in the little actions of Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as are requir'd in Playes of a higher Nature: but
in Playes of Humour, where there are so many Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
as there are in this, there is yet less design to be
expected: for, if after I had form'd three or four forward
prating Fopps in the Play, I had made it full of Plott,
and Business; at the latter end, where the turnes
ought to be many, and suddenly following one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I must have let fall the humour, which I thought
wou'd be pleasanter then Intrigues could have been
without it; and it would have been easier to me
to have made a Plott then to hold up the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
            <p>Another Objection, that has been made by
some, is, that there is the same thing over and over:
which I do not apprehend, unless they blame the
unity of the action, yet <hi>Horace de Arte Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their lower Comoedies content themselves with one

perfect Characters as the admirable <hi>Iohnson</hi> alwayes
made, who never wrote Comedy without seven
or eight considerable Humours. I never saw one

I'le tell you, Madam, at one House there is a huge Two handed
Devil, and as brave a Fat Fryer as one wou'd wish to see in a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers-Day;
and a delicate Machin, as they call it, where one sits
and sings as fine a Song: And then at t'other house there's a
rare Play, with a Jigg in't, would do your heart good to see it;
but if there were nothing else in't, you might have your four
Shillings out in Thunder and Lightning; and let me tell you, 'tis
as well worth it as one Penny's worth another.</p>

Drammatick Poem there has been such breaks, such Characters,
such Figures, such Images, such Heroick Patterns, such Heights,

such Flights, such Intrigues, such Surprizes, such Fire, Salt, and

            <l>PHysitians tell us, that in every age</l>
            <l>Some one particular Disease does rage,</l>
            <l>The Scurvy once, and what you call the Gout,</l>
            <l>But Heaven be prais'd their Reign is almost out;</l>
            <l>Yet a worse malady then both is bred,</l>
            <l>For Poetry now reigneth in their stead:</l>
            <l>The Itch of writing Playes, the more's the pity,</l>
            <l>At once has seis'd the Town, the Court, and City.</l>
            <l>Amongst the rest the Poet of this day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </l>
            <l>By meer infection has produc'd a Play.</l>
            <l>Once his hot fit was strong when he was bold</l>
            <l>To write, but while you judge hee's in the Cold,</l>
            <l>Yet pray consider, few of you but may</l>
            <l>Be given up so farre to write a Play:</l>
            <l>If not for his, for your own sakes be kinde,</l>
            <l>And give that mercy which you hope to finde.</l>
