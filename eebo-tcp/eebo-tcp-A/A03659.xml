            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>To speake somewhat of the occasion of those warres, that the Historie may the better appeare. <hi>Alexander</hi> the third of that name, King of SCOT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND departed this life suddenlie without suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to the crowne, except <hi>Margaret</hi> his Neece, daughter to the King of <hi>Norway,</hi> who beeing left the vndoubted heire to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, King <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>England</hi> desired her in mariage to his sonne Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> whereunto our Scottish Nobilitie easilie condescended, but shee beeing dead, before the ambassadors arriued, they returned with sorrowfull hearts: wherevpon arose great t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But <hi>Bruce</hi> being a man of Heroik spirit, refused absolutely to subject a free Realme to the seruitude of any forraine Prince whomsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.

Shortly after, there fell out a slaughter of <hi>Makdulffe</hi> Erle of <hi>Fife,</hi> by the <hi>Abirnethies</hi> men at that time in great authoritie and wealth, and because <hi>Makdulffe</hi> his brother suspected the King to bee partiall in judging, summond him to bee judged before King <hi>Edward.</hi> The <hi>Ballioll</hi> being there present, and sitting beside King <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dward</hi> in the conuention of Estates, and being called, thoght to answere by a Procutour, was compelled to arise and defend his cause at the Barre, wherewith being sorely grieued, albeit hee durst not peepe for the time, yet returning home in a maruelous chaufe, reuoluing in his minde, how hee might cast off this yoke and bondage, whereunto foolishly hee had subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted himselfe, and as hee did meditate vpon this, a profitable dissention for his purpose, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terueened betweene <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> which immediatly brast foorth in warre: so that at a Conuention in <hi>Scotland</hi> both the Kings Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours were present. The French to renue their olde league with the new King, the English by the recent surrender of the Realme, desired assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in that warre. Both the Ambassadours
<pb facs="tcp:15266:4"/>
were referred to the Parliament, the Nobilitie prone to cast off the late yoke of <hi>England</hi> decer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the French petition just, and the English vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, for that league with <hi>France,</hi> was made fiue hundreth yeeres agoe, by the consent of the whole Realme, inviolably obserued to that day, but that surrender was but new throwen out of the King against his will, which albeit hee had beene willing to doe, yet neither was the King, nor the Realme bound to bide at it, seeing it was done without the consent of the Estates in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, without whose consent, the King could doe nothing. These Newes comming to King <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwards</hi> eares, hauing taken some Moneths truce with <hi>France,</hi> hee sent his Nauie that was bowne to <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> thinking to ouerthrowe the Scots, before they were prouided, and to keep <hi>Barwike</hi> vnvittalled. The Scots encountring this Nauie at the Riuer mouth of <hi>Tweed,</hi> wanne eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene shippes, and chased the rest. King <hi>Edwards</hi> wrath was by this losse more vehemently prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to reuenge, summond the <hi>Ballioll</hi> thrise to compeare before him at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and because he compeared not at all, hee sent for <hi>Bruce,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised him the Kingdome, if hee would write to his friendes, either to leaue their King, or to flee in battell.

common enemie, ran foorth for to receiue their King honourably: and so both horse and foote went out of the towne confusedlie. But <hi>Edward</hi> had appointed a number of horsemen to wait vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that turne, who cutted them off easilie from their companies, beeing vshed so confusedly, and out of order, and comming to the next Port, entred in the towne, the King with his foot-hoste fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, made miserable slaughter vpon all sorts of people, &amp; increasing in multitude, sent a part of his armie to besiege <hi>Dumbar,</hi> himselfe within few dayes receiued the Castell of <hi>Barwike,</hi> which the keepers randred, despairing of reliefe: then joyning all his forces together at <hi>Dumbar,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with the Scots hoste which came hither with a great battell to raise the siege: the victorie enclined to the English side. The chiefe men of the Nobilitie fledde to the Castell, but the Captaine not hauing Viuers sufficient to sustaine such a multitude randered, and all kinde of crueltie exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute vppon the captiues. But when the <hi>Bruce</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Kingdome in recompense of his trauell, and according to promise. <hi>Edward</hi> answered him in French, haue we nothing ado, but to purchase Kingdomes for you. <hi>Dumbar,</hi> and some other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles vppon the Border beeing randred, <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Striuiling</hi> were deliuered also: from <hi>Striuiling Edward</hi> passed <hi>Forth,</hi> and marched towards <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,</hi> where the <hi>Ballioll</hi> was, when without impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment hee came to <hi>Monrosse</hi>: The <hi>Ballioll</hi> by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of <hi>Iohn Cummine</hi> of <hi>Strabogie</hi> randred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, &amp; the Kingdome into King <hi>Edwards</hi> hands, whom he shipped, &amp; sent into <hi>England.

Hee tooke not this name of pride or of desire to Empire, but only (like another <hi>Sampson</hi>) vpon compassion, and loue of his Countrey-people. After this, he essayed with open force, tooke many Castells, (either not sufficiently furnished or not weill guarded, or negligently kept) and razed them. His Men of Warres minds were so confirmed, that vnder his conduct they feared no perrill, for that his hardiment lacked neuer wisdom, nor his wisdome the wished euent.

This Army without impediment wasted all to <hi>Rosling,</hi> a place in <hi>Louthian,</hi> foure miles distant from <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> &amp; to destroy farther within the Countrey diuided their Army in three, <hi>Iohn Cummine,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Fraser,</hi> the most wealthy men in <hi>Tweed-dale,</hi> gathering to the number of 8000 men, marched towards the enemy, of purpose either to keep in the enemy, that he should not run at randon to spoyl the Country, or if they found better occasion, to follow Fortun.

He left <hi>Odomare Valentine, Vice-Roy,</hi> to extinguish all innouations, if any begin to peepe. But now Wars arose, where he least meaned. Among the rest of <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation with <hi>Edward</hi> was <hi>Robert Bruces</hi> son, who conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with <hi>Ballioll</hi> for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and <hi>Iohn Cummine,</hi> cousen german to <hi>Iohn Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioll,</hi> late King of <hi>Scots.

They agreed betwixt themselues thus: <hi>That Bruce should bee King and</hi> Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine <hi>should resigne his Right in his fauours</hi>: &amp; Cummine <hi>should haue all Lands that</hi> Bruce <hi>possessed in</hi> Scotland (he

The cause why the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted time in this so manifest a turne, was, that his brethren might be apprehended before the brute of his execution should arise. <hi>Bruce</hi> in the meane time was informed of the sudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> danger, by his old freind the Earle of <hi>Gomera</hi>: vvho durst not counsell him by letter to flee, but warning by example, sent a pair of guilt spurs with som pieces of gold, as if he had bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed them the day preceeding. <hi>Robert,</hi> as men in danger are most tenty, not ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t what was meant by the propine called for a Smith in the night, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed shoo three Horses backward, lest the print of the Horse feet in the snow might bewray their flight, &amp; that same night might be espied: accompanied with other two, took journey vpon the 7 day thereafter: themselues and their horses weary, came to a Castle of his own standing beside <hi>Lochmabene</hi>: there finding his brother <hi>Dauid</hi> &amp; <hi>Robert Fleming</hi>: and taking them with him, scarcely opening vnto them the cause of his flight, chanced vpon a Messenger, carying letters from <hi>Cummine</hi> to <hi>Edward,</hi> bearing, <hi>That Robert should

obedience: but leauing the History of his further progresse, because it will appeare more particularly it selfe, I remit the Reader to the perusing thereof. This is he of whom it may be said, that was said of that <hi>Roman Scipio, unus homo nobis cunctando restituit rem.</hi> Into what bondage found he his Nation? To what liberty did he restore it? Since the times of the old <hi>Heroes</hi> none hath more excelled in all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. Who more couragious in warre? Who more temperate in peace? Who euer had a fortun more hard? Who euer did more hardly lead Fortun cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and lesse regarded her frownes? a constant course of victorie still enabling all his enterprises, whose mind would not bin broken, much more bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vnder such heaps of miseries? whose eonstancy would not be queld to haue his wife taken captiue, his foure brethren slaine, his friends with all mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes opprest: to haue himselfe not only barred of his patrimony and estat, but of a Kingdome? and all done against faith, by a Prince the mightiest of that age. Beside all these calamities, thralled, and brought to the extreamest of wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: he neither doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               </hi> recouery of his Crown, nor was at any tim sene, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit any thing vnworthy of a kingly mind. Let <hi>Rome</hi> boast of <hi>Camillus</hi> and <hi>Scipio, France</hi> of her <hi>Charles, Epirus</hi> of great <hi>Scandeberge, Scotland</hi> shall not forget this Prince, for she cannot. And if hee be not so renoumed as these, it is not for that he is not as worthy: but for that he hath not had so braue trumpeters of his fame, being born in so vnpolished an age: which time the destroyer and restorer of euery thing may perhaps hereafter in these more learned dayes amend. There be some who hold the opinion that the publishing of those books is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb facs="tcp:15266:12"/>
as embers of consumed discord, but it is not the publishing of the simplicity of our predecessours that can diuide vs, or cause any discord, but rather our owne too great subtilty, ambition and auarice, and the turning the pages of <hi>Tacitus</hi> and of Secretar <hi>Machiauell</hi> that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> breed an ague in our state. Can the reading of the warres betwixt <hi>Longcaster</hi> and <hi>Yorke</hi> separate the red and white Roses? I thinke no. But I am perswaded that al men of sound minds will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abhor discord in reading of these books, seeing what miseries and horrible calamities these warres, bring foorth and what great occasion we of both Nations haue to magnifie Gods goodnes, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               </hi> in our dayes since the Gospell hath bene in sincerity pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished amongst vs, hath turned all these bloody broyles into a peaceable Calme, especially now in the person of our dread Soueraigne: So that now, as the Prophet sayeth, <hi>Our swords are broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into mattocks, and our speares into siths.</hi> But if we would consider what meanes haue bene vsed, what paines taken, and plots laide by the wisest of both Nations, to knit vp this vnion, and yet could neuer effectate the same, vntill it pleased GOD to cut downe this partitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wall of long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, in the person of our most gracious SOVERAIGNE. GOD giue vs grace to bee thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for it. AMEN.</p>
