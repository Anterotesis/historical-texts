            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And I can truly ſay, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of this Treatiſe is for General
good; what ſucceſs it may find I
know not, or what Cenſures it
may paſs through in this Critical
Age through the weak manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it. But as to its Subject,
I cannot but promiſe my ſelf fair
<hi>Quarter</hi> from every Reader, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it treats of Principles that are
owned by the Light of Nature,
<pb facs="tcp:64312:3"/>
and ſuch as are approved of,
in the higher Light of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
            <p>My thoughts in the courſe of
my Studies have been exerciſed
upon various Subjects; and yet I
could never obtain of my ſelf to
expoſe any thing to publick View,
unleſs that which is not worth the
mentioning; And why I ſhould
make an Eſſay now, and why upon
this Subject rather then another,
I can give little Account, but only
that after my Conceptions about
it had been Communicated in the
hearing of ſome, it was ſuggeſted
to me, ſuch a Diſcourſe might be
uſeful in this preſent Age; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Atheiſme is ſecretly inſinuating
it ſelf into the Hearts of Men,
<pb facs="tcp:64312:4"/>
and getting ground Conſiderably
more then in former Ages.</p>
            <p>Not that we have many that
deny his Being, but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of it upon their Hearts
doth grow very weak and languid,
and the imbred Character of it in
Mens Conſciences are much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured
and ſullied through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements
of ſin. Now to brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
theſe Characters, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
Mens Reaſons, to awaken
their ſleepy Souls, to a Practical
acknowledgment of his Being, is
the chief deſign of this <hi>ſmall thing:</hi>
And the ſmaller, becauſe it is but
the leſſer half of what I intended,
and of what I have lying by me
in Papers upon this Subject: And
which doth better juſtifie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate
<pb facs="tcp:64312:4"/>
the Title, then what is
here preſented unto publick view.
But whether I may have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
and leiſure to Tranſcribe
them for others uſe, I yet know
not: I find Writing is tedious,
and takes up more time then I can
well ſpare from other imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that daily attend me.</p>
            <p>I have for ſome time, by the
help of a Friend, had ſome Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
upon another Subject tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
into a legible Hand, which
to ſatisfie the deſires of ſome, it
may be, may in time come abroad,
if they may be of any uſe; but my
thoughts having been more late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exerciſed upon this preſent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
I thought method required
they ſhould march in the Van, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:64312:5"/>
they proceed upon the moſt
Fundamental Principles in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>And being convinced by mine
Obſervation, as well as the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of others, that the preſent
Age is ſinking a pace into the
dreggs of Atheiſme, by debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Conſciences, and ſtifling
the very Light and Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that preach a Deity to all
Men; I thought no better way to
recover it, then to ſet God before
Men's view in the Works of his
Creation. And from thence to
demonſtrate the neceſſity of his
Being, and the ſeveral Attributes
of his being viſible therein: And
from thence to gather ſtrength to
the enforcing of that reſpect that
<pb facs="tcp:64312:5"/>
Men owe to the Great Creator
of the World, and the Author
of their Being: And not only in
thoſe Duties that are Cognoſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Light of Nature, but
even thoſe that are made known
by Supernatural Revelation in the
Word. Specially conſidering that
the Creation of the World is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to him that is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
of it; and who is that
<hi>Eternal Word</hi> whence the whole
Written Word derives its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
as well as this viſible World.</p>
            <p>So that I pitched upon this
Subject, not becauſe it is the moſt
Sublime, but becauſe it is the moſt
Radical and Fundamental to all
Religion, and moſt convincing to
the Reaſon of all Men. And
<pb facs="tcp:64312:6"/>
while I have ſought to improve
Natural Light to the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of it; I have alſo ſhewed the
Deficiency of it, that no Man
might reſt in it. And have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
the Creation, not only in its
firſt ſtate under the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> but
as elevated into an higher ſtate, and
higher improvement under the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Adam:</hi> Though conſidering
the ſmallneſs of this, I had almoſt
ſaid, Pamphlet; It cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
I ſhould be able to Enlarge
upon any particular herein: And I
was the willinger to Contract, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I find few Men can, or at leaſt
will find Time or Money for lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Volumes.</p>
            <p>Though I have always thought
that good Books are the beſt part
<pb facs="tcp:64312:6"/>
of a man's Furniture in his Houſe,
and the beſt Ornaments for Ladies
Cloſets. Certainly what doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
the mind is to be valued far
above thoſe things that only pleaſe
the Sence.</p>
            <p>And if Men object, what needs
any more Writing, the World is
full of Books; and what can be
more Printed then already is? Yes
verily, new Books in every Age
excite people to Read, when they
will not regard the very ſame things
in old Authors. And hereby old
Truths come to be newly minted
as it were in every Age, and ſo they
paſs off the more currently with
Men; beſides what further im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
are made of them in
every Age.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64312:7"/>
And ſometimes reſpect to the
Author makes people read Books,
which elſe they would not concern
themſelves about. And it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs
to pleaſe Men to their Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Aud if ſome Writings do
not match men of the higeſt Parts
and Learning, let them not deſpiſe
them, they may match men the
better that are a degree or two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them, who have alſo moſt
need of Inſtruction.</p>
            <p>And though high Speculations
may pleaſe beſt the Fancy, yet
Practical Writings do beſt tend to
make a better World. And I
would account it no burthen, but
rather an honour, and advantage
to the Age to be well furniſhed
with them; if they be not ſlight and
<pb facs="tcp:64312:7"/>
trivial. It is a mercy to this Nation
that the Preſs is ſo open for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating
of Knowledge; for it is
obſerved in thoſe Centuries where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Popery was in its higheſt Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and wideſt extent, there was
the leaſt written, and ſo there is the
leaſt account given of thoſe times,</p>
            <p>But to Conclude with reſpect to
this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> now preſented to this
<hi>preſent Age;</hi> If any ſay, <hi>Other
Pens have been Employed upon the
ſame Subject with it: I</hi> would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<hi>It is not eaſie to pitch upon any
Theme that hath never had an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
upon it,</hi> or, <hi>to walk in any path
wherein are not found the Traces of
any Man's foot.</hi> But this <hi>I</hi> can ſay,
<hi>I have not knowingly followed any
Man that went before me;</hi> And
<pb facs="tcp:64312:8"/>
though there are ſome Learned diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
in the World about Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme,
yet <hi>I</hi> find them too abſtruſe
for Common underſtanding; and
meddle little with the <hi>Practical
Improvements</hi> which are to be
made of that which is ſtyled <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Theology;</hi> which <hi>I</hi> chiefly
aimed at in this undertaking;
though <hi>I</hi> have performed it but in
part in what is now Publiſhed: <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in a Reſerve by me in my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
an account of thoſe ſeveral At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
of God that are Evidence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
from the Works of his Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with Practical Inferences upon
them for the advancement of true
Goſpel holineſs:</hi> But <hi>I</hi> cannot
reach ſo far at preſent. <hi>I</hi> have
taken ſome ſpare hours to Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
<pb facs="tcp:64312:8"/>
theſe few <hi>Meditations</hi> for
the Preſs; wherein <hi>I</hi> have Inſerted
a few <hi>Quotations</hi> as they did occur
to me; for my Reading hath been
but ſmall: Though it may be what
<hi>I</hi> have Inſerted may make what <hi>I</hi>
have written not more acceptable
to many <hi>Readers:</hi> How ever, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Books being expoſed to the
view of all, <hi>let every one take the
benefit as he can.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> have nothing farther to offer
here, <hi>but to begg of the Reader to
pardon the Errata's both of the
Author, and the Printer; and to
pray that God would both pardon
and amend the great Errata's of
the Age; That the Supreme Deity
of Heaven and Earth, and true
Religion, that is relative to him,
<pb facs="tcp:64312:9"/>
may find more Cordial and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
reſpect from this preſent Age;
wherein is wrapt up Mens Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Intereſs, and the preſent Intereſs
of our own Nation.</hi> And that any

this, that is ſincerely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <head type="sub">The Scope of the Text. How the Gentiles though
without the written Law yet are under Sin. What
the Law of Nature is. How Adam had the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his Creator. What meant by the Inviſible
Things of God. Though Inviſible, yet how ſeen.
What meant by the Creation of the World. What
difference betwixt the Creation of the World, and
things made. Why the Apoſtle only mentions God's
eternal Power and God-head. How the Gentiles
are without excuſe by the Light of Nature.</head>
               <p>THe Scope of the Apoſtle in the firſt part of
this Epiſtle, is to aſſert and prove the great
Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith, and not by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64312:10"/>
the Works of the Law. And to make his way
to it, He firſt proveth all men to be under ſin.
And all Man-kind being divided into Jew and
Gentile; he firſt proves the Gentile to be under
ſin, in this firſt Chapter; and the Jew in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.
And thoſe that are under Sin, cannot be
juſtified by the Works of the Law, and therefore
muſt of neceſſity have recourſe to the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Faith, being convicted of Sin by the
Law.</p>
               <p>Now leſt it might be argued, How could the
Gentile be under ſin, not having the Written
Law made known unto
them?<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand it of Gentiles without the Church.</note> for it was the Jew to
whom were committed the
Oracles of God; and <hi>where
there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
therefore in this Chapter tells us, they had
the Law of Nature, which was God's Law;
which though it is not written in Ink and Paper,
yet it is written in the Hearts of all Men, and in
the viſible Works of God's Creation: and the
Gentiles thereupon are convicted to be under
Sin, not following the Light and Conduct of that
Univerſal Law.</p>
               <p>For as a Law is Directive and Preceptive, it
miniſtreth Knowledge, and commandeth Practice:
So was the Law of Nature to the Gentiles; it
had a Light in it whereby they might attain ſome
knowledge of God; and it had a force in it to
urge them upon the performance of Duty and
Service to Him, anſwerable to that knowledg.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:64312:10"/>
But becauſe they darkned this Light in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as in <hi>verſ. 21. Their fooliſh heart was dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi>
and they did not follow the conduct of it,
but <hi>retained the Truth in unrighteouſneſs;</hi> hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they are convinced of Sin; for they did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
take up thoſe worthy Conceptions of God's
Being, which the Law of Nature might direct
them to; as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in <hi>verſ.</hi> 21, 22.
neither did they manage their converſation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
men, with that juſtice, ſobriety, equity,
and charity, as that Law did both direct and
urge them to; as the Apoſtle doth at large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
in the enumeration of thoſe ſeveral Vices,
which they lived in the practice of, in the laſt part
of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>Now this Law of Nature, as written in the
Hearts of Men, he ſpeaketh of in the Verſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Text; calling it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>That which may be known of God, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
in them.</hi> And as written in the Works of
Creation, he ſpeaks it of theſe words of the Text;
<hi>For the Inviſible Things of Him from the Creation
of the World are ſeen, being underſtood by the things
that are made, even his eternal Power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head:</hi>
And hence he infers they are <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,
<hi>without excuſe.</hi> And ſo I am come to the Text.</p>
               <p>I having already ſpoken from another Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
at large of the Glory of God, as manifeſted
in Chriſt; and of the Glory of Chriſt, as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
in the <hi>Goſpel-Miniſtration;</hi> my intention
from this Text is, to ſet forth the Glaſs of the
World's <hi>Creation;</hi> wherein we may behold, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64312:11"/>
from whence we may evince, both the <hi>Being</hi> of
God, or his <hi>Deity;</hi> and many Attributes and
Properties of his Being.</p>
               <p>And whereas all <hi>Theology</hi> conſiſteth of two
Parts; either that which is called <hi>Natural,</hi> or that
which conſiſteth of <hi>Supernatural</hi> Revelation; the
former I ſhall here ſpeak of.</p>
               <p>By Natural <hi>Theology,</hi> that all may underſtand,
I mean that knowledge of God, and our duty to
Him, which the Light of Nature may lead Man
up to, and which is <hi>concreat</hi> with his Soul. The
Image of God upon Man in his firſt Creation,
conſiſted in <hi>Knowledge</hi> as well as <hi>Holineſs;</hi> and
the knowledge <hi>Adam</hi> had of his Creator, was
partly by the <hi>Character</hi> of his Being engraven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Soul, which is by ſome ſtiled <hi>verbum</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an implanted Word; and partly by what
the large power of his <hi>intellectual Faculty</hi> might
gather from the Works of Creation; by both
which he was led to God as his ultimate end. Now
the Light of Nature, as it is now found in Man,
is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or the dark and weak remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of this Image ſtill; which the Apoſtle ſaith
the Heathens had, who had nothing of the
<hi>verbum</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or the external Word, either
by Writing, or any other way of Revelation.</p>
               <p>The Text may ſeem a Paradox; for it ſpeaks
of <hi>things Inviſible</hi> that are ſeen: If ſeen, how are
they <hi>Inviſible?</hi> And if <hi>Inviſible,</hi> how are they
ſeen? And therefore I muſt explain the Text.</p>
               <p>1. And firſt I ſhall ſhew what are the <hi>Inviſible
Things</hi> of God, ſpoken of in the Text.</p>

2. How theſe <hi>Inviſible Things</hi> are ſeen, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
from the Creation of the World; and
the things that are made.</p>
               <p>3. How upon the account thereof, the Gentiles
are ſaid to be without excuſe.</p>
               <p>1. For the Firſt:<note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> By the
Inviſible Things of God are
meant his Being, and the Properties and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes

called the Things of God;<note place="margin">Proprietates ejus quae non ſunt viſae. <hi>Arab.</hi>
                  </note>
not as if in God there was
Thing, and Thing, or any
multiplicity, diverſity, or variety in his Being, as
there is in the Beings of Men; where the Mind
is one Faculty, and the Will another: the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
is one thing, and the Act another; Wiſdom
is one thing, and Power another; Habit is one
thing, and Operation another; the Whole is one
thing, and Parts another: For the Nature of

where Mind is the
ſame with Will, Act with
Power, Wiſdom with Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> but God ſpeaking
to Men, ſpeaketh of himſelf,
as we are able to underſtand. And therefore we
read of Attributes and Properties in his Being, as
if theſe were diſtinct things; which yet are all
one in Him; and are his Eſſence and Being, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64312:12"/>
than the Attributes of it. Now theſe are the
Inviſibles of God.</p>
               <p>As God himſelf is ſaid to
be the <hi>King Eternal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 17. 1 Tim. 6. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,

                  <hi>whom no Eye hath ſeen, or can
ſee:</hi> So are all the Attributes
of his Being, in themſelves
inviſible. Though his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Power, and Wiſdom, are viſible in their
Effects; yet as they are in God they are inviſible.
For God being a Spirit, cannot be ſeen by a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Faculty; for all ſenſation is made by a
ſuitableneſs of the Object to the Senſe: Nay,
the Soul it ſelf, though it is a Spirit, while it
dwells and acts in the Body, cannot ſee God as
he is, becauſe it acteth here according to the Law
and capacity of its preſent ſtate: Which is to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
and ſee things by thoſe Species and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
which are preſented to it from the Phancy,
and conveyed to the Phancy from the Senſe.
But how it may ſee God, and underſtand in its
ſeparate ſtate, is not my preſent work to enquire;
for the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in the Text, of Man in
his preſent ſtate; and ſo theſe things of God are
inviſible to him, as to any immediate and intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
ſight of them. For they are not abſolutely
inviſible; for the Soul, when it is fortified and
fitted, may be capable of ſeeing them but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
in its preſent ſtate; <hi>Propter exceſſum intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibilis
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64312:12"/>
ſupra intellectum.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aquin.</note> For the exceſs
of the Object above the faculty, as the
light of the Sun is to the eyes of a Bat.</p>
               <p>2. How are theſe Inviſible Things of God ſaid
to be clearly ſeen from the Creation of the
World? The Greek word
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,<note place="margin">The Greek word may be beſt rendred, <hi>Deſpiciuntur;</hi> Are ſeen here below.</note> which we render,
<hi>clearly ſeen,</hi> will not well
bear that interpretation:
neither can I find it ſo in any
other Tranſlation. For the clear ſight of God,
and of his Attributes, is rather to be ſeen in
Chriſt, than in the Works of Creation; who is
called, <hi>the brightneſs of his Fathers Glory,</hi> Heb.
1. 3. Or, it is rather reſerved for the future,
than attained in this preſent ſtate. But yet theſe
Inviſible Things of God, though more darkly,
may be ſeen from the Creation of the World,
and the Things that are made; as the Apoſtle
here aſſerts.</p>
               <p>Now by the Creation of
the World,<note place="margin">

meant the beginning of its
Being, and ſo the beginning of Time; and then
the Apoſtle means, that thoſe Inviſible Things of
God have been diſcovered and ſeen, <hi>a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione

               <p>Therefore by the Creation of the World, I
conceive, is meant the Things created, eſpecially
the firſt Maſs and Chaos; which alone was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly

Power.<note place="margin">Creatio eſt emanatio univerſalis entis ex nihilo. <hi>Aquin.</hi>
                  </note> Now here is ſeen
God's Eternal Power, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He ſpeaketh of both, though chiefly
of the latter; For the Eye of the Body behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Viſible World, the Mind thence, by the
help of the Senſe, is enabled to infer and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that this muſt be the Effect of ſome Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Power; and ſo the Mind doth ſee this
Power: For when the Mind, by reaſoning, hath
found out Effects in their Cauſe, it hath an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
ſight of what it hath diſcovered. And
that [Seeing] is here to be chiefly taken for the
Sight of the Mind, the next words more clearly

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> implies the Acts of the
Mind, as it doth raiſe it ſelf up to the knowledg

which is Infinite; from Viſible, to that which is

               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But why doth the Apoſtle only mention
God's Eternal Power? Are not other Attributes of
his Being to be ſeen in the Works of Creation, as his
Wiſdom and Goodneſs, as well as his Eternity and
Power?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle mentioneth the Power of
God, becauſe of all God's Attributes, that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be moſt eminent and conſpicuous in the
Work of Creation. For it was properly an Act
of Power, to make all things out of Nothing;
though his Wiſdom was ſeen in the guiding of
his Power, and his Goodneſs in making all things
good. And the Apoſtle mentions God's Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the Text, which is another Attribute, when
he calls his Power Eternal: And by this he ſhews,
that as the World had its being in Time, ſo that
God who made it, was before it, or elſe he could
not have made it, as the Cauſe muſt needs be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Effect; And what is before the Creation
of the World, and every thing that is made, muſt
needs be before all Time, (which came in with
the Creature, as the meaſure of its duration) and
ſo be Eternal.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:64312:14"/>
But yet though only God's Power and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
be here mentioned; yet, as
a Learned Expoſitor Obſerves,<note place="margin">Eſtius in Loc.</note>
his other Attributes are includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Word <hi>God-head.</hi> As if the Apoſtle
ſhould have ſaid, In the Creation of the
World are ſeen God's Power, and God's Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
But what need I particularly mention any
more Attributes of his Being, when his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
it ſelf, which comprehends them all, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted

               <p>The laſt particular to be explained is, How
the Gentiles are hereupon ſaid to be without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe?</p>
               <p>A man may be ſaid to be without excuſe, when
he hath no Apology to make for himſelf, as the
word in the Text ſignifies; and that either with
reſpect to <hi>malum culpae,</hi> the fault committed by
him: Or, <hi>malum poenae,</hi> the puniſhment inflicted
upon him. In both, the Gentiles were without
excuſe.</p>
               <p>1. As to the <hi>malum culpae,</hi> or the evil of ſin
they were guilty of: For they had ſuch means of
knowledg miniſtred to them, by the Light and
Law of Nature, that might have led them to
more venerable thoughts of God, and a more
honourable worſhip of him, than was practiſed
by them: And alſo to a more righteous and

thereupon they were without excuſe.</p>
               <p>2. And then as to the evil of Puniſhment, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
for their ſin; God would be juſtified
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64312:15"/>
therein, and they left without excuſe, when he
ſhould proceed to Judgment.</p>
               <p>For God doth, and will manage his Judgments
in ſuch Righteouſneſs towards all men, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to their ſeveral capacities and conditions in
this World, that every man may be found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
excuſe that falls under them.</p>
               <p>How far the Light and Law of Nature may
lead a man towards his Salvation, I ſhall not here
diſpute: All that the Apoſtle aſſerteth here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Gentiles, is, That they were <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> deals with the Gentiles
thus particularly, becauſe the Miniſtry of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion
was more peculiarly committed to
him than the other Apoſtles. And he doth it
rather in this Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> than in any
other, becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> was the chief Seat of the
Gentiles Empire in the Apoſtles time; and where
Idolatry and moral Wickedneſs alſo did moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
as it uſually doth in ſuch great Cities;
and as their own Hiſtorians do abundantly declare
concerning it.</p>

Being of God three wayes made known. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Arguments to prove God's Being from
the Works of Creation.</head>
               <p>THus having explained the parts of the Text,
I ſhall raiſe out of them theſe two general
Doctrines.</p>
               <p>DOCT. I.
1. <hi>That the Being of God, and ſeveral Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of his Being, may be ſeen and underſtood from
the Creation of the World, and the things that are
made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>DOCT. II.
2. <hi>That to fall ſhort in knowledg or practice, of
what the Light and Law of Nature may lead men up
to, will render them inexcuſable, though they have
not the written Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall firſt ſpeak of the former; and firſt ſhew
how the Being of God, and then the Attributes
of his Being, may be demonſtrated therefrom.</p>
               <p>Now there are two ſorts of Demonſtrations,
one is,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> a <hi>Priori;</hi> when Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
are demonſtrated from
their Cauſe. Now the Being
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64312:16"/>
of God cannot be thus demonſtrated; no man
can demonſtrate the neceſſity of ſuch a Being from
any Antecedent Cauſe.</p>
               <p>And the other is <hi>a poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riori;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> where Cauſes are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
from their Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
And ſo the Works of Creation do demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
God's Being. When a Man ſhall ſeriouſly
conſider this great Fabrick of Heaven and Earth,
his mind may thence gather the Being of God.
There is enough written in the Book of God's
Creation, to declare his Being to us; though
there was nothing written of it in the Book of
the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>The Being of God is three wayes made known
to men.</p>
               <p>1. By the Light of Natural Conſcience. There
are ſome Characters and Impreſſions of his Being
within all men; for Man being made for God, he
hath put a peculiar impreſſion of his Being upon
his Soul, which the brute Beaſts have not. Though
they have ſome reſemblance of reaſon, yet they
have nothing of the impreſſion of a Deity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are not made to the immediate praiſe
and glory of their Creator, as Man is: Which is
the reaſon why all Nations have acknowledged,
and worſhipped a Deity. When the Apoſtle
went forth in the execution of his Commiſſion,
to preach the Goſpel in the Nations of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
World; where-ever he came, he found the
People performing Worſhip to ſome Deity or
other. When he came to <hi>Athens,</hi> he found there
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64312:16"/>
that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or ſuperſtitious fear, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of their Gods; which <hi>Luke</hi> mentions in
<hi>Acts</hi> 17. 22. Yea, not onely at <hi>Athens,</hi> which
was a place of Learning, but even amongſt the
barbarous people: Which we read of in <hi>Acts</hi> 14.
how they brought Garlands, and would have
offered Sacrifices to <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> which
ſhews they had upon their hearts the ſenſe of a
Deity; and ſome kind of religious Worſhip was
found amongſt them. And their Learned Men
have all along aſſerted, the worſhip of a Deity
to be the chief part of the Law of Nature, God
having a Witneſs for himſelf in every Man's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
But this I ſhall ſpeak more of after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>2. The Being of God is made known by the
Scriptures, which throughout declare to us that
God is: And this is the evidence of Faith, as in
Heb. 11. 3. <hi>Through Faith we underſtand that the
Worlds were framed by the Word of God; ſo that
the things which are ſeen, were not made of things
which do appear.</hi> A Text ſomewhat parallel to
that which I am now diſcourſing upon. For both
of them ſpeaks of the Viſible Things of Nature,
and the Inviſible Things of God. Both do
ſpeak of theſe Inviſible things of God, evidenced
to the mind of man. But with this difference,
the one doth ſpeak of the evidence that Reaſon
gathers from Nature, the other of the evidence
of Faith from the Word of God. So it follows
in the ſixth Verſe; <hi>He that cometh to God, muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that he is.</hi> Faith believes it from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64312:17"/>
which give witneſs of him, being the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Object of Faith. And God hath written his
Name in clearer Characters in theſe, than what is
found in the Book of Conſcience. Had Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Conſcience been ſufficient, there had been no
need of the Scriptures, which were written to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
rectifie, and guide Conſcience, wherein
it is defective or erroneous: So that, as it is ſaid,
<hi>Ideò ſcribuntur omnes Libri ut emendetur unus;</hi> All
Books are written to amend the Book of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
So eſpecially we may ſay it of the Book
of Scriptures. Conſcience hath thence a clearer
account, not only of the Will and Counſels of
God, but even of his very Nature and Being,
than by any Characters thereof it can diſcover
within it ſelf.</p>
               <p>3. The Being of God is alſo made known to
us from the Works of Creation. All theſe Works
of God do preach a Deity. <hi>As the Heavens are
ſaid to declare his Glory, and the Firmament to ſhew
his Handy-work,</hi> Pſal. 19. 1. ſo his <hi>Name is ſaid
to be excellent in all the Earth,</hi> Pſal. 8. 1. The
Beams of his Divinity ſhine through the Latitude
of all Created Beings. And if you lay your eye
in a Beam of the Sun, it leads it to the Body of
the Sun. As in every Creature there is <hi>aliquid
nihili,</hi> ſomething of nothing; ſo there is <hi>aliquid
Dei,</hi> ſomething of God.</p>
               <q>Praeſentemque refert quaelibet Herba Deum.</q>
               <p>The Herbs we ſee, ſhew God to Be.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:64312:17"/>
As the Philoſopher being asked, where his
Books were, anſwered, His Books were, <hi>Totius
Entis naturalis Univerſitas;</hi> The Univerſity of
all natural Being. And verily thoſe that have
no Books, and never were at any Univerſity of
Learning, may in the Book of Nature, and the
Univerſity of created beings, read and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the Being of God.</p>
               <p>Now this is the Evidence of his Being that my
<hi>Text</hi> ſpeaks of, and therefore is to be the ſubject
of my preſent Diſcourſe. Which I ſhall explain
by theſe following Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. It is impoſſible for this Creation to
give itſelf a Being. The Heavens could not
make themſelves, nor the Earth itſelf, for then
they ſhould be before themſelves. Their acting
before their exiſting, which is impoſſible to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
For it is a true ſaying in Philoſophy, <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rari
ſequitur eſſe;</hi> Operations do follow the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
Being, both as to time, and the manner of
working. As alſo, <hi>Nihil producitur in actum niſi
per ens in actu;</hi> Nothing is produced into actual
being but by ſome Being that doth actually exiſt.
And therefore this Creation muſt
be brought into being by ſome
actual Being that was before it:<note place="margin">Nil ſe gignit, nil provenit a ſe. <hi>Paling.</hi>
                  </note>
And what can that be but God
alone.</p>
               <p>Should we aſſert the World was made by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
as the <hi>Carpocratians</hi> ſaid of old; yet who
then made thoſe Angels. Much leſs could it be
made by Men, for they underſtand little of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64312:18"/>
works of it how it is made. And how came
Man himſelf firſt to be? Its true what we read
Act. 17. <hi>Of one Blood were made all Nations;</hi>
but not by Creation, but Generation. And what
gave being to that one Blood? There we muſt
have recourſe to a firſt Being; and who that is,
the Text tells us, <hi>God made of one Blood all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or, ſhould we ſay according to the antient <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,</hi>
now revived by ſome, That the <hi>Univerſe</hi>
was framed by the <hi>fortuitous</hi> concourſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
<hi>Atomes</hi> of ſeveral Forms, Figures, and
Qualities, that from Eternity danced up and
down in an <hi>infinite ſpace.</hi> And thoſe that were
heavieſt fell loweſt, and made the <hi>Earth;</hi> And
thoſe that were <hi>lighter</hi> took their place above
them. Thoſe that were moiſt did <hi>coaleſce</hi> into
Water, and thoſe that were <hi>thin and rare</hi> into
Air and the ſuperiour <hi>Elements.</hi> Which was the
fond and irrational Opinion of
certain Philoſophers of old,<note place="margin">The account of this Opinion we find at large in <hi>Gaſſendus.</hi>
                  </note> as
<hi>Leucippus, Lucretius,</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<hi>Epicurus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But of this Opinion we need no other confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
than the exact Order of all things in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
which could not be ſo by ſome chance or
accident. No more than an Houſe exactly built
could come into ſuch a frame by the <hi>Caſual
meeting</hi> together of Stones and Timber. And
why did thoſe <hi>Atomes</hi> fall together then, and
not ſooner? And whence is it that the courſe of
Nature is now ſo fixed and conſtant? if all things
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64312:18"/>
came together at firſt by <hi>chance,</hi> all things ſtill
ſhould fall out by <hi>chance.</hi> Or if we ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a poſſibility of ſuch an orderly concourſe of
theſe <hi>Atomes,</hi> yet how came theſe <hi>Atomes</hi> into
being? Did they make themſelves? That I
ſhewed was impoſſible. Were they Eternal?
How come they then to be changed from what
they were. For whatever is from Eternity m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt
needs be the ſame to Eternity. But he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
a further confutation of this fancy, may read
what is written againſt it by a
learned Knight in his Book
againſt <hi>Atheiſm.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sir</hi> Char. Wolſely.</note>
               </p>
               <p>There were ſome other <hi>Philoſophers</hi> that ſaid,
All things did ariſe out of Number; as the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoreans.</hi>
But it is ſuppoſed, they meant all
things did ariſe out of <hi>Unity;</hi> that is, from <hi>one</hi>
firſt Being; from that Unity which is, <hi>Unitatis
omnis effectrix,</hi> as one ſpeaks; that hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
all creatures, in the ſeveral <hi>Unities</hi> of their
<hi>individual</hi> Beings.</p>
               <p>Others of them thought that all things did at
firſt ſpring out of <hi>Contraries.</hi> It's true, All <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound</hi>
Bodies are made up of
<hi>contrary</hi> Elements.<note place="margin">Frigida pugnabant ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidis, humentia ſiccis. <hi>Ovid. Met. l. 1. p.</hi> 2.</note> And
the oppoſition of <hi>two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries</hi>
in Nature may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
ſome <hi>third</hi> thing different from them both.
But theſe <hi>Contraries</hi> muſt have an exiſtence in
their diſtinct natures before any <hi>compound</hi> can
reſult from them. And ſo though they be the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64312:19"/>
                  <hi>material</hi> or <hi>formal</hi> cauſe of any effects in Nature,
yet they themſelves could not have <hi>exiſtence</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome <hi>efficient</hi> cauſe; and this doth neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
lead us up to God, who is the <hi>firſt</hi> Cauſe.</p>
               <p>Or, could we conjecture with <hi>Pliny,</hi> (for it
was but his conjecture) that the World itſelf is
an <hi>Eternal Deity.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plin. <hi>Nat. Phil.</hi> Lib. 1. c. 7.</note> For ſo he ſpeaks;
<hi>God, whoſoever he be, if happily
there be any other but the very
world, he is all Sight, all Hearing, all
Life, all Soul, all of Himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But he ſpeaks more poſitively concerning the
Sun,</hi> Verily, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> it is the Life and Soul of the
World, the principal Governour of
Nature,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 6.</note> and no leſs than a God, or
Divine Power, conſidering his work
and operation.</p>
               <p>Or, can we ſay with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> That the World
is eternal; which Opinion he grounded upon
this Principle, <hi>Ex nihilo nil fit;</hi> Out of nothing
nothing is made. Which is true, if we ſpeak of
<hi>nothing</hi> as it imports matter out of which things
are made. But if we mean by <hi>nothing</hi> only the
<hi>term</hi> from whence Creation began, ſo it is not
true; For all things did ſo ariſe from nothing as
their <hi>term.</hi> It is alſo true in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> that <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
can bring forth <hi>nothing</hi> in a natural courſe;
but it is not ſo in <hi>Divinity,</hi> that treats of God and
his <hi>Infiniteneſs;</hi> For He can produce being out
of <hi>non</hi>-being, as He hath done in the Worlds
Creation. And as we read in <hi>Geneſis</hi> 1. 1.</p>
               <p>But it is as well againſt <hi>Reaſon</hi> as againſt <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:64312:19"/>
to aſſert the World to be <hi>Eternal.</hi> For as
there could be no Progreſs in <hi>Number,</hi> if there
was no <hi>unit</hi> out of which all Number ſprings:
For Number is greater or leſſer as it is nearer to,
or farther off from <hi>Unity:</hi> So there could be no
computation of time, if there was not ſome
firſt <hi>moment.</hi> For Time is nothing elſe but a
<hi>ſucceſſion</hi> or flux of <hi>moments;</hi> as one gives this
deſcription of it it is <hi>Nunc fluens.</hi> So that all time
muſt be computed according to its nearneſs to,
or remoteneſs from the <hi>beginning</hi> of time. If
there was no <hi>beginning</hi> of time, there could be no
<hi>Prius &amp; poſterius.</hi> We could not reckon <hi>Ancient</hi>
and <hi>Modern.</hi> And there could properly be no
ſuch thing as <hi>Antiquity.</hi> For this preſent <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
would be as antient, with reſpect to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
as a <hi>thouſand</hi> years ago. And therefore
ſeeing there is <hi>prius &amp; poſterius,</hi> ſooner and later
in time, there muſt of neceſſity be ſome beginning
of time.</p>
               <p>And if there be a beginning of Time, there
muſt be a <hi>beginning</hi> of the World. For Time and
the World were alwaies together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. We ſee in Nature every thing is ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a <hi>rational</hi> End. As the <hi>Sun</hi> enlightens the
World, which elſe would be but one great <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,</hi>
and unfit for habitation. The <hi>Clouds</hi> and
<hi>Rain</hi> ſerve an <hi>end,</hi> which is to cool and <hi>mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſten</hi>
the Earth, which elſe would be dry and barren.
The Winds do ſerve an <hi>end,</hi> which is to purge
and purifie the Air, that for want of <hi>motion</hi> it
might not corrupt and putrifie. And the Earth
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64312:20"/>
is endued with a <hi>Seminal</hi> vertue to bring forth
Herbs and Fruits of ſeveral kind for the uſe of
Man and Beaſt.</p>
               <p>And as all things in Nature ſerve an <hi>End,</hi> ſo
they are wonderfully fitted to their ſeveral <hi>Ends.</hi>
Now whence is this but from ſome wiſe <hi>Agent</hi> that
fitted things thus to their <hi>end.</hi> As Philoſophers
tell us of <hi>four</hi> ſorts of <hi>Cauſes</hi> in Nature, the <hi>Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
Formal, Material,</hi> and <hi>Final,</hi> and the one
hath dependance upon the other: If there was no
<hi>efficient</hi> there could be no <hi>matter,</hi> if no <hi>matter</hi>
no <hi>form,</hi> if no <hi>form</hi> no <hi>end;</hi> for the <hi>form</hi> is given
with reſpect to the <hi>end.</hi> But where we ſee <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and that <hi>matter</hi> inveſted with <hi>form,</hi> and that
<hi>form</hi> ſerving an <hi>end,</hi> we may then conclude this
could not be without an <hi>efficient.</hi> As when we
ſee a <hi>Clock</hi> or <hi>Watch,</hi> and ſee how every Wheel,
yea every Pin therein doth ſerve an end, and
theſe fitted to that end, we conclude this was not
by <hi>chance,</hi> but by the <hi>workmanſhip</hi> of ſome skilful
Artiſt. Or, had we ſeen <hi>Archimedes</hi> his <hi>Sphere,</hi>
artificially framed to repreſent the ſeveral Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Heavenly <hi>Orbes,</hi> we ſhould conclude,
this was not thus framed of it ſelf. So when we ſee
all things in Nature in <hi>motion,</hi> and every wheel
of Nature moving to a <hi>rational</hi> end, we may
conclude, this was done by ſome <hi>Infinite Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</hi>
Which the <hi>Heathen</hi> Philoſophers did
acknowledg, when they called God, or the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of all things, <gap reason="foreign">

               </lg>
               <p>By which we may perceive that they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended

of it. The Life of Man or Beaſt cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
without Food; Food they cannot have
unleſs the Earth bring it forth; bring it forth it
cannot unleſs it be watered with <hi>Showers</hi> from
Heaven; <hi>Showers</hi> there cannot be without
<hi>Clouds; Clouds</hi> cannot be without <hi>Vapours; Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours</hi>
there cannot be, unleſs they are <hi>exhaled</hi> by
the <hi>Sun</hi> from the <hi>Waters;</hi> and for this end the
Sun-beams do not only bring down Light and
Heat to the Earth, but <hi>attract</hi> Vapours from it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64312:21"/>
towards Heaven, and all for the ſervice of the
Earth. Wherein we ſee the Heavens hearing
the Earth, and the Earth hearing the Corn, Wine,
and Oyl, and other Fruits, and all hearing Man.
And as in this lower World one part of the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is ſupported by another, as the Earth by the
Waters and Air, ſo this whole <hi>lower</hi> World is
preſerved by the <hi>ſuperiour</hi> World, and under the
<hi>dominion</hi> of it, which ſhews the excellent Order
of things in Nature; each part tending to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the whole, which the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> call the
Harmony of the Univerſe. As one of them
ſpeaks, <hi>Natura eſt perfectiſſima Harmonia;</hi> There
is no Harmony better than the Order of Nature.
For as in <hi>Harmony,</hi> though there are ſeveral
Sounds, yet are they ſo tempered and <hi>modulated,</hi> as
to make pleaſant <hi>Muſick.</hi> So the ſeveral parts
of the <hi>Univerſe</hi> are ſo <hi>adapted</hi> and fitted to each
other, as that they all do <hi>conſtitute</hi> an <hi>harmonious</hi>
Order. And as <hi>Harmony</hi> ariſeth out of <hi>Diſcords,</hi>
ſo there is in the Univerſe, <hi>Concordia diſcors,</hi>
Creatures of contrary Natures and Qualities, yet
ſo mixed and proportioned, as that they ſweetly
agree together, and <hi>harmonize</hi> with each other,
and ſerve mutually to the preſervation of one
another.</p>
               <p>And if we conſider how the <hi>Creation</hi> is fitted
to the uſe of Man, and Man is fitted to it, who
was made the Lord of it, we may eaſily diſcern
this was done by ſome wiſe <hi>Agent.</hi> As there
are many pleaſant <hi>qualities</hi> in natural things, ſo
man hath ſeveral bod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly Senſes, whereby to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64312:21"/>
and enjoy the <hi>pleaſantneſs</hi> of them. To what
purpoſe was there <hi>ſweet Smells,</hi> beautiful Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
pleaſant Taſts in the Flowers and Fruits of
the Earth, if there were no ſuch <hi>Senſes,</hi> as
<hi>Seeing, Taſting,</hi> or <hi>Smelling.</hi> And ſo to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
would theſe <hi>Senſes</hi> be in the Bodies of Men,
if there were not ſuitable <hi>Objects</hi> provided in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for them. And ſo when we obſerve in theſe
fruits of the Earth ſuch vertues and qualities that
are both nouriſhing and <hi>medicinal</hi> to the Body of
Man, and ſome of them have <hi>Signatures</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters</hi>
upon them that declare their vertue, and
what part of Mans Body they are uſeful to, it
ſhewes they were created for the uſe of Man.
As we ſee a Man that builds an Houſe for his uſe,
he doth fit it with Rooms, Furniture, and Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils,
to make it a convenient Habitation. So hath
God fitted this World to be an habitation for Man,
who is made to be the Inhabitant of it, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 26.</p>
               <p>And as the Nature of Man doth affect <hi>variety,</hi> ſo
hath God furniſht the World with infinite variety
of Creatures, for the gratifying of his Senſe, and
for the delightful exerciſe of his Mind; and by all
ſetting forth His own manifold Wiſdom; and
commending Himſelf to Man by his great Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Bounty herein.</p>
               <p>And there is ſuch a ſuitableneſs betwixt the
World and Man, that Man is called <hi>a little World.</hi>
But the greater World doth ſerve the leſſer.
After God had made and finiſhed the reſt of his
works, He then made Man, and <hi>epitomized</hi> them
all in him; and gave him dominion over them:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64312:22"/>
And the exact fitneſs of the ſeveral parts of the
Creation to his uſe, doth ſhew that it is the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of ſome Infinite Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Whence is it that thoſe <hi>two</hi> Natural
Principles of <hi>Self-preſervation,</hi> and <hi>Self-propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
are ſo inviolably founded in the Nature of all
living Creatures; even thoſe that have no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
as well as thoſe that have: both which are
neceſſary to the preſervation of the Univerſe.
May not we hence eaſily argue, that ſurely this
was done <hi>intentionally</hi> for ſuch an <hi>end.</hi> And if <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally,</hi>
then it is done by <hi>Reaſon;</hi> and if by
<hi>Reaſon,</hi> it muſt be by His <hi>Reaſon</hi> that firſt made
this Univerſe. For is it not <hi>rational,</hi> that when
the Creatures were made they ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
both in the <hi>Individuals</hi> and the ſeveral
<hi>Species</hi> or kinds of their being; and what can
do this better in a natural courſe, than for them
to have theſe <hi>two</hi> Principles inherent in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Natures.</p>
               <p>And ſo we may obſerve in <hi>Vegetables,</hi> as Herbs,
Flowers, Trees; they all have a Seed in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
which Nature brings forth for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of their ſeveral Kinds in a continued
ſucceſſion of <hi>Individuals</hi> of the ſame kind. And
whence is this rational <hi>proviſion</hi> in Nature, but
by ſome <hi>rational Agent,</hi> and who can that be but
the God of Nature, that was before it, and
founded this <hi>rational</hi> Law in it, and is the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra
naturans,</hi> as Philoſophers ſpeak: That Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that is the Original and Law-giver of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:64312:22"/>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. We may obſerve in the Creation there
are <hi>degrees</hi> of being, and this ſhews there is ſome
<hi>chief Being.</hi> And there are <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Perfection,</hi>
which ſhews there is ſome <hi>chief Perfection.</hi> For
elſe we could not compute degrees, if there was
no <hi>firſt,</hi> with reſpect to which ſuch computation
is to be made.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>degrees</hi> in Nature are by learned Men
call'd the <hi>Scale</hi> of Nature; and we muſt come
to ſome top in the Scale or Ladder, and not
aſcend in <hi>Infinitum,</hi> though we muſt into <hi>Infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
which is the Infinite God. For, as I ſaid
before, where there is <hi>prius &amp; poſterius,</hi> there is
<hi>primum &amp; poſtremum;</hi> So where there is <hi>magis &amp;
minus,</hi> there is <hi>maximum &amp; minimum;</hi> where
there are <hi>degrees</hi> of Perfection, there muſt needs
be ſome <hi>greateſt</hi> Perfection, and what can that
be, but that God who is <hi>Optimus &amp; Maximus,</hi>
who is the moſt excellent Being, and the <hi>firſt</hi>
Perfection. For inſtance; we ſee ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
in <hi>Brutes,</hi> but more in <hi>Man,</hi> more in <hi>Angels,</hi>
but there is a Being then that is perfect in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.
And ſo I might ſpeak of all <hi>Perfections,</hi>
whether <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>moral;</hi> The <hi>degrees</hi> of them
ſhew there is <hi>One</hi> Firſt. Or, if you will look upon
theſe <hi>degrees</hi> of Being amongſt the Creatures as
ſeveral <hi>parts</hi> of being, we may again argue,
Where there are <hi>parts,</hi> there muſt be ſome <hi>whole;</hi>
and where there are <hi>particulars,</hi> there muſt be
ſome <hi>univerſal.</hi> Now we ſee the Creatures <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
is but a particular <hi>being,</hi> and in their ſeveral
<hi>kinds</hi> we ſee ſeveral parts of <hi>Being,</hi> none of them
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64312:23"/>
having all Being in themſelves, and therefore
there muſt be ſome <hi>totum</hi> of <hi>Being,</hi> or ſome <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
that is <hi>univerſal,</hi> that comprehends in it ſelf
all <hi>Being,</hi> and what can this be but God alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. We ſee in the Creation how Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that are without <hi>Reaſon,</hi> yet act according
to the exact Rules of <hi>Reaſon;</hi> which could not be,
were they not guided and acted by ſome other
<hi>principle</hi> than their own reſpective Natures.
For no Nature can act of it ſelf beyond its own
Principle: As we ſee how the <hi>Bee</hi> doth make its
<hi>Comb,</hi> and the <hi>Spider</hi> its <hi>Web,</hi> and the <hi>Birds</hi> their
<hi>Neſts,</hi> and <hi>Bevers</hi> their <hi>Houſes</hi> in the Waters,
conſiſting of ſeveral ſtories (as I have heard from
Eye-witneſſes) according to the exacteſt Rules
of Art and Reaſon. And if you ſay, that theſe
Creatures have Reaſon <hi>quoad hoc,</hi> as to thoſe
things that belong to the benefit of their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
though not to other things; Yet what
ſhall we ſay to thoſe Creatures that have not ſo
much as <hi>Senſe,</hi> or a <hi>Senſitive</hi> life; as Plants and
Trees in this lower World. Whence is it that the
<hi>Ivy,</hi> as if it did know it was a weak Plant, and
could not ſubſiſt of itſelf ſhould <hi>naturally</hi> bend to
the Wall or Tree that is near it, there to fix, and
as it were <hi>incorporate</hi> itſelf by a ſtrange and <hi>firm
in.heſion?</hi> Whence is it that a <hi>Tree</hi> doth fix its
<hi>Roots</hi> with that <hi>ſtrength</hi> and Art in the bowels of
the Earth, that no man can imagine how it could
be done better, as if it did know what <hi>blaſts</hi> of
wind it muſt encounter with, which threaten its
ſubverſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:64312:23"/>
And what Wiſdom is that which guides and
carries the <hi>Root</hi> downward, when the <hi>Boughs</hi> and
<hi>Branches</hi> aſcend upward; as if it underſtood the
need it ſtood in of the <hi>fatneſs</hi> and <hi>moiſture</hi> of the
Earth, and therefore doth ſend forth its <hi>roots</hi> up
and down through the Earth to <hi>forage,</hi> and fetch
it in.</p>
               <p>So alſo, If we conſider how curiouſly the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brio</hi>
or Infant is formed in the Womb of her that
is with Child; the <hi>formative vertue</hi> that doth this
is ignorant of what it doth, and yet every part is
formed to a <hi>rational</hi> End in Nature.</p>
               <p>And whence is it in the upper World that the
<hi>Sun</hi> is placed at ſuch a convenient diſtance from
the Earth, and ſteers its <hi>motion</hi> by ſuch a <hi>Line</hi> as
is moſt for the benefit of it. That when it is
gone to its <hi>Tropic</hi> in the <hi>South,</hi> it ſhould return
back again to the <hi>North,</hi> as if it did <hi>rationally</hi>
provide for the benefit of each part and <hi>region</hi> of
the lower World? In ſo much that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>
doth attribute Knowledg to it, Pſal. 104. 19. <hi>The
Sun knoweth its going down.</hi> And as <hi>Tully</hi> argues
concerning the Heavens, Their <hi>motion</hi> is either
by <hi>Nature, Chance,</hi> or <hi>Prudence.</hi> Not by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
for if they were light, they would move
<hi>upwards;</hi> if heavy, they would move <hi>down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;</hi>
if neither, they would ſtand ſtill: Nor
by <hi>chance,</hi> for they move in a conſtant and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<hi>Order,</hi> where there is nothing <hi>temerarium
nec fortuitum,</hi> nothing raſh nor <hi>accidental,</hi> as he
ſpeaks <hi>Lib. 2. De Nat. Deor.</hi> And therefore they
move by Prudence: And that not their own, as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64312:24"/>
they were Gods, as ſome <hi>imagined,</hi> but by his
Wiſdom that made them, by that <hi>Eternal</hi> Mind
that <hi>ſuperintends</hi> and guides their <hi>motions;</hi> which
he that denies, <hi>Ipſe mentis expers judicandus eſt,</hi>
as he there ſpeaks: that is, one void of Reaſon.
If we yield theſe things are done by <hi>Nature,</hi> and
<hi>natural Inſtincts;</hi> yet ſtill we muſt reply, Whence
had <hi>Nature</hi> theſe ſeveral <hi>inſtincts;</hi> and if it acts
and moves by a Law, who put this <hi>Law</hi> firſt into
it, but He that made all things in <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and
hath left the prints and <hi>footſteps</hi> of it in the ſeveral
works of his hand. If we ſee an <hi>Arrow</hi> for the
moſt part hit the <hi>mark,</hi> no man will ſay, This is
by <hi>chance;</hi> but it is guided by ſome skilful hand.
So <hi>Nature</hi> could never produce in ſo great a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy</hi>
ſuch admirable <hi>effects,</hi> if it was not guided
by ſome inviſible hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. We ſee this Order in Nature, that
all Creatures do ſerve ſome <hi>end</hi> above themſelves;
As <hi>Creatures</hi> without life do ſerve thoſe <hi>Creatures</hi>
that have life, and thoſe <hi>Creatures</hi> that have only a
<hi>vegetative</hi> life ſerve the <hi>Creatures</hi> that have a <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
Life,</hi> and thoſe that have a <hi>Senſitive</hi> Life do
ſerve Man that hath a ſuperiour <hi>Rational</hi> Life; and
therefore Man alſo was made to ſerve ſome <hi>end</hi>
above himſelf: and what can this be but to ſerve
his <hi>Creator.</hi> For there is no end that Man can
ſerve above himſelf, but ſerving God, which
may evidence to us that <hi>God</hi> is.</p>
               <p>And as there is ſome Equity and Reaſon that
thoſe things in Nature which are <hi>inferior</hi> ſhould
ſerve the <hi>ſuperior,</hi> ſo it is the higheſt Reaſon in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64312:24"/>
the world, that Man ſhould ſerve Him that is
infinitely <hi>ſuperiour</hi> to him, and <hi>ſupreme</hi> over all,
and which is that End above Man which he was
made to ſerve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum. 8. Laſtly,</hi> We ſee all things in Nature
under certain bounds and <hi>limits.</hi> As the Earth,
the Waters, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the
Heavens; So are all <hi>living creatures</hi> bounded and
<hi>limited</hi> in their ſeveral natures. And within theſe
bounds they ſtill abide. Now how came all
things to be thus <hi>circumſcribed</hi> and limited? Why
are their ſeveral natures extended thus far and no
farther, when it is <hi>natural</hi> to the Creatures to be
<hi>extenſive</hi> of themſelves towards ſome further per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in their Beings? Natural Bodies are under
<hi>Limits,</hi> and ſo are created Spirits, as <hi>Angels</hi> in
their ſeveral Orders or denominations, and the
Souls of Men. Now who hath ſet theſe <hi>limits,</hi> but
that <hi>firſt</hi> Being, who is <hi>unlimited,</hi> and hath made
all things in <hi>Number, Weight</hi> and <hi>Meaſure?</hi> It
is He that hath given the Earth its <hi>dimenſions,</hi> and
confined the Waters within their Banks, that
<hi>comprehendeth the duſt of the Earth in a Meaſure;
that weigheth the Hills in Scales, and the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
in a Balance.</hi> It is He that hath <hi>meted out
the Heavens with his Span,</hi> and appointed the
number of the Stars, <hi>and calleth them all by name.</hi>
Which the <hi>Grecians</hi> meant by calling their chief
God <hi>Jupiter,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or the <hi>Limiter;</hi> and the
<hi>Romans</hi> call'd him <hi>Jovem Terminalem.</hi> As God
hath given the Creatures their being, ſo He hath
ſet them the ſeveral <hi>Bounds</hi> of their Being. And
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64312:25"/>
to make this yet more plain in a few Inſtances.
Whence is it that a <hi>Stone</hi> hath not a <hi>vegetative</hi>
Life as well as a <hi>Tree;</hi> and a <hi>Tree</hi> a <hi>Senſitive</hi>
Life as well as a <hi>Beaſt;</hi> and a <hi>Beaſt</hi> Reaſon as well
as a Man; and why are not Men <hi>intellectual Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>
as well as Angels? All Creatures are <hi>bounded</hi>
in their ſeveral natures, and what, or who could
thus <hi>bound</hi> them, but the God and <hi>Author</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
So that upon the whole I may conclude,
That if the World was a <hi>living Animal,</hi> as <hi>Plato</hi>
fancied, and knew it ſelf, it would readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
its <hi>Beginning</hi> and Being from God
alone.</p>

And what a <hi>monſtrous</hi> thing then is it, that it
ſhould be found upon Earth! And eſpecially in
that part of the Earth, where Men have not only
the Book of Nature, but the written Word of
the God of Nature as a <hi>Comment</hi> upon the works
of it; for men to think it an height of Wit, to
be able to diſpute againſt a <hi>Deity,</hi> and a piece of
Gallantry to live above the fear of it!</p>
               <p>Men that are <hi>rational</hi> enough in other things,
yet in this their Reaſons are ſtrangely blinded;
which ſhews the ſtrange degeneracy of their Souls
in things that concern another World, while
they are ripe and <hi>pregnant</hi> enough in things that
concern this World. For did Men <hi>exert</hi> their
Reaſon in thoſe things, as they can and do in
theſe, it would <hi>conclude</hi> nothing more ſtrongly

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64312:26"/>
ſhould it not then argue, when it beholds the <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful</hi>
Works of this Creation, theſe muſt needs
proceed from ſome <hi>Infinite</hi> Cauſe, and thereby
be led up to the <hi>Being</hi> of God? As when a man

God hath ſufficiently by his Works of <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
evidenced to Mankind his Being, that they
might ſeek after him; And therefore there will be
no room left for any ſuch plea in the <hi>day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
for any people whatſoever in any part of
the world. <hi>If we had known there had been a God,
we would have ſought him, ſerved, and worſhipped
him.</hi> Doth Man plead, I never ſaw his Being;
Will we believe nothing but what our eyes ſee?
We never ſaw thoſe <hi>Souls</hi> that dwell within us,
ſhall we therefore not believe we have Souls?
do not their <hi>operations</hi> ſufficiently evidence their
Being in us? Nay, we do not ſee the <hi>Air</hi> in
which we breath, and yet no Man denies but
there is <hi>Air.</hi> And doth not the Text tell us
of the inviſible things of God, and therefore not
to be ſeen? Or, will Man <hi>plead</hi> he was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
when God made this World; how ſhall he

Artificer, though we did not ſtand by and ſee

               <p>But of theſe profeſt <hi>Atheiſts</hi> we have not many
inſtances; we read in Ancient Writers of ſuch
as <hi>Protagoras, Diagoras, Theodorus,</hi> &amp;c. who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed,
or diſputed all Deity; whom I find quoted
and confuted by learned <hi>Bradwardine,</hi> as they
were before condemned by the
<hi>Athenians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Brad. lib. 1. Coral. 1. pars ſecund.</note> and indeed ſuch
were exploded by the <hi>Heathen.</hi>
And thoſe that were ſo, yet were not conſtantly
ſo, as to maintain this Opinion to the end. In
mens <hi>ſerious</hi> and retired thoughts, eſpecially if
they be under ſome ſmart affliction, the Belief
and Sence of a Deity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
upon them.<note place="margin">Nullus eorum in hac Opinione quod Dii non ſunt, ab adoleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiâ ad ſenectutem perſeveravit. <hi>Plato. 1. 10. de legibus.</hi>

ſaid that no Man
perſevered in this <hi>Opinion</hi>
from Youth to Old Age. Nature cannot utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forget her firſt and fundamental Leſſon, that

As that <hi>Renowned</hi> Carver did
grave his own Image into the
Buckler of <hi>Pallas</hi> with ſuch
ſingular Art and Cunning,
that it could not be removed
without defacing the whole
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64312:27"/>
Work. For the Soul being from Divine Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
God hath put the <hi>Character</hi> of himſelf upon it
which cannot be utterly defaced, while its <hi>Being</hi>
continues. And therefore the Opinion that denies
a Deity, is rather a <hi>Frolick,</hi> a <hi>Fancy,</hi> a <hi>Dream,</hi> than a
grounded Opinion. And when the Soul of
Man is itſelf, and converſeth with it ſelf, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth
the <hi>Legible Characters</hi> of God's Being
written upon this whole Creation, ſuch Opinion
vaniſheth away.</p>
               <p>But yet we find many have this ſence of a <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
very weak, and the Notion of it very dark in
their Souls, and many ſtaggerings in their
minds about it. And not only amongſt <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>
but even amongſt themſelves, where the
<hi>Goſpel</hi> is profeſt and preached. Yea, we find in
many that live under the Goſpel leſs ſence of a
<hi>Deity</hi> upon their hearts, than amongſt the moſt
barbarous Nations of the World.</p>
               <p>But of all others theſe are the moſt <hi>monſtrous,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now the Cauſes that Men are led into <hi>Atheiſm</hi>
by, are ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p>1. Is, the Courſe and Efficacy of ſecond
Cauſes. They obſerve how all things come to
paſs by ſome viſible Cauſes, which are either <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi>
or <hi>Voluntary.</hi> In <hi>Natural</hi> Cauſes, if the
Cauſe be ſufficient the Effect follows, if not, the
Effect miſcarries. So that it is not a God, ſay
they, that governs the Events of Nature, but the
Natural <hi>Cauſe</hi> doth all. So, in <hi>Voluntary Cauſes</hi>
that depend upon the will of Man; If it be a good
thing that is deſigned and endeavoured, yet it
falls ſhort if the Cauſe be not <hi>ſufficient;</hi> if it be a bad
thing, it comes to paſs if there be <hi>ſufficient</hi> means
prepared for it. But let me anſwer as I go along.
1. Is it an Argument againſt the <hi>Being</hi> of God,
becauſe there are ſecond Cauſes? Becauſe inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<hi>Miniſters</hi> are made uſe of in the Affairs of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64312:29"/>
Government, doth this prove thar there is no
Supreme Governour? May there not be ſecond
Cauſes, and yet the concurrence of a firſt Cauſe
alſo, that doth ſteer and influence them in their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations?
2. And it is not alwayes that theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Cauſes how ſufficient ſoever they may ſeem,
that they produce their end. Sometimes Nature
miſcarries in her <hi>Productions,</hi> and none can give
a reaſon for it.</p>
               <p>And ſo in Voluntary Cauſes, <hi>The Race is not
always to the ſwift, nor the Battel to the ſtrong, nor
Riches to Men of underſtanding,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves.
Though for the moſt part, the ſecond
Cauſe doth accompliſh the Effect according to
to the Law and Ordinance God hath ſetled in the
World; yet ſometimes it miſcarries and fails, that
Men might not place their confidence there.
3. Where the Effect miſcarries through the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency</hi>
of ſecond Cauſes, thoſe <hi>Deficiences</hi> are
ordered and regulated by God, as well as the
<hi>Efficacy</hi> of Cauſes. When God intends an
Effect, he will <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Influence</hi> the ſecond
Cauſe, ſo as to produce it, where he intends o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
he will ſo ſuſpend or divert it, that the
Effect ſhall not ſucceed. And under this Head
I may take notice that the long ceſſation of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
may be ſome occaſion of <hi>Atheiſm.</hi> For Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
are wrought above or againſt the courſe of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Cauſes; and when Men ſee them, they are
then even forced to ſay as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Magicians, <hi>Hic
Digitus Dei,</hi> Here is the Finger of God. But when
men for a long time together have obſerved that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64312:29"/>
                  <hi>Nature</hi> keeps its courſe, and things come to paſs
by the uſe of means, they grow into an Opinion
that all things are by Nature, and that there is no
<hi>Providence,</hi> and ſo no God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But why doth not God then in every Age
work Miracles to convince the World of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe the <hi>ordinary courſe</hi> of Nature
is ſufficient to it, if men did not ſhut up their
eyes, and refuſe to ſee. And God thinks it not
meet to put Nature out of its <hi>ordinary courſe</hi> that
he ſetled at the beginning, unleſs on ſome <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi>
occaſions, and for ſome <hi>extraordinary</hi>
end. But is it not as wonderful in it ſelf to ſee
the Sun move in a conſtant Line, from one end
of the year to the other, as to ſee it ſtand ſtill?
And to ſee a watery Sap riſing out of the Earth to
be turned into Wine, as to ſee Water in a <hi>Veſſel</hi>
turn'd into Wine; as it was in the Miracle of Chriſt
wrought at <hi>Cana,</hi> John 2. 3. Or to ſee Bread
brought of the Earth, as to have it <hi>rained</hi> down
from Heaven, as it was upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs?</p>
               <p>2. Another cauſe is, Guilt in the Conſcience.
Though it is not an <hi>immediate,</hi> yet it is a <hi>remote</hi>
cauſe of <hi>Atheiſm.</hi> For Guilt working in the
<hi>Conſcience,</hi> is an immediate proof of a <hi>Deity</hi> and
<hi>Judgment</hi> to come; but it proves a remote cauſe
of <hi>Atheiſm.</hi> For it makes men wiſh there was
no God, and ſo are thereby the more diſpoſed
to believe there is none. For the old Proverb is,
<hi>Quod valdè volumus, facilè credimus.</hi> What a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64312:30"/>
Man earneſtly deſires might not be, he is inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to believe it not to be. And hereupon are
ready to <hi>extinguiſh</hi> thoſe innate <hi>Notions</hi> of a
<hi>Deity</hi> that are within themſelves, or ſuch as may
be gathered from <hi>without,</hi> and to comply with
any ſuggeſtions to that end, that may be <hi>admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred</hi>
either by <hi>Satan,</hi> their own corrupt Hearts,
or prophane Men. <hi>Guilt</hi> begets Fear, <hi>Fear</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
Torment; this Torment doth diſquiet Mens
Peace, and much allayes the pleaſure of Sin;
That they may therefore provide a <hi>Remedy</hi> for
themſelves, they are willing enough to believe
there is no God. As <hi>Moraliſts</hi> tells us of an Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
that is <hi>Ignorantia pravae Diſpoſitionis,</hi> of
a <hi>wicked Diſpoſition:</hi> Such is that, when men ſeek
to darken that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that which they
may be Nature know of God; that they may ſin
with the greater freedom and peace. But this is
juſt as if a Man, to prevent a Danger, ſhould
<hi>hood-wink</hi> himſelf that he might not ſee it. It's
true, if there was no <hi>Remedy</hi> provided Man of
God againſt this <hi>Guilt,</hi> and fear ariſing out of it,
this might ſeem to be a <hi>rational</hi> courſe; but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there is a <hi>Remedy</hi> provided, it is Man's Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to ſeek after it, whereby to have his <hi>fear</hi>
and his <hi>Danger</hi> alſo removed together.</p>
               <p>3. A third Cauſe is, The ſtrange <hi>adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of things in the World. Men cannot ſee <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
Goodneſs,</hi> or <hi>Wiſdom</hi> manifeſted therein.
But it <hi>often falls out to the Wicked, according to the
Work of the Righteous;</hi> and <hi>to the Righteous, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Work of the Wicked,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64312:30"/>
Hence Men conclude there is no <hi>Government</hi> of
the World; and if ſo, then no God.</p>

               <p>4. Again, <hi>Atheiſm</hi> ariſeth in the hearts of men
from the <hi>diverſity</hi> of <hi>Opinions</hi> that have been, and
ſtill are, in the World about Religion. As <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutheiſm</hi>
of old was an occaſion of <hi>Atheiſm;</hi> For
when men ſet up many ridiculous Godds to be
worſhipped, no wonder though they cauſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to deride them, and to caſt off all ſenſe of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
So many now obſerving <hi>diverſity</hi> of <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi>
about Religion, are hereby led to think
there is no <hi>Religion;</hi> and if no <hi>Religion,</hi> then there
is no God; at leaſt, there is little ſenſe of a <hi>Deity</hi>
upon his Heart that hath no Religion. As it fared
in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> the many differences of Opinions
therein, made ſome at laſt turn <hi>Scepticks,</hi> and
doubt of every thing. And ſo in <hi>Divinity,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

to that known and true <hi>Apothegm, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logia
Sceptica tandem exit in Atheiſmo;</hi> Sceptical
Divinity ends in Atheiſm. And men by ſeeing
the various <hi>Judgments</hi> that are about Religion,
begin to queſtion every thing, and fix in nothing,
till at laſt they ſettle in Atheiſm. But ought not
men rather argue, ſeeing that all do embrace
ſome Religion or other, therefore certainly there
is a true Religion, though many miſtake it? And
Religion is <hi>embraced</hi> by all with reſpect to a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Will men ſay there is no ſuch thing as <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi>
becauſe one Man affects one kind of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and another another kind; and there is no
ſuch thing as Government, becauſe ſome people
affect one kind, and others another kind; and no
ſuch Being as the Soul, becauſe Philoſophers dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
about its Definition? It rather proves the
contrary. The variety of <hi>Sentiments</hi> about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
ſhould make men to ſearch out the true, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to caſt off all; and when they have
<hi>found</hi> it, to hold it faſt, and obſerve it with all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
reſpect to that God that is the Object of
it, and ſay with the Church in <hi>Mich. 4. 5. All
Nations will walk in the Name of their God, and we
will walk in the Name of the Lord our God for ever,
and for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. <hi>It ariſeth in ſome from</hi> pride <hi>of heart, as
the</hi> Pſalmiſt <hi>ſpeaks,</hi> Pſal. 10. 4. The wicked through
the pride of his countenance will not ſeek after God,
God is not in all his thoughts; <hi>or, as the Margent
reads it,</hi> All his thoughts are, there is no God.</p>
               <p>A proud Man doth ſecretly affect a Deity,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64312:32"/>
would be a God to himſelf, and therefore deſires
not to own a Deity, becauſe he hath no heart to
ſtoop to him.</p>
               <p>It was <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Pride, as well as his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that made him to diſown the true God,
the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Who is the Lord, that
I ſhould obey his Voice?</hi> Exod. 5. 2. And that pride of
<hi>Senacherib,</hi> that made him think himſelf <hi>ſuperior</hi>
to all the Godds of the Nations that he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,
and to the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> alſo, would
eaſily lead him to caſt off the ſenſe and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of any Deity at all. As you read the
Story of him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 36. 19, 20. And thoſe that we
read of <hi>Pſal. 12. 3, 4. Whoſe tongue ſpeaketh
proud things, ſaying, with our tongue we will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail;
our lips are our own, who is Lord over us?</hi>
diſcovered herein the prevalency of Pride and
Atheiſm in their hearts.</p>
               <p>As Pride did firſt lead the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> to
affect a Being like God, ſo it is that alſo that leads
men to <hi>diſacknowledg</hi> him, and ſet up themſelves
in his room. It was this Pride in the Prince of
<hi>Tyrus,</hi> that made him ſay, <hi>I am a God, and do ſit
in the Seat of God,</hi> Ezek. 28. 2. It was Pride
in <hi>Herod</hi> that made him take Divine Honour to
himſelf upon the <hi>acclamations</hi> of the people to
his Oration; <hi>It is the Voice of a God, not of a
Man,</hi> Acts 12. 22. And what was it but Pride
in <hi>Alexander, Caligula, Claudius, Domitian,</hi> and
others, who would be accounted <hi>Godds,</hi> when
here upon Earth. And he that deifies himſelf,
will ſoon deny the true God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:64312:33"/>
6. Atheiſm ſprings from <hi>inconſideration.</hi> Mens
minds are ſo alienated from God, and <hi>Divine</hi>
Things, and ſo <hi>immerſt</hi> in the Affairs of the
World, that they can find no time to ſit down
and conſider, what even Reaſon it ſelf might
ſuggeſt to them concerning the neceſſary <hi>exiſtence</hi>
of a Deity. Though Reaſon cannot lead men to
the knowledg of Chriſt's Mediatorſhip, and the
<hi>Myſteries</hi> of the Goſpel, the notice whereof we
have from Divine Revelation; yet if ſtirred up,
and improved, it might lead men to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of a <hi>Creator,</hi> and a firſt <hi>Being.</hi> The Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World carries in it a <hi>rational</hi> evidence
of a Deity to the Reaſonable Creature. As God
calls upon <hi>Idolaters</hi> that worſhip the Work of
mens hands; <hi>An Image that they bore upon their
Shoulders, and ſet him in his place; to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
men,</hi> Iſa. 46. 6, 7, 8. Had they but conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and conſulted with their reaſon as men, they
would never have worſhipt a dumb Idol. And
ſo God tells them, <hi>Iſa. 44. 19. None conſidereth
in his Heart, neither is there knowledg and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
to ſay, I have burnt part of it in the fire;
yea, I have baked Bread upon the Coals thereof,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>and ſhall I make the reſidue thereof an abomination?
ſhall I fall down to the ſtock of a Tree?</hi> So it is
in the preſent caſe; Did men conſider the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World, and the Characters of a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that are written upon it; and did they uſe their
<hi>rational</hi> faculty, and argue as men, and as they
can do in other things, they would not run into
Atheiſm.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:64312:33"/>
7. It ariſeth alſo from that little regard that
men ſee is had to God in the World. When men
obſerve how little the generality of Man-kind
do take notice of him, ſo as to <hi>fear</hi> him, to <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
him, to <hi>ingage</hi> him with them in their Affairs,
they are tempted to think thereby there is no ſuch
Being. And though men with their tongues
ſay they believe his Being, yet mens actions ſpeak
otherwiſe; and actions carry more <hi>evidence</hi> to the
World than words, and ſo <hi>Atheiſm</hi> is propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Example. And the innate <hi>notions</hi> of a
Deity in the hearts of men are much corrupted
and ſtifled, by the general contempt of God in
the World. When Children obſerve that their
<hi>Parents</hi> take little notice of God, and Subjects
obſerve the ſame in their <hi>Prince,</hi> and Tenants in
their <hi>Landlords,</hi> and the Unlearned obſerve the
ſame in many that are <hi>Learned:</hi> Yea, when Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſhall obſerve their <hi>Miniſters</hi> debaucht, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs
of God, how ſtrangely is <hi>Atheiſm</hi> propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
hereby! But if men well conſidered how
all Man-kind fell from God in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi>
and how the minds of all men are now by Nature
darkned and alienated from him; and the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that ſin hath got in the hearts of men, they
need not hence haeſitate in their minds about the
<hi>Being</hi> of God, becauſe the <hi>generality</hi> of men
have ſo little reſpect unto him. For till the
Grace of God renews Man's Nature, he will, by
a courſe of ſin, grow up into that hardneſs and
ſecurity, as to live, as it were, without God in the
World, eſpecially if men live at eaſe, and enjoy
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64312:34"/>
outward proſperity. For the Senſe of a <hi>Deity</hi> is
much excited in men by trouble and affliction:
As in <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Ship, when the
Mariners were in a Storm,<note place="margin">Jonah 2. 14, 16.</note>
every one then was calling
upon his God, <hi>offered Sacrifice, and made Vows.</hi>
And the like account we have in the <hi>Pſalmiſt,
Pſal.</hi> 107. where men are in a ſtormy Sea, <hi>reel to
and fro like a drunken Man, and are at their wits
end, then they cry to the Lord in their diſtreſſes.</hi> But
in proſperity men think they have no need of
God, and ſo caſt off all reſpect to him. And
<hi>David</hi> himſelf, who in his proſperity ſaid, <hi>My
Mountain ſtandeth ſtrong, I ſhall never he moved;</hi>
when God hid his Face, and he troubled, then
ſaith he, <hi>I cryed unto the Lord, and to the Lord I
made ſupplication,</hi> Pſal. 30. 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>8. Again, it ariſes from the Hypocriſy and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy
of ſome that have made high pretenſions to
the wayes of God, and Communion with him.
When it ſhall appear to the World that theſe have
made uſe of the <hi>Name</hi> of God only to ſerve a
Carnal Deſign, and their Profeſſion hath been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but <hi>Policy</hi> to advance ſome ſelfiſh <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</hi>
Many are ready hence to conclude, that
all that is talked about a Deity and Religion in
the World, is but Pretene or Fancy, and that
Grace it ſelf is but <hi>Nomen inane,</hi> as one ſaid of
Vertue, a vain Name. For it is preſumed, if any
have found out God, and the good of Religion,
it is ſuch as theſe; and if they had found them,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64312:34"/>
and enjoyed them, they would never have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
them.</p>
               <p>Now this Apoſtacy is either General, from all
Religion; when Men run into down-right Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs
and Debauchery: Or particular, when
men forſake their particular <hi>Profeſſions</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
that they have ſhewed Zeal in, and do it
for <hi>Carnal</hi> Ends; many are apt to be ſhaken here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
not only with reſpect to the Truth of the
particular <hi>perſwaſions</hi> of ſuch Men, but as to the
Truth of all Religion, and all Deity. For what
ſenſe any Man hath of a <hi>Deity,</hi> will be manifeſted
in that particular Way of <hi>Religion</hi> that he is inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in. And he that forſakes that particular
Way, whether in it ſelf it be true or falſe, for
ſome corrupt end, as he will himſelf be in
danger of running into <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> ſo it will have
a bad influence to draw others to it alſo.</p>
               <p>Again, this <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> is either through a Man's
own Corrupt <hi>Inclinations,</hi> or elſe occaſioned by
ſome External <hi>Coaction.</hi> As when a Man, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
<hi>Fines, Penalties,</hi> or other Perſecutions ſhall
practiſe contrary to the <hi>Dictates</hi> of his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
And a Three fold evil ariſeth hence; one
is, To them that thus <hi>practiſe</hi> againſt Conſcience.
Another to them that <hi>urge</hi> them to it. And a
third to them that ſhall be <hi>ſcandalized;</hi> and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
prejudiced againſt Religion it ſelf, and ſo
are upon the very Threſhold of <hi>Atheiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But may it not be replyed, Shall all be judged
by ſome? If ſome have been falſe in their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi>
have not others been faithful? Are there
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64312:35"/>
not Inſtances of <hi>thouſands</hi> that have forſaken all,
and laid down their Lives upon the Cauſe and
Conſcience of their Religion, and confidence of
this Principle, that <hi>God</hi> is? Which ſhould more
confirm our belief thereof, than the <hi>Hypocriſie</hi>
or <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> of others ſhake it and weaken it. I
know this Apoſtaſie is a great ſcandal to the
World, and in all Ages it hath been a Stumbling-Block,
and never greater than at this day. And
wo to the World becauſe of ſuch Offences. And
they muſt needs come, as Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 7.
And as <hi>Hereſies</hi> muſt come to make manifeſt mens
Integrity and Soundneſs in the Faith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 19.
ſo theſe Apoſtaſies come to try mens <hi>ſtability</hi> in
the grand Foundations of Religion.</p>
               <p>9. Many are ſo drown'd in the Life of Senſe,
that they cannot believe the Exiſtence of Inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Things. They can believe the Exiſtence of
the Works of Nature, becauſe they are viſible to
Senſe; but the Inviſible Things of God, out of
which theſe Works ſpring, they cannot believe.
A Senſualiſt, his Language is, <hi>Tell not me of a
God whom I never ſaw, of Heaven, and Inviſible
Powers, and the Pleaſures I never felt; give me
Houſes and Lands, Corn and Wine, and theſe good
Things that mine Eye can ſee, my Mouth can taſte,
and my Hands can feel.</hi> Theſe Inviſible Things
the Syriack Verſion renders <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>Recondita Dei,</hi> The Hidden Things of God; and
being hidden out of mens ſight, they regard them
not, they believe them not. But what, O Man, wilt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64312:35"/>
thou believe nothing but what thine Eyes can ſee?
Are there not Spiritual Beings in the Creation, as
wel as Corporeal? Shal we with the <hi>Sadduces</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Angels and Spirits? And are not Spiritual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
out of the reach of <hi>corporeal</hi> Sight or Senſe.
And are not theſe Spiritual Beings the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and excellent; and therefore God being the
moſt excellent Being, he muſt needs be the <hi>pureſt</hi>
Spirit, and ſo muſt be thereby inviſible to Senſe:
Do we not read of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Heb. 11. <hi>He endured,
as ſeeing him that is inviſible:</hi> And of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor.
4. <hi>Whilſt we look not at things that are ſeen, but at
things that are not ſeen.</hi> And of thoſe Believers,
1 <hi>Pet. 1. Whom having not ſeen, you love.</hi> And had
men Faith, it would be to them an evidence of
Things not ſeen, it would lead them up to that
which is Inviſible; but being <hi>immerſt</hi> in the Life
of Senſe, they cannot reach ſo high, and ſo God is
to them as if he was not.</p>
               <p>10. Philoſophy and State-Policy have been
great Cauſes of <hi>Atheiſm.</hi> I put them together,
that I might not multiply Particulars.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> Though in it ſelf it is a good
Hand-maid to <hi>Divinity;</hi> yet the <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> hath
been wronged by her <hi>Maid.</hi> The courting of
Nature hath kept many from eſpouſing true <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</hi>
So long as they can find a natural cauſe
of things, they will not, at leaſt heartily, own a
<hi>Deity.</hi> And therefore it is obſerved, that <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm</hi>
firſt began where <hi>Philoſophy</hi> was in its higheſt
improvement, namely, among the <hi>Grecians.</hi> But
I touched upon this before. As it is ſaid of <hi>Pliny,</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:64312:36"/>
he being inquiſitive to find out the Reaſon of the
Smoaking of Mount <hi>Veſuvius,</hi> went ſo near to it,
that he was choaked in the Smoak. So many by
their curious enquiries into Natural Cauſes, have
choaked the Innate Notices of a Deity within
their Hearts. He that wrote a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
called <hi>Philoſophia Theologiae An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Baron.</note>
Philoſophy miniſtring to Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ſet Philoſophy in its right place; and to make
the Encreaſe of the one, the Decreaſe of the other,
is the higheſt abuſe of it.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>State Policy.</hi> The <hi>Politician</hi> ſeeth he ſhall
never accompliſh his Deſigns, if he be over-awed
by <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and Senſe of a Deity. He muſt
not be a ſlave to his Promiſes, or ſtand in fear
either of making or breaking an Oath. He muſt
not be confined within the narrow Rules of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
or <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> He may ſee it his <hi>intereſt</hi>
ſometimes to ſeem Religious; but to be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
is not for his turn; which is according to
the advice of <hi>Machiavel</hi> to the young Prince.
And hence ariſeth <hi>Atheiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. It ariſeth from a forgetfulneſs of God. As
the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks of ſuch, <hi>Pſal. 51. 22. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this ye that forget God.</hi> Men do not exerciſe
their Minds in thoughts of God, and ſo forget
him. And a Perſon, or Thing that are not in
our Thoughts, are forgotten; and being forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
are as if they were not. Though men have
additional knowledge to the Natural Notions of
a Deity; yet if this Knowledge be not ſtirred up
and exerciſed, it will not prevent the growth of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64312:36"/>
Atheiſm in ther Hearts. When men ſet not
God in the <hi>view</hi> of their Minds, look not on
him either in Mercies or Afflictions, and carry on
their Affairs from day to day, without reſpect to
him, this is forgetting him, whereby they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, without God in the World. As we
know <hi>Fire,</hi> if it be not ſtirred or blown up, will
be ready to go out. So will the <hi>Notices</hi> of the
Being of God in the Soul, if they be not daily
excited in us; and there is nothing Man is more
apt to forget than God. Whiles he remembers
every thing elſe that concerns him, he is moſt
prone to a <hi>forgetfulneſs</hi> of him whom he ſhould
moſt of all remember. Let Man but follow the
natural bent of his own Heart, and he will ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
have <hi>God</hi> in his Thoughts, and have little or
no reſpect to him in the Actions of his Life.
And ſo God is forgotten, and is as if he was
not. And the great Adverſary of God in the
World, the <hi>Devil,</hi> will be ſure to aſſiſt with his
Temptations, that mens thoughts may be diverted
and alienated from the true God, that he himſelf
might reign as <hi>God</hi> in the World. He is ſaid to
be the <hi>Ruler of the darkneſs of this World;</hi> and
therefore ſeeks to propagate darkneſs, not only
by hindring the Light of the Goſpel from ſhining
into mens hearts, but by extinguiſhing the very
Light of Natural Conſcience, and ſo to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
his own Rule and Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly;</hi> Atheiſm ariſeth from <hi>detaining the Truth
of God in Unrighteouſneſs,</hi> the ſin that is charged
upon the Heathen. Men ſin againſt the Innate
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64312:37"/>
Notion of a <hi>Deity</hi> in their Hearts, till at laſt the
force of it is quite loſt; by giving way to fleſhly
Luſts, againſt the <hi>Dictates</hi> of their Natural Light
they ſmother it. And it is at beſt but as a Spark
covered in an heap of Aſhes, that doth neither
give Light or Heat. When men to gratifie their
Luſts will debauch their Conſcience, they will
hereby by degrees ſear it. For, <hi>Nemo repentè
fit Turpiſſimus.</hi> And men grow up to a profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy
in ſin, as they by ſinning againſt their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
do by degrees benum and ſtupifie it. As
it is ſaid of the <hi>Gentiles, Rom.</hi> 1. 18. they firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Truth that was naturally in their
Hearts, and then God <hi>gave them up to vile affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. And not following the Light
of Nature, were given up to ſins againſt Nature,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 27. And <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 18. the Apoſtle ſpeaks
of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they walked firſt in vanity of
Mind, and then came to be paſt feeling; there
the Senſe of a Deity is gone, and then they gave
up themſelves <hi>to all uncleanneſs with greedineſs,</hi>
verſ. 19.</p>
               <p>Thus I have ſhewn ſome of thoſe Cauſes out
of which Atheiſm grows, and is <hi>cheriſht</hi> in the
hearts of men.</p>
               <p>And was it only found in the dark parts of the
World, where the Goſpel ſhines not, it was the
leſs to be wondred at, but it is found even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
our ſelves, and is become a ſpreading <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie</hi>
in the Heads, but eſpecially the Hearts of
multitudes at this day. And I verily believe
there is to be found leſs ſence of a <hi>Deity</hi> upon
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64312:37"/>
many Chriſtians ſo call'd, that live in the mid'ſt
of Goſpel-Light, than in any part of the World.
For if we look to the Heathens, they all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
ſome Deity or other, ſo they have a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
reſpect to it, and have ſome awful impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
upon their Hearts towards it, <hi>will laviſh
Gold out of the Bag,</hi> and be at coſt for Oblations,
Temples, and Sacrifices; and have <hi>Indignation</hi>
againſt any that caſt contempt upon it. As you
know the cry that was made at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> when they
thought <hi>Paul</hi> did derogate from the Honour of
their Goddeſs, Great is <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi>
Act. 19. 28. And were fearful of having their
Godds charmed from them, and would put Chains
upon them to hold them faſt; But alas, how
many amongſt us have not ſo much reſpect as
this to the true God; but in ſtead of <hi>vindicating</hi>
his Honour, do <hi>blaſpheme</hi> his Name; find no
awe upon their hearts towards him, can part
with nothing of their Eſtates to ſerve his Name,
Worſhip, and People; are under no Conſcience
of praying to him, praiſing of him, or depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon him, are careleſs about keeping his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
or preſence with them. As God complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of old that <hi>Iſrael</hi> dealt more injuriouſly with
him, than any <hi>Nations</hi> had dealt with their Godds,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>I have ſometimes conſidered with my ſelf
whence this ſhould be; and have thought of theſe
things about it.</p>
               <p>1. It may proceed from the juſt <hi>Judgment</hi> of
God. When Men have the higher Light of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64312:38"/>
Goſpel, and refuſe to walk in it; God doth juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
leave them to fall below the Light of <hi>Nature.</hi>
According to that ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>To him
that hath not, ſhall be taken away even that he
hath.</hi> Where Goſpel-Light doth not <hi>enlighten</hi>
Men, it blinds them; and where it doth not melt
and ſoften, it <hi>hardens</hi> Men: and where it brings
not Men nearer to God, it ſets them farther off
from him.</p>
               <p>2. I have thought again, where the Goſpel
comes, Men take greater <hi>offence</hi> at Religion; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at the ſtrict Precepts of it, which croſs the
Carnal bent of Mens Hearts; or the <hi>Diſtinction</hi>
it neceſſarily makes amongſt Men, taking ſome
out of others, and ſeparating them both in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Practice, which makes Men take great
offence, and think diſdainfully of Religion that
hath ſuch Effects attending it; and thereupon
to caſt it off, to turn Scoffers, and then Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts.</p>
               <p>3. When the Goſpel comes, it doth detect and
condemn <hi>Superſtition,</hi> which in many is the whole
of their Religion. And when that is taken away,
their Religion, and reſpect to a <hi>Deity</hi> doth fall
with it. Superſtition is <hi>Religion</hi> corrupted, blind
Zeal, fleſhly Wiſdom, and the Arrogance of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
and the evil of it lies rather in the <hi>Exceſs</hi>
than in the <hi>Defect;</hi> and though it be a corrupt
Branch, yet it radically Springs from the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sence of a <hi>Deity</hi> in the Conſcience. As when
<hi>Paul</hi> came to <hi>Athens,</hi> and obſerved the many gods
they worſhipt, and the many <hi>Rites</hi> attending that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64312:38"/>
Worſhip, tells them, <hi>Acts 17. 22. Ye men of Athens
I perceive you are in all things too Superſtitious.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. I ſee you too great
fearers of <hi>Daemons,</hi> which they looked upon
as inferiour Deities; Now when ſuch Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
fear is removed by the knowledge of the
Goſpel, and no other true fear of God planted
in the room of it, the Senſe of a <hi>Deity</hi> will decay
and decline in ſuch a Soul. As <hi>Micah</hi> ſaid to
the <hi>Danites,</hi> Judg. 18. 24. <hi>Ye have taken away my
Godds which I made, and the Prieſt, &amp;c. and what
have I more?</hi> Some put all their Religion in a
Form, or a <hi>Ceremony,</hi> and when that is taken
away, what have they more? where falſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
is removed from a People, and they do not
embrace the true <hi>Worſhip</hi> in its room, they will
come to no <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and ſo to no God.</p>
               <p>Superſtitious <hi>Worſhip</hi> preſents Objects to the
Eye of Man's deviſing to affect the Heart; as it
was in the Worſhip of the <hi>Heathens</hi> of Old; and
ſo is now ſeen in the <hi>Pictures</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> of
the Romiſh Church; whereby ſome kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
and Adoration is maintained in the
Hearts of the People, that are yet meer ſtrangers
to the Worſhip of God in Spirit. And let theſe
be removed which upheld their Worſhip and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
and they will run apace into <hi>Atheiſm,</hi>
when all a Man's Religion is upheld by theſe
Crutches, if you remove them, it falls to the
ground.</p>
               <p>4. The great Truths of the Goſpel, and the
Principles of Chriſtianity lie ſo high above Man's
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64312:39"/>
Reaſon that they are fooliſhneſs to him; as the
Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 Cor. 2. 14. <hi>But the Natural man
receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they
are fooliſhneſs to him.</hi> Now theſe things of the
Spirit are the great Truths and Doctrines of the
Goſpel. As that God and Man ſhould be but
one Perſon; that Life ſhould come into the
World by Death, and Redemption by the Croſs.
That we ſhould be juſtified in anothers Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
by Faith, and not by our own good
Works. That a Man muſt be born again: That
the Body ſown in the Duſt, ſhall be raiſed again;
and many ſuch. Now when Men hear that theſe
are the Principles of that Religion that is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(as indeed it is) the only true Religion
in the World, becauſe they ſeem ſo incredible to
their Reaſon, therefore they do at leaſt inwardly
in their Hearts reject them, and account them
fooliſhneſs. And when Religion is rejected, men
will eaſily run into Atheiſm. And hence it is,
that ſometimes Men of the ſtrongeſt Reaſon are
the greateſt Oppoſites to Religion; where the
Heart is Carnal, it will influence Reaſon, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
it againſt it, both in the Practice, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of it: And the ſtronger Reaſon is, in this
Caſe, the ſtronger will the Oppoſition be. And
the Apoſtle therefore tells us, <hi>Not many wiſe men
after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are
called,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 26. Their fleſhly Wiſdom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
the Principles of the Goſpel as ridiculous to
their Reaſon, and their Might and Nobility the
wayes of it, becauſe of their ſeeming meanneſs.</p>

               <p>I Shall proceed next to Exhort you to Improve
the Works of Creation to the ſtrengthening this

higher Improvement of them, than what is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

Chriſt which wrought the Miracles in the <hi>Loaves.</hi>
So <hi>Senſual</hi> Men are pleaſed with that good they
find in the Creatures to ſatisfie their Appetite,
and gratifie their Senſe, but look not to that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

               <p>The Heathens beholding the Sun, Moon, and

And ſo theſe viſible things of

The acknowledgment of God to be the Creatour

what was their <hi>Apollo,</hi> but the Sun? their <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>

It's true, there are ſome <hi>Footſteps</hi> of a Deity in all

theſe Footſteps, as by a <hi>Footſtool</hi> to the God of
the World, as <hi>Solomon</hi> by ſeveral ſteps aſcended
to his Throne; and by the Scale of Nature aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
to the God of Nature. But becauſe this
Belief of God's <hi>Being,</hi> is not ſo throughly rooted,
or at leaſt not excited as it ought, therefore ſo
much wickedneſs is practiſed in the World, even
at this day.</p>
               <p>If you look upon the wicked and ungodly,
that give up themſelves to all kind of Exceſs and
<hi>Senſuality,</hi> do they, think you, verily believe
there is a God? Doth not the Pſalmiſt tell us that
ſecret <hi>Atheiſm</hi> is the Root of that impiety that
is ſo viſible in the World? <hi>Pſal. 41. 2. The fool
hath ſaid in his Heart, there is no God;</hi> and
what follows? <hi>They are corrupt, they have done abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
works,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Or, if you look upon Men that are of a more
ſober Conſtitution, and it may be under ſome
outward Profeſſion, 1. Whence is it that they
are more careful to pleaſe Men, than to pleaſe
God; to have Man's favour, than God's? Or
2. Why can Men take liberty to ſin in ſecret,
when they think no Eye of Man obſerveth them?
3. Why are Men more careful to ingage the help
of a <hi>Creature</hi> with them in their undertakings, than
God's aſſiſtance? 4. Why are Men ſo little <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous</hi>
about a future State, and a World, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64312:41"/>
                  <hi>Judgment</hi> to come? 5. Why are Men ſo wholly
bent upon a <hi>Finite</hi> Good, which is found in the
Creature; and look ſo little after their <hi>chief</hi> Good?
6. Why are Men ſo ſelf-confident, and think
themſelves to be <hi>ſelf-ſufficient</hi> to ſubſiſt, and act
of themſelves? 7. Why is it Men make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
their <hi>ultimate</hi> End, and look not to an
higher End in the ſeveral Deſigns and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their Life? 8. Why are not Men thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and give God the praiſe of what good they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy?
Why is it when Men come to <hi>worſhip,</hi> they
worſhip as if they worſhip't not? care not with
what <hi>Slightneſs, Dulneſs, Formality</hi> it is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
care not to ingage their Hearts in what they
do? Whence is all this miſcarriage, and much
more that I might mention, but becauſe there
is a Root of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> ſtill in the Hearts of Men?
I ſay it again. Did Men truly, and throughly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the <hi>Being</hi> of God, do ye think they would
not prefer pleaſing him before the pleaſing of
Men? Would they not be afraid of ſecret, as well
as open ſins? Would they not principally <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi>
to engage him with them in their Affairs?
Would they not be more <hi>Solicitous</hi> about their
Final Account, and Eternal Eſtate? Would they
not ſeek after him who is the <hi>chief Good,</hi> more
then the Inferiour Good of this world? Would
they not put their <hi>truſt</hi> in him, and devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to him; &amp; look better to the manner of their
<hi>Worſhip,</hi> both as to Principle, Rule, and End, and
ſhew themſelves thankful for Mercies they enjoy?
As the Apoſtle ells the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> Cap. 2. 12. that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64312:42"/>
before their Converſion by the Goſpel, they
were not only without <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>Atheiſts</hi> in the World. And yet at <hi>Epheſus</hi> there
was the Temple of the great Goddeſs <hi>Diana,</hi>
whom they all worſhipt, and the Image which
fell down from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> Act. 19. 35. They
knew not the true God, and the true Worſhip
of him, and ſo are ſaid to be without God. And
I may apply this to our ſelves; whatever Men's
Tongues may ſpeak of God, and pretend of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
to him, yet it is evident Men's Actions
declare that they do not in their hearts believe his
Being. <hi>In their words they profeſs him, and in
their works they deny him,</hi> Tit. 1. <hi>ult.</hi> And there
is no greater Monſter in the Creation, than the
Speculative <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> unleſs it be the practical;
that ſaith there is a God, <hi>and yet lives without him:</hi>
and God's own People who fear him, truſt in
him, ſeek after him, obey him, &amp;c. yet they
would do all theſe with greater ſtrength, integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and freedom of Soul, if they did more Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
believe his Being, and had the impreſſion
of it more powerful upon their hearts. When <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haziah</hi>
ſent to enquire of <hi>Baalzebub,</hi> whether he
ſhould recover or not, what ſaid <hi>Elijah? Is it not
becauſe there is no God in Iſrael, that thou ſendeſt
to ènquire of Baal-zebub?</hi> 2 King. 1. Yes, there
was a God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but he was as if he was not
unto <hi>Ahaziah.</hi> Men cannot nullifie God's Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in it ſelf, but they may nullifie it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
As the Heathen Idols they were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>Nothings,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith of them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 4.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64312:42"/>
yet when Men Worſhips them, truſted in
them, and gave Divine Honour to them, they
made them Godds. So on the other-hand, they
not honouring, acknowledging, reverencing,
and truſting in the true God, do make him as
nothing. For it is only thoſe that glorifie him
as God that do truly own and believe his Being.
Yea, those Duties that are more properly Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical,
and not ſo expreſly contained in the Law
of Nature, yet the belief we gather to our ſelves,
of the Being of God from the Creation of the
World, may much influence us that live under the

Nature. For that Light that declares to Man.
There is a God that made the World, declares
alſo a Providence, that he governs the World. If
he governs the World he
governs it in Wiſdom;<note place="margin">Etenim ſi Deus eſt, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique providens eſt ut Deus. Nec aliter po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ei Divinitas at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribui. <hi>&amp;c. Lact. de ira Dei. Cap.</hi> 9.</note> if in

is governed according
to the reſpective <hi>Principles</hi>
of their ſeveral Natures. And
therefore Man muſt be govern'd as a <hi>rational</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And he cannot be ſo governed but by a Law,
and that Law enforced by <hi>Rewards</hi> on one hand,
and <hi>Puniſhments</hi> on the other. Now either this
Law thus enforced is found in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or
no where,</p>
               <p>There is no Book can pretend to ſtand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
with the Scripture, exſtant in the World,
fot the <hi>Turkiſh Alchoran,</hi> that is but of late years, and
Man hath been under God's Government from the
beginning. And moſt know by what Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures
it obtained any credit; and the ſeveral <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities</hi>
contained in it; and what a ſenſual hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
it propoſeth to them that receive it. How
it hath been from the beginning enforced upon
people by the Sword. And never confirmed by
thoſe many undoubted Miracles, which the
Truths of the Scriptures have been.</p>
               <p>But I need not enlarge on this Subject. There
having been ſo many Learned Pens already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
herein, eſpecially that <hi>Hononred Knight,</hi>
whoſe worthy Book concerning the <hi>Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
of receiving the Scriptures for the Word of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64312:44"/>
God, doth juſtly add new Honour to Himſelf,
and a great Confirmation to the Truth.</p>
               <p>2. The Goſpel calls upon Men to come to
Chriſt, and to believe in him as the Saviour of
the World: Now the powerful Sence of a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
upon the Heart, will Excite and Influence
Men thereunto. And the want of this I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as one great Reaſon why Chriſt is preached ſo
much in vain. When Conſcience is awakened,
then the Innate Notion of a <hi>Deity</hi> that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as it were aſleep, begins to awake. And
then Men begin to fear, and the Sence of Sin, and
Judgment to come, makes them enquire after a
way of Reconciliation; and ſo Men are brought
to Chriſt as the way, according to the notice they
have of him in the Goſpel. So that as he that
cometh to God, muſt firſt <hi>believe that God is,</hi> as
we read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. So he that cometh to Chriſt,
muſt be brought to him by an operative Belief of
the Being of God.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> came to <hi>Athens</hi> to preach Chriſt
to them, he firſt inſtructed them concerning the
true God, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. whom he declares to them
to be the Maker of the World, <hi>ver. 24. God
that made the World, and all things therein,</hi> &amp;c.
Here begins true <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> Men are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
but in Name, till they come to Chriſt by true
Faith, and they come not to him till the <hi>Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Belief of God's Being doth excite them to it.
As the dark Notions the <hi>Heathen</hi> had concerning
God did lead them to offer Sacrifice to him,
when they feared he was offended; So much more
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64312:44"/>
will the clearer knowledg of his Being, and the
fear of his Wrath ſend thoſe that live under the
Goſpel, to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the true Sacrifice and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So that whiles I have been demonſtrating a</hi>
Deity <hi>from the Works of Creation, I hope I have</hi>
collaterally <hi>been ſerving the great Deſign of the
Goſpel of bringing home ſinners to Jeſus Chriſt.
As a Learned Man ſpeaks to
this purpoſe;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Jackſon,</hi> Vol. 1. p. 874.</note> The ingrafted
Notion is the Matter or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
out of which God's Spirit
raiſeth the entire and right frame of Faith, as it
did the frame and faſhion of this viſible World out
of that Maſs, which was firſt without Form, though
created by him.</p>
               <p>3. So Repentance is hereby promoted alſo.
When men are throughly convinced that God is,
they then begin to bethink themſelves of their
wayes; how they have carried it towards him;
how obſervant they have been of his Law; how
they have anſwered his <hi>end</hi> in their Creation.</p>
               <p>And hence now Repentance doth take its firſt
riſe; What, ſaith the Sinner, if there be a God,
as I now clearly find there is, <hi>wo is me</hi> that I have
thus ſinned againſt him, and have taken no more
notice of him! Alas, I have lived without him
in the World; I have been concerning my ſelf
about the Creatures; and have little thought of
God my Creator, and had as little belief of his
Being. Alas! what ſhall I do? How ſhall I poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
eſcape? I cannot flee from him for he is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64312:45"/>
                  <hi>God.</hi> I will now judge and condemn my ſelf;
I will mourn bitterly; I will lament my Folly
and Ignorance; I will go to him, and ſay, Lord,
<hi>I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and before thee:</hi> I
am thy Creature, and the Work of thine Hands,
yet have <hi>rebelled</hi> againſt thee. As <hi>Balaam</hi> went
on confidently, tlll his eyes were opened, and he
ſaw the Angel with the drawn Sword; but then
ſaith the Text, He <hi>bowed down his head, and fell
flat on his face;</hi> Then he confeſſeth, <hi>I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and if it diſpleaſe thee, I will go back again,</hi>
Numb. 22. 31, 34. When ſinners eyes are ſo
far opened that they can behold, and do power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
believe the Being of God, it is the firſt ſtep
towards their <hi>return</hi> and <hi>repentance.</hi> And the
Works of Creation may be ſerviceable to this
end. Though they cannot lead men of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
either to that knowledg of God, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of Sin, as might effect <hi>evangelical</hi> Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
yet the belief, and ſenſe of a Deity that
may reſult from thence, may be the firſt ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it. And we know how God brought <hi>Job</hi>
to <hi>abhor himſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes,</hi> by
ſetting before him the glory and greatneſs of his
Being in the ſeveral works of Creation, and
giving him a ſpiritual ſight of himſelf therein; as
we read in the five laſt Chapters of that Book.
So that Repentance may not only be helpt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
as to its firſt <hi>beginning</hi> in the hearts of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent,
but furthered alſo in the Hearts of true
Saints.</p>
               <p>4. Taking up the <hi>Croſs</hi> of Chriſt; which we
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64312:45"/>
read of in the Scriptures, but not in the Works of
Nature. However the knowledge we have of
God's Being from thoſe Works, will further this
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Duty. For it is certain, what-ever it is
that ſtrengthens this grand <hi>Principle</hi> in us, that
<hi>God</hi> is, will enable us the better to ſuffer Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And upon the full belief of this did ſo
many thouſand Martyrs offer up their lives, as I
ſaid before, as knowing that it was for God's
ſake, and from him they ſhould have a reward.</p>
               <p>Was there no God, it was madneſs and folly in
them to have ſo ſuffered; and had they not well
believed it, they would not have been able to
ſuffer. <hi>To you it is given,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle,
firſt to <hi>believe,</hi> and then to <hi>ſuffer,</hi> Phil. 1. 29. It
is ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Heb. 11. 27. <hi>He endured as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him that is inviſible.</hi> And my Text ſaith, The
<hi>inviſible Things of God,</hi> and his <hi>God-head</hi> are ſeen
in the Works of Creation; ſo that the ſeeing of
the Inviſible God, even in the Works of God,
as well as his Word, may enable us the better to
endure ſuffering. And however Atheiſtical Men
may account it folly to ſuffer, yet from this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
believed, That God is, a Chriſtian can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
his ſufferings for God to be moſt ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
upon the grounds of trueſt Reaſon.</p>
               <p>And if you underſtand taking up <hi>Chriſt's Croſs</hi>
as ſome do, for the <hi>crucifixion</hi> of the Fleſh;
though this be alſo an <hi>Evangelical Duty,</hi> yet it is
furthered and promoted by a practical believing
the Being of God; to which the Works of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
do contribute much. As <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64312:46"/>
believing God's Being, doth open a wide Door
of Liberty to the Fleſh; ſo the true believing it
will engage Man to reſtrain and crucifie it. As
when there was no King in <hi>Iſrael, Every Man did
that which was right in his own eyes;</hi> much more
if men believe not there is a <hi>God</hi> in Heaven. But
now the ſetting of an <hi>Almighty</hi> Infinite God, the
Creator of the World, in the view of the Soul,
How doth this daſh ſin out of countenance, as it
did in <hi>Joſeph? How can I commit this wickedneſs
and ſin againſt God?</hi> What ſhall I ſin againſt and
before that God which made Heaven and Earth?
that God that hath ſtampt the <hi>Characters</hi> of his
Being round about me, upon me, and within
me? If there be a God, as I ſee the undeniable
evidence of it in his Works; Shall I maintain an
<hi>Idol-Luſt</hi> as a falſe god in mine own heart? And
ſhall he, who is the <hi>ſupream Being,</hi> find any thing
ſet up in my mind above him? and he that is the
<hi>chief Good,</hi> find any Good ſtanding as Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
with him in my Affections? And that God
that made all things for himſelf, ſhall I not live
unto him as my <hi>ultimate</hi> End, and live no more
to my ſelf in the ſerving of the Luſts of mine
own Heart and Mind?</p>
               <p>4. If we ſpeak of thoſe <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
which are the Ordinances of <hi>Divine</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and not made known by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
yet we may derive ſtrength from Nature's
Light, to enforce their Authority upon our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
Though we cannot do it <hi>ex antecedenti,</hi>
becauſe the Light of Nature doth not reveal
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64312:46"/>
them; yet we may do it a <hi>conſequenti,</hi> ſeeing they
are acknowledged from the Scripture to be the
<hi>Ordinances</hi> of God. For the <hi>Light</hi> of Nature
tells men there is a God, it then tells men this
God ought to be worſhipped; now the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that Chriſtians receive as the Word of God,
tell men that theſe Inſtitutions are his Commands
and Rule for Worſhip; and therefore the very
Light of Nature that declares a God to us, doth
alſo thereby urge us to give obedience, that
therein we may give worſhip to him. I deny
not but God is to be obeyed and worſhipped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a newer and more <hi>Evangelical</hi> account, as our
Redeemer in Jeſus Chriſt, and as we are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
by his Blood; yet a Chriſtian may and
ought to ſtrengthen his Obligation to Obedience
herein, from the evidence he finds of God's
Being, and ſo of his Sovereignty over his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
from the Works of his Creation. For as
when we find an <hi>Inſtitution</hi> upon a moral Duty
evidenced by the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> that <hi>Law</hi> is
ſtrengthned thereby; ſo we may derive Strength
from the Law of Nature, to make thoſe <hi>Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
that are not contained therein, more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
to us. As God himſelf doth confirm this
Truth when he ſpeaks to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Levit. 19. 30.
<hi>Ye ſhall keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,
I am the Lord.</hi> The true owning God's
Being, that he is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the <hi>Lord,</hi> will ſtrongly
oblige us to give obedience to Worſhip, that is,
of pure Inſtitution. The firſt Commandment
of the Law, well received, gives life and vigour
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64312:47"/>
to the Second, that ſpeaks of this Inſtituted Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>5. Or Laſtly; The believing the fulfilling what
God hath ſpoken in his Word; and that the
Counſels of his Mind revealed therein ſhall take
place, is another Goſpel-Duty. Now when we
believe his <hi>Being</hi> from the Creation of the
World, and there ſee how his Word was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
when he ſaid, <hi>Let there be Light,</hi> and let
<hi>there be a Firmament,</hi> &amp;c. and it was ſo: We
may hence ſtrengthen our Faith concerning the
accompliſhment of his Word that is written;
whether the Word of Promiſe to his Children, or
Threatning to his Adverſaries. When <hi>Sarah</hi>
doubted the fulfilling God's Promiſe to her;
<hi>What,</hi> ſaid the Angel, <hi>Is any thing too hard for
Jehovah?</hi> Which Name of God we do not read
of until his Creation was finiſhed, and he had
given being to all his Works; as appears by <hi>Gen.</hi>
2. 4. being before that called <hi>Elohim.</hi> Now <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,</hi>
that gave <hi>being</hi> to the Works of Creation,
can he not alſo give <hi>being</hi> to his Word? Can
there be greater difficulty in the fulfilling of his
Word, than in creating all Things out of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?
After God had ſet before <hi>Job</hi> the Works
of Creation, <hi>Job</hi> thence concludes, <hi>I know thou
canſt do every thing,</hi> Job 42. 2. And the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi>
having ſaid, <hi>Pſal. 33. 6. By the Word of the
Lord were the Heavens made,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Verſ. 9.
For be ſpake, and it was done; he commanded, and
it ſtood faſt:</hi> He hence makes this Inference;
That <hi>his Counſel ſhall ſtand for ever, and the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64312:47"/>
thoughts of his Heart to all Generations.</hi> His ſecret
Counſel ſhall take place; but that is not the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our Faith, but his Counſel revealed in
his Word; And we may ſtrengthen our Faith
concerning it, by looking upon him as the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of the World. For when and whereſoever
God ſpeaks, his Word never returns in vain;
when he ſpake in the Creation of the World, his
Word took place; and ſo ſhall his Word in the
Scripture, where he is ſpeaking in every Age of
the World.</p>
               <div type="inference">
                  <head>Inference.</head>
                  <p>Now from all this I have ſaid, we may conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how much it doth concern us to revive and
ſtrengthen upon our Souls the impreſſions of
God's Being. For though theſe <hi>Impreſſions</hi> be fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally
in every Man's Nature, yet in ſome
they are more lively and operative than in others.
And it is no eaſie thing to preſerve the powerful
Senſe of a Deity upon our hearts; I mean, ſuch
a Senſe as may be prevalent to reſiſt <hi>temptations,</hi>
and overpower the corruption of Nature. For
we ſee, for the moſt part, how this Seed of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is choaked in the hearts of men. For this
end let God be much in your ſight; behold him
in the Works of his Creation and Providence,
and in all your wayes acknowledg him; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
him in all your Affairs; converſe much with
him in Prayer; endeavour to bring your <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>
under more powerful Convictions of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64312:48"/>
neceſſity of his Being. And eſpecially let Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
ſtrengthen their Faith in it from the Word
of God, and the Evidence of the Spirit in their
Hearts. For it is an Act of Faith truly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
God's Being, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 3. And it is
one work that the Spirit is converſant about in
the Hearts of Saints to ſtrengthen this belief, and
to make it more efficacious upon their Hearts.
For this Faith hath its degrees, as well as that
which hath Chriſt, the Promiſe, or Heaven for its
Object. And by feeling the Divine Influences
of the Spirit upon our Souls, we may be more
confirmed in this belief, than by any Arguments
from Reaſon. He that would have the <hi>Boughs</hi> and
<hi>Branches</hi> thrive, doth ſeek to cheriſh the Root; So
all <hi>Religion</hi> growing originally out of this Root,
<hi>viz.</hi> the effectual belief of God's <hi>Being,</hi> we
ſhould be daily <hi>ſtrengthening</hi> it in our ſelves. And
as the withering of the <hi>Branches</hi> ariſeth from the
decay and rotting of the Root; ſo, if it be well
examined, mens decay in Religion, their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
of Duty, and falling into <hi>immoralities</hi> and
vicious practices, doth radically ſpring from the
decay of the belief, and lively ſenſe of God's Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in their Souls.</p>

               <p>BUt yet further to improve the Doctrine in
hand, I ſhall next ſpeak of ſome other Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which are more expreſly in the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the great parts of Natural Worſhip, and
which a Chriſtian, by conſidering God as the
Creator of the World, is obliged to perform.</p>
               <p>1. Is, to humble and debaſe our ſelves before
him: Conſidering him in the greatneſs of his
Works, which yet are but the <hi>ſhadow</hi> of his
Greatneſs. <hi>And if all Nations before him are but
as the drop of a Bucket, and the duſt of the Ballance;</hi>
How humbly ſhould this make us to walk before
him, and come unto him? When <hi>David</hi> looked
upon part of God's Creation, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. it had
this effect upon him, to make him ſhrink into a
narrow compaſs of ſelf-eſteem; <hi>O Lord, our
Lord, how excellent is thy Name in all the Earth!
thou haſt ſet thy Glory above the Heavens.</hi> And
<hi>verſ. 3. When I conſider thy Heavens, the Work of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64312:49"/>
thy Fingers, the Moon and the Stars which thou
haſt ordained: What is Man that thou art mindful
of him,</hi> &amp;c? And it was the courſe that God
took with <hi>Job</hi> to take down his Spirit and to lay
him at his foot, to ſet himſelf before him as the
Creator of the World. <hi>Job 38. 3, 4. Gird up
now thy loyns like a man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Where waſt thou
when I laid the Foundations of the Earth? Who
hath laid the meaſures thereof, if thou knoweſt? Or
who hath ſtretched the Line upon it,</hi> &amp;c? and ſo he
proceeds in the following Chapters; and it had
this effect, for he was brought hereby to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
himſelf vile, <hi>chap.</hi> 40. 4. and to <hi>ahhor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> Job 42. 6. The

                  </note> and that meant
upon the account of his Parvity
and Nothingneſs compared with the great God,
as well as his ſinfulneſs and folly. And to lie in
the Duſt, is the deepeſt expreſſion of an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
Soul. Or, as one <hi>gloſſeth</hi> upon the words;
<hi>It grieves me what I have ſpoke againſt the great
God; Cum ipſe pulvis ſim &amp; abjectiſſimus,</hi> when
as I my ſelf am but Duſt, and moſt contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Can a Man behold God in the vaſt Works of
his Creation, and not be ſelf-debaſed, and as it
were <hi>ſelf-annihilated</hi> thereby; and ſay as one
ſpeaks, <hi>Lord, thou art an Abyſs of Being, and I
of Nothing;</hi> eſpecially conſidering how infinitely
his Greatneſs tranſcends them all. They tell us,
that the Earth is but as a <hi>Punctum,</hi> a ſmall Point
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64312:49"/>
in compariſon of the Heavens; but Earth and
Heaven both are leſs than a <hi>Punctum</hi> compared
with the great God. For there is ſome propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
betwixt Finite and Finite, but none betwixt
Finite and Infinite. And therefore the Prophet
<hi>Iſaiah,</hi> to expreſs this infinite diſproportion,
ſpeaks thus, <hi>Chap. 40. 17. All Nations before him
are nothing; and they are accounted to him leſs than
nothing, and vanity.</hi> Which is to ſhew that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and the Works of his Creation there is
indeed no proportion at all.</p>
               <p>So that our minds may behold God's <hi>greatneſs</hi>
in the greatneſs of his Works; and much more in
the <hi>littleneſs</hi> and <hi>nothingneſs</hi> of theſe Works com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with his Greatneſs; and from both ſhould
lay us very low, and humble us deeply before
him. It made <hi>Solomon</hi> have a mean opinion of
the great Houſe he had built, conſidering the
great God that was to dwell in it; 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 27.
<hi>Behold, the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee,
much leſs this Houſe that I have builded.</hi> It is
Man's <hi>unacquaintedneſs</hi> with the great Creator of
the World, that makes him admire any great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in himſelf, or in the greateſt things of this

Men that have true greatneſs of mind are not ſo
apt to wonder, as men of little Souls. So that
this acquaintance with the great God will <hi>greaten</hi>

2. We ought from hence alſo be led to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
upon him; for he that made Heaven
and Earth, muſt needs be ſufficient to help us in
all caſes whatſoever. The Heathens are ſaid to
<hi>truſt in a God that could not ſave,</hi> Iſa. 45. 20. And
the Reaſon is given, becauſe their gods did not
<hi>make Heaven and Earth,</hi> as we read, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18.
He that brought all things out of the Abyſs of
<hi>non-entity</hi> into Being, can raiſe us out of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
depth of affliction and miſery. He that ſaid,
<hi>Let there be Light,</hi> and made the Darkneſs vaniſh
before it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is able to bring us out of the greateſt
darkneſs of trouble. He that made the Waters
retreat from <hi>covering</hi> the Earth, can diſcharge us
of the <hi>Waters</hi> of Sorrow and Affliction, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we ſometimes ſeem to be covered or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> comforts her ſelf in ſuch
a proſpect of God; <hi>Pſal. 124. 8. Our help is in
the Name of the Lord who made Heaven and Earth.</hi>
That is to ſay, Our help is in one that is All-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
and upon whom we may ſafely depend.</p>
               <p>One great cauſe of the Saints diſtruſtful heart-fainting
fears, is, the not conſidering this: <hi>Haſt
thou not known? Haſt thou not heard that the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the
Earth fainteth not?</hi> Iſa. 40. 28. Why then
doth <hi>Jacob</hi> faint in his diſtreſs? And when we
are afraid of Man, it is becauſe we <hi>forget the
Lord our Maker, that ſtretched forth the Heavens,
and laid the Foundations of the Earth,</hi> Iſa. 51. 13.
Did we well remember this, it would ſtrengthen
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64312:50"/>
our Faith, and vanquiſh our Fears; and make us
able, under the greateſt Difficulties, and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and Deaths, to commit our Souls to him as
a faithful Creator, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 19. For as in the
Works of Creation, we behold him a powerful
Creator, ſo in Chriſt Jeſus, and the Covenant
made with us in him, we may behold him alſo a
<hi>faithful Creator,</hi> and ſo be encouraged to depend
upon him, and commit our ſelves to him.</p>
               <p>3. Hereupon we ought to have an holy <hi>awe</hi>
and fear of him. As the conſidering God the
<hi>Creatour</hi> of the World ſhould diſpel diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
fear, ſo it ought to beget an <hi>awful</hi> fear of him.
All appearances of God are tremendous to the
Creature. As when he appeared in Tranſient
Viſions to the Prophets, it ſtruck them with
dread, as we read of <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 10. And
thoſe Beams of Glory that ſhone forth in
Chriſt's Transfiguration made the Diſciples
fear, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 6. So verily his appearances in
in the Works of Creation
are wonderful and dreadful.<note place="margin">Aquin. 1. 2. q. 41. Art. 4.</note>
Here we may firſt wonder
and then fear, as the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have made <hi>Admiration</hi> one of the kinds of
Fear. Greatneſs and Majeſty are apt to ſtrike
this Heart with Fear; and both theſe are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
written upon God's Creation. What can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
he do either for a Man, or againſt him that
is the Maker of the World? what is exceeding
high hath a dread in it. As in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Viſion
of the Wheels, it's ſaid, <hi>Chap. 1. 18. As for their
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64312:51"/>
Rings, they were ſo high that they were dreadful.</hi>
In the Creation of the World we behold the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity
of God's Majeſty; and his Wiſdom, and
Greatneſs in a Stupendious Elevation. As <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad</hi>
tells <hi>Job,</hi> Job 25. 2. ſpeaking of God, <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and Fear are with him.</hi> Theſe are joyned
together as Cauſe and Effect. And he ſhews <hi>Job</hi>
this Dominion of God in the Works of his Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>He maketh peace in his high places.</hi> All the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the upper World, quietly ſubject to the
Creator's Law. And <hi>verſ. 3. Is there any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of his Armies?</hi> &amp;c. which are the Hoſts in
Heaven and Earth, as the Creatures are called,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 1. Here is God's Dominion, which

               <p>Yet this is a Truth; the Works of God's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhould ſtrike our Hearts with a <hi>reverend</hi> Fear
of the Creatour; which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> exhorts
men to, <hi>Let all the Earth fear the Lord; let all the
Inhabitants of the World ſtand in awe of him: For
he ſpake, and it was done; he commanded, and it
ſtood faſt.</hi> Oh, how ſhould the whole World
ſtand in awe of ſuch a <hi>Being!</hi> Our very <hi>praiſes</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:64312:51"/>
are to be mixt with fear. He is therefore ſaid to
be <hi>fearful in praiſes,</hi> Exod. 15. 11. For thoſe
Excellencies of his Works for which we praiſe
him, have ſuch Impreſſions of his Glory and
Power upon them, that may make men fear while
they are praiſing of them.</p>
               <p>But becauſe I would ſtill make my Diſcourſe
to ſerve the Deſign of true <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
add, That this Fear ought not to be afright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or meerly aſtoniſhing, to enſlave the Soul, or
drive Man into fond <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> as it did the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
but ſuch as may ſuit a ſtate of <hi>Sonſhip,</hi> and
may be proper to him that is not only our <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
but our <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and Father in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.
And by that Principle of Grace we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of him as our Redeemer, to fear him as
our Creatour.</p>
               <p>Upon this account alſo we owe him <hi>Praiſe</hi> and
<hi>Admiration. 1. Praiſe;</hi> It is the <hi>ultimate</hi> end
of theſe Works of Creation that the Creator may
be praiſed in them; and it is the <hi>ultimate</hi> end of
Man to give Glory and Praiſe to him. After
God had made and finiſhed the reſt of his Works,
he laſtly made Man, that he might have a <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
to contemplate the Works of his hands, and
praiſe him in them all, and by him reduce all his
Works back again to himſelf. And without
queſtion <hi>Adam,</hi> as ſoon as he had a Being, and
was placed in the <hi>Theatre</hi> of this World, he ſaw
the Creator in his Works, and found in himſelf a
<hi>Principle</hi> that naturally led him to adore and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:64312:52"/>
And as this Principle is renewed in any Man,
and the Image of God reſtored to him, ſo is he
diſpoſed to the performance of it. How often
do we find <hi>David</hi>'s heart in a rapture of praiſe
upon the <hi>contemplation</hi> of God's Workmanſhip in
the Worlds Creation; as we may find in <hi>Pſal. 8.
1. Pſal. 33. 6, 7. Pſal.</hi> 104. 24. And when he
calls upon irrational Creatures to praiſe their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
as in <hi>Pſal. 148. Praiſe him Sun and Moon,
praiſe him all ye Stars of Light: Praiſe him ye
Heavens of Heavens, and ye Waters that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Heavens:</hi> And thence he comes down
to this lower World, <hi>verſ. 7. Praiſe the Lord
from the Earth; ye Dragons, and all Deeps,</hi> &amp;c.
All this is but to quicken up his own heart to that
Duty which was his, rather than theirs. And ſo
all God's Works are ſaid to praiſe him, as they
become to Man both the <hi>Motives</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> of
his Praiſe.</p>
               <p>Had this Creation ſprung from God, as it were,
by Natural <hi>Emanation,</hi> or neceſſity of Nature, as
ſome have ſaid, as Light out of the Sun, or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from the Spring.</p>
               <p>Or had he made it, as men build an Houſe,
becauſe he needed an Habitation, or ſome ſervice
from the Creatures exiſtent therein, it might ſeem
to be ſome <hi>eclipſe</hi> to the Glory due to him. But
when he was led to it only by a moſt free Act of
his own Will, and the infinite goodneſs of his
Nature; this renders him therein infinitely praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:64312:52"/>
                  <hi>Epicurus</hi> that did not believe God to be either
the <hi>Creator</hi> or <hi>Governor</hi> of the World, yet ſaid
he ought to be <hi>magnified</hi> for the excellencies of
his <hi>Being;</hi> how much more ſhould he be adored
by us, who know that all things were made by
him, and behold an <hi>infinite</hi> goodneſs manifeſted
therein.</p>
               <p>And we may from the Creation learn theſe
three things concerning the Creator to commend
him to us. 1. Is, Self-ſufficiency. For he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted
of himſelf, and is truly
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,<note place="margin">Vide <hi>Lact.</hi> lib. 1. p. 29.</note> as the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
of <hi>Apollo</hi> once ſaid of
him, and was infinitely bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in himſelf before any Creature had a Being,
and the Creation added nothing to him. 2. All
Fulneſs and Perfection of Being exiſting in
him; for the Beings of all
Creatures,<note place="margin">Infinitum quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aam Eſſentiae Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagus. <hi>As</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcen <hi>ſpeaks of him.</hi>
                  </note> with their ſeveral
Perfections, did ſpring out
of his Being, as Rivers out of
the Sea. And therefore he
muſt needs have all Fulneſs
and Perfection of Being in
himſelf; as what-ever is in the Effect doth either
formally, vertually, or eminently pre-exiſt in the
Cauſe. <hi>Logicians</hi> that have reduced all natural
things under ten Heads or Predicaments, do well
leave out God as <hi>Ens tranſcendens,</hi> as a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Being. For he is infinitely above all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things, and his Nature infinitely differing
from theirs, though he comprehends all their
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64312:53"/>
perfections eminently in
himſelf.<note place="margin">God is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. And much to that purpoſe we may read in <hi>Dionyſ. Areop. De divinis nominibus.</hi>
                  </note> He is <hi>Eſſence, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
Life, Light, Wiſdom,
Act, Power,</hi> &amp;c. Yet not
according to what we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
of theſe things; And
therefore we muſt take heed
of forming finite Images and
Repreſentations of him in our Minds; as the
<hi>Heathen</hi> did of old form viſible Images of him
to worſhip him by. <hi>But to whom will you liken
me? ſaith the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 40. Though God,
ſpeaking in his Word to us finite Creatures, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
himſelf to us by finite Things;
<q>Se quaſi finitum finitis mentibus offert.</q>
Yet he is infinitely above all theſe things; and it
is a true rule, nothing can be predicated <hi>univo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi>
of God and the Creatures. 3. Alloſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to his People. For he that hath all Good emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
in himſelf, muſt needs be an All-ſufficient
Portion. For God, as one ſaith him, he is
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, He is all things that the Creature
is, and yet nothing that the Creature is. All
things are in him as in the Fountain; and he that
abides with God, and enjoyes him, he drinks at
the Fountain, whereas others drink at the Stream;
and at the Fountain the Waters are in their
greateſt <hi>ſweetneſs, fulneſs,</hi> and <hi>purity.</hi> And
though he hath communicated Being to ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
Creatures, yet he is not in the leaſt
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64312:53"/>
                  <hi>exhauſted</hi> in his own Being; no more than the Sun
is exhauſted in its Light, by thoſe ſtreams of
Light it is daily pouring forth upon the World.
In our <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi> we read a diſtinction of
<hi>Mundus Archetypus,</hi> and <hi>Mundus Emanationis:</hi>
The former is the Eternal God himſelf, and the
other is the Created World. So that what-ever
is in the World, was in God before as the <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type.</hi>
The Frame and Fabrick of it was firſt in
his own infinite Mind; and all the Good, Beauty,
Sweetneſs, that are ſcattered abroad among the
Creatures of the <hi>Univerſe,</hi> were all firſt tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
in himſelf; ſo that he muſt needs be All-ſufficient
to our Happineſs.</p>
               <p>For what-ever is the firſt Original of any Good,
hath the whole of that Good in it ſelf; as the
Sun that is the Original of Light, hath all Light
in it ſelf; and ſo the Sea, with reſpect to Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Now God is the Original of all that Good
that is in the Creature, of what-ever kind it is,
and therefore the whole of all Good is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
Here we have <hi>Unity</hi> bringing forth Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and all <hi>Plurality</hi> eminently comprehended
in Unity. As <hi>Du Bartas</hi> divinely to this purpoſe
ſpeaks;
<q>
                     <l>Ere Time,<note place="margin">Du Bart. firſt week, p. 5.</note> Form, Subſtance, Place,
to be themſelves attain'd;</l>
                     <l>All God in all things was, and All
in God remain'd.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:64312:54"/>
And hereupon alſo we may ſit down and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.
Though we want many good things that
are in the Creature, and which others enjoy, yet
we have them all eminently in him that is the
Fountain of all Good; and is the <hi>totum univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale,</hi>
the Univerſal whole of that partial and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Good that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
have in their ſeveral
Beings.<note place="margin">Omnia habeo, neque quicquam habeo, nihil cum eſt, nihil deeſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. <hi>Terent. Eunuch.</hi> Acts 2. <hi>This is true in Divinity.</hi>
                  </note> So that we need
not be overwhelmed with
ſorrow, when we meet with
loſſes of ſome created finite
Good, if we have the <hi>Lord</hi>
himſelf to be our God. That he is a Good ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to make the Soul happy, appears in this,
That the <hi>Angels</hi> are happy in God alone, who are
Spirits of wider Capacities than the Souls of Men.
Yea, God is his own Happineſs, much more is
he ſufficient to be the Creatures Happineſs.
Whereupon we ought to acquieſce in him.</p>
               <p>Now (to reduce this Duty alſo to Chriſtian
Practice) let every true Saint that is in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with God, praiſe this God as his God. Let
him look upon the great Creator of the World,
as ſtanding in a particular Relation to himſelf in
Jeſus Chriſt, and that infinite Goodneſs out of
which all created Good doth originally ſpring, to
be ingaged to him, to ſatisfie him, and make him
bleſſed for ever; as the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> calls the
Former of all things the Portion of <hi>Jacob, Jer.</hi>
10. 16. And by this he hath an advantage of lift
up the Praiſes of God to an higher degree than
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64312:54"/>
the Light of Nature could ever raiſe Man to;
when he ſhall praiſe him, not only as a Creator,
but as his God, and his Portion for ever. So
that Praiſe is due to him from us.</p>
               <p>But, 2. we owe him alſo the Duty of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
For ſeeing we cannot comprehend him
in the myſterious and glorious Works of his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
we ſhould therefore admire him. As one
having read an obſcure Author, and being askt
his Judgment about it, anſwered,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>What I have underſtood
in it is excellent, and ſo I judge alſo is what I have
not underſtood.</hi> Or rather, as one that having read
the Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> ſaid this of it, <hi>Non
Reprobo quod non Intelligo, ſed eo magis admiror,
quo minus aſſequor; I do not reject what I do not
underſtand, but the leſs I can underſtand the more I
wonder.</hi> By Admiration we give God the glory
of his Incomprehenſibleneſs.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. <hi>Dionyſ. Areop.</hi> De Divinis nominibus.</note>
Whereby (as one ſpeaks)
not only our Knowledge but
our Ignorance turns to his
Praiſe. This is that <hi>Act</hi> of
the Soul that beſt agrees to
<hi>Infinity.</hi> While the Soul is
admiring God, it is as it were
gone out of its own <hi>finitneſs</hi>
into his infinitneſs;<note place="margin">Quando mens ſe ad Deum cum amore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegre convertit, ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis &amp; Intellectus ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus reverberatus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligat. <hi>Iſagoge Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derii ad Myſt. Theol.</hi>
                  </note> where
it is gone beyond its depth;
as in the <hi>deep</hi> Ocean where
men may ſwim but cannot
wade. And hence it is that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64312:55"/>
the Works of God are ſo often ſaid in Scripture
to be <hi>wonderful Works,</hi> which ſhews they are
above Knowledg; and ſo they, and much more
their Maker, are the <hi>Objects</hi> of our Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Only, let me add here alſo, Let us admire him
as <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> not only to aſtoniſh our Reaſon,
but to the ſanctifying our Hearts. 1. Let our
<hi>admiration</hi> of him lead us to love him; and that
not only for what we know of him, but for that
alſo which is above our knowledg; and if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
to love him <hi>infinitely,</hi> which we come
neareſt to, when after all our love of him we are
ſtill wiſhing we could love him yet more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.</p>
               <p>2. It ſhould alſo lead us
infinitely to eſteem him,<note place="margin">Hic nec videri poteſt, viſu clarior eſt, nec comprehendi, tactu purior eſt; nec aeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mari, ſenſu major eſt, &amp; ideo ſic eum digne aeſtimamus, dum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aeſtimabilem dicimus. <hi>Cypr.</hi> De Idolorum Vanitate, <hi>p.</hi> 289.</note> and
to deſpiſe all things in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of him, and account
them as nothing; for ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they are compared
with him. Our higheſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
is of thoſe things
which we do not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.
Any <hi>Excellency,</hi> the
more we admire it, the more we eſteem it. As
the Eye that hath been gazing upon the <hi>Sun</hi> is
darkned to the ſight of other things. So the
Soul that is employed in the true beholding and
admiring the excellencies of God's <hi>Being,</hi> hath
thereby the <hi>glory</hi> of this World darkned to
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:64312:55"/>
3. Again, it ſhould lead the Soul forth with
ſtrong deſires to the knowledge and <hi>fruition</hi> of
him.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Knowledg</hi> of him; As things that are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
are moſt deſirable to be known. The
Mind of Man hath a natural propenſion to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
eſpecially to the knowledg of things great
and wonderful.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. Ariſt.</note> And the
<hi>Philoſophers</hi> defined Wiſdom
to be the <hi>knowledg of things
great and wonderful.</hi> And
admiration put them upon the ſtudy of them.
Firſt, They admired, and then ſearched. And
therefore it was well ſtiled, <hi>Principium Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiae;</hi>
the <hi>Original of Philoſophy.</hi> So God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Object of our <hi>admiration,</hi> it ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
our Minds to more diligent enquiries into
the knowledg of him. Although, he being an
<hi>infinite</hi> Object, we cannot comprehend him, yet
to ſearch after him ſo far as our finite capacity may
extend, and then ſit down and leave the reſt to
an holy admiration. As the Apoſtle prayes for
the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that they may <hi>know the Love of
Chriſt which paſſeth knowledg,</hi> Epheſ. 3. 18. So
though the infinite Being of God paſſeth Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
yet we ſhould ſearch into the knowledg of
him.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Fruition</hi> of him. For God is an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
not only to be known, but enjoyed. And
to enjoy him ſo far as we are capable in this Life,
and to ſend forth our earneſt Deſires to the fuller
<hi>fruition</hi> of him in the Life that is yet to come,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64312:56"/>
eſpecially ſeeing he is beſt known by enjoying,
as every good is. So that as the Mind is to travel
into the knowledg of him, as he is the moſt <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent</hi>
Object to be known, ſo is the will to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
after him as the <hi>chiefeſt</hi> Good to be enjoyed.
The admiring any Good, ſatisfies not, without
the enjoying it.</p>

And herein conſider. 1. That all things were
made by Him. 2. For Him.</p>
               <p>1. All things were made by him. So we have
it made known to us by <hi>Scripture</hi>-Revelation; as
<hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1. where the Apoſtle enters his Diſcourſe
of Chriſt from his Divinity. <hi>In the beginning was
the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
was God. All things were made by him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him was nothing made that was made.</hi> This
beginning is not the beginning of the Goſpel, as
the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſpeak, but the beginning of Time.
And all things made by him, are not the things
of the New Creation, but of the Firſt. But if
they cavil at this Text, becauſe they own not
Chriſt's Eternal God-head, and any preexiſtence
of him to his Incarnation; what can they ſay to
that in <hi>Coloſ. 1. 16. For by him were all things crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that are in Heaven, and that are in the Earth,

And in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 10. the laying the Foundation of
the Earth, and the making of the Heavens, is
expreſly attributed to Jeſus Chriſt. But I muſt
not divert to that Controverſie, only to ſhew how
the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World hath reſpect to Chriſt
as its Creator; not excluding the Father and the
Holy Ghoſt; for in all Works, <hi>ad extrà,</hi> they
work, as we ſay, <hi>indiviſim:</hi> yet according to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64312:57"/>
the <hi>order</hi> of their ſubſiſting, is the <hi>order</hi> of their
working; ſo all things are of the <hi>Father,</hi> through
the <hi>Son,</hi> by the <hi>Spirit.</hi> And the Creation of all
things ſeems moſt properly to appertain to the
<hi>ſecond Perſon.</hi> For he being the Firſt and Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Off-ſpring of his Father, it belongs to him
to propagate and communicate of his Being in
the things that are made, which are therefore
called the <hi>Off-ſpring of God.</hi> As the Apoſtle
quotes the Heathen Poet, ſaying, <hi>Acts 17. We
are alſo his Off-ſpring:</hi> And ſaith it alſo himſelf
in the next words, <hi>Foraſmuch as we are the Off-ſpring
of God.</hi> And not onely Men, but all
created Beings may be ſtiled his Off-ſpring,
as they are the Finite Emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his Infinite Being.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Magne parens mundi,</hi> As the Poet ſpeaks of God.</note>
And the Heathens therefore
did ſtile <hi>God</hi> the great Father
of the World.<note place="margin">Col. 1. 15. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> And Jeſus
Chriſt is called by the Apoſtle
<hi>the firſt-Born of every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
or of all Creation. So
called, as ſome conceive, with reſpect to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Generation, and the Creation that in time
ſprung from him. He was brought forth by an
Eternal Generation, and then by him was the
<hi>Generation</hi> of all the things of Time. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
his Being Eternally and Infinitely to
his Son, and then by him communicates of his
Being Finitely, and in time to the Creatures. His
communication of himſelf to his Son, is by an
<hi>immanent</hi> Act, wherein God did not go out of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64312:58"/>
himſelf; and ſo by him gave Being to the Creation
in thoſe <hi>Tranſient</hi> Acts, wherein God doth work
<hi>ad extra,</hi> and goes out of himſelf. Now what
may Chriſtians obſerve from hence.</p>
               <p>1. In general. That the Creator of the World
is alſo the Redeemer of it. He that made all
things, is alſo the <hi>Reſtorer</hi> of all things. The
collapſed ruined World, is put into his hand to
raiſe and renew it that firſt made it. As we read
Heb. 1. 2. <hi>He is appointed Heir of all things, by
whom God made the Worlds.</hi> He had an original
Title to be Heir as Creator; but hath a new Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
given him as Redeemer; and this he executes
in the Government of the World.</p>
               <p>2. More particularly. We may obſerve that
it is the Infinite Creator of the World who hath
cloathed himſelf with the fleſh of Man, and
made it to ſubſiſt <hi>perſonally</hi> in himſelf. Here we
may behold this great <hi>Myſtery, Finiteneſs,</hi> and
<hi>In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inity; Mortal,</hi> and <hi>Immortality; Divinity,</hi>
and <hi>Humanity;</hi> the <hi>Creator</hi> and the <hi>Creature</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in one Perſon. As the Evangeliſt firſt ſpeaks
of Chriſt as the Creator of all things, <hi>John</hi> 1. 3.
and then as aſſuming our fleſh, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. The
<hi>Word</hi> that made all things, afterwards ſpake and
dwelt perſonally in humane fleſh.</p>
               <p>And Man's Nature being a <hi>Syſtem</hi> of the whole
Creation, he did in a manner cloath himſelf with
it, in his aſſuming our fleſh. As one of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
to this purpoſe ſpeaks; <hi>Incarnatio eſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatio
totius Univerſi in Divinam Perſonam;</hi> Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
is the lifting up the whole Univerſe into
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64312:58"/>
Divine Perſon. Which taken in a qualified
ſenſe is true. And in aſſuming our fleſh, How
many wonders do here meet together? To ſee
the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> ſtooping ſo low, is one wonder;
to ſee the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> raiſed ſo high, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
to ſee Man's ſinful Nature aſſumed without
ſin, is a third; to ſee the Angelical Nature paſt
by that ſtood neareſt to God, and Man's Nature
aſſumed that ſtood farther off, is a fourth; to ſee
the <hi>Creator</hi> aſſuming the Properties of a Creature,
which is to be <hi>finite, paſſive, dependent,</hi> &amp;c. and
the Creature aſſumed into the Properties of the
Creator, which is to be <hi>Infinite, Almighty, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent,</hi>
is a fifth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So
that God is hereby Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Athanaſ.</note>
and Man, as it were,
Deified, as one ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>3. We may further obſerve, and that with
great delight, how it is the Creator of all things
that is become the Head of the Church. Which
the Apoſtle ſuggeſts in <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. and <hi>verſ.</hi> 18.
compared; <hi>By him were all things created, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Viſible or Inviſible,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and he is the Head of
the Body of the Church;</hi> an Head, not only by way
of <hi>Government</hi> to rule over it, but by way of
Spiritual Union to influence it, and dwell in it as
the Head in the Body. To ſee the Infinite Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
humble himſelf, to look down upon his
Creatures, is taken notice of by the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> as a
great condeſcent, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113. 5, 6. But to take
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64312:59"/>
any of them into a nearneſs, into an oneneſs with
himſelf, is yet far greater.</p>
               <p>He firſt came into a <hi>natural</hi> Union with us in
aſſuming our Nature, and into a <hi>legal</hi> Union with
us, by becoming our Surety; and then comes
into a <hi>myſtical</hi> Union, by making us Members of
his Body through the Spirit. And this <hi>Myſtical
Union</hi> is alſo ſet forth by a <hi>Marriage Union,</hi> Epheſ.
5. 32. And is not this wonderful, to ſee the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to match himſelf with a Creature, and that
not of the higheſt Order, but with Man; and
not with him neither, when at his beſt, but when
degenerated and corrupted. Should we ſee a
great King take a poor Maid from the Dunghil
and match himſelf to her, it could ſcarce be a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of this. For our <hi>Maker</hi> to become our
<hi>Husband,</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 5. our Reaſons
cannot comprehend it. Ambition it ſelf can
hardly aſpire to ſuch a thing.</p>
               <p>And now what an honour is this to the Church
to have ſuch an Head and Husband? and what
<hi>ſecurity</hi> alſo to be under the <hi>Headſhip</hi> and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the Creator of the World? He that
created all things, can <hi>create</hi> Salvation for it, when
there is no viſible matter or means out of which to
bring it. And he that gave Being to the firſt Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
can and will raiſe up and perfect his New
Creation in his Church, which he will effect by
this Union it hath with himſelf as the <hi>Head</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
And the aſſurance hereof the Saints have in
that light of the Knowledg of God that hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſhined into their hearts. For this New
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64312:59"/>
Creation begins in Light as the firſt did, which
the Apoſtle takes notice of 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 6. God who
commanded Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs, hath
ſhined into our hearts.</hi> And as he proceeded in
the firſt <hi>Creation,</hi> till the whole was made perfect,
ſo will he do in the New; where he hath <hi>begun</hi> a
good Work he will perfect it; he will proceed
from that firſt Light of Grace wherein he ſhined
into the Soul to the <hi>perfection</hi> of his Work in the
eternal Light of Glory.</p>
               <p>4. Obſerve alſo that our Reconciler to God is
he that made the World. As the Apoſtle in
<hi>Col.</hi> 1. 1. ſpeaks of Chriſt as the Creator of the
World; <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. and then as our Reconciler by
the Blood of his Croſs, <hi>v. 20. And having made
peace by the Blood of his Croſs, by him to reconcile
all things unto himſelf.</hi> How may this ſtrengthen
our Faith in Chriſt's Blood, ſeeing it is the Blood
of him that made the World. As it doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<hi>ſtupendious</hi> love that the Creator ſhould die
for his Creature; ſo it may aſſure us that his
death muſt needs be infinitely meritorious. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law, the Blood of Creatures was ſhed
for the People, but that could of it ſelf merit
nothing; but now under the <hi>New-Teſtament</hi>
there is the Blood of the Creator ſhed for us:
Here is the Lord of all Life himſelf dying, and
he that gave Being to all things emptying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and as it were, made nothing. What
unſpeakable Merit muſt hence ariſe for us! Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
the merit of the <hi>Creator</hi> muſt needs infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
exceed all demerit of the <hi>Creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:64312:60"/>
And as hence we may conclude an <hi>infinite</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
ſo we may obſerve the fitneſs of him that
was the <hi>Creator</hi> to make Reconciliation for us.
Who ſo fit to look after poor loſt Creatures as he
that made them? He had the greateſt <hi>property</hi> in
us, and therefore was concerned moſt to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
us. As when the Sheep are wandred, the
<hi>Praprietor</hi> is the fitteſt Perſon to take care for the
bringing them home again. So that as our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
he had not only <hi>Jus Proprietatis,</hi> the Right
of Property to redeem us, but alſo <hi>Jus Idonei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis,</hi>
the Right of Fitneſs alſo.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Laſtly;</hi> We may hence take notice of the
Bounty and Goodneſs of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
We may ſee it in the Creation of the
World, which is every where filled with the
Effects hereof. When he made the World, he
ſhewed not only his Power, but the <hi>infinite</hi> benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and goodneſs of his Nature. And this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
he hath ſtill, whereby we may encourage our
ſelves to go to him for ſpiritual Bleſſings, behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Creation filled with his <hi>common</hi> Bleſſings.</p>
               <p>As from the Afflictions and Temptations of
his Humane Nature, we may be encouraged to
go to him for ſuccour when we are tempted and
tryed. So from the <hi>infinite</hi> benignity of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature ſhining forth in his Creation, we may
be encouraged to ask the things that are neceſſary
for our Salvation. Hath he in his creating Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
provided <hi>food</hi> for every Creature, when it
was not asked, and will he not give thee <hi>bread</hi> for
thy Soul, when thou goeſt and askeſt him for it?
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64312:60"/>
Did his Goodneſs ſo freely flow out to his <hi>whole</hi>
Creation; and hath that Nature no goodneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in it to his own People, that are nearer
to him than any other Creature? And are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Parts of his Natural, but the Subjects of his
New-Creation; which, as it is Spiritual, is the
better part of it.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly; As all Things were made by
Chriſt, ſo alſo for him, as the Scripture in many
places aſſerts, <hi>Col. 1. 16. All
things were made by him and
far him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It was uſually ſaid by the Jews; <hi>All things were made for the Meſſias.</hi>
                  </note> Rev. 4. ult. <hi>Thou
haſt created all things, and for
thy pleaſure they are and were
created.</hi> The <hi>firſt Adam</hi> was ſet over the works
of God's Hand, but he ſinning againſt his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
it came into the hand of the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi>
and all things were put under his Feet. But this
fell out, not by chance or accident, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Counſel</hi> of God when the World was
made. And accordingly the management of
the <hi>Creation</hi> hath been in his hands from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning;
as it appears in the Records of the <hi>Old
Teſtament.</hi> And when he came into our Nature,
our <hi>Humanity</hi> was inveſted in this power with the
Divine Perſon of Chriſt, eſpecially at his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
and Aſcention into Heaven; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſpeaks as if it was then given him, <hi>Matth.</hi>
28. <hi>All power is given me both in Heaven and
Earth.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 17. Thou haſt given him
power over all fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now this was in the
<hi>Counſel</hi> of Heaven, and this was the end of this
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64312:61"/>
                  <hi>Worlds</hi> Creation, that being put under the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of Jeſus Chriſt it might be governed, and
all things managed therein to the higheſt exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Glory of God. For this Son of God,</p>
               <p>1. He brings forth the Knowledg of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Counſels of God concerning Man's Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
wherein he ſhews forth the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>the deep things of God.</hi> Wherein the infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Mercy, Love, Juſtice, and Holineſs of
God are manifeſted in the World, in the moſt
reſplendent edition of them. And for that end
he hath inſpired men by his Spirit in the ſeveral
Ages of the World, whereby this great <hi>Myſtery</hi>
might be made known to the Glory of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For though there have been <hi>Prophets</hi>
ſpeaking of it ever ſince the World began, <hi>Luk.</hi>
1. 70. yet it was by the Spirit of Chriſt that they
ſo ſpake, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
               <p>2. He hath alſo delivered to men the Rules of
<hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> and ſuch as conduce more
in the practice of them to the honour of God,
than what was performable in Man's Primitive
State; the Conditions of Life under the New-Covenant
being more to his Glory, than thoſe of
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ormer were.</p>
               <p>3. He hath in all Ages been gathering in ſome
of the Children of men into a ſtate of Salvation,
out of that loſt and ruined ſtate into which the
ſin of the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> had caſt them, acquainting
them with the Counſel of God for that end,
giving them his Spirit to enlighten their Minds,
and to ſanctifie their Hearts; and ſo forming
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64312:61"/>
them to the praiſe of God, and as Veſſels of
Mercy preparing them for his Glory. And this he
did before his Incarnation.</p>
               <p>4. In the fulneſs of time he came himſelf into
the <hi>fleſh</hi> of Man, and brought forth upon the
Stage of the World, that great Myſtery of the
Incarnation. When alſo he declared the infinite
Love, and the Counſels and Purpoſes of the
Heart of God more fully than had before been
made known, encountred and conquered the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Temptations of Satan and the World, and
then offered up that great Sacrifice of himſelf for
to make <hi>atonement</hi> for ſin, which had been ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
from the beginning of the World. And then
being buried, he roſe again, looſing the Bands of
Death and the Grave, and aſcended triumphant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into Heaven, and acquired a new Title to his
Dominion over the World in his <hi>conqueſt</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>5. And being now in Heaven, yet ſtill the
Creation is in his hand, and bringing in <hi>revenews</hi>
of Glory to God by him. He diſpoſeth of <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi>
and <hi>Nations</hi> as he pleaſeth; ſometimes
throwing down the <hi>mighty from their Seats, and
then exalting the lowly and meek,</hi> as was propheſied
of him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 70. Sometimes ſtraitning the
Nations in his <hi>diſpleaſure,</hi> and then enlarging
them again in his <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>goodneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He takes care for the upholding and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
the <hi>everlaſting Goſpel;</hi> accompanies it
with his Spirit to the <hi>converſion</hi> of Souls to God,
and building them up an <hi>habitation</hi> for him; fits
them for his Service and Praiſe in this World, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64312:62"/>
then gathers them into the preſence of his Father
to ſtand before him, and to <hi>miniſter</hi> to him for
ever. He alſo orders their Tryals and Sufferings
as he ſeeth them requiſite to the Glory of God,
and their <hi>preparation</hi> for Heaven; and then when
he ſeeth it meet, delivers them out of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</p>
               <p>6. After all this, at the time of the <hi>Conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of all things, he will come down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and judge the World, receiving ſome into
the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of his Father, and ſending others
into everlaſting Fire, wherein the riches of God's
<hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> and the clearneſs of his Juſtice
will moſt <hi>illuſtriouſly</hi> ſhine forth, to his eternal
Praiſe and Glory.</p>
               <p>And when this is done, he delivers up his
Kingdom and Dominion to his Father that he had
received from him; having ſubdued all Enemies
<hi>under his feet,</hi> and put down all
<hi>Rule,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Authority,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> his
Father becomes <hi>All in All.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus with reſpect to Chriſt, and to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
of theſe Glorious Works, (which
I have but briefly touched) was this Creation of
the World erected; and which are <hi>tranſcendently</hi>
more to the glory of God than what could have
been under the <hi>firſt Adam,</hi> either by any obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
performed by him, or the diſpenſation of

                  <p>That the <hi>Redemption</hi> of the World is a greater
Work than the <hi>Creation</hi> of it, ſeeing it was erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the Son of God to tranſact that glorious

all thoſe means that are made uſe of in a ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency

                  <p>This <hi>lower World</hi> was made with reſpect to it,

                  <p>And if the Angels, that are the chief part of

that it might be ſet under the <hi>government</hi> of the

Thou haſt made him a little lower than the Angels;

And the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> had reſpect, not ſo much to the

                  <p>We may hence conclude, That the whole Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
being made for Chriſt, and put into his

of the Glory of God. However the courſe of

at laſt meer in this general Iſſue, the <hi>univerſal</hi> end
of all things, which is the Glory of God. The
<hi>firſt Adam</hi> was made and placed upon the <hi>Stage</hi>
of the World, that through him God might have
the Glory of his Creation; but he being muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
fell from his Station, loſt his Strength, and
ſo could not ſerve the end of his <hi>Being.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God hath now put all things into a <hi>ſurer</hi>

For he that is both God and Man, is
likely to bring in both higher and ſurer glory to
God than he that was but <hi>meer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Man. If he

all things; or, becauſe he wants love and good
will to God, which cannot be neither, becauſe
he is his only begotten Son.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing the Work of Man's Redemption
and Salvation was principally in the eye of God
when he made the World, as that Work wherein

of God reſulting thence; I next proceed to
ſhew wherein this Knowledg is deficient, and falls
ſhort of that which we have by <hi>Divine Revelation</hi>
in the Word of God.</p>
               <p>1. In General. The Myſtery of Man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
by Chriſt, is not made known by the
Works of Creation. All that the Apoſtle ſaith
in my Text was known concerning God by it, is,
his Eternal Power and Godhead. It would not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64312:65"/>
have been a Myſtery hid in God for ſo many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
if the Works of Nature had declared it to
men. <hi>Adam</hi> might ſee God as a <hi>Creator,</hi> but not
as a <hi>Redeemer</hi> in theſe Works of Nature. He
might ſee an infinite Power, Wiſdom, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſhining forth herein. But that Second and
better Edition of theſe Attributes to be ſet forth
in the work of Redemption, he could not ſee.
For though God made the World, in order to
the Work of <hi>Redemption,</hi> as I ſhewed before, yet
he did not make it as a <hi>Redeemer.</hi> And therefore
it hath nothing directly written concerning Chriſt
upon it. The Tree of Life, Paradiſe, the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Eve</hi> out of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſide, and then joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them together in Marriage; yea, the making
<hi>Adam</hi> himſelf, and the dominion God gave him
over the Creatures, and conſtituting him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Perſon, are applicable to Chriſt and the
Church, and are figuratively ſo applyed; but
yet it cannot well be imagined that <hi>Adam</hi> could
read any thing of Chriſt, or the Work of our
Redemption herein. There was no need of
God's revealing any thing concerning the Worlds
<hi>Redemption</hi> until Man's ſin and fall. Therefore
after the Fall God revealed it to <hi>Adam.</hi> And
the firſt intimation of it was, of <hi>the Seed of the
Woman breaking the head of the Serpent;</hi> and there
was nothing in Nature could have declared ſo
much as this. And the farther diſcovery of it to
the World, was by <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> or <hi>Viſions,</hi> or by
an <hi>audible</hi> Voice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God needed not have
ſent forth <hi>Prophets,</hi> and Chriſt <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to have
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64312:65"/>
preached this Myſtery to the World, if the Works
of Creation could have declared it. It's true,
it's ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 1. of the Heavens, and the
Firmament, the courſe of Night and Day, that
they preach to the World. <hi>Their Line is gone
forth into all the Earth, and their Words to the
end of the World.</hi> Which words are applyed to
the Apoſtles Miniſtry, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. But yet they
are not ſuch Preachers as the Apoſtles; for they
tell the World of a Knowledg, which the greateſt
Searchers of Nature were ignorant of. A My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
that was <hi>hid</hi> in God, and in former Ages,
not made known to Men, no nor to Angels nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that can read what is written in Nature bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than Man. And <hi>Athens</hi> was a ſtranger to it,
when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> came thither, as you read
<hi>Acts</hi> 17. There was the Seminary of Humane
Literature, there he met with Learned <hi>Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and <hi>Stoicks,</hi> &amp;c. but he found nothing of
the Knowledg of Chriſt there.</p>
               <p>Well then, where is the Wiſe? Where is the
Scribe? Where is the Diſputer of this World?
As the Apoſtle ſpeaks in a way of holy <hi>deriſion,</hi> or
of <hi>triumph</hi> rather, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. Where is <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
and <hi>Plato?</hi> Where is <hi>Xenophon</hi> and <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle?</hi>
Where is <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Cato?</hi> Where is <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes</hi>
and <hi>Cicero?</hi> How is all their Wiſdom
bafled and non-pluſt by the fooliſhneſs of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
wherein the way to Man's true Felicity,
which they ſo <hi>anxiouſly</hi> ſought after, is declared
to be by a <hi>Crucified Chriſt.</hi>

may dictate this to be his Duty, yet coming to
God by the <hi>Mediator,</hi> the Man Chriſt Jeſus, is
above the reach of this Light. Here we muſt
have recourſe to Scripture-Revelation, that tells
us that <hi>Chriſt is the Way, the Truth, and the Life;
and no Man cometh to the Father but by Him,</hi> John
14. <hi>And there is one Mediatour between God and
Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5. As a

as it was preſented to <hi>Jacob.</hi> And the Name
<hi>Immanuel</hi> is not found written any where in the
Book of Nature; who is the way whereby God
is with Men, and they with Him. For want of

But this Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt they were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ignorant of. God hath written nothing of
this in the Works of Nature. Though the Light
of Nature could inſtruct them in the neceſſity, or
at leaſt the expediency of going to God by ſome
Mediator or other, and therefore they invented
ſuch to themſelves; yet that the Son of God, in
the Nature of Man, ſhould be the Perſon by
whom to go to God, they knew nothing of.</p>
               <p>3. If we ſpeak of Man's <hi>Reconciliation</hi> to God.
Though the Light of Nature declares to Man, it
is his great <hi>happineſs</hi> to have the favour of God,
and to have that ſin pardoned to him, which his
natural Conſcience doth condemn him for; yet
how to obtain this Pardon and Reconciliation is
only made known to us by the direction of the
Scriptures. It's true, the Heathens made uſe of
<hi>Sacrifices</hi> of ſeveral ſorts, as <hi>Bullocks, Lambs,
Sheep, Goats, Swine;</hi> and in ſome caſes, <hi>Men</hi>
and <hi>Children,</hi> as their own Poets, <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
&amp;c. and ſo <hi>Plutarch</hi> and others of their
Moral Writers affirm; and theſe they offered up
to appeaſe their gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when any Calamities fell
upon them.</p>

307. They offered <hi>Placatory Sacrifices</hi> to ſuch
gods of whom they feared harm, and <hi>Propitiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
to ſuch of whom they expected good, as Dr.
<hi>Jackſon</hi> Obſerves. But theſe they uſed not with
any reſpect to Chriſt, who was the end of the
Inſtitution of all the <hi>Expiatory</hi> or <hi>Propitiatory
Sacrifices,</hi> and gave them their Vertue and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,
and ſo they could not avail them to what
they deſigned; as the very uſe of them they bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
either from the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Noah,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed
in the notice of it down to his <hi>Poſterity,</hi>
or from ſome acquaintance they might have with
the Jewiſh Laws, rather than from any Dictates
of Natural Light, howſoever improved by them.
For what-ever may be ſaid concerning Sacrifices,
called <hi>Gratulatory,</hi> offered by way of Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
that a principle of Natural Gratitude
might lead them to their uſe; by giving part of
the whole, to acknowledg the whole from God;
yet who can imagine it concerning <hi>Expiatory</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
that ever the Light of Nature could lead
them, to think that the ſlaying of a Bruit Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as a Sheep, or a Lamb, or a Goat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:64312:67"/>
ſhould be able to reconcile God to Man, or be a
meet Satisfaction to the offended Deity for his
ſin, or indeed be pleaſing to God at all. And
though this was the practice of the Jews, yet
they were led to it by God's <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> and not
by the Light of Nature. And though ſome have
ſaid, that the continuance of <hi>Nature</hi> in its courſe,
and the benefits that are thereby daily conveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from God to the World, do declare to all
Men, that he is ſome-way reconciled, elſe Man's
ſin would either have <hi>diſſolved,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted</hi>
this beneficial courſe of Nature; yet this
cannot lead Man to the true <hi>Propitiatory,</hi> nor to
the way of enjoying the benefit thereof. By
theſe common benefits of Nature, God <hi>left not
himſelf without witneſs to the Gentiles;</hi> and for
which they ought to have been thankful; but by
theſe they could not underſtand that they had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
with God, were not under God's diſpleaſure
for their ſin, ſeeing the worſt of men partaked of
them as well as others, and the Beaſts as well as
Men. It's true, ſomething may hence be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the <hi>benignity</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> of the Nature of
God, his long-ſuffering and patience, whereby
they might be encouraged to go to him for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Pardon; but the way wherein God hath
appointed to beſtow this pardoning Mercy, they
could not know by any natural Light. And what
reſpect God may have to ſome among the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
that beſt improved that Light, and had recourſe
to his general Mercy, without the diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64312:68"/>
of a Saviour, which they had not means to
attain, I ſhall rather leave it amongſt the <hi>Secrets</hi>
of God's Counſel, than make determination
therein.</p>
               <p>But we that have the Scriptures, know that all
Man's Reconciliation is by the death of the <hi>Son</hi>
of God. And that pardon of ſin is by Faith in
his Blood, which things the Light of Nature is a
meer ſtranger too.</p>
               <p>3. As to the true knowledg of ſin, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
give a more diſtinct account than any that
can be known by Nature. Some <hi>groſſer</hi> ſins
may be known by it, but the ſecret <hi>Obliquities</hi> of
the Heart and Life are not detected but by a
ſtraiter Rule than the Light or Law of Nature.
The Apoſtle, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 7.) profeſſeth he had not
known Luſt to be ſin, except the Law of God
had ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet.</hi> It is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>David</hi> ſaith is <hi>exceeding
broad,</hi> can only diſcover ſin in the full latitude of
it. And which made the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>By the Law
is the knowledg of ſin.</hi> And therefore the Law
was firſt briefly publiſhed upon <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> and
afterwards explained and urged upon the People
by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as appears in the Book of <hi>Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
that they might, being under the conviction
of ſin, look towards the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> for Salvation,
who was yet to come, which needed not have
been, could the Law of Nature have given a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Knowledg and Conviction. Of it the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
reſolve that great Queſtion, <hi>unde malum?</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:64312:68"/>
diſcourſing of it in the firſt original of it; as
alſo in the due merit of it, and the puniſhment
it leadeth to.</p>
               <p>As for ſins that are more ſtrictly Evangelical,
as Unbelief in Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth not diſcover the Goſpel, ſo neither can
it do ſins againſt it. For this, we muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to the Word of Chriſt, and to his Spirit.
Whom he promiſed to ſend to convince the <hi>World</hi>
of ſin, <hi>becauſe they believed not on him;</hi> for the
Light of Nature could not evidence it to be
ſin.</p>
               <p>4. If we ſpeak alſo of the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of the
Soul in poſſeſſing the <hi>chief</hi> Good; Here alſo
Scripture-Light excels that of Nature. There
was nothing did more exerciſe the Minds of the
wiſer Heathens than this; to find out and enjoy
this Good; and nothing were they more divided
in their Judgments about. But the Reaſon was,
becauſe they wanted the true knowledg of God,
and knew not the way to the <hi>fruition</hi> of him,
who alone is this <hi>chief Good of Man.</hi> But here
the Scriptures again ſupply the defect of Nature's
Light; which reveal to us, not only that God is,
and what he is, but that Everlaſting Covenant of
his Grace made in Jeſus Chriſt, wherein, and
whereby he offers himſelf to Men to become
their God, and to take them for his People. And
there we find this <hi>ſummum Bonum.</hi> this chief good</p>
               <p>The Philoſophers of old, Yea, all Men are as
Merchants ſeeking this <hi>godly Pearl,</hi> but they find
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64312:69"/>
it not until they are by Scripture-Light led to it.
And we may ſay of it as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Wiſdom;</hi>
The <hi>Depth</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is not in me;</hi> and <hi>the Sea ſaith,
It is not with me: It cannot be gotten for Gold,
neither ſhall Silver be weighed for the price thereof,</hi>
&amp;c. (and therefore is not found in Silver or
Gold); <hi>Deſtruction and Death ſay, We have heard
the ſame thereof with our Ears.</hi> Thoſe that are in
the Grave, or Hell, may have heard of it; but
where there is no Good, there cannot be found
this chief Good. But the Word of God tells
the Living of it, ſhews it to them, and invites
them to the poſſeſſing of it.</p>
               <p>5. With reſpect to the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of God. The
Light of Nature doth dictate that God ought to
be worſhipt; but Scripture-Revelation is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to guide us unto the right way of Worſhip.
I know there is <hi>Natural Worſhip</hi> founded upon
the Right of Creation, which is known by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's
Light; but then there is other Worſhip
that is <hi>Inſtituted,</hi> with reſpect to the Work of
Redemption, which is made known only by the
Scriptures of the Old and New <hi>Teſtament;</hi> as
<hi>Plato</hi> once ſaid, <hi>The Maker of this univerſe, as it
is hard to find out, ſo as hard to find out the right
way of worſhipping him.</hi> Whereupon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. ſpeaks of the Gentiles, <hi>That they
became vain in their Imaginations,</hi> inventing to
themſelves wayes of Worſhip, ſome whereof
were ridiculous, others obſcene, and all diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to the Greatneſs and Holineſs of the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64312:69"/>
Supream Deity. As the late Author of the Book
called <hi>Moral Vertue and Grace,</hi> quòtes a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Paſſage out of <hi>Jamblichus;</hi> which, by his
leave, I ſhall here tranſcribe in the Engliſh of it;
<hi>It is not eaſie to know what God will be pleaſed with,
unleſs we be either immediately inſtructed by God our
ſelves, or taught by ſome Perſon whom God hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed
with, or arrived to it by ſome Divine Means
or other.</hi> And therefore the Worſhip the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
performed to their gods, how ridiculous
ſoever, they pretended to receive it, either <hi>Affla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu
Numinis,</hi> by ſome kind of Inſpiration, or from
their Oracles, or ſome other way of Revelation.
And we know what the <hi>Mahometan Religion</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to in this caſe. But becauſe they were
ſtrangers to the <hi>Authentick</hi> Revelation of the true
God in the Word of Truth, therefore they ſo
<hi>groſly</hi> erred in the Way and Rule of their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>6. Or, if we ſpeak of <hi>tranquillity</hi> of Mind,
under all the Calamities that attend Man's Life.
This the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> of old induſtriouſly ſought
after as a chief part of Man's Happineſs, and
propoſed ſeveral wayes to attain it. Some, by
looking upon all things as coming by an inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Fate,</hi> and an invincible connection of ſecond
Cauſes. Others of them relieved themſelves by
looking upon theſe Evils as ſuch as are common
to Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they muſt be content to bear the
common lot of all Man-kind. <hi>Nihil humanum a

That they were ſent to be the Tryals of Vertue,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64312:70"/>
and in patient bearing them, men diſcovered true
greatneſs of Mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But, alas, the <hi>Bed</hi> they
made was too ſhort for the Soul to repoſe it ſelf
upon. But the <hi>Scriptures</hi> ſhew the true way of
it. 1. By ſhewing all theſe evils, as diſpenced
by the <hi>Sovereign</hi> Hand of the onely Wiſe God.
2. That they are the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of God for the
good of his Family. 3. This alſo ſets before us
the great Example of Chriſt in patient ſuffering.
4. As alſo an <hi>everlaſting Reſt</hi> in the World to
come, aſſured by the Promiſes of God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into by Chriſt as a <hi>fore-runner,</hi> having firſt
purchaſed it by his Blood; the true hope where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
is the great relief the Saints have under all
their preſent troubles; and many ſuch like. Which
being truly apprehended, will bring in that true
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or tranquillity of Mind which all <hi>Philoſophy</hi>
cannot reach. A Principle of Faith being able
to do more for us in this kind than any principle
of Reaſon. Thoſe few words of the Apoſtle,
recorded 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 17, 18. Our light affliction,
which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far
more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while
we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the
things which are not ſeen,</hi> &amp;c. is more than can be
found in all the Volums of Natural or Moral Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
to quiet and comfort the Soul of Man
under all the Calamities of Life.</p>
               <p>7. As to Conformity to God. The Light of
Nature taught <hi>Plato,</hi> and ſome of the wiſer <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
to ſay, That Man's Happineſs did conſiſt in
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64312:70"/>
his likeneſs to God; but the way of growing up
into this Likeneſs they did not underſtand. For
to this is requiſite the <hi>mortification</hi> of fleſhly Luſts,
which the Precepts of their ſtricteſt <hi>Philoſophers</hi>
could not effect. Some things they might do to
the ſubduing of the Paſſions to the Dominion of
Reaſon, and thereby introduce ſome moral tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
into the Soul of Man. But the <hi>radical</hi>
Corruptions of Man's Nature, which eſpecially
are Self-exaltation and Self-ſufficiency they rather
did cheriſh than extirpate. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> ſeem to
proceed fartheſt towards this ſubduing of Nature,
upon the Fundamental <hi>Principle</hi> of their Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
That Man's Happineſs lay in things that
were in his own Power, as in maintaining a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<hi>ſerenity</hi> and <hi>evenneſs</hi> of Soul in all the <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences</hi>
of Life, and not in the
things of <hi>Fortune,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vid. Epict. Enchirid.</note> which were out of
his Power; but it reached rather to
thoſe Paſſions that they perceived
did diſquiet Nature, than to thoſe other evils
that are pleaſing to it.</p>
               <p>But to this Conformity is alſo requiſite the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
of a New and <hi>Divine Nature;</hi> Now it
is not any natural Knowledg of God can effect
this. The Apoſtle tells us, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. That
Believers are <hi>made Partakers of the Divine Nature;</hi>
but it is through <hi>the knowledg of Chriſt calling them
to Glory and Vertue, and through the great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
promiſes given us in him.</hi> Hereupon alſo we
read, <hi>That Chriſt is made to us ſanctification,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64312:71"/>
1 <hi>Cor. 1. 30. And whoever is in Chriſt is a New
Creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. Which is all one as to
partake of the <hi>Divine Nature.</hi> So that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to God reſults from partaking his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
this we cannot have without <hi>communion</hi>
with him; this Communion we cannot have but
in Chriſt; and Chriſt is not made known but by
Scripture-Revelation. So that Nature cannot
make a Chriſtian; as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Apol. cap.</hi>
18. <hi>Fiunt, non naſcuntur Chriſtiani;</hi> Chriſtians are
made ſo, not born ſo. And therefore that ſo
noted Saying of the ſame Author, in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Chapter, that ſeems to contradict this; <hi>O Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonium
Animae naturaliter Chriſtianae!</hi> is to be
rightly underſtood in the ſenſe he ſpeaks it. For
ſpeaking againſt the vanity of the Heathen, in
making many <hi>gods</hi> to themſelves, he appeals to a
practice that even Nature did lead them to, which
was to lift up their eyes to Heaven, and to ſay,
<hi>Deus dedit,</hi> God gave me this or that; and <hi>Deus
videt,</hi> God ſeeth. Whereby the Soul did, as it
were, naturally own but one God, as the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
do. Whereupon he breaks out into that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Speech, <hi>O the teſtimony of the Soul naturally
Chriſtian!</hi> But to make us Chriſtians, in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
the Nature of Chriſt, and conformity to
God; this is above the reach of Nature. Though
the Heavens <hi>declare God's Glory, day and night ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſpeech;</hi> and the Sun comes forth <hi>as a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
out of his Chamber</hi> every morning, <hi>&amp;c. and
nothing is hid from the heat of it;</hi> yet it is the <hi>Law</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:64312:71"/>
of God that <hi>converts the Soul, enlightens the
Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo brings Man into conformity to
God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>8. Or if we ſpeak of the Immortality of the
Soul, the Reſurrection of the Body, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the World, the future Rewards of Men in
the World to come, theſe are all made evident to
us by <hi>Scripture-Light,</hi> which were either not at
all, or but darkly known by any <hi>Light</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
How dubiouſly, and ſometimes ridiculou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly
did the <hi>ſageſt</hi> of the Heathen write of theſe
things. As to the Souls Immortality, their great
Orator <hi>Cicero</hi> doubted of it. As
for the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the Dead,<note place="margin">Plin. lib. 7. cap. 55.</note>
their great Naturaliſt <hi>Pliny</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plodes
it. As to Rewards and
Puniſhments in a future State, their Poets had ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
Fictions about them. Therefore <hi>Life
and Immortality are ſaid to be brought to Light by
the Goſpel,</hi> ſpeaking more diſtinctly of the future
State, and World to come, than what is found
either in the Dictates of Nature, or the Writings
of the Old-Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Laſtly; Yea, as to the very Nature of God,
his Holineſs, Unity, Simplicity, Actuality of
Being, Omniſcience, Immenſity, and other At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes;
theſe are more clearly revealed in the
Word of God, than in any Evidence of Nature.
Which though in this it is not wholly dark, as in
ſome other Truths before mentioned, yet even
here it is not ſo diſtinct and clear as the Scripture
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64312:72"/>
is; which as it is a <hi>Syſtem</hi> of Natural Truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
any other Writing in the World; ſo it
contains thoſe <hi>Supernatural Truths</hi> that could not
elſe be known to the Sons of Men.</p>
               <p>And this is all I ſhall ſpeak to this Head; which
though it doth not ſo immediately reſult from my
preſent Subject, yet I thought needful to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;

                  <p>It argues alſo our great <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> that this
great Mercy of God in the Scriptures ſhould be
no more valued by us. Do we pitty the poor

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:64312:72"/>
God dealt with us in ſuch Mercy as with <hi>Iſrael</hi> of

he hath not ſo dealt with every Nation, and ſhall
not we be thankful above other People? Hath
God magnified his Word above
all his Name;<note place="margin">Pſal. 138. 2.</note> and ſhall we put it

or hath God magnified his Name <hi>upon his Word,</hi> as
a learned <hi>Rabbin</hi> reads the <hi>Text;</hi> and ſhall we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe

                  <p>The great Maſters of Wiſdom among the

from ſome Fragments of thoſe Truths that were

And then concludes the Pſalm. <hi>Praiſe ye the

God's Being.</head>
               <p>I Shall now proceed to ſpeak to a further
evidence of God's Being from one ſpecial
part of his Creation, which is the Creation
of man. And therefore ſhall ſpeak to it by
it ſelf. And we may obſerve ſome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
things related about it above what is ſaid
of the other works of God.</p>
               <p>1. When God in the courſe of his works
came to give Man his <hi>Being,</hi> He ſaid <hi>Come
let us make Man.</hi> Of his other Works he
only ſaid <hi>let them be,</hi> as, <hi>Let there be Light,</hi> and
<hi>Let there be a Firmament</hi> &amp;c. But as if him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was more Concerned, and that in the
<hi>Trinity</hi> of his Being, about making Man then
any other of his works, he ſaith <hi>let us make
Man.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:64312:74"/>
2. Other creatures he ſpeaks to the Earth
and Waters to bring them forth, whether <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables;</hi>
as Herbs, Graſs, Fruits, Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Or <hi>Animals</hi> in the ſeveral <hi>Regions</hi> of Ayr,
Earth, or Water where they do Inhabit,
But God ſets to his own hand in the making
of Man, He himſelf forms him <hi>of the duſt of
the ground,</hi> and then himſelf <hi>breathed into
him the breath of life,</hi> Gen. 2. 7.</p>
               <p>3. God ſaith alſo of Man, <hi>Let us make Man,
after our own Image, and our own likeneſs.</hi> Gen.
1. 26. Which he ſaid not of his other works,
either the Light or Firmament, or Sun, Moon,
or Stars, which are all Glorious Creatures;
Yet he ſaid of none of theſe, <hi>Let us make
them after our own likeneſs.</hi> It may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
alſo that the Word <hi>Created</hi> is three
times repeated, and that in one Verſe, with
reſpect to Man's Creation. <hi>So God Created Man
in his own Image, in the Image of God Created
he him, Male and Female Created he them.</hi>
Gen. 1. 27. Which ſome concieve refers to
the plural term uſed about the making
of Man. <hi>Let us make Man.</hi> God Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him, that is God the <hi>Father;</hi> God Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him, that is God the <hi>Son;</hi> God Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him that is God the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And
which is remarkable, when God is called in
Scripture the Maker or Creator of Man it is
ſtill expreſſed Plurally, as 35 <hi>Job</hi> 10. and
149 <hi>Pſal. 2. 12 Eccles. 1. 54 Iſa.</hi> 5. Where
God is ſtiled the <hi>Creatours,</hi> and <hi>Makers</hi> of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:64312:74"/>
Man in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text. Yet the Creation
of him was but one; and the God that Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
him one alſo.</p>
               <p>4. Man had this <hi>Preeminence</hi> alſo that he
was Created laſt. God proceeding from the
more imperfect to the more perfect Works.
Making Man laſt, ſhews he is the moſt perfect
part of his Creation. And God ſhewed this
reſpect to him alſo herein, that he would not
make him, till he had Built and richly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht
the World, to be a fit habitation for
him. And it is Evident that God had Man
in his eye when he was erecting, framing, and
furniſhing of it, for it is exactly fitted to the
nature, neceſſity, and delight of Man: as he
had Chriſt in his eye when he made Man.
And indeed when God had finiſht the reſt
of his Creation, he did Epitomize it all in
Man; for in his conſtitution, we have Mortal,
and Immortal, Viſible and Inviſible, Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
and Incorporeal, Material and Immaterial,
the Superior and Inferior World joyn'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the making of one perſon. So that
man is <hi>utriuſque mundi nexus,</hi> as <hi>Scaliger</hi>
ſpeaks. And there is not ſuch a creature as
Man upon this account in the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Whereupon <hi>David</hi> that knew well
his curious frame, ſpeaks largely of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip
of God herein, <hi>Pſal. 139. v. 13. 14,
15. 16. verſes. Thou haſt poſſeſſed my Reins,
thou haſt covered me in my Mothers Womb.
I will praiſe thee for I am fearfully and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:64312:75"/>
made, Marvelous are thy Works, and
that my Soul knoweth right well. My Subſtance
was not hid from thee when I was made in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
and curiouſly wrought in the loweſt parts of
the Earth.</hi> So that God having impreſt ſo
much of his own <hi>Likeneſs,</hi> and beſtowed ſuch
peculiar <hi>Workmanſhip</hi> upon Man, he hath laid
a foundation for ſtrong <hi>Arguments</hi> to evince
his Being to us therefrom.</p>
               <p>If we look upon his body; How curiouſly
and rationally are the ſeveral Organs, Veſſels,
and Members thereof fitted to their ſeveral <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
in nature, and each of them contributing
in their ſeveral offices to one general End,
which is the life of Man. How do the <hi>Veins</hi>
and <hi>Arteries</hi> meet about the heart; Nature
ſending ſuccour from all parts to it, as being
the chief Seat of life. And again the heart
doth by them convey <hi>Blood</hi> and Spirits to the
whole Body, it being the chief Fountain of
life. And to give but one inſtance more in
that which ſeems to be the moſt contemptible
part of the Body, which is the humours of it.
In theſe we may take notice of a Divine
Wiſdom. Choler that is hot, and of a fiery
quality is uſeful to quicken the body, and to
ſtirr up Nature to 'its proper Functions, and
by 'its heat to prevent the coagulation and
corruption of the blood. And the <hi>Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
humour being thick and groſs is uſeful to
retain the natural and Vital Spirits that they
may not be too <hi>Volatile</hi> and evaporate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:64312:75"/>
And the <hi>Phlegmatick</hi> humour, which is more
watery, cool, and moiſt, is of uſe to cool and
attenuate the blood, and ſo make it fitter for
Motion. Now if the Wiſdom of the Creator
appears in theſe meaneſt things, which are as it
were the Excrements of Nature, how much
more in the noble parts of the Body: But I muſt
not, nay I cannot ſpeak of theſe things as an
<hi>Anatomiſt</hi> or <hi>Phyſician.</hi> But we may behold this
frame, and admiring ſay, <hi>Oh how exquiſitly are the
Eyes turned, the Ears, and Noſtrils bored, the
Fingers branched, the Joynts coupled, the Nerves
extended, the Veins diffuſed, the Bones firmed
and faſtned.</hi> I remember what I have long
ſince read, in the <hi>Poet,</hi> concerning the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Parts of Man's body.</p>

               <p>And ſo he proceeds. And in the leaſt part
of man ſomething may bee ſeen of God. In

and ſo an <hi>Atheist,</hi> upon the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the curious Structure of Man's Body, could
not forbear the giving an Hymn of Praiſe to
the wiſe Creator and framer of it. And it is
ſo every way perfect that if a Man had an
<hi>hundred</hi> years given him, as it is ſaid of one,
to find out ſome defect in it he would not be
able to do it. As among the Heathens they
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64312:76"/>
had a God calld <hi>Momus</hi> who made it his work
to Carp at the works of the other Gods. But
let a Man ſtudy to find out ſomething to Carp
at in this <hi>exquiſite</hi> frame, he ſhall be able ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to find nothing. Many indeed will pretend
there are <hi>Errata's</hi> in the Works of Providence
which they could correct, but it is becauſe they
underſtand them not. But what <hi>Errata's</hi> can
they find in the Works of Creation, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
this of the body of Man? This is
one of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that my Text mentions, of
the things that God made wherein we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hld
his <hi>Eternal power and Godhead.</hi> And if a
Man would play the part of <hi>Zoilus,</hi> to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
this <hi>Poem,</hi> as he did <hi>Homers,</hi> he would
but ſhew himſelf Ignorant and Impious at once.
So that Man need not go far to fetch an <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
for the <hi>Being</hi> of God, he carries an <hi>Evident</hi>
one continually about him in his own body;
Eſpecially if man did but know himſelf in this
his meaner part. Did he but know the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
frame of the eye, and the ſeveral <hi>Tunicles</hi>
and <hi>Humours</hi> belonging to it, whereby it is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for ſeeing: And did he then but know
how the eye doth ſee; How the raies that
come from one point in the Object do meet in
one point in the bottom of the Eye. Did he
alſo know the various <hi>Workmanſhip</hi> of the Ear,
and underſtand how an Articulate voice
ſhould paſs through the fluid <hi>medium</hi> of the
Air, and enter the Ear <hi>Articulated</hi> as it comes
from the mouth of the ſpeaker.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:64312:76"/>
To give but one Inſtance more, in that
work of Nature which is proper to Man, and
that is, Speech. It is wonderful to conſider
how a little <hi>breath</hi> ſhould be modulated into ſo
many diſtinct ſyllabical ſounds, by the nimble
touches of the Tongue in the ſeveral parts of
the Mouth, and by other inſtruments of Speech.
But theſe common works of Nature, we won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not at; partly becauſe they are common,
and partly becauſe ſo little underſtood: yet
if duly conſidered, they carry in them a clear
evidence of the Being of God.</p>
               <p>But to paſs to the more ſublime part of Man,
which is his Soul, which doth ſo much the
more clearly demonſtrate God's Being to us, by
how much he hath ſtampt more of his own
likeneſs upon it. And,</p>
               <p>1. We may argue from the Capacity of the
Soul, which manifeſtly extends beyond the
things of this World: And is capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
a greater good then any of this Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in regard that no finite good doth ſatisfie
it. Now if it be capable of a greater good,
ſurely there is ſuch a good, for there is no
<hi>Capacity</hi> in Nature in vain:
As there is no <hi>Vacuity</hi> in
Nature;<note place="margin">Quaelibet potentia appetit objectum ſibi Conveniens. <hi>Aquin. 3. p. q. 78. Art.</hi> 1. Appetitus &amp;. appetitum ſunt ut locum &amp; locatum. <hi>Fotherb. Atheom. p.</hi> 196.</note> every place is fil'd
with ſomething. So if there
was any natural Capacity in
the creatures, and no object
to Anſwer to it, there would be a kind of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity
in the Creation: Thoſe infinite and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64312:77"/>
deſires of the Soul, ſhew that there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
object to ſatisfie them. And therefore of
all the faculties of the Soul, that which the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or the <hi>Appetite</hi> of the
Soul, doth beſt repreſent infinity, becauſe it is
infinite in its Inclinations, though not in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And as it beſt doth repreſent Infinity, ſo
it doth demonſtrate alſo that ſomewhere it is
to be found. Now it is <hi>Evident</hi> it is not found
in the <hi>Creature,</hi> and therefore it is in God.</p>
               <p>And as it had been (to ſpeak with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence)
ſome deficiency in Gods Creation, not
to have made a Creature capable of knowing
and enjoying the Creator: So there being a
Creature in the Univerſe of ſuch a Capacity,
it ſhews that there is ſuch an Object for
which this Capacity is given.</p>
               <p>2. It is evident that the Soul hath within
it divine inclinations, or, an <hi>Idea</hi> of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as one ſpeaks, and aſpiring to higher
things then thoſe that are Earthly and ſenſual,
even towards Divinity, and therefore there is
a Divinity, As the Philoſopher ſaid, <hi>Hoc ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
anima argumentum divinitatis quod eam di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina
delectent.</hi> The Soul hath this Argument
in its ſelf, that it is of a Divine Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Divine things are delightful to it: So it
ſhews there are Divine Beings, (or rather a
<hi>Divine Being</hi>) becauſe the Soul hath incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
towards a Divinity: And as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
once ſaid, as I have ſomewhere read of him,
<hi>Though it be but little we know of Superiour
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64312:77"/>
Beings, yet that little doth more delight us,
then all that we know of things here below.</hi> I
know that men given up to a <hi>ſenſual</hi> life, little
concern themſelves about higher things then
of this <hi>lower</hi> World; But we are not to take
the <hi>meaſure</hi> of the Soul from ſuch that ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe
it, but rather from them in whom it hath
had its beſt improvements. And though it is a
true ſaying, <hi>Semen naturae non aſſurgit in fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum
gratiae;</hi> The Seed of Nature cannot riſe
up into the Fruit of Grace; yet in ſome it hath
riſen up to a greater <hi>heigth</hi> then in others, in
whom we may take the beſt <hi>meaſures</hi> of it:
As Chriſt our Saviour ſaid to the man menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in the Goſpel, <hi>Thou art not far from the
Kingdom of God:</hi> Of thoſe that are out of the
Kingdom of God, yet ſome come nearer to it
then others, that have made better improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of natural helps, and in whom we may
take the beſt meaſure of the principles of
Nature.</p>
               <p>3. Whence is it that the Soul brings an
Impreſſion of a Deity upon it into the World?
Even thoſe people that have not had the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of any <hi>Inſtitution</hi> in Knowledge, yet have
all acknowledg'd a Deity, which ſhews they
had this from Nature, and not from Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
So that in this ſence, that
ſaying of <hi>Theodoret</hi> is true,<note place="margin">Theodoret lib. de An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelis, <hi>Tom. 2. p.</hi> 498.</note>
                  <hi>Divinity is first taught men by
Nature, and then it is rectified and confirmed
to men by Scripture.</hi> And this Man's Nature
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64312:78"/>
hath peculiar to it, that this Impreſſion is not
found in any Creature of this lower World,
but here alone; becauſe Man was made for
an higher end then the Brutes. And if there
was no God, this <hi>Impreſſion</hi> would be in vain,
which yet of all others is moſt <hi>generally</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven;<note place="margin">Si enim anima divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, aut à Deo data est, ſinc dubio datorem ſuum novit. <hi>Tertul. Teſtimon. animae. p.</hi> 88.</note> Yea, Man would be
herein more miſerable then the
Brutes, to have the fear of a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
upon his Soul, when there
is no ſuch object of his fear.</p>
               <p>The greateſt <hi>Travellers</hi> have not been able
to out-travel this notion of a Deity in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt
Countries whither they have come:
As is evident in that account given by the
greateſt Travellers, as <hi>Drake, Candiſh, Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luit,</hi>
&amp;c. One of them tells us that the firſt
thing he found amongſt the Salvage people in
<hi>No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>a Albion,</hi> when he arrived there, was that
he found them buſied about Off'ring a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
and when he had beſtowed ſome gifts of
his liberality upon them, they would have
Sacrific'd to him and his Company as Gods.
And to this I may add what I find in Scripture,
<hi>Paſs over the Iſles of</hi> Chittim <hi>and ſee, and ſend
to</hi> Kedar <hi>and conſider, hath a Nation changed
their Gods that were no Gods?</hi> Jer. 2. 10. And
the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> to the ſame purpoſe,
chap. 4. v. 5. <hi>All people will walk every one in
the Name of his God.</hi> All people, not only
the more civil, which ſome think, are meant
by the <hi>Iſles of Chittim,</hi> but the more barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:64312:78"/>
and undiſciplin'd, as the <hi>Kedarens:</hi> They
will none of them change their Gods, but will
walk in their Name. So that though the
Heathen did differ about the Number, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Nature, and Power of their Gods, yet
all had ſome Deity they worſhipt; And the
wiſer of them did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
one ſupreme Deity;<note place="margin">Multi de diis prava ſentiunt, id enim vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioſo more effici ſolet, omnes tamen eſſe vim &amp; naturam divinam arbitrantur. <hi>Cic. l. 1. Tuſc.</hi>
                  </note> the
Maker of the World, and the
other, but <hi>Deos populares,</hi> popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Gods.</p>
               <p>And this acknowledgment of a Deity is not
ſprung up in Later Times, but hath been from
the beginning; neither is it confined only to
ſome one Nation, but is in every Nation: So
that what we can plead ſo Ancient <hi>preſcription</hi>
for, and the ſuffrage of all mankind, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a great Truth, and a Truth that is ſown
in Nature it ſelf. Now what an undeniable
Evidence is this of the Being of God, when
it is ſo <hi>legibly</hi> written in every Man's Heart.</p>
               <p>Not that the Notice hereof is ſo clear and
operative, as it was in Man's ſtate of Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
yet ſomething ſtill remains of the <hi>old</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,
which is renewed and quickned by
the Spirit, through the Written Word, where
it doth inhabit. As an <hi>Ancient</hi> writing in <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
that ſtill remains, though much cover'd and
obſcur'd with duſt; yet as the duſt is rubbed
off, ſo the Writing appears Legible again:
It's true ſome Men ſeem to have no <hi>Conſcience</hi>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:64312:79"/>
and ſence of a <hi>Deity;</hi> yet this is no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
but that Conſcience is Univerſal to Men:
Even as the Sottiſhneſs or Diſtraction of ſome
Mens Reaſon, is no Argument againſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
being an <hi>Vniverſal</hi> Principle in Men.</p>
               <p>4. We may argue from the Souls <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality:</hi>
To what purpoſe ſhould it Survive the
Body, if there be no God? For if it ſurvive,
as I ſhall afterwards ſhew, it muſt <hi>Survive</hi> to
ſome end; and this end cannot be with reſpect
to any Creature, and therefore it muſt be with
reſpect to God. It doth not Survive with reſpect
to the enjoyment of the ſenſual things of this
World, for in its <hi>ſeparate ſtate</hi> it hath no need
of them; neither with reſpect to any Homage
and Service to be performed to the Angels,
for it owes no ſuch thing to them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it muſt be with reſpect to ſome other
end: And he that denyes the <hi>Being</hi> of God,
cannot imagine to what end the Soul ſhould
continue for ever.</p>
               <p>But becauſe there is a God, who is an
<hi>Eternal</hi> Being, therefore are there Creatures
made by him that are of an Eternal durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that in them he might have glory for ever.</p>
               <p>Now that the Soul is Immortal, appears,
Becauſe in the Creation of the World there
is diſtinction made in the Creatures; Thoſe
that were to have Corruptible Natures, were
formed out of Corruptible Matter; but thoſe
that were to abide for ever, were by Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Creation, as Angels, as alſo the Souls of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:64312:79"/>
Men; of which it is ſaid, <hi>God breathed into
Man the breath of Life, and he became a living
Soul.</hi> Which the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> refers to,
in chap. 2. 15. <hi>And did he not make One, yet
had he the Reſidue of the Spirit:</hi> which ſhews
the Divine Original of the Soul, proceeding
immediately from the Divine Spirit.</p>
               <p>Was the Soul of Man Mortal and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
God could and would have educed it
out of thoſe Senſitive Spirits that were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created
with the <hi>Chaos,</hi> as he did the Souls
of Beaſts, Fiſhes, and the Fowls of the Air;
but becauſe he did immediately breathe it into
Man, it ſhews that it is of a different Nature
from them, and doth not, as they do, return
to Corruption.</p>
               <p>But to Demonſtrate this from Reaſon, as
well as from Scripture, which it may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
an Atheiſt will deny.</p>
               <p>1. It is Irrational to conceive, that there
ſhould never be a reſpect given to <hi>Virtue</hi> more
than Vice; to Righteouſneſs than Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs:
Seeing it is written in every Mans
Nature, that the one is better then the other.
Now in this Life we ſee it not; <hi>there is one
event to the Righteous and the Wicked.</hi> And
even in the Deaths of Men it is not viſible nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>For how dieth the wiſe Man? as the Fool,</hi>
as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks; And therefore it muſt be
after Death; was the Soul Mortal, wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
would eſcape the hands of Juſtice, and
Holineſs would never meet with the rewards
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64312:80"/>
of Grace: Seeing God made the World, he
alſo neceſſarily muſt Govern it, if he Govern
it, it is in <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and Righteouſneſs. If ſo,
there muſt be different rewards to the <hi>Evil,</hi>
and the <hi>Good:</hi> And therefore the Souls of
Men <hi>neceſſarily</hi> muſt ſurvive to receive thoſe
rewards.</p>
               <p>2. God hath made but two ſorts of <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent</hi>
Creatures in the Univerſe, Angels and
Men: And theſe are more immediately made
for the Glory of their Creator, who as he
is the <hi>King Eternal,</hi> and <hi>Immortal,</hi> ſo the Glory
that is ſuitable to him, muſt be Eternal and
Immortal; which he cannot have but from
Immortal Creatures that live for ever; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be the Glory of Mercy or of Juſtice.
And as he hath the Glory of both in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
ſome always beholding the Face of God,
and the others that fell, caſt down to Hell,
and delivered into chains of Darkneſs, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 4. So will he have the ſame of Men, the
one, in thoſe that are ſaved; and in them that
periſh, the other: And this could not be,
did not the Souls of Men abide for ever.</p>
               <p>3. Whence is it that the Souls of Men
have reſpect to a future ſtate, which no other
Creatures have: Some have reſpect to it with
fear, and terrour; ſome with hope, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
               <p>And however ſome Men that are wholly <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merst</hi>
in a Life of Senſuality, concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
little about it, yet when they come to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64312:80"/>
leave this World, they cannot but have ſome
thoughts concerning it; and then, though it
may be too late, will be making ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
for it.</p>
               <p>And if we look to the Heathen Nations,
that had only the Light of Nature to ſee by,
we ſhall find they had all ſome rude Notions
of a future State: Hence were their Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Olympus, Elyſium,</hi> or a ſtate of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
of their <hi>Pluto, Proſerpina, Rhadamanthus,
Cerberus, Styx,</hi> and their <hi>Dirae,</hi> or <hi>Canes Sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giae;</hi>
which ſhew'd the Notions they had in
their Souls of a State of Miſery after Death.
And the Poets fictions of <hi>Tantalus, Siſiphus,
Ixion,</hi> and others, that were ſuffering Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of ſeveral kinds in Hell; which ſhews
they had ſome apprehenſions of the Souls
ſurvival after it leaves the Body. And as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
argues againſt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,<note place="margin">Imo cur in totum times mortem, ſi nihil est tibi timendum post mortem, nec ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periendum poſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem? <hi>&amp;c. Tertul. Teſt. animae, p.</hi> 88.</note>
If there was no ſurvival
of the Soul, what need Men
to fear Death; <hi>You may ſay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it cuts Men off from the
Commodities and Comforts of
Life: But it delivers Men from all the Sorrows
and Troubles of Life, which uſually exceed the
other.</hi> And therefore, for it ſelf, it ought
not to be feared: And when Men fear it,
it is an Argument of ſome ſtate of Miſery
after it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:64312:81"/>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But theſe were but ſome confuſed
Notions, and uncertain Conjectures, and ſo prove
nothing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Since the Fall of Man all thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Notions of Knowledge, and Principles
of Righteouſneſs, that were Concreated with
the Soul are diſordered, and darkned; and
amongſt the reſt, that Knowledge the Soul had
of it ſelf, and its own Immortality. But thoſe
that yet remain, though Confuſed and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
do ſhew the prints and foot-ſteps of
what it once more perfectly was poſſeſſed of.
As the Ruins of ſome Ancient ſtately Edifice,
do darkly ſhew that there hath been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuch a ſtately ſtructure in Being.</p>
               <p>When meer Nature did lead the Heathen
to ſuch (though very rude) Conceptions of
the future State of the Soul, it hath a ſtrong
Argument in it for ſuch a State. And thoſe
Natural Principles and Characters in the Soul,
that the Goſpel doth Confirm and clear up to
us, to be ſure were Originally placed there by
God himſelf: As its of the Immortality is one,
which we find the Goſpel doth give abundant
Light and Teſtimony to. And ſo it may
be an Argument to us that have the Goſpel,
though not to the Heathen that had it
not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But theſe apprehenſions that the
Heathen had of the future State of the Soul,
were at first deviſed for Political ends, to keep
people the better under Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:64312:81"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Thoſe Heathen that lived under
no Government, had ſuch apprehenſions.
And 2. Such Political devices would have
had but little <hi>Influence</hi> to ſuch an end, was
there not a Natural (though but a confuſed)
Notion of ſuch a ſtate radically in the Hearts
of Men: For no Man came from the dead ſo
as to tell the World of the ſtate of ſeparate
Souls, and therefore for Men to have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ſome reſpect to a future ſtate, it ſhews
there is a Natural and <hi>Connate</hi> notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in the Souls of Men.</p>
               <p>Neither is it an Argument to be ſlighted,
whereby ſome have proved the Souls Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
from Mens Natural deſire to <hi>Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize</hi>
their Name; which ſhews the Soul doth
look beyond its preſent ſtate, which the Soul
of a Brute doth not: As appears by <hi>Abſolon's</hi>
Pillar, ſet up by him to preſerve his Name.
And that Fellow that is ſaid to burn <hi>Diana's</hi>
Temple, that he might perpetuate his Name.
And how did the Poets pleaſe themſelves, that
by their <hi>Poems</hi> they ſhould have their Names
preſerved after their death. <hi>Multaque pars mei
vitabit Libitinam,</hi> ſaid <hi>Horace;</hi> A great part of
me ſhall eſcape death, he means his Name ſhall
not die. As he ſaith in the concluſion of his
<hi>Odes,</hi> as I remember, <hi>Exegi monumentum aere
perennius,</hi> &amp;c. He had raiſed, he ſaith, a
<hi>Monument,</hi> to his Name, more laſting than Braſs,
whereby he ſhould live in the World after
death. And ſo <hi>Ovid,</hi> with reſpect to one
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64312:82"/>
of his chief Poems adds this Concluſion.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Jamque opus exegi quod nec <hi>Jovis</hi> ira nec ignes,</l>
                  <l>Nec ferrum, nec poſſit edax abolere vetuſtas.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Not time, <hi>Joves</hi> wrath, not Sword, or fire,</l>
                  <l>Can ever make this work expire.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>We ſee by this, the Natural deſire of the
Soul to Immortality. And becauſe theſe
Heathen were without the Light of the Word
to direct them to the true Immortality of
Heaven, therefore they ſought it, by provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
an Immortality to their Names here on
Earth. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> much Inſiſts upon this
Argument, <hi>lib. de Teſt. animae,</hi> and Argues
thus, <hi>Vnde anima hodie affectaret aliquid quod
velit post mortem, &amp; tantopere praepararet quo
ſit uſura post obitum ſi nihil de poſtero ſciret,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Why ſhould the Soul be ſo ſolicitous to prepare for
the enjoyment of ſomething after death, if it did
not ſurvive the grave.</hi> And he inſtanceth in
the <hi>Curtii</hi> and <hi>Reguli,</hi> who contemned their
lives that they might have a Name after
death.</p>
               <p>5. The Soul of Man is capable of fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
a Conception of God, and that is an
Argument that <hi>God</hi> is: To what purpoſe
ſhould ſuch a <hi>Capacity</hi> be in the Soul, if there
was no ſuch Object? To what purpoſe was
the faculty of <hi>ſeeing,</hi> if there was no viſible
Objects in Nature? Had the Soul no higher
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64312:82"/>
end then to animate an Earthly Body, and
to guide Men about the affairs of this lower
World, it needed not to have a Capacity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
them.</p>
               <p>And though we know little of the <hi>Divine
Being,</hi> and our higheſt Conceptions, are but
ſome low <hi>Adumbrations</hi> of it, yet the Soul is
not altogether deſtitute of them, though in a
faln ſtate, And that may ſhew that theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
were far higher in it before its
fall.</p>
               <p>I ſhall illuſtrate this Argument by Inſtances
in ſeveral of the <hi>Divine</hi> Attributes, that are
Eſſential to the Being of God: Of all which
the Mind is Capable of framing a Conception,
though not to comprehend them.</p>
               <p>1. Is God's eternity; it is eſſential to his
Being to be eternal: And the Mind is capable
of running back in its thoughts beyond the
Beginning of time, which is eternity, <hi>a parte
ante,</hi> and forward beyond the end of time,
yea to an endleſs duration; which is eternity
<hi>a parte post.</hi> It is able to lanch it ſelf out into
that wide Ocean.</p>
               <p>For whence is it that we have in Divinity a
definition given us of eternity;
<hi>Interminabilis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Boetius.</note> 
                  <hi>perfecta, &amp; tota
ſimul vitae poſſeſſio; An endleſs,
entire, and perfect poſſeſſion of life all at once;</hi>
but that the Mind can frame ſome concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

2. Is Immenſity, or Omnipreſence. The
Mind can inlarge it ſelf to the utmoſt <hi>Sphaere</hi>
of the World's Circumference; yea it can
imagine a Sphaere beyond that Sphaere, and a
ſpace comprehended in no Sphaere; as ſome
of the Philoſophers had Notions of an <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
ſpace</hi> before the World's Creation. It
can alſo conceive of a Being whoſe preſence
may be extenſive to this vaſt ſpace; and
may extend beyond the utmoſt <hi>Sphaere</hi> of the
Univerſe, whom the Heaven of Heavens
cannot contain; yea it can conceive of God
according to the Philoſophers deſcription of
him. <hi>He is a Being whoſe Centre is every
where, and his Circumferance no where.</hi>
Though I muſt ſay, this conception is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Mind's finiteneſs, not God's Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſs.</p>
               <p>3. Is Univerſality of perfection and Being.
Though particulars and Individuals are the
only object of Sence, for <hi>Vniverſalia non
incurrunt in Senſum; Vniverſals do not run
into the Sence;</hi> yet the Mind is able to frame
an <hi>abſtract</hi> Notion of Univerſality: As of
Light, Life, Beauty, Strength, Wiſdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
as they are in themſelves without reſpect to
any <hi>Individual</hi> Subject wherein they may
exiſt. It can ſurveigh this whole Creation,
and all the perfections of it, and then can
conceive of a <hi>Being</hi> that may have all theſe
perfections eminently in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:64312:83"/>
The <hi>Philoſophers</hi> of old in their ſearch of
Nature did raiſe up their Minds from <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals</hi>
to apprehend a <hi>Species</hi> containing all
the Individuals; and then by a more <hi>abſtract</hi>
thought, to apprehend a <hi>Genus</hi> that contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the <hi>Species.</hi> And from thence they rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
their Minds to a Conception of <hi>Ens,</hi> or
Being it ſelf, which is <hi>Genus Generaliſſimum.</hi>
Now God is an Univerſal Perfection, and
Univerſal Being; and the Mind though in a
low degree, can frame a conception of his
Univerſality. As <hi>Seneca</hi> a Moral Heathen,
ſaid of God, <hi>Totum est quod vides, &amp; totum
est quod non vides; He is all that thou ſeest,
and all which thou dost not ſee;</hi> ſuch an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Notion did his Mind frame of God.</p>
               <p>4. Is Simplicity. Though our eyes never
ſaw ſuch a thing in any Creature, neither can
we find it abſolutely in any Creature either
in Heaven or Earth, yet the Mind can frame
a Conception of it; which is one of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>Attributes</hi> of God, that he is without
any Compoſition, or any diverſity in his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in the moſt abſtract and refined Notion
of it. As the School-Men have given us a
deſcription of this attribute, which ſhews the
Mind can conceive ſomething of it. 1. That
God is without Parts, either <hi>Similar,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegral,</hi>
as the Body of Man hath. 2. That
he is without <hi>matter and form,</hi> as we ſee in
the Conſtitution of Man, and other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
3. He is without general and ſpecial
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:64312:84"/>
Nature; as Man hath a <hi>general</hi> Nature, as he
is a living Creature; and ſpecial, as he is
a Man. 4. Without quality; as diſtinct from
Eſſence; or Accidents, as diſtinct from Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:
as may be found in all Creatures, the
very Angels not excepted. 5. Without <hi>Act</hi>
and <hi>Power,</hi> as diſtinct things: That is, God
cannot be poſſibly any thing that he is not,
or ceaſe to be what he is. 6. Without any
diſtinction of Eſſence, and Exiſtence, which
ſome call Being, and Individuation: As we
can diſtinguiſh betwixt the common Nature
of Man, which is Humanity; and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
of this Nature in <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>John,</hi> or
any Individual Perſon: So that there is no
ſhadow of any compoſition, diſtinction, or
as ſome call it, <hi>Alterity</hi> in his Being: But
he is all perfection of Being, not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſively,
but in the greateſt Purity, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Actuality: And ſo I might proceed
to ſpeak of other properties of his Being,
but theſe I only mention to ſhew the Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that is in the Mind of Man, to frame a
<hi>Phyſical,</hi> or rather a <hi>Metaphyſical,</hi> conception of
a Deity, and the ſeveral properties Eſſential to
it; and from hence to draw a rational proof
of God's Being.</p>
               <p>6. Laſtly, We may Argue from thoſe <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi>
Notions of Good and Evil, that are
naturally in the Soul of Man; whereby that
which is morally Good is approved, and the
contrary is diſapproved: As we ſee it among
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64312:84"/>
the Indians, and other Heathens, who have
not only Natural Reaſon to diſcern, but have
a <hi>moral</hi> Judgment to approve the good, and
to diſprove the evil. And amongſt many of
them Injuſtice, Fraud, Violence, Oppreſſion,
are ſeverely puniſht, and the contrary rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and commended. As the Apoſtle ſpeaks
of the <hi>Gentiles, that though they were without
the Law, yet they did by Nature the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Law.</hi> Now whence is this?
why ſhould Juſtice be rather approved of
then Injuſtice, Honeſty then Diſhoneſty? but
that the Soul did <hi>Originally</hi> ſpring from ſome
Fountain of goodneſs, that did derive ſome
reſemblance, and imprint ſome <hi>Characters</hi> of
his own Nature upon it. The Reliques of
which the School-Men call <hi>Syntereſis,</hi> which
are yet found in Man; And by Philoſophers
are called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; Common
Principles, and Anticipations; preceding all
acquired Habits or Principles, by Education,
Experience, or Cuſtom.</p>
               <p>How is it poſſible to believe a diſtinction of
Good and Evil, and a Conſcience about
them ſhould be naturally inherent in every
Man, as we find it is, unleſs ſome <hi>Superior</hi>
Power had fixed ſuch Principles in us by our
firſt conſtitution; and left an indelible <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
in our own Souls about them: So that
no Man can, if he would, in his ſober Mind
think Evil to be better then Good, and in
his ſerious thoughts prefer it before it:
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:64312:85"/>
wherein we have Nature to be our <hi>Miſtreſs</hi>
and Teacher. And who was the Teacher of
Nature? <hi>Tertullian</hi> will Anſwer for me, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtra
natura, anima diſcipula: Quicquid aut
illa edocuit, aut iſta perdidiſcit a Deo traditum
est, Magiſtro ſcilicet ipſius Magiſtrae: Nature
is the Miſtreſs, the Soul the Diſciple; what ever
the one hath Taught, and the other hath Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
is derived from God, who is the Maſter of
the Miſtreſs her ſelf,</hi> Teſt. animae adu: Gentes.
And from hence it was that the <hi>Barbarous</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
mention'd, <hi>Act.</hi> 28. when they ſaw the
Viper faſten upon St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s hand, ſaid, <hi>This
Man is a Murderer, whom, though he hath
eſcaped the Sea, yet Vengeance ſuffers not to
live.</hi> Nature it ſelf taught them that Murther
was not only in it ſelf an Evil, but that Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
would purſue the Murtherer.</p>
               <p>And though ſince ſin entred the Nature
of Man, fleſhly luſts do precipitate Men to
acts of moral unrighteouſneſs, yet it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they offer <hi>Violence</hi> to that Light and
Law of Nature that is planted in their
Hearts.</p>
               <p>And hence it is that we find many of the
<hi>Heathen</hi> loved Juſtice for its own ſake, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any reſpect to profit or praiſe of Men;
as ſeeing a native <hi>Pulchritude,</hi> and goodneſs
in it, conform to the inward Rule and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
that was within themſelves: Such as
<hi>Socrates, Ariſtides, Fabritius, Licurgus, Solon,</hi>
and the like. It was once argued by an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64312:85"/>
then Philoſopher, <hi>If there be a</hi> God, <hi>whence
is it that we ſee</hi> Evil <hi>in the World; if there
be no</hi> God, <hi>whence is it that</hi> Good <hi>is in the
World:</hi> He thought the good found therein
might be an Argument for the <hi>Being</hi> of God;
though he doubted it, for want of knowledge
how Evil did firſt ariſe. But to us that
know that Evil came not from God, but
from ſome other cauſe, the <hi>Argument</hi> is
ſtrong, There is a Natural Goodneſs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is a God.</p>

               <p>THus I have endeavoured to demonſtrate

               <p>
                  <hi>Infer.</hi> I. Firſt, He that made Man muſt
needs know him. He that made a Watch,
or Clock, knows every pin in it, and the
motion of every wheel. So doth God know
the Soul in all the faculties of it, knows what
it can do, what it can not do; What are the
apprehenſions, <hi>volitions,</hi> and inclinations of it;
What are the <hi>regular,</hi> and what are the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi>
motions of it; What principles are in
the Mind, how reſented by the Will, how
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:64312:86"/>
they are entertained in the Affections: He
knows what it doth, what it would do,
what it will not do. So that as it is ſaid of
Chriſt, he needed not that any ſhould <hi>teſtifie</hi> of
Man, for he knew what was in Man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 25.</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>David</hi> in the 139. <hi>Pſalm,</hi>
ſpeaks of God's exact knowledge of him;
Firſt, in General, <hi>O God thou haſt ſearched and
known me,</hi> v. 1. And then particularly, <hi>Thou
underſtandeſt my thoughts afar off,</hi> v. 2. <hi>Thou
compaſſest my path, and art acquainted with all
my ways,</hi> v. 3. <hi>There is not a word in my
mouth, but thou knowest it altogether,</hi> v. 4.
As if he ſhould ſay, Thou knoweſt what I
think, what I ſpeak, what I do: And he
giveth a twofold reaſon of this knowledge
God had of him: One was, becauſe he was
every where preſent with him, <hi>v.</hi> 7. 8, 9, 10.
And the other, becauſe he made him and
formed him; <hi>Thou haſt poſſeſſed my reins, thou
hast covered me in my Mothers womb,</hi> v. 13.
<hi>My ſubſtance was not hid from thee, when I
was made in ſecret,</hi> v. 15. <hi>In thy Book were
all my members written,</hi> v. 16. God laid the
draught of him, and made him, and therefore
muſt needs have a perfect knowledge of him.</p>
               <p>And from this knowledge of God a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
may form, to himſelf, matter both of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Conſolation.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Caution,</hi> Ought we not then take heed
to our ſelves, when God hath ſuch perfect
knowledge of us? Our actions are all known
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:64312:87"/>
to him, y ea our words, yea our thoughts:
The very frame and conſtitution of our moſt
inward man is known to him: What neither
Men or Angels know of us, or can know,
that God knows. The <hi>Anatomist</hi> that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects
the Body, and diſcerns all its ſecret Veins
and Arteries, and the ſmalleſt <hi>Fibrae's</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth not ſo exactly know it, as God
doth know it that made it, and he knows
alſo that Spirit that dwels in it, it being the
work of his own hand: Doth the Spirit in
Man know the things of Man? yet God knows
them better then the Spirit of Man; yea, he
knows the Spirit it ſelf, and that better then
it knows it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Let then Chriſtians walk continually under
an awful ſence of this: And take heed of all
ſin, becauſe it is all known, eſpecially that of
Hypocriſie; an Hypocrite pleaſeth himſelf
that he is not known to Men: But let him
conſider that he is known to his own <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
and that condemns him; And he is
known better to <hi>God</hi> then to his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and therefore God will condemn
much more, as knowing all things, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.
20. And ſuppoſe a Man ſhould be <hi>unknown</hi>
to himſelf, as we know the Heart of Man is
deceitful not only to the deceiving of others,
but even of it ſelf, yet nothing in the <hi>Heart
is hid to God;</hi> So that when the queſtion is
put, <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, who
can know it?</hi> It is anſwered, <hi>I the Lord ſearch the

               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:64312:87"/>
It ſhould ingage every Chriſtian to ſearch
and know his own Heart, becauſe it is ſearched
and known of God: That he that knows the
Heart may find <hi>uprightneſs,</hi> and truth in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parts, which he is ſaid to Love.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Conſolation,</hi> A true Chriſtian may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
himſelf in God's <hi>knowledge</hi> of him.</p>
               <p>1. That God knows the weakneſs of our
Nature, carries comfort in it to his people.
As 103. <hi>Pſalm 14. He knoweth our frame, he
remembreth that we are dust:</hi> He knows he
made us at firſt out of the duſt, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
it ſtill, and as he makes it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
an <hi>Argument</hi> of pity, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks
in the 13. <hi>verſe,</hi> ſo we may thence alſo frame
an Argument to our own comfort in the daily
feeling we have of it.</p>
               <p>2. That he alſo knows the Heart, is no ſmall
comfort to the upright in Heart. And that 1. In
reſpect of the <hi>obloquies,</hi> cenſures, and misjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Men. 2. In reſpect of the failings and
defects that attend our Services: God can look
through them all, to that integrity that is
in the Heart which is known to him: <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>
was guilty of many failings, but he had
this to comfort him, that his Heart was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
with God, and that God knew this,
for he prays God to <hi>remember</hi> it, 38. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.
3. In reſpect of <hi>Inability</hi> to perform what
good we deſire: God doth not only know
what we act, but that deſire of the Heart out
of which we act, and where the Deſire is
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:64312:88"/>
beyond the Act, as it is in all true Saints,
God knows that deſire to accept it, though
the <hi>Act</hi> falls ſhort of it: <hi>David</hi> was under
ſuch a deep ſence of God's goodneſs to him,
that he knew not how ſufficiently to expreſs
his thankfulneſs, but he comforts himſelf in
this, that God knew him, 2 <hi>Sam. 7. And
what can</hi> David <hi>ſay more unto thee for thou
knowest thy ſervant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Infer.</hi> II. If God be the Creator of Man,
it followes that Man is not his own, God
hath a ſupreme right to him as his Maker:

made us, and not we our ſelves.</hi> And this Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Right of God cannot be alienated,
either by any extrinſick Power, or by any
<hi>Compact</hi> made by our ſelves: Though Men
ſell themſelves to work wickedneſs as <hi>Ahab</hi>
did, yet they cannot ſell away God's right
to them as their Creator. As he that is the
true <hi>proprietor</hi> will claim his goods where he
ſinds them, though ſold over and over by
ſuch as had no right.</p>
               <p>And therefore for Men to be their own,
and live to themſelves, hath a manifold Evil
wrapt up in it.</p>
               <p>1. It is Ingratitude; If it be <hi>Ingratitude</hi>
not to improve, and devote the additional
Comforts of our Being to God, much more
not to devote our <hi>Being</hi> it ſelf. <hi>Being</hi> it ſelf
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:64312:88"/>
is the greateſt favour we receive from him,
and therefore it is the greateſt unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
not to give him the Praiſe of it, by
living to him. If any of us ſhould raiſe a
Man into ſome good condition in the World,
and then ſhould not be acknowledged by him
that is thus raiſed, we ſhould juſtly brand him
with <hi>Ingratitude:</hi> Much more Ingratitude is
it not to acknowledge God that hath raiſed
us out of <hi>Non-being</hi> into Being. When <hi>Paul</hi>
deſired a favour of <hi>Philemon,</hi> with reſpect to
<hi>Oneſimus,</hi> he preſſeth it by this Argument that
he could tell him, that <hi>he owed himſelf unto
him, Philem.</hi> 19. It would have been great
ingratitude had <hi>Philemon</hi> denyed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
though he did not owe himſelf to the
Apoſtle in that Supreme and abſolute Right
as we owe our ſelves to God. And he that
made us <hi>reaſonable</hi> Creatures could have made
us Brutes; ought we not then to be thankful
to our <hi>Creator</hi> for making us ſuch, and no
Man is truly thankful that is his own, and
reſerveth himſelf from him.

               <p>3. It is folly; ſhould a Man live to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
when he cannot make himſelf happy?
Happineſs is that which all deſire; why
ſhould then Man make himſelf his End, when
he cannot be his own happineſs? was Man
<hi>ſelf ſufficient</hi> he need not go out of himſelf,
but be his own Principle, Rule, and End,
But ſeeing he is not ſufficient to his own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
it is folly for him to live to himſelf. If
Man in his <hi>fullest</hi> ſtate of perfection was not
his own happineſs, how much leſs can he be

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64312:89"/>
changeth his <hi>ultimate end</hi> from himſelf to
God, he now returns to the true Wiſdom,
and is delivered from that folly that ſin had

               <p>Two things are requiſite to Man's happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

is, That he poſſeſs that <hi>poſitive</hi> good that is
ſuitable, and every way ſatisfactory to his
Nature, as he is a rational Creature; But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of theſe can man effect for himſelf. For
the former, Can he deliver himſelf from <hi>ſin,</hi>
which is the worſt of all Evils, and that
Wrath, Curſe, and Death, which he lies ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to upon the account of it? We ſee
he cannot deliver himſelf from <hi>Temporal</hi>
Evils, which ſeems more in his power to do,
much leſs from thoſe <hi>Eternal</hi> Evils which are
inflicted by God's more immediate hand.</p>
               <p>As to the latter, Can he of himſelf raiſe
up his Soul to the well-head of all true feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
and fetch thence thoſe Living Waters,
that ſhall quench the thirſt of his Soul, and
ſatisfie all his deſires? Can he, having extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
himſelf from thoſe chains of ſin that
held him in bondage, enfranchiſe himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a State and Spirit of true liberty? Can he
enlighten his own mind, and quicken him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into the life of holineſs, when he is dead
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:64312:90"/>
in ſin? Alaſs, how little is it Man can do for
himſelf in any thing, much leſs in theſe great
things wherein his true happineſs conſiſts?
Therefore is it not folly for Man to be his
own, and live to himſelf?</p>
               <p>4. Hereby Man <hi>perverts</hi> the End of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
For God made Man for himſelf: He is
both the <hi>Efficient,</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of his Being. And
making Man for himſelf, he fitted him with
<hi>Faculties</hi> to ſerve his End: As every <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
Agent doth propoſe to himſelf an End in
what he doth, and doth forme means ſuitable
to that End: Now if Man lives to himſelf, he
ſerves not the <hi>End</hi> of his Creation; And
what is a thing good for, if it doth not ſerve
its End?</p>
               <p>Would it not be a <hi>Monſtrous</hi> thing in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
if the <hi>Sun</hi> ſhould not ſhine forth its
light upon the World, which is the end God
made it for? Or if the <hi>Earth</hi> ſhould impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
within it ſelf its <hi>ſeminal</hi> vertue, and not
ſend it forth in thoſe ſeveral fruits that it had
a Commiſſion to do for the uſe of Man and
Beaſt? But we ſee theſe inferior parts of
God's Creation do ſerve their End, and is it
not ſad that the ſupremer part of it, which is
Man, ſhould not ſerve his? May not he
look upon the whole Creation, and then bluſh
at himſelf? And the very Horſe, Man rides
upon, reproves the rider whiles he is ſerving
of him.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Harmony</hi> of the Creation, when
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64312:90"/>
every part of it keeps its place, and ſerves its
End; It is only Man's ſin that hath diſturbed
this harmony, by making Man live to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and ſo not to ſerve his End.</p>
               <p>5. Man's Being is prophaned; As the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting
it to God doth Sanctifie it, ſo not to
do it leaves it Common; Thoſe Beaſts, thoſe
Fruits under the Law that were given to God
were Sanctified, and the reſt were <hi>Common:</hi>
Man doth <hi>Sanctifie</hi> his Being when he cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
from himſelf, and offers up himſelf to
God: It is the Apoſtles exhortation, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi>
1. <hi>Preſent your Bodies,</hi> that is by a <hi>Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche,
your ſelves as a living Sacrifice:</hi> And
then it follows, <hi>holy.</hi> When Man makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a Sacrifice to God, then is his Being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated:
As <hi>Lactantius</hi> tells the
Heathen,<note place="margin">Lib. 5. p. 421.</note> that the Chriſtian Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
was <hi>bona mens, purum pectus, innocens
vita;</hi> A good Mind, pure Heart, innocent
Life.</p>
               <p>And as we are to offer our ſelves to God
as a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> ſo to dedicate our ſelves to
him as his <hi>Temple;</hi> That both Soul and Body
may be his habitation: And we know, under
the Law, after the Temple was built, and
dedicated, it was no longer a Common ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.
<hi>The Temple of God is
Holy,</hi>

World, and all things therein, as we read
<hi>Acts</hi> 17. 24. he now dwels in living Temples
made without hands, which are his people
that ſeparate themſelves unto him.</p>
               <p>And leaſt there ſhould be wanting a Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
with reſpect to the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
The ſame that are the Sacrifice and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> alſo. The <hi>Prieſts</hi> under
the Law were perſons ſeparated from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
men, and Sanctified to God. So they that
<hi>ſeparate</hi> themſelves from the principles and
practiſe of the Carnal World, and live to
the ſervice and honour of God, they are his
<hi>Prieſthood.</hi> As the Apoſtle St. <hi>Peter</hi> writes
to the believing Jews, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9 and ſtiles
them a <hi>Royal Prieſthood,</hi> and ſo a <hi>peculiar,</hi> not
Common, <hi>People;</hi> for they were ſuch as had
been Converted to God by the Goſpel, and
ſo were Sanctified to his ſervice.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing the ſame perſon is both Prieſt
and Sacrifice, that which is off'red up, muſt
needs be a <hi>Free-will offering.</hi> For the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
will offers up the whole Man to God:
And ſeeing it is the whole Man, it is an <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locaust</hi>
alſo that is off'red up, or as ſtiled in
the Law, a Whole burnt Offering.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Infer.</hi> III. But we may hence more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
learn the ſeveral duties Man owes to God
as his Maker.</p>
               <p>1. We owe him Love; We Love them
that give us gifts, how much more ſhouldſt
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64312:91"/>
thou Love him that gave thee thy ſelf? when
<hi>Job</hi> would reckon up what God had done for
him, he inſiſts firſt upon God's giving him
Being, 10. <hi>Job</hi> 10, 11. &amp;c. <hi>Thou hast powred
me out like Milk, crudled me as Cheeſe, cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me with Skin and Fleſh, fenced me with
Bones and Sinews,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou hast granted me
life and favour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this favour of giving thee Being,
is the firſt of God's favours; and it muſt
needs be favour, for no Man could merit of
God to give him Being. And if the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and <hi>accommodation</hi> of our Being in the
World, ſhould ingage us to Love God;
how much more our Creation that gave us
Being: And as every Man doth Love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
becauſe he is himſelf; much more ſhould
we Love him that gave us our ſelves, and that
more then our ſelves.</p>
               <p>2. Fear; For he that gave thee <hi>Being</hi> can
deſtroy it: And he is to be fear'd above all,
for as he alone could give thee Being, ſo he
alone can deſtroy it. The Body may be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and yet Man not deſtroyed; but to have
Soul and Body <hi>cast into Hell,</hi> this deſtroys
Man: now this only God can do, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
ſpeaks, and therefore he is to be chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
feared: And this he will do, if thou feareſt
him not. He that made thee, will not have
Mercy on thee, as it is ſaid 27. <hi>Iſa. 11. Elihu</hi>
had an aw of God upon him, conſidered as
his <hi>Maker,</hi> as appears by his ſpeech, 32. <hi>Job</hi> laſt,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64312:92"/>
                  <hi>I know not how to give flattering titles, in ſo
doing my Maker would ſoon take me away.</hi> He
that ſet me in a <hi>rank</hi> and ſtation of Being,
would remove me, or rather throw me out
of it again. He that made Man hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
Sovereign Power over him; By this <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Power,</hi> he hath right to appoint Man a
Law to govern him. And if Man tranſgreſs
this Law, he violates God's <hi>Sovereignty;</hi> And
therefore it belongs to God, either to pardon
or puniſh the Tranſgreſſion. And upon the
account of both, <hi>God</hi> is to be feared: As
he hath Power to puniſh, ſo we are to fear
him; and as he hath Power to pardon,
ſo we ought to fear him alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. 4.
<hi>There is forgiveneſs with thee that thou mayſt
be feared.</hi> And as God's Sovereign Power
over Man as his Creator, gives him this Right,
ſo his eſſential or Creating Power, gives him
ability to deſtroy the Creature which it gave
Being to. The Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> therefore
bids the people not to fear the Heathen Idols,
10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. And why? <hi>For they cannot do
evil, neither is it in them to do good.</hi> But then
ſpeaking of the true God, adds <hi>v. 7. Who
would not fear thee, O King of Nations? for
to thee doth it appertain:</hi> He can do Good
and Evil, he can ſave or deſtroy Man that
made him, and therefore fear appertains to
him.</p>
               <p>3. Praiſe; As the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> calls upon the
moſt inferior Beings to praiſe God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Beaſts,</hi>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:64312:92"/>
and all <hi>Cattle,</hi> and <hi>creeping things:</hi> how much
more ſhould Man praiſe God that hath ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a Being. <hi>David</hi> conſidering himſelf as
God's Creature and Workmanſhip, breaks
forth into his praiſe, 139. <hi>Pſal. I will praiſe
thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.</hi>
And then he ſpeaks particularly, how God
drew out the <hi>Scheme</hi> of him in his Book, and
then how <hi>his members were faſhioned, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
wrought,</hi> v. 15. 16. Now ſaith <hi>David,
I will praiſe thee;</hi> Even as a curious piece of
Work, every one is ready to commend and
praiſe: The Philoſopher could thank his God
that he made him a Man, and then for the
advantages he afterwards conferred upon his
humane Nature. Ought we to praiſe God
for our Food, that preſerves Life? much more
for Life it ſelf, that is better then Food,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 25.</p>
               <p>4. Submiſſion; Will he correct and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
thee, ſubmit and give him <hi>reverence:</hi>
Do we ſo to the <hi>Fathers</hi> of our Fleſh, that
are but inſtruments to give us our Fleſh and
ſhall we not much more do it to the Father of
Spirits, that is the Efficient and Creator of
the Spirit? As the Apoſtle argues, 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.
Hath he made thee <hi>out of the clay,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. Hath he given thee Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and may he not diſpoſe of it as he will:
Hath not the Potter power over the <hi>clay</hi> to
make it, and faſhion it as he pleaſeth? He
that built an Houſe may alter it and change
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:64312:93"/>
it; yea and pull it down if he pleaſe.</p>
               <p>God hath a twofold dominion over Man,
<hi>Dominium juriſdictionis, &amp; proprietatis.</hi> A
Dominion of juriſdiction, whereby to rule
over us, and a Dominion of property to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe
of us: And both theſe are founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the higheſt and moſt Sovereign Right,
which is that of Creation.</p>
               <p>5. Dependance; Thou hadſt thy <hi>Being</hi> of
him, and thou haſt it ſtill in him: As the
Apoſtle puts both theſe together, 17. <hi>Act.</hi> 28.
<hi>We are his of-ſpring,</hi> that is, we have our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him;<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> and ſaith alſo, <hi>We
live, move, and Be in him:</hi> Our
preſervation is but a continued Creation.
We ſubſiſt every moment in the firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of our Being; As the <hi>beams</hi> ſubſiſt in the
Sun from whence they ſpring.</p>
               <p>Thy Life depends more upon him, then
upon the Bread: <hi>Man liveth not by Bread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
but by every word that commeth out of
the mouth of God.</hi> That word that firſt gave
Man his life, is that upon which it ſtill prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
depends: And it is that which <hi>Job</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth;
<hi>Thou haſt given me life, and
favour, and thy viſitation preſerveth my ſpirit,
Job</hi> 10 9, 10.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Natural</hi> dependance upon God,
ſhould teach Man a <hi>Moral</hi> dependance upon
him: Man's ſtate is paſſively a ſtate of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance,
and therefore his life ſhould be
actively a life of dependance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:64312:93"/>
Should we not then in all our ways acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
him? <hi>And trust in him with all our
Hearts, and not leane to our own underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding?</hi>
3. <hi>Pro.</hi> 5, 6. what ever means thou
uſeſt for the welfare of thy Soul or Body,
yet depend not upon them, but upon him
that is the <hi>Creator</hi> of both: Let that infinite
Power, <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and Goodneſs, out of which
thy Being flowes, be the objects of thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
for thy well being.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially ſeeing we have theſe ingaged to
us (if we are believers) in an <hi>Everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
to be exerted for our ſuccor and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
in every time of need: So that we may
now depend upon him, and commit our ſelves
to him, not only as a Wiſe, Good, and Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
but as a <hi>Faithful Creator, 1 Pet.</hi> 4. 19.
Conſidering that the Soul and Body that
were made by him, are not under his care
only by the common Laws of Creation and
providence, but by ſpecial Covenant.</p>
               <p>6. Obedience to his Law, I mean his
Written Law; I know this Law comprehends
in it all the foregoing duties, which are in
themſelves <hi>Naturally</hi> moral, and by vertue of
God's Law are made <hi>Poſitively</hi> moral; but
yet this Law of God being of further extent,
I ſhall therefore ſpeak of it under a diſtinct
head.</p>
               <p>God, as Man's <hi>Creator,</hi> hath right to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
him the Law and Rule of his Life, and
Actions; and ſo as his Creatures we owe him
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:64312:94"/>
obedience. All Creatures are paſſively un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Natural Law, which the Creator did
appoint to them; and which is obſerved by
them, though many of them know it not;
But Man is under a Written Law, which he is
actively to obey. He being a <hi>Reaſonable</hi>
Creature, he is capable of knowing the rule
and end of his being, which the other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are not: And both theſe are laid down
in the Scriptures. Conſider then, 1. God is
Man's Creator. 2. He Created him for an
End. 3. He hath given him a Law and Rule
to walk by in order to that End. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
Man lies under the higheſt obligation
to Obedience, it being the Law of him that
made him: And Man's obedience to <hi>God</hi>
ought to be abſolute; Though it ought not to
be ſo to Men, becauſe God's dominion over
us is ſuperior to that of all Men, and ſo may
ſuperſede and over-rule it.</p>
               <p>And if we think it our duty to obey Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
and Parents that have ſome inferior
power over us, how much more that God
who hath a Supreme Power, and that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the higheſt right, which is that of
Creation.</p>
               <p>And let us particularly ſhew our obedience
to his Law in our worſhip of him: For as
worſhip is due to God as our Creator, as
the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, 95. <hi>Pſal. Oh come let us
worſhip and fall down, and kneel before the
Lord our Maker;</hi> ſo he hath right alſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:64312:94"/>
by to ſet us the rule of our Worſhip. As not
to Worſhip him is Contempt, ſo to Worſhip
otherwiſe then he hath appointed is <hi>Idolatry,</hi>
or Superſtition; yea it is a bold uſurpation of
the Creature upon the Creator. The Apoſtle
calls it Will worſhip, 2. <hi>Col.</hi> becauſe it is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in Man's will and not God's.</p>
               <p>And what though the worſhip God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted,
hath an outſide meanneſs and no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
ſplendor in it, to affect the ſenſe; yet we
are to perform it out of meer obedience. And
obedience hath a Comelineſs and Beauty in it,
though it be in the leaſt matters: And in ſuch
matters, wherein we can ſee no Reaſon for
them, but the will of God; as in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
Offering up his Son, and <hi>Naaman</hi> his waſhing
ſeven times in <hi>Jordan,</hi> &amp;c. And in theſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
is Man's obedience tryed: All <hi>moral</hi>
duties carry ſuch equity and goodneſs in the
Nature of them, that right Reaſon doth <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade</hi>
obedience to them; but theſe that are
duties only by <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> are to be obeyed
though meerly to comply with the Creatours
will. And that God might have this obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
from <hi>Adam</hi> as well as the former, he
forbad him to Eat of <hi>one Tree</hi> of the Garden.
And why one, and not two? why that and
not another only depended upon God's So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
will: And ſuch Inſtitutions we have
ſtill in God's written Word, to which we are
to give obedience, as they bear the ſtamp
of God's Authority, though we ſhould ſee
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:64312:95"/>
no other Reaſon for it. This is the third In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Infer.</hi> IV. Hence we may take notice in the
next place, that Man's ſafeſt and happieſt
<hi>conſiſtance</hi> is in God, he being Man's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and the Fountain of his Being: As we
ſee every thing in Nature hath its beſt <hi>exiſtence</hi>
in the principle out of which it is derived, and
the <hi>Original</hi> out of which it ſprings: As a
<hi>Branch</hi> hath its beſt <hi>exiſtence</hi> in the <hi>Tree, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
in the <hi>Sea, Fire</hi> in its <hi>Element, Earthly
matter</hi> in the <hi>Earth:</hi> So hath <hi>Man</hi> in <hi>God;</hi>
Here is his moſt proper dwelling, and reſting
place: As every thing in Nature hath its
home and centre; But God himſelf is theſe to
Man: And therefore hither ought his motions
tend, as every thing in Nature, is tending
thither where it hath its beſt abode.</p>
               <p>Sin hath ſeparated Man from the <hi>principle</hi>
of his Being, and cut of his <hi>Communion</hi> with
his Creator, and now no wonder though he
finds no <hi>reſting place,</hi> being out of his Centre;
and that his Soul is <hi>withering,</hi> being cut off
from the root of its life.</p>
               <p>Though it is true Man's <hi>natural</hi> Being is ſtill
upheld by the Power and providence of God;
yet as to his <hi>moral</hi> Well-being, ſin hath
made an <hi>interciſion</hi> betwixt God and him.</p>
               <p>But let him not continue thus; But as the
<hi>Child</hi> that is carried from home, cries to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
back again; and taken from the Armes
of its <hi>Parents,</hi> reacheth to come to them
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:64312:95"/>
again; ſo let Man do, let him be crying after
God, to return to him as his true <hi>home,</hi> and
the great <hi>Parent</hi> of his Being.</p>
               <p>Go to him and tell him, thou art his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and he thy Creator, if thou canſt not
yet call him Father; pray him to have pity on
thee, as thou art the work of his Hand: To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
thee, and pardon thee, and to deliver
thee from that ſin which is none of God's work,
yet hath marred his work in thee, and leads
the Creature from his Creator, though it ſelf
be none of his Creatures.</p>
               <p>And we that live under the <hi>Goſpel</hi> have
both direction and encouragement herein:
The Goſpel tells us the way whereby we may
come back to God again, which is Jeſus Chriſt;
When as thoſe that live without it, feel after
him only as Men in the dark (as the Apoſtle
ſpeaks of the Gentiles, 17. <hi>Act.</hi>) wanting a
guide to lead them to him.</p>
               <p>It alſo doth give great <hi>Encouragement</hi> to
Men, by declaring God's infinite readineſs to
receive his returning Creature: It tells us that
Chriſt came from Heaven to declare this readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and ſo he did it all along, when here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth; eſpecially in the three Parables of
the loſt Sheep, the loſt Drachme, and the loſt
Son, 15. <hi>Luk.</hi> But his ſuffering Death to make
way for our return, and to bring us to God,
doth above all abundantly declare it, as the
Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 18. Christ hath
once ſuffered for ſins, the just for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:64312:96"/>
that he might bring us to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Infer.</hi> V. Hence it follows that if God is
our Maker, Man hath no Reaſon to <hi>Glory</hi> in
himſelf; For he hath derived his <hi>Being,</hi> his
<hi>Self</hi> from God: Haſt thou Beauty, Strength,
Parts, and <hi>Endowments</hi> of Mind, but why
ſhouldſt thou Glory? art thou not God's
Creature, haſt thou any thing but what thou
haſt received? It is of him that thou art what
thou art in every thing, except thy ſin; And
wilt thou Glory in that? in that which is thy
ſhame? in that wilt thou <hi>Glory</hi> which hath
ſtript Man of his Glory? Hath he <hi>formed</hi> thee
out of the Clay, <hi>raiſed</hi> thee out of the Duſt,
<hi>clothed</hi> thee with Skin and Fleſh, <hi>breathed</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee the breath of Life; yea, brought thee
out of the Abyſs of nothing into being, (As
<hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of his ſubſtance and members
formed by God, when once <hi>there was none of
them, 139. Pſal.</hi> 16.) and wilt thou Glory in
thy ſelf? Eſpecially wilt thou Glory in thy
ſelf againſt God, and ſay, who is the Lord?
I have Strength, Wit, Wiſdom of mine own,
and why ſhould I be ſubject to him? or what
need I depend upon him. Thus Man comes
to diſown his Creator, and ſets up himſelf as
God, and above him that made him: And as
if he had his <hi>Being</hi> of himſelf, in the pride of
his Heart, ſaith with the Prince of <hi>Tyrus, I AM;</hi>
when as God's Name alone is <hi>I AM,</hi> as God
told <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 3. 14. And as the Greek
word EI was writ upon the gates of <hi>Apollo</hi>'s
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:64312:96"/>
Temple, which ſignifies, <hi>Thou art;</hi> which
intimates what <hi>Notion</hi> the very Heathen had
of God; that he was <hi>Being</hi> it ſelf, and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
ſo that all other Beings muſt be of him.
But Man forgets this, and thinks he is of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and therefore is apt to lay aſide all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to God, and exalt himſelf into his
room.</p>
               <p>And as Man was once nothing <hi>Negatively,</hi>
till God gave him Being, and made him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
ſo he would ſoon return to nothing
again <hi>privatively,</hi> if he was not continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by an <hi>Influx</hi> of Being from the firſt
Being.</p>
               <p>So that, as a late Learned Writer ſpeaks, if
God ſhould ſay to him, or to any Angel in
Heaven, <hi>Accipe quod tuum est, &amp; abi;</hi> Take
that which is thine one, and be gone; they
muſt depart into their firſt nothing: What
hath Man then left him to Glory in?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Infer.</hi> VI. Laſtly, The Saints may hence
draw ſeveral Arguments to plead with God
by, and ſtrengthen their Faith therein: Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in theſe Caſes.</p>
               <p>1. To make proviſion for them; Hath he
given me <hi>Being,</hi> and will he not take care of
that <hi>Being</hi> he hath given me? Hath he given
me <hi>Life,</hi> and will he not give food to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that Life? and a <hi>Body,</hi> and will he not
provide raiment to Cloath it? We know
theſe are Chriſt's Arguments to ſtrengthen his
Diſciples Faith againſt inordinate Cares; in
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:64312:97"/>
the 6. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. Hath he put this <hi>Inſtinct</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all living Creatures to provide for their
young, that proceed from them by Natural
Generation; and is it not then eminently in
God's Nature, that is the Creator of all
things? Hereupon he is ſaid to <hi>feed the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
cloath the graſs of the Field, take care of
Sparrows, and to ſend rain for his Land,</hi> Job
37. 13. And will he not take care of his
people who are a more ſpecial part of his
Creation.</p>
               <p>2. To redeem them from Sin, and Satan, and
the World, the three great Adverſaries of
their Souls. 1. From Sin, we may plead with
God to redeem us from it, that what is no part
of his Creation, may not deſtroy that Soul
that is a chief part of it: That what hinders
us from ſerving the end of our Being, which
is to <hi>Glorifie</hi> our Creator, may not ſtill be
found dwelling in us his Creatures. 2. From
Satan; That we who are God's Creatures,
may be delivered from his <hi>Vſurpation</hi> and <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,</hi>
who hath no right to rule over us:
That he who is the <hi>God</hi> of the World, by
permiſſion and power only, not by any right,
and to whom we owe no ſervice, may not
hinder us in the ſervice of him that is the <hi>true
God,</hi> the Creator, and rightful Governor of
the World, and to whom we owe all ſervice.
3. From the World; Did not God make
Man, and made him <hi>Lord</hi> of his Creation,
and made the Creatures to ſerve him? maiſt
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:64312:97"/>
not thou then plead with God, that he would
help thee to maintain thy <hi>Sovereignty</hi> over
them, that they may not enſlave thy Soul, and
make thee to be ſervant to them? That thou
mayſt not only live as his Creature, but reign
in that <hi>Station</hi> of Sovereignty wherein God
firſt ſet Man, over the World, and things
thereof.</p>
               <p>For as the Poet ſpeaks of Money, <hi>Imperat
aut ſervit,</hi> &amp;c. It is either a Man's Maſter or
his Servant; ſo it may be ſaid of all other
things. A Man may have a <hi>Natural</hi> dominion
over them, and command them for his uſe,
and yet be under a <hi>moral</hi> ſlavery and ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to them, by having his Heart captivated
and enſnared by them: And ſo Man is degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of one great part of that Sovereignty
wherein he was firſt created.</p>
               <p>3. To inſtruct and teach them in their way;
As <hi>David</hi> prays, 119. <hi>Pſal. 73. Thy hands have
made me and faſhioned me, give me underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that I may learn thy Commandments.</hi> As
if he ſhould ſay, Lord, thou haſt given me
my Being, and wilt thou leave me; and not
guide me and lead me, now thou haſt made
me? Or as others, thus, <hi>Thine hands have
made me and faſhioned me,</hi> therefore I owe
thee Obedience, <hi>give me therefore underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that I may learn thy Commandments,</hi> and ſo
give obedience to thee: Or it may be <hi>David</hi>
looks at God as his Father by Creation, and
therefore begs that, as a Father, he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64312:98"/>
him, and learn him his Commandments:
And ſo may the Saints plead, that as God
hath given them Being, ſo he would guide
them in the way to their Well-being.</p>
               <p>4. They may hence plead for <hi>ſupport</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their afflictions; That God would have
<hi>regard</hi> to the work of his hands, that no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
may be above their ſtrength to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,
leaſt it prove deſtructive to the Creature
that he hath made.</p>
               <p>It was <hi>Job's</hi> complaint to God, though he
went too far in it, 10. <hi>Job. 8. Thine hands have
made me and faſhioned me, yet thou doest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
me:</hi> And hence he makes his plea alſo
with God, <hi>Remember I beſeech thee, that thou
hast made me as the clay, and wilt thou bring
me to the dust again?</hi> And <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks this
upon the account of his ſore afflictions.</p>
               <p>And though the Saints may plead with
God by a nearer relation to him then that of
Creation, as being his adopted Children, yet
the former <hi>plea</hi> is not antiquated, as the <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
it ſelf is not nulled. As appears, becauſe
God himſelf from thence draws Arguments
to pity and ſuccour his people: As in the
57. <hi>Iſa. 16. I will not contend for ever, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will I be always wroth, for the Spirit
ſhould fail before me, and the Soul that I have
made:</hi> And that which is an Argument to
himſelf, may be to us to plead with him
by.</p>
               <p>And I may add, we may hence alſo plead
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:64312:98"/>
to be <hi>ſaved</hi> out of affliction, as well as <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported</hi>
under it: For he that firſt created Man
out of the duſt, is able to Create deliverance
to us, when by afflictions we are laid in the
duſt, and brought even to the duſt of Death,
as <hi>David's</hi> expreſſion is, 22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. And we
may believe he is willing as well as able, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Creation was not the effect of his
Power only but of his Goodneſs alſo; and
this goodneſs of his continues ſtill towards his
Creature, whereby to be ready to give it a
<hi>Well-being,</hi> as he firſt gave it <hi>Being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hereupon, <hi>Job</hi> is thought to comfort
himſelf, that God would raiſe his Body out
of the grave, it being his own <hi>Workmanſhip,</hi>
14. <hi>Job 15. Thou wilt call, and I will anſwer;
thou wilt have a regard to the work of thy hands.</hi>
And from that Power and Goodneſs of God
that will raiſe up the Bodies of the Saints at
the laſt day, they may hope for a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
out of the grave of any Temporal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
in this World (only with a ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Creator's will); As the deliverance
of the Jews out of Captivity is ſet forth by the
opening of their graves and making dry bones
to live, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 5, 13.</p>
               <p>5. They may hence alſo plead with God
to reſtore them into a ſtate of <hi>holineſs</hi> and
<hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> ſeeing he made Man firſt in ſuch
a ſtate: For who can reſtore lapſed Man, but
he that firſt made Man; <hi>God made Man upright
at firſt,</hi> and he alone can reſtore him to it again.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:64312:99"/>
After ſin had broke in upon the <hi>Nature</hi> of
Man, and corrupted it; God is ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of his work, that he had made Man;
but in our <hi>Reſtoration</hi> God rejoyceth in his
work again: As our Saviour telleth us, <hi>That
there is joy in Heaven when a ſinner repents,</hi>
15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>And this Reſtoration is called a Creation,
for it brings Man into the Image of God
again; And being a Creation it cannot be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
but by God himſelf. And he that made
Man at firſt after his <hi>Image,</hi> of his own good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
when none did ask it of him; will he
not be ready to <hi>reſtore</hi> it to us when we
ſhall come, and begg it at his hand?</p>
               <p>There is a cry to God as the great Creator
of the World, which is only <hi>vox Naturae,</hi> the
voice of Nature; So every Man is ready to
cry to God in his diſtreſs; Yea the very
brute Creatures thus cry, <hi>The young Lions ſeek
their prey of God;</hi> and the Ravens cry to be
fed, and God is ſaid to hear them: But the
Saints cry is <hi>vox Spiritus,</hi> the voice of God's
Spirit in their Hearts; wherein they make a
<hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>ſpecial</hi> improvement of their
Common relation to God as their Creator,
in all the Caſes formentioned: And though
it be but Common bleſſings they ſometimes
begg, and the good things of Nature, yet
it is by a principle that is ſupernatural.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Infer.</hi> VII. Laſtly, We may hence take
notice of the deſtructive and provoking Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:64312:99"/>
of Sin; It provokes God to deſtroy the
<hi>Creature</hi> that was made by him: Yea that
Creature which he hath beſtowed peculiar
<hi>Workmanſhip</hi> upon. God loves every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as it is his Creature, and much more Man
among his Creatures; how comes it then that
any Man is deſtroyed? it is becauſe ſin hath
got into his Nature, and his firſt armeth him
againſt God his Creator, and thereby his
Juſtice comes to be armed againſt Man his
Creature and he falls before it.</p>
               <p>And therefore let no Man plead for liberty
and impunity in ſin, becauſe he is God's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
As many ignorant people have no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
hope then upon this bottom, <hi>He that made
them will not damn them:</hi> God hath given Man
a Law and Rule to walk by, and provided
means for him in order to his Salvation; but if
Man refuſe thus to walk, and reject the means
of his own happineſs, let him not cenſure his
<hi>Maker</hi> as cruel to his Creature: For it is not
ſo much God's deſtroying Man, as Man's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtroying
himſelf. As if <hi>Jeremy</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
being in the miry Dungeon, and having
Ropes and old raggs let down to him to pull
him out, ſhould yet have refuſed to put them
under his Arms, but will ſtay and periſh there;
<hi>Jeremy</hi> had thereby been the cauſe of his own
death. Or as a wiſe and merciful King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
not to have his Subjects put to death,
but by wilful breaking the Law they bring it
upon themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:64312:100"/>
Neither let any Man ſay God deſtroys his
Creature out of his mere Sovereignty: And
that he made ſome Men on purpoſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
them; And that without any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of their ſin, he decreed them out of
his own pleaſure to everlaſting miſery.</p>
               <p>And therefore here, though in the cloſe of
all, I ſhall vindicate my Text from a corrupt
Interpretation; which though the Grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
conſtruction may bear, yet the Truth will
not;<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>For the Inviſible things of
him from the Creation of the
World are clearly ſeen,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>even
his Eternal Power and God-head, to this end that
they might be without excuſe.</hi> As if to make men
inexcuſable, was God's end in making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
known in the works of Creation, when
it is only a conſequence of it through Man's
default.</p>
               <p>`Some indeed have thought that God out
of his abſolute Sovereignty may take away
from his Creature that which he hath given
it, as Life, and Being; he may annihilate
what he hath Created: but to make his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Eternally miſerable (which is worſe then
a not-Being) meerly out of Sovereignty, this
cannot conſiſt with his Infinite Mercy and
Goodneſs: A Man hath that Dominion over
a Beaſt that he may take away the Life of it if
he pleaſe; but to put his Beaſt out of his mere
pleaſure to perpetual Torment, is perfect cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
and contrary to that mercy and humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:64312:100"/>
that belongs to the perfection of Man's
Nature. And therefore it cannot be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that any ſuch thing can be found in God.
I will aſcribe Righteouſneſs to my Maker,
ſaid <hi>Elihu, Job</hi> 36. 3. And ſo we ought to
aſcribe Mercy and Goodneſs, and all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to that God that made us all, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
Creatures to their Creator.</p>
               <p>God might have choſen whether he would
make ſuch a Creature as Man or not; he did
not owe this to him to give him Being, much
leſs to make him a reaſonable Creature; but
having made ſuch a Creature and put him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Law, now God hath obliged himſelf to
diſpoſe of Man, not according to mere <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty,</hi>
but according to that Law under
which he ſtands.</p>
               <p>And if Men, not ſo much for want of abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as out of ſloth, or hatred, and contempt,
do not comply with this Law, and the terms
of their own happineſs, they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<hi>ſelf-deſtroyers,</hi> as God charged it upon <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
of old, O Iſrael <hi>thou hast, deſtroyed thy
ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as one well ſpeaks, <hi>Deus non prius eſt
ultor quam homo peccator;</hi> God is not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger
till Man is firſt a ſinner: God is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſaid to ſhew mercy for his <hi>Names-ſake,</hi>
but is never ſaid to Plague or Puniſh meerly
for his <hi>Names-ſake.</hi> And therefore why
ſhould Man complain? as <hi>Salvian</hi> expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
with the Chriſtians of his time. <hi>Why do
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:64312:101"/>
we complain that our puniſhment is bitter and
grievous; Vnuſquiſque noſtrum ipſe ſe punit?</hi>
Every Man doth puniſh himſelf, though he
is alſo puniſht of God; God doth it <hi>Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>
as a righteous Judge, but Man doth it
<hi>Meritoriouſly</hi> as a guilty ſinner.</p>
               <p>Not but that God as an <hi>abſolute Sovereign</hi>
may give more of his grace and gifts to one
then another; for he may do what he will
with his own, where he is Indebted to none;
Neither can we conclude becauſe Man's
<hi>deſtruction</hi> is of himſelf, therefore his <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
is of himſelf: For the one Man can effect
of himſelf as <hi>Adam</hi> did, but the other he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
attain without God.</p>
               <p>As the Sheep in the <hi>Parable</hi> that went
aſtray of it ſelf, but came not home till
the Owner found it out, and brought it
back upon his Shoulder, 15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4, 5.</p>
               <p>Man was able to deprive himſelf of
his Original Righteouſneſs, but it is only
God can reſtore it: As Natural privations in
the Body are eaſily made by a Man's own
ſelf, a Man may eaſily deſtroy his own ſight,
but it is beyond his power to reſtore this
habit of ſight: According to the <hi>Axiom</hi> in
Philoſophy, <hi>A privatione ad habitum non da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
regreſſus;</hi> There is no return in Nature
from a privation to the habit again.</p>
               <p>And it is much more true of Spiritual pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
upon the Soul, Man hath been able
to bring them upon himſelf, but he cannot
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:64312:101"/>
of himſelf return to thoſe divine habits that
he is deprived of.</p>
               <p>So that in thoſe that are Saved, God will
have his Grace and Mercy <hi>magnified,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Saved by himſelf; ſo, in thoſe that
Periſh, he will have his Juſtice <hi>magnified,</hi> as
being deſtroyed by themſelves.</p>
               <p>Men Periſh by their own Will, but againſt

and as revealed in his Word. For elſe
Men Periſh by God's conſequent Will, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
rejected the means of their own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So that I ſhall Conclude in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive

God's Will of Man's Converſion as ordinative
of means is accompliſhed in this; That there
is a ſerious exhibition of the means in order
to Converſion as their proper end, and that
end, (but for Man's voluntary Corruption)
would be thereby attained, even in all.</p>
