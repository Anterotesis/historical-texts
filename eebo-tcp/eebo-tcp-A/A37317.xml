            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Wiſdome of God doth principally conſiſt in ſhewing the Excellency of his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip
<pb facs="tcp:51993:10"/>
in poor, deſpicable, and contemptible things. For an Artiſt is more to be eſteemed, that can perfectly make the Image of a Flie, then be that carveth out an Elephant; groſs work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring leſs skill then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile. So the Creator hath ſhewed more wiſdome in the production of a Flie, then of an Elephant. Whence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, That if one would undertake to conſider the Makers Art in the forming of a Flie, and write a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe thereof; one might, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, make, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb
<pb facs="tcp:51993:11"/>
ſaith, of a Flie an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephant; for Nature is moſt Artificious and admirable in her least productions, ſhewing moſt myſtery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, Wherefore the wiſeſt of men, King <hi>Solomon,</hi> that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of Trees from the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar of <hi>Libanon</hi> to the Iſop growing by the way ſide; that ſpoke of Beaſts and Birds, Reptils and Fiſhes; hath of none almoſt left us any do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but of the little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Gnats; the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of good houſe keeping con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the diligence and forecaſt, that is to be ſeen in

theſe poor little creatures; for having neither Prince Leader, nor Lord, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide their Bread in Summer, and gather their food in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt. If any could intrude into their habitation, be would be astoniſhed to ſee how orderly their domicill is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and fortified. Who can ſufficiently dive into the nature of the Bee? which hath given many matter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to write of. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient could not too much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the proſit thereof, which they expreſſed by this queſtion and Enigme: what is leſſer
<pb facs="tcp:51993:12"/>
then a Mouſe, bigher then a Houſe, and more profitable than a Country mans Ox? a Bee. Who can ſufficiently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire that Master piece of Nature, the Spider? that not only can ſo well according to the rules of Geometry, ſpin and tye its Web to a Poſt, or the branch of a Tree; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo can faſten it in the air, where there is no Baſis. Thus it hath pleaſed God to ſhew his power in infirmity, and depoſe the Treaſure of his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and omnipotence in the leaſt and meanesi beings.</p>
            <p>Having undertaken to
<pb facs="tcp:51993:12"/>
write of <hi>Ultima Thule,</hi> which is a poor little Land, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of other Countrys and Provinces: I found God had not omitted to diſtribute there ſome ſigns of his Almighty power, in ſeveral things that all may wonder at, which hath cauſed me to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them to others in this Treatiſe, and thereby grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the curious Reader. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeek far abroad the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works of God, either by reading or travelling in forreign and remote parts; whereas we have them as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable amongſt us, if they
<pb facs="tcp:51993:13"/>
were right conſidered; but as we care not for what we dayly ſee, we think it therefore not worthy to be Communicated to others, who would nevertheleſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem it rare and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Whence it is come, that none of thoſe that have been before me in <hi>Feroe,</hi> hath taken the pains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to leave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in writing of the Quality and Constitution of that Country.

I would not live I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, without the examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and conſidering thereof, endeavouring to doe my Countrymen, that are not informed of this Lands Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſome ſmall ſervice, by the Notification of what I have diſcovered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I pray therefore, and deſire the <hi>Courteous Reader</hi> to take in good part this my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, which I have deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Common good; and if he find any thing imperfect, expound it in the beſt meaning, every one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his faults.

            <head type="sub">Of the Land of <hi>Feroe</hi> in it ſelf, and the Circumſtances thereof.</head>
            <p>THe Iſlands of <hi>Feroe</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are only ſome high rocks, ariſing out of the wild Sea, and covered with a portion of thin Earth. For <hi>Feroe</hi> doth conſiſt of many Iſlands that are high Hills, of hard ſtone, ſtrangely divided from each other, by deep and rapid ſtreams of water. And that the ſaid Hills or Mountains might be uſeful to mankind, and the Lords ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Name, in this latter age of the world, be prais'd by true Chriſtians, in the midſt of the ſtorming Sea; it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Divine Providence to cover the valley between the Mountains, and the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51993:17"/>
ſides of the Hills, almoſt every where, with two foot thick of Earth; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where thicker or thinner, according to the nature of the place; whence doth grow, not only abundance of Graſs for Cattel, but alſo Corn for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of man. Wherefore if the land, as other even Countreys, could be cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated and inhabited; many thouſands of men, proportionably to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and number of the Iſlands, might there live and ſubſiſt. But the people dwell only by the Sea-ſide; where it is loweſt and moſt convenient for them to get to Sea with their Boats, and ply their Fiſhing; there being almoſt every where high promontories, whence no body can come down, nor get up; though there be ſome dangerous and terrible places, whence they alſo launch out their Boats to Sea, to go a Fiſhing; where they muſt have ſtrong Ropes in the Boat, that thoſe on Land may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times help the people out, if they are in any danger; ſome alſo, who are the moſt, live in creeks, inletts, and havens, that are many, convenient, and good for Seamen to lay in their Ships in time
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51993:17"/>
of danger. And where they live they have incloſed a ſmall piece of ground, which they Till to get Graſs and Corn; calling ſuch Cloſes, <hi>Boe;</hi> The other part without the incloſure, conſiſting in Valleys and Hills, and ſometimes in hills only, is a thouſand times larger, and is called <hi>Hawe,</hi> where their Sheep feed both Winter and Summer, and their Kine only in Summer; This part is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Tilled, neither can it be ſo, becauſe the Inhabitants live along the Sea ſide for their Fiſhing ſake, and other conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency, having nevertheleſs the full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thereof, for they keep there as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sheep as ever the place can feed.</p>
            <p>A part of the iſlands of <hi>Feroe</hi> is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, and a part furniſhed with Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel; they are in their greatneſs Havens, Creeks, Inletts, and other circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as followeth. <hi>Fugloe</hi> or Fowle-Iſland, which is the moſt North Eaſt, is pretty high and ſomething flat on the top, with high Clifts almoſt round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, three Engliſh miles long, and two broad, where it is broadeſt; having a little Creek on the Eaſt ſide, called <hi>Hatterviig;</hi> though it be unfit for Ships
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51993:18"/>
to Anchor in. <hi>Suinoe</hi> lyeth two miles ſouthward of <hi>Fugloe,</hi> conſiſting in two long and high Hills on the North and South ſide; The South Mountain is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Leage in length: the North but about half a League, there is a valley in the midſt; on the Eaſt ſide whereof the people do inhabit; and by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Iſland being ſeen ſomething far off at Sea, ſeems to be divided in two Iſlands. The ſaid valley is about a mile long from Eaſt to Weſt, and therefore the Inhabitants have Boats lying on the Eaſt and on the Weſt ſides, that they, according to the Wind, may ply their Fiſhing on either ſide ſuch Valleys (as alſo other places, where the paſſage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver land from one water to another is but ſhort) are called in the Language of <hi>Feroe, Eide,</hi> whereof there are many, to the great benefit of the Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Videcoe</hi> or <hi>Vidoe,</hi> lyes three miles weſt of <hi>Fugloe,</hi> and hath a mile from <hi>Suinoe,</hi> being crooked, and having alſo a Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley where the people dwell, it is in length about ſix miles, and where it is broadeſt about three miles; The
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51993:18"/>
ſouth end of it ſtretcheth it ſelf down between <hi>Suinoe</hi> and <hi>Bondoe,</hi> being full of high Hills, at the North of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley there is a high promontory, at the Eaſt there is a little Creek, though not very good ſor Ships to Anchor in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bordoe</hi> a ſtrange Iſland, being in its Figure like a Crab, having many points like claws; it lyeth South Weſt and Weſt of <hi>Videroe</hi> and <hi>Suinoe,</hi> being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from them by a ſmall <hi>Sinus</hi> in ſome places half a mile broad, there being a place near <hi>Qnandeſund</hi> only of Musket ſhot diſtant, on the North Eaſt and Eaſt ſide, it embraceth <hi>Videroe</hi> as with two arms, and thereby makes a ſafe harbour every where between both Lands, againſt all manner of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and current, having three entran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, one at North between <hi>Mulen</hi> and <hi>Videroe;</hi> another at South between <hi>Suinoe,</hi> and the moſt eaſterly eaſt point of <hi>Bordoe,</hi> and the third at eaſt between <hi>Suinoe.</hi> But ſince towards the South Eaſt, or South outlet, as alſo about the North Eaſt, or Eaſt, three points of Land ſtreatch out themſelves, the one from <hi>Videroe,</hi> the other from <hi>Bordoe,</hi> and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51993:19"/>
the third from <hi>Suinoe;</hi> and the ground under water being uneven, it makes an indifferent Whirle-pool, that turns the Boats that paſs over it round about; but Ships are in no danger of it. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the South Eaſt, <hi>Bordoe</hi> ſtretcheth it ſelf out into three branches or points, ſo that they ſeem at Sea as ſeveral I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands, and conſtitute too long Inletts, whereof that which is moſt Eaſtward is called <hi>Arnefiord,</hi> the other <hi>Baardevijgs,</hi> from <hi>Baardevijg's</hi> Inlet, there runs a little valley, half a mile long to the North weſt ſide, where there is a ſafe harbour called <hi>Klack.</hi> From hence the Land ſtretcheth it ſelf again to the North along <hi>Videroe</hi> a matter of ſix miles or leſs; all theſe branches and arms are for the moſt part ſtreightning on both ſides, into long and ſharp points, on the North Weſt <hi>Bordoe</hi> embraceth again with two arms or branches, another little Iſland called <hi>Kunoe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kunoe</hi> is a long and narrow Iſland a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſix miles in length, and a good mile in breadth, growing ſharp on both ſides, conſiſting in a long ſharp hill ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51993:19"/>
from <hi>Bordoe</hi> by a narrow ſtraight, in ſome places half a mile broad, and in ſome others leſs; ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf moſt to the South and North, from <hi>Mule</hi> on <hi>Bordoe,</hi> till the Harbour of <hi>Klack,</hi> which it ſhuts up with its ſoutherly end, and renders it ſafe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Currents of the Sea.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Oſteroe</hi> lyeth Weſt of <hi>Kalſoe</hi> and <hi>Bordoe,</hi> ſtretching it ſelf moſt North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward towards Eaſt, it is almoſt twenty miles long, but inequally broad, for ſome places are two miles broad, others four or ſix miles broad, according as the points ſtretch themſelves far out;

the Land conſiſting in many long bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or arms; on the Eaſt ſide towards <hi>Kalſoe, Bordoe,</hi> and the main Sea, it hath ſix long branches or arms, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute five Inlets or Creeks, namely, <hi>Funding fiord, And<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Oſteroe</hi> or <hi>Oſtres,</hi> extending it ſelf moſt N. W. to N. and S. E to S. it is 4 miles long, and a mile and half broad, where broadeſt, having on its weſt ſide <hi>Stromoe,</hi> at the diſtance of two miles and half<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is almoſt on the midſt of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland a high Hill ſloaping by little and little to the South ſide, where the Iſland is even on the top, and not very high; North of the Hill there is a little plain, and Weſt of it towards <hi>Stromoe</hi> a little Harbour called <hi>Nolſoeviig,</hi> an indifferent good Summer Harbour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stromoe</hi> is the largeſt Iſland in <hi>Feroe,</hi> and 24 miles long, and where it is broadeſt eight miles in breadth, it lyeth Weſt of <hi>Oſteroe</hi> and <hi>Nelſoe,</hi> ſtretching it ſelf North weſt to North, and South Weſt to South, being full of many high Hills, amongſt which <hi>Skelingsfels</hi> over goeth all the reſt in height, ſtanding like a high houſe above the others; it is very notable for Seamen that are bound for <hi>Thorſhaven,</hi> for when they get ſight of it, and ſail there unto, they fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Northern entrance of <hi>Thorſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> That Iſland hath alſo ſeveral Creeks and Harbours on the Eaſt ſide,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51993:21"/>

               </hi> between <hi>Baarn</hi> and <hi>Skadlehoffoed;</hi> afterwards there is <hi>Kalbacksfford,</hi> then <hi>Kollefiord;</hi> next thereunto <hi>Thorſviig,</hi> and <hi>Qualviig,</hi> one cannot come further with Ships, for on the North of <hi>Qualviig, Stromoe</hi> and <hi>Oſteroe,</hi> are as it were bound together by a ground that is between the Iſlands, over which runs a very rapid ſtream, and there is no Current on either ſide of the ground. From this ſtream it is that <hi>Stromoe</hi> is ſo called; at North of <hi>Stromoe</hi> is <hi>Halderſviig,</hi> an indifferent Harbour, into which one enters on the North ſide; on the north ſide there is a very fair Harbour called <hi>Weſtmans Haven,</hi> which is ſheltered by <hi>Waagoe</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Waagoe</hi> lyeth Weſt of <hi>Stromoe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divided from it by a ſtraight cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Weſtmans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>haven ſeund,</hi> a mile and a half broad, thorough which there is a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51993:21"/>
ſafe paſſage. The Land of <hi>Waagoe</hi> is almoſt of a Triangular or Quadrangular Figure, being eight miles in Diameter, it is cut in by two long Creeks, firſt by one on the South Eaſt ſide, called <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaage</hi> a good Summer Harbour, then at Weſt there is another Creek called <hi>Sorvaage.</hi> The Land it ſelf is all full of Hills; hard by the South point of <hi>Sorvaage,</hi> there lyes two little Iſlands with high clifts on them, called <hi>Tineholm</hi> and <hi>Gaaſeholm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Myggeneſs</hi> lyeth out at the Weſt of <hi>Sorvaage</hi> two miles from the Land, it is three miles long, and one and a half broad, having a high territory with high promontories round about it, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but one place to come on Land, it ſtretcheth it ſelf moſt to the North Eaſt and South Weſt. Towards the South Weſt end of it lyeth <hi>Myggeneſs</hi> Iſle, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a high clift round about, it is flat above, though ſloaping like the roof of a houſe on the North Eaſt ſide; it is ſeparated by a little Riff three or four furlongs broad.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kolter</hi> lyeth three miles to the South-Eaſt of <hi>Waagoe,</hi> and above two miles to the Weſt of <hi>Stromoe,</hi> it is a little I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51993:22"/>
a mile long, and about half a mile broad, ſtretching it ſelf moſt to the South and North, having a high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain at the North end, but at the South end it is low and narrow, having a high Promontory on the Weſt ſide.</p>
            <p>Eighteen years ſince in the middeſt of Summer, there was found on the higheſt top of the Mountain of <hi>Kolter,</hi> the quantity of many tomies of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings ſpread along; The Mountain where the Herrings were found is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two hundred fathoms high.</p>
            <p>The vulgar ſort will perhaps ask how theſe Herrings could come there? whereunto is anſwered, that they are carried thither by a whirlewind for the Sea it ſelf when it is moſt boiſterous, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome caſts any Fiſh on Land, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Seaward from the bottom; for as little as ſtrong wind can hinder the flight of Birds, as little can the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt motion of the Sea hinder the ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Fiſhes; but if either wind or water grow too ſtrong for their inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, as Birds hide themſelves in trees, holes, and neſts; ſo the ſmall Fiſhes that lie under the Land float on the deep to ſave themſelves there, as long
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51993:22"/>
as the ſtorm laſts, as is frequently ſeen in <hi>Feroe.</hi> Wherefore thoſe Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings were carryed there on Land by a kind of Whirle wind called <hi>Typhon,</hi> which in the Daniſh Tongue is named <hi>Oes.</hi> That ſort of Whirlewind is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med amongſt the Clouds, and ſtrikes from thence on the Sea and Earth with ſuch a ſudden and mighty whirle, that if it falleth on Land it takes up Trees, Buſhes, Stones, Fleſh, and what elſe it meets with; and where buildings are too great, it ſtrikes them down and breaks them to pieces. If it falleth on the Sea it takes up an incredible quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of water, ſo that one may ſee deep Cavities in the Sea till the water runs together again, and what Fiſhes are then in that water are drawn up by ſuch a whirlewind. Marriners that have tryed the dangers of the deep, can ſpeak enough of this whirlewind, and have firſt given it the name of <hi>Oes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it draws up the water of the Sea; Expert Seamen, when they are aware of it, let preſently fall all their Sails, or elſe they would loſe them, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times come in great danger of their lives.

            <p>It is related by a part of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, that North of the Land, there hath at ſeveral times appeared a Float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iſland; not only by the relation of our Predeceſſours, but alſo by that of thoſe that yet live, who verily relate that they have ſeen it during ſome hours, diſcerning hills and dales on it, and running Rivers flowing through the Valleys, and could perſpicuouſly fee that it was green in the Valleys be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p>Laſt year the 28 of <hi>April,</hi> 1671, came to <hi>Feroe,</hi> a Skipper, <hi>Paul Badſted,</hi> with his Ship, and both he and two young Prieſts which he brought over with him to <hi>Feroe,</hi> namely, Mr. <hi>Gregory Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Peter Clementſon,</hi> relate, that they on their voyage to <hi>Feroe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by ſtorm driven out of their courſe to the ſouth thereof, perceived an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland, and being come neer to it, ſaw it perfectly, with the Hills, Promontories, and Rivers thereof running down the Iſland, green with Graſs towards the ſea ſide, with Rocks and Clifts neer the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51993:26"/>
Land, not unlike in all Circumſtances to the Iſlands of <hi>Feroe,</hi> but perceiving no other Iſlands by it, they found themſelves to be deceived, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made to the North, and after ſome ſailing, found the Iſlands of <hi>Feroe,</hi> and the Maſter related, that, according to his conjecture they had found that Land eleven Leagues from <hi>Feroe,</hi> at ſouth eaſt. If there had been any ſteady Iſland in that place, it would have been found longago, thoſe that ſail to this Iſland often ſailing by that place, and all Ships that come from the South, and will go to the North of <hi>He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Iſland of <hi>Enckhupſon</hi> found, and ſo named by the Hollanders, which lay under the 65 degree of Northern Latitude, 45 Leagues North VVeſt of <hi>Feroe,</hi> ſeems to confirm that opinion, ſince it is no more to be found, I leave herein every one in his own opinion, whether ſuch a maſs of hard Rocks
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51993:26"/>
could Float, and now again ſink: If it were of the nature of a Pumill Stone, it might very well do ſo, but then it would ever Float; as Floating Iſlands in freſh water, that are grown toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with roots, and covered with a little looſe Eearth, deckt with graſs.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants beſides, rehearſe a Fable of <hi>Suinoe,</hi> that it was at firſt a Floating Iſland, and believe that if one could come to the Iſland ſo often ſeen, and caſt Steel thereon, it would remain faſt, which agreeth with the ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Duckers or Divers, that lay Steel upon what they find at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Sea, that Spirits may not remove it when they are hoyſed up, which otherwiſe they find to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Many alſo tell much of theſe Floating Iſlands, and believe there are ſuch in Nature; but I cannot give faith to any of them, nor to any ones ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition. If this were not deſcribed by the proprieties of many Iſlands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I would ſay it were a Mountain of ſee, that came Floating from <hi>Greenland,</hi> which if it be not, I believe ſtedfaſtly it is ſome deception or illuſion of the Devil,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51993:27"/>
who is in himſelf a thouſand fold Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicer; for he hath often before deluded them in many other manners, it being almoſt every mans talk in the Land, how formerly Satan in the dark, when they were riſen early in the morning in Winter, as they yet always do, to go a Fiſhing, did appear to them in the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a Boat, with Fiſhermen and all inſtruments belonging to Fiſhing; did ſpeak with them, gave them Fiſh baits, and told them where there was good Fiſhing to be found, and many can yet relate Satans words, when he diſcover'd them where there was good ground for Fiſhing. If Satan could then in the Figure of a Boat delude the Inhabitants, he may alſo do it now in the Figure of an Iſland, poſſibly to allure the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the unbelievers to him, and bring them into miſchief.</p>
            <p>This Province of <hi>Feroe;</hi> with the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands belonging to it above named, ſtretcheth it ſelf in its greateſt length, from North to South 60 miles, and in breadth 40 miles, or a little above, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at Eaſt <hi>Stat</hi> in <hi>Norway,</hi> at South Eaſt <hi>Orkeney</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> at South

            </p>
            <p>The height of the Pole or Latitude of <hi>Feroe,</hi> according to the ſupputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all, is at the South end 61 degrees 15 m. and at the North end 62 degrees 10 m. though I have found the Land (according to the height of <hi>Thors</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at 62 degrees 2 m. which I have ſeveral times taken) to lye ſomething more Northwards; I have as much as poſſible, ſought the Longitude, and have found the length from the Meridian of <hi>Euraniburgh</hi> 20 degrees 20 min. which makes one hour 21 min. ſo that the Longitude of <hi>Thors</hi> Haven is 16 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees 20 min. reckoning from the <hi>Pico</hi> of <hi>Teneriffe</hi> in the Canary Iſlands, if I can diſcover it better in time, I ſhall notifie it where it will be convenient. And ſince the Land lyeth under 62 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, there is but little night in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, not fully 5 hours; When the Sun is in the Sign of Cancer there is no night perceived for a whole month, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Sun doth not go 18 degrees under the Horizon, whence it comes, that in the middeſt of VVinter they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51993:28"/>
have but little day, though the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſculum</hi> and <hi>Diluculum</hi> are ſomething more longer here then elſewhere, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the Sun is in the South or Northerly Signs, for when it is at high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and makes the longeſt day after 62 degrees Latitude, it riſeth at 2 of the Clock and 7 minutes, and goeth down at 9 of the clock and 53 m. and then the day is 19 hours and 46 min. long, and the night from Sun-ſetting untill it riſeth 4 hours and 14 minutes, during which time there is no difference to be perceived between day and night, the Sun being then but 4 degrees 29 min. under the Horizon, and cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make any difference for a whole month, there being then alſo but little difference in the Suns declination, whence it comes that we have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable might untill the 17th. of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> when the Sun firſt comes 18 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees under the Horizon, which is its right depth, ſo that one can perceive nothing of its ſplendour. Now the Sun riſing in the mid'ſt of VVinter at 9 of the Clock 53 min. and ſetting at 2 a Clock and 7 m. and there being
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51993:28"/>
therefore but 4 hours and 14 minutes of day. The <hi>Crepuſculum</hi> and <hi>Dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum</hi> add much to its length, ſince one can perceive ſomething of the day in the mid'ſt of VVinter at 8 a clock in the morning, and at 4 a clock at night, whence it comes that they have not in <hi>Feroe</hi> ſuch tedious long nights, as one might well imagine.</p>
            <p>Theſe Iſlands of <hi>Feroe</hi> conſiſting of a hard Stone, there is found here and there a Loadſtone therein, on which if one ſetteth a Compaſs it will vary very much in ſome places to the Eaſt, and in ſome other to the VVeſt. At the South of <hi>Suderoe</hi> there is a whirle pool in the midſt whereof ſtands a high Rock called <hi>Sumboe Munk</hi> neer that Rock there are ſix others that riſe a little above the water; on which when one ſetteth the Compaſs, it turneth round, and is ſo ſpoiled, that it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards of no uſe, for ſome years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, there came a Ship too near this <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boe Munk</hi> whereupon all the Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that were in the Ship (as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter related afterwards to the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Suderoe)</hi> were ſpoiled, and his
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51993:29"/>
Voyage had been ſo too, had not a Seaman of the Ship by chance had a Loadſtone, wherewith he touched the Compaſſes anew. The ordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the Loadſtone on <hi>Feroe</hi> is otherwiſe, 13 degrees 19 minutes, to the North VVeſt, which <hi>Severin Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> formerly chief Marchant on <hi>Feroe,</hi> a Burger of <hi>Copenhagen</hi> very expert in the Art of Navigation, did mark and reckon out in the year 1659 the 26 of <hi>December,</hi> at <hi>Thors</hi> Haven, on <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since we have deſcribed the Land of <hi>Feroe,</hi> eſpecially ſo, that honeſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners may the better know the Land Marks; we will alſo here comprehend ſomething of the Streams. Between theſe ſeveral divided Iſlands there run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth many ſtrong Currents in ſeveral manners, according as the necks or points of Land meet againſt the ſtreams, and according to the ſcituation of the ſaid land, which cauſeth ſpecially in VVinter when there is a ſtorm, and the wind bloweth againſt Tide, a terrible and turbulent Sea, principally where there is ground neer the ſurface of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51993:29"/>
water; for where thoſe grounds ſtretch themſelves towards the Land, the Sea raiſeth it ſelf and tumbleth about againſt it, ſo that it is terrible to conſider, yea it breaketh ſo ſtrengly againſt the Land that ſcarce any Ship where it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently deep, can get over them, which grounds with breaking waves are called in the Language of <hi>Feroe, Boffves.</hi> If there comes any Boats on theſe <hi>Boff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,</hi> when they break, it is preſently ſunk, with men and all.</p>
            <p>It happened for 16 years ago, that Mr. <hi>John Hanſon Hardy,</hi> Curate of <hi>Suderoe,</hi> on his Voyage to <hi>Thors</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (in a Sex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing, that is a great Boat rowed by twelve men) came on ſuch a <hi>Boffve</hi> in pretty good weather, yet both he and his wife, and all his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, with other of his Folks, to the number of 21 ſouls, were all drowned, And the Boat ſunk by the <hi>Boffve;</hi> It happened in that ſad accident that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe drowned Folks, the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates VVife floated up again eight days after, and was found driving in the Current, whereof doubtleſs the cauſe is, that ſhe had greater veins then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51993:30"/>
as is uſual for women to have, by the blowing up of which her Corps was brought a Float.</p>
            <p>It is very obſervable, that when the ſaid <hi>Boffve</hi> breaketh in bad weather, it doth ſo three or ſeven times together, without ceaſing, and then reſteth ſome time, therefore when the Inhabitants come to ſuch a <hi>Boffve,</hi> and muſt needs over it, they lye ſtill untill the <hi>Boffve</hi> hath broken, and then get over it ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily with their Boat.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the <hi>Boffve</hi> breaks alſo in ſtill weather, when it is very warm, and when there will be Froſt or Snow. Thirdly, when ſome Boat goeth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing near the land over the <hi>Boffve</hi> that breaks not then, but lyeth ſtill, it break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up unawares of it ſelf, and often bringeth people in danger. I have been told by an old honeſt man yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, very expert from his youth both in Currents and <hi>Boffves,</hi> who knew all the <hi>Boffves</hi> round about the Countrey where he lived, that it happened ſome years ſince, he went with a Boat from the Land, whereon he dwelt, namely, <hi>Kol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> over to <hi>Stromoe,</hi> to ſet there a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51993:30"/>
man on land, and went into a little Creek of the length of a Boat, and half ſo broad, where he ſet the man on ſhoar, it being then quiet and ſtill all about, when againſt all expectation, a <hi>Boffve</hi> broke upon him, ſo that he and all his folks were in very great danger of their lives; having never from his youth, nor ſince that time perceived any <hi>Boff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve</hi> to be there.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants are in this ſimple o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that the Sea is ſenſible, and that the <hi>Boffves</hi> cannot endure the Iron of the Boat. But hereupon theſe are my reflections; that the <hi>Boffve</hi> breaks up a certain number of times happeneth by the providence of God, that hath created all things according to weight, meaſure, and number, but that the <hi>Boff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves</hi> break either againſt warm weather, or againſt a North wind and Snow, or a ſo when ſome Boat goeth over the ſame muſt have an occult cauſe, which is hard to be found out; and that one may the better underſtand the cauſe of it, one muſt conſider, that there is this order in nature.</p>
            <p>All motion that happeneth between
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51993:31"/>
the Elements and other beings, that have neither ſenſe nor life, doth happen by a Magoetical Sympathy or Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; that is a hidden and inward affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in ſenſeleſs beings, whereby ſome things love eath other, and are eaſily united together; ſome hate one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and cannot be united, whereby there is made a motion in nature, as if there were ſome life in the things which move themſelves, or ſuffer themſelves to be moved. This is perfectly ſeen in the Loadſtone, which by Sympathy loveth Iron, and turneth it ſelf towards it. This is manifeſt enough amongſt Medicaments, and ſpecially it is ſeen and perceived in Antidotes, that is Medicines againſt poyſon, and in the poiſons themſelves; for when a man hath taken ſome poiſon, and thereupon taketh in an Antidote, the poiſon is then driven out by the Antidote.</p>
            <p>Chymiſts do find the ſame amongſt Mettals and Minerals, for Gold hateth Brimſtone, driving it away, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe loveth Salt, drawing the ſame to it ſelf, being eaſily united with it in Operations; Silver on the contrary ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51993:31"/>
ſalt, drives it away, and inſtead thereof loveth Brimſtone.</p>
            <p>There is a natural Sympathy and Antipathy between the Elements, and is even ſo as we have now expreſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mettals and Minerals; for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Circle divided in 4 parts, with A.

Salt D. who as their reſpective Enemies ſtand op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the Figure; ſo the Earth A. cannot abide the air C. nor the water B. the Fire D. which therefore ſtand alſo over againſt one another in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and yet they are bound together by an orderly Sympathy, for air it ſelf cannot be ſhut up within the Earth, and if it happeneth ſo, it doth not tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long in that Lodging, but breaketh out with great force, and cauſeth thoſe terrible Earth quakes; neither can the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51993:32"/>
Earth remain above in the air, but ſtayeth in its proper Seat, and if the Sun draweth any thing from it into the air, that groſs unpoliſhed gueſt knoweth not how to behave himſelf in that ſubtile habitation, neither can the Air well abide it, and therefore there ariſeth a quarrel between them, with terrible Thunder and Lightning; In the ſame manner Fire cannot be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited with Water, without one of the parties deſtruction, as is known to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding that the Elements are in their nature ſo contrary to one another, nevertheleſe the one will not, nor can be without the other, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other by a temperature, but when that is wanting, ſo that there be either exceſs or defect, nature then ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth, and is moved by Antipathy, by which reaſon, this unexpected mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth happen in the water o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thoſe grounds that are called <hi>Boff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For it is ſeen in <hi>Feroe,</hi> when the Air is very warm, ſo that there ariſeth a Fog from the Sea, rendring the Air
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51993:33"/>
dusky, that not only the Currents run a great deal ſwifter and ſtronger then at other times, but the Sea alſo grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſtormy, beating againſt the Land, and the <hi>Boffves</hi> break out though it be ſtill weather; which happeneth becauſe of the Antipathy that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Water and warmth in its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, whereby Water ſuffereth in its nature.</p>
            <p>Quite contrary, this happeneth alſo when there will come a ſtrong Froſt and Snow in Winter: the Currents grow then ſtronger, The Sea beats, the <hi>Boffves</hi> ariſe, though it be very ſtill weather, becauſe there happeneth a deficiency in the temperature of warmth, water being forced to loſe a part of its natural heat, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot keep its innate fluiddity, but muſt, by ſuffering in its nature, let it ſelf be chang'd to a ſtanding ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid matter, namely Ice, which affect the Elements, do perceive afore hand, and by the vertue of their Magnettical Antipathy, move themſelves.</p>
            <p>This Motion is alſo perceived in hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for it happeneth in <hi>Feroe,</hi> that when
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51993:33"/>
there is a great ſtorm, and the wind cannot have its paſſage between thoſe many hills, as in plain ground, that it is ſometimes quite ſtill in the Valleys; ſo that one may go with a light between the houſes; and on the contrary the gathered wind comes afterwards a great deal ſtronger and more terrible, but before ſuch weather cometh, or that one can perceive any thing of it, as the water ariſeth before the coming of a hard Froſt, ſo are the houſes moved before this ſtormy weather cometh, ſo that every nail of the houſe cracks, though the houſes be ſcarce moved af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when the ſtorm beats upon them, they being low and Fortified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with thick walls of Turffs and Stones, which motion muſt therefore neceſſarily happen in the manner afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
            <p>But that the <hi>Boffves</hi> break when there comes a Boat over them, hath a far more hidden cauſe, though it may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by the aforeſaid Magnettical Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy. We have declared above how it is with the Loadſtone in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, on the Rocks near <hi>Sumboe Munk</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:51993:34"/>
and I doubt not but there being ſo ſtrong a Magnet in thoſe Rocks that are ſo little above the water, there may alſo be a Magnet in ſuch grounds, whence it comes, that when a Boat paſſeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, the Loadſtone by its Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, attracts the Iron of the Boat, which that ſhallow water not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to endure, riſeth it ſelf, though I leave herein every one to his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Current of the ſtream it runneth very ſwiſtly about the points of Land, eſpecially in the new and full Moon, eight men in a Boat not being able to overcome it, but muſt ſtay till it hath run out, and turneth it ſelf by reaſon of which it happeneth often, that when the poor Inhabitants are at Sea about their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, and there cometh an unexpected ſtorm, the ſtream being againſt them, they muſt ſtay on the ſame place, at all adventure, untill the turning of the ſtream, and till they get the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent with them towards the Land; but if the ſtorm groweth too ſtrong, thoſe poor people often come to misfortunes.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51993:34"/>
It cannot be well expreſt with a pen, how fierce the Sea is, nor to what height it raiſeth it ſelf, when the wind and the ſtream are againſt one another. And it is obſervable as is ſaid above, that when the Current runneth againſt the wind, the wind bloweth with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er force then it doth elſe, and when the ſtream runneth before the wind, it ſtilleth it ſelf, ſo that they ſeem at firſt to ſtrive againſt each other, as two enemies, and afterwards to grow mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er when one of them doth fly. I muſt here relate an Example of the Sea's ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribleneſs by the reaſon aforeſaid. The little Iſland <hi>Kolter,</hi> which is deſcribed above, is expoſed to the open Sea on the weſt ſide, and there is towards the Main a Promontory thirty Fathoms high, where the Sea almoſt every win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter breaks over with a Weſtern wind, and that in ſuch quantity, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants are ſometimes in danger, though the Sea has yet 50 Fathoms to run without the Clifts, before it reacheth the Land.</p>
            <p>It happened for ſome years ago, that there lay a large ſtone ſix foot long and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51993:35"/>
four foot thick and broad, on a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the ſaid Promontory, which ſtone the proud Sea tumbled about and threw ſome paces from the place where it lay before; that ſeems incredible, if one conſiders the bigneſs of the ſtone, and the height of the Mountain, and one might well ſay how is it poſſible that the Sea can riſe fifty Ells up in the Air, but it is nevertheleſs a perfect truth, for it hath not only been rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me by the Countrymen of the Iſland, but it lying in my Pariſh, I have my ſelf been there, and exactly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the place; and he that takes good notice of it, may rather won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, then conceive how it can be ſo.</p>
            <p>The Fiſhers ſay alſo that when there hath been ſome days ſuch a ſtrange ſtorm of water and wind, and the wind afterwards ſtilleth it ſelf; ſo that the Inhabitants dare row out on Fiſhing. There is nevertheleſs an extraordinary great motion every where at Sea; ſo that ſometimes they are as it were, lifted up to the Heaven, and preſently come down as it were, to the Abyſſm
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51993:35"/>
as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127. which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sea they call <hi>Alda,</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie, that when they are ſunk in it, they can ſee no land, though it be above 300 Fathoms high.</p>
            <p>As for the motion of Tides themſelves they perfect their courſe according to the Moon here as well as in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where there are ordinary tides, by an ebb of ſix hours, and a Flood of the like ſpace of time</p>
            <p>Yet their courſe is different according as they beat againſt the Rocks and points of Land, and as the ground is under them; whence it comes that the particular ſtreams alter their courſe, and run directly againſt the general Tides, ſuch ſtreams being called here <hi>Ider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the general Currents here, the Seaman that is not much acquainted with the Land may have this for information.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, where the ſtreams run even between the land, there is a principal Current; as between <hi>Sude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roefiord, Staapenfiord, Kalſoefierd, Skuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiord</hi> and <hi>Fugloefiord.</hi> When the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51993:36"/>
runneth here to the Weſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is called Weſt-fall, and when it runneth to the Eaſt, Eaſt-fall; but in <hi>Kalſoefiord</hi> the Eaſt-fall runneth Northward, and the Weſt-fall Southward, becauſe of the points of Land.</p>
            <p>Secondly it doth not run with equall rapidity during the ſix hours, but its courſe can be divided into three parts; In the firſt third part it runneth prerty faſt, changing and augmenting its force more and more. In the ſecond, third part, it is very rapid, and is here called <hi>Braaddew;</hi> In the laſt third part it lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth its force by little and little, till it comes to turn, and then the ſtream is as it were half dead. In the third place, the Tide is not allways equally ſtrong, but it is ſtrongeſt in the new and full Moon, three days before and three days after, loſing after of its force till the firſt and laſt quarter, and it renews its ſtrength again from the firſt and laſt quarter, till the new and full Moon, though according to the Moons ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue it be neither always equally ſtrong, but in the Spring and Summer when the Sun acteth moſt on the earth, ſo that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51993:36"/>
the warmth reflecteth thence, and in the Dog days, when the air is hotteſt, by reaſon of the heat of the Canicule, it is ſtronger in every change of the Moon, then it uſeth to be in Autum or Winter; from which effect may doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs be concluded, that the Sun, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Moon, and the inward warmth of the Earth doth produce the motion of the Tides.</p>
            <p>For the 4<hi>th.</hi> when the ſtream runneth in the Inlets at E. or when it is Eaſt-fall, it is then Weſt-fall by the land, and in the Iders, and ſo quite contrary, ſo that when the Maſter of a Ship cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his voyage in the middle of the Inlets, he muſt ſeek his advantage by the Iders, for they ſtretch themſelves in ſome places a mile from the Land.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, the Tide beginneth, that is, the water riſeth at Weſt fall, and when that is out, and it is <hi>Braaddew,</hi> it is Floud or higheſt water, that is Weſt-fall in all the principal ſtreams of every Inlet, but afterwards cometh the Eaſt-fall from the Land, beginning thereby by little and little to grow low water, but how high or low the water riſeth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51993:37"/>
or falleth in <hi>Feroe,</hi> cannot be exactly deſcribed, there being a great ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quallity in it, both by reaſon of the changes of the ſeaſons of the year, and of the Moon, wherein the ſtreams are ſtrongeſt; Notwithſtanding the ſtream ariſeth much higher at weſt of the Land then at Eaſt, uſually ſeven Fathoms at Weſt, and but three at Eaſt.</p>
            <p>In the ſixth place it is very needful for a Pilot to know when it is high wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Weſt-fall in <hi>Feroe,</hi> not that he might thereby run ſecurely over Rocks and grounds; for he hath no great need of that in <hi>Feroe,</hi> but that he may know how the ſtream runneth, and advance his voyage accordingly; all Marriners having erred therein till this day, even the Sea expert Hollanders, who in their Sea Mirrour, write that a South and North Moon maketh higheſt water in <hi>Feroe.</hi> Thoſe that have traded in this Country and in their Voyage have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of the Tides, have found it otherwiſe, and believe quite contrary, that an Eaſt and Weſt Moon giveth higheſt water; wherein they doe not much erre, but I have enquired about
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51993:37"/>
this buſineſs of old underſtanding men, who nevertheleſs take little notice of higheſt water, nor know wherefore it is ſo obſervable; but only note their Weſt and Eaſt fall, which they never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs only mark by Flood and low water, not underſtanding what an Eaſt or Weſt Moon ſignifieth, and they ſay altogether, that the ſecond day after New or Full Moon, it is perfect Weſt-fall, that is higheſt water at ſix of the Clock in the morning, and Eaſt-fall or Low-water at twelve of the Clock at Noon; whence an expert man can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that a North Eaſt Moon, and a South Weſt, make higheſt water, the firſt day the Moon beginneth to fill, that is at five a Clock and fifteen mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes in the morning, and then they have higheſt water, or Weſt fall, in new or full Moon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in <hi>Feroe,</hi> a North Eaſt and a South Weſt Moon making high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt water in all the principal Streams above mentioned. In the other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Streams, it is high water at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent hours, in ſome before, and in ſome after the ordinary time; for in <hi>Leerviigs-fiord,</hi> an Eaſt North Eaſt, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51993:38"/>
Weſt South Weſt Moon maketh high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt water, that is, when it is four a Clock and a half in the Morning; In <hi>Nolſoe fiord</hi> an North Eaſt and South Weſt Moon, that is at three a Clock, and in <hi>Weſtmans haven</hi> and <hi>Myggeneſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiorda</hi> North Weſt and South Eaſt Moon, that is at nine a Clock in the forenoon, ſo that here is a ſtrange difference in the riſing of the water, between theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Iſlands, which cometh altogether by reaſon of the points of Land.</p>
            <p>I dare not undertake to explicate the ſeveral Streams, with their Iders, there being often in one Inlet five different Currents that run againſt one another; ſo that I verily believe if the Learned Philoſopher <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> were here him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to undertake that work, he would find no leſs difficulty therein, then in his Euripe. Nevertheleſs I cannot forbear writing ſomething of the little ſtream, between <hi>Stromoe</hi> and <hi>Oſteroe,</hi> which ſeemeth very ſtrange. Though that ſtream on both ſides of the water be wholly ſtill and dead, and there be a very ſhort way over the grounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both Lands, it runneth neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51993:38"/>
forward and backward, according to the ordinary Changes of the Moon, ſo ſwiftly, that it is impoſſible to row againſt it; but one muſt expect till it returneth. Whereof the cauſe is this; There goeth neither Ebb nor Tide at South of the ſtream, but at North the water riſeth and falleth, though there be no ſtream; therefore when the Tide comes, the water runneth over to the South Sinus, and when it falleth again, it runneth over the grounds from the South into the North, yet no ſtream can be perceived, becauſe the Inlet groweth wider on both ſides, and is deep in it ſelf, even as in the Main Sea. Before <hi>Feroe</hi> no ſtream is diſcerned, though there be ſome, as every where in the world, but when it comes to the Iſlands, the free ſlow courſe of it is hindered; and therefore it is forced by the narrow Streights between the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands, to thruſt it ſelf between the Lands, as a River would do through a Sluce.</p>
            <p>Beſides, theſe ſeveral Streams, there are alſo ſome other, that turn round about, which they call <hi>Male Stromme</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:51993:39"/>
or Whirle-pool, whereof there are many that have been known hitherto, and are of all eſteemed to be Sea-Abyſsms; which errour cometh, becauſe none could Sound their bottoms, by reaſon of the danger attending it, they draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to themſelves all that cometh near them, whirle it to the bottome, and after a certain time, caſt it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>There are in <hi>Feroe</hi> three ſuch Whirle-pools; the one between <hi>Videroe, Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe</hi> and <hi>Bordoe,</hi> not very dangerous, the other at South of <hi>Sandoe,</hi> by <hi>Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es</hi> Cliffts, called the <hi>Mill,</hi> dangerous when there is a ſtorm or a ſtrong ſtream. The third at South of <hi>Suderoe,</hi> running about <hi>Sumboe Munk,</hi> very dangerous. The cauſe of theſe Whirle pools is not that there is a bottomleſs Abyſm at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Sea, wherein the water ſhould run, when it is Ebb, and Flow out again when it is Tide; ſo that this ſhould cauſe Ebb and Flood, according to the opinion of ſome; for if it was ſo, it would not rage ſo much, the ſtilleſt water having the deepeſt bottome, but it proceeds from round grounds, with
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51993:39"/>
Channels or Conduits in them.</p>
            <p>I have dilligently inquired about theſe Whirle-pools, of the two De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties ſent with me from <hi>Feroe</hi> to <hi>Denmark</hi> humbly to repreſent the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral neceſſities of the Country, and one of them named <hi>John Jonaſon,</hi> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on <hi>Suderoe,</hi> told me that he had been the firſt that durſt undertake to row over the VVhirle pool, that lyeth South of <hi>Suderoe,</hi> about <hi>Sumboe Munk,</hi> whereof he ſpoke with certain and long experience</p>
            <p>Firſt, this Stream is very terrible and dangerous of it ſelf, eſpecially when there is a Storm and a ſtrong Current, it draweth to it ſelf all that comes too near it, and as it were ſwallows it up, ſo that a Ship cannot ſave her ſelf nor avoid it, if ſhe approacheth it too near. For a few years ago, the ſaid <hi>John Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> ſaw about <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Tide in Stormy weather, a great Ship come into that Stream, whereof he ſaw ſometimes the Fore-maſt, ſometimes the Mizen-maſt, and the Sea ſtrike above the Maine Quarter, a while after which, he could ſee nothing more of the Ship. The Sea
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51993:40"/>
expert <hi>Baggowandel,</hi> in his book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the VVatching Eye, makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this VVhirle pool, and ſaith, that Skipper <hi>Peter Odevald</hi> gave him knowledge of it, I remember the time that the ſaid <hi>Odevald</hi> got to know this Stream, for he and his Folks told me that his Ship was drawn into it before he was aware, and that he could not then Steer her, the water beating in on all ſides, to a great height of the Maſt, and he could not ſave himſelf with his Sailes, becauſe it was quite ſtill weather, the Maſter affirming that he was never before in ſuch peril and danger, though at laſt it pleaſed God to aſſiſt him, ſo that he came off again by the reflux of the Stream, and arrived ſafe to <hi>Thors-haven,</hi> whither he was bound.</p>
            <p>Secondly according to the ſaid <hi>John Jonaſons</hi> Relation, the ground round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this VVhirle-pool is eighty or ninety Fathom deep, over which ground the Stream goeth ſtill and quiet, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any boiſtering, afterwards round about the VVhirle-pool, the ground lyeth 25, 30, to 35 Fathoms deep, over
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51993:40"/>
which ground the Sea with its waves begins to lift it ſelf, to work hard, to draw, and to whirle about: afterwards there riſeth a third ground, which ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth eight, ten, to twelve Fathom deep, which formeth it ſelf Snaile wiſe in a Circle four times double. Nature hath made this high ground with points, as the tops of ſome Cliffts; whence it comes that upon the points there is only eight Fathoms deep of water, and between them ten or twelve Fathoms: wherefore when a Fiſher Boat comes upon that uneven round Bank, it is whirled about by the ſtream that turns round about theſe high Cliffts, and that with ſuch a ſwiftneſs, that young people unuſed to ſuch a whirle, muſt lay themſelves down in the Boat to avoid giddineſs of the head, and it is to be noted, that, beſides this ſwift and haſty Gyration, the Boat is turned about in another Circle, according to the Snail-wiſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the ground.</p>
            <p>In the third place, between theſe four round grounds, there are three
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51993:41"/>
Channels or Conduits, wherein the Sea worketh ſtill and runs about in the ſaid ſmall turnings; and before, on the Eaſt ſide, where the ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, there is a Gulf where the ſtream runs in, as through a Sluce; though within it worketh but ſoftly; Theſe Channels are 25, 30, to 35 Fathoms deep; now theſe Channels having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even bottoms, and the water flowing about in ſlow whirles, it ſeems, that the form of the bottom muſt be like that of the Superficie, that is to ſay, with ſmall bowings and Cavities in it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, in the mid'ſt of this VVhirle-pool, there is a deep hole, that is 50 or 55 Fathoms deep, neer the very bottome; in the middle thereof it is generally 61 Fathoms deep; the inward water is even and ſtill above, only it runs ſlowly in a Circle, which may eaſily be ſeen by the Seas Scum, falling out of the Whirle pool, that floweth round; on the South ſide of that hole ariſeth out of the water a Rock ten Fathoms high,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51993:41"/>
called <hi>Sumboe Munk</hi> about which there is but fifteen fathoms deepth. At North of <hi>Sumboe Munk,</hi> there are ſix leſſer Rocks, between which and the <hi>Munk</hi> there is the depth of three or four Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms. And it is to be noted, as is ſaid above, that on theſe Rocks the Compaſs runneth round about, even as the Whirle-pool it ſelf; whereby it is ſpoiled. So it is worth obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that on <hi>Sumboe Munk</hi> there is an extraordinary great cold, even in the hotteſt Sunſhine and beſt weather of Summer, ſo that the people that get up the <hi>Munk</hi> to take Fowle, can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endure the cold, beſides the Fowles that are hatcht and keep themſelves there, are very lean, ſo that there is nothing on them but the bare Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. I am in great doubt whence ſuch an extraordinary cold ſhould come; the water about <hi>Feroe,</hi> though it be cold in it ſelf, yet by reaſon of its faltneſs and perpetual motion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cauſing uſually there a temperate Winter; I cannot therefore conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture that this Streams continual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51993:42"/>
ſhould contrarywiſe cauſe ſuch an extraordinary cold on the <hi>Munk.</hi> One may conclude, that ſince there is ſo ſtrong a Magnete in the Center of the aforeſaid leſſer Rocks, there may be alſo a ſtrong Magnete in the other round grounds, by reaſon of whoſe vertue, beſides the Streams, Ships can ſo eaſily be brought into that danger. And if there be a Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal vertue therein, whereof I doubt not, I leave to others Judgment, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it can be the cauſe of that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary cold.</p>

and dangerous ſtirring there is in ſuch a Whirlepool, when there is a ſtrong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtorm and current: Since there is ſuch a motion of the Boats over it, when it is ſtill weather, a mild Sea, and the reflux of the ſtream, for then only Folkes venture themſelves to fiſh thereon.</p>
            <p>The Whirle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>pool under <hi>Sandoe</hi> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth about to its very middle point, and hath no depth in the mid'ſt, I have my ſelf been twice on the third Whirle-pool between the North I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands, and when one comes near it, it droweth the Boat to it ſelf, as if it would ſwallow it; ſo that the people have enough to doe to keep the ſtream from getting the upper hand, all thoſe of one ſide rowing ſtrongly againſt the Gulf with their Oares, whileſt all thoſe of the other ſide, with their Oares, row quite contrary. And if the ſtream gets the upper hand is whirles firſt twice about with the Boat and then twice back again, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo four or five times; whence it is eaſie to conclude how the ground is

            <p>Amongſt others <hi>Athan. Kircheny, l.</hi> 3. <hi>Hydrog.</hi> writes of the Renowned Whirle pool under <hi>Norway,</hi> called, <hi>Moske Strom,</hi> that it is a Sea Gulf, wherein the Sea runs down under the land of <hi>Norway,</hi> and runneth out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at another Sea Gulf within <hi>Sinus Bothnicus,</hi> or <hi>Botthen,</hi> whoſe opinion Mr. <hi>Herbinius</hi> in his publick diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion held at <hi>Copenhagen</hi> in the year 1670. doth follow, which opinion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grounded upon uncertain rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is very erroneous, as will be proved by the following reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all this Whirle-pool lyeth under the Land, between two Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories or Iſlands, where the bottom of the Sea ariſeth, and doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51993:46"/>
in deep cavities, even as is found in all the Whirle pools of <hi>Feroe,</hi> and in that of <hi>Botthen.</hi> In the like manner, the ſaid <hi>Kircherus</hi> in his <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bula Geographica Hydrographica,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes many Sea Gulfs through the whole world, but they are all found near the Continent, or between ſmall Iſlands; <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis</hi> are ſo in the <hi>Scicillian</hi> Sea, the one under <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilly,</hi> the other near the point of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labria,</hi> and to confirm the thing the more, <hi>Kircherus</hi> ſaith, that there ſtands a high Rock in the midſt of the ſtream which muſt be as the <hi>Munk</hi> in the mid'ſt of <hi>Sumboes</hi> Whirle pool de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed above.

            <p>Secondly, Mr. <hi>Peter Clauſon</hi> in his Deſcription of <hi>Norway</hi> writes, that the water runs about in ſuch turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and boiſterous manner, that one can hear it ſome Leagues off at Sea, which would not be if there were any
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51993:47"/>
deep ground to make a ſwallowing Gulf, ſince the ſtilleſt water hath the deepeſt bottom; but that great noiſe is made, firſt, becauſe it is a narrow and ſmall paſſage, between two Iſlands for the large Ocean to run through with the Tide to the Continent, and as narrow to fall back again into the Maine Sea; and beſides that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thoſe high grounds, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing winding in the manner of a Snail, reaſon doth perſwade that huge beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and running about muſt make a terrible noiſe.</p>
            <p>In the third place, Mr. <hi>Peter Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> aforeſaid, writes, that what whole Trees that ſtream draweth in, come out again <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ugged with torn Roots and Branches, which happeneth by reaſon that theſe high round, and ſharp grounds, between which the Trees are whirled about by the ſtrong ſtream, doth beat and wear off the Roots, Branches, Bark, and the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt of the Trunk thereof. Of which ſort of Trees there comes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aſhoar to <hi>Feroe,</hi> which would not
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51993:47"/>
happen if there were any pervious Gulf, for then the hole would be large; and the water run ſtill round about, and when any thing came to the Gulf, it would haſtily run through it without any damage, as one may plainly ſee, putting a piece of Wood in a Funnel, and fill the Funnel full of water, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kircherus,</hi> to ſtrengthen his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, writes, that near that high Rock in the midſt of the ſtream, there is an Abyſme, through which the Water is ſwallowed; in that manner there ſhould firſt be a <hi>Vortex</hi> or Whirle pool, and within it a <hi>Vor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>omes driving to <hi>Feroe,</hi> Iſland, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51993:48"/>
               <hi>Greenland;</hi> as is more then ſufficiently known. In the like manner what comes up again in <hi>Botthen,</hi> is driven by the ſtream to one of thoſe Sea Coaſts, or elſe out into the Eaſt Sea, and one ſhould then ſee many of thoſe Sea Wrecks in the Eaſt Sea, whereof nothing hath been yet perceived. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, it is openly known to all thoſe that have any ways frequented the Northern Countreys, that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants that dwell on the Iſlands and the Continent about <hi>Moskoe-Strome,</hi> row out upon the Whirle pool, when the weather is good, and the ſtream ſlow in its reflux, and fiſh there abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of fiſh called <hi>Sey,</hi> as I have been newly told by a Reverend man worthy of belief, very well known in that place.</p>
            <p>I confeſs nevertheleſs, that there may be a deep hole near that high Rock, which if there be, as I do not at all doubt, then <hi>Moskoe Strom</hi> doth agree in the ground perfectly with <hi>Sumboes</hi> Whirle-pool. And it is in truth an admirable work of Nature,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51993:48"/>
that as ſhe hath wonderfully formed the Shell of a Snaile, ſo ſhe forms the like figures in the air, for Whirl-winds, and in the ground for Whirl-pools, ſetting in the middeſt of ſuch whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pools, a token to be aware of danger, and that nature might not be a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to it ſelf, it hath made therein a receptacle or deep hole to receive and keep what the ſtream draweth in from time to time, and afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored it when it runs out again.</p>
            <p>Neither will the Gulf within <hi>Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> be found to be otherwiſe then a round ground, ſince there is alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch a terrible noiſe and boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering as <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, which comes from the rapid ebb and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51993:49"/>
is heard a terrible noiſe, which Mr. <hi>Herbinius</hi> affirms in his Diſſertation to have himſelf experimented, believing not before that ſuch things were in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>As Whirle pools have hitherto gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven much to think to many, ſo ſtreight Currents have not buſied the thoughts of a leſſer number, to explicate fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally their true cauſe, ground, and manner: and though they did invent ſome cauſes, they have not yet found the true Form and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell.</p>
            <p>My intention is not to ſet up my ſelf againſt ſuch eminent Philoſophers, but only to write down what I have experimented and diſcerned in nature; if I can thereby bring any light to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Hiſtory, I hope it will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe the Ingenious Reader.</p>
            <p>Firſt, here is ſet down the inward cauſe, namely, the ſecret Magnetick Sympathetical and Antipathetical ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, proved and explicated above, by which Nature worketh between the Elements, and bringeth them into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:51993:49"/>
Secondly, there are found two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther active external cauſes, the one is the inward warmth of the Earth; the other the heat of the Sun and Stars.</p>
            <p>The warmth of the Earth is not as ſome wrongfully think, a ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean fire; for then the Sea ſhould be moſt moved near <hi>Iſland, Italy,</hi> and <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s proved by this, that the Sea hath principally in the Spring, in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April;</hi> its chiefeſt motion and greateſt Ebb and Floud in <hi>Feroe;</hi> when warmth gets the upper hand, and the Earth open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelf for Plants to break out of it, which motion with its Ebb and Floud doth not come, as <hi>Carteſius</hi> ſuppoſeth, from the the Earths Conjunction with the Moon in the Collure of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. The Earth being removed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the Eqnator or the Line, and the Moon under the Ecliptick, meeting together in <hi>Aries</hi> and in <hi>Libra,</hi> where the Aequator divideth the Zodiack, and therefore the Sea and Stream are ſtrongeſt in the Spring and in Autumn. We will not enter here into the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about the motion of the Earth, but only ſay againſt it, that if it were ſo, the Flouds ſhould be greateſt, and the Streams moſt rapid both in the Spring and Autumn, as <hi>Corteſius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf affirmeth, though notwithſtanding Ebb and Floud is greateſt in the Spring and almoſt leaſt of all in Autumn, as is known to all the Inhabitants of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe,</hi> beſides which, it would alſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that in Summer, when the Moon and the Sun are in <hi>Cancer,</hi> or in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when they are in <hi>Capricorn,</hi> or in the Collure of the Solſticies, the floods ſhould be leaſt, and the ſtreams weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, whereas in the middeſt of Summer the Floud is found to be greateſt, and the ſtream almoſt ſtrongeſt, one may therefore reaſonably attribute it to the cauſe, which hath then moſt force,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51993:50"/>
namely, the warmth of Earth, which then aſcends, and produceth its ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
            <p>Reaſon might well perſwade it to be impoſſible, that ſuch a great and deep water ſhould be altered thereby; ſuch a warmth being very moderate, my reaſon would alſo dictate to me the ſame, if the Magnetical Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy whereby this warmth is ſo qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified in the Water, were not in nature. There is neither but a mean warmth in a mans ſtomach, which when it is hotteſt of all, cannot be compared with the heat of fire, yet in a ſhort time, it Cooks and Digeſts Meat to ſuch an alteration, by its natural ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that the greateſt fire could not do the like with any meat in a Kettle or boyling Pot.</p>
            <p>It is alſo proved that the heat of the Sun and Stars moveth the Water, by this, that when the warmth of the Earth is aſcended in Plants, and there is Rain and Cold Weather, the Stream is then moderate, but when the Sun ſhineth hot, and it is Calm weather,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51993:51"/>
not only the Water is moved, and the Boffves break out, as is ſaid before, but the ſtreams alſo are then very ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, and the Ebb and Floud higher then ordinary; ſpecially during the Dogdays, when the <hi>Canicule,</hi> together with the Sun are hotteſt, but when the Dogdays are paſt, and the Sun advanceth to the South, the force of the Streams is weakned more and more untill Winter, during which ſeaſon it is but half as ſtrong as in ſummer.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, there is an other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary cauſe of the increaſe of the waters motion in Winter, which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the hardneſs of the froſt, and having ſpoken of it above, the Reader is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd thereunto.</p>
            <p>God having thus created nature, the Sea in the beginning was brought into a motion, which will laſt as long as the world doth exiſt.</p>
            <p>The form or manner of this Ebb and Floud hath moſt of all perplexed Philoſophers, every one having inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an Hypotheſis to Explicate it.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51993:51"/>
God is wonderful in all his works, and what ſeems hardeſt and difficulteſt of all to our underſtanding is often moſt plain and eaſie; ſo this wonderful augmentation and diminution of the water doth conſiſt in a meer motion to and fro between the Continents, from Eaſt to Weſt, and from Weſt to Eaſt: and that in great waves, as will be proved by the following argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the whole may be known by its parts, ſeeing that the drops of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are of a round figure, one may conclude that water is round. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as one ſeeth the Superficies of the water to be moved by the wind into waves, one may alſo aſſuredly conclude, that the motion of the great Ocean is made in Wayes; ſo the <hi>Boffves,</hi> whether it be by heat or cold, forming themſelves into waves, the larger Sea doth the like al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this is proved by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in Nature; Thoſe of <hi>Feroe,</hi> by this experience call this manner of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51993:52"/>
Ebb and Floud Eaſt and Weſt-fall; Eaſt-fall is that which with its waves falleth on the Eaſt of <hi>Norway;</hi> Weſt-fall is, when the Sea is moved and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth back with its waves to the VVeſt part of <hi>Greenland.</hi> The Eaſt-fall gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in <hi>Feroe</hi> Ebb or loweſt water, falling to the Eaſt of <hi>Norway;</hi> and making there higheſt water: Weſt-fall maketh higheſt water or Floud in <hi>Feroe,</hi> becauſe when the Floud falleth back from the Weſt of <hi>Norway,</hi> the Waves riſe and form themſelves higher and higher againſt <hi>Feroe,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of Waves, which is plainly proved by this, that at Eaſt of <hi>Feroe</hi> the Water riſeth but three Fathoms, and at Weſt ſeven Fathoms; the diſtance whereof is but forty miles in Longitude: Yea, one may eaſily perceive the Sea to ariſe higher at Weſt of <hi>Suderoe,</hi> then at Eaſt; though the Land where it is broadeſt, be not above eight miles broad.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, <hi>Galilaeus Galilaei</hi> teacheth, that it is the nature of water
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51993:52"/>
to lift up it ſelf towards its extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and run Horizontally between the Latitude, whereunto it is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that when the water hath its own motion without reſiſtance, it floweth Horizontally, without waves, as through Conduits, but when there is a reſiſtance on both ſides, the bottom is uneven, and there is no outlet, the one part by its perpetual motion dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the other, it muſt needs, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſuppoſition of <hi>Kircherus,</hi> ariſe and fall in waves, wherefore if it were as <hi>Galilaeo</hi> believeth, either there would never be Ebb or Floud in <hi>Feroe,</hi> in the Flemiſh Iſlands, or the Iſlands of <hi>Cape Verde,</hi> which both lye in the mid'ſt of large Seas, where the Ocean ſhould flow Horizontally, or elſe both Weſt-fall and Eaſt-fall ſhould make there Ebb and Floud, which never happeneth in Nature.</p>
            <p>Ebb and Floud conſiſt therefore without doubt and certainly in the motion of the Sea, like that of waves, to and fro from one Continent to another, or in the fall where the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51993:53"/>
one wave falleth upon the other, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one another againſt the Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now ſince the ground ariſeth toward the Land, and the waves lift and caſt themſelves over it, that muſt needs na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally cauſe the increaſe of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter towards the Land, whence it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth that Eaſt-fall maketh higheſt water under <hi>Norway,</hi> from the <hi>North Cape</hi> to <hi>Bergen,</hi> where the Sea hath a free courſe; as likewiſe to the weſt of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> except it be that <hi>Ireland</hi> lye in the way. As alſo to the weſt of <hi>Ireland, France,</hi> and all <hi>Africa,</hi> untill the Cape of good Hope, contrarywiſe, VVeſt-fall giveth high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt water under all the Eaſt Coaſt of <hi>America,</hi> and on the other weſt ſide thereof until <hi>Mare del Zuz.</hi> And on the contrary VVeſt fall maketh high VVater in <hi>Mare del Zuz</hi> under the Eaſt point of <hi>Tartary</hi> and <hi>China.</hi> In the mean time, ſometimes VVeſt-fall, and ſometimes Eaſt fall, maketh high water about the Iſlands which are ſpread abroad in the Ocean, and in the ſtill Sea, according as the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of their Meridian is, and the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51993:53"/>
Seas motion doth augment its waves. For Example, when the Sea falleth weſt on <hi>Feroe,</hi> the waves of the Sea fall then higheſt thereon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore VVeſt-fall maketh higheſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Quite contrary, when they fall back again, on the Eaſt, the waves have their cavities turned towards <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe,</hi> and therefore Eaſt-fall giveth there loweſt water.</p>
            <p>It is certainly true, that as God hath created all things according to weight, meaſure, and number; a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain wave falling at the weſt of <hi>Feroe</hi> in its retiring, Nature hath equalized theſe waves in certain number, thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and length (never to be altered) according to the diſtance that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Continents; and they are moved in ſuch an unalterable perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that neither the ſtrongeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wind can hinder their courſe or fall, nor a fore wind procure that they ſhould come ſooner or later; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, that the wind moveth but the uppermoſt ſuperficie, but cannot move the deep Abyſs thereof: VVhence it cometh, that when the great waves
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51993:54"/>
fall on upon the ground of <hi>Feroe,</hi> and the water muſt thruſt it ſelf over the grounds between the Iſlands, as through a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ce, and when there co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a ſtrong Storm againſt the Tide, which cou d well move the water from the bottome, in the ſame place where it ſeems that the courſe of the ſtream might be hindered, it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs not happen ſo, the force of the next wave coming from the main deep, beating after it, and the greateſt driving the leaſt, the wind not being able to hinder the cauſe, can neither hinder the effect of it; yet none of them being willing to yeild they ſtrive againſt one another with ſuch fury, ſtorm, and roaring of the Sea, that it cannot be expreſſed with a pen, and when the Tide falls back in its time, the waves grow quiet, and the wind appeaſeth it ſelf, as two mighty Enemies that can win nothing on each other, do at laſt agree, lay down their weapons, and walk the ſame way together. But as a great wind cannot hinder, neither cana fore-wind
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51993:54"/>
further the courſe of the ſtreams; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the great wave that goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the bottome of the deep, which cannot be driven further then its natural courſe doth require, after which the ſtream that is driven by the wind muſt needs regulate it ſelf, all what a fore-wind can doe, is only that what water it driveth afore it ſelf from the Superficie, may ſerve to increaſe the flood; whence cometh flood wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that breaketh over Banks, and endamageth many places; though from this generality particular ſtreams muſt be excepted.</p>
            <p>For a further proof of this former explication, it were to be wiſhed that one had or could get an exact deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Weſt Coaſt along <hi>Europe,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and on the other ſide the whole Eaſt Coaſt of <hi>America,</hi> and afterwards in the ſtill Sea, all the weſt Coaſt of <hi>America</hi> and Eaſt Coaſt of <hi>Aſia,</hi> as far as it lyeth open to the Sea, when it is higheſt water at the points, and in the Bayes, how high the water riſeth and falleth in every

place, and what is their Longitude? As alſo that one could get theſe three Points dilligently obſerved about the Iſlands over the whole world, or as far as might be; which if it could be performed one could plainly ſee and perceive that this demonſtration is ſo in nature, yea, one could alſo find how big and long every wave is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p>None ought to doubt of it, becauſe ſuch waves are not perceived by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, for as little as they can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the motion of the water in the Main Sea, as little can they perceive the waves riſing or fall, For the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in forty miles in <hi>Feroe</hi> being but four Fathoms of the waves riſing, how could it be obſerved by Sailers, Neither can it be diſcern'd any where, but about ſuch Iſlands at Sea: and having been undiſcovered and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try'd hitherto, the wit of many hath invented ſeveral Hypotheſis, which are not in nature.</p>
            <p>Much leſs ought any one to ſuffer himſelf to be ſeduced by particulars,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51993:55"/>
which are all irregular, and much of what is written thereof, upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of others, erronious. Thus the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have err'd in deſcribing the Currents of <hi>Feroe</hi> after the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Marriners: in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Kircherus,</hi> after the Deſcription of <hi>Olaus Magnus,</hi> and the relation of Seamen: alſo the ſtream of <hi>Moskoe,</hi> whereupon he hath grounded a great abſurdity to explicate the nature of Ebb and Floud; which hath made Mr. <hi>Herbinius</hi> in his publick diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to err ſo much that all his ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions fall of themſelves.</p>
            <p>But all particulars are explain'd when univerſals in their true grounds are right underſtood, and the Inlets and Points diligently obſerved. For an example we will take the ſtream under the the Low Countries in the North Sea, Catigate and the Eaſt Sea; according to our general demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration we find the Ocean to fall and run into the Channel with the great waves of its motion by an Eaſt-fall, as alſo to both ſides thereof of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51993:56"/>
               <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> afterwards it fills all the Inlets and Harbours of the Coaſt of all <hi>Netherland,</hi> thence the ſtream is divided into two parts or branches, whereof the one runneth Northward, between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> and on both ſides fills up all their Havens; The other runneth towards the Eaſt, between <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Jutland,</hi> towards <hi>Sweden,</hi> and endeth there its working; running back again ſix hours after from thence to the Channel, joyning it ſelf to the general motion of the Ocean at the Weſt of <hi>America,</hi> where then it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth higheſt water, about this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Stream, and its Ebb and Floud are theſe following points to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that it is cauſed by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral motion of the Ocean, and there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore the noting of the time thereof cannot contribute to the explanatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of this <hi>Phaenomenon;</hi> but the time o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

what is within turning it ſelf, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ends and points of Land, by a meer Flux and re-flux, as the Ocean falleth ſometimes on the Eaſt, and ſometimes on the weſt part thereof.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is obſerved that on the Eaſt ſide of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> as alſo over againſt it, under <hi>Norway,</hi> there cannot be a ſtrong Current, nor great Ebb and Flood, by reaſon that the wave which the Ocean drives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Channel, is diminiſhed by the many Inlets and Havens that are at the ſouth end of <hi>England,</hi> and in the reach of Land between high Sand to the <hi>Elbe,</hi> and the ſtream running af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards partly Northward; and the North Sea between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> not being perfectly moved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its narrowneſs here and there at Eaſt and Weſt, that little ſtream, according to its proportion, filleth both ſides; whence it comes that one perceiveth no great ſtream in <hi>Norway,</hi> till one cometh pretty well North, where the Ocean <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>loweth without hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51993:57"/>
and it is even ſo under the remote part of <hi>Norway,</hi> and other neighbouring places.</p>
            <p>In the third place, it is to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whether this Flood and Stream (which comes in through the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and runneth againſt <hi>Gottenborough,</hi> runneth not through the <hi>Catigate</hi> into the Eaſt Sea, and maketh there an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſtream of Ebb and Floud in ſix hours, as in the Ocean. Our <hi>Herbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> denyeth the Eaſt Sea all this, and for ought I could learn of our Seamen, they are almoſt all in the ſame opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not knowing any other thing of a Stream there, then what a conſtant Wind can cauſe, either out or in through the Sound. Nevertheleſs, the Stream which comes from the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel runneth into the Eaſt Sea, and out again, though inperceptibly, and all the Eaſt Sea (though it cannot eaſily be obſerv'd) hath its ordinary ebb and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oud, which is not only proved by the ſtream of <hi>Botthen</hi> above mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but can alſo be eaſily perceived by the little Current running between

            <p>The third proof of the manner in which ebb and floud is effected, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends of the Moon, which God hath created as an aſſiſtant to the motion of the Sea, in exerciſing two offices, by helping the motion thereof, and by directing it.</p>
            <p>That the Moon contributeth to its motion, is plainly ſeen, becauſe the ſtream is in general, during the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51993:58"/>
year, according to the propriety of every ſeaſon, ſtrongeſt and ebb and floud greateſt, in New and Full Moon, increaſing and diminiſhing according as the Moon increaſeth or diminiſheth its light: wherefore ſuch a thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth, I humbly conceive to be this, warmth being a principal cauſe to the motion of water in general, and the Moon being of a cold and moiſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when the ſame receiveth its light from the Sun, it groweth warm thereby, and by this warmth moveth the water. Now ſince it is moſt warm when it is in Conjunction or Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Sun, becauſe then it darts its beams directly upon the Moon. The Moon is then therefore moſt able to move the water, when it is New or at Full. Now the Moon gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally retiring every day from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the New Moon, twelve de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from the Sun, or coming every day after full Moon twelve degrees nearer it, ſo as it retireth or cometh nearer the Sun, it ſhooteth its beams awry on the Moon, and the more by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51993:58"/>
the Suns light is diſtributed, the leſs warmth doth the Moon receive, and therefore moveth the Sea as its warmth diminiſheth, or is increaſed; and therefore the motion of the Sea with its floud and ebb is greateſt, not only when it is new, or full Moon, but alſo three days before and after, and is leaſt when the Moon is in the Quadrate, or firſt and laſt quarter, but becauſe the Moon being in the Perigeum, or in Conjunction with the Sun, is then nearer both Sun and Earth, it ſeemeth then to have the greateſt warmth of the Sun, and to be able to exerciſe its overture on the Sea better, then when it is in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geum, furtheſt from the Sun and Earth, in its oppoſition or filling. The operation of the Moon is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs equal both when it beginneth to be new, and when it is filled; for the Moon having greater warmth and force at new Moon, it is thought to act by reflecting its light towards the Sun; the dark and cola part being tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Earth; yet having leſs
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51993:59"/>
warmth and force when it is full, it can nevertheleſs more conveniently and better pour down what it hath on the Sea, by turning its ſplendid aſpect directly upon it.</p>
            <p>But it is very remarkable that two or three days after the beginning of the new or full Moon, the Stream in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth at Floud, and doth not dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh; which ſeems to contradict and deſtroy our demonſtration, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we muſt ſeek another cauſe then the Moon; which in my opinion is this, whatſoever is heavy and is brought into motion by ſome violent force, doth not ſtraight ways dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh its ſaid motion, when the cauſe hath loſt its force; but rather augments it: it is even ſo in this caſe; The Moon hath ſome difficulty to augment the courſe of the ſtream when it is weakeſt, in its firſt and laſt quarter, but when it is grown rapid in new and full Moon, it cannot ſo ſtill it ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gain, but increaſeth naturally; ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Mover having loſt in two days time ſomething of its force.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51993:59"/>
This is plainly ſeen in the Sea, for when it hath been moved by a great Storm, it is more unquiet the next day, when the ſtorm is appeaſed, then it was whileſt it laſted; for then cometh that terrible Alde which we have deſcribed before, and at the ſame time that huge floud which ſtriketh up high in the Air againſt the Land. We might alſo diſcern, that by the Suns effect on the Earth, for it ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth hotter in the afternoon then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mid-day; not that its heat is then in it ſelf greater then before; but becauſe the Sun muſt in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon drive away the cold from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, but in the afternoon produceth its heat without any hinderance. This explication doth very well agree with the name, which Seamen give to that time of the Tide, calling it Spring, as if it ſprung by its own force, and would not be directed by the Moon.</p>
            <p>Secondly it is plainly proved that the Moon governeth the Sea, by the Quadruple motion of it, twice to the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51993:60"/>
Weſt, and twice to the Eaſt, in 24 hours and 48. min. according to the courſe of the Moon, though our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Herbinius</hi> will not grant that; not thinking there is ſuch a thing in nature as that the Moon by Antipathy could now in 6 hours and 12 min. drive the Sea from it ſelf, and afterwards by a Sympathy, in ſix other hours attract that again; whileſt nothing of all this happeneth by Antipathy, in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Herbinius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, according to theſe principles, the Sea is in a perpetual motion to and fro, as water in a Veſſel between its limits, againſt which if it beats, it cannot get over; but muſt appeaſe its proud waves and fall back again; which will laſt as long as the world continues. But the God of order that has created and ordained all things according to weight, meaſure, and number, hath made the Moon to govern thereover, not only as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cauſe with the reſt, in the manner aforeſaid; but alſo regulateth its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to its own ſeaſons, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51993:60"/>
the Moon having two Motions, the one from Eaſt to Weſt, together with the Sun, and other Planets and Stars; the other from Weſt to Eaſt, by which it moveth every day uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 12 degrees, from and to the Sun, which maketh 48 min. of time: ſo there can be no Antipathy between the Moon and the Motion of the Sea, to what ſide ſoever it turneth it ſelf.</p>
            <p>And God having made the diſtance ſo broad between the Continents, that it can be ſix hours falling back from one Land to another, which it would perhaps perform a great deal ſooner if it might follow its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion; nay it might well in its fury and rapidity, overwhelm the whole Globe of the Earth, by reaſon of the aforeſaid cauſes; therefore the Moon is made to hold back by its courſe that of the Sea, that it may not perfect its motion from one Coaſt to another in ſix hours or leſs, but in ſix hours 12 m. which maketh in the four Tides of a day 48. m. ſo that the Moon gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51993:61"/>
the Sea, as a man doth a running Horſe; ſometimes putting him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſometimes making him go ſlowly, at other times giving him the Bitt, and ſometimes keeping him back; and notwithſtanding maketh him ſo run, that it cometh to his Stage at the appointed time.</p>
            <p>This is my poor opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ebb and Floud, grounded upon my own experience and dilligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, whereby, having written it in our <hi>Daniſh</hi> Tongue, I would ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give Seamen occaſion to enquire into nature whereſoever they come, after this manuduction; which if they do, I doubt not, but they ſhall make ſuch obſervations, that this explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will thereby be ſo confirmed, that it will not be eaſily refuted. We will here tranſport us from the ſalt Sea to the freſh Water on Land, God can never be ſufficiently praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that hath ſo wonderfully and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly bleſſed that Country with well taſting and wholeſome Fountain Water, Springing ſome Fathoms high
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51993:61"/>
on the top of the higheſt Mountains; which in the greateſt drought runneth conſtantly almoſt every where; ſo that there is ſcarce a Cottage, but there runneth along a little Spring water, or a great Brook, gathered of many ſuch Rivelets; whoſe water is generally colder in Summer then in Winter, though they have there no healing Fountain for many diſeaſes, as in other Countreys, except one, in <hi>Oſteroe,</hi> near <hi>Gote;</hi> which yet is not much made uſe of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this water is of that nature, that it is much warmer in Winter then other Water; and if one will keep it a whole year it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth without corruption. One might, it ſeems, reaſonably conclude, that ſince Brimſtone is hot and keepeth Wine from corruption, that there may be Brimſtone in the rock through which the water floweth, whereby it is tinged with this quality, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is doubtleſs a great vertue hidden in that water, for the uſe of man, if it were as convenient to come to, as it is diſcomodious. Since all
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51993:62"/>
what ſeemeth ſtrange in the beings that God hath created, when reaſon cannot comprehend it, is preſently taken for a miracle, though it be an effect of nature; one may alſo juſtly hold this for admirable, that God by his wonderful wiſdome and power, hath ſo ordained it, that the mortal body aggravates the ſoul, and the earthly Tabernacle oppreſſeth the wandering ſenſes, ſo that they ſcarce reach the things which are on earth, and hardly perceive what it hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hand, as the wiſe man ſpeaketh, in the ninth Chapter of his Book of <hi>Wiſdome;</hi> whence cometh, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Sons of Men, that will not trouble their Brains with ſuch deep thoughts, do meerly conſider ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of nature as wonders, others give themſelves no thoughts at all about them, making uſe of them as unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures; others, to whom God and nature hath given more light of underſtanding, do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in ſearching the ſecrets of nature, ſo as to tire themſelves therewith.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51993:62"/>
Amongſt theſe ſecrets of nature there are not the leaſt but the moſt in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, namely, its courſe, and its aſcent to the top of hills, and its flowing down from thence.</p>
            <p>The ſtrange ſtream between <hi>Boetia</hi> and the Iſland of <hi>Negropont,</hi> called <hi>Euripe,</hi> which runneth in and out 7 times in a day, troubled ſo much that accute Philoſopher <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in his deep Speculations to comprehend the cauſe thereof, that he, as Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians believe, took his Death there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath alſo taken great pains to underſtand the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſe of the Springing of Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; but he hath been deceived in the invention of his reaſoning; <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> having long ſince refuted him. But the Wiſe King <hi>Solomon</hi> in <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi> 1. 7. teacheth us whence the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Springs come, and what is their natural cauſe: all waters, ſaith he, flow to the Sea from whence they flow again; but he teacheth us not the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how it happeneth, nor the cauſe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51993:63"/>
whereby the water can Aſcend, from the Sea, ſome hundreds of Fathoms high, through the Mountains, as it doth generally here on <hi>Feroe. Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> in his <hi>Phyſilogia lib.</hi> 4 <hi>c.</hi> 6. bringeth in the opinion of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; although we know not the cauſe of this natural thing, yet we judge that the water doth not mount up in a direct line, but through many turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and there being hollow veines in many places of the Earth and Rocks, the water doth run through them, and thoſe Conduits being nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, the Sea lyeth heavy thereon and preſſeth them ſo that the leſſer wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter muſt needs riſe above, and ſeek a way to get out where it can find it, whence come Springs and Fountains. Thus far <hi>Scaliger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Out of this meaning of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> the Ingenious Reader can eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that there are many trooked Veines or Conduits, under the Earth and Rocks, but yet it doth not follow that they cauſe or help the aſcent of the Water; for it cannot aſcend di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51993:63"/>
up, as we ſee it doth not through a hollow Poſt. By the help of nature and art, <hi>Archimedes</hi> inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a ſcrew to make Water aſcend from the place where it lyeth ſtill, which Screw was a hollow Leaden Pipe, that was twined about a round and long ſtaffe in the manner of a Screw, but it was to be turned about, and ſo the water was ſcrewed up; ſuch are not naturally found in the Earth, and though there be no ſuch crooked Conduits in the Earth, the water can nevertheleſs aſcend from the loweſt part of the Earth, to the higheſt top of the Mountains, as ſhall be demonſtrated hereafter. Beſides, it is to be noted, that the water of the Sea doth not throng or preſs up the water of the Fountains, becauſe it is more abundant or heavier then the water that is in the veines of the Earth; for if one layeth a horn on the back, ſo that both ends are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly high Horizontally, and one filleth it full of water, though there be then much more in the thicker end then in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51993:64"/>
the ſmaller, which it ſeems by reaſon of its gravity, ſhould endeavour to ſeek the bottome of the Horn, and ſo drive out the leſſer water, it cannot nevertheleſs do ſo, for the greater water cannot drive the leſſer higher up, then it ſelf lyeth high; whence it followeth that the water of the Sea is as high, yea higher, then the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Mountain, on whoſe top there ſpringeth Fountain water, which muſt be proved.</p>
            <p>All Mathematicians do truly affirm that Earth and Water make a round Globe together, as it may be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Eclipſe of the Moon, when the Earth lyeth between it and the Sun; for what is then darkened is round, becauſe the interpoſed Earth is of a round Figure. That Water is abſolutely round as the Earth, is proved by the cuſtome of Seamen, who when they will diſcover Land climb up to the Main maſt, whence they can diſcover it, when no body elſe can ſee it in the Ship; the cauſe whereof is the roundneſs of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51993:64"/>
for if it were flat they could as well ſee the Land below in the Ship, as above on the Maſt.</p>
            <p>Finally, the whole is like its parts, and therefore if a drop let fall on a Table, or on a Cloth formeth it ſelf round, the whole Maſs or body thereof muſt have the ſame nature and propriety.</p>
            <p>That Fundament being firm, and without contradiction, the wide Sea can ſoon mount, in the roundneſs of its figure, higher then any Mountain on Land is high.</p>
            <p>And therefore naturally, according to the aforeſaid nature of Water, can eaſily weigh up and preſs the leſſer water through the Conduits of the Earth, though they be not crooked, and that as high as the Sea is in its higheſt Superficie; which is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by the following Figure.</p>

K. as may be ſeen in the Figure, which it can eaſily do, till B. lying firſt Horizontally with A. but the Sea cannot drive up the leaſt drop thereof to N<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe it is higher then A The Water therefore runneth thus from K. down the Mountain over the Plain near L. and thence into the Sea, by O. which it will do as long as the World laſteth; and ſince the perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular of the Mountain I. K. is a third part of the length of the earth, ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameter C I. which alter the ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Aſtronomers is 859 Leagues, ſo the Mountain is high perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly

286 Leagues, no Mountain being ſo high; no, not Mount <hi>Olympus,</hi> that is eſteemed the higheſt in the World.</p>
            <p>And this ſuppoſition ſheweth the riſing of the Sea in the motion of its waves, expounded <hi>pag.</hi> 64. for if there be ſo great a difference of Floud in the ſpace of ten Leagues, what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is there then in hundreds of Leagues.</p>
            <p>This Demonſtration is confirmed by a rare example of a water in <hi>Feroe;</hi> for there is on <hi>Suderoe</hi> towards the South, near a little Village called <hi>Famoien,</hi> a little Lake, pretty high on the Mountain, that hath ordinary Ebb and Floud with the Sea, but it hath doubtleſs larger Conduits then other veines of water, through which it can eaſier riſe and fall; ſo that this example is a ſingular proof of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſtration aforeſaid: for if that Lake had Ebd and Floud immediately of it ſelf, other freſh waters that lye ſtill, would alſo have the ſame nature: but if this happens mediately, by reaſon of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51993:66"/>

            <p>That there runneth ſalt water in the Conduits of the Earth, and cometh out again freſh, is by this reaſon, ſince all Mettals and Miner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And whereſoever there are Mettals and Minerals in the Earth, the Water Attracts their qualities, and is tinged according to their nature; whence doth proceed ſeveral healing waters, that Earth draweth Salt to it ſelf, is proved by an Artificial Experiment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if one will bind a piece of linnen Cloth over the one end of a bottomleſs Cask, and fill the Cask full of Earth, pouring on the earth a quantity of Salt water, and letting it ſink through

the Earth two or three times, the Water at laſt will come out freſh, the Earth having drawn to its ſelf the Salt thereof.</p>
            <p>If any would conclude freſh Springs to come of rain water, becauſe when it raineth there runneth out more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the Spring, then when it hath been a long time dry weather, the Spring being then drained, and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing no water; It is anſwered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that rain cannot be the cauſe of Spring water on <hi>Feroe,</hi> the Land con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in hard ſtony Rocks, and high Steep Mountains, through which the Water can find no paſſage, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their ſteepneſs, muſt preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run down, nevertheleſs the water floweth more abundantly from the Springs, when it raineth in <hi>Feroe,</hi> and leſs when it is coryſtan drought, ſome of the Springs growing then wholly dry; which cometh from the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that is between the Air and the Earth.</p>
            <p>For it happeneth conſtantly and naturally, that when the Air is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd

            <p>Fire and Water being almoſt the two chiefeſt neceſſaries of mankind; nature having denied this Land Trees, ſo that there grows here none, except ſome little Junipers that grow in ſome few places near the Earth, nature

            <p>The Air of theſe Iſlands of <hi>Feroe</hi> is no leſs conſiderable then the Water; In Summer it is temperately warm, not very hot at any time: neither is the Winter very cold, though the Land lyeth under 62 degrees of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Latitude, it freezeth ſeldome a moneth together, neither is the Froſt then ſo hard as to produce Ice in the open Inlets, wherefore all Horſe and Sheep go into the Fields during the whole Winter, and never come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhelter, the cauſe of ſuch mild eir is the Salt Sea, wherewith the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland is embraced round about: which being warm both by its ſaline nature, and perpetual motion, produceth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51993:69"/>
and it is worth conſideration, that before the ſaid impetuous wind co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth or is perceived, the houſes crack and make a noiſe as if they would ſtreight fall down, which afterwards though not much moved, being low built, and on all ſides well defended with thick Walls made of green Turff and Stones.</p>

happeneth often, though the Sail be not up, that the Whirle-wind over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth the Boat and the people, as many examples do witneſs, and as Boats are in danger by ſuch Whirle-winds; ſo ſhips have ſometimes no leſs cauſe to fear thoſe Guſts from the Mountains, when they fail in greateſt ſecurity; for they in the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner fall down from the Mountains, when it is ſtill weather, as hath been expreſſed of ſeveral contrary Stormy Winds, which Forreign Marriners that come with their Ships between theſe Lands, muſt well obſerve or elſe they may poſſibly come in danger thereby.</p>
            <p>Specially it is to be noted about theſe Whirle-winds, that ſometimes on Land between theſe Rocks, when it is pretty good weather, and there is no danger, one of them will come on a ſudden ſo furious, that it beateth a man down from his Horſe, yea, beareth down Man and Horſe, as alſo ſtriketh down thoſe that are going on Foot, ſometimes hurting them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

thoſe that are uſed to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey can eaſily perceive its coming, for it is heard before, with a terrible boiſtering between the Clifts, when the weather is alſo very quiet; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Rider alighteth from his Horſe and layeth himſelf on the ground, holding faſt to the Graſs, or to a Stone, as he thinks himſelf ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</p>

            <p>There is told a ſtrange Story which
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51993:70"/>
is ſaid to have happened in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, by reaſon of a Whirle-wind; which the moſt part of thoſe that read it will perhaps not believe, though it be true. It happened a pretty long time ſince, that a Prieſt of <hi>Suderoe</hi> called, <hi>Broder Anderſon,</hi> travelled to one of his Pariſhes, namely, <hi>Sumboe,</hi> and when he came in thoſe parts, in a place called <hi>Sumboe Horſe,</hi> which is a very high Clift, above 200 Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms high, and hath ſeveral points, by reaſon of which, beſides the height of the Mountain, whether the wind bloweth from the Land or to the Land, there may be cauſed a ſtrong Whirlewind, and the high way being very near the edge of the promontory where there is always a pretty ſtorm, though it be ſtill weather every where below; (which happeneth by reaſon of the promontories height and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of the Airs free paſſage) hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that the Prieſt coming that way towards <hi>Sumboe Horſe,</hi> there came a ſtrong Whirlewind that took away the Prieſt and Horſe together,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51993:71"/>
and carried him beyond the edge of the Promontory, and another whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind coming directly againſt it, threw him again on the Land, without any hurt. Though this ſeems incredible to many, it is nevertheleſs told for a truth by many worthy of belief; I have my ſelf been at and viſited the place, according to the Scituation whereof, it ſeems that it might na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally happen, a ſtronger whirlwind having overcome that coming from the Land, it may then according to the nature of a whirlewind, have driven both the weaker wind and the man to Land again, which I do not only grant might naturally be, but believe alſo that God, by his Omnipotency, and the Protection of his Angels, hath contributed thereunto; others may believe hereof what beſt pleaſeth them. Otherwiſe, the ordinary winds that blow here, are for the moſt part Weſt and South Weſt, ſpecially in the Spring and Harveſt, theſe Winds being very moiſt; and it happeneth uſually that on the ſide of the Land
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51993:71"/>
where the wind bloweth, there is Rain and bad weather, whileſt on the other ſide it is fair and clear: which cometh by reaſon of the Lands great height.</p>
            <p>Here being no very hot Summer, neither is there any thunder heard du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that ſeaſon; but only in Winter, when there is a great Storm, and there falleth Rain, which is the more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, all being then turbulent.</p>
            <p>By reaſon of the Premiſes, there flowing almoſt by every mans houſe, a running ſtream, waſhing away all impurities that might infect the air, and the ſalt vapour of the Sea, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it from corruption, as ſalt keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth bodies from rotting; and though finally ſome poiſenous vapours might aſcend into it, it is nevertheleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually cleanſed by the perpetual Strong Wind and Thunder, that happeneth uſually in Autumn, Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Spring: there is uſually in <hi>Feroe</hi> a wholeſome Air, free from Peſtilence, Infection, and Contagious Diſeaſes, which do never range here,

except they be brought in by other ſick people. Neither are any here troubled with Agues: but it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented, that they who had it, and could not be quit of it in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by the uſe of Medicaments, have been freed of it coming hither by the Lands nature, without uſing any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Medicine, whence it comes that the people live longer here, then uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in other places. Neither are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren here plagued with the Small Pox as elſe where, this ſickneſs not being known here, except it be brought from Forreign parts, and then here is ſeen a great miſery, Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Children and Servants, old and young, lying then at once in bed of that ſickneſs; ſo that none of them can help the other, and the Sound ſhunning the Infected as death it ſelf. In the Year 1651. when I arrived firſt into this Countrey, there came a young man the ſame Summer from <hi>Denmark</hi> to <hi>Thors-Haven,</hi> who had been ſick of the Small Pox, and had brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him the Shirt he lay in, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waſhed,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51993:73"/>
which he gave a Woman to waſh, that was ſtraight ways infected by the damp of the ſaid Shirt, and by her again, others, that did not know the Diſeaſe at firſt; wherefore, when I came to that place, there was a great calamity, almoſt every one, both old and young lying a bed of the Small Pox, it being a great miſery not only by reaſon of the Diſeaſe it ſelf, that took away old and young, but alſo becauſe the Sound ſhunned the ſick, and refuſed to bury the dead, the Peaſants durſt not come to <hi>Thors-Haven</hi> to buy their neceſſaries, and though they all ſo much ſhunned the ſickneſs, they were nevertheleſs Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with it, till it had ſpread it ſelf over the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e Countrey, even over <hi>Suderoe,</hi> that lyeth moſt out of the way.</p>
            <p>Though the Air as aforeſaid be wholeſome, the land nevertheleſs is not therefore free from Sickneſs, but this Country, as well as other, hath its particular Diſeaſes, for the air being firſt cold and moiſt, whereby
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51993:74"/>
Flegme is dayly augmented, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants are almoſt all troubled twice a year, with a ſtrong Rhume, which they call <hi>Kriim</hi> in the Spring and after Harveſt, for it falleth at once on the Noſe and Lungs, with a ſtrong Cough and Spitting, head ach and pain in the Limbs, ſo that many muſt lye a long time in bed, and ſome dye of it. Againſt this Sickneſs they drink ſower Whey, as hot as they can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it, but this ſickneſs is a wholeſome Sickneſs to them, for nature in its fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt time, doth purge the body of all impurity contracted by the cold moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the Air, which might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe cauſe many and great Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, of this cold moiſture is cauſed, though not every year, a hot ſickneſs, called <hi>Landfarſoett,</hi> becauſe it bareth over the Land, not unlike to the hot Sickneſs, which Souldiers are taken with in cold and moiſt Leaguers in Winter; for that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is very hot, with accute pain of the Head and Diſtractions,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51993:74"/>
with Flux of the Belly in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and doth not ceaſe till it hath conſumed the very Marrow of the Bones, but they dye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Though the greateſt part are Healed by the Providence of God having no other Remedy againſt it.</p>
            <p>In the third place, this cold and moiſt Temperature, together with their dwelling on the Sea ſide, cauſeth, eſpecially in Flegmatick Folks that do not much ſtir them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, this dangerous Sickneſs, the Scurvy, that ſort of people not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here able to preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves eaſily from it; they Cure themſelves uſually with new Milk, wherein hath boiled Scurvy-graſs and many with new Milk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51993:80"/>
alſo helps to their Fertility, the Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Beams of the Sun being hindred thereby. One might here well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that ſince it Snoweth and Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the North Eaſt or North over the whole Iſland, and the Sun draweth Plants out of the Earth, it might be moſt fruitful, where the Sun doth ſhine the whole day with its beams, it is found in nature that the Sun it ſelf doth not produce the Plants from the Earth, but warmeth nature, and the night cooleth and moiſtneth what the Sun hath dryed and ſcorch'd, whence principally Plants are produc'd. In the Lands which lye under the torrid Zone, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all could grow, becauſe of the heat of the Sun, if the night was not as long as the day, and by its cooling and dew did not temperate the Plants.</p>
            <p>It is obſerved here in <hi>Feroe</hi> that in the midſt of Summer, when in two months time there is almoſt no night, Corn groweth but very little, though it raineth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51993:80"/>
watered in dry weather, and when the night beginneth to be longer, Corn and Herbs grow more in a night and day, then otherwiſe in fourteen: from whence it is ſeen, that the Sun at certain times doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damage Plants, and where it ſtriketh directly down, with its gathered Beams, conſumeth the moiſture and fatneſs of the ground; but where, by a moderate reflexion, it warmeth the Earth, (which happeneth in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys aforeſaid, where the ſteepneſs of the Hills intercepts the force of the Suns Beams) the Earth keepeth its Fatneſs and Seed in it ſelf, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth more Fruit; then elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
            <p>The Earth doth not only produce Graſs for Cattle, but alſo many Herbs for the uſe of man; for here groweth not only Garden Herbs, namely, Turnips, Carrets, Colworts, Lettice, Creſſes, Penny-royal, and ſuch like; but alſo ſeveral and many wild Herbs: ſpecially <hi>Feroe</hi> is to be eſteemed for four ſorts of wild Herbs,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51993:81"/>
that grow here in abundance.</p>
            <p>Firſt, of all, there being no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try that God viſits with any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſickneſs, but he cauſeth to grow in the ſame Countries ſome wholeſome Plant againſt the ſaid Diſeaſe; and <hi>Feroe,</hi> as aforeſaid being by its nature very ſubject to the Scurvy, God hath abundantly bleſſed the Land with Herbs, good againſt it, namely, Creſſes, Scurvy-graſs, Beccabunge and Sorrell.</p>
            <p>Secondly, here groweth a huge quantity of <hi>Tormentill,</hi> which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants having no Bark of Trees to Tan their Hides with, make uſe of; God and Nature having reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them the dryneſs of that Herb, ſo that they Tan their skins with it, and therefore call it Bark.</p>
            <p>In the third place here is found abundance of <hi>Angelica,</hi> which they call <hi>Quander,</hi> not only in Gardens and Church-yards, where it is plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but alſo in the open fields, and on the high hills: the Inhabitants take pleaſure in eating the great hollow
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51993:81"/>
Stalkes of it, that are not yet grown to Seed, whereof they peel firſt off the outward rind, afterwards they teare off the long filaments, eating the reſt for pleaſure, as they do elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where the fruit of Trees: they make alſo in time of dearth uſe of the roots of Angelica inſtead of other victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.</p>
            <p>The fourth Plant that groweth here is <hi>Radix Rhodia,</hi> called in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Feroe, Hielpe-Rod,</hi> whereof the Learned Doctor <hi>Simon Panly,</hi> in his <hi>Flora Dania</hi> writes, that it is in vain to ſeek it in Country Gardens, and much more in the wild Fields or ſuch other places, it being only found in principal Gardens where it is plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; nevertheleſs it hath pleaſed God to adorn <hi>Feroe</hi> with that Plant above other Countreys; if then <hi>Denmark</hi> by the ſaid Doctor <hi>Simon Panly,</hi> is praiſed for its Scurvy-graſs, <hi>Norway</hi> for its <hi>Gentiane</hi> and <hi>Chamaemorus,</hi> and <hi>Iſland</hi> for its <hi>Angelica; Feroe</hi> ought alſo to bear the prize for its <hi>Rhodian</hi> root; I have diſtilled Water of the ſaid root
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51993:82"/>
and found it in oder and taſte to be like Roſe-water, having made uſe of it in my occaſions and found content therein as in other Roſe-water, yet it doth not grow in every place, but only on the ſides of Hills, over-running waters or Lakes.</p>
            <p>Here grow no Trees except ſome Juniper Shrubs, in ſome few places, cloſe to the Earth; and ſome Willow Buſhes, but they do not grow high: It hath been try'd to Plant Fruit Trees, but they will not proſper, it may be the ſaline damps of the Sea are the cauſe of it.</p>
            <p>There being ſuch an abundance of graſs and herbs in the Land, there is alſo plenty of Cattel to feed thereon; here are no Wild Beaſts axcept Mice and Rats, though they are not found in all the Iſlands. Wherefore ſome think they cannot live where they are not ſeen, but we will leave that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decided. Venemous Beaſts, as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents and Snakes are not found here neither; perhaps the propriety of the Earth will not permit them to live
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51993:82"/>
thereon. Of Tame Cattel, they have Kine, Horſes and Sheep; thoſe that live in great Farms which are but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few, have ſometimes twenty Oxen a piece, the Cows goe often out to Graſs the whole Winter, provided there falleth not too much Snow. The Cattel is for the moſt part little though fat, according to the ground it feeds on. The Horſes are alſo of a little growth, but they are ſtrong, and go ſurely and ſwift, where the way leads, without Horſe-ſhooe, on theſe high hills; ſo that a man may more ſurely relye on them then upon himſelf; they feed abroad both Winter and Summer, without ever coming under ſhelter. Their Sheep feed alſo abroad the Winter over, and are half wild, ſome quite wild; nevertheleſs they go always, and feed in one place; ſo that they ſeldome go from their own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ground into another mans, though they be only divided by Hedges, as in other places; yea, what is more, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Flock feedeth in the ſame cloſe, and doth not mingle it ſelf with any
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51993:83"/>
other. For if a Countryman have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sheep, ſome 200, ſome 300, 400, or 500, they are devided into Flocks, which they call <hi>Oner,</hi> conſiſting each of about an 100, or an 150 Sheep; which Flocks feed always in their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual places, and the Countryman knows where he is to find every flock; the cauſe wherefore they do not go from their own place into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, or into another mans Cloſe, though they be Wild, and there be no ſeparation between them, is this; the Countryman ſetteth at firſt young Lambs on the place where he will have them to feed, which he cauſeth to be look'd to, and kept there a whole year, and ſuffereth them not to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where, but where he intends they ſhould be, and when they are ſo us'd to a place, they always feed there; the old ones keeping company with the young that are bred of them, the Flock remaineth feeding on its place as long as there is any living, and if a Flock dyeth or periſheth by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It happeneth notwithſtanding when a Country man putteth too many Sheep in his Cloſe, that they throng them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into his neighbours; and then the owner muſt take them back and kill them, for they cannot be diſaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed of it: about which they have a particular ordinance called, <hi>Siode, Breffvet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot be expreſſed what theſe Beaſts muſt ſuffer, when there cometh on a hard Winter, for when there fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth a haſty and laſting Snow, and the Shepherd is not ſtraight preſent to drive them into the Snow ſhelter (that is a place in the open Fields as a Fold incloſed with Fences of Earth and Turffe againſt the North, that Sheep may ſhelter themſelves there) the Sheep gather themſelves cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the open Field, and then it happeneth, that the Snow wholly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth them; ſo that the Country man cannot ſee them, till at laſt he perceiveth a damp ariſing from the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51993:84"/>
Snow, by reaſon of their warmth, and then he goeth and maketh a paſſage for them, that they may get out, and ſeek their Paſture It happeneth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that they cannot be found by reaſon of the extraordinary great Snow, and ſometimes, though ſeldom, that they then remain a whole month under the Snow, and ſuffer great hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſo that they eat the Graſs by the Roots: They alſo eat the wool off of one another, being able to remain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live as long as they have any marrow in their bones; and though a part of them be driven in time into the Snow ſhelter, yet there is no Hay given to them, but they muſt ſuffer what they can, and ſcrape the Snow off of the Banks, that they may get a little graſs; but that thoſe that are covered with Snow may ſometimes ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they let go in every Flock ſome gelded Weathers, which being big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and ſtronger then the reſt, break uſually through the Snow, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sheep follow them to ſeek their Paſture; by reaſon of this accident in
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51993:84"/>
Winter a Peaſant muſt be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full not to put more Sheep in the Cloſe, then it can feed; and every Peaſant knoweth how much his Cloſe can maintain and nouriſh, which they call <hi>Skibning;</hi> they obſerve alſo that the Cloſes cannot feed ſo many Sheep now as they did formerly; nature growing old and weak; and if any puts in too many, in hopes that the Winter ſhall be mild, they are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally leane: becauſe of their number; and then, if there cometh a hard Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they are not able to ſuffer much hunger, and therefore many dye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, ſpecially towards the Spring when the Sun beginneth to ſhine warm; for then they are ſo weak in that heat, that they lye on the place they are, and dye, as it were in a ſleep, It happeneth alſo, when there is a great Snow, that much thereof hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth beyond the edge of the Clifts, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Sea, which they call <hi>Skagel:</hi> whereon the Sheep often go and ſtand, and when the Snow begins to glide, all the Sheep fall into the Sea, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51993:85"/>
at ouce. Wherefore the owner muſt be very watchful to keep in time his Sheep from thoſe Clifts, ſo that be it never ſo bad weather, even in the night time, he muſt ſometimes go out with all his people; except he will receive damage.</p>
            <p>Theſe poor Inhabitants receive of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten great loſſes, when there cometh a hard Winter, often loſing a half part of their Sheep. By reaſon of theſe accidents their Sheep muſt have good care taken of them, whereunto there is always a certain man appointed in every place, called a <hi>Soidemand,</hi> that is as much as a Shepherd, and it is either the owner himſelf, or his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Servant, if his Farm be ſo much that he is able to keep one whoſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment is not only to take care of the Sheep in time of danger, but alſo to make them tame and obedient, driving them according to his will, when there is Snow. When one will take either the Wool or the Lambs from the Sheep, the Shepherd cannot do it alone, but muſt have three or
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51993:85"/>
four Men with him, and Dogs beſide, juſt as one goeth on Hunting: ſuch a Shepherd that is capable of his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment can know by his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al looking to the Sheep, every one of them, though he had a thouſand in his cuſtody, and they were all white, as they are for the moſt part, and knoweth alſo when any of them is ſtrayed, diſcerning it amongſt other Sheep, without apprehending it, or looking on the mark.</p>
            <p>They ſeek after the fruit of their Sheep twice a year; in the Spring when they ſheare the Wool of them and mark their Lambs; and in Autumn when they take of them to kill, and ſetthem to go and feed the Winter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, having when this is to be done, a place in the cloſe by the ſea ſide, which they call <hi>Retten,</hi> and is likea Sheep-fold, uſually compaſſed about with a Stone Fence, having a hole before inſtead of a door, that they may drive their Sheep through it into the <hi>Retten,</hi> which when they will do, the <hi>Soidemand</hi> goeth out with five or
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51993:86"/>
ſix men more, having each his Dog with him, and gather firſt one Flock driving it towards the hill, whileſt ſome men with their Dogs go by the ſide of the Flock, and ſome after, till they have driven the Sheep into the Incloſure, it being obſervable that theſe Dogs do almoſt as much in that work as the men, for a part of them runneth alſo along with the Sheep, and a part after, with the men; if any of the Sheep will ſeperate himſelf from the Flock, the Dog is preſently ready to drive him again into its order; if any Sheep runneth away, as it often happeneth, the Dogs purſue it preſently, and do not leave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>off till they have brought it back again, if ti be ſo that the Sheep will not be forced back; every Dog ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his Sheep by the Wool, and throws it down, without ever biting the Sheep in the Fleſh, and when the Sheep are ſo overthrown, they lye ſtill and dare not riſe till the men come and take them up; theſe Dogs are ſo taught, that when the Shepherd will
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51993:86"/>
have but one Lamb of the Flock for ſome occaſion, he goeth in the Fields with his Dog, and what Lamb he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly points at, the Dog taketh the ſame preſently without hurting it. Theſe Dogs are long and ſmall almoſt like Grey hounds, and when they are well inſtructed, they are eſteemed of equal price with a Cow; becauſe of ſuch Sheeps hunting, the people muſt alſo run very much, ſo that they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vomit blood, and ſuch continual running maketh here many ſwift Folks that are good and laſting run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. In <hi>Suderoe</hi> the people are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lazy, but they have lighter and ſwifter Horſes then in the other I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands; wherefore when they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Sheep, they ride, and their Dogs follow them, they knowing how to ride with their Horſes up Hills and down Dales in a full Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, through Moors, and over Rocks and Stones, ſo that the Horſes care for nothing when they hunt after Sheep, and where the place is too difficult to ride over to purſue them:
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51993:87"/>
the man leaps from his Horſe in the midſt of its courſe, and takes his beſt advantage againſt the Sheep, the Horſe running after him till he leaps upon it again; in the mean time the Dogs follow alſo, till they have dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Sheep into the <hi>Retten.</hi> A part of theſe Horſes are alſo ſo taught, that the man over reaching the Sheep on Horſe back, the Horſe graſpeth the ſame between his fore legs, till the man takes it up. They never ſhear their Sheep in Autumn, for they could not ſuffer to be bare in Winter, neither are they milkt at any time, no body being able to approach them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their wildneſs; in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they are quite wild and cannot be driven into the pound, but muſt be taken with Dogs; the Sheep are white of colour, or of a brown red; on the North the moſt part are white, but on the South they are moſt black and coloured, being ſeldome white, which is conceived to be by reaſon of the Sea vapours that continually fall on theſe Iſlands, lying for the moſt
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51993:87"/>
part more in the open Sea, then thoſe of the North that lye cloſer together. If one ſetteth white Sheep on Lille<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>diemen, which is ſeldome free from vapours of the Sea, they change their colour and grow black, which is not ſo to be underſtood, as that they ſhould preſently change their colour, but it is done in ſpace of time though ſooner on <hi>Diemen</hi> then on <hi>Snderoe</hi> or <hi>Sandoe;</hi> though I do not believe it happeneth as the Inhabitants think, by reaſon of the Sea vapours, having further inquired after this buſineſs, and found that the Sheep grew firſt ſpotted about their legs, afterwards on their thighs, then under their Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes, and finally all over. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the cauſe is in the earth, whether it be Brimſtone or Salt Peter, which both are found there that cauſeth it, I leave to the judgement of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>The riches of the Inhabitants doth conſiſt in their Sheep, for thoſe that have many of them, though few grow rich thereby, thoſe means being, very
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51993:88"/>
caſual; for when there cometh a hard Winter and Sheep dye, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all equally rich.</p>
            <p>Beſides Sheep, God hath plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſſed the Land with ſeveral ſorts of Fowle, whereof the greateſt part ſerveth for the food of man and are taken every year in great numbers; a part of them being Land Fowles, and the other part Sea fowles: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome fly away towards Winter, and ſome ſtay here the whole year over, thoſe that fly away are a kind of Land Fowl, being a manner of Sn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pe called <hi>Lofver,</hi> and <hi>Spofver,</hi> and ſome water Fowle.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that ſtay here continually, are ſome profitable, as Doves, Stares, Grellings, and Snow Fowle; which is ſeen but one time of the year, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, towards the Spring. VVhen there cometh ſharp Froſt and Snow, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver elſe, though they tarry continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Land, and keep themſelves on top of the higheſt Mountains, the Damageable ones are, Owles, Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-Hawkes, Crows and Ravens,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51993:88"/>
which laſt doth a great deal of da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage on young Lambs and weak Sheep, wherefore they are much ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and there hath been an ordinance in the Land, which is yet ſometimes obſerved, that every man that row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a Boat muſt bring at St. <hi>Olaus</hi> Tide, every year into the Seſſion-houſe, the Beak of a Raven, which Beaks are laid on a heap and burn'd and he that hath brought none muſt pay a Raven-fine, that is, for every one that hath neglected it, one skin, which makes two pence half penny. Amongſt thoſe Ravens there are found ſome white, though few: but thoſe that are half white and half black are fit, when they are taken young, and have the Tongue ſtring cut, to be taught to ſpeak. I have made a not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able experiment upon a young white Raven, whole Tongue ſtring was cut; and yet I had no thought of teaching him: but calling uſually in the morning upon my Boy, whoſe Name was <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> and the Raven cominually in the morning hearkning
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51993:89"/>
to that word <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> begun at laſt to call out <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> before the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber where the Boy lay, forming its voice exactly after mine: the Boy hearing it, anſwered, anon Maſter; and therewith aroſe and came into the Chamber, to know what I would have: but I telling him that I had not called him, he went to bed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but was again called in the ſame manner, and was ſo deceived by the Raven ſeveral Mornings, till we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it was the Ravens voice, and nevertheleſs the Boy was often ſince deceived thereby, not being in a long time able to diſcern, whether it was I that called, or the Raven. When I perceived that the ſaid Raven could ſpeak, I begun purpoſely to teach it, and as long as I would inform, it would not go from before me, though it were the ſpace of two hours; and what I taught it in the day time, it repeated early in the morning; put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Syllables together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till it could at laſt ſpeak out the whole word, as children do, when they learn to ſpell
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51993:89"/>
in the Schools. This Raven was at laſt killed without my knowledge, for the miſchief it did.</p>
            <p>Beſides, here cometh a Fowl with half a cloven foot, that liveth both on Land and Water, called a Teale, and in <hi>Norway</hi> a Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>pye; it is a Fowle as big as a Crow, having a yellow, long, round and ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſe bill, it is the Ravens enemy, for being ſwift in its flight, it flyeth haſtily to the Raven, ſtriking it with its ſtump Beak, ſo that the Raven cryeth out; wherefore the Raven often hideth it ſelf from it, whence it comes that the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men make much of the Teile, and will not ſuffer it to be deſtroyed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it driveth Ravens away: amongſt Water Fowles ſome are here continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſeen, as many ſorts of Ducks and Plovers, Eiders, Maws and Teiſters; A Teiſter is a good Bird to eat, it changeth its colour in Winter, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh Grey, the Eider cock is brown as the Hen, when ſhe is young, but when he is old, he groweth almoſt white, and is called Eider-blick,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51993:90"/>
from this Fowle is gotten Eider down which the Eider plucks off from its Breaſt, and layeth in its neſt about the Eggs, when it hatcheth them, and when they are come out, and are fled away with their dame, this Downe is taken up from the Neſt, being then full of Moſs and Straw; wherefore it is dryed and cleanſed over a Basket; the Down which is pluckt off at other times from the Eider is good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for it is fat and rotteth. Here is beſides ſeen a ſtrange water Fowl called Imbrim, that is never found on the Land; the Inhabitants take it to be the Halcyon or the Kings Fiſher, but it doth not agree with the deſcription, which <hi>Francius</hi> hath in his <hi>Hiſtoria Animalium ſacra, Chap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 17. for he writeth, that the Kings Fiſher is no bigger then a Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and is blew, with other of its qualities, that do not at all agree with the properties of this Fowl; for this is bigger then a Gooſe, having a long Neck and a pretty long Beak it is grey on the back, checquer'd with white ſpots, its neck is alſo
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51993:90"/>
grey, ſomething whitiſh down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the breaſt, having a white ring about the middle of the neck. The cauſe wherefore it is thought to be the Kings Fiſher is, they have heard and read, that the Kings Fiſher hatcheth its young ones on the Sea, which they believe the Imbrim doth alſo, ſince it is never found on Land, and can neither come upon it, for its feet ſtand too much back, and are ſo weak, that it cannot go with them; beſides, its wings are ſo little that it cannot fly therewith. In the third place, there are two holes, one under each of its wings, capable to hold an Egg, wherein they ſuppoſe it hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth its eggs, till the young ones come out, neither is it ever ſeen with more or leſs then two young ones; which conceit ſeems not unreaſonable, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſſible that it might be of a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger proportion in cold Countreys then in hot; it is often ſeen near the Land in Harbours, when it is either bad weather or like to be ſo: and then it cryes out ſo that one preſently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth

its arrival; if a man waveth a white linnen to them, the young ones will eaſily be allured to Land that one may ſhoot them, but the old ones are more wary.</p>
            <p>Here cometh alſo a water Fowle in Summer, called Liomen, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the Imbrim in bigneſs and voice; its legs hang alſo back, ſo that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not go, and its wings are ſo little that it can hardly fly; wherefore when it is on the Land, and men run after it, lit tumbleth over and over, being hardly able to eſcape, though it flyeth pretty well when it taketh its flight from the water, ſpecially when there blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any wind. It maketh its neſt on banks near freſh waters, ſo cloſe to the water that it can drink thereof ſitting in the Neſt; and if the water encreaſeth by reaſon of rain, ſo that it floweth over the eggs it ſitteth on them, nevertheleſs, and hatcheth out the young ones. Beſides theſe, here cometh alſo a rare water Fowle, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Garfugel, but it is ſeldom found on Clifts under the promontories, it
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51993:91"/>
hath little wings and cannot fly; it ſtands upright and goeth like a man, being all over of a ſhining black co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, except under the belly where it is white; it hath a pretty long raiſed Beak though thin toward the ſides, having on both ſides of its head over the eyes a white round ſpot as big as a half Crown, ſhowing like a pair of Spectacles: it is not unlike the Bird Pinquin, that is found in <hi>Terra del Fugo,</hi> painted and deſcribed in <hi>Atlas minor mercatoris.</hi> I have had that Bird ſeveral times, it is eaſie to be made tame, but cannot live long on Land.</p>
            <p>Here cometh alſo ſome damageable Fowl in the Summer, namely, the Swarth bag, the True, and the Skue. The Swarth bag is a great Bird like a Kite, it is white all over, but the back, where it is black, and therefore is called a Black back, it is of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a Mew, and is alſo reckoned amongſt that ſort of Fowl, it hunteth after leſſer Birds to eat them, and hath nothing olſe worthy of writing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:51993:92"/>
The True or Thief is called ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it threatneth and ſtealeth the meat from other Birds; for it hunteth after and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtrikes at them till they let the meat fall from their Beaks, and then he catcheth the meat in falling through the air very dexterouſly, and liveth thereby, not being able to plunge in the Water after Fiſh; and when it hath gotten ſomething from the one, he ſeeketh preſently ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, continuing ſo the whole day over.</p>
            <p>The Skue is of the ſame Species with the True, but ſomething larger as big as a Raven, being very fierce in the defence of its Eggs and young ones, ſo that if a man comes by its neſt, he muſt take a care of himſelf, for it flyeth ſtreight ways at his head, and ſtrikes him cruelly with his wings; wherefore the Inhabitants that know the temerity of it; faſten a knife up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right on their head againſt it, and it happeneth often that in falling with vehemence on the man, it is run through with the knife, and falleth
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51993:92"/>
down dead; being called Skue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſhooteth it ſelf ſo haſtily on men.</p>
            <p>The profitable Water Fowls, that come hither in Summer, are Wild-Geeſe, which are of three ſorts; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary grey Geeſe, reddiſh Geeſe, and Helſin Geeſe, that are leſs then ordinary Grey Geeſe, coming hither in great numbers, and keeping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in great Lakes of freſh Water. When they Mew, the Inhabitants go ſometimes on Gooſe Hunting with little Boats on the ſaid Lakes, taking ſometimes a great ſtore of them. Swans come alſo hither in the Spring, but they only reſt themſelves and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſtreight on their way to other Countreys. But ſpecially there co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth hither in the Spring in great numbers, to the Inhabitants great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and advantage, ſome other ſorts of Birds good to be eaten; amongſt which the firſt is principally worth taking notice of; it is called Sule, and is found no where in <hi>Feroe,</hi> but on the Iſlet or <hi>Myggoneſs,</hi> whereof the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51993:93"/>
have yearly a great help to their houſe keeping, they rehearſe a ſtrange Fable of the reaſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Fowl is only found there, and no where elſe, whereof we will ſpeak in another place. The Sule is a pretty great Fowl being of a blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh gray, it is alſo found in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and is called by Seamen, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>The other eatable Sea Fowls are found in great quantities every where in the Land, namely, the Skrabe, Lunde, Lomvifve, and the Sea-Daw. The Skrabe cometh in <hi>February,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout St. <hi>Matthews</hi> day, and fareth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way about St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Tide. The Lomvifve and Sea-daw come about St. <hi>Gregories</hi> Tide, and fly away at <hi>Mary Magdelens;</hi> Theſe Daws are none of thoſe that are ſo frequent in <hi>Denmark,</hi> thoſe being Land Birds, that are ſeen here alſo, though very ſeldome. The aforeſaid ſorts of Birds lay every one but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one Egg, and get but one young every year, and though they be thoſe that chiefly are ſought
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51993:93"/>
for, and there be well taken of them a hundred thouſand every year, there is nevertheleſs more of them then of any other ſort; yea, by the admirable providence of God, they are ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, that they in clear weather can darken the ſhining of the Sun. as it were with a thick Cloud, making ſuch a terrible noiſe and ſound with their wings in flying, that they, who hear it, and do not know the cauſe thereof, would not think otherwiſe, but that it were thunder. Every one of theſe Birds builds its neſt, and brings forth its young ones in a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>The Skrabe builds on the Land un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Earth, ſcraping with its Beak and Claws, lying on the back, whence it is called Skrabe, it diggeth under ground in ſome places a foot deep, in ſome other eight or ten foot in ſeveral turnings, ſeeking ſpecially to dig it ſelf behind a ſtone, where it thinketh to lye ſureſt. It breedeth as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, but one young: it being remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that this Bird is the whole day
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:51993:94"/>
away from its young, and never comes to it, but in the night to feed it, and if it flies not from its young at the dawning of the day, it ſtayeth with it the whole day over, till the night comes, and then flyeth out to Sea, till the other night cometh; and though the young is fed but once a day, yet it is ſo fat, that no Gooſe, though it have been three weeks fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, can be fatter: and they call thoſe young ones lyers, they do not by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their fatneſs, make preſent uſe of theſe young ones, but ſalt them to eat them in Winter; melting their fat, which they burn in Lamps. They have to take them out ſeveral hooks half an Ell or an Ell long, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they pierce them through, and draw them out. They do not uſually take the Dame her ſelf, except ſhe be ſometimes hurt with the hook, ſo that ſhe cannot live; but if they cannot get the young one with their hook, or by thruſting their arm into the Birds Neſt, by reaſon of the many turnings, they dig a hole down unto
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51993:94"/>
it, as near as they can gueſs, and then thruſt about with their hooks till they can get it; which hole they muſt again ſtop ſo cloſe that not one drop of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can come into it, for elſe ſhe will forſake her hole, and never come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more; which otherwiſe ſhe doth every year in the wonted place; ſo that the Inhabitants know in what place under the Earth they can every year find that Bird.</p>
            <p>The Lunde is a little Bird, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing bigger then a Pidgeon, whereof there is a vaſt multitue; It hath a ſtrong crooked Beak, ſo that if it bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a man in the hand, it teareth off the Fleſh; having alſo ſharp Claws. It wageth War with the Raven, that cometh and will take it away, and its young ones; It being a wonderful ſpectacle to ſee their fight, for as ſoon as the Raven cometh near, the Lunde catcheth it under the throat with its Beak, and graſpeth it about the Breaſt with its Claws, ſo that the Raven cannot hurt it, but muſt fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with a great crying; the Lunde
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51993:95"/>
holds it faſt in the mean time without letting it go, till they come into the Sea, where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lipping it, it is drowned. Yet the Raven doth often take the Lunde at unawares, ruſheth into its hole, takes it and eats it up. The ſaid Bird, the Lunde, buildeth its Neſt ſometimes on the Continent, far from houſes, digging it ſelf two or three yards, according to the nature of the place, under ground, lying on its back as the Scrape, ſometimes in Ures (that are places under high Clifts, full of great and ſmall ſtones, that fall from the Clifts, and by length of time, are filled between with Earth, and covered with Graſs) in which places they dig themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Earth, or build where there is no earth, their neſt under and between Stones, where they can come to breed their young with moſt ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>The moſt part being taken in ſuch places, ſo that man can often take above an hundred Lundes in one Ure; ſome of them build on the ſide
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51993:95"/>
of promontories, where they find great tuffts of earth in flat places, and when they fly from their Neſts, they firſt make them clean, ſcraping all the dirt and old roots out of the holes, and putting freſh graſs in them again. The Lundes that make their Neſts in the Fields, are taken as is ſaid, above of the <hi>Skrabe;</hi> but for ſuch as are under thoſe many ſtones, they let run unto them ſome little Dogs, that are ſo taught, which bring out both Bird and Egg to their Maſters; but when the Birds are fled, the men take them flying, which is done in this manner: they have a long Pole at the end of which there is a hoop drawn over with a net, whereof the maſhes are almoſt as big as the quarrels of a Glaſs Window, being like the Net, wherewith they take Shrimps in ſome places; and this they call a Stang of Staffe; with this Staffe the Fowler ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on the Clift, or in the Ures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the the great Stones, where he knoweth moſt Fowl to come, which they call flight places; and when the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51993:96"/>
Lunde cometh flying either from or to the Land, he lifts up the Staff and the Net againſt the Fowle, and when he hath got it into the Net, he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Staffe about, that it may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle it ſelf the better therein; a man being ſometimes able in that manner to take 200 Lundes in very ſhort time, beſides thoſe that are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in their Neſts.</p>
            <p>The Lumwifve is a pretty great Bird, wherefore they are generally called great Fowls; it is black on the back and white under the belly. The Daw is ſomething bigger then the Jack-dawes they have in <hi>Denmark,</hi> being alſo black on the back and white under the breaſt, having white ſtroaks about the Jaws, and a ſharp pointed Beak. It hatcheth its young ones in holes and ſhinks of high Promontories, but the Lumwifve layeth her eggs on the bare points and Clifts, that are many in the ſaid Promontories, there lying ſometimes on theſe Clifts ſome hundred Eggs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the place is large, but three
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51993:96"/>
fingers breadth from one another; and when the Birds fly away, the Eggs rowl often down into the Sea; but laying but one Egg ſhe ſitteth ſtraight thereon, and continueth ſo a months time, never ſtirring from the place till her young one be hatched: in the mean time the Cock bringing her to eat, and they Lay in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſitting cloſe to one another, Bird by Bird, all over the place, ſo that the Clift ſeemeth quite black, and the young one being hatched, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains yet three weeks with it, and then the Hen taketh the young one on her back and carryeth it to Sea; but when the Fowler cometh to that place, if there have not often been there men before, it happeneth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that the old will not leave their young ones, and therefore are taken with the hand, as many as they are, and kill'd, but where they are grown wild, by reaſon of mans continual hunting after them, they fly away, the young ones running together in a Flock; and when the Hen cometh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51993:97"/>
ſhe ſeeks the ſame place where ſhe fate before, and clacketh ſo long till her young one cometh to her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very well able to diſcern its own Dame, though they be all ſhap'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; and when ſhe giveth her young to eat, ſhe putteth her head back un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her wing, giving it ſo to eat back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>It cannot be expreſt with what pain and danger they take theſe Birds, in thoſe high and ſteep clifts, whereof many are above 200 Fathom high; there being men apt by nature and fit for that work, called Fowlers, who take them uſually in two manners; for either they climb from below up into theſe high Promontories, that are as ſteep as a wall, or they let themſelves down into them from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, with a thick, ſtrong, hemp-rope, when they climb from below, they have then a pole five or ſix ells long, with an iron hook at the end, which they tha are below in the Boat, or on the Clift, faſten unto the mans Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, or another Rope that the Fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51993:97"/>
hath about him, helping him thus up to the higheſt place, where he can get footing: afterwards they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo help up another man, and when there are ſo, ſeveral come up, every one with his Fowling Staffe in his hand, and the long Rope between them tyed to each others waſt, they climb ſo as high as poſſible they can; and where they find difficulty they help each other up by thruſting one another under the breech with their Poles: and when the firſt hath taken footing, he draweth the other up to him by the Rope faſtned to his waſt, and ſo they proceed on till they come to the place where the Birds build; going then after them about the hill as they pleaſe, and there being many dangerous glaces to climb about, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hound themſelves at the Ropes end, the one ſeeketh a convenient place where he can ſtand ſure and hold himſelf faſt, whileſt the other goeth about theſe dangerous places; if it then happen, that he chanceth to fall, the other that ſtands firm keeps
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51993:98"/>
him up, and helps him up again: but if he paſſeth ſafe, he likewiſe faſteneth himſelf till the other hath paſſed that dangerous place; and ſo they go about the Clifts after Birds as they pleaſe; though it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth, the more is the pitty, that when the one doth not ſtand faſt, or is not ſtrong enough to hold up the other in his fall, that they both fall down and kill themſelves; in which manner ſome do periſh every year.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Peter Clauſon</hi> in his deſcription of <hi>Norway</hi> writeth, that there was anciently a Law in the Countrey that whoſoever climbed ſo on the Clifts, that he fell down and dyed, if the body was found to be buried, his next Kinſman ſhould go the ſame way; but if he durſt or could not do it, the dead was not then to be buried in Sanctified earth, as one that had been too full of temerity, and was his own bane. But there is found nothing of that Law now adays.</p>
            <p>When they then are come, in the manner aforeſaid, to the birds, within
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51993:98"/>
the Clifts where they ſeldome come, the Birds are ſo tame that they can take them with their hands, for they will hardly leave their young ones; but where they are Wild, they either caſt the net over them on the Clift; and againſt thoſe that either fly from thence or thereunto, they oppoſe the Fowling Staffe with its net, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle them therein. In which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they take a great multitude of <hi>Lumwifves,</hi> Daws and Lunds. In the mean time there lyeth a Boat beneath on the Sea, wherein they caſt their birds kill'd; and in this manner they can in a ſhort time fill a Boat with Fowl. When it is pretty fair wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and there is good Fowling, the Fowlers ſtay in the Clifts ſeven or eight days together, for there are here and there holes in the Rocks, where they can ſafely reſt, and they have meat let down to them with a line from the top of the Mountain. In the mean time ſome go every day to them to fetch home what they have taken.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:51993:99"/>
Some Rocks are ſo difficult, that they can in no manner get unto them from below, wherefore they ſeek to come down thereunto from above, which they call to Sie, and is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond manner to purſue birds, being performed in this manner: They have a Rope 80 or 100 Fathoms long, and three Fingers thick, the fowler ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the end thereof faſt about his waſte, and between his legs, ſo that he can ſit thereon, and thus is let down, with the Fowling Staffe in his hand; ſix men hold by the Rope and let him eaſily down, laying a piece of wood on the brink of the Rock, upon which the Rope glideth, that it may not be worn to pieces by the hard and rough edge of the ſtone: They have beſides another ſmaller line that is faſtened to the Fowlers body, on which he pulleth, to give them notice how they ſhould let down the great Rope, either low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or higher, or to hold ſtill, that he may ſtay in the place whereunto he is come; here the man is in great
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51993:99"/>
danger, becauſe of the Stones that are looſened from the Clift by ſwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Rope, which often fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his head, and he cannot avoid it, wherefore he hath uſually on his head a Sea mans Cap, that is thick and very ſhaggy, to defend him in ſome meaſure from the blows of the Stones, if they be not too big, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it caſteth him his life. They put nevertheleſs themſelves continually in that danger, for our wretched bodies foods ſake, hoping in Gods mercy and protection, unto which the moſt part of them do alſo devoutly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend themſelves, when they go to that work. Otherwiſe they ſay there is no other great danger in it, but that in it ſelf it is a toileſome and artificial labour; for he that hath not learned to be ſo let down, and is not us'd thereunto, is turned about with the Rope, ſo that he groweth giddy and troubled in his head, and can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but he that hath learned the art taketh it but for a ſport, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to ſwing himſelf on the Rope,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51993:100"/>
to ſet his feet againſt the Rock, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting himſelf ſome fathoms from thence, whence he ſhooteth himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to what place he will, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth where the Birds are; he knoweth alſo to ſit on the line in the Air, and hold the fowling Staffe in his hand, taking therewith the birds that come, or fly away, and when there are holes in the Rock, and it ſtretcheth it ſelf out, making underneath as a ſieling, under which the birds are he knoweth skilfully which (is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt art) to ſhoot himſelf a great way from the Clift, and ſwiftly to ſwing himſelf under the roof, and there take footing, making himſelf, when he is in theſe holes, looſe of the great Rope, which he tieth to a ſtone of the Rock, that it may not ſlip from him to the outſide of the Clift; and then he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about in the Rock, taking the Fowl either with his hands, or with the Fowling Staffe; according to the manner aforeſaid; and when he hath killed as many Birds as he thinketh fit, he ties them in a bundle, and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51993:100"/>
them to the little Rope, giving a ſign by pulling, that they ſhould draw them up, working thus the whole day: and when he will get up, he ſitteth again upon the great Rope, giving a new ſign that they ſhould pull him up, or elſe he worketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up climbing along the Rope with his Girdle full of Birds. It is alſo uſual that where there is not folks e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to hold the great Rope, the Fowler driveth a poſt ſloaping into the earth, and maketh the Rope faſt thereunto, letting ſo himſelf down without any bodies help, to work in the manner aforeſaid; ſome Rocks are ſo formed that one can go in them from the Land, and there he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his Comerades with him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in the manner aforeſaid, each taking as much Fowl, as the Girdle about his waſte can hold, and as much as he can carry in a bundle on his back, carrying them in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner home. There are alſo in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces high ſteep Clifts, under the Land, that ariſe above an hundred Fathoms
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51993:101"/>
from the Sea, that are almoſt as bad to come unto, as the Rocks, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they help alſo one another in the aforeſaid manner, taking a ſtrong Rope with them, which they faſten here and there about the Clift, and let it hang there the whole Summer, by which they nimbly climb up to take Fowle when they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe manners are more terrible and dangerous to ſee, then to deſcribe, ſpecially if one conſiders the ſteep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and height of the Rocks, it ſeeming not poſſible that a man could come to them, much leſs climb or be let down into them. They go alſo in ſome places where they can only faſten the ends of their Toes and Fingers, not ſhunning ſuch places, though there be a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Fathoms height between them and the Sea.</p>
            <p>It is a dear Meat for theſe poor people, for which they muſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their Lives ſo extreamely and many after long ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51993:101"/>
at laſt do periſh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>When that Fowle is brought home, a part thereof is eaten freſh, another part, when there is much taken, being hung up to dry for Winter proviſion. The Featers being gathered to make Merchandize of for other expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants get a great many of thoſe Fowles as God giveth his bleſſing, and fit weather. Yet this is not every where in the Land, but only in the Iſlands that lye towards the Sea, and have great Promontories, as the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern <hi>Iſlands, Myggyneſs, Waa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, Skuo,</hi> the <hi>Diemens,</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when it is dark Weather, they take moſt, for then the Birds ſtay in the Rocks, but in clear Weather and hot Sun-ſhine they ſeek the Sea, and againſt their flying away, they keep themſelves
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51993:102"/>
moſt there, ſitting on the Clifts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sea ſide, where people go alſo ſometimes to them with Boats, and take them with Fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Staves.</p>

            <p>Cods are uſually found in certain places of the Sea called Meads, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a certain time when they come and when they go away.

            <p>The third manner is very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and is called to go on Later, this word Later is not a Latine Word, but an old word of the Language of <hi>Feroe,</hi> ſignifying as much as coupling, for when the Kobs are coupled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they call it then properly at La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris. For here are many hollow places, from the Sea into the rocks, being large and wide cavities, as great Vaulted Cellars, before which there is a little hole, as a door, ſo that a ſmall Boat can go into them; within the hole the water is deep, ſo that one can yet go farther in with the boat, but it becometh ſhallower and ſhallower; and at laſt is dry ground, with a ſpacious Vault, ſo that there is a great Eccho within when any body ſpeaketh, being ſo dark there, that one cannot diſcern whether it be day or night.</p>
            <p>The Kobs have their habitation in
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51993:105"/>
theſe Vaults or Caves, ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 100 together; and becauſe the Inhabitants are of opinion that they couple therein, they do therefore call them Later, and to ſeek thoſe holes to kill the Kobs, is called by them, to go on Later, Theſe Caves are of two ſorts, whereof the ones entrance is under water, where no man can come in, and is called Kaufve-Later becauſe the Seals dive under water when they goe into them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other whoſe Orifice is above water. The Peaſants have particular ſmall boats to go into theſe Caves with, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they know that the young Seales are great and fat, they go with their Boats into the Cave, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving uſually two Boats, with the one of which they get in, the other ſtaying without at the entrance, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving between the Boats a Tow of 80 Fathoms length or larger, that if the Boat which goeth fartheſt in, be fill'd with water, as it often happeneth, the other, that is at the entrance, may pull it out with the people in it; and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51993:105"/>
the Cave being narrow, they have a pointed ſtake on each ſide, wherewith they thruſt themſelves in: They have alſo two Candles in the Boat, that they may the better ſee to kill the Kobs, it being ſo dark within; The ſaid Candles are as thick as a mans arm, and they hide them in the Boat, leaſt the Seales ſhould ſee the men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come on dry ground. When they are come ſo far in the Cave that they can feel ground, which they try with their pointed Staves, firſt one Man leapeth out from the Boat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the water, as deep as he can wade, having a club in his hand to fell the Kob with, which they call Kob graſs then leaps the ſecond man after him, having a Candle in each hand, which he muſt hold over his head that they be not put out with the water, after them cometh the third man, that hath alſo a felling Club to ſtrike with, when the Seals lying on dry ground, begin to ſee the Light and men, they will flee to Sea, wherefore the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51993:106"/>
old ones riſe themſelves on their paws with their Jaws open directly againſt the man, ſpecially if it be a He, for then he will not flee from the man, but the man muſt avoid him, and when he ſtrikes at him he meeteth the blow with his jaws, ſnatching the Club from the mans hands, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting it on that ſide, where there is no body. Then comes the other man with his Club, and ſtrikes him over the neck, but if it be a Shee, ſhe is not ſo fierce, and fleeth from the man if ſhe can. When they hit them right o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the head, they fall down in a ſound and then the men are preſently ready ſo cut their throats. When they have done ſo with all the old, they come to the young ones that lye all ſtill, far from the water, and never take notice of men nor light, till they come and kill them; when the ſlaughter is finiſh'd, they hale the dead Kobs to the Water ſide, and tye them faſt to the Rope, wherewith thoſe in the Boat without pull them to them. Laſt of all the men get out with the Boat that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51993:106"/>
is within, but if the waves be great, the ſaid Boat and men are alſo haled out. In this manner they get ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times many Seals, often half a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in one Cave, the old Kobs are as big as an Ox or Cow, and ſo fat, that one can get three Loads of Fat from them; they uſe their skins for Shooes, and eat the fleſh of them: they melt the Fat into Train Oyle, and ſalt a part thereof to eat.</p>
            <p>There are found ſeveral ſorts of Whales under this Land, amongſt which there cometh one ſort, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Grind-Whale; Grind according to the explication of Mr. <hi>Peter Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> ſignifieth all ſort of grates or Trel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices, either of Iron or Wood, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this ſort of Whale ſwimmeth ſide to ſide by one another, when they go on coupling, ſuch a Flock of Whales is called a Whales Grind. Theſe Grind-Whales are not great, the biggeſt being but five ells long, and the young ones an ell and a half, they come in great Flocks under the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51993:107"/>
Land, when it is dark or foggy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that they cannot ſee it; which is therefore called Grind-weather. When the Inhabitants are out about their Fiſhing, and ſee a Flock of Whales, thoſe that ſee them firſt call and make ſigns to the other Boats that are about them, who leaving their fiſhing, come preſently together, and go to the Whales, to drive them in towards the Land; but when the Whales will turn back towards the Sea, they cry out and make the moſt noiſe they can in the Boat, throwing ſtones and what elſe they can find at them, till the Whales turn again, and then when God giveth his bleſſing, they can drive them where they pleaſe as if it were a Flock of Sheep or Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. When they come to Land they ſend a man or two to give notice e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, and this meſſenger muſt go ſpeedily day and night, and is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Grind-meſſage. Thoſe then that get notice of it preſently, kindle a brand on a certain place, that they on the next Iſland where the meſſage
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51993:107"/>
is not come, may get timely notice of it, who can know by the place whence the Fire or Smoak ariſeth, what it ſignifieth: whereupon there cometh ſpeedily a great number of Folks together, ſome by Land and ſome by Water, having their Whale Spears with them. When they have then brought as many Boats together as they think needful, they drive the Whales into an Inlet, or Creek, where they know there are good Whale-banks, and flat ſandy grounds, whereon they drive the Whales, with great crying, noiſe, and caſting of Stones, driving them as faſt as they can upon the Sands; then if it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, the Boats divide themſelves into two companies, the one lying below in the form of a half Moon, to meet the Whale if it wou d flee away during the ſlaughter, the other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing into the midſt of the Whale Flock, thruſting their Whale Spears into their bodies; in the mean time ſome of the people lye in an ambuſh on the Land, till the Whales are come
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51993:108"/>
on ground, and wade to them as deep as they can, and then kill them chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with their Weapons, with ſuch fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on both ſides, that the water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh as red as blood; whereby the Whale is alſo blinded, ſo that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee to run away; it is a ſtrange thing, to ſee that theſe ſtrong creatures make no reſiſtance, but only plunge as well as they can before the boats, and people, till death cometh upon them, and then they ſtrike terribly about with their Tayles, ſo that they beat ſometimes the boats to pieces, and the men come in danger, if they do not know how to have a care of them. Some of them get again looſe from the Sands, and carry ſometimes the boats a great way with them on their backs, over-turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them here and there and ſtriking them full of water, yet thoſe that are below drive them in again, but if they are not able to force them thereunto, the reſt come to their help, &amp; ſo make them return, though it happeneth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſometimes, that they will at laſt
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51993:108"/>
ſuffer themſelves to be driven in no more, plunging and diving ſo much and a long way under the water, that they muſt let them go; the ſame hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth alſo at Sea, when they ſee them firſt, and will drive them to Land, for then they plunge ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo much that they muſt give them over, whence one may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that this work doth only conſiſt in a bleſſing of God.</p>
            <p>When they have killed as many as they can get, which laſteth well a whole day or longer, they hale them on Land, and thoſe that are killed at Sea float up the next day, and are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo driven thither. When all the Whales are thus brought on dry ground, and are toll'd, firſt the Tithes are taken of them, then the Finding-Whale for him that ſaw them firſt; the reſt being divided into two parts, the one whereof belongs to the people that took them, and the other part to the owner of the Land under which they are taken, whether it be the Kings, ſome Noblemans, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51993:109"/>
to ſome Free-holders ſon; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the whole Flock of Whales co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into the Inlets of it ſelf in foggy weather, no body driving them, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they come in with the Tide, in a dark night, running on the Sands, where they lye dry when it is low water, ſo that when folks come out in the morning they ſee ſometimes the Sand covered with dead Whales; which happened alſo for few years ſince in <hi>Tiorneviig,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In antient time there came greater multitudes of Whales and oftner then in our days; though it happened that in the year 1664, there were taken in two places, about a thouſand. Wherefore the Lord, as alſo for his other benefits be bleſſed and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>As we have ſaid before, theſe Whales have ſhort heads, and little eyes, they have a black skin with a white ſtroke under the belly, and are pretty fat; they have a palm thick of fat, the head is almoſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but fat, they partly melt the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51993:109"/>
fat of the whole to make Train Oyl, ſalting the reſt with black ſalt, to make uſe of it as of Bacon. This ſort of ſalt they prepare of ſea weeds, which they dry and burn to aſhes; where with they ſalt their fat, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving it very well thereby, being hung in a dry place, it looketh black and as ſmoked Bacon, but within it is white as the other; he that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, is not, will not be able to diſcern it from Swines Bacon; another part they alſo make uſe of inſtead of fat or butter, which they uſe to put in their meat, as ſhall be ſpoken of in another place. They dry and eat the fleſh when it is freſh, the ſame looking and ſmelling as Beef; and what they cannot ſtraight conſume they cut into long ſegments and hang it up to dry in the wind, conſuming it afterwards in time, as other ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fleſh. Forreigners ſometimes pickle ſomething of the tayl, which taſteth very like neats feet, wherefore the Inhabitants take theſe Whales to be, and call them Sea kine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:51993:110"/>
Mr. <hi>Peter Clauſon</hi> writeth in his Deſcription of <hi>Norway,</hi> that theſe Whales are driven in by a Whale-Dog, whereof I have often enquired, but could never get any certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it; yet I cannot abſtain from informing the curious Reader, of what is at laſt come to my knowledge. It happened in the year 1664, when there came many Whales in <hi>Skaale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſord,</hi> about Harveſt, as aforeſaid, that when the greateſt part of the Whales were killed, there appeared a Sea Monſter ſwimming about the Whales, between them and the Land, that was in every manner like a Dog, as for thoſe parts that were above water, it was of a grey colour, hairy, with long ears like an Engliſh rough Spaniel, this hath been told me by men worthy of credit, and the fame of it grew common over the whole Country, <hi>John Theodore de Bry</hi> in his deſcription of the Weſt India Voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, writeth that there is a ſort of Sea Dogs found in the <hi>Magellanick</hi> Streights, that are hairy on their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51993:110"/>
to the middeſt of their body, with ſhort ears, as one uſes to cut thoſe of rough Dogs, or like Lyons, their fore feet being like the hands of men, and their hinder parts like a Fiſh: They are great and terrible to look on, whence one may finally conclude that there are ſuch Whale Dogs, though I cannot decide whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be of the ſame ſort with thoſe that are in the Weſt Indies; There are doubtleſs more Sea Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters yet, then have been known hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto.</p>
            <p>Here is alſo taken another ſort of Whales, which they call Doglings, and are uſually found in one Haven of this Country, namely, that of <hi>Qualboe</hi> in <hi>Suderoe,</hi> and ſeldome in <hi>Vaage</hi> in the ſame Iſland, and that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually in Autumn, three, or four, or ſix almoſt every year, and if they fail one year there comes the next year twice as many; they are 7 or 8 els long, and very thick, being about 2 ells broad, where they are thickeſt. They are taken in a very ſtrange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51993:111"/>
for when the people perceive them without the Inlet, they row out to them with ſome Roaps in their Boats. If it be bad weather, ſo that they cannot come near them, they drive them into the Inlet, as they uſe to do with thoſe called Grinds. But if it be calm weather, they row cloſe to the Whale, that lyeth there ſtill by the Boat, thinking it perhaps to be its Mate: In the mean time they pierce a hole in the fat of its eye lid, wherein they faſten the Rope; the piercing whereof hurteth it not, but only tickleth it, wherefore it ſuffereth the ſame willingly; when they have thus faſtened the Rope, they row to a Sandy Bank, whither it ſuffereth it ſelf eaſily to be drawn, and the reſt follow after, till they are all gotten on the ſand, and then in like manner they make the Rope faſt to the other Whales, tying the other end faſt to ſome ſtones on Land, and laſtly row out to them with their Boats, piercing them with their Whale-Spears, till they loſe their blood and dye; but
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:51993:111"/>
then the men muſt retire and have a care of themſelves, for they beat then terribly about them.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>John Theodore de Bry</hi> in his Hiſtory of the Weſt Indies relateth, that the Indians on the Coaſt of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida</hi> take Whales in this manner; when any one ſees the Whale on ground, they row to it with a Boat, having a ſtrong Rope with them with two ſtakes on both ends; when the American cometh to the Whale, he climbs upon it, and ſtrikes firſt the one ſtake into the Pipe through which it draweth breath and blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up water, driving alſo the other ſtake through the other hole; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Whale is choaked at laſt, and when it is dead, there comes more people to help him to draw it on land. This manner ſeemeth ſtrange, but ours in <hi>Feroe</hi> is no leſs wonderful. The fleſh and the fat of theſe Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are not good to eat, for if one eateth thereof, it pierceth through the pores, ſo that ones clothes look yellow and ſmell of it, the Oyl thereof
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:51993:112"/>
being ſo ſubtile that it muſt be mighty ſtrong and faſt wood that can hold it. It is very remarkable that this Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Whale cometh uſually no where in <hi>Feroe,</hi> but in <hi>Suderoe,</hi> and that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in <hi>Qualboes</hi> Inlet, every year about <hi>Michaelmas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is related a ſtrange ſtory about it, which can be accounted but for a Fable; They ſay, it happened once during the darkneſs of Paganiſm, when <hi>Feroe</hi> was firſt inhabited by men, that a Gyant under took to poſſeſs himſelf of the Iſland of <hi>Myg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneſs,</hi> a Sorcerer dwelling on the land would hinder him, wherefore the man did often fight with the Sorcerer, and at laſt vanquiſhed him; wherefore the Sorcerer made an agreement with him, that if he would not deſtroy him, but let him have his habitation in the Iſland, he would yearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him a ſort of Whales and Fowl in the Land, which were not gotten in other places of <hi>Feroe;</hi> and that for him and his Succeſſors as long as the world ſhould laſt; though with this
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:51993:112"/>
condition, that if any one mocked or derided his Whale, it ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come any more: which conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the man accepted, and ſince that time there came yearly a particular ſort of Whale under the Land; as the Inhabitants relate and have by relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Predeceſſours, the ſaid Whale had but one eye; finally it happened that an indiſcreet man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weary of the labour he had every year by reaſon of that Whale, did contemn it, for having but one eye, wherefore it never came there ſince; the Inhabitants believing it removed thence to <hi>Qualboe</hi> in <hi>Suderoe,</hi> they alone, and almoſt every year having them, though they have two eyes as other great Fiſhes. The Fowl where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Sorcerer did preſent <hi>Myggy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> is the ſule deſcribed above: which is neither found any where in this Country except there; this is ſold for the price it coſt. Though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things happened in thoſe dark times amongſt the Children of infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, both there and other places, that
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:51993:113"/>
ſeem now in this our light, to be very diſconſonant and incredible, as yet dayly many things are perpetrated by Witches, which the childten of light cannot apprehend, much leſs imitate them therein.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants receive alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a conſiderable profit from the Whales that are pierced at Sea, which come ſometimes floating hither to the Land.</p>
            <p>Here are beſides ſeen under the Land great living Whales, as the Roar and Witch-Whale, on which the Inhabitants dare not venture. The Roar is very great and long, and the Witch-Whale very dangerous; for it will play with Boats: ſometimes it riſeth from under the water under the Boat, ſo that it ſtandeth faſt on its back as upon a Rock, which often bringeth the people in great danger. But God and Nature have revealed them a ſtrange ſecret means to drive away ſuch dangerous Monſters, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Caſtoreum,</hi> which uſually they carry in the head of their Boat, boar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:51993:113"/>
a hole in the Wood, and putting <hi>Caſtoreum</hi> in it, which they ſtop af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with a peg; others have it incloſed in a piece of wood, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they link their Fiſh lines, and carry it always with them in the Boat; and when the Witch-Whale comes under ſuch a Boat, or that they caſt that piece of wood upon it, it ſinketh to the bottome as a Stone. This Whale muſt have a very good ſcent, and cannot ſuffer the ſmell of <hi>Caſtoreum,</hi> wherefore it retireth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to the deep. It is believed here by old experience, that <hi>Caſtoreum</hi> hath this property, that if a man hath any about him and cometh in danger upon the water, he cannot ſave himſelf, but ſinketh to the bottome, as a piece of Lead, and drowneth; for it hath been proved by experience, that a perſon that could ſwim well, periſhed at Sea having <hi>Caſtoreum</hi> about him; being ſunk and drowned, whileſt others that were in the Boat and could not ſwim, ſaved their lives; whereof the ſamous expert and learned Dr. <hi>Thomas Barta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:51993:114"/>
writeth in his Centuries of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomical Hiſtory, <hi>Cent.</hi> 2. <hi>Hiſt.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants ſay alſo that if they have no <hi>Caſtorum,</hi> they carry with them Juniper wood, whereof they cut Chips and caſt towards the Whale, whereby it alſo ſinketh. It was a great while before I would believe this, till the Provincial Judge, a very prudent man, named <hi>Jonae Poulſon,</hi> that is well inform'd in the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties of this Country aſſured it me to be true; I would nevertheleſs hardly believe it a long time, till I had found the natural cauſe of it, which is this: Since <hi>Castoreum</hi> that can drive down the Whale, hath the vertue to drive the dead Foetus out of its mothers Womb; by which vertue the Whale is alſo driven; and the Oyl of Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hath the ſame vertue as <hi>Caſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> to drive out the Foetus, it may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be that Juniper Wood, whereof the Oyl is prepared, may alſo drive the Whale; and there muſt be a great Antipathy between the Whale and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:51993:114"/>
ſuch things which by reaſon of its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute ſcent, it preſently perceiveth, and is weakned in its nature, ſo that it muſt preſently ſink to the bottom, by which reaſon it followeth alſo, that all other Medicaments expelling the dead Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, have alſo the vertue to drive down the whale, as are <hi>Aſſa Foetida, Myrrha, Galbanum, Oppoponax, Scammony, Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, Cinnamon</hi> and <hi>Mace,</hi> or theſe Herbs, <hi>Rue, Sabina, Foenum Gracum, Hollow Hearb, Felworth Matricary,</hi> as alſo theſe Herbs which grow in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe, Samphire, Mugworth, Tyme,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, though part of the Species afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, be but the ingredients of thoſe Medicaments. Experience muſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teach what is hidden in nature, if it be ſo as is argued of this Species; and if <hi>Castoreum</hi> hath the propriety and vertue to depreſs a man down to the bottom of the Sea, ſo that he muſt drown, notwithſtanding he can ſwim, it followeth alſo that the aforeſaid Species have that propriety to the depreſſion of a man. One doth beſides often hear that when people come in
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:51993:115"/>

            <p>THeſe Iſlands of <hi>Feroe</hi> lying in the mid'ſt of the ſtorming Sea, far diſtant from other Countryes, have during a long time, whileſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation was not ſo much practiſed, as in theſe later times, been uninhabited; being only viſited by the Fowles of Heaven, till the time of <hi>Harold Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chricomus,</hi> firſt abſolute King of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> when as we are taught by the Chronicle of <hi>Snore Sturleſon,</hi> this land was firſt poſſeſſed by men, and inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the year of our great Monarch Jeſus Chriſt's Nativity 868. having

               </gap>5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> years, and hath been tilled, till the date of this book, a little above 800 years. The cauſe of its inhabitation being this; It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that <hi>Harold Haldanſon Pulchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comus,</hi> principal Neſs or Promontory, King in <hi>Norway,</hi> beginning to reduce the Kingdom under him, made War upon the Inhabitants upward of 10 years, from the year of Chriſt 858 to 868, and having during that time put to death a part of thoſe little Kings and Princes, reduced a part of them under himſelf, driven another part out of the Land, and the laſt year, ſome Kings and principal men having made alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to reſiſt him, and raiſed a great Army, King <hi>Harold</hi> deſtroyed their Forces; after which time he found no more reſiſtance in <hi>Norway,</hi> and then ſaiih the Hiſtory, namely, the Chronicles of <hi>Norway page.</hi> 49, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deſert Lands were inhabited, which the men of <hi>Norway</hi> had begun to frequent before, <hi>Jempteland, Iſland, Grkeney, Hotland,</hi> and <hi>Feroe</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited; for many rich and oppulent
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:51993:118"/>
men fled from the Wars of <hi>Norway,</hi> becauſe of <hi>Harolds</hi> power, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other able men yeilded to <hi>Harold,</hi> and planted the Land with him; by which Hiſtory it is alſo in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner intimated, that <hi>Feroe</hi> was known to the people of <hi>Norway,</hi> and frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them; but then perfectly peopled and Inhabited; though there be a great uncertainty in Hiſtories written in ſuch obſcure times, for Mr. <hi>Peter Clauſon</hi> in his Deſcription of <hi>Norway, pag.</hi> 154. teacheth that in the ſixth year of King <hi>Harolds</hi> Reign, a Pirate called <hi>Madoder,</hi> ſailed from <hi>Norway</hi> intending ſor <hi>Feroe,</hi> but was driven by the Tempeſt under <hi>Iſland,</hi> which was then quite deſert, and was peopled ſince by King <hi>Harold Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chricomus's</hi> invitation and command, whence it appears that <hi>Feroe</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited before <hi>Iaſland;</hi> But the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſeems to ſet a general certain time for an uncertain. If thoſe Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Feroe</hi> had been as diligent to leave their Succeſſors ſome narration from the beginning, as thoſe of <hi>Iſland,</hi>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:51993:118"/>
one might now have had better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and it may be alſo they have not neglected it ſince there came no leſſer men to <hi>Feroe</hi> then to <hi>Iſland,</hi> but doubtleſs the Pirates have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them. It being certain that other documents which were kept in the publick Cheſt of the Country, were within theſe 100 years rob'd and carried away by ſuch men.</p>
            <p>The firſt that ſetled himſelf in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe</hi> was, they ſay, called <hi>Grimar Camban,</hi> which happened before thoſe that fled from <hi>Norway</hi> came thither, and wholly peopled the Land.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Grimar Camban</hi> was doubtleſs a Pirate or Sea Robber, Piracy being in thoſe days honourable. <hi>Hetland</hi> and <hi>Orheny</hi> being then but the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Sea-Robbers, and it being doubtleſs even ſo of <hi>Feroe;</hi> but in King <hi>Pulchricomus</hi> his time, in the 10 year of his Reign, many conſiderable men, with their Wives and Children, Goods and Moveables, took their habitation in <hi>Feroe,</hi> which was before diſcovered to them by <hi>Grimar Camban,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:51993:119"/>
firſt found the Land, gave it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo its name and called it <hi>Feroe:</hi> the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory mentioning, that <hi>Fero's</hi> Name was known in <hi>Norway,</hi> before they fled thither, and poſſeſſed it. There are ſeveral opinions concerning the derivation of this word <hi>Feroe;</hi> ſome think that the land hath that name from Sheep (called in Daniſh <hi>Faar)</hi> becauſe of the multitude of Sheep that is bred there, which is an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous opinion; <hi>Grimar Camban</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found no Sheep there at his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, neither hath it received its name ſince there have been Sheep planted there; for before the principal Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of people and Cattel went over thither, the Land had already its name. Beſides which, <hi>Faar</hi> is a Daniſh word, which is called in the old <hi>Norway</hi> Tongue, <hi>Saud,</hi> and in that of <hi>Feroe, Soid,</hi> others would deny their names from <hi>Feer</hi> or Feathers, which is alſo contrary to reaſon, for they little thought then of Feathers, and knew nothing of their uſe in commerce. Their Merchandiſe being for the moſt
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51993:119"/>
part Wool, as appears by the Hiſtory of <hi>Trunder</hi> of <hi>Gote</hi> in the 256 <hi>page</hi> of the Chronicle of <hi>Norway;</hi> who lived in <hi>Feroe</hi> 150 years after it was firſt inhabited, for he ſaid to his Brothers Sons <hi>Sigurd</hi> and <hi>Toerd</hi> the Sons of <hi>Torlack;</hi> there is a great difference in the age of a man, when I was young I did not lye on a Bench when it was good weather, as you doe; now the Ships lye on ground and rot under the hills, and the whole houſe is full of Wool, but none of you will carry it to the Market; if I had ſome years of my age back, things ſhould not go ſo. <hi>Torloft</hi> of <hi>Diemen</hi> is now a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Husband then you. <hi>Sigurd</hi> grew angry, ſtarted up and made himſelf ready, with his company of 12 men and ſailed out with <hi>Tarloff,</hi> and they came late at night to <hi>Norway;</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeareth firſt, only they have endeavoured to make mony of their wool. But ſecondly, that they have had their Trade in <hi>Norway,</hi> where Feathers were not in price; they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving themſelves Fowl enough on the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:51993:120"/>
North Coaſt of the Land, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was no thoughts of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to give the Country a name from thence, in the beginning; and ſo much the leſs becauſe neither they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves now, nor antiently ever uſed Beds filled with Feathers. Some will derive it from <hi>Far,</hi> it being a Land that lyeth far from <hi>Norway,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould be called <hi>Feroe;</hi> which is alſo doubtful, Iſland and <hi>Greenland</hi> lying yet at a further diſtance, and therefore ought with more reaſon to bear that name.</p>
            <p>I muſt add my opinion concerning the Etymology of that name, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the land may have taken its name from the Word to <hi>Fare,</hi> which is the ſame in the ancient Language of <hi>Feroe,</hi> as <hi>Ferrie</hi> in Engliſh, the ſame being alſo us'd in our old Daniſh; for places in <hi>Denmark,</hi> where one croſſeth from one ſhoar to the other in Boats or Ferries, are called Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry places, from ancient time to this preſent: and <hi>Feroe</hi> conſiſting of many Iſlands, where one not only muſt
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:51993:120"/>
croſs with Boats and Ferries, called in that Tongue <hi>Faevinger,</hi> from one Land to another, but one can alſo with ſuch Boats go along between the Iſlands; it ſeems probable that this qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the land may have given <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar Camban</hi> occaſion at his arrival to call theſe Iſlands <hi>Feroier,</hi> as they are called to this day in the language of <hi>Feroe,</hi> I leave herein nevertheleſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one to his own opinion; but the Iſlands being many, they ought to be called the <hi>Feroes,</hi> as they are <hi>Feroier</hi> by the Inhabitants, and in Latine <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roae,</hi> as the <hi>Oreades, Canaries,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Provinces that conſiſt of many Iſlands.</p>
            <p>Many principal men of <hi>Norway,</hi> as aboveſaid, having tranſplanted themſelves and their whole Families into <hi>Feroe,</hi> they divided the Iſlands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, every Chieftain appropriating to himſelf his Iſland, or more according to opportunity, where they afterwards ſubdivided the Land to be poſſeſt and till'd by their Servants, in the manner and places as
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:51993:121"/>
it is found to this day, moſt of the Chiefs having made the Country their properties and inheritance, not only thoſe places where they liv'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but alſo the other; ſo that the leaſt part remained to their Servants, whence it comes that <hi>Trundoff Jote</hi> in the 270 <hi>page</hi> of the Chronicle of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> calls the Inhabitants of the Eaſt, and North Iſlands, his Tenants, when he gave Tribute for himſelf and them to <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Myrske</hi> or <hi>Tender,</hi> ſent thither by King <hi>Oluff</hi> the Holy, whence many old Folks can yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late that a part of their predeceſſors were very rich in Lands, ſo that they have poſſeſt above the half part of <hi>Suderoe,</hi> this that great Village, and the other, many Encloſures; but now there is nothing of ſuch glorious riches to be ſeen, for ſome of them having been a cruel people, did forfeit their poſſeſſions to the King, by committing Murthers and other miſdeeds, as one might prove by example, almoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the remembrance of man: ſome in the Popiſh times forfeited their eſtates
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:51993:121"/>
to the Biſhops for eating of fleſh, as many can yet relate; for the Biſhops forbad their hearers to eat fleſh in Lent, and they being us d thereunto and deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What Lands the owners did keep; have ſince been divided by their heirs in ſo many ſmall parcels, that they cannot live thereof; ſo that it ſeems, thoſe that were in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the richeſt and moſt powerful, are now grown the pooreſt and moſt indigent of the Country; for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:51993:122"/>
born to Land, as they call them, or freeholders, are the pooreſt people; thoſe that poſſeſs the Kings Lands being the principalleſt and richeſt men. Here are nevertheleſs found ſome noble mens Lands, as the <hi>Benckeſtockers,</hi> the <hi>Reſencranthel,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Adeluzies,</hi> whether they are come to them by inheritance of theſe Chiefetaines, or they have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed them is uncertain. Here are alſo certain Lands called <hi>Rytter's</hi> Lands that were purchaſed here in the Country by one <hi>Mathias Rytter.</hi> It ſeems nevertheleſs, that ſome of the Nobles Lands are poſſeſſions bought of others, there being ſome that rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon themſelves born heirs thereunto. The ſaid chiefs of the Land enjoy'd the Government of <hi>Feroe</hi> till they were reduced by the Kings of <hi>Norway:</hi> There is nothing found in Hiſtory of their orderly ſucceſſion; the firſt that is read of being <hi>Trund</hi> of <hi>Gote,</hi> who was an old Chiefetaine during the Reign of ſome Kings, ruling over the North and Eaſtern Iſlands. Thoſe
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:51993:122"/>
that were Rulers with him were <hi>Breſte</hi> and <hi>Beine,</hi> two Brothers, and Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Trund,</hi> that governed other Iſlands.</p>
            <p>It is poſſible they may have been the firſt Chiefs that have both taken the Land in poſſeſſion and governed it, or elſe their next ſucceſſors; ſince they liv'd in <hi>Harald Greybeards</hi> time; for they liv'd then long in the Land, as ſome do yet. But the aforeſaid <hi>Trund,</hi> being an infamous bad and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful man, cauſed his Couſins and Fellow Rulers, <hi>Breaſte</hi> and <hi>Berne</hi> to be treacherouſly kill'd, that he alone might have the Supreme Government. In the mean time he took to himſelf their Sons <hi>Sigiſmund, Breaſte's</hi> Son, and <hi>Torgild, Berne's</hi> Son, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuce of breeding them up, but ſold them afterwards privately as two Slaves out of the Country, (of whoſe remarkable Hiſtory we will hereafter make further mention) and ſo he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the Country alone, till the time of King <hi>Oluff Tryggeſon.</hi> That <hi>Sigiſmund, Breastes</hi> Son, came again

It is not known who ſucceeded them afterwards; though the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try hath a long time after had its own Governours. Though the Inhabitants have not been very powerful to reſiſt the mighty abſolute King of <hi>Norway,</hi> they kept nevertheleſs their liberties under theſe their chiefetains, by reaſon of the great diviſion and civil war between the Sons of <hi>Harald Pulchrycomus,</hi> and their Succeſſors, ſpecially between the Sons of <hi>Erick</hi>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:51993:123"/>
               <hi>Softear,</hi> and <hi>Hagan Jarle</hi> the good, that reduc'd the whole Kingdom of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> to his obedience, till King <hi>Oluff Harald</hi> Son the Holy's time, who took care not only to amplifie the Kingdom of Chriſt, but alſo his own; wherefore he undertook to reduce the <hi>Feroes</hi> under his obedience; but he durſt not venture to do it by force, fearing it may be the courage of the Inhabitors, as alſo the dangerous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the places: wherefore he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to do it by good deeds, and made many friends in <hi>Feroe,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they gave themſelves under his power. But putting afterwards bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens upon them, whereunto they were not accuſtomed, they fell off from him preſently again, wherefore the King ſent a meſſage to <hi>Feroe,</hi> that the beſt men of the Land ſhould come to him in <hi>Norway; Gille</hi> the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Judge, <hi>Lieffe Aſſerſon, Torrulff</hi> of great <hi>Diemen,</hi> and many other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymens Sons made themſelves ready to go into <hi>Norway,</hi> but that cunning Fox <hi>Trund</hi> of <hi>Gote</hi> pretended ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51993:124"/>
and went not with them. When all theſe came to the King, they were obliged to take their oath they would remain his ſubjects, and promiſed they would ſend him a Tribute, and that the Folks of the Land ſhould be his Subjects. And the King made them gifts and preſents, and diſmiſſed them bountifully; which the courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader can find more largely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in the Chronicle of <hi>Norway, pag.</hi> 246, 247, 248, &amp;c. But what loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty the Inhabitants intended to have, for King <hi>Oluff</hi> appeared in time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently afterwards, ſee the Chronicle of <hi>Norway, pag.</hi> 249. for when the King ſent a Ship to <hi>Feroe</hi> to fetch his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, the Ship was loſt; ſo that he could never come certainly to know what was become of the Ship or men. But having the next year had ſome relation that they were loſt at Sea, he ſent again another Ship with men, but it happened to them in the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and there were many opinions what might be become of the Kings Ships, for in the Chronicle of <hi>Norway,</hi>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:51993:124"/>
               <hi>pag.</hi> 268. King <hi>Oluff</hi> keeping often his Court with his Chiefs in <hi>Sundmor,</hi> gave out that he would ſend to fetch from <hi>Feroe</hi> the Tribute which they had promiſed him, complaining for the men he had loſt on that Voyage, and named out ſome men, that ſhould Sail thither; but they ſaid all nay, and refuſed to undertake the voyage.</p>
            <p>Then roſe up a great man well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, having a red Coat on, a Helmet on his Head, his Loins girt with a Sword and a great Halbert in his hand ſaying, you have a good King, but your ſelves are cowardly men, that you dare refuſe the voyage which he commands you, having received ſo much honour and benefit of him. I have not hitherto been the Kings Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, neither hath he been a gracious Lord unto me, but I will now proffer my ſelf to go to <hi>Feroe,</hi> if there be no other remedy. The King asked who he was, and what was his name, that anſwered him ſo undauntedly? for he knew him not; The man anſwered, my name is not conſiderable, though I
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:51993:125"/>
think you have heard it named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; I am called <hi>Charles the Tender.</hi> The King anſwared, it is true, <hi>Charles,</hi> that I have heard thy name before, and a time hath been, that if we had met, thou ſhouldſt not have carried the news of it abroad; but I will pardon thee altogether, ſince thou wilt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this voyage for me, and thou ſhalt be my gueſt to day, that we may ſpeak further about it.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Charles</hi> (ſee the Chronicle of <hi>Norway<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pag.</hi> 269) had been a cruell Robber by Sea and Land, and the King had often ſent out his men to kill him, but he eſcaped always; he was of a great Family, and very cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, valiant, and expert in all things: he made himſelf ready for his Voyage to <hi>Feroe,</hi> and had about 20 men with him; he got a good wind, and when he came to <hi>Feroe</hi> he arrived at <hi>Thors haven</hi> in <hi>Stremoe,</hi> and let ſummon, all the people to a Court. There came <hi>Trund</hi> of <hi>Gote</hi> with many Folks, as alſo <hi>Leiff Aſerſon,</hi> and <hi>Gille</hi> the Provincial Judge, the Kings ſworn
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:51993:125"/>
men, with many people. When they had pitched their Tents, they came to <hi>Charles</hi> and embraced him; <hi>Charles</hi> ſaluted them from the King, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded then his friendly commands, to raiſe and pay in the Tribute, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them a token from the King; they promiſed to promote his errand amongſt the people, and to give him their beſt aſſiſtance. Then came <hi>Trund</hi> of <hi>Gote</hi> (that baſe Traitor) and Saluted <hi>Charles,</hi> inviting him to a winters meal; <hi>Charles</hi> excus'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, becauſe he had taken his lodgings by <hi>Leiff Aſerſon,</hi> but he deſired that <hi>Trund</hi> would gather the Tribute of the Eaſt and Northern Iſlands; <hi>Trund</hi> promiſed he would do ſo.

Tribute he had gathered; he could not come out to them by reaſon of the weakneſs of his ſight, wherefore <hi>Leiff</hi> went into him in his black Tent, and <hi>Trund</hi> gave him a bag with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which he carried out to <hi>Charles,</hi> and caſt the mony in his Shield, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them about; and <hi>Leiff</hi> ask'd <hi>Charles</hi> what he thought of it? who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, I believe that all the falſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that could be found in the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Iſlands is come hither. <hi>Trund</hi> heard this, and asked <hi>Leiff</hi> if it was not good Silver? <hi>Leiff</hi> ſaid it was falſe mony, <hi>Trund</hi> put the fault upon his Servant that had gathered the Tribute, whileſt he was himſelf ſick. <hi>Leiff</hi> went in and took another purſe of mony from him for <hi>Charles,</hi> and when they viewed them they were neither ſo good that <hi>Leiff</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them for the Kings Tribute. <hi>Trund's</hi> Couſin <hi>Gautt</hi> the Red, aroſe on the Bench whereon he laid, and ſaid, it is an old Proverb, The older a man grows the worſe he is.

               <hi>Charles the Tender</hi> to ſearch in thy mony ſo often this day. <hi>Trund</hi> ſprung up and was angry at <hi>Gaute's</hi> words, and bad <hi>Leiff</hi> come in and take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bag, ſaying, my own Tenants have brought me this, though I can ſee little, yet the Shirt is nearer then the Doublet; and he deſired <hi>Leiff</hi> to go out to <hi>Charles</hi> and weigh the mony for him, for he could not be preſent himſelf. <hi>Leiff</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> went out into the Fields, and all their Folks were in arms, as if they had gone to a war. <hi>Charles</hi> took his Helmet from his head, and caſt the mony in it, and they found 'twas good Silver, but as they were ſitting, they ſaw a man co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to them that had a Pole Ax in his hand, this was <hi>Gaute</hi> the Red; he ſtuck his Pole Ax in the ground, and ſaid, have a care thou Tender <hi>Charles</hi> thou doeſt not get a miſchief to day of my Pole Ax; there came at the very ſame time a man running, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to <hi>Leiff Aſerſon,</hi> and deſiring him to come ſtraight ways to <hi>Gills</hi> the Provincial Judges Tent; for there

For as this Biſhop <hi>Roar</hi> is not found in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of <hi>Norway</hi> amongſt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Feroe,</hi> in the Catalogue, and the Hiſtorian hath neither mentioned that this Biſhop was the firſt, nor when or by whom he was eſtabliſhed, ſo the Author hath neither cared for, when <hi>Feroe</hi> was laid under the Crown of <hi>Norway,</hi> as a thing which did not properly belong to the ſcope of his Treatiſe. <hi>Feroe</hi> having ever ſince the time mentioned been a Province ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Kingdom of <hi>Norway,</hi> it hath not only happened, that the principal men thereof, as Members of that Kingdom, have been made uſe of in buſineſſes of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as we read in the Chronicle of <hi>Norway, pag</hi> 635. that in King <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen Hagenſens</hi> time, who was King <hi>Suerres</hi> Grandchild, <hi>Swerke</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Feroe</hi> was with others in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the States in the year of Chriſt 1223. when King <hi>Hagen Hagenſon</hi> was by all the States ſworn and jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

            <p>There is a great errour in the date thereof, mentioning it to be given at <hi>Opſlo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Firſt, it is mentioned in the Sheep Ordinance, that it was <hi>Hagen</hi> Duke of <hi>Norway,</hi> King <hi>Magnus</hi> the Crowned Son that gave it out; and there is found no King <hi>Magnas</hi> before then, till the time of King <hi>Magnus Oluffſon.</hi> The firſt King <hi>Magnus</hi> that was Crowned, was King <hi>Magnus Erlingſon,</hi> who reigned in the year
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:51993:130"/>
of Chriſt 1164. and had one Son cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Hagen,</hi> neither did any of his Children rule in <hi>Norway,</hi> being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf kill'd by <hi>Suerre,</hi> and all his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny driven out and deſtroyed. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, there is named in the Sheep-Ordinance, Biſhop <hi>Erlander,</hi> who in the Catalogue of the Biſhops of <hi>Feroe,</hi> is the third after <hi>Suerquire,</hi> of whom is ſaid above, that he was in the year 1223. in the general Aſſembly of the States, whence it plainly appeareth, that there is a great errour in the time it was given out.</p>
            <p>But that we may come to ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty about the date of this Sheep-Ordinance, we find in Hiſtory that King <hi>Magnus Hagenſon Lagebetter,</hi> who Reigned over <hi>Norway</hi> in the year 1263. had two Sons, <hi>Erick</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen; Erick</hi> became King after his Father, and was called <hi>Erick</hi> Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hater, who reigned 19 years, and died in the year 1299. In this King <hi>Ericks</hi> 19 years reign, his Brother <hi>Hagen</hi> was as a Duke in <hi>Norway,</hi> though Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory doth not ſpeak plainly of it;
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:51993:130"/>
yet it can be eaſily concluded by the circumſtances; for antiently, ſince the time of <hi>Harolds Pulchricomus,</hi> the Kings of <hi>Norway</hi>'s Sons were called Graves or Earls; but <hi>Hagen Hagen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> the Father of King <hi>Magnus</hi> the Crowned, brought firſt the Title of Duke over into <hi>Norway;</hi> making his Queen's Father, who was before an Earl or Count, to be a Duke. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the Title of Duke was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver given to the Kings Sons; whence it appeareth that this Sheep Ordinance was given out in the 19 year of that Duke, when his Brother <hi>Erick</hi> dyed, and he became King; that is in the year 1299.</p>
            <p>The circumſtances of Hiſtory does much confirm this opinion in other manner, for as Duke <hi>Hagen</hi> calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for Honors ſake, the ſon of King <hi>Magnus</hi> the Crowned, ſo there are none of the former Kings ſo remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by their Coronation as this King <hi>Magnus,</hi> who was Crowned during his Fathers Life, without any contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, but rather with the deſire of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:51993:131"/>
all; which never happened before: for which reaſon it may be, he was called King <hi>Magnus</hi> the Crowned. This King <hi>Magnus</hi> bettered the Law, wherefore he was called Law-better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. He writ alſo a particular law for thoſe of <hi>Iſland,</hi> as alſo the Ordinance of Chriſtianity, which was ſent over to thoſe of <hi>Feroe;</hi> whereupon it ſeems they found ſomething to complain of, as appeareth by the Proeme to the Sheep-Ordinance, of which it ſeems thoſe of <hi>Feroe</hi> took then occaſion to deſire of his Son that particular ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance concerning Sheep; much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour being uſed therein, which had in that long ſpace crept amongſt the commonalty; of which law we will further ſpeak in the ſixth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when we treat of their Policy.</p>
            <p>This ordinance concerning Sheep was confirmed by <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the IV. King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> of happy Memory, and Printed upon the humble deſires of the Inhabitants of <hi>Feroe,</hi> though this fault was left uncorrected; but this muſt be imputed to the ſimple
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:51993:131"/>
negligence of the Inhabitants, who have had a Copy of that Law, kept by them during ſo long time, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal having been robb'd away.</p>
            <p>As they have received Laws and particular ordinances from the Kings of <hi>Norway,</hi> ſo they have from time to time ſworn Allegiance to the ſaid Kings; for one readeth in the Chron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icle of <hi>Norway, pag.</hi> 707. that in the year of Chriſt 1240. the Inhabitants of <hi>Norway.

               <hi>Iſland,</hi> and <hi>Feroe.</hi> There are many recitals of his courage and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant actions, he was not only bold and couragious to meet his enemies, but alſo intelligent to deviſe cunning Stratagems againſt them, when they were too ſtrong for him.</p>
            <p>For it happened once that a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Pyrate, with a well rigged Ship came under <hi>Norway,</hi> and caſt Anchor neer <hi>Valdhowe;</hi> whereof <hi>Magnus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advertiſed, and having cauſed the Ship to be eſpied, found that he was not able to fight her openly, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore invented this ſtratagem; he cloathed himſelf in a Peaſants cloaths, got a Fiſher Boat, and provided him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with old Nailes, Lead, Leather, a melting ſpoon, and a tinder Box, which he hid all under his Nets and Ropes in the Boat: being then come from the Land, and having taken pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty many Fiſhes, he rowed to the Ship, and whileſt he ſold them Fiſh, knew ſo well to counterfeit a groſs ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they had no ſuſpition of his ſtay, but it was a pleaſure to them;
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:51993:141"/>
which when he perceived, he deſired leave of the Captain to faſten his Boat at the Sterne of the Ship, pretending that he uſed often, by reaſon of his poverty, to lye out at Sea in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. The Captain having granted his requeſt, he faſtened his Boat neer the Rudder. The Watch that was ſet at night took little care of what was done at Sterne of the Ship, and had no ſuſpition of ſuch a fellow: wherefore when <hi>Magnus</hi> perceived that every body was at quiet, he thruſt as many Nailes as could go into the holes of the Rudder, he cluſtered them with Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther underneath, then ſtruck fire, mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Lead, and poured it into the holes of the Rudder. Having now done all this without being perceived by the Watch, he retired in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own Ship, and made all things ready for fighting, Weighed Anchor and put to Sea, ſailing againſt the Pyrate and engaging him to fight, but he not being able to govern his Ship, the Rudder being faſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, he was eaſily and without
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:51993:141"/>
any great reſiſtance overcome, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Priſoner by <hi>Magnus Heinſon.</hi> Whereas <hi>Magnus Heinſ n</hi> did ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly endeavour to ruine theſe Sea-Robbers both by ſubtile devices, as well as by force, he deſtroy'd many of them, and his name grew famous abroad; wherefore theſe Pirates did proſecute <hi>Magnus</hi> again, and made all their endeavours to ſurprize him with advantage. A Sea Robber having had notice that he lay ſecure in <hi>Thors-haven</hi> in <hi>Feroe,</hi> he did ſeek him there, which <hi>Magnus</hi> perceiving hid all his digging, and took flight upon <hi>Heſtoe;</hi> the enemy having heard of it, purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him thither; but <hi>Magnus</hi> had ſo provided himſelf aforehand with ſtones, which he rowled upon them, that he drove them all away, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to retire to their Ship again, and put to Sea.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Magnus,</hi> that he might be free afterwards for ſuch unexpected ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes of the enemy, raiſed a Sconce near <hi>Thors haven,</hi> which is yet to be ſeen; repaired ſo his Ship, manning
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:51993:142"/>
her as well as poſſible, and put to Sea again to revenge himſelf upon his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy: at laſt he heard that he was in <hi>Norway,</hi> and knowing that he was not ſtrong enough to fight him, he ſought to ſurprize him; commanding his Folks to lye in Boats in an off ſide from the Ship; he took a number of Stones with him and came on board the Pirate; who not knowing him took him for a ſimple Peaſant. <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> carried himſelf now as before, with his cunning folly, and a good while made the people merry on the Deck, till at laſt feigning as if he had been drunk with their Beer, he begun to try whether he could climb up the Main-maſt; carrying himſelf very ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in his tryals, as if he had not known what they called the Maſt, or what it ſerved them to; he did thus ſo long with them till he got up into the Maſt quarter, and then preſently with a Dagger which he had hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under his clothes, cut off the Sail Ropes, and with the Stones which he had about him, drove the people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

            <p>
               <hi>Magnus,</hi> as many more was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing enclined to drunkenneſs, whence it happened once, whileſt he lay here in a Harbour of <hi>Feroe,</hi> being gone to Land, where he drank hard with all his men, ſo that he fell aſleep, and lay that night on Shoar, that in the mean time a Pirate came into the Harbour, and having notice where <hi>Magnus</hi> was, they came ſubtilly to him and took him Priſoner, whileſt he was aſleep, amongſt all his men, and carried him on board, though they afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed him on this condition, that he ſhould ſwear and promiſe never to perſecute them more. <hi>Magnus</hi> being at liberty did not think himſelf obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to obſerve any forced Oath, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to revenge the ſhame they had put upon him, as well as to curb their unjuſt Piracy, which they then
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:51993:143"/>
exerciſed every where about this Country, without any fear thinking themſelves in ſecurity by reaſon of <hi>Magnus Heineſon</hi>'s obligation; he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with theſe impious men, and in a ſhort fight overcame and took them Priſoners. In ſuch manner was the fear of <hi>Magnus</hi> come upon his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that they durſt not kill him when they had him Priſoner, and thought themſelves free of all danger if they were but in ſecurity of him. The courage and valour of <hi>Magnus</hi> was ſo great, that not only he did not avoid danger, by engaging often with more powerful men then himſelf, and happily overcoming them: but they neither failed him in his greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for once the moſt part of his own folks, conſiſting of ſeveral Nations, having conſpired together to kill him, and run away with his Ship; he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in a fury maſtered 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of them, and drove ſuch a fear in the reſt, that they let fall their feracity, and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves.</p>
            <p>And as he was couragious, ſo was
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:51993:143"/>
ever fortune on his ſide, it happening uſually that Fortune helpeth a Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant man, but luck is inconſtant and often changed. It happened even ſo unto <hi>Magnus</hi> for he was again by force overcome and taken Priſoner, but his great courage did never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, for being ask'd by him, that had taken him, what his mind was then; he anſwered without any ſign of fear, if I had power over thee, as thou haſt over me, I would make thee ſuffer the cruelleſt Death that I could invent. Whereupon his Victor ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Heroical courage, gave him his liberty, without being deſired; and <hi>Magnus</hi> kept this courage till the hour of his death; for when, as will be ſaid hereafter, he was forced, though for an innocent cauſe, to ſtretch his neck to the Executioner, in the place before the Kings Palace, and the Executioner ask'd him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would have a handkerchiefe tyed before his eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as is uſual, he anſwered no, ſaying moreover to the Executioner, I have ſeen ſo many

drawn Swords without fear, have thou but a care thou beeſt not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid.</p>
            <p>Thus by his Fortune and valour he came greatly in the favour of the aforeſaid King <hi>Frederick</hi> the II. of Glorious memory, who not only made conſtant uſe of him in ſeveral ſuch expeditions, but alſo becauſe of his great experience in the North Sea, ſent him to diſcover <hi>Greenland,</hi> in the year 1577. and it is thought he was the firſt ſubject of <hi>Denmark</hi> that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to find out <hi>Greenland.</hi> He ſet his courſe according to old Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, directly for <hi>Iſland,</hi> and from thence again till he perceived the Mountain <hi>White Serk,</hi> where he met with a great deal of Fog and bad wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with much driving ice, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he got ſight of the Land, but could not come thereunto; neither ſeemed it he could come from the place where he was, though he had a good wind, by reaſon of the Loadſtone, which he believed to be at the bottome of the Sea, and hindred his voyage: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:51993:144"/>
the days growing ſhort, he was obliged without performing what he went for, to return for <hi>Denmark.</hi>

            <p>By reaſon of <hi>Magnus Heineſon</hi>'s expeditions, his name grew famous in the neighbouring Countreys and Kingdoms; many loved him, many feared him, and many alſo hated him. He found likewiſe envious men in <hi>Denmark;</hi> It happening often, that vertue is not without envy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution: yet they could not hurt him as long as the good King <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> lived; but after his deceaſe, this brave Sea Captain was forced to yield his neck to the Sword, which many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies could not obtain by their force; for it happened in the year, 1588, during the Minority of King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the IV. of Glorious Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the ſaid <hi>Magnus Heineſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:51993:145"/>
to be buried in St. <hi>Nicholas</hi>'s Chur ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.</p>
            <p>But God, as a juſt Judge, made his Innocence appear, appointing for that purpoſe the Right Honourable <hi>John Lindenow,</hi> Lord of <hi>Olſloffe,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Judge of <hi>North Jutland,</hi> who concern'd himſelf in <hi>Magnus Heine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> innocent cauſe and execution; and by a lawful ſuit and ſentence vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated him, at the General Seſſions held at <hi>Kolding,</hi> in the year 1590. the 6. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> out of S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> Churh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, whence he was with pomp tranſported from <hi>Copenhagen</hi> into <hi>Jut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and Buried in <hi>Olſloffe</hi> Church, near <hi>Viburg;</hi> his Valour having been very renowned in this Kingdom, where he had Married a Lady of Noble Parentage, and for the falſe accuſation, for which he loſt his life, there was given 3000, Rix Dollars, by friendly reconciliation and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

            <p>Beſides theſe two, there have been none of <hi>Feroe</hi> that by valiant actions have left any famous name to poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;

having from the beginning ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed themſelves to a quiet courſe of life, contented with their poverty; by which long tranquallity they have loſt their old Heatheniſh ferocity and vigour, though they have continually been troubled by <hi>French, Iriſh,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pyrates: but their means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in Lands, Cattle, and Wild Sheep; whereupon the enemy could do little damage, they ever ſaved themſelves on the high Rocks.

Such ſort of people have exerciſed great violence againſt the poor Inhabitants of this Country, there paſſing formerly ſcarce any year, but they were troubled by them.</p>

hath the Turk forgotten it; for in the year 1629. there came two Turkiſh Ships into <hi>Suderoe,</hi> that dealt very cruelly in the Countrey, taking away without exception, whoſoever came before them. It happened the ſame time, that the Prieſt of that place, called Mr. <hi>Paul Eraſmuſon,</hi> fled upon a Rock with a little child; the Turks purſued him, and took firſt the Child, which he had laid down, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards purſued the Prieſt, wherefore he leaped down from a very high pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory, under which many people had hidden themſelves from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and God made it come to paſs ſo wonderfully that he ſtopped upon a Turffe of Earth that was ſoft and well overgrown with Graſs, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round about nothing but Clifts and Stones; yet, though his body was not endamaged, his mind was never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs very much diſtracted by that high fall. Wherefore his Majeſty of <hi>Denmark,</hi> King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the IV. rig'd out a Ship commanded by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>George Daa,</hi> who likewiſe
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:51993:149"/>
did his utmoſt to deſtroy ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Thieves. Amongſt other, he ſurpriz'd an Iriſh Pyrate, in <hi>Weſtmans-haven</hi> in <hi>Stremoe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A part of the Pyrates crew run pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently over the Land, and took one of the Inhabitants Boats, wherewith they fled from <hi>Feroe</hi> to <hi>Hetland;</hi> thoſe that were left<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>behind were taken and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. After the ſaid <hi>Daa,</hi> his ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty commanded other Ships to cruiſe under <hi>Feroe,</hi> which harboured uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Skaale fiord</hi> in <hi>Osteroe;</hi> whence it is, that the harbour hath gotten the name of <hi>Kings haven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there going more charges year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fit out ſuch Ships then the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, which the King received of the Land, could import; King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the IV. was pleaſed to cauſe to build a Fort in <hi>Thors-haven,</hi> againſt the unexpected invaſion of all enemies. There being not only kept the Kings contributions, but alſo all Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize for the maintenance of the whole Country; which was done after the Turks falling into <hi>Suderoe;</hi> and ſince
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:51993:150"/>
that time, they have in ſome manner been free from ſuch Sea-robbers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when there hath been war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Denmark</hi> and the neighbouring Kingdoms, for t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>n, as is probable, they have often been diſturb'd by neighbouring enemies.</p>
            <p>It is not heard or read, of any civil war, or inward tumult in <hi>Feroe,</hi> as in <hi>Iſland,</hi> though there be an old tale of ſome troubles in the Country, and there hath been ſhewed me a valley in <hi>Calſoe,</hi> above the village of <hi>Migle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,</hi> where two armies of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants have fought together, and two hills under which they ſay, the dead are buried; though they know not the true ground thereof. I am almoſt of opinion, that this happened in the time of King <hi>Ingi Baard's</hi> ſon, in the year of Chriſt 1211. by <hi>Erling Suerri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> of whom the Hyſtory of <hi>Norway, pag.</hi> 581. maketh mention in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

in the Iſlands with ſome gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red men, doing great violence and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; he had 7 Children, and went ſince for <hi>Norway</hi> in the Ship of <hi>Einar</hi> the Sheriff; ren <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ring himſelf to <hi>Philip</hi> and the Lady <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> ſhe received him very well, and acknowledged him for her Brother, he dyed ſome years after of an effuſion of blood, after blood letting. It may be, that he, as an heir to the Crown of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> would reduce <hi>Feroe</hi> to obedience, but that he was diſcomſited and forc'd to go out of the Country to ſeek the aſſiſtance of his Siſter <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> and that his deſign vaniſhed by his death. Here is alſo ſpoken of another uproar that happened for a good while ſince, by ſome few that gathered themſelves together, and would poſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of <hi>Feroe,</hi> putting to death all thoſe that would not be of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which company they call to this day the Flock men, from their thus flocking and being gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Inhabitants of <hi>Feroe</hi> having thus continually been, as well free
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:51993:151"/>
from civil, as from foreign wars, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what oppreſſion the Sea-robbers and thoſe of their party did them; they have during their long tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty taken great care to cultivate the ground, having not only till'd, Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, aud built the places that are now inhabited, but other places beſides, that are now left untill'd, and are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome renewed.</p>
            <p>They devide the ground which they till, into acres; the acre being ſubdivided into ells, ſo that by an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre of ground is underſtood 320 <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> Ells four ſquare; whereunto belongeth alſo a part of the ground that is without the Incloſure; yet there is a great difference in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the diviſions, though every a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre of Land be reckoned for 320 ells. And the Acres conſiſting in that ſort of meaſure, the poor free-holders know to divide it after their deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Parents in many ſmall parts, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in 80, 60, 40, 20, and 10 ells, and an acre of ground coſting, according to the ancient price of Land, ſixteen
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:51993:151"/>
Gylders of <hi>Feroe,</hi> they call uſually ſuch ſmall parts a Gylder, namely 80 Ells about 4 Gylders, 40 Ells 2 Gyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſo forth, till it comes to be ſo little that it amounteth but to five Skins of earth, which is Land for 10 pence. This diviſion being very da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mageable to the Country, for it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth many poor people; they do not plow their ground, but dig it, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king deep furrows laing the earth, which they dig out of them, on the ground cloſe together, the dung be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid under it before. Neither is each Field above 3 ells broad, uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a ridge on the one ſide, that water may always have its fall into the furrow, and continually flow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, there falling here very much rain; afterwards they break the Earth that was laid over, with a ſpade inſtead of harrowing it; and when they have ſowed their Seed, they clap the earth over with flat pieces of Wood; inſtead of rowling it over. So that they have a great deal of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:51993:152"/>
and pain in the Tillage of their ground, which cannot otherwiſe be, becauſe of the Lands propriety. The ground which they thus Till, they let reſt 8 or 10 years, for it will not bear fruit every year; but in the mean time it yields excellent Graſs for Hay, which they only mow, and not that which groweth in Mooriſh grounds, as they do in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys.</p>
            <p>As they have a great deal of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the Tillage of their ground, ſo they have no leſs about their Corn; for they cut it off with an ordinary Knife, and puck every Ear from the Straw, drying them afterwards in a Kilne; the Corn not coming here to perfect Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Afterwards, inſtead of Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, Women tread the Ears of Corn with their bare feet; all this labour about their Corn ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up a great deal of time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unprofitably; which might well be remedied, but they are ſo
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:51993:152"/>
minded in general, that they will not change their old cuſtomes no more in this then in many other things.</p>

For they are humble in their Converſation, civil in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and courteous in their ſpeech; ſpecially towards ſtrangers, and thoſe that are better then themſelves: they are ſerviceable, obedient, willing, and liberal to their Magiſtrates; and thoſe of <hi>Feroe</hi> muſt be praiſed above many other Nations in this, that a ſtranger travelling through the Land, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is well received by them, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the beſt they have, without paying any thing; but alſo, when they depart, if the Hoſt is able, are gratified with a preſent, and beſides helped with free carriage to the next habitation; which happeneth here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not ſo ordinary for ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers

to travel over the Land, as in other Countrey<hi>s;</hi> for if it were ſo, they would be obliged to become of the ſame mind as others. They are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itable to the poor and needy, for there being here many that poſſeſs no lands, living only of their fiſhing; when they ſheare Sheep in Summer, they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to beg wool, and they give them as they are able, yea ſome more then they are able, to their own damage; for none would willingly have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of niggardneſs, whence it comes, that the poor Countrymen of the villages live near as well, as thoſe that live on the Kings Farms; ſo that they are almoſt all equally rich in mony; only the Farmer hath his Sheep and Cattle more then the other, and therefore here liveth generally a poor people, poor indeed in Gold, but rich in the grace of God.</p>
            <p>By reaſon of ſuch liberality and charity, this people have deſpiſed ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and loved poverty; very few having ever cared to lay aſide any mony or other neceſſaries againſt a

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:51993:155"/>
and Silver there is found in that a great faithfulneſs amongſt them all; for if one of <hi>Feroe</hi> cometh in an able mans Kitchin, and findeth there Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Pewter, and Horn Spoons, and hath a mind to ſteal, he'l let the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Spoons alone, and will rather take thoſe of Pewter or Horn; he taketh rather the Pewter Spoons, becauſe he can melt it and make thereof Ilet Rings for womens bodies, but dares not touch Silver or Gold, becauſe he knows not how to alter or change it.</p>

and was govern'd by principal men or Chieſetains: as alſo in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how, when the Country came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Kings of <hi>Norway,</hi> there were conſtituted Biſhops and Sheriffs over the Nation, beſides the Kings Bayliff, that gathered Taxes and contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Since the time of Reformation, we know not that this land hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a government or Diſtrict, wherewith the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s Miniſters have been intr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Temporal Juſtice is twofold, particular and general; The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar is yearly rendred in every diviſion, and it is the ſame thing as the Diſtricts court or firſt inſtance in <hi>Denmark,</hi> and is called the Spring Seſſions, for there being not ſo many controverſies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Inhabitants here, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, it is kept but once a year, namely, in the Spring, whence it hath the name of Spring-Seſſion; where it is the charge of the Sheriff to preſide, and of the Sworn Recorder to judge; what cauſes they cannot decide, or do it wrongfully, are appealed of to the law ſeſſions, which is the general

The firſt day they ſit, all the Prieſts are called together, and when the Court is ſate, there is only conſidered that day of what concerns the common good in general; and all cauſes and other controverſies being the other days brought to an end, and the Court being then ready to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, the Clergy is called again into

                  <p>The Reader may take notice of the fault that is found in the date of this Sheep Ordinance in our 4th.

For one would think, according to the Law of Nature he ought to be a diſhoneſt man, that marketh Sheep worth more then an Orte; for the greater a fault is, ſo much the greater ought to be the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; but this errour is proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the long kept Sheep Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in writing, that was put out in Print, without being altered.</p>
                  <p>Concerning Mulcts or Fines, they are much greater in regard of the worth in <hi>Feroe,</hi> then in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys or Provinces lying under the Crowns of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> the higheſt Mulct in the law of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> being but 40 marks; King <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>

                     <hi>Hagenſon</hi> of <hi>Norway</hi> mitigated his Law and gave away the two parts of theſe 40 marks; whence it comes that the greateſt Mulct, namely, 8 Ones and 13 marks, in the Law of <hi>Norway</hi> is but a third part of 40 Marks.

And that this Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly might not be prejudicial to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, there was a certain Tax laid upon all Merchandiſe uſually brought hither, and ſold, namely a Tun of Barley for two Gilders, of

is uſually a pretty cold and moiſt air, which uſually cauſeth the Scurvy to thoſe that lead a ſolitary life, and this hath a great affinity with Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy. Beſides the meat of all, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the poorer ſort, is half rotten fleſh or fiſh all their nouriſhment in Summer being likewiſe freſh fiſh and ſweet Milk, without any Salt; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that is not of a ſtrong and good complexion, may eaſily have his blood corrupted, the ſickneſs gnawing then it ſelf throught he body, before it breaketh out, and when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one is ſo infected he may eaſily give it to another, that is of the ſame complexion with the ſick. Now that Diſeaſe acting a great while in a man, before it breaketh out, it hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peneth that many that think they be clean on both ſides, do marry toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and yet afterwards the one is found to be infected. God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deals wonderfully with ſuch people in their marriage, for amongſt the children they beget, ſome clean and ſome unclean. I have 3 exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:51993:181"/>
in my Pariſh of Women that have been unclean, and have brought forth many Children, whereof moſt are married, none of them being yet found to be unclean; wherefore the Inhabitants take but little care in their woing, whether their Parents have been clean or no. I have alſo an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that the Father hath been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, and yet the Children health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. It has alſo been taken notice of, that two living together in Marriage, though the one be found infected, they live together as before, as long as one doth but murmur of it, till the Magiſtrate doth ſeparate them, and yet the ſound remaineth uninfected, whereas another is often taken with the Diſeaſe by a very little conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Here are examples yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, that poor Cripples, clean but helpleſs, have been put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſick in the Hoſpital, eat with them, converſe dayly with them, and are not infected in the whole time of their lives; what is this? but that God confirms the truth of his word,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:51993:182"/>
taking pleaſure in them that live in a juſt Wedlock, and wander in Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ways, putting their hopes in him, that neither fire nor Water, contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſeaſe, nor dangerous Peſtilence ſhall hurt them.</p>

Grace, when the word of God was Preached in <hi>Denmark,</hi> did ſend <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmund Broſteſon,</hi> a man of <hi>Fero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> (of whom is ſaid before, that the King cauſed him to be Baptized) to <hi>Feroe</hi> who Baptized all the people there.</p>
               <p>Though the Inhabitants of <hi>Feroe</hi> did not, after the Death of <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> break the contract of their Baptiſme with Chriſt, as is perceived and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the Hiſtory of King <hi>Olaus</hi> the Holy, who not only acquired friends in <hi>Feroe,</hi> but alſo called them to him, and made them take their oath which he had not done, if they had not confeſſed themſelves to be Chriſtians, having continual work with thoſe of <hi>Iſland</hi> that came to him to be converted to the Chriſtian Faith, as the Chronicle of <hi>Norway</hi> plainly teacheth. Nevertheleſs one may well perceive that the beginnings of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion were very mean, the Inhabitants in a long time refuſing to acknowledge the Kings of <hi>Norway</hi> for their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns. Whence we find alſo, that it was long before they got any Biſhops
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:51993:183"/>
in the Country: for Biſhop <hi>Sarquir,</hi> that is the fifth in the Catalogue of Biſhops, which Mr. <hi>Peter Clauſon</hi> reckoneth, lived 200 years after <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmund Breſteſon;</hi> for he was Biſhop in the time of King <hi>Hagen Hagenſon,</hi> in the year 1223. as is ſaid before in the 4th. chapter. Wherefore, if the Preaching of the Goſpel had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued without interruption, there would needs have been more then four Biſhops in two ages, though there may be an errour in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, ſince we find that there has been a Biſhop in <hi>Feroe,</hi> in the time of King <hi>Magnus Erlingſon,</hi> in the year 1277. whoſe name was <hi>Roar,</hi> by whom King <hi>Suere</hi> was brought up, whoſe name, though the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned amongſt them is left out of the Biſhops Catalogue; it might therefore more probably be, that ſome of their names are left out, of whom we find nothing in Hiſtory; yet howſoever it be, all beginnings being difficult, ſpecially the light of the word being obſtructed by the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:51993:184"/>
Prince of darkneſs, it may very well have been ſo in matters of Religion, here in <hi>Feroe,</hi> till at laſt there came Biſhops into the Country, but we cannot find when that was; poſſible in King <hi>Sigurd</hi> the <hi>Hieroſolumites</hi> time, in the age 1100. when the Kings of <hi>Norway</hi> were well ſetled, wherewith the Catalogue of Biſhops doth beſt agree.</p>
               <p>When the ſaid Biſhops came firſt higher, they had their reſidence at <hi>Kircke boe</hi> in <hi>Stremoe,</hi> where there hath been formerly many ſtone build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that are now ruin'd, there only remaining a ſtone houſe with a great Parlour of Timber, built after the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient faſhion.</p>
               <p>The Church which they had then in that place, is yet ſtanding, and is made uſe of: it is built of free-ſtone, but of a very poor and low ſtructure. There ſtands beſides, another new Church-wall, which one of the laſt Biſhops called <hi>Hillarius</hi> did build, it is a curious Edifice of even ſtone, and the frames of the Windows are
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:51993:184"/>
of Stone, purpoſely cut for that uſe. The Wall is yet in ſome manner unhurt, and one might yet build a Church of it, if the hearers would not ſpare their pains.</p>
               <p>The Biſhops in thoſe days here as in other places, have had great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Country, but the Prieſts have fared very meanly; It is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known how many Biſhops have been in <hi>Feroe:</hi> Mr. <hi>Peter Clauſon</hi> in his Deſcription of <hi>Norway,</hi> reckoneth up the following, <hi>Sudmunds, Mathias, Kroll, Suein</hi> or <hi>Swerke, Peter, Gauti, Serquir, Erland</hi> or <hi>Ellendar, Loden, Sigvar, Giaffvard, Hanard;</hi> beſides theſe, there is found Biſhop <hi>Roar</hi> in the Hiſtory of King <hi>Suerre,</hi> who it ſeems ſhould be the third in order, and beſides the ſaid Biſhop <hi>Hillarius,</hi> that built the new Church wall. <hi>Arrild Huitfield</hi> in the Chronicle of King <hi>Frederick</hi> the I. in the year 1532. writes, that <hi>Amund Oluffſon</hi> was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Biſhop of <hi>Feroe,</hi> being a Canon of <hi>Bergen,</hi> and gave the King 1000 Gilders of <hi>Feroe,</hi> for his confirmation;

               <p>Thus there is in <hi>Feroe</hi> 39 Pariſh-Churches; the ſaid Churches are but little according to the meanneſs of the Congregations; they are built with deals, and without covered with ſtones: except the Church of <hi>Thors haven,</hi> which is pretty great, being built of whole beams, with a ſteeple thereby, whereunto King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the Fourth of happy Memory, gave Timber, and cauſed it to be built in the year 1609. And the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons lying ſo wide ſcattered from each other, the Prieſts have a great deal of pains, and undergo great dangers in Winter in viſiting them often; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſome lie a great way from their houſes, and the Churches that are far remote on the little Iſlands cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be attended, becauſe of ſtorm and bad weather. And when one comes there, the Service of God muſt be regulated according to the Tides;
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:51993:188"/>
which if neglected one muſt tarry there ſix hours longer, and in the mean time the wind may change; ſo that ſtorm and bad weather keepeth one there a whole fortnight. When the Prieſt will viſit great <hi>Dimen,</hi> they muſt draw him up, and let him down with a rope: neither can he come to them but in the Summer. They do not viſit their Congregations every Sunday, but every 5th, 6th, or 7th week, as the ſeaſon of the year will permit.</p>
               <p>The Prieſts Revenue is this, They have of every one of their hearers, that receiveth the Sacrament, one skin, that is four <hi>Daniſh</hi> ſhillings, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead for their offering, the three great Feaſts of the year; which may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meunt to the ſum of thirty Gilders; in ſome placestwenty Gilders, or leſs. 2ly they have for Tythes, the 4th part of Corn, wool, butter and fiſh. In the Southern Inlets where the Land is moſt fruitful, their Tythes may amount in Corn to eight or ten tuns. In the North Inlets to four or ſix Tuns. In the Northern Inlets, they have in
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:51993:189"/>
the greateſt Corporations 10 or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Loads of waſhed wool, in the leſſer Corporations, 4, 6, or 8 Loads, according as God maketh ſheep proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and thus ſome years more, and ſome years leſs. In the Northern In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, namely in <hi>Sandoe</hi> and <hi>Suderoe,</hi> where ſheeps wool is ſhort, and of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral colours, they get little or no Tythes thereof. They have a Tun, or ſomething more of butter, in the beſt Pariſhes, and 10 or 30 Loads of fiſh; ſome years very little, according as God bleſſeth their fiſhing, though it be there now very little eſteemed. The Prieſts have ever from the beginning had a houſe, which his Majeſty was pleaſed to givet hem; whereof if the rent were to be paid, it would amount according to the Book of Rents, to a matter of 20 Gilders.</p>
               <p>Fiſhing having now failed this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, ſo that the Prieſts could hardly ſubſiſt, and there being no means to aſſiſt Prieſts Widows, that did not marry the Succeſſour; his Majeſty King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the Fourth
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:51993:189"/>
(wherefore the Lord reward him c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally) upon their humble Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, gratiouſly granted every Prieſt of this Country yet another free houſe, namely in the year 1632, the 23<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April;</hi> the Revenue whereof may amount to 20 Gilders: by which Grant the condition of Prieſts is pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well bettered. According to the premiſſes the Revenue of a Prieſt put together, in the beſt Corporation may amount to a great 100 of Gilders; where with noue can maintain himſelf and his wife and Children; but, as in <hi>Denmark</hi> the Prieſts have pretty good Revenue of their own tillage, in their free houſes; likewiſe here home bred ſheep and kine do conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually feed the Family, but wool muſt contribute moſt to houskeep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the beſt and cleareſt money pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from thence. Wherefore a Prieſt in <hi>Feroe,</hi> when his duty doth not take him up, muſt not only be a good Husbandman, but alſo a good Tradesman, that is, a Hoſe-knitter; for he, and his wife, muſt diligently
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:51993:190"/>
look to it that his people do ſpin and knit ſtockings, that may be merchants ware; which if they do not, they fall to ruine. And that Houskeeping re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring many people, one muſt have at leaſt 5 or 6 Serving. men, and as many Maids for working the wool, and doing other ſervices of the houſe; which great Houskeeping doth very much eat up it ſelf. Beſides, a Prieſt here does not know how to provide for his Sons, but muſt needs keep them in other places to learn ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wherewith to get their living in time, which puts them to pretty great expences. Wherefore, that they may ſatisfie every body honeſtly and well, they farm alſo ſome of other mens grounds, as they find moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient; ſpecially that field, which lies in their free cloſe, that they may enjoy their own in liberty for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; a common encloſure produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing uſually Quarrels in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>That we are able thus to live, we have ſpecially to thank moſt humbly,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:51993:190"/>
after God, firſt thoſe deceaſed Godly Kings, that have granted us thoſe Priviledges; the Lord let their Souls be bound in the bundle of the living, and be their precious reward in the Reſurrection of the Juſt. Secondly our moſt Gracious Sovereign now reigning, King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the Fifth, who not only lets us enjoy the ſame free houſes, but alſo out of his innate mildneſs, hath proffered us other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Graces. The great King of Heaven give peace unto him, with a long peaceable and happy reign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lord give him victory over his enemies, and cover him under the ſhadow of his wings, let no evil come near his domicil, let his holy Angels ever pitch their tents about him whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever he goeth, ſatiate him, Lord, with a long life, and let him ever ſee thy ſalvation.</p>
               <p>And although the Pariſhioners (which yet ought not to be) govern themſelves according to the antient Ordinance of Chriſtianity, and do not after the Church-ordinance of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:51993:191"/>
after the three great Holy-days of the year, except in <hi>Thors-haven,</hi> (which I cannot here omit) but will record to the eternal praiſe of my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners, who for ſome years ago in the time of my Predeceſſor, without being required, have willingly begun to offer on the ſaid three principal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-days of the year; which they have not only continued in my time, but alſo augmented it, both thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtrangers that reſide here, as alſo the poor native Pariſhioners, God grant them and all pious Hearers, that they may offer unto God their hearts as a living, holy, and pleaſant ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; the Lord receive their prayers as a perfume, and the lifting up of their hands as an evening offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I ſay, although they offer not, we ſeek not our right or power therein, but rather, according to the Example of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> maintain our ſelves by our own tillage of what his Majeſty hath granted us; that we may not ſeem to ſeek more the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> means, than the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:51993:191"/>
But there being but little wool in the South Inlets, in the Corporations of <hi>Sandoe</hi> and <hi>Suderoe,</hi> and no Tythes thereof being paid, the Prieſts cannot maintain themſelves with their calling alone; though they as well as others, have a Tenement of augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except fiſhing be more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</p>
               <p>As the Chriſtian Magiſtrate hath provided for the office of Prieſthood here, ſo God hath furniſhed theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Iſlands with able Preachers, who teach the pure word of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true Confeſſion of <hi>Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh;</hi> and though they cannot, as in other places conſtantly viſite their Congregations, they perform never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the ſervice of God every Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day and day of Prayer, in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Pariſh. In the mean time they oblige their hearers to have their meetings in houſes on Holydays, and to read an Homily, and ſing Pſalms to the Praiſe of God: obliging alſo Parents to inſtruct their Children, ſince one cannot inform them every
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:51993:192"/>
Sunday, which if they are not able to doe they are admoniſhed to appoint one in every Pariſh, that readeth beſt, to teach them for a reaſonable ſallary, and beſides the Provoſts General ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining in his Viſitation, every one heareth his own, according as time and opportunity will permit.</p>
               <p>They do not only obſerve all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths, Holydays, and new Moons, Prayer days, as in other places; but alſo twice a year three certain gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days of Prayer, namely 3 days in the Week of the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, from the Sunday to the Aſcention, and 3 days in Michaelmas week. The 3 days in the week of the Aſcention were eſtabliſhed 469 years after the birth of Chriſt, by <hi>Manertus Claudius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Vienne</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that during his time in the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, there happened not only a great deal of terrible Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, with fearful Earth-quakes, but Wolves alſo did run about, and not only tore Cattle to pieces in the Field, but ran into Towns, and did the like
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:51993:192"/>
with men. Wherefore, to appeaſe Gods anger, he ordained theſe three Prayer days to be kept in all his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick; which Godly Ordinance the other Chriſtians elſewhere took up of themſelves, whereof read <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuanus lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Faſtorum.</hi> And they were afterwards confirmed and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be kept through all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the III. in the time of the Emperour <hi>Charlemain,</hi> in the year 816.</p>
               <p>The 3 Prayer days about Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, are alſo eſtabliſhed by the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> who have yet ordered more Litanies, but by which of them it was done, I could not perceive by their acts, Religion being reſormed in <hi>Feroe,</hi> the Teachers and Hearers have out of Godly intention, kept theſe 2 ſorts of days of Prayer, doubtleſs to the end, that in the Spring they might pray to God for his bleſſings upon the Land, with good Fiſhing, increaſe of Corn, and augmentation of Cattel; and in the Autumn thank God for his bleſſings and benefits; which cuſtome
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:51993:193"/>
being pious, it is continued to this day. The Lord accept of all to the Glory of his Name.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of Specters and Illuſions of Satan in <hi>Feroe.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THough the Hearers are here free from falſe Doctrine and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, yet Satan doth not omit to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them in other manners, that he might overcome them. There are many examples related by people that live yet, how he hath deluded their Parents in the darkneſs of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery; which we will altogether paſs by as a Fable (though much of it may be true) and here only inſert how the ſaid common enemy hath behaved himſelf towards many perſons, ſince the pure light of the Goſpel doth ſhine amongſt us, in deluding, ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:51993:200"/>
and leading them out of the right path of Gods word; for we have here many Examples how he hath taken ſome away, and carried away ſome, reſtoring them afterwards, though weakned in their underſtanding; whereof I will only mention ſome certain Hiſtories, that are yet in the memory of man, and ſome others that have happened whileſt I was my ſelf at <hi>Feroe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had not a mind to meddle with that matter, it being of a very ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane and hidden nature, that can ſcarce or not at all be comprehended by a mortal man, but there being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of a weak faith that will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there are ſuch Apparitions in nature: though many wiſe and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men maintain it in their writings, and ſpecially <hi>Ludovicus Lavaterus,</hi> a famous Divine, in a particular Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe <hi>de Spectris<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and is ſo generally known in <hi>Feroe,</hi> that almoſt every where in the Country, where they have read no Books thereof, nor heard any relation from other places, know
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:51993:200"/>
it ſo perfectly by the open works and apparitions of Satan, that they are in no doubt at all of it: yea, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet ſpirit hath lately plaid a trick in my Congregation, and in the whole Country, whereby he gave me e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to do, though he was forced with ſhame, by the vertue of God to creep away &amp; retire into his darkneſs; therefore in ſpight of him, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of his Kingdom, to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the believers, and convince unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, I have made bold to inſert here, and put forth the following true Hiſtories and matters of fact.</p>
            <p>It happened about fifty years ago, or above, that there lived a Tenant called <hi>Simon Simonſon</hi> in the antient Biſhop-houſe of <hi>Kirkeloe,</hi> whereunto belongeth a little Iſland under <hi>Sandoe,</hi> called <hi>Hode</hi> or <hi>Troldboffred,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Oxen feed Winter and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. There was found on the ſaid Iſland an Oxe, which did not belong to the Farmer, nor to any man of the Country, wherefore the Bayliff did chailenge the propriety of it in the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:51993:201"/>
Kings name, and commanded the Farmer to bring him the ſaid Oxe, which he prepared todo, having with all his folks a great deal of pains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could overcome it, and lay it bound in the Boat; but being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted in good weather from the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>and, he was with all his folks and the Oxe carried away, the Boat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back ſafe and whole, with all the Oars to land, ſo that there was no ſign at all the people could be periſhed in other manner. Beſides the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-man had taken with him in the Boat three of his own Oxen, that ſwam in the Sea near the Boat, and were taken up. This happened, as is known to all underſtanding old peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the year 1617.</p>
            <p>It arrived for a ſhort while ago, namely in the year 1665. that the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants Daughter of <hi>Froldeneſſe Gaard,</hi> in <hi>Kalſoe</hi> of <hi>Norderoe,</hi> a marriageable maid, went in the evening from her work, and was loſt, ſo that ſhe was never found ſince. Neither is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny likelihood ſhe ſhould be periſhed,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:51993:201"/>
the Sea being far from the houſe, and ſhe never having had any ſad thoughts, wherefore ſhe ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do her ſelf.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Daniſh</hi> Hiſtorian, <hi>Saxo Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matticus,</hi> is much blamed by Forein Writers, for having, amongſt other things, inſerted in his Hiſtory ſuch incongruous accidents with reaſon; ſpecially how King <hi>Hading</hi> was led away under the earth by a ſpirit in the figure of a woman, and yet came back again. It may alſo be that the ingenious Reader will blame me, as one that filleth this Treatiſe with Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Fables; but I know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that what I write did happen ſo, though we cannot comprehend it by reaſon. It was not ſo ſtrange, that ſuch happened in the darkneſs of Paganiſm, Satan being then powerful amongſt unbelievers, as it is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful it ſhould now come to paſs God having implanted his true faith in the heart of the Children of men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they might extinguiſh the eburn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dart of Satan. But theſe Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:51993:202"/>
being uſeful, partly by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance to draw men from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of fin, incite them to continual prayer and invocation; partly, that one may not ſo eaſily reject the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Writings of the Antient, though they do not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> agree with theſe times; I will therefore proceed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſome Examples of thoſe that have been carried away, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, as King <hi>Hading;</hi> joyning thereunto my poor meaning and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; deſiring never theleſs the courteous Reader to take, all in the beſt meaning, and not judge or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn before he underſtands it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly.</p>
            <p>It happened for a good while ſince, when the Burgers of <hi>Bergen</hi> had the commerce of <hi>Feroe,</hi> that there was a man in this Country in <hi>Servaag</hi> called <hi>Jonas Soideman,</hi> who was kept by ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in a mountain during the ſpace of ſeven years, and at laſt came out; but lived afterwards in great diſtreſs and fear, leſt they ſhould again take him away; wherefore people were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:51993:202"/>
to watch over him in the night, and at laſt, for fear of that, he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from hence to <hi>Bergen</hi> in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whileſt Mr. <hi>Taalle</hi> was Prieſt in <hi>Oſteroe,</hi> it happened that one of his Hearers was carried away, and though returned again; at laſt the ſaid young man being to be married, and every thing prepared, and the Prieſt being arrived the <hi>Saturday</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the Pariſh, the Bridegroom was carried away; wherefore they ſent folks to look after him, but he could not be found; the Prieſt deſired his friends to have good courage, and that he would come again; which he did at laſt, and related, that the ſpirit that led him away was in the ſhape of a moſt beautiful woman, and very richly cloathed, who deſired him to forſake her whom he was now to marry, and conſider how ugly his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs was in compariſon of her, and what fine apparel ſhe had; he ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that he ſaw the men that ſought after him, and that they went cloſe
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:51993:203"/>
by him, but could not ſee him; and that he heard their calling, and yet could not anſwer them: but that, when he would not be perſwaded, he was again left at liberty.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Eraſmus Ganting</hi> Pariſh-Prieſt in <hi>Waagoe,</hi> whoſe Son Mr. <hi>John Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſſan</hi> was my Predeceſſor in <hi>Thors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haven,</hi> his daughter called <hi>Chriſtine,</hi> being young, went once in Summer, in the abſence of her Father, to play in the fields with her other young Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Siſters; and as they were playing, there came to them a Duck running in the graſs, fluttering with her wings, and the Children running after the Duck, this Girl ran before them, and coming behind a houſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Duck, they ſaw her no more, and knew not what became of her. Whereupon her father being come home, and hearing this, was very much troubled, and ſeeking after the child, but could find her no where. At laſt he ſought the aſſiſtance of God by prayers, and invocation, and going once into the field; did ſeek as far as
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:51993:203"/>
he could; and it being eight days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her loſs, he found her, unhurt, and warm, ſleeping and wrapt with her head-cloth about her head, lying on a high rock above a hundred fathoms high, juſt at the brink of it. He took her ſo home along with him, but the child could relate nothing of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſaying that a great man carried her away, whom ſhe thought had been her Father. When ſhe came to years ſhe was of a weak underſtanding, and was nevertheleſs married in the Country, having many children: ſhe died a few years ſince, her Mother and three ſiſters being yet living.</p>
            <p>For thirty years ſince, it happened, that a woman of <hi>Weſtmans-haven</hi> in <hi>Stremoe,</hi> was carried away, and by common prayers in the congregation, was found again on the eighth day, but dead and yet warm, lying in the midd'ſt of a high way.</p>
            <p>In the year 1668, the ſecond of <hi>Auguſt, Domin.</hi> 2. <hi>Trinit.</hi> the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Olluff Hanſon,</hi> of <hi>Velberſtat,</hi> was miſt on the way, as ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:51993:204"/>
from Church, having the ſame day received the Sacrament of me, whereupon in the evening, as well as two days after, they ſought for her every where but could not find her; at laſt her father complained unto me, and the next <hi>Sunday,</hi> being the 9th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the Congregation of <hi>Kal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bach,</hi> which I then viſited, I earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admoniſh'd them to fall down with me before God, for the deliverance of that poor creature. The Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo heard our prayers and interceſſion, for the next day at three a clock in the afternoon, ſhe was found by ſome Milk-maids in the next Hamlet to <hi>Volberſtat,</hi> namely <hi>

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:51993:204"/>
ſhewed him beyond them a pretty high clift, whence ſhe had glided; down though the man aſſures, it was impoſſible for any man to come down from thence without hurt; beſides, her linnen and clothes were as clean, and her ſhoes as new, as the day ſhe was miſs'd, though there had been during ſome days and nights great ſtorms and rainy weather: neither did ſhe according to her own confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, eat any thing during theſe nine days, and yet being come home, was well diſpoſed to receive and digeſt whatſoever meat they gave her.

            <p>In the year 1669.

of God the boy overcame him; ſo that the evil ſpirit fled when ever he ſaw him, and the boy could alſo plainly ſee when he came: but as ſoon as he begun to pray or ſing, the Spirit vaniſhed? He afterwards trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his Siſter from the beginning of <hi>Auguſt</hi> to <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> the Maids name is <hi>Mary,</hi> when the ſpirit came to her ſhe grew very ſick, and hath almoſt continually been ſick and weak of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſince he begun to trouble her. But that I might have certain information thereof, I have ſent for the Boy, from whoſe mouth I received the following relation. He told me, that he ſaw him firſt about St. <hi>Olaus</hi> day in the evening, before the houſe in the Figure of a great man in grey cloaths. The next time he ſaw him was on Chriſtmas Eve, when he came into the houſe and took out his Siſter; wherefore the Boy purſued him and found him neer the River, ſtanding over the Maid, which lay on the Earth near the water; but at the Boys coming he went away;
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:51993:207"/>
wherefore the Boy carried his Siſter into the houſe, ſhe being ſick and weak: but the Spirit followed him ſoftly to the houſe, and when the boy came out again, he ſtood yet before it. The next day in the evening he came again in the room, and the boy ſaw him leaning againſt a Poſt; but they being awake in Prayer and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, he did not tarry long: and when he went out the boy followed him out of doors, wherefore he ſpoke to the boy, and ask'd wherefote he followed him ſo? the boy ask'd him again, what he had to do there? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he anſwered that he ſhould get what he came for. And the boy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that he ſhould not get it at all. Whereupon he went away, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man; but came nevertheleſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſeveral times in the night, when they were watching over the Girle, being in the mean time in continual Prayers and Singing of Pſalms, but he did them no harm, except that he put out the light, and the boy grew ſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thing ſick, the Girle not being able
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:51993:207"/>
to ſpeak as long as he was there: the 23<hi>th</hi> day, being <hi>Chriſtmas Eve,</hi> the Boy being abſent, the ſpirit came in, as ſhe ſate by the Table, and was playing at Cards with her other bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and ſiſters, and ſtruck her on the one ſide as ſhe ſate, ſo that ſhe ſpit blood afterward. Since came the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Prieſt to them, and ſent her over to <hi>Gote</hi> in <hi>Ostereo;</hi> from which time they have perceived nothing of the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>In the aforeſaid Examples there are many things conſiderable which ought not to be paſſed by in ſilence.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, that they let them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be ſeen in outward and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real ſhape, is not only proved by Profane and Church Writers, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Sulpitius Severus, in vita Martini Epiſcopi Turonenſis,</hi> but alſo by the Holy Scripture, in the Divels tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jeſus Chriſt in the wilderneſs. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4th.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that they have their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation within Mountains in Caverns and Holes, vacant and dry places; our
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:51993:208"/>
famous Divine Doctor <hi>Jaſper Brocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> teaching us alſo in his Syſteme of Divinity, that they inhabit in thoſe places that are polluted with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny crying ſin, as effuſion of blood, or where unbelief or ſuperſtition hath gotten the upper-hand.</p>
            <p>But it ſeems they go into the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, where the eye of man can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no entrance; the poſſibility whereof <hi>Stephanus Johannis Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> in his Notes upon <hi>Saxo Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticus,</hi> teacheth us to be by the cunning power of Satan: but in what manner it happeneth, is an Art the Devil keeps for himſelf.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that they will abuſe the body of men to luxury was well known to the Heathens, who called them therefore <hi>Inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bus</hi> and <hi>Succubus;</hi> as alſo to the holy Fathers, wherefore <hi>Hieronymus</hi> by reaſon of their great luxury, called them <hi>ſicarius's;</hi> yea, many witches confeſſions of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Satan, do plainly witneſs it; whereof many examples are found <hi>in Theatr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> de veneficis,</hi> and other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="367" facs="tcp:51993:208"/>
Fourthly, that they cannot eaſily carry men away, as they pleaſe, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth by the Almightineſs of God, whoſe power is greater than the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, and aſſiſteth thoſe poor men, for elſe it would be as eaſie for them to carry away men in their infirmities, as it was for the tempter to carry Chriſt through the Air, upon the Pinacle of the Temple.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That they cannot do men more harm than God permitteth them; which is plainly perceived in the Book of <hi>Job:</hi> That they may be ſeen by ſome men and not by all, might be proved by more Examples here in <hi>Feroe,</hi> that being a meer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment of their nature, and that people grow much altered, when they ſee ſuch Apparitions.</p>
            <p>The curious Reader may, perhaps, be deſirous to know, what they may be? There have been many before now, and are yet, that will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſuch Apparations, eſteeming them to be only the meer fancies of melancholly people; but it is as great
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:51993:209"/>
errour to deny them, for the many examples, both here and elſewhere, not only amongſt common people, that do eaſily deceive others or are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but alſo amongſt many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding men, as is read in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, together with the Holy Scripture ſufficiently prove their exiſtencie; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that the eyes and ears of men, in many ſights and Apparitions, by an errour of the ſence are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>And as the Diſciples took Jeſus Chriſt when he walked upon the Sea, and when he appeared to them the doors being ſhut, to be a Phantaſm or a Spirit; ſo many ſimple people pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending they have ſeen or heard ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which were not ſo, maketh that the moſt part contemn the opinion, there ſhould be any.</p>
            <p>We call ſuch Apparitions Specters, becauſe they preſent themſelves to the eyes of men, appearing as if they were real bodies, whereas they are ſpirits, that take upon them an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal figure, and in reſpect to a right
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:51993:209"/>
created body, are to be conſidered but as ſhadows. Wherefore Chriſt ſays to his Apoſtles, that took him to be ſuch a ſpirit, Why are you ſo afraid? and why come ſuch thoughts into your hearts? look upon my hands and feet, it is my ſelf; feel and ſee; for a ſpirit hath neither fleſh nor bones, as you ſee I have; that is, though a ſpirit appears with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward figure of a body. By which words Chriſt doth not refute the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles opinion of ſpirits, as vain and erroneous, but agrees with them, that there are Phantaſms, that they are ſpirits, and that the figure they take, hath not the propriety of a natural body. Secondly, Chriſt grants, that they had cauſe to have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, if he had been a Phantaſm. Whereby we are taught, that our own nature proveth their exiſtencie, ſince we are afraid when they appear, by reaſon of the innate emnity which is between men and ſuch ſpirits. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>Eliphas</hi> of <hi>Theman</hi> ſaw a ſpirit going before him, and there
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:51993:210"/>
ſtood an image before his eyes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he did not know the figure, but heard a voice, the hair of his body ſtood upon end. In Latin they call them <hi>Spectra,</hi> that is, ſuch ſpirits as are ſeen, ſo that the inviſible good Angels when they appear in viſible forms, for as much as they are ſeen, may alſo be called <hi>Spectra;</hi> but we according to the Holy Scriptures, and the explication of all Learned men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding only by <hi>Specters,</hi> ſpirits who in ſeveral viſible Figures and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes appear unto men, either to hurt or frighten them; of which ſort was the figure that appeared to King <hi>Saul</hi> in the likeneſs of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 Sam. 28. as alſo the Divels outward ſhape, that ſpoke with Chriſt, and tempted him in the wilderneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>The Heathens, in their writings, call ſome of thoſe <hi>Specters, Eaunes, Satyrs</hi> and <hi>Panes,</hi> which we call in <hi>Daniſh, Skow</hi> and <hi>Bierge-Trold,</hi> that is Wood and Mountain ſpirits; thoſe of <hi>Feroe</hi> call them under-ground peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, hollow men, and <hi>Foddenskemand.</hi>
               <pb n="371" facs="tcp:51993:210"/>
The Holy Scripture calls them Gods of the Woods, <hi>Eſaiah</hi> 13<hi>th.</hi> and alſo field Gods, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. which really are none but unclean ſpirits. I have read in the writings of a godly man, who pretended that, beſides the good and bad Angels, there were alſo external ſpirits of the world, which were not eternal, and took their natural ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of the worlds viſible ſpirit, and finiſhed alſo naturally; which if it were, they ſhould then be ſome other Creatures then the eternal ſpirits, or the viſible ſhap'd Creatures. Though there be much whereof our eyes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the eſſence, our reaſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending no further, then what is diſcovered in the outward corporal nature, which yet it harldly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends; as the wiſe man complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; nevertheleſs one ought not to affirm ſuch things, as have no ground in the word of God, though it were ſo in nature; and therefore we will only contemplate theſe Apparitions by the clear light of Gods word, and thereby, together with underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:51993:211"/>
Learned mens writings, ſee what one may conclude and judge of them.</p>
            <p>One would think it might be worth a particular Speculation, that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture ſpeaks of Phantaſms to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Zijm, Jim,</hi> and <hi>Ochim, Eſa.</hi> 13. 21. <hi>cap.</hi> 34. 14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 39. for the Lord threatning <hi>Babylon</hi> with its laſt deſtruction, ſaith by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eſaias, Babylon</hi> ſhall be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> and no man ſhall inhabit there any more, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther live there for ever; but <hi>Zijm</hi> ſhall there pitch their Tents, and their houſes ſhall be full of <hi>Ochim,</hi> Oſtridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ſhall live there, and wood divels leap thereabouts; Owls ſhall ſing in their Palaces, and Dragons dwell in their pleaſure-houſes.</p>
            <p>The Prophets calling them <hi>Zihim</hi> and <hi>Ohim</hi> is not expounded by <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> in his Bible by any other word, but he writes in the Margin, that he taketh them to be all ſorts of wild Beaſts; underſtanding, without doubt, ſuch wilde Beaſts as the wiſe man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes

The wiſe man reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth alſo up theſe unknown Beaſts, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. 9. among ſpirits, wherewith the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. <hi>Maldonatus</hi> in his <hi>Scholia</hi> upon <hi>Eſaiah,</hi> eſteems this kind of cruel, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, wild Beaſts to be a ſort of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels.</p>

            <p>My poor concluſion is this, that the examples and clear words of the Holy Scripture do agree both with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hiſtories, as alſo with the above-mentioned of the apparition of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that they were not fancies, but were real and indeed; and thoſe Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges not being ſubſtantial bodies, they muſt be ſpirits in external figure; and appearing to hurt men, that they are

not good, but bad ſpirits, that is very Divels. And ſuch as are mentioned in the aboveſaid true Hiſtories<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they appeared in the Figure of man, or of any Beaſt, are doubtleſs that ſort of Divels which the Holy Scripture particularly calls Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods in the fifth Book of <hi>Moſes, Chap.</hi> 32. <hi>ver.</hi> 17. 2 <hi>Chron.

            <p>As long as theſe Iſlands of <hi>Feroe</hi> have been uninhabited during ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred years, it ſeems they have been nothing but an habitation of Devils, a Domicill for unclean ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and a Den of Goblings, it being ſufficiently known in Hiſtory what power the Devil had antiently in the Countreys of the <hi>North Iſland, Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Varmeland,</hi> and <hi>Lapland;</hi> and many know how powerful they are there to this very day.

and ſtrangers to the knowledge of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, theſe ſpirits had power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough amongſt them by reaſon of their unbelief, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. yet in this time he hath been for the moſt part quiet; but when the Lord had ſent them his word, the Miniſters thereof, alas! mix'd that pure word with humane Superſtition and figments and fill'd their Hearers hearts more with errors and ſuperſtitions than with true and juſtifying faith. But as darkneſs is never ſo thick, but the light doth break through, ſo the light of God's Word did ſhine in thoſe dark days for them, that did ſeek inviſible things, and they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a true faith ſhining in their good works; but others that gaped after outward ſplendor, which was though but darkneſs, and remained in obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, being blinded in their errors and ſuperſtition; whereby Satan made at that time more proofs of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſhip than at any other, aſwel here, as in other places, by many falſe ſights and miracles, that he might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter extinguiſh their ſpark of faith, and
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:51993:215"/>
wholly darken their underſtanding. Finally, God having out of his Grace, driven away ſuch darkneſs of errors, by the great new kindled light of his Goſpel; the great Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was forced to retire and hide himſelf; but, it ſeems, he hath not been in quiet, and therefore by the permiſſion of God, breaks out and ſometimes openly deludes theſe poor Inhabitants, ſeducing them ſometimes to their eternal ruine, and ſometimes to an errour and deluſion for a time.</p>
            <p>Chriſt teacheth us how this cometh to paſs in the Goſpel according to St. <hi>Matthew, Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 43. That the unclean ſpirit finding no reſt in his dry manſion, returneth then back with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven other ſpirits worſe than himſelf; that is to ſay, with many groſs ſins and vices to precipitate a man into. Truly, the deeds and effects ſhew the words of Chriſt to be true: for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expreſt how ſtedfaſtly ſome keep their old Traditions and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious cuſtoms, which they do ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly and diligently obſerve, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:51993:215"/>
themſelves very ſubtile if one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with ſharp admonitions and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from the word of God root them out.</p>
            <p>Beſides, many groſs ſins and vices, as in other places, here in uſe amongſt many, (the true Children of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in no ways meant hereby) here grow up young people that are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to their Parents, ſtiffnecked and contradictory; wherefore the Devil, as is ſaid before eaſily appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>Tell me, Chriſtian Reader, what is this? but that the old Spirit of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition is come again into his houſe, hath found lodging with thoſe many errours and ſuperſtitions, and with other unclean ſpirits, work out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abominations (God grant this were but in <hi>Feroe)</hi> ſo that it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if he thus far deludeth man; but it is to be wondred, that the Devil doth not oftner appear, taking and carrying more men away than he hath done already. We muſt thank God therefore that hath put a ring in his
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:51993:216"/>
noſe, that his goodneſs and long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering might incite men to better themſelves and repent; yea, it is the cunning of Satan not to appear ſo often in a viſible figure to many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious people, that continually call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and curſe by him, that at laſt he may lead them captives at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure into perdition.</p>
            <p>There may poſſibly yet be found ſome that will not believe all this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they never ſaw any ſuch Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions or Divels: whereunto I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that I never ſaw them neither, and pray God I may never ſee them; and which I alſo wiſh all my Readers: and if ever I ſhould ſee them, God being pleaſed to tempt me thereby, I will beſeech him to give me his Grace and a good Spirit, that I may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them by faith; this Opinion being otherwiſe an humane weakneſs, not unlike the infirmity of <hi>Thomas,</hi> that would not believe-except he ſaw; whereas faith doth conſiſt in believing things which are not ſeen, nor can be ſeen. It is a poor concluſion in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:51993:216"/>
that becauſe one hath not ſeen a thing, therefore it is not extant in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: every one hath a reaſonable Soul in himſelf, which is an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal living Spirit, and yet none could yet ſee it forſaking its habitation, and the parting from the body. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels pitch their Tents about the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet who ever ſaw them? none can ever ſee God and live afterwards in this mortal body; is there therefore no Soul, Angel nor God exiſting. As long as we are in this mortal body, we can naturally ſee none but corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real creatures, and yet our eyes are ſo weak, that they cannot diſcern ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, but by the help of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument invented for that purpoſe. Nevertheleſs there are men that have ſeen ſuch ſpirits, as is ſhewed by the aforementioned Examples, and other Hiſtories; but then thoſe ſpirits had taken upon them ſome viſible ſhape. The Specters above-ſaid are as well ſpirits, as the Angels, all being inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our eyes; nevertheleſs we read in the Holy Scripture, that many have
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:51993:217"/>
ſeen them, ſpecially the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, in ſuch an external figure as the buſineſs about which they were ſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did require; for the Aſs of <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaw the Angel of the Lord with a drawn ſword in his hand, which <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> could not ſee till the Lord open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his eye. <hi>Saul</hi> ſaw a figure in the likeneſs of <hi>Samuel; Eliſha</hi> ſaw a whole Army about him upon the mountain in the likeneſs of flaming waggons and Horſes, which his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Gehazi</hi> could neither ſee until his eyes were opened; King <hi>Belfhazar</hi> ſaw a hand before him writing apon the wall; to paſs by the examples of the <hi>Maccabees.</hi> That tempter the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel went openly to Chriſt in an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhape, and may be in that of a man, ſince he ſpoke as one. By which Examples this matter is clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by having been ſeen; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that will not believe the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Examples happened in <hi>Feroe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath not ſeen ſuch Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (though the ſaid Examples be as certain as if they had been ſworn

For it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in this Country, in the year 1667, that a perſon called <hi>Jacob Oluff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> being then at <hi>Giow</hi> in <hi>Oſteroe,</hi> in the 24 year of his age, the 17 of <hi>Jan.</hi> fell into a ſickneſs, lying a bed during a fortnight, and on the 14 day of his diſeaſe; namely, the 20 of <hi>Jan.</hi> on Sunday night, as he lay aſleep, there came one in to him with ſhining cloaths on, whereat he wakened, and perceived him in that figure in the bed by him, the room appearing full of ſplendour, and he gave the young man a ſerious ſalutation and reſpect.
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:51993:218"/>
Secondly, he asked him where his pain was? whereunto the young man anſwered nothing; afterwards he ſtroaked him with his hand along his breaſt, and round about; whereby the ſaid young man was preſently healed, and he enjoyn'd him then that he ſhould ſay a prayer thrice every day, pronouncing the prayer 3 times unto him; whereby the young man learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it inſtantly, it being as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <q>O Thou worthy, Holy Ghoſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter of all ſorrowful and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted! thou knoweſt beſt what cur fleſh and blood can ſuffer in the croſs, where it goeth but ſadly with us, except we receive help from another place, then from our ſelves; be thou therefore my comforter and my Shield, ſtrengthen me by thy power, help me in my great infirmity and aſſiſt me; chear up my heart and mind, that I may call and cry unto thee for help in my neceſſity: ſtrengthen my faith, that I, with a firm expectation and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, may expect help and counſel from

            <p>Afterwards he told the young man, that he ſhould ſay this Prayer the firſt time he ſhould come to Church; firſt on the threſhold of the Church door, kneeling down with his face turned from the Church, commanding alſo that the people of the Country ſhould pray unto God, ſaying this Prayer, with joyned hands and bowed knees to the Lord thrice every day, ſo the Lord would turn away the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which threatned the Land; and commanded, that he ſhould admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="388" facs="tcp:51993:219"/>
Having ſaid that to the Lad, as he would go away, he added, Riſe ſound, and ſin no more! Departing ſo from him, and going away through the Roof-hole. Five days afterwards he appeared the ſecond time to the young man, before it was clear day, as the Lad was ſitting in his bed, and ſung the Pſalm, <hi>My Shepherd is the living Lord,</hi> &amp;c. it came in his mind as if one had deſired him to go out, though he ſaw nothing; whereupon he aroſe, and put on his clothes, and went out before the houſe, where he ſaw in the South South-weſt, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens open, and one coming down from thence, who ſtood by him in the yard with a Prieſts habit on, that reached down to his feet, the habit being red and white, with a red Croſs on the back; and he ſaid to him that he ſhould not at all doubt but he came from God; and therewith left him haſtily, aſcending to the place from whence he came. The next <hi>Sunday</hi> night, which was the ſeven and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of <hi>January,</hi> he came to him the
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:51993:219"/>
third time, as he lay awake, in the ſame form as the firſt time, through the Roof hole into the bed; and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him if he had ſpread abroad what he had commanded him? whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the youngman anſwered, yes. Whereunto the other replied, not ſo earneſtly as it ought to have been done: asking him withal, whether he had not ſeen ſome ſignes in the Heavens? the Lad anſwered, that he had ſeen no ſignes, but that other folks ſaid, they had ſeen two Suns in the Heavens <hi>(Samuel Powelſon, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clendar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Anderſon, Sineve, Jonas</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſome more of <hi>Eldevyg</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed in the Court, they had ſeen theſe Suns) then he ſaid, that they did look as if they had been Suns, though they were not; but a ſigne that they ſhould begin to keep Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, from the time they ſaw the true Sun ariſe, which was on <hi>Saturday</hi> at half an hour paſt 12 in the afternoon; and that Sermon which they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ou <hi>Sunday,</hi> ſhould be preached on <hi>Saturday</hi> in the afternoon; and that
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:51993:220"/>
when they rowed out, they ſhould ſing the Pſalm, <hi>My Shepherd is the living Lord,</hi> &amp;c. and as the Lad going about to wake his Stepfather, that lay in the bed with him, he departed as before, going out through the Roof-hole. The next night, <hi>Jan.</hi> 28<hi>th.</hi> he appeared unto him the fourth time, as he was awake as before; the young man ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him then who he was? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he was Saint <hi>John,</hi> that lay in the boſom of <hi>Jeſus</hi> at the Lords Supper, and ſpake no more, but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed away, as formerly. He came to him the fifth time in the night, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after the Pariſh-Prieſt Mr. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Helliſon Wiberg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> was gone to viſit his Congregation, and asked the Lad if he had declared to the Prieſt what he had commanded him? the young man anſwered yes, adding thereunto, that the Prieſt found very ſtrange, that he ſhould appear unto him, who was ſo great a ſinner. Whereunto the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Saint <hi>John</hi> anſwered, that the Lord had given many ſignes, and giveth yet many ſignes, that are not manifeſt.
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:51993:220"/>
Theſe apparitions became publike in the Country, and many of the ſimple hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers did put great faith therein. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I did ſend for the ſaid perſon, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined him, and earneſtly admoniſhed him, that he ſhould not have any thing to do with any ſuch invented figments; but the young man perſiſted in the ſame affirmation, that the ſaid matter was paſt in the foreſaid manner; wherefore I have written the matter of fact word by word as he told me.</p>
            <p>But the fire being once kindled, would not go out of its ſelf, but kindled it ſelf further round about; for his fame was ſpread over all the Iſlands, and in all Congregations: the common people gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving great credit thereunto; ſpecially ſervants for holydays ſake, and begun in many places to keep Saturday holy, believing really that it was juſt, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to whom this viſion did appear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſteemed by all to be very Godly, ſo that one had never heard a vain word or oath from his mouth. Wherefore many obſerved dilligently their new holyday, but they could not deſiſt from curſing &amp; ſwearing: beſids this, they invented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:51993:221"/>
many other viſions and ſpread them over the Country, the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much enclined thereunto; yea, theſe ſuperſtitious people out of their own fooliſh imagination, framed themſelves many arguments, giving out, that as God had illuminated ſome poor fiſhers, he could alſo illuminate this ſimple man; that God would make Apoſtles of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and ſpirits to preach unto men; That the Devil cannot take the ſhape of an Angel, can do no good, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak a true or good word; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding thereby, that the ſanctification of the Saturday was commanded by God and pleaſant unto him, as a pious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in it ſelf, and therefore ought to be obſerved, for the world coming near to its end, which the Lord will ſhorten, ſo ought the laſt day of the weeks work to be ſhortened, and the day ſanctified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. Whereupon ſome did riſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their teachers, as it happened unto me by one of my Congregation, who ſtood faſt thereupon, that to pray and keep holy was a good act and no ſin, and therefore none could blame or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it. Thus the common people is eaſily
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:51993:221"/>
deceived, and deceiveth others. Satan having thus ſuddenly ſeduced many ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple perſons from the true Prophetical word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their plainneſs in Chriſt, I ſent to every Prieſt in the Country a copy of the parties confeſſion about his Viſions, and therewith added my cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thereof; that they might read it in the Pulpit, and the hearers know how much thereof babling people had inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and added to theſe viſions and illuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Devil; and they at the ſame time teach and mildly admoniſh their hearers that they ſhould perſiſt in the conſtant word of God, and not ſeek a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way of worſhipping him, then is contained therein, or is injoyned by the Supream Magiſtrate to his honor, how ſeeming holy ſoever it might be. Having alſo in the explication of the Catechiſme in my viſitation, according to the ſpirit and grace which God hath given me, done my beſt to bring them out of that ſuperſtition and cunning error.</p>
            <p>At laſt it happened, that the ſaid, as was thought, Godly perſon, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing year, by the induction of that unclean ſpirit, fell into the ſin of Fornication;

one may the better know Satan, though he change himſelf in the holyeſt, and moſt beautiful Angel of Light.</p>
            <p>It is no ſtrange thing that ſuch deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful apparitions ſhould happen, to bring a man into ſuperſtition; ſpecially in this Country, ſince the Prophecy of Chriſt muſt alſo be fulfill'd here amongſt us, ſaying, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in the later times there ſhall ariſe many falſe Chriſts, and ſay here is Chriſt and there, &amp;c. ſo that even the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Divel cannot ſo diſguiſe himſelf as to hide his Claws, which is here perfectly ſeen by his giving himſelf out for Saint <hi>John,</hi> that lay on the boſom of Chriſt, at the Lords Supper; and beſides would teach men a particular Holiday, and thereby draw them from the pure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed word, from which no body might ſwerve-either to the right hand or to the left; from which one muſt neither take, nor add thereunto; except we will draw upon us all the curſes mentioned in the Holy Scripture, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 18. wherefore we will conclude with Saint <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. That if an Angel of Heaven would preach another Goſpel, than Chriſt and his Apoſtles have prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, let him be an Anathem. Upon the Premiſes I cannot judge, but that this apparition hath been a Phantaſm, or illuſion, and all the admonition, that ſimple young man had had a Phantaſie. There is enough written of Phantaſms in ſeveral Treatiſes, and they are of many ſorts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Phantaſms or Illuſions, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the Air, and are called by Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:51993:223"/>
               <hi>Phoenomena's,</hi> being ſeveral Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are ſeen in the Air; namely, ſtrange Suns, Armies, Ships, and ſuch other things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Phantaſms, that ſeems to be, and are not; as when the Apoſtles believed Chriſt to be an apparition or ſpirit, when he, in a ſtrange manner, did walk upon the Sea, and after his Reſurrection came in to them, the doors being ſhut.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Phantaſms, that by natural cauſes, namely the temperature and ſickneſs of a man, or what they think much upon, do appear in dreams. In this manner the Emperor <hi>Nero</hi> did no ſooner fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, but he had ſtrange dreams, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving killed his own Mother; his Tutor, and many other Citizens innocently. Thus cholerick and melancholy folks are troubled with Viſions, according to the predominant humour; whereof Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians and Naturaliſts write at large. St. <hi>Auſtin de Civit Dei, l.</hi> 18. writes, that one had related him, that before he went to bed, in his houſe, he ſaw a certain Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher come to him, expounding him the Books of <hi>Plato,</hi> which he had deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

            <p n="4">4. Phantaſms in themſelves, as they are and appear to men, when they are awake, that have properly no bodies, but aſſume one for a time, to delude man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ſuch commonly announce men pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and univerſal calamities, or bring them a deſpairing horror for their ſins. It was ſuch a one that appeared to <hi>Saul</hi> in the likeneſs of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced him his death. <hi>Plutarch</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, that there appeared a ſpirit to <hi>Marcus Brutus,</hi> as he was awake; and <hi>Brutus</hi> asking him who he was? he told him he was an evil ſpirit, and that he ſhould ſoon ſee him in the <hi>Philippian</hi> Fields. It is written of a Duke of the <hi>Athenians</hi> called <hi>Polyzelus,</hi> that he, in the fields of <hi>Marathon,</hi> ſaw a ſpirit bigger than a man, whereupon he grew blind,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:51993:224"/>
and yet having loſt his ſight won a great Battle upon the Enemy; ſuch ſpirits do vex men, and either hereby ſtrengthen them in their old errors, or will bring them into new ones, as the adoration of ſtrange gods, and ſuperſtitious works, which happened but too much in the times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Popery. All Learned Divines tell us, what we muſt believe of ſuch apparitions, namely, that they are evil ſpirits.</p>
            <p>In the relation of this ſimple man, there is made mention of two ſorts of apparitions; the one ſeen in the air, namely an u uſual Sun, that was nothing but an illuſion of Satan, whereby he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to introduce a ſtrange adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t on of God, and ſuperſtitious acts, which God does not require from us, that ſo he might by theſe Viſions, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them from the true word of God, to believe deceitful errors. Satan that brought down fire from Heaven upon the Cattle of <hi>Job, Job</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. could eaſily cauſe to ſhine a bright fire in the sky, evil ſpirits, reigning in the air, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>The other was properly a Phantaſm,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:51993:225"/>
or ſpirit: I am in doubt whether one may refer apparitions in dreams to Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, it being firſt come to him in his ſleep, when he was ſick, which might indeed cauſe ſuch a fancie; but ſince it hath oftner appeared to him afterwards, when he was in perfect health and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, and I often diligently asked the party, whether this was really ſeen by him; which he ever conſtantly affirm'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we muſt conclude, that it was a ſpirit and apparition; and though it had not ſuch terrible aſpect as the former Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, yet we know that Satan can trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf into an Angel of light, that evil ſpirit knowing very well that he could have promoted his Kingdom but little if he had appeared in his terrible figure, and put the black-ſide outward; wherefore he cloathed himſelf in a white ſhining Garment, and a Prieſts Habit, which is not his firſt Maſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>piece; for <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> in the life of <hi>Martin</hi> the Biſhop writeth, that Satan appeared once unto him when he was in bed and prayed, having a golden Crown on his head, and a white ſhining Garment on, with gilt ſhooes,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:51993:225"/>
who ſpoke to him, ſaying, I am Jeſus, who being come down on the earth, would firſt appear unto thee. <hi>Martin</hi> having look'd upon him, and bethought himſelf, ſaid, Jeſus did not go in this manner on earth, depart from me Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. Whereupon he preſently vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with a great ſtink. <hi>Plinius Secundus Novocamenſis, Hiſt.</hi> 7. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> relates, that there lay a Boy and ſlept amongſt other Children in the Chamber, when two ſpirits in white Clothes were ſeen to come therein, that cut the Boys hair as he lay aſleep, going ſo away; and in the morning the Boy was found with his hair cut, and ſpread about in the bed. There are Examples enough of Ghoſts that have appeared in Prieſts clothes, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of Popery, which we will omit, becauſe of their prolixity. Thus the white cloathes and holy Garments of this evil ſpirit cannot avail him, for he diſcovers himſelf, not only by his erro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neous Service of God, but alſo by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be the Perſon of St. <hi>John</hi> that lay in Chriſts boſome at the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. For having not been conſtant in truth, neither can he always ſpeak
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:51993:226"/>
truth. And we know that God ſends his Angels, for their ſake that are to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit Salvation, and not the Souls of the dead; for they are in the hand of God, where they reſt from all their labours. And if any of them appeared unto us, they ſhould either do it of their own Authority, which they cannot in the condition they are now, or by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, which happeneth not; for men have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, unto whom they ſhould hearken during this life, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 26. and it were in vain for them to appear, ſince none muſt believe them, under great puniſhment of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>ver.</hi> 11. yea, the Soul of dead Saints have left all thoughts and care of earthly things; for <hi>Abraham</hi> knoweth nothing of us, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> remembreth us not, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 64. <hi>v.</hi> 16. Finally, we read no where, either in the Old or New Teſtament, that God hath any time converſt with the living by means of the dead; God ſpoke indeed many times, and in ſeveral manners, to the antient by his Prophets, but now he hath ſpoken to us by his Son, and his Son withdrawing from us his
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:51993:226"/>
viſible preſence, ſent to us his Apoſtles and Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>ver.</hi> 19. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> we are Meſſengers in the place of Chriſt, for God admoniſheth by us; ſo we pray now in the name of Chriſt, we reconcile our ſelves unto God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 20. We may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by the premiſes, that the ſpirit of lies was not the perſon whom he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be, being much leſs ſent of God, as he gave out, but was the unclean ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit himſelf. This ſalutation alſo gives no little ſuſpition of him, when he uſed an earneſt ſalutation and worſhip! which agreeth little with that of holy Angels, but is rather like that of <hi>Apollo,</hi> the Idol of <hi>Delphos,</hi> which always contained ſome hidden Myſtery. Neither ought it to be an occaſion of error to any, that he healed him: It may be the young man was cured of himſelf on the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day, but if it be ſo, as the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſolemly proteſteth; it is eaſie for the Divel to heal and do good for a bad end, that he might thereby confirm men in their errors. God hath ratified his word by Miracles, that he might thereby ſtrengthen men in the true vivifying
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:51993:227"/>
faith; and beſides, we have a conſtant prophetical word, which alone we ought to believe, 2 <hi>Pet. ver.</hi> 19. But Satan is the ape of God, doing often the like things, that he may ſeduce men from faith and the word, to ſuperſtition, and thus be powerful in them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2 <hi>ver.</hi> 2. The Apoſtles ſhewing great ſignes and miracles, by healing the ſick, and making the blind to ſee, that they might bring blind Heathens from darkneſs to light, and from Belial to Chriſt; <hi>Simon</hi> the Magician is preſently ready to doe the ſame by the help of Satan, as powerfully and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly to the eyes of all <hi>Samaria,</hi> ſo that many ſtuck to him and ſaid, this is the great power and vertue of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 9, 10. It is needleſs to add more exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but we muſt conſider that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil does not do this for a paſtime, for Chriſt ſays of him, that he was a Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and a lyer from the beginning, <hi>John</hi> 8. 44. and it is his own nature to ſpeak lyes, and as the Father of lies, diſperſe them amongſt the Children of men. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſays plainly to the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 7. what he ſeeks by

                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> which is thereby to induce man to believe lies, wherefore he calls thoſe ſigns, lying wonders; not but that they doe ſometimes happen amongſt men, as this example witneſſeth, but becauſe he ſeeks thereby to ſtrenthen his lyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth of God; his falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip againſt Gods true adoration; his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition againſt the true juſtifying ſaith for God is truth, and his word is truth, his will being that all men come to the confeſſion of truth, and be ſaved, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. But Satan is the Father of lies, all his words being nothing but lies, and therefore would ſeduce men from truth to falſhord, and thereby to damnation with him: and what he cannot do with his falſe words, he ſeeks to execute by his falſe miracles and ſigns. The pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which he taught that young man, is at the end of Mr. <hi>John Thomaſon</hi>'s Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and hath been continually us'd in houſes in the ſame Town, where that young man lived; and I do in a manner believe there is ſome falſhood in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; he having continually heard it ſaid in that place. But if it be ſo, that Satan hath taught him it, he hath himſelf

Which fooliſh and falſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Satan is more worthy to be mocked and laughed at, then refuted; only hereby is perceived his power of ſeducing, wherewith, as in a net, he would have taken that poor people. The Pſalm which he commanded to be Sung when they Rowed out, was wholly needleſs; the Inhabitants never going to Sea, but they ſing that and other God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pſalms. The Prayer which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands

And when he hath brought them thus far, he knoweth himſelf powerful in their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and can lead them captive accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his will, from one error into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and at laſt make them believe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt lyes. It was already come ſo far with this poor people, that ſome cared but little for their Teachers, as appeareth

by what we have already ſaid, which God in his mercy forgive them, for they knew no better. This is the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous means whereby Satan can ſeduce men; whereby he ſteals the word out of their hearts, which is the only ſword wherewith they could put them to flight. By what is already ſaid the fooliſh and erronious arguments of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fall of themſelves, and are reduced to nothing, whereby one may ſee how eaſie it is to lead ſuch poor Sheep into errors, from whence they cannot come out, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept their Shepherd and Archbiſhop of their ſouls recall them by his ſervants.</p>
