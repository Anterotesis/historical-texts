            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Princes campe (according to the order reſolute aforeſayd) was in a perfect readineſſe, ringed in battels and ſquares, pitching the next morning the third of October, vppon a little hill néere to <hi>Mont gontour,</hi> well diſpoſed (as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſayd) to giue battel if the ennimie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced, who alſo began to appéere and diſcouer on the left hand vppon an other round hill, from the bottom wherof they might eaſily diſcern the diſpoſition of the Princes armye, which when he had well viewed, he retired his marche as though he ment to draw directly to <hi>Nyort,</hi> vſing notwithſtanding ſuch order as his rings and companies kept néere togither.

               <p>About the .xviij. day of this moneth, the Proteſtantes made an other ſallie by the gate <hi>d'Aulnis,</hi> and iſſuing out aboue the forte, they deſcended within the ditche by a ladder: there were of this faction (and conducted by Capteyn <hi>la Motte.</hi>) Cl. ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dioures with white ſhirtes aboue their garmentes, who charging ſo happily vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Suburbes <hi>d'Aulnis,</hi> founde the Catholykes playing at Cardes, and ſo withoute any watche to diſcouer them, they killed about thrée ſcore or foure ſcore Souldioures, and then retired vppon the falſe trenche of the ditche by the helpe of their harquebuſears, whiche were vppon the fort of the gate.

               <p>The Catholykes in the meane whyle drue neare their Artillerie whiche they

               <p>Thus the batterie beganne the xxij. daye of October, beating the Tower of the Towne neare to the <hi>Port d A'ulnis,</hi> and continued all the daye, and towarde night it enforced a breach a fortie or fiftie paſe wyde, wherevppon the Catholykes ſent one of their companie to viewe it, who being come to the brink of the ditch, and diſcouering hym ſelfe to ſuruey the breache, was killed with a ſhotte: ſo that

that daye paſſed without aſſaulte or any other ſpeciall attempte or acte. In the night the Proteſtantes with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence repaired their breache, and lette downe to the ditche certeyne labourers and Souldioures, to ryd awaye the ruyne and broken ſtuffe of the Wall falne into it.

               <p>From this batterie, the morrowe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came certeyne thunders of the Canon

               <p>Remouing the ſayd Canons to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of the Suburbes <hi>d'Aulnis,</hi> both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly before and alſo ſo neare the ſayde Fort, that onely the ditche was betwéene them.

The batterie continued all the daye, all that night, and all the nexte morrowe of one violent furie without ceaſing, ſo that both the Fort and the Portal (by whiche is the ordinarie entrie into the Towne) were almoſte beaten to pouder.</p>
               <p>In the meane whyle, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes made a couert waye betwéene

the Forte and the gate, to the ende, that the ruyne falling from the gate, ſhould not annoye nor hynder the entrey of the Fort.</p>
               <p>After this long and vehement bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, the L. <hi>de Guytinieres</hi> demaunded to ſpeake with the Proteſtantes, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the honoure and vertue of their word, entred the Towne the foure and twentie day of this moneth, aboute two of the Clocke at after noone. He laboured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to render the Towne, but the Lorde <hi>de Pilles</hi> remayned conſtant in his firſte aunſwere, that there could no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther price buy the Towne, than an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red peace, to the profitte and quiet of the Realme. Wherevppon the Lorde <hi>de Guitinieres</hi> returned againe and came to the Campe without other effecte of hys purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Hée was no ſooner out of the ſayde Towne, then the Catholykes ruſhed fiercely to the aſſaulte ſo vnlooked for, that the Proteſtantes doubted of their ſauetie, the rather bycauſe the aſſaulte was maynteyned as well at the breache

of the fort as on the right and left ſyde of it within the ditch, the better to come to the gate of the towne which they had battered (as you haue heard). And for their more eaſie comming to the breach of the forte, they had prouided great numbers of py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onners to beare ſackes full of earth and caſt them vpon the breach: who beſydes turning vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, threw ſtones againſt the proteſtantes, by which they greatly greued diuerſe of them: They preſented vpon the breach .vj. target men followed with a good number of ſhot, who albeit ventured farre to enforce the proteſtants, yet (being repulſed) they retyred without any great effects. This aſſault laſted from thrée of the clocke in the after noone tyll night, during the which was great waſte of ſhot and powder by the proteſtantes in ſuſtaining ſo hoat aſſault: in the nyght they fortified and repaired their breaches as well as they could, as they alſo for bare not to do euen in the tyme of the batterie, filling them vp as faſt as they were made with ſackes of dung. In thys night alſo they entrenched them ſelues within the fort, whereby the breaches, the morrow
