            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Beſides his Libertine falſe Doctrine, (as that the Covenant or Promiſe of Juſtification hath no Conditions, no not Faith, and ſuch like,) and abuſeth the Authors whom he citeth. I thought once to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed two or three days work in anſwering him, but I deſiſted, partly becauſe he was one of thoſe that had written at the rate of ſome former Adverſaries, who had ſo formed their Aſſaults, that they had left me little to anſwer but a <hi>Mentiris,</hi> which is ſo unpleaſing a task, that they that moſt deſerve it cannot bear it. And it hath been my lot ſince <hi>1662.</hi> in which the powerful Ringleader <hi>Morley</hi> began, to have ſo many ſuch Books written againſt me, and ſuch reports divulged of me, as if the Devil had been ſtudying to prove, <hi>Rom. 3.4. that every man is a Lyar,</hi> to be true in a ſenſe beyond the meaning, and to bring all Hiſtory at leaſt of Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into diſcredit, and to make it become a valid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence [<hi>It is ſaid and written by a domineering, or an ambitious, or an erroneous, or angry Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary</hi>; Ergo <hi>it is falſe.</hi>] And alſo I was loth to ſay that againſt the man that his Book required: For I hear he is a very honeſt man, and not only blind, but a ſufferer for Nonconformity with the reſt; and when he was a Child, his Grand-father, Grand-mother, and other kindred in <hi>Coventry</hi> were my hearers and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving friends, and godly people: His Father and Mother my very near Neighbours, and weekly, and almoſt daily company, have asked my Counſel, what they ſhould do with a blind Boy that was much inclined to Learning, and I encouraged them to further him, not foreſeeing his

He that gave me the Animadverſions anſwered in the end, told me, He had <hi>ſcarce patience to read him.</hi> And as to thoſe that are ſo weak as to need an anſwer to ſuch a Book, it's like they are too weak to underſtand one; or will think him in the right that hath the laſt word, and that may be he that liveth longeſt. The great fault of the good man is that which is too predominant in all Caſes in corrupted Nature, even an <hi>unhumbled under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> which doth not ſufficiently ſuſpect it ſelf, much leſs is acquainted with its own Ignorance, but when it moſt miſtaketh, doth moſt confidently rage. Who would think that ſuch a man could be ignorant how unfit he was who never ſaw their Books, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſuch account as he giveth of Fathers, Proteſtant Writers, or us his choſen Adverſaries? When his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hath read to him ſome parcels of our Writings, how knoweth he what he omitteth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or what explications he never read?

                  <head>The Prologue.</head>
                  <p>§. 1. THE Doctrine of the Juſtification of ſinful man, by Chriſt as our Redeemer, Saviour and Judge, is of ſo great moment, that it ſhould be Skilfully taught to all that are Catechiſed. And yet by the Unſkilfulneſs of Teachers, is become a foot-ball of Strife and Contention, and of Wrathful Cenſures, and Reproach, among thoſe who are moſt zealous for the ſafe and honourable preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and really differ more in the Terms and Methods which they think muſt preſerve it, than in the inward practical ſenſe of the matter it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. Two things conſtitute this itch or lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy rather of ſtrife, which experience maketh us fear is uncurable: And theſe two are one. <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>: Ignorance of the caſe: And Ignorance of our Ignorance. But what Ignorance is it? I am grieved to know and ſpeak it. It is Ignorance of <hi>words</hi> or the art of ſpeaking; of Grammar and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick. O what a plague did <hi>Nimrod</hi> bring on the World, and what a <hi>Babel</hi> hath it been by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of language to this day! How vain hath peaceable Dr. <hi>Wilkins</hi> attempt of an Univerſal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter proved? My good old highly valued Friend, Mr. <hi>John Eliots</hi> long ago wrote to me, that to make the <hi>Hebrew</hi> the Univerſal Language, and to ſet up a Godly Magiſtracy in the world were the two things yet to be done for Univerſal Concord and Reformation: Alas, good man? <hi>Abi in cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

&amp;c. If you can get the Earth to drink up the flood of Perſecution caſt out againſt you in <hi>New-England,</hi> it is well. Little did I think when I was a Schoolboy Learning my Grammar, that I ſhould live to find that the Chriſtian World is all in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Diviſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n, Wrath, Schiſm, War, and Blood, and much, if not moſtly for want of Skill in words or Grammar!</p>
                  <p>But indeed were there one Univerſal Language it would not be enough to heal us. For we are moſtly ſo dull of nature, &amp; ſo ſlothful in our Studies, and ſo apt to ſpeak as our parents or firſt Maſters or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ompany teach us, that we are utterly diſagreed and unreconcileable about the ſenſe of our ommon words in our Mother Tongue. So that if <hi>Engliſh</hi> were the only Language of the World, we ſhould ſtill be diſagreed: I have been a great comtemner of vain oſtentation in Critical or Verbal Skill: But I ſee that rightly uſed about things neceſſary, it muſt be a principal help to end moſt of our Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies.</p>
                  <p>§. 3. Though ſupernatural Revelation far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the meer light of Nature, and the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Creation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet the difficulty of learning and ſpeaking <hi>many</hi> Languages, without which we cannot Preach abroad in the World, and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Wars about words that take up and corrupt mankind, do make me read the 19 <hi>Pſalm.</hi> with great regard, and not think ſo hardly as I have been tempted to do, of Gods dealing with the heathen and generality of mankind, while the Heavens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the glory of God, and the firmament ſheweth his handy works, while day unto day utters Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and while Sun Moon, and Stars, do Preach God with ſo loud a voice, and their ſound goeth through all the World and there is no Nation or
<pb facs="tcp:66508:11"/>
Tongue where their ſound is not heard: And it is not a Syllable or Letter, an Accent or an Emphaſis, that doth obſcure their ſenſe. And they all tell the World that God is, and that he is the rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him. And that the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things of God are ſeen by the things that are made, and in him we live and move and have our being, and that in every Nation, he that feareth God and worketh righteouſneſs is accepted of him. It is moſt legible in the book of Nature, and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that God uſeth all the World upon terms of mercy, and not according to the utmoſt deſert of ſin; and that this mercy ſhould lead them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and that God is infinitely good, and therefore to be Loved above all: And that he that truly ſo loveth God, ſhall not lie in Hell and be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from him.</p>
                  <p>§ 4. Were it only Plow-men and other of the unlearned Vulgar that thus contended about words not underſtood, they had ſome excuſe: But it is thoſe that have from their Child-hood been bred up to learn the art of ſpeaking by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and School maſters, Books, and Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And when they have been thus tutor'd thirty or forty years, and exerciſed in Pulpits to the talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing art, and gloried in it; they are after all this the incendiaries of the world, for want of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to ſay.</p>
                  <p>Yea were it only men that underſtand not He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Greek, Latin or any Language ſave one, and were Skilful in that one, we might have ſome hope of ending this blind War. But it is kept up by our unſkilfulneſs in the Engliſh tongue, as well as of the Greek and Hebrew. Men have not brains and diligence to exclude Equivocals, or to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of their ſenſe; or to ſtate the ſence of their
<pb facs="tcp:66508:11"/>
terms before they diſpute. Nor to underſtand each others meaning, but fight in confuſion in the dark like the Phyſicians that let the Patient die, becauſe they could not agree whether he ſhould take <hi>ſucci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, Carabes, Electrum or Amber.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 5 Whither need we to go for an inſtance of this unhappineſs, but to our controverſies about Juſtification? How many Books, Sermons, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putings, and Back-biting Revilings, are employed about words neither explained nor underſtood! Raſh folly and confident rage beſeem not holy things, that ſhould be managed by Reverence and Diſcretion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Juſtification</hi> is loudly talkt of, by men that know not, or never tell you what the word ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or what the thing is: They never tell you whether they mean <hi>making Righteous Eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or if they name one ſence, they give us quite another when they are put to define it. Mr. <hi>Bradſhaws</hi> little Book is too big for their brains; becauſe the diſtinctions are ſo many when others by diſtinction and clear explication make the Controverſies intelligible, (as is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently done by many) they underſtand them not, or deſpiſe diſtinction, and ſtill mouth out the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous word <hi>Juſtification,</hi> as if they would end Controverſies as a Bell Ringeth by <hi>Sound</hi> and <hi>Noiſe:</hi> When <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.7, 8. <hi>That even things without life muſt give a diſtinction in the Sounds as
<pb facs="tcp:66508:12"/>

                  <p n="2">2. So they talk much of <hi>Imputation,</hi> and neither know nor tell you what <hi>Imputation</hi> is: But take it moſtly to be that which even Dr. <hi>Criſpe</hi> calleth a charging God with falſhood; as if it were his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Reckoning, Eſteeming or Suppoſing us to be what indeed we are not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to have done or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what we did not, or to have what we have not: Whereas <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth nothing (&amp; <gap reason="foreign">

And to impute righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to us, ſignifieth but truly to Repute, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count or Judge us Righteous. Thoſe that are here moſt inclined to miſtake, ſhould the rather take Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> to be impartial, becauſe he was for Independent Church Government (tho ſharp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Separation.) And in the Preface to his Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Edition of his little Book of Juſtification, he hath in a few lines ſaid enough to end al this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, by a true explaining in what ſenſe Chriſts Righteouſneſs is imputed to us, and how not.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And do they tell us with any agreement what Righteouſneſs of Chriſt they call Imputed? Some ſay only the Paſſive, ſome alſo the Active; Some alſo the habitual, and ſome alſo the Divine. Much leſs agree they to what Effects it is imputed, and how far.</p>

                     <hi>Faith</hi> meaneth not <hi>Faith,</hi> but Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Another calls it an Inſtrument, and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth it to be the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>credere</hi> that is, the Act of Faith indeed, as if any thing elſe was that inſtrument. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſaith it is but one Phyſical act, and not like contracting, a Moral complication of many Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Acts: One ſaith it is but one Act, and all other Acts of Faith he that looketh to be Juſtified by denieth the Doctrine of Grace or true Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and ſo leave men to deſpair becauſe they can never tell which that ſingle is, and how to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the damning Doctrine of Juſtification by works. One ſaith it is the Underſtandings aſſent: Another that it is the Wills recumbency, or truſt: One ſaith it is only Faith in Chriſt that Juſtifieth, and not in God the Father or the Holy Ghoſt: One ſaith it is only Faith in Chriſts Prieſtly Office, and not in Chriſt as Prophet or King; ſome ſay it is not Faith in his whole Prieſtly Office, either his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion or Heavenly Prieſthood, but only in his Sacrifice and Obedience. Another that it is only the truſting on his Imputed Righteouſneſs: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that it is none of all theſe, but only the belief that we are already Juſtified by Chriſt. One ſaith we are Juſtified only at once by the firſt numerical Act of Faith, and never by any after Act: Another that an Act of the ſame Species continueth our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. And this confuſion is from the vain fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſy of men, that will divide and mince and yet will not ſufficiently diſtinguiſh: and know not that by Faith is meant our becoming Chriſtians and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſuch.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. So they talk loud againſt <hi>Works</hi> in the Caſe of Juſtification, and know not what either <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>James</hi> or Chriſt meaneth by <hi>works.</hi> But they dream that <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> are of the ſame ſignification;
<pb facs="tcp:66508:13"/>
As if every humane Act were that which <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth by <hi>works,</hi> contrary to his expreſs explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And ſo to be Juſtified by Faith muſt be to be Juſtified by Works. One ſaith, we will grant Juſtification by Faith, if you take it aright, to be a going wholly out of our ſelves and denying all our own righteouſneſs, and going to Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs alone. But is their choſen Metaphor [of <hi>Going out,</hi> and <hi>Going to</hi>] an <hi>Act</hi> or no <hi>Act</hi>? If an Act, than it is <hi>works,</hi> if they may be believed. If <hi>no Act,</hi> then their meaning is, <hi>we confeſs that you are Juſtified</hi> by <hi>Believing,</hi> if <hi>you do not believe: You are Juſtified by Faith, if Faith be nothing; and by coming to Chriſt</hi> if <hi>you come not to him,</hi> or <hi>it be nothing.</hi> Such is the ſence of theſe Confounders and Corrupters.</p>
                  <p>But theſe and many ſuch miſtakes are to be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their proper place.</p>
                  <p>That which I here intend is (not a confutation of this or that writer, but) to give them a breviate of my own Judgment, who will not read what I have largely written in many books long ago<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that the length of the books is their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and yet have not ſo much conſcience as to ſuſpend their cenſures, no nor their back-biting, falſe accuſations of that which they have not leiſure to underſtand or read; They judge hard caſes which they never digeſted by any anſwerable Study; and Scruple not Judging and Slandering per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Corrupting the Goſpel, and ſo excellent a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as the Doctrine of Grace, and of the Office and Merits and Judgment of Chriſt, and ſo of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity it ſelf, is a matter that conſcience ſhould more tenderly fear, than wearing a Surplice, or kneeling at the Sacrament, or communicating with a Church that uſeth the Common-Prayers. To think thoſe

unworthy of their Communion that uſe ſuch Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies or forms of prayer, and at the ſame time to prophane ſo high a part of the name of God, as is his Grace in Chriſt, and his Juſtifying, Governing and Saving works, and this (<hi>quoad verba</hi>) by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting it even in Eſſentials, and then to defame as erroneous thoſe that are not as Ignorant and Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous as themſelves, and to foment malice and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Sects by ſuch lying defamations: This is a Nonconformity which I earneſtly deſire that no man that loveth Chriſt, or Free grace, or the Church or his own Soul; may ever take for his duty or his honour, or raſhly as a ſequacious admirer of any miſtaken leader be ever guilty of: What is ſtraining at a Gnat and ſwallowing a Camel, if this be not? And of how ill a conſtitution is ſuch a blind and partial conſcience?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Pr.</hi> 1. WE muſt firſt agree, what <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is. Righteouſneſs</hi> is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally a <hi>Relation</hi>: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt have the definition of a Relation: I need not tell Schollars what that is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſubject of this Relation, is, firſt mens <hi>actions</hi> and <hi>habits,</hi> and their <hi>Titles</hi> and <hi>Rights,</hi> and then their <hi>Perſons</hi> as the ſubject of theſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Righteouſneſs is a Relation to the Rule or Law: And is an Agreeableneſs thereto: If it be Gods Law, it is Righteouſneſs before God. If but <hi>mans,</hi> it is but humane Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As a Law hath two parts; the precept and the retribution of reward and puniſhment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo there are two ſorts of unrighteouſneſs and righteouſneſs: As to the precept, Obedience is Righteouſneſs, and Sin is Unrighteouſneſs. As to the Retributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Right to Impunity and to the promiſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is the Perſons Righteouſneſs, and ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Righteouſneſs materially is either, 1. <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,</hi> in ſome one cauſe, or few cauſes, 2. Or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> and perfect in all cauſes.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Righteouſneſs particular is either in ſome ſmall matter that we are not made happy by. 2. Or in ſome great cauſe which our happineſs dependeth on.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The firſt Law required perſonal perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant obedience on pain of death; and ſo juſtifieth none without it.</p>

                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:66508:17"/>8. <hi>Adam</hi> was the Father of all mankind, from whom they ſpring, but he did not ſo repreſent the Perſons of all that were to ſpring of him, as if his obedience without their own would have juſtified any of them at age. If <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> ſhould have been condemned if he ſinned; and ſo others.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The firſt Law being broken, man was made uncapable of either part of Juſtification by it; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as one that ſinned not, or as one that was not by it to be condemned. And ſo it was no more to him a Promiſe or Covenant of Life; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition being now become impoſſible, and ſo no condition; and the threatning becoming as a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. This Law neither gave, mentioned or own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any Surety, Subſtitute, or Mediator.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. But the bleſſed Lawgiver our Creator would not ſo loſe his Creature, but the eternal word pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently interpoſing, undertook mans Redemption, and God gave man a new Law of Life, or a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> promiſing him a Mediator in the fullneſs of time, and giving him freely for his ſake both pardon of his ſin, and right to Life, on the Terms of Grace therein preſcribed: and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him future obedience, eſpecially in the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Grace, and uſe of the <hi>means</hi> of Grace appointed him.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. This Law of Grace was made to <hi>Adam</hi> the lapſed head of all mankind, and ſo to all mankind in him: And it was renewed to <hi>Noah</hi> in the ſame capacity: ſo that all fallen mankind was put under this Law of Grace in that firſt Edition of it, made to <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Noah.</hi> And were neither left law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, nor utterly deſperate as under the meer damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violated Law, which now no more offered

The world was not from Eternity: God did not make it from Eternity, nor was the creator of it from Eternity, in proper ſpeech. And yet no Act as it is in God had beginning or end; for it is God himſelf. But Gods Eſſential will or word is not called <hi>creating</hi> till it actually create. So is it in Juſtification: Nothing is new in God, beſides <hi>Relation</hi> and <hi>Denomination</hi>; but much is new <hi>by and from God.</hi> Juſtification is a tranſient act of God. It is the act of his <hi>Covenant</hi> and his <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Execution.</hi> Therefore he that ſaith Elect Infidels are Juſtified from Eternity, Contradicteth Gods word, that ſaith we are juſtified by faith, and till then are under Condemnation.</p>

I have rendred a multitude of reaſons to prove this in my Treatiſe of <hi>Juſtifying Righteouſneſs:</hi> The contradiction is enough that we are accounted ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to have ſinned, becauſe Chriſt never ſinned; and yet we are accounted to have ſuffered or ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for ſin, becauſe Chriſt did ſo; or at leaſt that we need a pardon by his blood, and muſt ask for pardon, and muſt ſuffer correcting puniſhments, and long be without neceſſary grace and glory, when yet we are accounted never to have ſinned, but from birth to death to have fulfilled all Gods Law in Chriſt.

In a Union Specifick of humanity, all mankind is one with Chriſt that is, of one Species of humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And ſo that which is predicated of one as ſuch, is predicated of the other.</p>
                  <p>In a <hi>Political <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> Chriſt as the head, and the Church as the body make one Society as <hi>parts</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting the whole. And ſo whatever is predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated of a <hi>part</hi> meerly as a <hi>part,</hi> is predicable of both: But that which is predicated of the whole as a whole is properly predicable of neither alone: And that which is predicated of the Head as a head, is not predicable of the body, nor that of the head, which is proper to the body, nor that of one member which is proper to another. But ſome things by way of Communication may be predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66508:29"/>
of the whole, for the ſake of a part. So the Church is called ſinful and imperfect for our ſake, though Chriſt be not ſo: And it is eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy and glorious, becauſe Chriſt is ſo; that is, <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum quid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But no <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> will make us <hi>righteous</hi> and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally <hi>happy</hi> by anothers righteouſneſs and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, unleſs it were a perſonal Union, (natural or Legal at leaſt as to Relative rights.) The queſtion then is whether <hi>every believer be one perſon with Chriſt?</hi> And if ſo, whether one <hi>natural perſon,</hi> or one <hi>Legal</hi> (as a lawful <hi>vicarius</hi> is.) They that hold the firſt plead that the ſame Spirit that is in Chriſt, is the ſame divine nature, and maketh us one natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſon. But where doth the Scripture ſay ſo? The Sun is not one Individual with every Plant that it quickeneth, nor every plant with it. A net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or roſe is not the Sun, nor is it the illuminater of the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that maketh day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But they have ſo much from the Sun as it communicateth, and no more. So we are not Chriſt, nor the Eternal and Natural Son of God, nor infinite in Wiſdom and Goodneſs, nor perfectly juſt and glorified, as Chriſt is: But we have from Chriſt ſo much of the Spirit as he communicateth; And nothing is ours meerly becauſe it is his, and we one perſon with him; but becauſe he Communicateth it to us: What further real Union there will be in our glorious perfection we cannot well know till we are there. But in this imperfection our Union is not ſuch as far as I underſtand it, as maketh us one natural perſon with Chriſt; And ſurely it doth not make his proper accidents to be our acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>
                  <p>And as to that which ſome call a Legal or Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative perſonal Union, it muſt be proved before it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66508:30"/>
is aſſerted. And as I know no word of God that ſpeaketh ſuch a thing, as that Chriſt and we are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putatively one perſon; ſo I know that they that will aſſent it of their own heads, preſume far in a tender point; and if they ſhould ſay that we are <hi>ſimply</hi> and <hi>ad omnia</hi> one perſon, it were not by Chriſtian ears to be endured: If they will ſay that it is but in ſome reſpects and to ſome certain uſes, (as a Servant that payeth his Maſters creditor by order in ſome ſenſe repreſenteth him in that one action) they muſt limit it carefully and ſhew to what uſes we are one perſon, leſt they do they know not what: And they muſt ſhew what ſort of perſon they mean? Whether Chriſt be made the ſame perſon with each believing ſinner, and ſo take our bad denominations; or each ſinner be made the perſon of Chriſt; and have his glorious deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, or a third ſort of perſon is made of both, and what that is? If meer perſonal Unity make us righteous by imputation, becauſe Chriſt is ſo, either it muſt be as Chriſt is righteous, in full perfection (reputatively) or elſe but according to the meaſure of our receptivity: The firſt none will affirm that underſtand what they ſay: And the ſecond brings the effect no higher than we grant; The foot doth not underſtand as the head doth, though it be a part of the ſame natural body, and may have its peculiar Ulcers and Diſeaſes: A crab and a ſweet apple may grow on the ſame Tree: Certainly we have a perſon proper to our ſelves, which hath its own defects and evils, and hath no more from Chriſt than he communicateth.</p>
                  <p>Cont. 10. <hi>Are we not righteous by being one with Chriſt, as we are ſinners by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with</hi> Adam?</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Nay our derivation from <hi>Adam</hi> was by <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> but from Chriſt by his <hi>voluntary Gift and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</hi>

                  <p>Our radical righteouſneſs in <hi>Adam</hi> would have happily diſpoſed us to perſonal obedience; as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> himſelf was who yet fell: And our radical righteouſneſs in Chriſt, is yet a more happy prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative to our neceſſary duty to him, which is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs alſo, which he that hath not ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. I know that many ſay that if <hi>Adam</hi> had conquered that temptation, or at leaſt had never ſinned, all his poſterity ſhould have been confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt all future ſin and danger as the Angels be in Heaven: But I dare not add to the Word of God; and I find no ſuch thing there, though I hear what others ſay: And if that were true, the firſt Covenant would have ceaſed upon <hi>Adams</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as it did upon his diſobedience, and all the World would have been under either no Law, or ſome Law to us unknown.

it by him muſt have judged accordingly: For ſin, &amp; eſpecially the ſins of ſo many millions &amp; ſo great, muſt needs render him whoſe own they are, really ſinful, hateful and miſerable. Any of which to ſay of Chriſt is blaſphemy.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt undertook that guilt of our ſin which is nothing but the obligation to puniſhment, and that ſuch puniſhment as beſeemed him to undergo. There is a <hi>

Chriſt condeſcended to the admiration of Angels in taking on him our nature, and our puniſhment, and ſuffering for our ſins; but his holineſs would not ſuffer him to undertake our ſin it ſelf, or take it to be his own ſin. Nay conſidering the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of attributes which Divines aſſert from the hypoſtatical Union, men ſhould tremble to think of laying a ground of calling it <hi>The Sin of God,</hi> by the ſame reaſon as, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. it's ſaid, [<hi>The blood of God.</hi>] Its a ſad caſe that partiality can ſo much prevail, as that they that cry out of ſome doubtful words as damnable hereſies, do yet think it tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble language to ſay, that by Imputation of the very ſin itſelf to Chriſt as his ſin, he was the greateſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the greateſt Murderer, Lyer, Adulterer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the world. I beſeech you abſtain from ſuch words till you find them in the Scripture. Chriſt never was reputed of God a ſinner, who did ſo much to ſhew his hatred of it. Nor ever took our ſin unto him, any further than to ſuffer for it to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate it: And if this be the ſimilitude by which we muſt underſtand how his <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi>

is made ours, it will make all very plain. It is ours, or imputed to us, ſo far as to be reputed the true cauſe of our Juſtification, Adoption, Sanctification and Glory, as our ſin was the cauſe of his ſuffering and death.</p>
                  <p>Cont. 12. <hi>Doth not Chriſts righteouſneſs cauſe our Sanctification in the ſame ſort of cauſality as it cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our Juſtification?</hi>

                  <p>Cont. 13. <hi>When it is ſaid that faith is imputed to us for righteouſneſs is it faith indeed that is meant or Chriſts Righteouſneſs believed on?</hi>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> A ſtrange and bold queſtion. What occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath the Holy Ghoſt given us to raiſe ſuch a ſuſpicion, that when it is ſo often ſaid by him that <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>imputed</hi> or <hi>accounted</hi> for <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> men ſhould make a doubt whether it be Faith indeed that he meaneth? If it be not, the context is ſo far from relieving our underſtandings, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributeth to our unavoidable deceit or ignorance. Read over the Texts and put but [<hi>Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi>] every where inſtead of the word [<hi>Faith</hi>;] and ſee what a ſcandalous Paraphraſe you will make. The Scripture is not ſo audaciouſly to be Corrected: It's wiſer to believe Gods Word than to contradict it on pretence of expounding it.</p>
                  <p>Obj. <hi>But it is ſaid alſo that Righteouſneſs is imputed: And that muſt be either Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> We are not now queſtioning whether <hi>Chriſts Righteouſneſs be imputed to us</hi>: Though it be not the Phraſe of the Scripture, I have ſhewed you that it is true, in a ſound ſence, But the queſtion is, <hi>Whether Faith be imputed for righteouſneſs.</hi> And what is the meaning of all ſuch Texts? To <hi>have righteouſneſs imputed to us,</hi> plainly ſignifieth to be Reckoned, Accounted, Reputed or Judged righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And it's ſtrange that it muſt not be our <hi>own righteouſneſs,</hi> that is imputed or reckoned to us as our own: If it were never ſo well proved, that the very Habits and Acts of Chriſt are by Gift or Union made our own in themſelves, and not only as the cauſes of their effects, yet ſtill <hi>our own</hi> they would be, and the righteouſneſs given by them our own, in order of nature before they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, accounted or reckoned to us as our own. Some way that righteouſneſs which is reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>conſtitute</hi> us righteous is ſurely made our own.</p>

And of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Juſtification God <hi>ſaith, Becauſe thou haſt done this,</hi> &amp;c. What man that ever read the Bible can doubt, but that every man that will be ſaved muſt have a perſonal faith, repentance and holineſs, which is called righteouſneſs many hundred times in the Scripture, beſides the righteouſneſs that was or is in Chriſt? And will not God reckon him righteous that is righteous? He that doth righteouſneſs is righteous? And ſhall it not be imputed to him? if God account not a man a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, can he be juſtified and ſaved? Chriſts Righteouſneſs hath made Satisfaction for all our ſins, and for our unrighteouſneſs as to the Law that doth condemn us: But he made us not lawleſs,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:66508:33"/>
but put us under a Law of Grace, which ſaith [<hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved, and he that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not ſhall be damned.</hi>] And muſt we not be judged by this Law? and be juſtified or condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as we keep or break it? wonderful is the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of prejudice that any good men that read the Scripture can doubt whether Chriſt himſelf hath made us a Law of Grace, according to which as performers or non-performers we muſt be juſtified as righteous in ſubordination to Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs or elſe be condemned, as neglecters of ſo great Salvation? Is any thing plainer in all the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel?</p>
                  <p>Obj. <hi>But it is the Object, and not the Act; Chriſts Righteouſneſs and not our Faith; the Gold and not the Hand that taketh it, that is our Riches and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi>

and the Kings Act be their Title to it.</p>
                  <p>Faith is reckoned or imputed to be that which by the Redeemer himſelf is required of the Sinner to make him partaker of Chriſt and his Benefits, Reconciliation and Salvation; and it is no other Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>Chriſts Righteouſneſs is not imputed to us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of our <hi>Faith</hi> and Repentance and ſincere ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, which is made by himſelf the condition of Life. As he died not for the Sins which we were never guilty of, and are no ſins, ſo his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not inſtead of that Righteouſneſs which by his Grace <hi>we have,</hi> but inſtead of that which we <hi>have not:</hi> Not inſtead of our being <hi>penitent Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> and <hi>ſanctified before we die,</hi> but inſtead of that perfect innocency which we want: Not that we are reputed <hi>perfect innocent obeyers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> becauſe he was ſuch; but that our want of it ſhall not hinder our Juſtification or Adoption, Grace or Glory.

                  <p>The purchaſe then and Donation is by Chriſt, but the <hi>voluntary acceptance</hi> is by us, by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Grace; which is not to make up any deficiency in Chriſts part, or to be a ſupplement to his Righteouſneſs, nor to bear any part of the ſame office in our Juſtification; but it's that which ſubordinately is required of us as the Condition of Pardon and Life, by his own Law or Covenant of Grace. And ſo far it is imputed to us for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</p>

He ſuffered not many temptations, which yet by the merit of his ſufferings we are freed from. 2. He ſuffered not many relative evils, as bad Parents, bad Teachers, a bad Wife, and all the attendant croſſes in buying and ſelling, croſſes from bad Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, or Landlords, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the merit of his ſuffering delivereth many from. 3.

Nor the final Sentence [<hi>Go ye curſed into everlaſting fire.</hi>] 8. Nor the proper Execution of that Sentence.</p>
                  <p>Yet he delivereth ſome Believers from all theſe, and all from ſome, by the merits of his ſufferings.

                     <p n="4">IV. That Chriſt did obey and ſuffer, merit and ſatisfy, in ſo full and ſtrict a repreſenting and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonating every one of the Elect, as that they did and ſuffered it in and by Chriſt, in the ſence of the Law of Works, or in Gods account: and that it was not in the third perſon of a mediator, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the Effects freely as he pleaſed by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Covenant. And ſo that Gods imputing righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to us, is his accounting us to have done and ſuffered in Law ſenſe what Chriſt did.

                  <head>An Anſwer to ſome Animadverſions of a Friend, tending to the further expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſome paſſages which through brevity were not underſtood.</head>
                  <p>§. 1. SIR, Your notes have ſo much Judgment and moderation and ſo little, if any thing contrary to what I aſſert, that they require nothing from me, but a repeated explication of that which you obſerved not as before explained: But when it is enough for me to explain my <hi>own</hi> Words and Doctrine, you put me on another task to ſeek after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of another mans; which I am not oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to on any account, but for your Satisfaction. It is enough for me to ſpeak true Doctrine in the moſt intelligible manner that I can without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining whether other mens expreſſions be ſound or apt.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. I begin with your own Notes: And 1. I hope that few are ſo ignorant (that meddle in theſe matters) as to doubt of what you ſay, that no one term much leſs one Metaphor or ſimilitude can adequately expreſs any of the Myſteries of Grace, and no one Metaphor muſt be carried too far; <hi>Omne ſimile eſt etiam diſſimile</hi>: And all ſet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo far as they are thereto intended muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us.</p>
                  <p>§. 3. I know none but the Socinians that think a Mediator and a Sponſor inconſiſtent; or deny Chriſt to be a Sponſor. And methinks your words
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66508:54"/>
for their conſiſtency, import a greater difference between them than there is. It is part of Chriſts Mediation to be a Sponſor: Theſe terms there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expreſs no difference but between the <hi>whole</hi> and the <hi>part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what a <hi>Sponſor</hi> Chriſt is, is all the doubt which I a little opened, and you paſs by. It is not agreed by expoſitors what the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in that one only place of Scripture where it is uſed. Very learned expoſitors think that as <hi>Moſes</hi> was called <hi>Gods Mediator</hi> or <hi>Sponſor</hi> to <hi>the people</hi> as being his Spokeſman and in his name aſſuring them that this was Gods Covenant which he would perform, and returning the peoples anſwer to God, and praying for them but not undertaking for them, and perſonating them; ſo Chriſt is here likened to him, and called the <hi>Mediator</hi> and <hi>Sponſor</hi> of the new and better Covenant, not as he perſonateth or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh for Covenanting Subjects, but only as he repreſenteth God the Father to man, and is his Sponſor to us.</p>
                  <p>But as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he is not a Mediator of one, ſo I ſee not but (though chiefly he be Gods Sponſor to man) yet withal he be there called a <hi>Sponſor</hi> alſo as well as a Mediator for man to God: But all the doubt is what a <hi>Sponſor</hi> for man he is.</p>
                  <p>And firſt we muſt enquire what Covenant he is a Sponſor of? No doubt but Gods Covenant with the Mediator as ſuch, is <hi>one,</hi> and Gods and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators Covenant with man ſolemnized in baptiſm is another: And yet no doubt but theſe two have ſuch relation as that in ſome ſort or reſpect they may be called one. He that ſaith they are not two is plainly confuted by the conſtitutive defining parts, the <hi>Divers Parties, Matter, Terms</hi> and <hi>Ends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was not ſaid to Chriſt, but by Chriſt, <hi>[Repent
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:66508:54"/>
and believe in Chriſt, or be damned.]</hi> Pardon and Salvation are not offered to Chriſt to be received by Faith in himſelf. Yet as the Laws of the Land though ſeveral, are <hi>One Inſtrumentum Regiminis</hi>: So we call all the Laws of Nature uſually ſingularly. <hi>The Law of Nature,</hi> (and ſo we ſay, <hi>The Civil Law, the Canon Law, Gods Law,</hi> &amp;c.) Now the queſtion is, what Covenant Chriſt was the Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of? 1. In his own proper Covenant he did <hi>Spondere &amp; praeſtare,</hi> to ſuffer for us, and to obey for us, (in the juſt ſence in due place explained,) to riſe and aſcend for us, to intercede for us, to Teach us, Guide us, give out his Spirit, and to Juſtifie and Sanctifie and Glorifie his choſen: So that it was part of his <hi>Undertaking</hi> and <hi>Performance</hi> to do all this <hi>for us</hi>; and this may well be called his becoming a <hi>Sponſor</hi> for us, and to be <hi>made to us, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In our Covenant with Chriſt, he is the <hi>Impoſer</hi> and <hi>Stipulator,</hi> and we are to Promiſe for our part, to be done by his promiſed help. But on <hi>Gods part,</hi> it is in <hi>this</hi> that he is the Sponſor, and not in the <hi>former,</hi> where God the Father is the Promiſer to Chriſt, and not Chriſt to himſelf as a Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: So that it is in <hi>one Covenant</hi> that he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <hi>to God for Man,</hi> and in <hi>another</hi> that he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <hi>for God to Man</hi>: And the queſtion is which of theſe Covenants it is that the Apoſtle calleth him the Surety of? If you ſay that the Apoſtle taketh both here as parts of <hi>One,</hi> and ſo meaneth both; I find no proof of this in the Text: And if it were ſo, it is all one; for it were then ſpoken of the <hi>whole,</hi> but reſpectively to what Chriſt did in the two which are the <hi>parts</hi>: Indeed it is <gap reason="foreign">

And ſo it is the Fathers Sponſor and Mediator to man that is meant here directly, and mans Sponſor and Mediator towards God by Connotation; but ſo as in other Texts, as <hi>Cap.</hi> 9.15. that part alſo is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly expreſſed, and Chriſts death made a part of his Mediation.</p>
                  <p>§ 4. The Queſtion being not then whether Chriſt be <hi>Mediator,</hi> or <hi>Sponſor,</hi> or the <hi>Second A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> but what theſe words ſignifie, that which is to be noted by the Reader is, 1. What it is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that we aſſert; and whether that be enough. 2. And what it is that we deny as too much, and falſe.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. There is a ſubſequent Sponſor that was not before bound, but as a Friend after interpoſeth, and offereth (not in the Perſon of the debtor, but yet in his ſtead) to pay the debt: and this upon ſuch terms as to the Debtors deliverance as he thinks beſt; and ſo may take him as Debtor to himſelf, and put various limits, and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon his Diſcharge: And ſuch a Sponſor is Chriſt for Man.

                  <p>And if Chriſts <hi>Habitual</hi> Perfection be alſo ſo imputed to us, in a Legal ſenſe, we were <hi>habitually</hi> perfect from birth to death.

typified: The Law as a Law doth only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and threaten and promiſe life to them that do all things written, but gave not grace to do it. The Jews left out the true ſence of the types and promiſe which intended the Meſſiah, in whom it was that the promiſſory part of the Law was made; and thought the very task of duty or works would procure their acceptance and pardon when they failed. If you are not ſatisfied with this reaſon why <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it the <hi>Law of Works,</hi> find out a better if you can: But moſt certainly that is a great miſtake that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribe the Law of Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?

                  <p>§ 9. Your next queſtion is about the <hi>nature of Faith, whether if it be placed in the will, and include conſent, it be not confounded with Love, whoſe object is goodneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have anſwered this oft and largely in divers Books, and therefore muſt here be excuſed from ſaying any more than this, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. You muſt diſtinguiſh between Faith Phyſically taken, and Faith morally taken. 2. Between its formal act and its material.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Phyſically ſome one natural act, conſtituted by one Object is called <hi>Faith</hi>: But morally taken it comprehendeth divers Phyſical Acts, both of the Intellect and Will: And as it is Juſtifying and Saving it is ſo taken: Yea morally it is ſometime in Scripture taken largelier, for our Chriſtian Faith, as God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt the Promiſe, Grace and Glory are all the conſtituting Objects of it in their truth and goodneſs; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time more narrowly as altogether diſtinct from Hope and Love; It is taken in the firſt ſenſe when it is ſaid to be the condition of Juſtification and Salvation.</p>
                  <p>And here what you ſaid of the neceſſity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning the many ſimilitudes which expreſs Chriſts
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66508:62"/>
Office to us, when but <hi>one</hi> of them in a Text is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the ſame muſt be ſaid of Faith in Chriſt. A Moral act which hath many Phyſical acts, muſt be named by ſome <hi>one,</hi> the reſt being connoted or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; for it would be uncomely to name them all in every mention of it.</p>
                  <p>Note alſo, that the name is varied according to what is ſpecially noted in the Object, ſometime Truth, ſometime Goodneſs: So Chriſt ſaith, [<hi>The Father hath loved you, becauſe ye have loved me.</hi> And <hi>Paul, Grace be to all them that love the Lord Jeſus in ſincerity. If any man love not the Lord Jeſus, let him be</hi> Anathema Maranatha. And Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. <hi>He that loveth any better than Chriſt, cannot be his Diſciple.</hi> And to be a <hi>Diſciple,</hi> a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> and a <hi>Believer,</hi> are all one in Scripture. But when it is the Goodneſs of <hi>another Object</hi> that is mentioned, the Act is another thing.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe you will confeſs that no Faith in Chriſt and the Promiſe juſtifieth us, which doth not in that ſame inſtant include, 1. A belief of the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as well as the Truth of both. 2. A willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to receive Chriſt and Grace as good; and a conſent to the offer. And if theſe muſt concur in the ſame inſtant as neceſſary Conditions of our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification or Reception of Chriſt and Grace, call them how you will, and ſay, <hi>Conſent</hi> is an <hi>Effect</hi> of Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or a <hi>part</hi> of it, all's one to me: But I will ſay, that <hi>Conſent is an Effect of one Act of Faith ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken</hi>; viz. <hi>Aſſent</hi>; but a <hi>part of it</hi> taken for <hi>Juſtifying, Saving Faith.</hi>

                  <p n="2">II. After many and long thoughts of this matter, I think they that will pretend to exactneſs, muſt ſay, that <hi>Truſt</hi> is the <hi>Formal Act</hi> of Faith, as <hi>Truſtineſs</hi> or <hi>Fidelity</hi> is the <hi>Formal Object:</hi> And that the <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:66508:64"/>
This is the point which Mr. <hi>Lawſon</hi> and I ſeemed ſomewhat to differ about: And I have in my Treatiſe of Juſtification ſaid ſo much of it, that you ſhall now excuſe me from any more than telling you, that in Sanctification, where one act really produceth one effect on our hearts, and another act another effect, each effect muſt be aſcribed to its proper act. But you muſt not think it is ſo in our Juſtification or Adoption, where that which we receive is a <hi>RIGHT, Jus impunitatis &amp; vitae,</hi> which is not the <hi>Immediate Effect</hi> of our <hi>Act,</hi> no nor <hi>any Effect of it</hi> at all, but of <hi>Gods Donative Covenant,</hi> of which our Faith is but a <hi>Condition,</hi> and no <hi>Efficient Cauſe</hi> of our <hi>Right.</hi> And therefore I doubt not ſtill to ſay, that we are <hi>thus juſtified</hi> as much by a <hi>Conſenting to Chriſts Teaching and Sanctifying Grace,</hi> as by <hi>Conſenting to be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Righteouſneſs</hi>; or by fiducial taking him for our Teacher, Interceſſor and King, as taking him for a Satisfier and Meriter for us: Indeed it is undivided Taking Chriſt as Chriſt, that is the Juſtifying Condition, <hi>John</hi> 1.10, 11, 12. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10, 11, 12.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The meaning is, <hi>By the Merit of Chriſts Active and Paſſive</hi> (yea <hi>Habitual</hi>) <hi>Righteouſneſs (alſo) exalted in dignity by his Divine Perfection, all faln Mankind is Conditionally pardoned, and hath the gift of Life, enacted in the Law or Covenant of Grace, and all true Believers have by that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant actually given them a Right of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt, and with him Pardon and Adoption, or Right to Grace and Glory, and have the Spirit of Holineſs

as the firſt fruits.</hi> All this is included in that Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>§ 12. Laſtly, you ask, <hi>What Righteouſneſs Faith is imputed to? Whether that which is by Chriſts obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and by Faith, be the ſame? and perfect or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect?</hi>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here alſo you may take the blame that I ſay things long ago ſo oft ſaid. By <hi>Righteous</hi> is meant <hi>Juſtifiable</hi> in general: And the plain meaning is, <hi>Chriſt having merited, and freely given Pardon and Life to all ſinners that will fiducially accept his purchaſed Gift, it is not now keeping the Law of Innocency or Works, but only the ſaid fiducial Acceptance of Chriſt and his free Grace that is required on their part to their Right or Juſtification.</hi> If by <hi>Imputed</hi> we meant, <hi>Reputing it the MATTER of our total Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> then it were an unſound ſenſe.

For <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> to be <hi>imputed,</hi> is meant no more, but that <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But 2. <hi>De re</hi> here is no Explication how <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is giving,</hi> or <hi>how Righteouſneſs is given us</hi>: There is no queſtion but all the Righteouſneſs that we have is given us by God: But the very heart of the Controverſie is, <hi>How the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is given us and made ours:</hi> In that Righteouſneſs is found, 1. The <hi>Matter.</hi> 2. The <hi>Form.</hi> 1. The <hi>matter</hi> is, 1. The <hi>Habits.</hi> 2. <hi>The Acts</hi> of Chriſt in the Divine and Humane Nature: Are <hi>theſe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us,</hi> and do we poſſeſs them in themſelves? The <hi>Acts</hi> are <hi>paſt,</hi> and ſo are <hi>nothing now:</hi> and nothing is no bodies actual poſſeſſion. The <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Habits</hi> were <hi>Accidents</hi> which <hi>ſine interitu</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paſs from Subject to Subject: Divers Subjects prove diverſity of Accidents. 2. The <hi>Form</hi> is a <hi>Relation,</hi> and ſo an Accident alſo: And they muſt needs be two Accidents, that are Formal Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in Chriſt and us, unleſs we are the ſame Subject Perſon. Therefore neither matter nor Relative form in Chriſt and Man is the ſame individual Accident. How then is it ours! What is there in it beſides matter (the ſubject and <hi>fundamentum</hi>) and form? it's plain that, 1. The <hi>Benefits are given us,</hi> and are <hi>our own</hi> by that <hi>Gift</hi>: All that conſiſt <hi>in jure, in right,</hi> (as
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:66508:66"/>
to Chriſt, to the Love of the reconciled Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Communion of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> to further Grace, Pardon, Glory) are all given us inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally by the new Covenants donative Act: The inherent habits, and the Acts are given us by the Holy Ghoſt. And 2. Theſe Benefits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given us for the Sacrifice, and Merits of Chriſt, the <hi>price</hi> is ſaid by a <hi>Metonymy</hi> of the <hi>cauſe for the Effect,</hi> to be <hi>given us,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>given for us</hi>: It was <hi>God the Father</hi> to whom Chriſt paid the <hi>price</hi> of our Redemption, and gave his Active and Paſſive Righteouſneſs for us: But <hi>Morally</hi> and <hi>Reputatively</hi> it is no unmeet phraſe to ſay that is <hi>given to us</hi> which is <hi>given for us</hi> in our neceſſity and to purchaſe us all this.</p>
                  <p>If the King would ranſom all his Subjects that are Slaves to the <hi>Turks,</hi> and paid a million for their Freedom, he may well be ſaid to give them a million, though it be but a <hi>Metonymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Speech,</hi> ſeeing he gave it for them: Though it was the Freedom or Benefits and not the Money which indeed they received: And ſo it is here: So God giveth us Chriſts Righteouſneſs, Merits and Satisfaction; but not properly the things themſelves. If there be any more to be ſaid as given us, I ſhould have been glad to know what it is: but your Words ſhew it not.</p>
                  <p>Were it the very ſame Individual Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that Chriſt hath, Acts, Habits and Formal Relation made in themſelves our own accidents, it would follow that we are really perfect in Acts, Habits and Relation, and need neither more Pardon nor increaſe of Grace, nor ſhould pray for any, nor uſe means for any, nor are we li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:66508:66"/>
to any corrective Penalty, nor to any want of the Spirits help, but have preſent right to all that is due to a perfect righteous man; with much more ſuch, which is all falſe.</p>
                  <p>Yet is it truly and fitly ſaid that <hi>Chriſt is our Righteouſneſs,</hi> that is, the purchaſer and giver of it; and that he is <hi>made of God to us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption,</hi> on the ſame account: Yea though ſome deny it, his Righteouſneſs may <hi>be called the material cauſe</hi> of our <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> as ours is our <hi>Jus ad impunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem &amp; vitam,</hi> becauſe it is the <hi>matter</hi> of it's <hi>meritorious cauſe.</hi> For if <hi>Adam</hi> had merited Life himſelf, his meritorious Acts and Habits would have been fitly called, the <hi>matter of his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> that is, of the <hi>fundamentum Relationis.</hi> Yet this is the difference: <hi>Adams Right</hi> or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Juſt,</hi> would have reſulted immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from his own Acts and Habits c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:66508:72"/>I ſtill grant that Chriſt ſuffered, yea and obeyed, in ſome ſort, in our ſtead, though not in our perſon, Civil, or Legal, ſo as that we are Legally reputed the doers of it by or in him: And that his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming our Nature, and being the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> a voluntary Sponſor and Mediator, was a neceſſary reaſon of the application of the fruits to us; and that we are as certainly and happily juſtified and glorified, as if we had been the doers and ſatisfiers our ſelves (ſo many as are ſaved;) But not on the ſame reaſons, nor in the ſame method or manner of conveyance: Nor when in judgment we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed as having ſinned and deſerved death, can we deny it, &amp; plead that we were innocent by another, or by imputation, as we ſhould have been, had we been innocent our ſelves: But we muſt plead par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and a free gift of life, through the merits, ſatisfaction and interceſſion of a Saviour.</p>
                  <p>§ 21. And to all before ſaid, I may add, That they who account all the <hi>Laws obligations</hi> on each perſon to be <hi>fulfilled</hi> by Chriſt, (and not only ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction given for our not fulfilling them, 1. Muſt ſuppoſe that <hi>one perſon</hi> of Chriſt to have been Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally <hi>as many perſons</hi> as he died for (or juſtifieth:) For the <hi>Law</hi> laid as many <hi>diſtinct obligations on them,</hi> as they were <hi>perſons,</hi> and laid them <hi>only on their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi> It ſaid, <hi>Thou</hi> Adam, <hi>Thou</hi> Eve, <hi>ſhalt perſonally obey perfectly, or die</hi>: And the Law of Nature, and of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid in ſenſe, Thou <hi>Solomon,</hi> Thou <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> (and ſo of all others) ſhalt do all things commanded, and not ſin. Now that in all Chriſts Obedience he was Legally and imputatively ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeveral perſons, <hi>Adam, Eve, Solomon, Manaſſeh,</hi> and ſo that none of theſe broke Gods Law, I find
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:66508:72"/>
not in the Scripture. If you ſay, <hi>Adam was Legally as many perſons</hi> as are born of him in ſin, I deny it: He was the Root of all his Poſterity, and they were in him ſeminally and virtually, but not <hi>perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, actually,</hi> or imputatively: But by one mans diſobedience, as their Root and Cauſe, many are made ſinners: And by one mans obedience, as the Root and Cauſe, all Believers are made righteous. It is enough that one Saviour and Mediator in a third perſon of his own <hi>did</hi> and <hi>ſuffered</hi> that which by its <hi>merits</hi> and <hi>value</hi> (as attaining the Ends of the Law and Government) procured our deliverance from a neceſſity of perfect obeying as the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Life, and from guilt and miſery, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Root, Head and Donor of Grace and Glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And if (as you ſay) it be the very <hi>thing</hi> that is imputed to us as ours, to all <hi>intents,</hi> as if we had done it, why have you not told us, whether it be <hi>all that Chriſt did,</hi> or but <hi>ſome?</hi> and <hi>what?</hi> and <hi>how</hi> from Scripture you prove the diſtribution? and whether we have not thus, a Righteouſneſs, which is both <hi>too much,</hi> and <hi>too little.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>Too much:</hi> For <hi>we</hi> were not obliged by the Law to be <hi>born of a Virgin,</hi> by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to <hi>faſt forty days,</hi> to turn <hi>Water into Wine,</hi> to <hi>caſt out Devils,</hi> to <hi>heal all diſeaſes,</hi> and <hi>raiſe the dead,</hi> to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aite the Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>ſend out Apoſtles. &amp;c.</hi> If you ſay that ſo much only of Chriſts Obedience is in <hi>it ſelf our own,</hi> as we muſt elſe have done our ſelves, I ask the proof of the limitation.</p>
                  <p>And II. Is it not then <hi>too little,</hi> if it muſt be the <hi>Idem,</hi> and not the <hi>Aequivalens?</hi> For ſome of us are bound to the Offices of <hi>Parents,</hi> and ſome of <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands</hi> and <hi>Wives,</hi> ſome of <hi>Servants,</hi> ſome of <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,</hi>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:66508:73"/>
ſome of <hi>Souldiers,</hi> ſome to actions proper to the <hi>ſick,</hi> to the <hi>old,</hi> and other conditions which Chriſt was never in: We are bound to <hi>mortifie our ſinful luſts,</hi> to <hi>pray for pardon and grace,</hi> to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a pardon offered,</hi> to <hi>yield to the mortifying mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> which Chriſt was not capable of. It was enough that he undertook all that was fit for him, and neceſſary by equivalency to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and merit a free gift of grace and glory for us, and that he performed the undertaken conditions and duties of all that Law which was laid on him; without doing all the ſame things which were laid on us.</p>
                  <p>§. 22. And one thing more I deſire you to note, which <hi>Grotius de ſatisf.</hi> hath minded us of, <hi>viz.</hi> The great difference that there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the caſe of a <hi>Rector</hi> and a <hi>Creditor,</hi> and between a <hi>Subject</hi> and a <hi>Debtor,</hi> or a Debt of <hi>Obedience</hi> or <hi>Puniſhment</hi> and a Debt of <hi>Money</hi>: For the name of <hi>Debt</hi> occaſioneth ſome men to run the ſimilitude of a <hi>Creditor</hi> and <hi>Debtor</hi> beyond the bounds. The Law requireth not a <hi>Debitor pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniae,</hi> 1. To pay the very <hi>ſame individual money</hi> which he borrowed, but the <hi>ſame ſum.</hi> 2. Nor to pay it by his <hi>own hands.</hi> But the Law of God ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth every Subject to every individual act which it commandeth. 2. And obligeth every man to do it all in his <hi>own perſon</hi> and not disjunctively by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or a Vicar. That Chriſt is <hi>limitedly</hi> and <hi>only to certain ends and uſes</hi> a <hi>Vicarius poenae</hi> in the perſon of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> is not becauſe the <hi>Law</hi> as made to <hi>Adam</hi> required or accepted it, but the <hi>Lawgiver</hi> as <hi>above his Law.</hi> The Law that <hi>bound Chriſt</hi> is <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled</hi>; but the Law that <hi>bound Adam</hi> and every
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:66508:73"/>
man is <hi>not fulfilled</hi> unleſs that ſame man do himſelf all the ſame things which it commanded him.</p>
                  <p>§ 23. I conclude all with theſe profeſſions of my opinion of all theſe Controverſies.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. I believe that the Libertines (commonly called Antinomians) whoſe Doctrines I have in many Books oppoſed, do uſe thoſe ill Notions, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods which on pretence of magnifying Chriſt and free grace, do by plain conſequence wrong Chriſt and Grace, and <hi>Subvert the Goſpel,</hi> and ſhould rather be <hi>thence</hi> denominated, than from their <hi>denying the Law.</hi> (The Law of <hi>Innocency</hi> as a <hi>Covenant,</hi> and of <hi>Moſes</hi> as Jewiſh being truly ceaſed.)</p>
                  <p n="2">II. I believe that yet moſt of thoſe that thus err in notions, are not ſo bad in their <hi>Judgment</hi> of the <hi>matter it ſelf</hi> as their <hi>words import</hi>; but that want of <hi>Skill in Terms</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> hath ſeduced men of dull wits, ſlight popular ſtudies, and undigeſted thoughts, to ſpeak worſe than they think, and had they more exact diſtinguiſhing and expreſſive Skill, they would ſhew that they mean moſtly as others do.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. I believe that unskilful contending with the Papiſts hath occaſioned all this, while in the heats of Controverſy men bend all their wits to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the Doctrine of their adverſaries, not fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enough unſafe expreſſions and contrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams while they ſeem to ſerve their preſent turn: And then departing from Scripture terms as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſet their hearers far enough from their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, are next carried into a multitude of new made articles or notions, contrary alſo to Scripture <hi>ſenſe,</hi> when they have once thus left the words.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. I believe that moſt honeſt, plain, leſs learned Chriſtians, and the throughly ſtudied and learned
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:66508:74"/>
Teachers, agree in the true ſence of the Doctrine of Juſtification which the <hi>half ſtudied</hi> contenders make to ſeem more difficult than it is, and muddy it by their unlearned queſtions and words. That is, all plain Chriſtians hold, that [<hi>Chriſt God and Man is our only Saviour who obeyed, ſuffered and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceedeth for us, as a Mediator, and is become as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer the Lord of all, even of Nature, Grace and Glory, and hath merited, purchaſed and made a Covenant and Law of Grace, that whoever believeth in him ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life; offering his Grace to all, and effectually giving it to ſome</hi>; And that as our King and Lord <hi>Redeemer he governeth us by this Law, and requireth Faith and Repentance of all that will be pardoned, and ſincere obedience to the end, of all that will be glorified; and as he pardoneth all paſt ſin at our Converſion, ſo to thoſe that believe and ſincerely obey him, he pardoneth all their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſins; and as he maketh them righteous by giving them his Spirit to perform the conditions of pardon, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption and Salvation, and by forgiving all their ſins, and freely giving them right to life Eternal, for the ſake of his Sacrifice and Merits, ſo he accordingly virtually juſtifieth them by his Covenant, and ſo eſteemeth them, and will ſo uſe them, and will ſo judge them finally by his Sentence hereafter, and will receive them as ſo juſtified and adopted to his Glory.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>This all agree in till wranglers trouble them; and this much is enough.</p>

                  <p>SInce the Writing of all that followeth, I have ſeen the New Edition of Dr. <hi>Criſp's</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: There are prefixed to it, twelve Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Names, Mr. <hi>Griffiths,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cockains,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chancys,</hi> Mr. <hi>Howes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Alſops,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nat.

Criſpes</hi> invective againſt me, unnamed, with the Citation of ſome Preachers Words as contrary to mine.</p>
                  <p>I muſt deſire thoſe <hi>Conformiſts</hi> that will write the next friendly debate, and will charge Hereſy on the <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> that they will lay the charge on none, but the guilty; and that they take not all whoſe Names are prefixed to be of the judgment of Dr. <hi>Criſpe</hi> (a Conformist): For I am paſt doubt, that Four or Five of them are againſt it. If you ask, why then did they give their Names to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged up like a Sign before the Door of a Houſe of Seduction, it's like they have ſomething more to ſay
<pb facs="tcp:66508:76"/>
for it than I know of: But their Words ſhew you that they only teſtifie the Sermons to be the Drs. own. They are men of Peace, and inclined to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie others in atteſting a truth, and I ſuppoſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not to promote untruth by it.</p>

                  <p>It offendeth me that I muſt but briefly name their errours, inſtead of a large confutation of them, while the whole Scripture is againſt them; but I have done it oft largely, which they will not anſwer.

                  <p>To be one in Spirit, is no more to be one <hi>Perſon,</hi> than ſeeing by the ſame Sun-light maketh all Lyes to be one Eye. For the Spirit is not our perſonality.</p>
                  <p>And if you make Chriſt to be many Millions of Perſons, where is his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in himſelf, or with any.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> If Chriſt and the Elect, be all one, and the ſame Perſon, then the Elect are really God himſelf: For the Perſon of Chriſt, is God: Theſe men are unfit to confute the Schools who have long maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the very human nature of Chriſt, is not a part of his Perſon, but an accident of it; becauſe he is but one Perſon, which is the ſecond in Trinity from Eternity, and is God (of which ſee <hi>Derodon de Suppoſito.</hi>) And if we are all one God, then God ſuffers when we ſuffer, and God judgeth himſelf when he judgeth us: May not Men pray to ſuch then, and Worſhip them as Gods, and Truſt in them
<pb facs="tcp:66508:77"/>
as Gods? Is not this Idolatry worſe than Image-Worſhip, or than Anti-chriſtianity?</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> If Chriſt and the Elect be one and the ſame Perſon, then Chriſt ſinneth when ever they ſin: And Chriſt ſuffered for his own ſin, even that which he by them committed: And then he pardoneth his own ſin; (or who pardoneth him)? But all this is falſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4.</hi> And it would follow, that all the Elect are Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators to themſelves, and dyed for their own ſins, and pardon their own ſins, and juſtify themſelves, and believe in themſelves, and ſave themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <hi>5.</hi> And are all Chriſt's threatnings againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which are againſt us? Doth Satan overcome him, when ever he overcometh us? Is his Law made for himſelf, that is made for us? Doth he command a Father to correct Chriſt, when he commandeth him to correct his Children? Doth the Magiſtrate hang Chriſt when he hangeth a Malefactor, tho' Elect, (that ſinneth by ſurprize.)</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>6.</hi> Where there are divers Bodies, and divers Souls, and divers <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings, and divers Wills, there are divers Perſons: But of all theſe, in Chriſt and us there is a diverſity.</p>
                  <p>I believe that the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion between Chriſt and the Glorified, will be neerer than we can well now conceive: But not ſuch as will make us one and the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with Chriſt. I have read in Phanatick Fryers, ſuch as <hi>Barbanſon,</hi> and <hi>Benedictus de Benedictis,</hi> and in <hi>Gibienf</hi> the <hi>Oratorian,</hi> of our Deification, and being Goded with God, and that it is the only perfection to know no being but God: And I have read of ſuch Heathen as Worſhipped Demon-Gods, that once were men. And it is the top of the now prevalent Bruitiſm, or Sadduciſm, to believe that all Souls are but one God, and as Candles that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuate by the Oily Matter, when extinct, are all
<pb facs="tcp:66508:77"/>
one in the common Air; and that there is nothing but God and Matter. But I hope few good Chriſtians will ſo far loſe the knowledge of themſelves, as to take themſelves to be the ſame Perſon with him that is God: Angels forbad <hi>John</hi> to Worſhip them, tho' he took them not for God. Do thoſe Churches ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Diſcipline upon ſuch as are one Perſon with Chriſt? Do they Excommunicate Chriſt for ſin? No wonder that Dr. <hi>Criſpe</hi> chargeth <hi>David</hi> as ſpeaking untruth, for complaining of his ſin, and Gods diſpleaſure; tho' <hi>John</hi> ſays, He is a Lyar that ſaith he hath no ſin, and all God's Saints have profeſs'd Repentance; but I read not that Chriſt did ever Repent of ſin.</p>
                  <p>I doubt ſome will think that I feign Mr. <hi>Criſpe</hi> to ſay what he doth not, his words are theſe:</p>

And if this be no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Righteouſneſs, what doth the word ſignify ſo many hundred times uſed in the Scripture?</p>
                  <p>Let them but grant Juſtification by Faith, and let them aſſign Faith what Office therein they can reaſonably imagine, without flat denying all <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, and they will confute Dr. <hi>Criſpe.</hi> Say but that Faith is imputed to us for Righteouſneſs, and give not the lye to <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſure we ſhall be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.

And yet, if they will expound Imputation ſoberly, we ſhall grant them the matter (that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is accounted to us

of God, as the only Meritorious Cauſe of our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and Salvation) tho' we believe that by <hi>Faith, Paul</hi> meaneth <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if they ſtill ſay, that by <hi>Faith is meant only the Object of Faith, and not the Act;</hi> could we but get them to forbear Anathematizing Men for being ſo Learned, as to underſtand Engliſh, we might yet hope at leaſt, to keep the flame of their Zeal out of the thatch within the Chimney; by telling them the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the <hi>Object of Faith,</hi> as <hi>ſuch,</hi> and the perſon that is the Object, otherwiſe conſidered. In <hi>real Exiſtence,</hi> Chriſt, tho' not yet believed in, is the ſole meritorious Cauſe: But it is only in <hi>eſſe cognito,</hi> that Chriſt is the Object of Faith. And School-Boyes that have no damnable Learning, may teach theſe confident men, that the <hi>Object</hi> as an <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject believed,</hi> is the very form in <hi>ſpecie</hi> of the Act of Faith: It is an Act without it, but not <hi>this Act,</hi> viz. the Chriſtian Faith.

But if they will grant that by <hi>Faith</hi> is meant <hi>Faith,</hi> and not ſay that <hi>Paul</hi> condemneth Juſtification by Faith, as being but Juſtification by Works; let them but tell us, how it juſtifieth: I ſay not efficiently at all; but only as a meer receptive qualification: If they ſay as an <hi>Efficient Inſtrument,</hi> they give it much more than I do; and lay it on the Act or the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>I thought it meet to have recited many hundred Texts of Scripture, which they directly contradict, which good Men ſhould rather believe than them: But if the Reader will peruſe my <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> he will find it there done already.</p>

                  <p>I ſtill ſay, I will not loſe my Charity as to the Perſons of theſe blind Zealots, and unskilful Talkers: But how conſcionably ſoever they live, it is no thanks to their ungodly unchriſtian Doctrine.

It is no wonder that ſuch men would caſt out Reaſon from Religion; for their Religion ſeemeth to be by meer inſtinct: But if it muſt be without Reaſon, it is hard that they will make it all againſt Reaſon. While Reaſon is eſſential to man, no wonder then if Religion meet with much Reſistance; and if, as one of Mr. <hi>Criſpe's</hi> Authors ſaith, <hi>(nigro Carbone notandus) That to cauſe one to believe in</hi> Chriſt, <hi>be as great a Miracle as</hi> Chriſt<hi>'s Reſurrection, and as great an Inſtance of Almightineſs, as any Work that God hath made:</hi> No doubt, but it is a hard, and great, and ſpecial Work, and an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Omnipotency, or elſe it were no effect of God: For, <hi>omnis potentia eſt Dei eſt Omnipotentia.</hi> A Hand or tongue moveth not but by Omnipotency; but all that God doth, are not equal Inſtances or Demonſtrations of Omnipotency; nor are they all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and as great Miracles as the Reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Is not the Preaching of the Goſpel a means of mens believing? And is that as great a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle as <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Reſurrection, that is wrought by ſo rational a means, uſed by man? I am ſure St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſed not ſo much to prove the Truth of Chriſtianity from this Medium, [<hi>ſome believed it;</hi> ergo, <hi>it is true</hi>] as by the Reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt</hi>: Nor is every Woman or Mans Belief as good a Proof that the Goſpel is true: I would not have Infidels taught to ſay, <hi>If God damn me for not believing, it will be for not doing that which is as great a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<pb facs="tcp:66508:83"/>
as</hi> Chriſt<hi>'s Reſurrection, and as great an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Almighty Power, as the making of Sun and Moon, and of the World:</hi> Overdoing is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing.</p>
                  <p>But if the men that I oppoſe, be religious, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny but it muſt be by Miracle or Madneſs: Conſider and judge.</p>
                  <p>Is it any other to be for Religion, and to preach and labour, and ſuffer for it, if it have no Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it, and will do no good, and muſt thus be believed? That is good that doth good. Dr. <hi>Criſpe</hi> is large and earneſt in telling us, that nothing that we do, muſt be done to do us any good, or give us the leaſt Gain or Advantage, nor must ſuch a Thought come into our hearts, that we ſhall be ever the better for it; for <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath already done all that we need. And if it do us no good, it doth good to none. To God it can do none; if we be righteous, what do we give him. Our goodneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth not to him, by adding any thing to him. <hi>Pſal. 16.1, 2.</hi> And to men it can do no good, if it can do none to our ſelves; for either thoſe men be elect, or not: If they be elect, all their good was perfected by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as well as ours before they were born: And it will be as great an injury to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to endeavour to do them any good, as our ſelves: And this either to their Souls or Bodies; for <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath purchaſed all good for both: Oh what an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote againſt Charity is here, and againſt doing good to all men, eſpecially to them of the Houſhold of Faith, and againſt feeding <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Members!</p>
                  <p>But if they are not elect, theſe men ſay that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed not for them, to purchaſe them any good, and to do them good, is impoſſible; and what a Wrong would it be to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for us to pretend to do men good with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, or his purchaſe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:66508:83"/>But they ſay, we muſt do it in Thankfulneſs, for being ſaved already: But what good is in that Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, when it doth no good to God or man, to our ſelves or others? Is not this to truſt to works? All Acts with them are <hi>Works,</hi> and Thankfulneſs is an Act or Habit.</p>
                  <p>And if we are never the better for Love, Thanks, and Praiſes to God on earth, what the better ſhall we be for them in Heaven? What do theſe men preach for? What do they gather Churches for? And what do they exerciſe ſtrictneſs for, by thier ſelf deviſed terms of their Church-Communion? What do they write for and wrangle for, while they profeſs that it is not to do any good, to God, to themſelves, to the elect, or to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate (which undenyably followeth)? I know you ſpeak for Faith, Prayer, and Holineſs, and I think you pray your ſelves: But to what end, <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>ask and have, ſeek and find;</hi> Dr. <hi>Criſpe</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſeek not to find:</hi> O think not that you ſhall be ever the better for praying, or any thing elſe that you do in the greatest heigth of Piety. Is Prayer only a Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving? I knew an old Man (one <hi>Diſhforth,</hi> by <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verley</hi> near <hi>Bradford</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi>) who went among the Followers of <hi>Hacket</hi> and <hi>Coppinger,</hi> called, <hi>Grun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dletonians</hi> (from the Town where they lived): And going for Novelty among them, they breathed on him, and he came home ſo tranſported, that he left his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer way of Praying in his Family, with Confeſſion and Petition, and did all by Extaſy, and Thankſgiving, and Praiſe, and ſo continued about a Fortnight, and then returned to Humility, and repented (himſelf and his Son were my Informers.)</p>
                  <p>I wonder that it is not ſo with all that think praying, hearing, reading, meditating, and Sacraments do no good: And all from a ſottiſh Expoſition of <hi>[Do this and live,]</hi> as if forbid doing any thing that

<pb facs="tcp:66508:84"/>
If you do, I ſhall be glad that you are confined to your ſeduced ignorant Congregations. If you will tell the World, <hi>If you are elect, no ſin can poſſibly hurt you; whatever Murders, Adulteries, Perjuries you commit it is none of your ſin, but</hi> Chriſts: <hi>It cannot be his and yours too; and if not elect, you have no hope; and if you be elect, you will be never the better for praying, conſidering, charity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or any Act of Religion, or Juſtice, which you do, nor muſt once think to gain any thing by it:</hi> How many Converts is this like to make? And what would ſuch a Nation come to? I hope few of the publick Preachers that you call ſcandalous, preach ſo ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly as this. I have one Requeſt to you, that if you, or any other be questioned by the judges for Murder, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, Falſe-witneſs, Perjury, or Robbery, you will not ſay as Dr. <hi>Criſpe</hi> hath taught you [I am no Murderer, Adulterer, perjured Robber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is <hi>Chriſt</hi> that is ſuch a one, and not I; it cannot be my ſin, when he hath made it his]; for I doubt, neither the Judges or Jury well believe you: If you believe not we, ask the Judges, whether it be you or <hi>Chriſt</hi> that is the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? I doubt it is you that will be hang'd.</p>
                  <p>If you ſay, [for what may not ignorance ſay] <hi>That it is not at the Bar of man, but of God only, that</hi> Chriſt <hi>is the ſinner, and not we:</hi> I Anſwer, Know you not that Judges and Princes are God's Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and that the Judgment is the Lords; and that what they do according to his Will, he doth by them: He doth not command Rulers to hang men for a ſin that is none of theirs. All mens Judgments are Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, that are againſt the fore-known Judgment of God. It is the King that puniſheth when the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man executeth: God puniſheth men by Rulers, and doth it righteouſly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:66508:85"/>I write all this, the rather becauſe Mr. <hi>Cokain,</hi> in his Preface, exhorteth Preachers to go on where the Dr. left: I humbly beſeech them firſt to read and believe, <hi>Mat. 5. &amp; 6.</hi> and <hi>7, 8.</hi> and <hi>13.18.25.</hi> and all the Sermons and Parables of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and not down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right to give him the Lie, and call it <hi>exalting him:</hi> And for them that report that there are no ſuch Words in Dr. <hi>Criſpe,</hi> as <hi>I</hi> report, <hi>I</hi> wonder not while they think that lying can do them no hurt, and is not their ſin, but <hi>Chriſts.</hi>

All Chriſtians believe that our ſins were laid upon Chriſt as to their penalty, that he was <hi>Vicarius poenae,</hi> that he ſuffered for us, the juſt for the unjuſt, to reconcile us to God, and that he was made for us, a Sacrifice for ſin, that we might be healed by his ſtripes, and waſhed in his Blood.</p>
                        <p>But what Chriſtian can believe Dr. <hi>Criſpe</hi> and his Sectaries, that Chriſt took not only the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and guilt <hi>(reatum poenae)</hi> but all the very ſins themſelves of all the Elect, habitual and actual, privative and poſitive, of omiſſion and commiſſion, and ſo really became the moſt wicked man in all the World; and that lie ſaveth us from ſin, by becoming a thouſand times worſe himſelf, than any of us; when it cannot be proved that any one Devil had ſo great a hand in mans ſin, as to make all our ſins his own? And Dr. <hi>Criſpe</hi> well vindicateth God from falſe Imputation of that ſin
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66508:87"/>
to Chriſt, which was not his: But it is by Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, making that his, which was never his, even the very ſins of all the Elect. 3. And do you think any Soul that hath the Spirit of God, and readeth and believeth the Scriptures can believe this Dr. <hi>that no ſin can poſſibly hurt the Elect,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are fully ſaved already by Chriſt? And that it is againſt Chriſt and his Grace, to intend our Salvation, or any good to our ſelves by any Duty we do, or to look to be ever the better for praying, obeying, believing, but muſt do all only in thankfulneſs, and for the good of others.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Do you think that a man (not to ſay a Chriſtian) can believe that the torments of the <hi>Stone, Gout, Collick, Convulſion, &amp;c.</hi> are no hurt, or no caſtigatory Penalty? And that it is no hurt or puniſhment for an Elect Perſon to be under decays of Holineſs, increaſe of Sin, prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Temptations, the terrours of God, and loſs of his Conſolations, and fears of Death: He that can believe all this, may believe <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> againſt all the ſenſes of mankind. A Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of ſuch Inſtances may be named, which have ſo ugly a countenance, that men that loved their Souls, will be affrighted from <hi>Antinomianiſm,</hi> by the reading of them. And I further tell you, that too ſudden and eager diſputing againſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, doth but engage men to ſtretch their wits to find out what to ſay to defend it, and to take thoſe for Enemys to God and them, who ſhame their folly.</p>
                        <p>And I muſt confeſs, that tho' I am much for Miniſters aſſociations and conſultations in order to Concord and mutual Edification; I am not much for the way of deciding doctrinal Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies

by majority of Votes, remembring what Councils have done that way theſe 1300 Years, and how often either errour or unskilful deciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions have the greater number; ſo that tho' now with us, they will conſent againſt errours; it may be taken for a precedent for erroneous plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, to Tyrannize or tread down truth hereafter.</p>

                        <p>BEfore I give you a Confutation of the Errours of the <hi>Anti-Goſpellers,</hi> I will promiſe theſe two things:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. I will here give you a Catalogue of their Errours which I am Confute. 2. I think it needful to caution you, what to think of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that you Cenſure them not too hardly, tho' the Errours as worded, be very great.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. And 1. As the general Fault of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, is the confounding of things which greatly differ; ſo by this, they corrupt the Doctrine of <hi>Adams</hi> Communication of ſin and guilt to his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, and thereby raiſe more dangerous Errours,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66508:88"/>
They feign, that God made a Covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> (and all his Poſterity ſay ſome, as in him) that if he ſtood, God would continue him and his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity; and if he fell, God would take it as if all his Poſterity then perſonally, ſinned in him; and ſo, that either we were all then perſonally in him, or God by Imputation would take us to have ſo been: And ſo that God's Covenant and Imputation, made <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, ours, further than it is by natural propagation; not truly diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between our being <hi>Perſonally</hi> in him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but <hi>Virtually,</hi> and <hi>Seminally</hi> in him: And feigning God to make <hi>Adam</hi> not only the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Father and Root of Mankind, but alſo Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, a Conſtituted Repreſenter of all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that ſhould ſpring from him; and ſo that God made them ſinners, that were none, and that, before he made them men.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Whence they infer, that Chriſt was by Gods impoſition and his own ſponſion, made the Legal Repreſentative Perſon of every one of the Elect taken ſingularly; ſo that what he did for them, God reputeth them to have done by him.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Hereby they falſly make the Perſon of the Mediator, to be the legal Perſon of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and deny the true Mediatorſhip.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. But they cannot agree, when this Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating of the Elect began: Some ſay, It had no beginning, but was from Eternity; becauſe Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was from Eternity, and we were Elected in Chriſt; and ſo were Perſons from Eternity in him.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. Others ſay, That it began at the making of the World, Chriſt being then the firſt of Gods Works in a Super-angelical Nature, emaning from the Divine, which contained all our Perſons in it; as the Beams are of, or in the Sun.</p>
                        <p n="6">
                           <pb n="8" facs="tcp:66508:89"/>VI. Others ſay, that this Perſonation began at the giving to <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt Law or Covenant of <hi>Innocency,</hi> and that Chriſt was a perſon in the Bond or Covenant: And that the meaning of it was, <hi>Thou or Chriſt perſonating thee, ſhall perfectly Obey; or Thou or He ſhall Die the threatned death for Sin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Others ſay, that this Perſonation began at the making of the Promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. of the <hi>Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="8">VIII. Others ſay, that it began at Chriſts <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> when he took the Nature of Man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with all our Perſons.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. Others ſay, that it began on his Croſs, or at leaſt, at his Humiliation, and that he only ſuffered in our perſons.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. Others ſay, that it begins at our Believing and our Union with Chriſt by Faith; and then he by Union perſonateth us.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. They deny Gods Covenant or Law of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,</hi> that required our Perſonal Obedience, as the condition of Life.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. They forge a Law that God never made, that ſaith, <hi>Thou, or thy Surety, ſhall Obey Perfectly, or Dye.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. They falſly ſay, that God juſtifyeth none that are not really or imputatively perfectly <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, Obedient,</hi> and ſuch as never <hi>Sinned,</hi> but kept all that Law.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. They confound Gods Covenant with Chriſt as Mediator, impoſing on him his Mediatorial part, and the Covenant of the Father and Son, with faln Man, impoſing on them the terms of Recovery and Life.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. They hold that the firſt Law (and ſome of them alſo <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law) is done away as to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66508:89"/>
all the Elect, but is ſtill in force to all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, and was in force to Chriſt: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bound him to Obedience as our Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative antecedently to mans fall, or only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, they are in their confuſion at a loſs. And they hold that its curſe and penalty ſentenced af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fall by God, fell on all the Reprobate and on Chriſt, but none of it on any of the Elect, as having been ſuffered by Chriſt fully for them.</p>
                        <p>As I have ſaid, The promiſſary part of that Law ceaſed, and ſo did the condition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, by mans ſin making it impoſſible; but the threat did <hi>tranſire in ſententiam:</hi> And if Chriſt was antecedently in the bond of Obedience for us, he was bound not to Eat of the forbidden Tree, and bound to dreſs the Garden, and bound to take <hi>Eve</hi> for his Wife, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are all falſe.</p>
                        <p>If he were bound by it as our repreſentative after the fall, it bound him when it ceaſed, and bound not us, which is falſe: And therefore it was only the Law of perfect Innocency anew im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on himſelf, by the Mediatorial Covenant that bound him.</p>
                        <p>And if the Penal Sentence and Curſe, be Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted on all the Reprobate, then it is not ceaſed: And then it muſt be a Penalty, and that Curſe, even on the Elect before they believe, becauſe till then, they have no part in Chriſt. And after they believe, they muſt bear part of that Penalty, called a Curſe, which was fixed, and not reverſed and pardoned; that is, The privation of thoſe degrees of Grace, Peace, and Joy, which they ſhould have had if there had been no ſin: The Curſe on the Earth, Sorrow in Child-bearing, and Death: Theſe ceaſe not now to be Penals, but are Sanctified Penalties. A Curſe turned to a Bleſſing; an Evil made a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66508:90"/>
Medicine to our good; Correction is truly Penal, tho' profitable; Chriſt ſuffered to attain his own Ends, and not to croſs them, His Ends was not to free the Elect from his own Government, or Correcting Juſtice.</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. They affirm, that the Covenant is made only with Chriſt, for us, but not with us: As it God made none with man, and Baptizing and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity were not Covenanting.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII. They feign God to have made an eternal Covenant with his Son; that is, God impoſing on God, the Law of Mediation.</p>
                        <p n="18">XVIII. They moſt dangerouſly affirm, that Chriſt took not only the puniſhment of our ſin, and that guilt, or <hi>Reatum poenae,</hi> which is an aſſumed obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſuffer the puniſhment deſerved by us, (to be <hi>Vicarius poenae</hi>) but <hi>all our very Sins themſelves:</hi> the very <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the <hi>Sin of all the Elect</hi>; the <hi>Reatum Culpae:</hi> So that, tho' he never did ſin himſelf, yet all our ſins, habitual and actual, poſitive and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative, of commiſſion and omiſſion, became truly and properly Chriſts own ſins: And ſo, that he was truly judged a hater and blaſphemer of God and Holineſs, and the greateſt murderer, adulterer, thief, lyar, perjured Traytor in all the World, the ſins of all the Elect being truly His ſins. Of which Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> is poſitive and large.</p>
                        <p n="19">XVIIII. They ſay, that God laid theſe ſins of ours on him, and made him properly ſin for us, and not only a Sacrifice for ſin: And ſo, that God is the Maker of the greateſt Sin.</p>
                        <p n="19">XIX. They ſay, that Gods Imputation being truly but the accounting one to be what he is; had not God made him a Sinner, his imputing or reckoning him ſuch, had been a Lye; which is true, tho' they nifer Falſhood from it, taking Imputation of Sin, ſtrictly for a true Eſtimation.</p>

They that make this Imputation to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Incarnation, make God to make himſelf this great Sinner; that is, Chriſt while he was meer God: And ſo make us a wicked God. When Satan can but Tempt us to ſin, and its not proved that any one Devil is guilty of all mens ſins, they make God guilty of all; yea, they that lay it on Chriſt only after his Incarnation, lay it on him that is God.</p>
                        <p n="21">XXI. They that feign Chriſt to have perſonated us in his firſt Covenant of Redemption, make us by him, to have Covenanted to Redeem our ſelves, and to do the Mediator-work.</p>
                        <p n="22">XXII. They feign Chriſt to have made ſuch an Exchange with the Elect, as that having taken all their Sins, he hath given them all his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; not only the <hi>Fruit of it,</hi> but the <hi>Thing in it ſelf:</hi> So that they are as perfectly Righteous as Chriſt himſelf, and ſo eſteemed of God.</p>
                        <p>But here they differ; 1. Some ſay we have only all his <hi>Paſſive Righteouſneſs:</hi> Some ſay alſo all his <hi>Active:</hi> 3. Others alſo all his <hi>Habitual:</hi> 4. Others, all his <hi>Eſſential Divine Righteouſneſs</hi>; and ſo are Goded.</p>
                        <p n="23">XXIII. This perfect Righteouſneſs, they ſay we have at leaſt from the time of Chriſt's death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were born, or had any perſonal Beeing.</p>

                        <p n="15">XXV. Hence they ſay, that the elect have no ſin, becauſe it is all Chriſt's, and cannot be his and theirs alſo.</p>
                        <p n="16">XXVI. They ſay that Chriſt having perfectly

                        <p n="27">XXVII. They ſay all ſin paſt, preſent, and to come, are pardoned, even that not committed (that is no ſin.)</p>

                        <p n="35">XXXV. They hold, that Chriſt was no Law-Maker, and ſo muſt infer, that he was no King, and had no Laws of his own, to Govern or Judge by; and ſo deny a chief Part of his Office, and his Kingdom, and Government, who is King of Kings.</p>
                        <p n="36">XXXVI. They ſay, If God ſhould puniſh any ſin of the elect, it would be injuſtice; becauſe it is all puniſhed already on Chriſt, and the Debt is fully paid by him.</p>
                        <p n="37">XXXVII. They take God's Covenants and Laws to be things ſo different, as that a Law is not his Covenant, nor his Covenant a Law: Whereas, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p n="42">XLII.

And if no Judgment, then no Judge, no Reward, no Condemnation, and no Puniſhment: If any Judgment, there muſt be Perſons, and a Cauſe to be tryed and judged. 1.

It is not for <hi>Chriſt</hi> to judge himſelf: It is not to judge God, whether he elected us? It is not to judge, whether we were of the Seed of <hi>Adam,</hi> or whether we ever ſinned? Or whether the Law of Innocency condemn us; And our ſin deſerve ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Puniſhment?

But the Cauſe will be, 1. Whether we are lyable, by Guilt, to future Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment? And againſt this, our Pardon juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us. 2. And, whether we have Right to the Heavenly Inheritance? And in this, the Goſpel-Donation, Covenant, or Promiſe, juſtifieth us; and both thro' the Merits of the Sacrifice, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 3. And the other part of the Cauſe of that day, is, whether we have part in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Merits of his Righteouſneſs? In which our Faith, and God's Covenant will ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie us. 4. And the Queſtion, being, Whether this Faith be that which had the promiſe, and not a Counterfeit; the deſcription of it, by its Acts and Part, and not only by adventitious Signs, muſt be our juſtifying Evidence: The faith that

                        <p>And as to the Caſe of Accuſation; 1. A Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Accuſation by the Law, which we have broken, and condemneth us, requireth a Juſtification, if there were no more. 2. The Glory of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Merits, Righteouſneſs and Grace, requireth a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of us, againſt our real Guilt. 3.

                        <p>It is certain, that ſentential and apologetical Juſtification relates to Accuſation (virtual or actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al) and Condemnation. <hi>Who ſhall condemn us, it is God that juſtifieth us?</hi> And if we are not juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt falſe Accuſations, we ſhall never be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified againſt any.</p>

                     <p>And I am ſorry, that the ſame hand in another Lecture, elſewhere publiſheth, that
<q>[That any are brought to believe in Jeſus, is as great a Miracle, as the Reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead] <hi>p. 223. And after</hi> [There is not a greater Inſtance of the Power of God in the whole World, than this, in bringing over the heart of a ſinner to believe in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>]</q>

with it. No doubt but Faith is a great and difficult Work, and wrought by Almighty Power: For God hath no other Power, but Omnipotency: <hi>omnis Dei Potentia eſt Omnipotentia, quia Infinita.</hi> Gods Power is his Eſſence: But the <hi>Inſtances</hi> and <hi>Demonſtrations</hi> of it, are as various as the Effects.

                     <p>And if it be a Miracle, and as great a one as Chriſt's Reſurrection, How can any believer doubt at all? Why was Chriſt's Reſurrection Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by the Apoſtles, ſo much as the Proof of the Truth of Chriſtianity, and not the Faith of every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever?

                     <p>And yet no doubt, the Author ſaith truly, that <hi>Faith in Chriſt is ſo hard a Work,</hi> that he that <hi>never found it hard, hath none</hi> (or hath it but in the ſeed,
