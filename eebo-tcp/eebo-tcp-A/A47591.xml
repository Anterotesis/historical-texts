            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </q>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Doth Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> think that we deny that any our Children have right to the Covenant of Grace? God forbid; the Controverſy lies not there: for all our Children that are elected, are decretively in the Covenant of Grace, alſo ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually by the Death and Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, and alſo actually they are and ſhall be in it when they believe, or when they have Union with Chriſt; but that the Children of the Faithful as ſuch, or (as ſo conſidered) are in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, we do utterly deny.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the Covenant of Grace was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and his Natural Seed as ſuch, will it not follow that he owns Univerſal Salvation?</p>
            <p>Can any Periſh that are in the Covenant of Grace? Is not that an everlaſting Covenant, well <hi>ordered in all things and <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="3">3. Doth not the Covenant and Promiſe to <hi>Adam</hi> run only to Chriſt Jeſus, or referr to him, who is there meant by <hi>the Seed of the Woman?</hi> True, we will allow that it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth alſo all the Elect of God, in a large ſenſe; but pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily and directly to Chriſt perſonally conſidered. But can any think this Promiſe is limited to the Carnal Seed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers or runs ſo? My Brethren, There are two Seeds, the one is called, <hi>The Seed of the Woman,</hi> which we affirm, is only Chriſt and all the Elect in him; and to all theſe the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace doth appertain, and to no more, as to the Special Bleſſings and Privileges thereof. The other are called, <hi>The Seed of the Serpent,</hi> who are the Ungodly; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſome of them from the Loins of the Faithful, as well as from the Loins of the Wicked; for as ſome Unbelievers Seed are in the Election of Grace, ſo ſome of the Seed of Believers are none of the Elect.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But to proceed, ſaith he, if the Children of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, are out of the Covenant of Grace, they have no Hope, and are without God in the World.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We, and all our Children, by Nature were dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes, and Children of Wrath, as others; and ſo without Hope and without God in the World, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 13. before we Believed, this was our Condition, and are not our Children naturally in this ſtate?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:65865:3"/>
But, what tho? yet when God <hi>calls them, renews them,</hi> and <hi>tranſlates them,</hi> out of the <hi>Firſt-Adam,</hi> and grafts them into the <hi>Second-Adam,</hi> they have the ſame Hope, and the ſame God to be their God, as we have,</p>
            <p>Again, He ſaith, <q>Doubtleſs, the Firſt Covenant doth condemn them becauſe of Original Sin, and if without intereſt in the Covenant of Grace, the Wrath of God abideth on them; but God forbid that we ſhould think there's more Vertue in the <hi>Firſt-Adam</hi> to Condemnation, than there is in the <hi>Second Adam</hi> to Save.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The caſe is plain, the <hi>Firſt-Adam,</hi> and all his, as ſo conſidered, were loſt, being Children of Wrath and of Condemnation: And the <hi>Second-Adam,</hi> and all his, are, or ſhall be ſaved, being Children of the Promiſe, and of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation. But doth Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> think, that all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Faithful, as ſuch, are the Seed or Children of the <hi>Second-Adam?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay again, Are all our Children in the Election of Grace, or doth Election run only in that Line?</p>
            <p>
               <q>If the <hi>Firſt-Adam</hi> had ſtood, we and our Children would have ſtood: Doth Faith in the <hi>Second-Adam,</hi> make the Condition of our Children worſer than it ſhould be through the Obedience of the Firſt-<hi>Adam?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Muſt God ſave all the Children of the <hi>Firſt-Adam</hi> by the Obedience of the <hi>Second,</hi> becauſe, if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood none of his Children had fallen? What Doctrine is this? You out do all the <hi>Arminians</hi> I have yet met with, but O! the Riches of God's Sovereign Grace, to any of the loſt Seed of Rebellious Mankind.</p>
            <p>If this you intend not, yet is every Believer a like common or publick Head to his natural Off-ſpring, as <hi>Adam</hi> was to his? Chriſt only is the publick Head of his Seed; a Believer's Faith objectively juſtifies and ſaves himſelf only, not his Children. Could Reverend Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> find no better a Pen to defend his Cauſe of <hi>Pedo-Baptiſm?</hi> My Faith may be ſaid to unite me to Chriſt; but doth it alſo unite my Child to Chriſt? What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever good Children do receive from their believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, besure the Parent's Faith doth not render his Child a Believer, but however my Faith doth not make the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Child worſer than it was, and it may not make the Condition of my Child better; for all the good Counſel, Education, good Example and Prayers; ſome Children have from their Godly Parents, they make them not the
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:65865:4"/>
better, <hi>'Tis not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that ſheweth Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You intimate what Cauſe there is of bitter Sorrow in the Churches of God, that the Major part of their Children are out off from the Covenant of Salvation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Our Doctrine cuts off not one Child of any Believer that is in the Covenant of Salvation; if God hath elected the major part of the Children of the Faithfull, we ſay they ſhall be ſaved: 'Tis impoſſible for any to cut off one of God's Elect. But what is this to their Children, as ſuch, or to the poſitive Right any of our Infants have to Baptiſm? Do you cut off your Infants from the Covenant of Salvation, becauſe you will not give them the Blood of the Covenant (I mean the Lord's Supper)?</p>
            <p>Brethren, Both the Sacraments are Ordinances that are of meer poſitive Right, <hi>viz.</hi> depending (as to the Subjects and all Matters thereunto belonging) upon the Sovereign Will and Pleaſure of the Lord Jeſus, the great Law-giver; and as they that come to one Ordinance are to examine themſelves and to diſcern the Lord's Body: So all they that come to the other are to believe in Chriſt, and to repent from dead Works.</p>
            <p>You miſtake, 'tis not the Eternal Covenant of Grace that you ſay you ſtand up in the Gap to maintain, but you ſtrive to introduce, in Goſpel-Times, an external relative Covenant according to the Fleſh, like that Covenant of Peculiarity, which God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Natural Seed, as he was a publick Head and Father of the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or of the National, Political and Typical Church of the Jews: Nay, you would fain have all the Seed of Believers to be in that Covenant, that peculiarly and abſolutely did belong to the Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as ſuch, and none elſe. Now 'tis this thing which we deny; we ſay that there was a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſignified by <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Agar:</hi> And tho there was Grace and Mercy in both, yet the Covenant of Grace or Free Promiſe was not made <hi>to Seeds, as of many, i. e.</hi> not to all the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or Seed of Believers, as ſuch, but primarily it was made to Chriſt, and in him to all the Elect, who alone are in the Eternal Covenant of Grace: That the Election takes hold both of ſome of Believers Seed and ſome of the Seed of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers is evident; and tho God may comprehend in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Love more of our Seed than of the Seed of Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:65865:4"/>
yet I have proved in this Treatiſe and Reply to Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> that the Covenant of Grace and the Election of God runs nor to the Seed of the Faithful, as ſuch; and alſo that Believers Seed nor Unbelievers Seed, until they believe in Chriſt, ought to be baptized, nor taken into the Viſible Church; becauſe 'tis not the Covenant of Grace. conſidered as ſuch, that gives any Perſon a Right to Baptiſm, but the meer poſitive Command of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; whoſe expreſs Command and Commiſſion injoins none to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed but ſuch who are Believers, or ſuch who are diſcipled by preaching the Word, <hi>Mat. 28. 19, 20. Mark 16. 16. John 4. 1. Acts 2. 37. Acts 8. 12, 14. Acts 8. 37. Acts 10. 47. Acts 16. 30, 31. Acts 18. 8. Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> tells Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> who he ſays hath the Tongue of the Learned, that his deſire was that he would be a Diſputant for thoſe Weaklings who are not able to diſpute for themſelves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> He tells us one while that Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> deſired and importuned him to write his Treatiſe, and at another time he ſays his Will and Deſire was that Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> ſhould do it.</p>
            <p>As touching the Reverend Mr. <hi>Samuel Jones,</hi> I have had ſuch an account of him, by a Worthy Miniſter, that I am fully ſatisfied, that had he wrote on this Subject, we ſhould have had no ſuch bitter Reflections or ill Treatment as we meet withal from this Man: He hath dipped his Pen into Gall and Wormwood, and hath made work for Repentance; beſides, I am informed that Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> neither put him upon this Work nor approves of it, tho perhaps when he ſaw his Forwardneſs, he might ſay <hi>Go on and do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sirs, thoſe Weaklings he means need no ſuch a Diſputant, he hath done them no ſervice, nor the Church of God either; we throw none of them out of that Eternal Covenant of which he ſpeaks, nor can Men nor Angels do it; ſuch of our Infants that are in the Eternal Covenant are ſafe enough: But we deny that our Infants are in that Covenant of <hi>Peculiarity</hi> which God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his natural Seed, as ſuch. And this I doubt not but you will find in the inſuing Anſwer ſufficiently proved. Moreover,</p>
            <p>
               <q>(He ſays) He ſtands up in the gap to maintain the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Covenant which God made with the Faithful and their Seed.—Great is the Truth, and it will overcome.</q>

Error in it ſelf. You will, when you have read our Anſwer, the better judg whether he hath prov'd the Baptiſm of Infants to be from Heaven, as in the Title of his Book he aſſerts it is. He farther ſays,</p>

               <q>We are Fathers, and the Law of Nature teacheth us to preſerve the Inheritance of our Children.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Our Affections are not leſs to our Children than his; we are <hi>Fathers alſo,</hi> but are not willing to give an Inheritance to our Children which of right belongs not unto them.</p>
            <p>Grace, nor gracious Privileges, in the New Covenant, come to be the Inheritance of our Children, in a Natural way, as they are our Off-ſpring; tho evident it is in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Peculiarity God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Jews and their Seed, as ſuch, had an Inheritance given them by the Lord, <hi>i. e.</hi> many Legal and External Privileges, beſides the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which Circumciſion was a Token or Sign of; but we and our Children have no right to that Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: They had the <hi>Shadow,</hi> we and our Children that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve have the <hi>Subſtance;</hi> they had the <hi>Shell,</hi> we the <hi>Kernel:</hi> The true Inheritance is by Faith, that it might appear to be of Grace, and not in Circumciſion, nor in Baptiſm, but by Faith only. Therefore when our Children are called of God, or do believe in Chriſt, they have right to the Inheritance which Baptiſm is a ſign of; and what ſignifies the ſign with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the thing ſignified? You our Brethren the <hi>Pedo-baptiſts</hi> give your Children the Name, but not the Nature of Chriſt; what is the lofty Title of Earl, or Duke, and no Eſtate ſute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that fancy'd Honour?</p>
            <p>
               <q>Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith, We are Stewards over the Houſe of God, and we ought to protect the Feeble and Afflicted; we are Shepherds, and our duty is to provide for the Lambs of the Flock, lest any caſt them out of the Fold.</q>

               <hi>Reply.</hi> It is required in Stewards that they be Faithful, and to ſee that they give no portion of their Maſters Goods to any, but to ſuch he hath directed and commanded them ſo to do: Now Chriſt hath commanded his Stewards, or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, no more to give Infants the Holy Ordinance of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm than the Lord's Supper.

               <hi>Reply.</hi> Becauſe the old <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by God's appointment, was built with dead Stones which was a Type of the New, will he, without Chriſt's Authority, build his New and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with ſuch Materials? We deny not but that God did receive Infants, as ſuch, into his old Building: But doth not St. <hi>Peter</hi> tell us, the Goſpel-Temple is built up with Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Stones, lively, or living Stones, <hi>i. e.</hi> Men and VVomen ſpiritually quickned by Divine Grace, or renewed by the Holy Spirit. Let him prove, if he can, that Chriſt received into the Goſpel-Church any one Infant; and tho we deny not but elect Infants that die may be lively Stones in <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem Above,</hi> I mean Heaven; yet it follows no more from thence that Infants ought to be baptized, than that they ought to partake of the Lord's Supper. Moreover, evident it is, that <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 9. (the Text Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> quotes) doth deny ſuch to have a right to Baptiſm that were the Seed or Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the Fleſh; <hi>Think not to ſay within your ſelves, we have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father.</hi> The Covenant of Peculiarity God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> tho it gave right to his Male-Infants to Circumciſion, yet it gives no right to Goſpel-Baptiſm to any, either Young or Old, Male nor Female. God can raiſe up of Stones Children to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, i. e.</hi> ſuch that have no Descent from <hi>Abraham:</hi> So that it appears Fleſhly Deſcent in Goſpel Times, ſignifies not any thing as to Goſpel-Church-Memberſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Worthy Britains,</hi> Search the Scriptures, and be not miſtaken about the Covenant God made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> you will find
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:65865:6"/>
the Covenant of Grace was one and the ſame from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and it was always held forth by way of a Free Promiſe, firſt to <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> but there was a Covenant made with <hi>Noah,</hi> and tho it was full of Mercy to him and all Mankind, yet that was not ſimply in it ſelf the Covenant of Grace: So alſo there was a Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Natural Seed, as ſuch, which we call a Covenant of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity, or, which peculiarly did appertain to his Natural Seed or Off-ſpring; to which Covenant Circumciſion did belong, which was diſtinct to the Free Promiſe, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, which God made with him, and with all the Elect in him. You may aſſure your ſelves that that Covenant in which there was mutual Reſtipulation between God and <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Carnal Seed, or between God and the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (and upon the Condition of Obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, Life, length of Days, and the Earthly <hi>Canaan</hi> was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and upon their Diſobedience Temporal Death was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) was not the Covenant of Grace, tho it might be given in ſubſerviency to the Goſpel-Covenant, or the Covenant of Faith: And ſo it was as a School-maſter to bring them to Chriſt. 'Tis only the Holy Spirit, thro Faith, that actually intiles us or our Children to the Covenant of Grace: We muſt believe, and our Children muſt believe, before either we or they can be actually in this Bleſſed Covenant, ſo as to have right to Baptiſm, I mean ſuch of them that live, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo know, as I ſaid before, that it is not the Covenant of Grace ſimply conſidered in it ſelf that gives any Perſon a right to Goſpel-Baptiſm, but the meer poſitive and expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, Will and Pleaſure of Chriſt the only Lawgiver: For the Covenant of Grace gave no Godly Man or his Male-Children, in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Time, or before or after, any right to Circumciſion, but only God's Command to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which ran to thoſe that proceeded from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Loins,</hi> or were bought with his Money. Brethren, Can any think that <hi>Abraham</hi> could purchaſe Men with Money, and that way bring them into the Covenant of Grace? No, 'tis nothing but the Purchaſe of Chriſt's Blood can do that.</p>
            <p>In a word it is evident, that ſhould we grant all that Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> and other <hi>Pedo-Baptiſts</hi> ſay, That all the Children of Believers were in very deed in the Covenant of Grace; yet it would not follow from thence, that our Infants ſhould be baptized, any more than that they ought to have the Lord's Supper given to them, as I ſaid before; becauſe both
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:65865:6"/>
thoſe Ordinances (as Circumciſion was) are abſolutely of meer poſitive Right: Therefore we muſt know that 'tis the Will and Command of Chriſt in the New Teſtament, that Infants ought to be baptized, if they have right thereunto; but ſince there is not the leaſt Intimation given, in all God's Word, that 'tis his Pleaſure they ſhould be baptized, it muſt be a piece of Will-worſhip to do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But whereas 'tis objected, it may be gathered from Conſequences that 'tis our Duty to baptize them.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, In point of inſtituted Worſhip, or for any meer po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Legal or Goſpel Ordinance, there ought to be an expreſs Precept; tho we grant that many <hi>Doctrinal Truths</hi> may be drawn or inferred by Conſequences from many Texts of Scripture. See Reverend Mr. <hi>Greenhil,</hi> on <hi>Ezek. chap. 11. Vol. 2. p.</hi> 412. <q>VVhat is clearly held out unto us in the Goſpel (ſaith he) let us conſent in, and walk anſwerably; in what is dark and doubtful let us forbear each other, and ſtay till God reveals more. If we cannot unite in all, let us unite in what is clear. Things Fundamental are cleareſt laid down in the word; they are expreſly commanded or held forth in Scripture, whether they are Matters of Faith or Practice, they are not drawn out by remote Conſequences, and ſtrength of Men's Parts, but immediately from or in the VVord.</q> Thus Mr. <hi>Greenhill.</hi> Now we all agree that Baptiſm, tho it be not a Fundamental of Salvation, yet 'tis a Fundamental of Church-Conſtitution; there can be no true, right, orderly Goſpel-Church, without Baptiſm. Therefore it is neceſſary that this ſhould be laid down plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Word of God; and ſo it is. We muſt firſt be <hi>made Diſciples, and then be baptized,</hi> Mat. 28. 19, 20. John 4. 1. firſt <hi>believe, and then be baptized,</hi> Mark 16. 16. <hi>Repent and be baptized,</hi> Acts 2. 37. <hi>If thou believeſt thou mayeſt,</hi> Acts 8. 37. <hi>Can any Man forbid Water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized?</hi> Acts 10. 47. <hi>When they believed</hi> Philip, <hi>preaching the things concerning the Kingdom of Grd, and the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, they were baptized both Men and Women,</hi> Acts 8. 12. So Acts 16. 30, 31. Acts 18. 8. Rom. 6. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>And as touching thoſe Conſequences that Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> and others draw from ſome Scriptures, to prove Infants Baptiſm, you will find in the enſuing Anſwer, thoſe Conſequences do not ariſe naturally from thoſe Texts, but are only his own ungrounded Suppoſitions, and miſtaken Apprehenſions.

               <hi>Rep.</hi> Here are a heap of words in a confuſed manner wrap'd up together, without diſtinguiſhing one Covenant from another, and without diſtinguiſhing between Seed and Seed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the Covenant of Grace God made with <hi>Adam,</hi> was alſo to all his Seed, How happy is the whole VVorld? All are <hi>Adam</hi>'s Natural Seed. Be ſure that was the Covenant of Grace, and the firſt diſcovery of it; and this runs only to Chriſt, the Seed of the VVoman, and to all the Elect in him; not to the Seed of the Serpent who were nevertheleſs <hi>Adam</hi>'s Natural Seed, as I ſhewed you before.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God's Covenant with <hi>Noah</hi> had Grace in it, and he was in the Covenant of Grace himſelf; but that Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 9. was alſo made with all the VVorld, and with the Beaſts of the Field, and Fowls of Heaven, <hi>even with every Living Creature.</hi> Yet we will acknowledg thus much, <hi>i. e.</hi> that all Covenants God made with Man ſince the Fall, originally did ſpring from his ſpecial Love to his Elect, and New Covenant-Grace deſigned for them; and ſo they were chiefly for their Sakes: But every diſtinct Covenant we read of was not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, and formally the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Covenants with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in this Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> was Twofold, as he was a twofold Father, Head and Repreſentative, and had a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Seed. (1.) The Covenant or Free-Promiſe of Grace God made with him, the Apoſtle proves was <hi>not made to Seeds, as of many, but to thy Seed, that is Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3. 16. <hi>If any Man be in Chriſt, he is one of</hi> Abraham'<hi>s Seed, and an Heir according to the Promiſe,</hi> ver. 29. (2.) The Covenant of <hi>Peculiarity</hi> God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, we deny not, refers to all his Natur. I Seed, or Fleſhly Seed, as ſuch, to
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:65865:8"/>
which Circumciſion did appertain: But this will do the <hi>Pedo-Baptiſts</hi> no ſervice. The Covenant God made with <hi>David</hi> runs primarily to Chriſt, and in him to all the Elect; this is the Eternal Covenant indeed.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith, The Evangelical Prophet foretelleth that the Covenant of Grace ſhould be of the ſame extent under the Goſpel, even as it was from the Beginning, Iſa. 66. 22. <hi>For as the new Heavens ſhall remain before me, ſo ſhall your Seed remain.</hi> God's Covenant with the Seed of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is ſo ſtedfaſt as the new Heavens and the new Earth.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Reply.</hi> This all Men know only refers to the Elect Seed, and not to the Seed of the Faithful, as ſuch.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We deny not but the Covenant of Grace is of the ſame extent in the Goſpel-Days as it was from the Beginning. But from the Beginning none were truly and really in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, but the Elect of God only.</p>
            <p>But what Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> in the cloſe of his ſecond Epiſtle, hath ſaid, may open the Eyes of his Reader, tho his own be ſhut. Take his words.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Diſtinguiſh between the outward Diſpenſation of the Covenant and the inward Diſpenſation thereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4, 8. All the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> was in the outward Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, and the Seal of the Covenant belonged unto them; but none were in the inward Diſpenſation, ſave the Elect only.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Are not all Men in the VVorld, eſpecially where the Goſpel is preached, in or under the outward Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, or Covenant of Grace? Sure none can deny this. But doth Baptiſm therefore belong to them all? All the Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> we acknowledg were in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Diſpenſation of the Law, or Covenant of Peculiarity God made with him; and had great external Privileges thereby, which in ſome things much differed from the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of ſuch who are under the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel: But let them be what they will, the outward Diſpenſation of the Goſpel of Grace, doth belong as far forth to Unbelievers and their Children, as to the Children of Believers: For what is that more than the Privilege of reading and hearing the Goſpel preached, or attending on the Word, in Chriſtian Aſſemblies?</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ask Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> how he can prove that the Seal of the Covenant of Grace doth belong to them who are only in the outward Diſpenſation of the Goſpel? This may ſeem ſtrange
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:65865:9"/>
to all thinking Men. They whom the Seal of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace belongeth unto, are aſſured of all of the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Immunities, Bleſſings, and Privileges thereof, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Sin, Juſtification, Adoption, and Eternal Life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Tho I own no Seal, or nothing to be a Seal of the Covenant of Grace, ſave the Holy Spirit; Yet, was Baptiſm the Seal of it, as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſuppoſeth, certainly it muſt (if it were ſo) ſeal to the Perſon baptized all thoſe Spiritual Bleſſings or inward Graces ſignified thereby; or otherwiſe the Seal would be an inſignificant thing, and the Party ſealed would but be cheated or deceived: He may think he hath ſome great Matter ſealed to him, when in truth he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſealed thereby. Pray ask this Man what it is that Baptiſm ſeals to Infants?</p>
            <p n="4">4. But is it ſo indeed, Are none in the inward part of the Covenant of Grace, or in the inward Diſpenſation of the the Goſpel, but the Elect; then I infer that the Children of the Faithful, as ſuch, are not in the Covenant of Grace, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Spiritual Bleſſings or <hi>Fatneſs</hi> of that Covenant doth not belong to them, as ſuch, but only to ſuch of them as are elected, or who do believe, or are brought under ſpecial Vocation by the Holy Spirit. And theſe things being ſo, to what purpoſe is it for this Man, and other <hi>Pedo-Baptiſts,</hi> to make ſuch a Noiſe about the Children of Believers, as ſuch, being in the Covenant of Grace? whereas he confeſſeth none are indeed in it but the Elect. I cannot ſee it is any thing he and others contend for, in pleading for Infant-Baptiſm, but only a Chriſtian-Name, or ſome outward thing, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Grace not belonging to any but to the Elect only; and who they are cannot be known till each Perſon comes to Age, and is called by the Lord: For it is only by effectual Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that the Election of Perſons is known to themſelves or others.</p>
            <p>But to conclude, Let me add a word or two to you <hi>Pedo-Baptiſts</hi> that are ſound in the Doctrine of Free Grace, and Free Juſtification by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs alone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> May it not be worth your moſt ſerious Thoughts, to conſider how the Doctrine of <hi>Pedo-Baptiſm</hi> is a direct Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of that Holy Precept of our Bleſſed Saviour, Mar. 5. 33, 34. <hi>It hath been ſaid of them of old Time, Thou ſhalt not forſwear thy ſelf, but ſhall perform to the Lord thine Oaths. But I ſay unto you, ſwear not at all, &amp;c.</hi> All voluntary and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſary Oaths and Vows, and Religious Covenants, (as well
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:65865:9"/>
as vain Swearing) is directly thereby forbid, and therefore ſinful. Now tho we grant that the true Baptiſmal Covenant is of Divine Inſtitution, yet ſince that only obligeth thoſe that are the true Subjects thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> Believers: It followeth that that Vow or Covenant you bring your poor Babes under, being wholly without Divine Authority, it is therefore voluntary, and ſo forbid, and ſinful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is alſo directly repugnant to thoſe Precepts, <hi>Add not to his Word, leſt he reprove thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Conſider that Infants Baptiſmal Covenant is alſo directly repugnant to the nature of the Covenant of Grace, rendring the Covenant of Grace to be of the ſame nature of the Covenant of Peculiarity God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Natural Seed, as ſuch, and ſo ſutes only with the <hi>Baxterian</hi> Errors, and Mr. <hi>William</hi>'s <hi>New Scheme,</hi> which renders the Covenant of Grace conditional, according to the Covenant of Works. Take Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s words, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>The Condition of the Covenant of Grace, by which we have right to the Benefits of it, is our Faith (mark it) or Chriſtianity, as it is meant by Chriſt in the Baptiſmal Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> to give up our ſelves in Covenant, believing in God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, renouncing the Contraries; and that through this conſent to the Chriſtian Covenant (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Faith alone) is the full condition of our firſt right to the Benefits of that Covenant (of which Juſtification) is one. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Fourth Propoſit. in his Preface to Dr. <hi>Tully.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. From hence note, as Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> obſerves, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth not ſay that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, apprehended by Faith, doth juſtify us; but Faith in a comprehenſive Senſe, as it includeth Obedience to God, according to this Covenant. It appears that the Belief and Practice of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, upon performance of their Infant Baptiſmal-Covenant, is that Righteouſneſs by which they are juſtified, as the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Senſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From hence alſo, it appears that the Spring or Riſe of this grand <hi>Baxterian</hi> Error is from Infants-Baptiſmal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; therefore, Brethren, 'tis time to conſider the danger of this unwarrantable Practice and evil Innovation.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>D. Williams</hi> confirms Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Notion: Take his words, What doth the Covenant bind thee to (ſpeaking of Infants Baptiſmal-Covenant)? His Anſwer is, To be the Lord's; in ſincere Care, to know, love, believe, obey, worſhip and ſerve him all my days, and to depend on God, thro Chriſt, for all Happineſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:65865:10"/>
Queſt. <hi>What if a Child, thro the love of Sin, or vanity of Mind, will not agree to this Covenant?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, (ſaith he) <q>He then rejecteth Chriſt our Saviour, and renounceth the Bleſſings of the Goſpel.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Is it a great Sin to refuſe to agree to the Covenant to which thy Baptiſm engaged thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He anſwers, <q>It is the damning Sin, and the Heart of all Sin,</q> Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s Book, called <hi>The Vanity of Youth, pag.</hi> 131.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Reply.</hi> From hence it appears, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> plainly declare that the terms and condition of the Covenant of Grace, which muſt be performed by ſuch that would be juſtified, is to perform this Infant Baptiſmal-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>viz.</hi> ſincerely to love, believe, obey, worſhip and ſerve the Lord; not Faith only whereby we receive Chriſt, rely on Chriſt, but the whole of that Obedience to which they were obliged by their Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Obſerve alſo, that it appears according to theſe Men, that Unbelief is not the condemning Sin, but the non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this Baptiſmal-Covenant.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How are theſe Men left of God, to darkneſs of their own Minds, not only to affirm the Conditionality of the Covenant of Grace, rendering it no better than a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, but alſo to make this deviſed and voluntary Infant Baptiſmal-Covenant to be the only Condition of it, and of our Juſtification in the ſight of God?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Moreover, They bring their poor Babes (without any Authority from Chriſt) under a Covenant, and charge them with Perjury if they break it, when grown up; (it they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it they ſhall be pardoned, juſtified and ſaved) but they muſt be damn'd if they anſwer not the Rule of the Promiſe, or Baptiſmal-Covenant, which is to repent, to be regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſo anſwer their <hi>new Law of Faith and ſincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi> So that in this Covenant lies the Conditionality of their Covenant of Grace. For no other formal Covenant is propoſed by them to the People, unleſs they are for Mr. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph Allen</hi>'s voluntary Covenant, contrived out of his own Head, and propoſed to all devout Adult Perſons to enter into, which no doubt is forbid by our Saviour as ſinful: (he was a well-meaning Man.) And the Truth is, his deviſed Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſeems more plauſible and reaſonable than Infants Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal-Covenant, becauſe he would have none but ſuch enter into his Covenant who are Adult Perſons; beſides, it muſt be with their own free Conſent, whereas Children are brought into theirs, without their knowledg or conſent, and are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:65865:10"/>
to do thoſe things which they have no power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form: And as it is not required by the Lord, ſo God hath made no Promiſe to them, of Grace and Aſſiſtance, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Obligation thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To conclude, It is eaſy to gather from whence their Miſtake doth ariſe about this Baptiſmal-Covenant, which evidently appears to be from their applying it to falſe Subjects; (and ſo to bind ſuch to perform thoſe things which Chriſt never ordained Baptiſm to do,) <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch that are in their Natural State, or who when baptized believed not, nor were capable ſo to do; for your Brethren the <hi>Pedo-Baptiſts</hi> tell you that Baptiſm obligeth ſuch as are baptized to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and to become new Creatures, not that they were ſuch that then did believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And from hence it followeth, that it is one of thoſe Works or Acts of Obedience that go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Faith, and therefore a dead Work, and pleaſeth not God (as well as not required of him); for all Works before Faith, or Union with Chriſt, are dead Works, they not proceeding from a Spiritual Vital Principle.</p>
            <p>It therefore appears from hence, that Infant's Baptiſmal-Covenant is directly alſo repugnant to Chriſt's true Baptiſmal-Covenant: For evident it is, that Chriſt's Baptiſm only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Believers who are renewed, regenerated, and have Union with Chriſt, and ſo in a juſtified State before bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed: Our Baptiſm doth not oblige us to believe and to be regenerated, or to die to Sin, as ſuch that were not dead before; but it is a ſign of that Faith and Death unto Sin we had when we were baptized, or to ſhew that we were then dead to Sin, <hi>&amp;c. How ſhall we that are dead to Sin, live any longer therein? Know ye not that ſo many of us as were baptized into Jeſus Chriſt, were baptized into his Death?</hi> Or as being dead with him, <hi>Therefore we are buried with him into Death,</hi> Rom. 6. 2, 3, 4. Not buried alive or whilſt dead in Sin: No, but as being dead to Sin. Not to oblige us to be regenerated, but, as Perſons who are regenerated before, buried in Baptiſm. And the Covenant of Baptiſm is, to walk in newneſs of Life, as being before quickned, <hi>That like as Chriſt was raiſed from the dead by the Glory of the Father, ſo we ſhould walk in newneſs of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I find Mr. <hi>Richard Baxter</hi> alſo ſaith, Baptiſm is a ſign of preſent Regeneration, not future. Now, how inconſiſtent is this Infant Baptiſmal-Covenant to the Covenant of Grace, and alſo to the nature of that Baptiſmal-Covenant, Believers, or true juſtified Perſons, enter into when baptized, according
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:65865:11"/>
to Chriſt's Inſtitution? Nothing can be more clear than this, <hi>viz.</hi> that Infant's Baptiſmal-Covenant is of the ſame nature with the Covenant of Circumciſion, <hi>viz.</hi> a conditional legal Covenant, <hi>Do this, and thou ſhalt live;</hi> perform the Obligation, and thou ſhalt be juſtified, but do it not, and you ſhall be damned, or be cut off: So that Infant-Baptiſm eſtabliſhed the old legal conditional Covenant. Let ſuch who hold the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Free-Grace conſider it; and alſo ſee whether it doth not render the Covenant of Grace different in its nature in reſpect had to Believers themſelves, and to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: For Believers themſelves receive Chriſt as Sinners, by Faith only, without any previous Qualification, or promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory Covenant, that Chriſt hath obliged them to enter into: But their Infants are put upon previous conditional Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, which muſt be performed by them before juſtified. Indeed had Chriſt ordained Baptiſm to oblige us to believe, to repent, to die to Sin, to be regenerate, as the <hi>Pedo-Baptiſt</hi> ſpeak of their Baptiſm doth do, it was ſomething to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but the contrary plainly appears. Were theſe things carefully conſidered, I am ſure Infant-Baptiſm would fall to the ground; for the nature of their pretended Baptiſmal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is quite repugnant to the true Baptiſmal Covenant Chriſt inſtituted, therefore pernicious: Beſides, how are thoſe baptized Infants in the Covenant of Grace, (as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> and others ſay) and yet Baptiſm (as to the main De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>n and End of it in their cloudy Conceits and Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) is to oblige them to believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they may actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be in the Covenant of Grace. The good Lord give you Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in all things, and bleſs to your Profit what I have wrote, and praiſe God for that Readineſs that was in your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Countrymen to be at the great Charge of the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Owen.</hi> He ſaith, in the Title of his Book, <hi>Childrens Baptiſm is from Heaven.</hi> Strange! yet no where inſtituted, nor any Authority for it, or ever owned from Heaven; certainly you will find it is of Men, and ſprang out of the Antichristian Apoſtacy. Search the Scripture, be like the Noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> Acts 16. 11. <hi>Who with all Readineſs of Mind received the Truth, and ſearched the Scriptures daily, whether thoſe things were ſo.</hi> Brethren, I ſhall add no more, but commit you to God, and intreat you to read this Book over and over without Prejudice; and if you receive any Light by it, give God the Glory, for I deſire to be nothing; yet am willing ſtill to ſerve you, and the Intereſt of Chriſt, who ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe my ſelf your Servant for Jeſus Sake,</p>

               <hi>Becauſe this Controverſy was never before printed in the</hi> Welch Tongue, <hi>as I am informed (as it is here) I was therefore willing the Godly in</hi> Wales, <hi>or any of the</hi> Antient Britains <hi>that deſired Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation herein, might ſee the main Arguments that other</hi> Pedo-Baptiſts <hi>have brought for Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm fully anſwered: The Subſtance therefore of Mr.</hi> Burkitt'<hi>s late Book is in this alſo anſwered, and divers others; nay, there is ſcarcely an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that hath been brought for Infant-Baptiſm for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, or of late, but 'tis here anſwered: Alſo, I have, in following Mr.</hi> Owen <hi>in his Repetitions, been forced to repeat ſome things often which may add to the Bulk; but they being chiefly ſome of the main Points, I did it on purpoſe, to the end they might have the greater Influence upon the Reader. Moreover, I have ſhewed that moſt of Mr.</hi> Owen'<hi>s Arguments for the baptizing of Children, tend every way as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly to prove they ought to partake of the Lord's Supper alſo; which I deſire may be carefully weighed and conſidered: I have often repeated that on purpose.</hi>

               <hi>And now to conclude, Let me deſire you to labour to adorn the Holy Goſpel you profeſs, with a sutable and becoming Converſation; 'tis not an External Ordinance that ſignifies any thing, without true Faith and a Godly Life. You have</hi> Lamps, <hi>but O ſee you have Oyl in your Veſſels; not that I blame you for your great Zeal for this precious, tho deſpiſed Truth of Chriſt, conſidering what a Glorious and Illuſtrious Inſtitution or Bleſſed Ordinance it is, as appears,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By the Obedience of our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf unto it, which puts a great Luſtre and Glory up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In that it is called a fulfilling of that Righteouſneſs which the Holy Goſpel calls for; and ſuch who fail herein are imperfect touching their doing the whole Will of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>In that it was ſo gloriouſly owned at the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of our Saviour, by the Father, nay by the whole</hi> Trinity. <hi>By the Father, by a Voice from Heaven: The Son by his actual Obedience to it as our Example, when we believe: The Holy Ghoſt by deſcending like</hi> a Dove, <hi>in a viſible manner, and reſting upon our Bleſſed Lord; this was the time when he was gloriouſly ſealed,</hi> Mat. 3. 16, 17.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>In that hereby all baptized Believers do ſignify their ſtedfaſt Faith in the Bleſſed Trinity, and do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote themſelves to ſerve and worſhip the Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Godhead,</hi> Mat. 28. 19, 20.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Becauſe it doth ſo clearly bold forth and confirm us in the ſtedfaſt Belief of the Death, Burial and Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, and of our Reſurrection at the laſt Day,</hi> Rom. 6. 3, 4.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:65865:13"/>
6. <hi>Alſo conſidering the many great and gracious Promiſes made to ſuch Believers who are baptized, as</hi> Mark 16. 16. Acts 2. 37, 38.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Conſidering what a ſignificant Ordinance it is, in reſpect had to that Death to Sin and Vivification to a new Life, in all its true and proper Subjects, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with that Obligation it lays them under,</hi> Rom. 6. 3, 4. Col. 2. 12, 13.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>That it is particularly called the Counſel of God, and ſuch who refuſed to be baptized, are left on Sacred Record under that black Odium of rejecting the Counſel of God,</hi> Luke 7. 30.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>'Tis a great Ordinance, appears in that it is an Initiatory Ordinance into the Viſible Church,</hi> Acts 2. 41, 42.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>In that thoſe who were baptized with the Holy Spirit, were nevertheleſs commanded to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with Water,</hi> Acts 10. 48.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The higheſt Gifts of the Spirit cannot exempt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from their Obedience hereunto: Moreover, we have herein alſo Fellowſhip with Chriſt in his Death and Reſurrection. Therefore let none rob you of Chriſt's own Baptiſm; be not cheated with a listle filthy Droſs, of Chriſt's pure Gold, nor endure to ſee your Lord's Wine mixt with filthy Puddle-Water: Yet carry it with all Chriſtian Charity, Love and Humility towards all Godly Chriſtians that differ in this Matter from you, and ſtrive to walk as you are obliged by your Holy Baptiſm to do; then will God have Glory, and you have Peace; to whoſe Holy Care, Bleſſing, and Protection, I ſhall commit you; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main your unworthy Brother, in the Sacred Bonds of the Goſpel,</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>In anſwer to what Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> hath ſaid in his firſt Chapter.</p>
            </argument>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS to what you ſay about the Tree of Life, and Tree of Knowledg, that they were Seals of the two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Covenant of Works, and of the Covenant of Grace, or free Promiſe of God, it is far fetch'd and very doubtful, and as little to the Purpoſe for which you mention them; therefore I ſhall paſs that by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> As touching Circumciſion being a dark Shadow of the Old Covenant under the Old Diſpenſation, it may be granted; but that it was the Seal of the Covenant of Grace (which you affirm elſewhere in your Book) I do deny, it being only a Seal of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, even of that Faith he had, being yet Uncircumciſed, and alſo that he ſhould be the Father of all that ſhould believe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> You ſay well that thoſe dark Shadows, <hi>viz.</hi> Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are aboliſhed; the Subſtance being come, that Yoke of Bondage is taken away: which proves Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion did not appertain to the Covenant of Grace, as the Seal of it, in common to all Believers; for the breaking off of a Seal cancels the Covenant to which it was prefixed, as all Men know: So that nothing can be more clear than this, that Circumciſion, if it was a Seal of any Covenant, (as you conceive it was) it was a Seal of the Covenant of Works, which neither our Fathers nor we were able to bear, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it obliged all that were circumciſed to keep perfectly the whole Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> You ſay, <q>
                  <hi>Chriſt hath ordained in the Goſpel a light and eaſy Burden,</hi> viz. <hi>Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper.</hi> Theſe two are the only. Sacraments, you ſay, of the Goſpel.</q> This is granted and owned, herein we do not differ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly.</hi> You ſay, <hi>Baptiſm ſignifieth our Spiritual Birth, the Lord's Supper our Spiritual Growth and Nouriſhment.</hi> This we
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65865:18"/>
grant alſo, and therefore we ſay Baptiſm cannot belong to Infants, becauſe they are not in an ordinary way capable of Regeneration (tho we deny not that thoſe elect Infants that die, are renewed <hi>quoad illorum naturas,</hi> but we know not which they are; if we did, yet we ought not to baptize them, becauſe we have no Precept or Precedent ſo to do: we might therefore as well and by as good Authority, give them the Lord's Supper as B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ptiſm, which the antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when firſt Pedo-baptiſm was, by Human Authority, introduced into the Church (you know) did for near four hundred Years, till the latter end of the Sixth Century.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6thly.</hi> You ſay, <q>
                  <hi>Baptiſm, according to the Signification of the Word, is Waſhing;</hi> and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, ſaved us by the waſhing of Regeneration, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is rendered, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. in divers Baptiſms, thoſe were not only by dipping under Water, but by ſprinkling Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on thoſe baptized, as the Apoſtle teacheth <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 19. he took the Blood of the Calves, and of Goats, with Water, and ſprinkled the Book and all the People.</q> That which the Apoſtle (you ſay) called Baptiſm in <hi>Ver.</hi> 10. is in this Verſe called the Sprinkling of Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer, tho the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in a remote Senſe, doth take in Waſhing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> yet I challenge you and all that know (or pretend to know) the Greek Tongue, whether in every place in the New Teſtament where the Word is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, or any Derivative from it, (as it refers to Chriſt's Ordinance of Baptiſm) it doth not directly and properly ſignify Immerſion, and accordingly rendred by <hi>Beza</hi> in his Tranſlation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> You greatly wrong that Text, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 19. where the Apoſtle <hi>ſpeaks of ſprinkling the Blood of Calves, and of Goats with Water,</hi> &amp;c. by ſaying he refers to <hi>Ver.</hi> 10. where the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>Divers Waſhings;</hi> and in thus doing, you do not only abuſe the Sacred Text, but you wrong your own Soul and Conſcience, and the People alſo. Sir, do you find the Greek Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (which is in <hi>ver.</hi> 10.) in <hi>ver.</hi> 19. where ſprinkling is mentioned? or is it not in <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 19. as alſo 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>? We may modeſtly affirm that no Greek Author, whether Heatheniſh or Chriſtian, has ever put Baptizing for Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or uſed thoſe Words promiſcuouſly; for as in theſe Scriptures you have cited, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13, 19, 21. 'tis always tranſlated Sprinkling, ſo there is not one place in Scripture
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65865:18"/>
wherein the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is rendred Baptiſm, nor is there one Scripture where <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is rendred Sprinkling. And therefore, tho ſometimes the Greek Word doth ſignify in a remote Senſe, Waſhing, yet 'tis primarily ſuch a waſhing as is by dipping or plunging, as I ſaid before: And thus Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> in his Dictionary, renders <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>tingo, &amp;c.</hi> to dip or plunge into the Water; <hi>and ſignifies,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>primarily ſuch a waſhing as is uſed in Bucks, where Linen is plunged or dipped;</hi> tho in a remote Senſe, he hints, it ſignifies other kind of waſhing; but it does not ſo in the Holy Scripture where the Word is uſed, as referring to Chriſt's Ordinance of Baptizing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> You ſay, <q>Water-Baptiſm, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Waſhing of the Fleſh, ſignifies the Waſhing of the Spirit, and therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, Even Baptiſm doth now ſave us, not the putting away the Filth of the Fleſh, but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of a good Conſcience towards God, by the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, you confound Regeneration with Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; the waſhing of Regeneration is not the waſhing of Baptiſm: Baptiſm regenerates no Perſon.

            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> If Baptiſm is an Evidence of our Faith in Chriſt, then it muſt only belong to Believers. How can it be an Evidence of Faith in Infants who are not capable to believe? they know not the Object of Faith, nor can they exert any Act of Faith. It muſt be an Evidence to the Subject when baptized, and ſo the Scriptures you cite hold forth: <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mark 16. 16. it doth not ſay, he that is baptized and believeth. <hi>If thou believeſt with all thy Heart thou mayſt:</hi> Not if thou ſhalt believe hereafter, but if thou doſt believe now. It appertains to ſuch who have Faith when baptized, and it evidences ſuch a Faith to the Perſon; nay Faith is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them before they are to be baptized. And ſo ſaith the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> Still, Reader, know that it is a Bond to the Adult only, Infants are not able to die to Sin, nor live unto Holineſs: They cannot anſwer a good Conſcience by the Reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead. Ordinances have no more Virtue in them to an Infant, than if you ſhould water a dead Tree. There can be no increaſe in Holineſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Grace of Holineſs in the Habit be firſt infuſed; and if the Seed of Holineſs be [firſt] infuſed in Infants before Baptiſm, or in Baptiſm, that Seed would remain in them, and appear as ſoon as they come to Underſtanding, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9. But that any ſuch Seed or vital Principle is either way in Infants as ſuch, whether Infants of Believers, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, appears not; but contrary-wiſe, nothing appears in them when grown up, but the curſed Seed of Sin, and ſo it will until their Natures be changed by Divine Grace.</p>

               <hi>4thly.</hi> You ſay, <q>Baptiſm is a ſign of Union with Chriſt, we were baptized into him: <hi>For as many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt;</hi> Gal. 3. 27. Again, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We are all baptized into one Body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13. Chriſt is the Head of the Body, the Faithful are the Members, thoſe that are in everlaſting Union with him, which is ſignified in Baptiſm: Can they deſire to be in one Body with Chriſt, who are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be baptized into this Union?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark.</hi> Have Infants, as ſuch, Union with Chriſt? If they have, they would all partake of the Bleſſings of that Union, and be all ſaved, becauſe the Branch that is ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united to the Vine Chriſt, partakes of the Virtue that is in him; and it is an indiſſolvable Union, like that between the Father and the Son, <hi>John</hi> 17. 21, 23. You ſay the Union is everlaſting, and this is ſignified in Baptiſm. Now what is the Sign without the Thing ſignified? Sir, no doubt elect Infants that die have Union with Chriſt in a way we are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of, but what is this to the Infants of Believers as ſuch? I will appeal to your own Conſcience, whether you believe any one Infant you baptize, (or rather rantize, or ſprinkle) that lives, hath ſpiritual Union with Chriſt, before, or in Baptiſm, or Rantiſm; for if they had, they do not after they are grown up need any inſpired Habit, or the Seed of Grace to be infuſed into them, in order to ſuch Union. Without Faith there is no Union with Chriſt, and there can be no Faith without Knowledg; there is no ſpiritual Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to Chriſt without a Conſent, which Infants are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. Moreover, why do you ſpeak of Perſons being not willing to be baptized, when the Subject of Baptiſm you contend for is a poor ignorant Babe? Can Infants be willing? Sir, what you ſpeak has weight in it to the <hi>Adult,</hi> to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, but ſignifies nothing for the Continuation of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to Infants, but rather that it ought to be rejected, as not being of God.</p>

            <p>AS to what is contain'd in the ſecond Chapter of your Book concerning the Continuation of Chriſt's Baptiſm of Water in the Church, I ſhall ſay no more to that, in that we agree, and are one: but we differ about what Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Water is; you would have it to be Sprinkling,

which indeed is not Baptiſm but <hi>Rantiſm,</hi> for that you know is the Greek Word for Sprinkling.</p>

               </gap>is poſitively ſaid, that <hi>John was baptizing in</hi> Enon <hi>near</hi> Salim, (John 3. 23.) <hi>becauſe there was much Water there.</hi> Certainly the Holy Ghoſt would not have given this as the Reaſon why <hi>John</hi> baptized near <hi>Enon, viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was much Water in that place, if a little Water, namely a Spoonful or two, would have been ſufficient, or two or three Quarts: It ſeems plainly deducible from this Text, it cannot be adminiſtred with a little Water, but contrariwiſe it doth require much Water.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly;</hi> Pray conſider, that as the Sacrament of the Lord's-Supper holds forth, or repreſents (ſymbolically) the breaking of the Body of Chriſt, and the ſhedding of his Blood, (and to that purpoſe it was in part inſtituted)
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65865:22"/>
even ſo the Sacrament of Baptiſm holds forth in as lively Figure, that our bleſſed Lord was dead, buried, and roſe again; and to this end this holy Ordinance was alſo inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, as alſo to ſhew <hi>forth our Death unto Sin, and Vivifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to Newneſs of Life,</hi> as by and by ſhall be abundantly proved, both from the holy Scriptures, and a multitude of learned Men that hold Infant-Baptiſm: therefore ſince a little Water cannot in this Ordinance repreſent Chriſt's Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and Reſurrection, it follows directly that a little Water will not ſerve to baptize Perſons in, but that it muſt be adminiſtred in Rivers, Ponds, or places where there is much Water, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo much Water as that the Body may be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried or covered all over therein. But to proceed, you ſay, <q>Neither is dipping or ſprinkling eſſential unto this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but waſhing with Water, or putting Water on the Body; for the word <hi>Baptiſm</hi> ſignifies in the Greek waſhing with Water, as we cited (ſay you) from <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, now you have given away your Cauſe at once (or I am miſtaken); for if neither dipping nor ſprinkling be eſſential unto this Ordinance, but waſhing, what is become of your Baptiſm? Sir, all dipping in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is waſhing, tho all waſhing is not dipping; in that you hurt us not, but your ſprinkling is not waſhing. If a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould ſprinkle her foul Linen with a few drops of Water, would that be deem'd a waſhing of them? Again, if Sprinkling be not eſſential to Baptiſm, you have no Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm at all; take away the Body of a Tree, and there is no Tree. That thing can't be where the eſſential part of it is wanting. And now that the Greek Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> doth ſignify dipping, and ſuch a waſhing as is by dipping, we ſhall plainly ſhew, evince, and demonſtrate, and confirm it by ſuch Arguments and Authors that no unprejudiced ſober Perſon can any longer well remain doubtful about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and then we will examine your Objections.</p>

            <p>If you would, ſaith Dr. <hi>Du-Veil,</hi> attend to the proper Signification of the word; in the Synod of <hi>Caelichyth, Anno</hi> 816. where <hi>Wolfred</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> preſided: <q>Let, ſaith he, the Presbyters beware that when they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Sacrament of Baptiſm, they do not pour Water upon the Heads of the Infants, but let them be always plunged in the Font according to the Example of the Son of God himſelf, who was plunged in the Waters of <hi>Jordan.</hi>
               </q> Thus muſt the Ceremony be performed according to order: See Dr. <hi>Du-Veil</hi> on the <hi>Acts, Chap.</hi> 2. p. 5, 6, 7.</p>

Hence it came to paſs, that contrary to the Analogy, or intended Myſtical Signification of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all the Weſt, for the moſt part, has in this Age the uſe of <hi>Rantiſm,</hi> that is <hi>Sprinkling</hi> inſtead of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as <hi>Zep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> ſpeaks, to the great Scandal of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> who to this day plunge into the Water thoſe they baptize, and deny any one to be rightly baptized, who is not plunged into the Water, according to the Precept of Chriſt, as we find in <hi>Sylveſter Squropulus.</hi>

            <p>To conclude with this, take one Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> If the proper, literal and genuine Signification of the Greek word <hi>baptizo</hi> is dipping, or to dip, then ſprinkling is not baptizing: But the proper, literal and genuine Signification of the Greek word <hi>baptizo</hi> is dipping, or to dip: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Sprinkling is not Baptizing.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Proving Baptiſm is Dipping, by the Practice of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> FRom the Practice of the Primitive Times. I have already ſhewed, that <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> baptized in the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> who was the firſt that received Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to baptize. And <hi>Diodate</hi> on <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. ſays he plunged them in Water.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Piſcator</hi> alſo ſaith, the antient manner of baptizing was, that the whole Body was dipp'd into the Water.</p>
            <p>So ſaith the Aſſembly in their Annotations.</p>
            <p>Nav, ſay I, it had been a vain and needleſs thing for them to go to Rivers to baptize, if it had been only to ſprinkle a little Water on the Face; for a Quart of Water might have ſerved to have rantized a great number.</p>
            <p>And had Sprinkling or Rantizing been the Ordinance, there is no Reaſon left to conceive why they ſhould go to Rivers; nor would the Spirit of God have given that as the Reaſon why <hi>John</hi> baptized in <hi>Enon</hi> near <hi>Salim, viz.</hi> becauſe there was much Water, <hi>John</hi> 3. 23.</p>
            <p>But ſome ſtrive to contradict the Holy Ghoſt, by making People believe there was not much Water in that place.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Becauſe the Original reads not <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ms or Rivolets.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> What difference is there between much VVater, and many Waters? If they were Streams and Rivolets, tho not deep, yet if they were but a little while ſtopped with a Dam, they would ſoon riſe to be deep enough to ſwim in, as Experience ſhews: But 'tis enough, there he baptized, ſaith the Holy Spirit, for there was much Water, or many Waters; there [for, or becauſe] intimating plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Ordinance could not be adminiſtred with a little Water, but that it required many Waters, or much Water, a great deal more than a Baſon could hold, or you hold in your Hand.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:65865:26"/>
2. But 'tis objected, <hi>Sandy</hi>'s Travels tell us that they were ſo ſhallow, as not to reach above the Ankles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Muſt we believe God's Word, or a lying Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller? the Scripture ſaith there was much Water, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Waters, and he ſays there was but a little.</p>
            <p>2. In ſome ſhallow Rivolets we daily ſee, that in ſome places the Water is deep, and might it not be ſo in that? and this Traveller might not ſo curiouſly ſearch or examine the matter.</p>
            <p>3. Or might there not be a great Confluence of Water then, (as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> words it) and yet but little or ſhallow Water now, or when <hi>Sandys</hi> was there? Time alters Rivers as well, as other things. But if any ſeek after this manner to contradict the ſacred Text, to defend their Childiſh Practice of Rantiſm, they deſerve greatly to be blamed.</p>
            <p>Take this Argument.</p>
            <p>If the Holy Ghoſt gives it as the Reaſon why <hi>John</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in <hi>Enon</hi> near <hi>Salim, viz.</hi> becauſe there was much Water; then a little Water will not ſerve to baptize in.</p>
            <p>But the Holy Ghoſt gives this as the Reaſon why <hi>John</hi> baptized in <hi>Enon</hi> near <hi>Salim, viz.</hi> becauſe there was much Water: <hi>Ergo,</hi> a little Water will not ſerve to baptize in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> But to proceed; <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 9. 'tis ſaid Jeſus was baptized of <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Jordan.</hi> Now ſaith a Learned Man on the place, It had been Nonſenſe for St. <hi>Mark</hi> to ſay, that Jeſus was baptized in <hi>Jordan,</hi> if he had been ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, becauſe the Greek reads it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, into <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan:</hi> Could Jeſus be ſaid to be ſprinkled into the River <hi>Jordan?</hi> 'tis proper to ſay he was dipped into <hi>Jordan,</hi> and that is and was the Act, and nothing elſe beſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> They went down both into the Water, both <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> and the Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. What need had there been for them ſo to have done, had Baptiſm been ſprinkling? Sure <hi>Philip</hi> would not have put that Noble Perſon (who was a Man of great Authority under <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65865:26"/>
him in his Chariot, as ſome Miniſters do now in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Places of Worſhip; and thus Men make void the Command of Chriſt by their Traditions to the abuſe of Chriſtian Baptiſm, and Reproach of us that keep to his ſacred Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Daniel Rogers,</hi> a moſt worthy Writer, ſays in a Treatiſe of his, <q>It ought to be the Church's part to cleave to the Inſtitution, which is dipping, eſpecially it being not lest Arbitrary by our Church to the Diſcretion of the Miniſter, but required to dip or dive.</q> And further saith, <q>That he betrays the Church, whoſe Miniſter he is, to a diſordered Error, if he cleave not to the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</q>
            </p>
            <p>O, what abundance of Betrayers of the Truth and of Churches too, have we in theſe as well as in former days! How little is the Inſtitution of Chriſt, or Practice of the Primitive Churches minded by many good Men? Where is the Spirit of Reformation? And doubtleſs that famous Author, and Learned Critick in the Greek Tongue, <hi>Caſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon.</hi> was in the right: Take his words.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I doubt not (ſaith he) but, contrary to our Church's Intention, this Error having once crept in, is maintain'd ſtill, by the carnal Eaſe of ſuch, as looking more at themſelves than at God, ſtretch the Liberty of the Church in this caſe, deeper and further than either the Church her ſelf would, or the Solemneſs of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament may well and ſafely admit. Afterwards he ſaith, I conſeſs my ſelf unconvinced by Demonſtrations of Scripture for Infants ſprinkling.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, the Church gave too great Liberty; ſhe had no Power to alter in the leaſt matter, but to have kept exactly to the Inſtitution. She ſays dipping [or ſprinkling] that ſpoils all, that Addition gives Encouragement: VVho will dip the Perſon, that can believe the Church that ſprinkling may ſerve? And O! how hard is it to retract an Error which hath been ſo long, and ſo generally received, eſpecially when Carnal Eaſe and Profit attends the keeping of it up! and alſo when the true way of baptizing is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and look'd upon to be ſo contemptible a Practice, and thoſe who own it, and dare not act otherwiſe, vilified and reproached (by many) with the ſcurrilous Name of <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> &amp;c. altho we are as much againſt rebaptizing as any People in the VVorld can be.</p>

The Learned <hi>Cajetan</hi> upon <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 5. ſaith, Chriſt aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Water, therefore Chriſt was baptized by <hi>John,</hi> not by ſprinkling or pouring Water upon him, but by Immerſion, that is, by dipping or Plunging into the Water.</p>
            <p>Moreover, <hi>Muſculus</hi> on <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. calls Baptiſm dipping, and ſays the Parties baptized were dipped, not ſprinkled.</p>
            <p>To cloſe with this, take one Argument.</p>
            <p>If the Baptizer and the Baptized in the days of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, went both down into the Water, and the Perſon baptized was dipped, then is Baptiſm not Sprinkling but Dipping.</p>
            <p>But the Baptizer and the Baptized in the days of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, went both down into the Water, and the Perſon baptized was dipped.</p>

               </hi> saith in the beginning of his <hi>third Chapter, viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That it is uncertain, whether in the New Teſtament, the Apoſtles baptized by dipping or ſprinkling,</q> is not true, it being evident it was by dipping and no other way. For where-ever the word Baptiſm is uſed (I ſay again) in the New Teſtament, as it refers to Chriſt's Ordinance of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65865:27"/>
it ſignifies dipping or plunging into the Water; nor can he prove the Jews waſhed their Hands and Cups only by pouring Water on them: tho <hi>Elijah</hi> might have Water poured on his Hand, we commonly waſh our Hands and Cups by dipping them into the Water. And ſo did the Jews as Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> affirms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> Sir, what you ſay concerning that Typical Baptiſm in the Cloud and Sea, you have heard alſo fully anſwered, and that makes not for ſprinkling nor pouring. But more to that hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> What you ſay concerning the Signification of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, that it holds forth two things, 1. The Blood of Chriſt; 2. The Spirit of Chriſt, is far fetch'd: for the Lord's Supper holds forth the Blood of Chriſt; and we have no Ordinance ordain'd by Chriſt to hold forth in a Figure the ſprinkling or pouring forth of the Spirit; if Man has invented ſuch a thing, ſo be it. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> found out ſeven Sacraments with their ſignificant Signs, as they tell you, and they have the ſame Parity of Reaſon to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Sacraments without any Warrant from God's Word, as our Pedobaptiſts have for their baptizing, or rather rantizing or ſprinkling of Babes. True, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſprinkling of the Blood of Jeſus, but Baptiſm is no Figure of that, as you have heard, but primarily of the Death, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urial and Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Sir, you ſay, <q>Sprinkling is lawful, becauſe it is very probable that the Apoſtles themſelves did baptize by pouring or ſprinkling Water. <hi>Acts 2. 41. Then they that gladly received the word, were baptized; and the ſame day there were added unto them three thouſand Souls.</hi> It is not, you ſay, very probable that theſe three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand were plunged over Head and Ears in VVater; How could <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles, even twelve Men, baptize three thouſand in one day, yea in one half day? how could they change their Apparel? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer, wonder no more how three thouſand Perſons ſhou'd be baptized, <hi>i. e.</hi> dipped, in that ſhort time; 'tis ſufficient for any Chriſtian to believe it, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt haſt ſaid it.</p>
            <p>2. But whereas you ſay there were but twelve Men to adminiſter it, that is not true, there were the ſeventy Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples no doubt with them, who were Miniſters, and there might very probably be many more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:65865:28"/>
3. However, ſince Baptiſm is Immerſion, <hi>i. e.</hi> dipping, and the Text ſays they were baptized, it follows they were dipped into the Water. What you ſay about <hi>Ananias</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing <hi>Paul,</hi> and of <hi>Paul</hi>'s baptizing the Jaylor, proves nothing, 'tis meer ſtuff that deſerves no Anſwer.</p>
            <p>You ſay <hi>Paul</hi> was baptized in his Lodging when he was ſick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not ſaid he was ſick, nor that he was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in his Lodging, read the Text again; true, 'tis ſaid after he was baptized he received Strength. I have known multitudes of weak Perſons baptized by dipping in froſty Weather, in our cold Climate, and never took any harm thereby.</p>
            <p>We ſay Baptiſm is Dipping, and among many other Reaſons, we argue it muſt needs be ſo adminiſtred, becauſe <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt baptized in <hi>Jordan,</hi> and in <hi>Enon</hi> near <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim,</hi> becauſe there was much Water there; <hi>Mat. 3. 13. John</hi> 3. 23.</p>
            <p>You anſwer, <q>If ſome were baptized by dipping, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were baptized by pouring Water on them, as we proved (ſay you) before, therefore both ways are lawful.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I anſwer;</hi> 1. 'Tis well our way of dipping is owned by you as lawful and a right way; then do you and all others take heed how you ſpeak againſt us, who ſo adminiſter the holy Ordinance of Baptiſm; it appears we err not in ſo doing by your own Confeſſon.</p>
            <p>2. But whereas you ſay you have proved, that ſome were in the Primitive Time baptized by pouring Water on them, we have ſhewed your Proofs to be too ſhort and invalid.</p>
            <p>3. The way of the Adminiſtration of Chriſt's ſacred Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance was but one and the ſame in all the Churches of the Saints; and if ſome were baptized by dipping, and others by ſprinkling, or pouring Water upon them, then the Ordinance muſt have different Significations, which could not be anſwered on ſome Perſons, unleſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> they were both dipped and ſprinkled, and had water poured upon them, which is prepoſterous to imagine: for ſuch that were dipped or buried under the VVater, were thereby made in Sign and Signification conformable to the Death, Burial and Reſurrection of Chriſt, which we have ſo fully proved to be one great End of Baptiſm, that it cannot be den<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed; and ſuch who were only ſprinkled, they were
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65865:28"/>
taught thereby the ſprinkling of Chriſt's Blood, and of the Spirit, as you would have the Ordinance to ſignify, without any ground from God's VVord.</p>
            <p>Now how unlikely it is that both theſe ways were uſed, this being conſidered, I ſhall leave to all wiſe and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Perſons to think upon.</p>
            <p>You ſay in the next place, <q>That the Scripture doth not ſay in any place, when they were baptized they were dipped: If (ſay you) thoſe that are againſt ſprinkling, ſay that they gather ſo much by Conſequence from the fore-cited Scriptures, they ought to remember their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting Scriptural Conſequences when they are uſed by us for proving Infant-Baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>It being very doubtful whether thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that came unto him were dipped or plunged; for <hi>there went out unto him</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and all</hi> Judea, <hi>and all the Regions round about</hi> Jordan, <hi>and were baptized by him:</hi> We cannot judg (you ſay) that he baptized leſs than an hundred thouſand Men and Women, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there were (you ſay) much more People in thoſe Countries; but it being impoſſible for him to dip or plunge ſo many Men in ſo ſhort time of his Miniſtry, which continued but three Years, and of theſe three Years he lay in Priſon half a Year, ſo that he did neither preach or baptize but for two Years and a half. Vid. <hi>Lightf.</hi> vol. I. <hi>p.</hi> 234.</p>
               <p>If he had baptized fifty every day on theſe two Years and a half, which is not probable he could do, the whole you ſay is but forty five thouſand ſix hundred and twenty five, but he baptized much more, which could not be done by dipping or plunging; therefore it is reaſonable for us (you ſay) to judg that he ſprinkled or poured Water on them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p n="3">3.

            <p>You in the next place, mention that which we object concerning <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> who went both down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Water when the <hi>Eunuch</hi> was baptized.

(ſay you) that <hi>Rebecca</hi> went down into the Well, Does it follow that ſhe was plunged in it? You
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65865:30"/>
will ſay of your Maid-Servant, when ſhe goes to draw Water, ſhe went down into the River, your meaning is not that ſhe was plunged there.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, <hi>Rebecca</hi> might properly be ſaid to go down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Well, becauſe in ſome Wells there are ſeveral Steps or Stairs before we come to the Water; 'tis not ſaid ſhe went into the Water. Alſo who of us could ſay when our Servant-Maid went to draw Water, or fetch Water from a River, ſhe went into the River? if any do ſay ſo, they ſpeak not truly, but indeed do lie. Sir, take heed what you ſay, the Holy Ghoſt doth not ſay they went down to the Water, but <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, both went down into the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and he baptized him, <hi>i. e.</hi> dipp'd him, not rantiz'd him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You bring in our Objection againſt your Sprinkling taken from <hi>Rom. 6. 3, 4. Col. 2. 12, 13. viz.</hi> we are ſaid to be buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm into Death.</q> To this you ſay, <q>We bury by caſting Earth on the Body, and the pouring of Water, you ſay, doth repreſent it; it cannot be ſaid one was buried that was fallen under Water or Earth, unleſs he remains there for a time: he that deſcendeth into a Coal-pit is under the Earth, but is not buried by reaſon he cometh out from thence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; dipping therefore doth not ſignify a Burial, unleſs he that is dipped remains for a time under the Water.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer; 'Tis true, we do bury by caſting Earth on the dead Body, but 'tis ſo much Earth as covers the Corps all over, or elſe 'tis not buried. So if you pour Water on a Child until it is covered all over in Water, it may truly be ſaid that Child was buried in the Water, altho the bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Baptiſm is not by pouring Water in great abundance until it is covered, but by going into the Water and there to be dipped, or plunged all over, ſo that all may ſee the Body is buried under Water, as truly, ſymbolically, and as properly as if it had been buried in the Water. Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Tho a Perſon be laid in the Grave, and covered all over with Earth, tho it be but two Minutes, he may as truly and properly be ſaid to be buried, as he that lies there three Days, or a thouſand Years. But you would have Baptiſm to be no proper Repreſentation of a Burial, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Perſon baptized lies ſo long till he be drowned. Sir, Baptiſm doth repreſent the Death of Chriſt, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65865:30"/>
of the old Man, or Body of Sin, which is as ſufficiently held forth by a Minute or two, as by many Days.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And now, utterly to put to ſilence your vain Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I ſhall give the Senſe of a whole Cloud of Witneſſes, as to the proper Expoſition of thoſe Texts, <hi>Rom. 6. 3, 4. Col.</hi> 2. 12, 13. by and by; but if my honeſt Country-men do think you have given a better Senſe of the Words than all thoſe Learned Men, I will ſay no more.</p>
            <q>
               <p>You ſay, the Reſemblance then between Baptiſm doth not ſtand in the dipping of the Body ſo much as in the End of the Ordinance, in making us Partakers of Chriſt's Death, of his Life, and of his Aſcenſion, and of his ſitting on the Right hand of God.</p>
               <p>Baptiſm makes us to be planted together in the Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Death; yet there are none, you ſay, that plants Bodies in Water by baptizing them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 5.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We ſhall in our next Chapter finally determine this great Point, and plainly ſhew you by manifeſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, together with the joint Conſent and Agreement of a multitude of Learned Men, that were and are Pedo-baptiſts, that the Reſemblance between Death, Burial and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and Baptiſm, doth ſtand in the outward Sign of Dipping, as well as in our partaking of the Bleſſing of Chriſt's Death, Burial and Reſurrection. All know in the Ordinance of the Lord's-Supper the Signs are ſignificant, and no true Proteſtant will admit of ſuch an Adminiſtration of it, in which the breaking of Chriſt's Body, and the ſhedding of his Blood is not clearly repreſented to the ſight of our Eyes. Why is the Popiſh way of the Adminiſtration rejected, who deny the Laity the Cup, if there ought not to be an exact keeping to the direct Signs, as well as to bear in Mind the Thing ſignified thereby? Nay, Sir, I find you in your third Chapter to juſtify your ſprinkling ſtifly, by arguing for an Agreement between the Sign and the Thing ſignined, and that Baptiſm was not ordained to be a Sign or Symbol of the ſprinkling Chriſt's Blood, but of his Death, Burial and Reſurrection: It ſhall (God aſſiſting) be further demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</p>
            <p>Now let this be conſidered, That as in the Lord's-Supper it is ſuch a quantity of Bread and Wine that is to be uſed, that may repreſent his Body broken, and his Blood ſhed; and as that Sacrament was appointed to that very end and purpoſe, ſo in like manner we alſo ſay, ſo much Water
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65865:31"/>
muſt be uſed as may repreſent the Death, Burial and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of our bleſſed Saviour. But one Mr. <hi>Burkitt,</hi> a Pedo-baptiſt, ſaith in his Treatiſe of Infant-Baptiſm, <hi>That in the Sacraments it is not the quantity of Elements, but the Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy of them that ought to be attended to; in Circumciſion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it was not the quantity of Fleſh cut off, ſo much as the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of it,</hi> &amp;c. and you ſeem to expreſs your ſelf to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I returned him this Anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi> There muſt be ſo much Bread and Wine in the Sacrament of the Lord's-Supper, that may repreſent Chriſt's Body broken, and ſo much Wine as may in Sign as well as Signification held forth the pouring forth of Chriſt's precious Blood, or elſe the End of Chriſt is not anſwered in that Sacrament; and ſo likewiſe muſt the Burial and Reſurrection of Chriſt be in Sign, as well as our Death to Sin and riſing again to New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life is repreſented in holy Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>Should the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in Circumciſion only have cut off a little bit of the Fore-skin of the Fleſh, and not round quite off, or only have paired off the Nails of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Fingers with a little Skin with it, would that have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Mind of God in that <hi>Rite,</hi> or they have been born with in pleading it might as well anſwer Circumciſion in Signification? But the Vanity and Sinfulneſs of this Aſſertion of Mr. <hi>Burkitt</hi>'s and yours will yet be now further laid open in this Chapter; only there is one thing before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on that I ſhall add a word or two unto, as touching what you ſay concerning thoſe Waſhings that were uſed under the Law, which are called Baptiſms, which you ſay were done by ſprinkling, which is not true; we utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny any of thoſe Waſhings which are called Baptiſms were either ſprinkling or pouring of Water on them, but total dipping of their whole Body. And ſo the Reverend Mr. <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> a Man very Learned in all Jewiſh Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, affirms, on <hi>Levit.</hi> 11. 31. ſee his <hi>Annotat.</hi> on that Text, theſe are his words, <hi>viz. All that are unclean, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men or Veſſels, are not cleanſed but by dipping or baptizing in Water; and whereſoever the Law ſpeaketh of waſhing a Man's Fleſh, or waſhing of Clothes for Uncleanneſs, it is not but by dipping the whole Body therein. And whether they be Men or Veſſels, there may not be any thing between them and the Water to keep them aſunder, as Clay, Pitch, or the like that cleaveth to the Body or Veſſel; if there be, then,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65865:31"/>
are unclean, and their waſhing profiteth them not.</hi> He cites for this <hi>Maim Mikvaoeh,</hi> c. 1. §. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> what is become of your ſprinkling of <hi>Cups, Pots</hi> and <hi>Brazen Veſſels</hi> among the Jews, when 'tis ſaid they waſhed or baptized them? it appears their way in waſhing was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal dipping, or elſe they were not clean. And now to proceed to prove Chriſt's Baptiſm in Water is by Immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by Dipping, to repreſent in Sign his Death, Burial and Reſurrection, and in Signification to hold forth our Death unto Sin and riſing again to walk in Newneſs of Life who are baptized, I ſhall add it in this place,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>From the Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>By the Conſent; Agreement and Arguments of a Cloud of Witneſſes, both Antient Fathers</hi> and <hi>Modern Divines,</hi> and worthy <hi>Proteſtant Writers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt Scripture is, <hi>Rom. 6. 3, 4, 5, 6. Therefore we are buried with him in Baptiſm,</hi> &amp;c. The Saints or whole Church of the Romans were to reckon themſelves dead to Sin, and bound to live no longer therein, and that becauſe by Baptiſm (as in a lively Figure) they held forth the ſame thing; ſo that it appears Baptiſm hath a twofold Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) There is in it, when truly and rightly adminiſtred, not only a Repreſentation of Chriſt's Burial and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Alſo it ſignifies our Death unto Sin, and our riſing again to walk in Newneſs of Life; and indeed the Apoſtle makes uſe of this as an Argument to preſs Newneſs of Life (the thing ſignified in Baptiſm) upon them all, <hi>as if he ſhould ſay,</hi> As many of us as are baptized muſt know this, that we are baptized into Chriſt's Death, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt die to Sin and live a new Life: But we have all been baptized, or buried with him in Baptiſm, therefore muſt all of us die to Sin and live a new Life.</p>
            <p>Our late Annotators on the place ſay thus, He ſeems to allude to the manner of baptizing in thoſe warm Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which was, ſay they, to dip or plunge the Party baptized, and as it were to bury him for a while under Water. <hi>Cajetan</hi> upon the ſame Text ſays, <q>We are buried with Chriſt by Baptiſm unto Death; by our burying he declares our Death by the Ceremony of Baptiſm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he (that is, the Party baptized) is put under Water; </q> and by this carries a Similitude of him that was
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65865:32"/>
buried, who was put under the Earth. Now becauſe none are buried but dead Men, from this very thing that we are buried in Baptiſm, we are aſſimilated to Chriſt buried, or when he was buried.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tilenus,</hi> a great <hi>Proteſtant Writer,</hi> ſpeaks fully in this caſe: <q>Baptiſm, ſaith he, is the firſt Sacrament of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament inſtituted by Chriſt, in which there is an exact Analogy between the Sign and the Thing ſignified. The outward Rite in Baptiſm is threefold.</q>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Immerſion into the Water.</item>
               <item>2. Aciding under the Water.</item>
               <item>3. A Reſurrection out of the Water.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The Form of Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> External and Eſſential, is no other than an Analogical Proportion, which the Signs keep with the Thing ſignified thereby: For the Property of the Water waſhing away the Defilements of the Body, does in a moſt ſutable Similitude, ſet forth the Efficacy of Chriſt's Blood in blotting out of Sin; ſo dipping into the Water, in a moſt lively Similitude ſets forth the Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the old Man, and riſing out of the Water the Vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the new Man: The ſame plunging into the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſaith he, holds forth to us that horrible Gulph of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice, in which Chriſt, for our ſakes, for a while was in a manner ſwallowed up; abiding under the Water, (how little time ſoever) denotes his Deſcent into Hell, even the very deepeſt of Lifeleſneſs, lying in the ſealed or guarded Sepulchre, where he was accounted as one dead. Riſing out of the VVater, holds forth to us a lively Similitude of that Conqueſt which this dead Man got over Death. In like manner, ſaith he, 'tis therefore meet that we being baptized into his Death, and buried with him, ſhould riſe alſo with him, to go on in a new Life. Thus far</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:65865:32"/>
And let all thinking and ſerious Chriſtians carefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, ſince this ſacred Ordinance was appointed to be thus ſignificant, as this and other Learned Men obſerve, what a ſad and lamentable thing it is, that the true Baptiſm ſhould be changed from dipping into ſprinkling, which neither doth nor can hold forth theſe great Myſteries, for which purpoſe our Saviour ordained it: For 'tis evident <hi>Rantiſm</hi> or Sprinkling doth not bear any Proportion to theſe Myſteries, nor can they be ſignified thereby. What Figure of a Burial of Chriſt, or of the old Man is there in ſprinkling a few drops of VVater on a Perſon's Face? Or what Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is there in that Act of a Reſurrection? O, how is Chriſt's holy Baptiſm abuſed by this deviſed <hi>Rantiſm,</hi> and the Signification thereof deſtroyed! the Lord open your Eyes, or the Eyes of my godly and impartial Reader. This ſhews you clearly what Chriſt's true Baptiſm is, as alſo the true Subject. But to proceed.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, VVater is that wherein the Body is plunged, to waſh away all Sins; there all Sins, ſaith he, are buried. We ſuppoſe he means 'tis a Sign of this, <hi>i. e.</hi> that all Sin is buried.</p>
            <p>Moreover <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith, that the Old Man is buried and drown'd in the Immerſion under Water; and when the baptized Perſon is afterwards raiſed up out of the Water, it repreſents the Reſurrection of the New Man to New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life; and therefore concludes the contrary Cuſtom, being not only againſt Eccleſiaſtical Law, but againſt the Analogy and Myſtical Signification of the Sacrament, is not to be complied with.</p>
            <p>It has been too long, as I have formerly noted, God grant Men more Light to ſee their Error, and abhor to do ſo any more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kecker</hi> ſays, <q>That Immerſion, not Aſperſion, was the firſt Inſtitution of Baptiſm, as it doth, ſaith he, plainly appear from <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3.</q> And ſay I, VVhere hath Chriſt ſince the firſt Inſtitution, inſtituted Aſperſion, or Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the ſtead or room of Immerſion or Dipping; or given Orders to change that ſignificant Sign into the inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Foppery of Sprinkling? Ought not we to keep the Ordinances as they were firſt inſtituted and given to the Saints? Is not God's Word to be our Rule in all Points of Faith and Practice to the End of the World? Has Chriſt given any Men or Church a Diſpenſation to change his Laws
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65865:33"/>
and Ordinances, or make them void by theſe Traditions, or ſet up their Poſt by his Poſt?</p>
            <p>How doth God complain by the Prophets againſt his People of old, for preſuming to change his Laws, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 13? God gave particular Command to make an Altar of Gold to offer Incenſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. 5. and he commanded, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 24, 25. that his Altar ſhould be made of Earth or rough Stone: but in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 3. he reproves their horrid Tranſgreſſions and Diſobedience, in acting contrary to his expreſs Inſtitution. <hi>A People</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>that provoketh me to Anger continually to my Face, that ſacrificeth in Gardens, and burneth Incenſe upon Altars of Brick.</hi> You may think that was no great Error, inſtead of Gold or Stone, to make Altars of Brick: but what ſaith God? they for this, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> provoke me continually to my Face.

            <p>3. I thought the Sacrament of the Lord's-Supper had been inſtituted by Chriſt, to ſignify the Effuſion, or pouring forth his precious Blood, and not Baptiſm. VVill you confound the Uſe and End of one Sacrament with the other, to maintain your own Innovation and Abuſe of Chriſt's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Baptiſm?</p>
            <p>4. Might not the Jews, who inſtead of making Altars of Gold or Stone, made them Altars of Brick, ſay, that Altars of Brick might ſerve as well to anſwer the Uſe and End of burning Incenſe? Nay, may be they might ſay, they had not the other to do it, and therefore built their Altars of Brick: But would this Pretence do? No, no, what ſaith the Almighty God? <hi>They provoke me continually to my Face.</hi> Alſo might not others argue thus about the Sacrament of the Supper, <hi>viz.</hi> VVhat need we have VVine? If we uſe Mum or ſome other Red Liquor, inſtead of the Fruit of the Grape, it will anſwer the Uſe and End of that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as well as VVine.

            <p>5. VVe utterly deny that Baptiſm was ordain'd or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Chriſt to ſignify either the pouring forth of his Blood, or the pouring forth of the holy Spirit, and muſt tell you, that you affirm what you pleaſe, without any Proof from God's VVord. But by the way, let the Reader obſerve how you go from ſprinkling to pouring VVater on the Face of Infants. I queſtion whether you ever do ſo or not; but if you ſhould, that would be no more Chriſt's Baptiſm than ſprinkling.</p>

You are not to deviſe new Signs or Symbols of Spiritual Myſteries, of which God ſpeaks nothing in his VVord, nor ever inſtituted to ſuch Ends. I affirm he has appointed no Rite or Ordinance in the Goſpel to repreſent the ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or pouring forth of the holy Spirit. The Papiſts have (you know) ſeven Sacraments, and they tell us of the Uſe and End of them, and how wonderfully ſignificant they are, and yet all the Uſe and Signification of them were the Contrivances of their own wicked Hearts: And I muſt tell you that they prove what they do and ſay for their Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as well as you do. As to what you ſpeak of pouring or ſprinkling, take what <hi>Tho.

            <p>Chriſt hath ordained Baptiſm to be a Sign, Symbol, or lively Repreſentation of his own Death, Burial and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as I have proved and confirmed by a Cloud of Witneſſes. Will God endure or ſuffer Men (think you) to invent out of their own Brains, new Signs and Symbols of Divine Goſpel-Myſteries, and then father them upon him, and call them his Ordinances? Nay, more, be ſo bold as to ſay, theſe are more uſeful, and anſwer better the End of God, than thoſe which he himſelf inſtituted? For thus you and other Pedo-baptiſts ſpeak of Sprinkling, <hi>viz.</hi> 'tis not only lawful, but more expedient than Dipping. And hereby you ſeem to teach God Wiſdom, or to magnify yours above his.

The thing (ſaith he) is ſo apparent, as not to need any Teſtimonies; but becauſe there are not a few who do not vulgarly teach this Doctrine, it will not be ſuperfluous to produce ſome of thoſe innumerable Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, that I may (ſaith he) not ſeem to ſpeak without Book. And,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Let us begin with St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 6. 3. Know ye not, that ſo many of you that have been baptized into Chriſt, were baptized into his Death? Therefore we are buried with him in Baptiſm into his Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Elſe what ſhall they do that are baptized for the Dead,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65865:35"/>
if the Dead riſe not? <hi>As if he had ſaid,</hi> If there be no Reſurrection, why are we baptized? In vain does the Church uſe the Symbol of Baptiſm, if there be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. The like Teſtimonies frequently occur among the Fathers (ſaith he).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſaith, That believing in his Death, we may be made Partakers of his Reſurrection by Baptiſm. Baptiſm was given in Memory of the Death of our Lord, we perform the Symbols of his Death [mark] not of pouring forth his Blood, or holy Spirit, or ſprinkling the Spirit on us, or the Blood of Chriſt: No, no, this, that Author ſays, is not ſignified in Baptiſm, but the Burial and Reſurrection of Chriſt, which ſprinkling no manner of ways can repreſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſaith, We know but one ſaving Baptiſm, in regard there is but one Reſurrection from the dead, of which Baptiſm is an Image.</p>
            </q>
            <p>And from hence, ſay I, we know not Infants Rantiſm or Sprinkling, for this is none of Chriſt's true Baptiſm. Chriſt's Baptiſm is but one, and 'tis that of Believers, and 'tis not ſprinkling but dipping, to ſignify Chriſt's Burial and Reſurrection. He goes on and cites other Authors.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Hear <hi>Paul</hi> exclaiming, They paſt through the Sea, and were all baptized in the Cloud and in the Sea.</p>
               <p>He calls Baptiſm the Paſſage of the Sea, for it was a flight of Death cauſed by Water.</p>
               <p>To be baptized, and ſo plunged, and to return up and riſe out of the Water, is a Symbol of the Deſcent into the Grave, and returning from thence.</p>
               <p>Baptiſm is a Pledg and Repreſentation of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: Baptiſm is an Earneſt of the Reſurrection: Immerſion is a Repreſentation of Death and Burial. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable are the Teſtimonies (ſaith Sir <hi>Norton)</hi> which might be added, but theſe I think ſufficient to prove, that Baptiſm is an Image of the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt (from whence we acknowledg the Myſtery of our Religion, ſaith he, Chriſt's Deity and Humanity) and of the Faithful, who are baptized in his Faith, from Death in Sin to Newneſs of Life, which if they lead in this World, they have a moſt aſſured Hope, that being dead, they ſhall hereafter riſe to Glory with Chriſt.</p>

Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith, The dipping of the Body ſignifies Mortification, or Fellowſhip with Chriſt in his Death; the ſtaying under the Water ſignifies the Burial of Sin, and coming out of the Water, the Reſurrection from Sin to Newneſs of Life. In another Treatiſe of his, he ſaith, the antient Cuſtom of baptizing, was to dip, as it were to dive all the Body of the baptized in Water; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.

            <p>And here let me add what Reverend Dr. <hi>Sharp</hi> (the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Archbiſhop of <hi>York)</hi> hath lately delivered in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon preached before the Queen's Majeſty on Eaſter-day, <hi>March</hi> the <hi>27th,</hi> 1692. </p>
            <q>
               <p>And this in antient Times was taught every Chriſtian (ſaith he) in and by his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: Whenever a Perſon was baptized, he was not only to profeſs his Faith in Chriſt's Death and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but he was alſo to look upon himſelf as obliged in Correſpondence therewith, to mortify his former carnal Affections, and to enter upon a new State of Life.</p>
               <p>And the very form of Baptiſm (ſaith he) did lively repreſent this Obligation to them: For what did their being plung'd under Water ſignify, but their undertaking in Imitation of Chriſt's Death and Burial, to forſake all their former evil Courſes? as their aſcending out of the Water did their Engagement to lead a holy, ſpiritual Life. This our Apoſtle doth more than once declare to us: thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4. We are buried (ſaith he) with Chriſt by Baptiſm unto Death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up by the Glory of the Father, ſo we ſhould walk in Newneſs of Life.</p>

            <p>And unto theſe, let me add what the Pious and Reverend Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> (late Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury)</hi> hath wrote; ſpeaking of the ſame Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4. <q>Antiently, ſaith he, thoſe who were baptized put off their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which ſignified their putting off the Body of Sin, and were immerſed and buried in the Water, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Death of Sin; and then did riſe up again out of the Water to ſignify their Entrance upon a new Life. And to theſe Cuſtoms the Apoſtle alludes, when he ſays, <hi>How ſhall we that are dead to Sin, live any longer therein? Know ye not that ſo many of us as were baptized into Jeſus Chriſt, were baptized into his Death?</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis a hard caſe, you neither will believe the holy Scripture, the Antient Fathers and Modern Divines, nor other learned Prelates of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who are yet living; but, contrary to the nature and tendency of holy Baptiſm, plead for Sprinkling and condemn Dipping, and caſt Reproach upon it, and ſay alſo, that the Thing ſignified thereby, is <hi>the pouring forth of Chriſt's Blood,</hi> or <hi>the ſprinkling and pouring out of the holy Spirit,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we prove from the Scripture, and with the Teſtimony of all theſe great Men, that Baptiſm ſignifies the Death, Burial and Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, and not any of thoſe things you affirm as your own Conceit, without the Teſtimony of any learned or approved Author.</p>
            <p>Therefore, Sir, that Baptiſm is any thing elſe than dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, plunging or waſhing, which is done by dipping, we do utterly deny: For as the cutting off a little bit of the Foreskin of the Fleſh, or not the twentieth part round, is not Circumciſion; ſo ſprinkling a little Water on the Face is not Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>True, you call it Baptiſm, and will do ſo, tho 'tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs nor more than Rantiſm, 'tis, not the Thing, nor <hi>does it anſwer in Signification.</hi> I may tell you again, that the Jews inſtead of circumciſing the Foreskin of their Childrens Fleſh, might have as well preſumed to diſpense with that, and only have paired off the Nails of the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of their Male Infants, and have called that Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as you may call ſprinkling or pouring a little Water, Baptiſm. But may be you'l ſay, in Circumciſion they we<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

of their Childrens Fingers; nay, and they might better plead, that the Things ſignified in Circumciſion, might be as well anſwered in that new Device (the Nails being a ſort of Excrement they might ſay ſignified the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Filth of Sin, or Corruption of Nature) as the great Myſteries ſignified by Baptiſm or Dipping, can be repreſented by ſprinkling or pouring.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, they might poſſibly plead the ſame Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences you do, <hi>viz. The cutting off the Foreskin of the Fleſh</hi> put the Infants to great Pain; nay, may be they might fancy it would coſt them their Lives; nay, call it Murder, and therefore let pairing of their Nails ſerve: As you it ſeems fear dipping would endanger the Lives of Infants, and therefore make ſprinkling to ſerve inſtead thereof. But to proceed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I am in amaze to ſee theſe Men ſpeak ſo fully and clearly to this glorious Truth, <hi>(i. e.</hi> that the great thing Chriſt ordained Baptiſm to repreſent, is his Death, Burial and Reſurrection, together with the baptized Perſon's Death to Sin, and his riſing again to walk in Newneſs of Life) and yet both thoſe ſhameful Abuſes amongſt you and other Churches are not rectified, <hi>viz.</hi>

the Subjects thereof, becauſe in them appears no ſuch Death to Sin, nor can they be ſaid to come out of that watery Grave as new born Creatures. To theſe Teſtimonies I ſhall only add one or two more.</p>
            <p>See that moſt learned <hi>Anonymous</hi> French Writer, in his Anſwer to the <hi>famous Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Meaux;</hi> 
               <q>'Tis moſt certain (ſaith he) that Baptiſm hath not hitherto been admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred otherwiſe than by ſprinkling, by the moſt of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants;</hi> but truly this ſprinkling is an Abuſe. This Cuſtom, which, without an accurate Examination they have retained from the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> in like manner as many other things, makes their Baptiſm very defective. It corrupteth its Inſtitution and antient Uſe, and that Nearneſs of Similitude which is needful ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt it and Faith, Repentance and Regeneration. This Reflection of Mr. <hi>Boſſuet</hi> deſerveth to be ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, to wit (ſaith he) that this uſe of plunging hath continued for the ſpace of a whole thouſand and three hundred Years: Hence we may underſtand that we did not carefully, as it was meet, examine things which we have received from the Roman Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, <q>That Baptiſm is a form or way of Burial; and none but ſuch as are already dead to Sin, or have repented from dead Works, are to be buried.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe words I note;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Sprinkling is not the form of Baptiſm, becauſe not the form of a Burial.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Infants are not the true Subjects of Baptiſm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not ſuch as are already dead to Sin, or have repented from dead Works; and indeed as they are not able, they are not required ſo to do by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The laſt Author I ſhall quote is learned <hi>Zanchy,</hi> 
               <q>There are two Parts, ſaith he, in Regeneration, Mortification and Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ification; that is called a Burial with Chriſt, this (is called) a Reſurrection with Chriſt. The Sacrament of both theſe is Baptiſm in which we are overwhelmed, or buried, and after that do come forth and riſe again. It may not be ſaid truly, but ſacramentally of all that are baptized, that they are buried with Chriſt, and raiſed with him, but only of ſuch as have true Faith.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now we may appeal to all the World, whether <hi>Zanchy</hi> and all the reſt do not clearly and evidently teſtify the ſame thing that we aſſert, <hi>viz.</hi> That Baptiſm is and can be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65865:38"/>
no other Act than Immerſion or Dipping, ſince Sprinkling, all muſt confeſs, doth not repreſent in a lively Figure, the Burial and Reſurrection of Chriſt, nor our dying or being dead to Sin, and Vivification to Newneſs of Life, ſaith he, Sacramentally, <hi>i. e.</hi> Analogically, in reſpect of the near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance between Baptiſm, and a Death and Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>And this, I ſay, cannot be ſaid of them that are ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led only; for if, in reſpect of Mortification and Vivifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, they may be denominated buried and raiſed with Chriſt, (which cannot be ſaid of Infants) yet that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Rite or Sign cannot denominate them ſo much as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally buried and raiſed with Chriſt: for there is not ſo much as any likeneſs of ſuch things in it; but in true Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> total dipping the Body in Water, and raiſing it again, there is a lively Figure held forth to our very ſight. And as <hi>Zanchy</hi> ſaith, <q>It cannot be ſaid of all, nor indeed of any, that they are thus ſacramentally dead, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and riſen with Chriſt, but only of ſuch as have true Faith. Therefore Infants are excluded by his own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What you ſay, <hi>that none plant Bodies in Water by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them,</hi> ſeems ſtrange, and not the words of a learned Man; becauſe dipping is a Figure of planting us into Chriſt ſpiritually, and of Chriſt's Death and Reſurrection, muſt the Body of a Man be a Tree? None graft Bodies into a Vine, yet the grafting of a Perſon into Chriſt is repreſented by that Alluſion, or <hi>Metaphorical Expreſſion:</hi> Muſt the Sign and the Thing ſignified be all one and the ſame thing?</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee, in oppoſition to what you ſay, in the cloſe of your third Chapter, that it is very plain and manifeſt, that dipping is abſolutely neceſſary, and of the Eſſence of Baptiſm, it's <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Alas, Sir, in all the New Teſtament where we read of ſprinkling, the Greek (as I ſaid before) renders it <hi>rantizing,</hi> not baptizing: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Chriſt has ordained Rantiſm, to repreſent the ſprinkling of his Blood, or the ſprinkling of his Spirit, prove it; we deny it, and have ſufficiently proved he has appointed Baptiſm to repreſent his Death, Burial and Reſurrection, and that ſprinkling is not baptizing. But for a farther Satisfaction of the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reader take a few Syllogiſtical Arguments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. If Baptiſm was ordained to repreſent the <hi>Death, Burial</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Chriſt in a lively Figure; then Sprinkling cannot be Chriſt's true Baptiſm: But Baptiſm
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65865:38"/>
was ordained to repreſent the Death, Burial and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt in a lively Figure; therefore Sprinkling cannot be Chriſt's true Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>This Argument we have proved to be true in every part of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If Baptiſm was appointed to hold forth or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent in a lively Figure the Perſon's Death to Sin who is baptized, or his preſent Regeneration, not future, and his riſing again to walk in Newneſs of Life; then Infants can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Subjects thereof. But Baptiſm was appointed to hold forth, or repreſent in a lively Figure the Perſon's Death to Sin who is baptized, or his preſent Regeneration, not future, and his riſing again to walk in Newneſs of Life: Therefore Infants are not the Subjects thereof.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is yet one Proof further to make it yet clearer, that Baptiſm is dipping or plunging, and nothing elſe, and that is taken from thoſe Typical Baptiſms ſpoken of in the holy Scripture.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That of the Red Sea, wherein the Fathers were buried as it were unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Sea, and under the Cloud. See <hi>Pool</hi>'s Annotations on the Place.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Others, ſays he, (more properly) think the Apoſtle uſes this Term in regard of the great Analogy betwixt Baptiſm (as it was uſed) the Perſon going down into the Waters, and being dipped in them, and the Iſraelites going down into the Sea, the great Receptable of Water; tho the Water at that time was gathered on heaps on the other ſide of them, yet they ſeemed buried in the Water, as Perſons ſeem'd buried in the Water were in that Age when they were baptized.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The ſecond Typical Baptiſm was that of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark: See Sir <hi>Norton Knatchbull,</hi> whom I quoted before, ſaith he, <q>
                  <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark and Baptiſm were both a Type and Figure of the Reſurrection, not a Sign of the waſhing away of Sin, tho ſo taken metonymically, but a particular Signal of the Reſurrection of Chriſt. Of this again, ſaith he, is Baptiſm a lively and emphatical Figure, as alſo was the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> out of which he returned, as from a Sepulchre.</q> From hence I infer this Argument following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. If thoſe Typical Baptiſms ſpoken of in the Scriptures, ſignified Immerſion, or an Overwhelming, or a Burial; then is Sprinkling no true Baptiſm: But thoſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65865:39"/>
Typical Baptiſms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did ſignify Immerſion, or an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming, or a Burial; Therefore Sprinkling is no true Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>Again, that Baptiſm is dipping or plunging, or a being buried in the Water, appears by thoſe Metaphorical Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms we read of, which are twofold.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> The Baptiſm of the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> The Baptiſm of Afflictions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> Saith <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>I indeed baptize you with Water, but he ſhall baptize you with the holy Spirit and Fire.</hi> Now 'tis not the ſanctifying Gifts of the Spirit which every Godly Perſon receives, that is the Baptiſm of the Spirit; but, as the Learned obſerve, the miraculous Effuſions of the holy Spirit, like that at Pentecoſt, <hi>Acts 1. 4, 5. ſhall be baptized.</hi> 
               <q>The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſaith <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> is to dip or plunge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which Senſe, ſaith he, the Apoſtles might be truly ſaid to have been baptized; for the Houſe in which this was done was filled with the Holy Ghoſt. So that the Apoſtles might ſeem to have been plunged into it, as in a large Fiſh-pond.</q> 'Tis not a ſprinkling of the Spirit that is the Baptiſm of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: for ſo doubtleſs the Apoſtles had the Spirit before they were ſaid to be baptized with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oecumenius</hi> on <hi>Acts</hi> 2. ſaith, <q>A Wind filled the whole Houſe that it ſeem'd like a Fiſh-pond, becauſe it was promiſed to the Apoſtles, that they ſhould be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> We read of the Baptiſm of Afflictions. I have a Baptiſm to be baptized with, and how am I ſtrai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, immergo,</hi> as I ſhewed before, to plunge under, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm, great Afflictions come to be called Baptiſm, and ſignifies, as <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſhews, not every light Affliction, but like that of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 32. 6. he drew me out of the deep Waters. Hence great Afflictions are called Waves; <hi>Thy Wazes and thy Billows are gone over me,</hi> Pſal. 42. 7. 'Tis ſpoken of Chriſt's Sufferings, who was as it were drowned, drenched, or overwhelmed in Afflictions and Sufferings: Every ſmall Affliction is not the Baptiſm of Afflictions, but great and deep Afflictions, ſuffering even unto Blood and Death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pool</hi>'s Annotations ſay, to be baptized is to be dipped in Water, metaphorically to be plunged in Afflictions.</p>
            <p>

I ſhall cloſe this alſo with another Argument.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. If thoſe <hi>Metaphorical Baptiſms</hi> which we read of in God's Word (as the Baptiſm of the Spirit, and of Afflictions and Sufferings) are taken from the literal and genuine Signification of the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Sir, I ſhall examine all your Grounds, and anſwer each of your Argumenrs in order: And firſt of all, that of the Covenant with <hi>Abraham.</hi> You argue thus, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed were under the Covenant of Grace, we the Gentiles are a Seed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Covenant of Grace belongeth as extenſively unto us as it did to <hi>Abraham,</hi> even to us and to our Children; and if the Children of the Faithful are in the Covenant of Grace, can any Man forbid them the Seal of the Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer, 'tis well, you cannot deny that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm belongs to the Faithful, <hi>viz.</hi> to Believers; we then are right who baptize ſuch: and if Faith both in order of Words, and in order of Practice in the Apoſtolical Days, preceded Baptiſm, then none but Believers ought to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; but, by your own Confeſſion, Faith both in order of Words and Practice in the Apoſtolical Days did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede Baptiſm; 'tis not he that is baptized, and afterwards believes, but contrary ways, he that believeth and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. Faith is required as prerequiſite to Baptiſm, in all that Chriſt enjoins Baptiſm upon, which Infants are not capable of.</p>
            <p>2. As to your firſt Argument for Believers Seed to be baptized, from the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> I ſhall ſhew it is invalid, and will do you no Service.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe there was a twofold Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> one with his Natural Seed, as ſuch, the other with his true Spiritual, as ſuch: So that what you ſay that <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed were in the Covenant of Grace, <hi>viz.</hi> his Spiritual Seed, is not denied by us; but that all his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural were in the Covenant of Grace the Apoſtle denies, and ſhews the contrary, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>Now if I prove there were two Covenants made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> what is become of all you have ſaid in reſpect of this matter? And that it is ſo, let what followeth be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:65865:40"/>
1. We affirm, that the Covenant of Grace and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Circumciſion made with <hi>Abraham</hi> is not the ſame or one intire Covenant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ſhall conſider whether there be the ſame reaſon of Circumciſion and of Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> We ſay there was a Covenant of Grace, or Goſpel-Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all Believers in him, or all his true Spiritual Seed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> But the Covenant of Circumciſion, or that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant God made with his Natural Seed, as ſuch, was a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Covenant from the Covenant of Grace; theſe two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants were ſignified to <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſhews in plain words, <hi>Gal. 4. 24. Which things are an Allegory; for theſe are the two Covenants,</hi> &amp;c. And now fully and plainly to prove this great Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that there were two Covenants made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> take this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> If the Covenants take their Denomination from the Promiſes, and the Promiſes are diſtinct, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, belonging to thoſe that the Goſpel belongs unto; and others Domeſtick or Civil Promiſes, eſpecially and abſolutely reſpecting the Houſe, and Natural Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and Policy of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> then there were two Covenants made with <hi>Abraham:</hi> but this is ſo; <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. To make it clear, and prove it, it is evident that that Promiſe was Evangelical, belonging to the Goſpel-Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17. 5. <hi>I have made thee a Father of many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> And ſo is that Promiſe, <hi>Gen. 15. 5. So ſhall thy Seed be:</hi> in which it is promiſed that there ſhall be of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions many, or a great number, that ſhall be <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Spiritual Children by believing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 17, 18. Alſo it was Evangelical, which we find in <hi>Gen. 12. 3. And in thy Seed ſhall all the Kindreds of the Earth be bleſſed.</hi> Theſe 'tis evident reſpect all Goſpel-Believers, who are the Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> See <hi>Gal. 3. 8. And the Scripture foreſeeing that God would juſtify the Heathen through Faith, preached the Goſpel to</hi> Abraham, <hi>ſaying, In thee ſhall All the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed.</hi> And more directly to Chriſt, who is the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Gal. 3. 16. Now to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his Seed were the Promiſes made: He ſaith not, And to Seeds, as of many, but as of one, and to thy Seed, which is Chriſt;</hi> that is, to Chriſt as the Head and Surety of the Covenant of Grace; and ſo primarily and directly to him, and then in

him to all who are his, according to that <hi>Gal. 3. 29. And if you be Chriſt's, then are ye</hi> Abraham's <hi>Seed, and Heirs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Promiſe.</hi> See alſo <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 25.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Moreover, that the Domeſtick and Civil Promiſes were many, is plain: As, 1. Of multiplying the Seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> 2. The Birth of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> 3.

               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. All they that are in that Goſpel Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> or who are his true Spiritual Seed,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65865:42"/>
have the Promiſe of Everlaſting Life made ſure to them: But all the Infant-Seed of Believers, as ſuch, have not the Promiſe of Everlaſting Life made ſure to them; <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Infant-Seed of Believers, as ſuch, are not in that Goſpel-Covenant God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor his true Spiritual Seed. Take another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. If all the true Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> have the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and walk in the ſteps of <hi>Abraham,</hi> even that Faith <hi>Abraham</hi> had before he was circumciſed; then the Infant-Seed of Believers, as ſuch, are not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the true Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> have the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and walk in the ſteps of <hi>Abraham,</hi> even that Faith <hi>Abraham</hi> had before he was circumciſed: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Infant-Seed of Believers, as ſuch, are not the true Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Major,</hi> ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11, 12.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> cannot be denied: No Man in his right Wits will affirm, the Infants of Believers, as ſuch, have the Faith <hi>Abraham</hi> had before he was circumciſed; nor do many of them; nor can they walk in the ſteps of <hi>Abraham,</hi> having not his Faith.</p>
            <p>If any object and ſay, If Infants of Believers are not included in that Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> how can any of them who die in their Infancy be ſaved?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, 1. Cannot God ſave dying Infants unleſs they were included in the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham?</hi> How then could the dying Infants of the Godly, who lived before that Covenant was made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> be ſaved?</p>
            <p>God has many ways, through Chriſt's Undertakings, to ſave dying Infants, as Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> notes, which we know not of: Secret things belong to God, and revealed things to us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Were they in any ſenſe included in that Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> tho not accounted for his Natural or Spiritual Seed, yet it would not follow from thence that they ought to be baptized; becauſe the Females who were truly <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Natural Seed, and ſome of them might be his Spiritual Seed too, yet were not circumciſed, no more than the Male Children of the Godly were before <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Were they in Covenant as they are the Natural Seed of Believers? Then Baptiſm however does not bring them into the Covenant; and if ſo, their State is good, whether
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65865:42"/>
baptized or no: And if Baptiſm brings them into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and makes the Covenant ſure unto them, then it would follow that 'tis in the Power of Men, either to bring their Children into the Covenant of Grace, or keep them out; and that it is in effect to ſay, Parents have Power to ſave or deſtroy their Children: and how abſurd that is, I will leave to all impartial Men to judg.</p>
            <p>I ſhall, in the next place, prove, that the Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was not a Covenant of Grace, or Faith, and therefore doth not concern the Infant-Seed of believing Gentiles.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I argue thus: That Covenant that was made to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> from all other Nations of the World, and made ſure unto them the Earthly Promiſe of the Poſſeſſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> could not be a Covenant of Grace, which concerns the Infant-Seed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers under the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>But the Covenant of Circumciſion was made to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> from all other Nations of the World, and made ſure unto them the Earthly Promiſe of the Poſſeſſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan: Ergo,</hi> The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Circumciſion could not be a Covenant of Grace, which concerns the Infants of Believers under the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> cannot be denied, becauſe the Goſpel, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Covenant is eſtabliſh'd upon no ſuch Earthly Promiſes as the Covenant of Circumciſion was, not that we ſhould have an Earthly Kingdom, or poſſeſs the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> but it is eſtabliſhed on better Promiſes than theſe, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. Alſo if that Covenant concern'd us, or our Children, who are Gentiles, then the Gentiles had equal Right to that Earthly Inheritance; and then were not the Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſeparated from all other People upon the account of that Earthly Bleſſing as their Poſſeſſion only.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Minor,</hi> ſee <hi>Gen. 17. I will eſtabliſh my Covenant between me and thee,</hi> ver. 7. <hi>And I will give unto thee, and thy Seed after thee, the Land wherein thou art a Stranger, all the Land of</hi> Canaan <hi>for an everlaſting Poſſeſſion; and I will be thy God,</hi> ver. 8. <hi>This is my Covenant, which ye ſhall keep between me and you, and thy Seed after thee; every Man-Child among you ſhall be circumciſed,</hi> ver. 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> There were ſome who were circumciſed, to whom the Promiſe of the Goſpel-Covenant God made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> did not belong, as <hi>Iſhmael, Eſau,</hi> &amp;c. God expreſly
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65865:43"/>
ſaid, that his Covenant <hi>(i. e.</hi> the Covenant of Grace) was not eſtabliſh'd with <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> but with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and yet the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Circumciſion belonged to <hi>Iſhmael</hi> as well as to <hi>Iſaac.</hi> See <hi>Gen. 17. 20, 21. As for</hi> Iſhmael, <hi>I have heard thee: behold.

Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this with <hi>Rom. 7. 8, 9. Not becauſe they are the Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>are they all Children:</hi> that is, Children of the Covenant of Grace, or the Children of God; <hi>but the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Promiſe are co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Moreover, there were other Perſons in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Houſe, who no doubt might ſome of them be in the Covenant of Grace, and had the Promiſes belonging to them, who were nevertheleſs not circumciſed, namely, the Females; alſo Male-Infants dying before the eighth day coming from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> Moreover, other Godly Men who were not of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Family, yet lived in his time, as <hi>Melchiſedec, Lot, Job</hi> &amp;c. none of theſe had right to be circumciſed. But if any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and ſay, the Females were circumciſed in the Males: I anſwer with Mr. <hi>Tombs,</hi> it is without Proof; and by like, nay perhaps greater Reaſon it may be ſaid, that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Believers are baptized in the Perſons of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and therefore are not to be baptized in their own Perſons. Alſo 'tis apparent that the Jews comprehended in that Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and circumciſed accordingly, were nevertheleſs not admitted to Baptiſm upon that root of account; which, had the Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion been a Goſpel-Covenant, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the ſame nature, I ſee no Reaſon why <hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:65865:43"/>
But the Covenant of Circumciſion was made with, or did belong to the Fleſhly Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Iſhmael, Eſau,</hi> and all the Lineal Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who were ungodly, as well as to the godly: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Covenant of Cirumciſion was not a Covenant of Grace, or Goſpel-Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 4 If all who are in the Covenant of Grace, or Goſpel-Covenant, do know the Lord from the greateſt to the leaſt of them; then the Covenant of Circumciſion could not be the Covenant of Grace, or Goſpel-Covenant.</p>
            <p>But all who are in the Covenant of Grace, or Goſpel-Covenant, do know the Lord from the greateſt to the leaſt of them: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Covenant of Circumciſion was not the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>This Argument is fully proved by that in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 32; 33, 34 ſpeaking of the new Covenant which God would make with the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which ſhould not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the old, he goes on and tells us what God would do in the Goſpel-day. That he would <hi>put his Law into their inward Parts, and write it in their Hearts. And they ſhall teach no more every Man his Neighbour, and every Man his Brother, ſaying, Know the Lord; for they ſhall all know me, from the leaſt of them unto the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And indeed in this very reſpect the Goſpel-Covenant is not according to the old, as the Lord ſaid it ſhould not be, as well as in divers other caſes: For many of thoſe who were in the old Covenant (to which Circumciſion did appertain) were Infants, though all of them were not taken in by Circumciſion; for Female Infants were received into that old Covenant without it. Now theſe Children who were taken into Covenant, did not know the Lord: Infants having no Underſtanding, know not their Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand from their Left, it is therefore impoſſible they ſhould know the Lord; and therefore there was a neceſſity, after they were in that Covenant, that they ſhould be taught to know the Lord: Firſt, That God is, and what a God he is, and ſo to know him as to fear him, and ſerve him in Sincerity.</p>
            <p>But in the Goſpel-Covenant God promiſed it ſhould be otherwiſe, all who were received into that Covenant ſhould be Adult Perſons, or ſuch who did know the Lord: which plainly implies no ignorant Infant ſhould be taken into that Covenant, and be a Member of that Church-State; for it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65865:44"/>
ſo, then it would follow, ſuch would have the like need to be taught to know the Lord, as they had in the old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Church State. And remarkable it is, that this Text doth clearly intimate, that all who ſhould be taken into the Goſpel-Covenant, or Goſpel-Church, ſhould be diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled or taught, firſt to know God; for to be taught or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled is all one and the ſame thing, which agrees with Chriſt's great Commiſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. where he gave Direction: who, or what kind of Perſons they were to be that he would have his Apoſtles receive into his Goſpel-Church; and that they ſhould be all of them, firſt taught, or made Diſciples, and, as ſuch, be baptized, is clearly declared. Now that this Text in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. refers to the Goſpel-Covenant is evident. ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. That Covenant that was a part or branch of the old Covenant, or Covenant of Works, was not a Covenant of Grace, or Goſpel-Covenant.</p>
            <p>But the Covenant of Circumciſion was a part or branch of the old Covenant, or Covenant of Works; <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Covenant of Circumciſion was not a Covenant of Grace, or Goſpel-Covenant.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> cannot be denied.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is eaſily proved. That which bound or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged all thoſe who were under it, or did it, to keep the whole Law, and was alſo abrogated, or taken away by Chriſt, with all the other Rites and Shadows of the old Covenant, was a part or branch of the ſaid old Covenant. But Circumciſion bound or obliged all who were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed to keep the whole Law, and alſo the ſame Rite of Circumciſion was abrogated, with all other Rites and Shadows of the old Covenant by Chriſt: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was a part or branch of the old Covenant; ſee <hi>Gal. 5. 3. I teſtify to every Man that is circumciſed, that he is a Debtor to keep the whole Law.</hi>

            <p>But the Covenant of Circumciſion was in its nature and quality as much a Covenant of Works, as that Covenant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> or the <hi>Sinai-</hi>Covenant: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Covenant of Circumciſion was not a Covenant of Grace, or Goſpel-Covenant.

Alſo the new Covenant is ſaid to be directly contrary unto it, or not according to it, but op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed thereto, and that there was no Righteouſneſs by it, nor Life: for, as the Apoſtle ſhews, if there had, Chriſt is dead in vain; and beſides, the Apoſtle ſays 'tis done away.

            <p>
               <q>Now, ſaith he, that the Covenant of Circumciſion is of the ſame ſtamp, is evident: for tho God promiſed to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his Seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8. as he did alſo in the <hi>Sinai-</hi>Covenant to the ſame People in the Wilderneſs; yet ſtill it was on condition of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with an anſwerable Threatning in caſe of Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; <hi>Ver. 9, 10.

            <p>That which Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi> hath ſaid in his laſt Reply (in his Book, called, <hi>A ſuccinct and ſeaſonable Diſcourſe)</hi> to Mr. <hi>Cary,</hi> is mainly to prove that there is but one Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works <hi>p</hi> 217, 218, &amp;c.</p>

But to proceed; Tho we ſay there is but one Covenant of Grace, yet it is evident there were ſeveral diſtinct Miniſtrations of it, or Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to it; and we ſay, the Promiſe of the Goſpel, or Goſpel-Covenant, was the ſame in all Ages, in reſpect of things promiſed, with the nature and quality thereof, which is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65865:45"/>
and Everlaſting Life. Yet this Evangelical Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant had divers Forms or Tranſcripts of it, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thoſe things, and various Sanctions by which it was given forth and confirmed. To <hi>Adam</hi> the Promiſe was made, under the Name of the Seed of the Women bruiſing the Head of the Serpent; to <hi>Enoch, Noah,</hi> &amp;c. in other Forms; to <hi>Abraham,</hi> under the Name of his Seed, in whom all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed; to <hi>Moſes;</hi> by the Name of a great Prophet of his Brethren like unto him; and it was alſo ſignified to him under dark Shadows and Sacrifices: unto <hi>David</hi> under the Name of a Succeſſor in his Kingdom: In the New Teſtament in plain words, <hi>We all, with open face, beholding as in a Glaſs the Glory of the Lord;</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18.</p>
            <p>But now, becauſe there were ſo many Additions of the Goſpel-Promiſe and new Covenant, are there ſo many new Covenants? This being ſo, Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi> hath done nothing to remove Mr. <hi>Cary</hi>'s Arguments, but they ſtand as a Rock. Take another of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. That Covenant in which Faith was not reckoned to <hi>Abraham</hi> or Righteouſneſs, could not be a Goſpel-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or a Covenant of Grace:</p>
            <p>But the Scripture is expreſs, that Faith was not reckoned to <hi>Abraham</hi> for Righteouſneſs when he was circumciſed, but in Uncircumciſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 9, 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Covenant of Circumciſion was not a Goſpel-Covenant, or a Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 8 That Law or Covenant which is contradiſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or oppoſed to the Righteouſneſs of Faith, could not be a Covenant of Faith, or a Gospel-Covenant.</p>
            <p>But the Law or Covenant of Circumciſion is by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle plainly oppoſed to, or contradiſtinguiſhed unto the Righteouſneſs of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Law or Covenant of Circumciſion was not a Goſpel-Covenant. And from hence Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> argues thus, <q>By the way, ſaith he, let it be obſerved, in reference to the two foregoing Arguments which I have already proved, that that Covenant that is not of Faith, muſt be a Covenant of Works, there being no Medium be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, and consequently muſt be the ſame for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with that made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and that on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> with the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>

               <hi>Arg.</hi> 9. That Covenant that is plainly repreſented to us in Scripture as a Bondage-Covenant, in and by which there was impoſed ſuch a Yoke upon the Necks of the Jews, which neither thoſe in the Apoſtles time, nor their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were able to bear, could be no other than a Covenant of Works, and not of Grace.</p>
            <p>But the Scriptures do plainly repreſent ſuch was the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Covenant of Circumciſion, <hi>Acts 15. 10. Gal. 5. 1, 2, 3. Ergo,</hi> The Covenant of Circumciſion was not a Goſpel-Covenant, but a Covenant of Works. Thus Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> argues alſo: And thus we have proved from God's Word, and ſound Arguments, that the Covenant of Circumciſion was not a Goſpel-Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But leſt any ſhould think that we ſhut out all dying Infants from having any Benefit by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, I doubt not but God might comprehend them in-that glorious Covenant or Compact made between him and, our Surety in the Covenant of Redemption: But, as I ſaid before, ſecret things belong to God.</p>
            <p>But let me here add one word or two further, <hi>i. e.</hi> Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, you ſay, was a Privilege: ſo we ſay too, but not ſuch a Privilege as you do imagine.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It doth profit as a Privilege, becauſe it was given as a Token or a Sign to <hi>Abraham's</hi> Natural Seed, that they ſhould have the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for an everlaſting Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As a Token or Sign to them of the giving forth of the Law on Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> He dealt his Laws and Statutes to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he did not ſo to any other Nation; this Rite could not therefore be a Goſpel-Rite, nor the Covenant it was a Sign of a Goſpel-Covenant, in which the Gentile Chriſtians are concern'd. And thus <hi>Paul</hi> argues, <hi>Rom. 31. What Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage then hath the Jew? or what Profit is there in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion?</hi> Ver. 2. <hi>Much every way; chiefly, becauſe unto them were committed the Oracles of God.</hi> You may ſoon know the nature of that Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Natural Seed, and of Circumciſion which was a Sign of it; the chiefeſt Privilege which attended it, was the giving to them, <hi>i. e.</hi> the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Law of the Ten Commandments.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Circumciſion, by the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> was a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege if they kep: the Law: <hi>For Circumciſion verily profiteth, if thou keepeſt the Law; but if thou be a Breaker of the Law, thy Circumciſion is made Uncircumciſion,</hi> or a Nullity, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65865:46"/>
profiteth thee nothing; that is, if thou keep not the Law perfectly. And thus ſpeak our late Annotators on the place, <q>If thou [Jew] keep the Law perfectly, to which Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion obligeth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3. If otherwiſe thou tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſeſt the Law, thy Circumciſion availeth thee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, it gives thee no Privilege above the uncircumciſed.</q> What is now become (this being ſo) of that mighty Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed (as ſuch) had by Circumciſion, if the chief Profit or Privilege was, becauſe unto them the Land ſhould be given, which could not give Life, but was a Covenant of Works? then the chiefeſt Profit lay not in it, as it was an Ordinance of Initiation into the Church: ſure, had <hi>Paul</hi> been of the Judgment of Pedo-baptiſts, he would have rather paſt by that Privilege, when he ſpoke of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, which he calls the chief, and have ſaid, chiefly in that it was a Seal of Church-Memberſhip. But ſince he ſpeaks the quite contrary, who ſhall we believe, you, or the great Apoſtle of the Gentiles? And evident it is, he confirms the ſame Doctrine, <hi>Gal. 5. 3. For I teſtify to every Man that is circumciſed, that he is a Debtor to keep the whole Law.</hi> And hence 'tis ſaid to be a Yoke of Bondage which neither they nor their Fathers could bear, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. becauſe it obliged them to univerſal O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>edience, or to keep the Law perfectly, and brought them under a Curſe if they did not, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
            <p>Theſe things conſidered, fully ſhew of what ſtamp and nature Circumcition was, together with that Covenant to which it did appertain.</p>
            <p>You ſav the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> did include Spiritual Bleſſings.</p>
            <p>And I grant the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham</hi> principally included Spiritual Bleſſings; but the Covenant with his Natural Seed, as ſuch, did not include Spiritual Bleſſings: All Spiritual Bleſſings are made in Chriſt, and to none but to the Elect in him. Moreover, we deny not but the Covenant of Circumciſion was made as well with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Spiritual Seed that ſprang from his Loins, as unto his Carnal Seed; and ſo Circumciſion and the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> were of uſe to his Spiritual Seed, as the one typified the Circumciſion of the Heart, and the other the Celeſtial Reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ſay that Infants were always in the Covenant of Grace; and to proveit, you mention <hi>Act. 2 38, 39. Repent,

               </gap>o believe, or are called by the Lord? We grant it readily, but we do deny that this Promiſe here refers to our Seed as ſuch. Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> late Biſhop of <hi>Down,</hi> on this Text ſays, </p>
            <q>
               <p>And to your Children, that is, to you and to your Poſterity, to you and to your Children, when they are of the ſame Capacity in which you are, effectually receptive of the Promiſe; but <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> if whenever the word [Children] is uſed in Scripture, we ſhould by Children underſtand Infants, we muſt believe that in all <hi>Iſrael</hi> there were no Men, but all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The Promiſe appertains not to Infants in that Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and Conſiſtence, but only by the Title of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reaſonable Creatures, and when they come to act Faith, of which by Nature they have the Faculty. If it did, yet Baptiſm <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> is not the Means of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Ghoſt; for when <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, <hi>Repent and be baptized, and ye ſhall receive the holy Spirit,</hi> it ſignifies no more than this; Firſt, Be baptized, and then by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was another Myſtery and Rite, ye ſhall receive the Promiſe of the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But then, ſaith he, from hence to argue, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is a Capacity of receiving the ſame Grace, there alſo the ſame Sign is to be adminiſtred, and from hence to inſer Pedo-baptiſm, is an argument very fall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, upon ſeveral Grounds. 1. Becauſe Baptiſm is not the Sign of the Holy Ghoſt, but by another My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, it was conveyed ordinarily and extraordinarily, (that is, by laying on of Hands, as the Doctor mentioned before). 2. If the Suppoſition were true, the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion built upon it is falſe; for, ſaith he, they that were capable of the ſame Grace, are not always capable of the ſame Sign; for Women under the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> altho they were capable of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, yet they were not capable of the Sign of Circumciſion; for God doth not always convey his Grace in the ſame manner.</p>

Thus far Reverend Dr. <hi>Jer. Taylor,</hi> Lib. of Proph. <hi>p.</hi> 234, 235.</p>
            <p>For what the Biſhop hath ſaid anſwers all you affirm on this Text for Infants Baptiſm. The Promiſe of the Spirit we grant runs to Believers, and to all their believing Seed and Off-ſpring, be they Jews or Gentiles; and this Text proves nothing more. It did not belong to the Jews Seed, as ſuch, but only to their Children that did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and ſo it doth to the Gentiles, that were ſometimes afar off, that believe, and to their Children that God ſhall alſo call, as he doth call their Parents.</p>
            <p>That which you ſeem to affirm from this Text is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is ſuch a Covenant made with Gentile Believers, and with every particular Believer, and his Carnal Seed, as God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> which is ſtrange Divinity. We have proved that there was a Covenant of Peculiarity made with <hi>Abraham and his Natural Seed,</hi> to which Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion did belong, and by virtue of that Covenant, as appertaining to the Fleſh. There was under the Law a <hi>knowing of Men,</hi> the Jews in that Legal and External Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant had the <hi>Preference</hi> above the Gentiles; but that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is taken away, and that Partition Wall is pulled do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, and now the Jews have no Advantage upon that account above the Gentiles, or the Gentiles above the Jews, <hi>old things being paſſed away,</hi> and old Church State and Church-Memberſhip gone; ſo that all you ſay upon this Scripture and Argument ſignifies nothing.</p>
            <p>And remarkable 'tis that <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake theſe words to the Jews, <hi>The Promiſe is to you and your Children,</hi> &amp;c. But to ſay, the Promiſe runs to them and to their Infants, as to Baptiſm and Church-Memberſhip under the Goſpel, as Circumciſion and Legal Church-Memberſhip did under the Law, is notoriouſly faiſe; none of the Jews Children were allowed Baptiſm, or received into the Goſpel-Church, but only ſuch that did believe, nor of the Gentiles neither; when their Children believe, or are called, then they may be baptized, and they have right to the Promiſe of the holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>The Promiſe and Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> you ſay, comes on the Gentiles through Chriſt, and by Faith, therefore, ſay I, not in a fleſhly Line, and by Birth-Privilege</p>

            <p>3.

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is the ſenſe of the Apoſtle, ſtrange! Can thoſe that are the Children of the Covenant of Grace, ceaſe to be ſuch? May the Children of God degenerate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Dogs, Wolves, and Vipers? I thought that ſuch as are God's Children, or Heirs according to the promiſed Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham</hi> can never ceaſe being the Children of God; how elſe is the Promiſe ſure to all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Spiritual Seed? Do not all the Children of God partake of God's Divine Nature, and are not they all Heirs of God? Are you an Arminian?

            <p>2. Reader, 'tis plain that <hi>Iſhmael, Eſau,</hi> &amp;c. and many more of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Natural Seed, nay all, as ſuch, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. True, the Privileges of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Natural Seed, as ſuch, were great, as to outward Rites and Prerogatives; the Covenant did appertain to them [mark it!] (Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants) there were two Covenants, 'tis not ſaid Covenant. 1. They had right to all the External Privileges of the Legal Covenant; and the outward Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, and Adoption by Faith was firſt to be offered unto them, but neither they nor their Children, as ſuch, had right to Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Adoption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or any outward Rite or Sacrament

2. As touching Infants being in Covenant <hi>in facie viſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis Eccleſiae,</hi> in the face of a viſible Church. I anſwer; Tho they were ſo in all the Jewiſh Churches under the old Covenant, ſome with Circumciſion were brought in, and ſome without it; yet that Covenant and Covenant-Seed are (as I have and ſhall yet prove) caſt out, which will be a final Anſwer.</p>
            <p>Thus I argue;</p>
            <p>If the Covenant for incovenanting of Infants was the old Covenant ſignified by <hi>Hagar,</hi> and that Covenant-Seed ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by <hi>Iſhmael</hi> are caſt out; then the Natural or Fleſhly Seed of Believers are caſt out, or not to be admitted into the Goſpel-Church.</p>
            <p>But the Covenant for incovenanting of Infants was the old Covenant ſignified by <hi>Hagar,</hi> and that Covenant-Seed ſignified by <hi>Iſhmael</hi> are caſt out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Natural or Fleſhly Seed of Believers are caſt out, or not to be admitted into the Goſpel-Church. See <hi>Gal. 4. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. For it is written that</hi> Abraham <hi>had two Sons, the one by a Bond-woman, the other by a Free-woman.</hi> Ver. 24. <hi>Which things are an Allegory; for theſe are the two Covenants; the one from Mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>which gendereth to Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, which is</hi> Hagar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ver. 30. <hi>Nevertheleſs, what ſaith the Scripture? Caſt out the Bond-woman and her Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Son of the Bond-woman ſhall not be Heir with the Son of the Free-woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. By <hi>Hagar</hi> is meant, all agree, the old Covenant; and by caſting her out, is held forth the aboliſhing, or taking away of the old Covenant. <hi>He took away the firſt, that he might eſtabliſh the ſecond;</hi> Heb. 10. 9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By <hi>Iſhmael</hi> is meant the Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo the Natural Seed of all Godly Men of his Race that ſucceeded him, who were Members of that Church. And as the late Annotators note, by this place is ſignified the total Deſtruction of the Jewiſh Church, which conſiſted of Parents and their Children, or the whole Nation of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> This Church and Church-Seed, and manner of Church-Memberſhip is caſt out and gone for ever.</p>
            <p>We ſay that Children were once admitted Members of the Jewiſh Church; but evident it is, that God hath now quite pulled down, and razed that Houſe to the Foundation thereof, I mean that National Church of the Jews, and broke up Houſe-keeping, and turned the Bond-woman and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65865:50"/>
her Son, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Fleſhly Seed or Natural Off-ſpring of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> out of Doors; the natural Branches are broken off, and God hath now built him a new and more glorious, and Spiritual Houſe under the Goſpel, into which he admitted none as his Houſhold Servants, to dwell in this his Spiritual Family, or Goſpel Church, but Believers only, or ſuch as profeſs themſelves ſo to be. <hi>Ye,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Peter, as lively Stones are built up a ſpiritual Houſe,</hi> &amp;c. and that the old Houſe, the Jewiſh Church-ſtate, with all the Appurtenances, Rites and Privileges of it are aboliſhed, or pulled down, and a new own built and ſet up, into which Infants are not to be admitted, is very evident: <hi>Heb. 7. 12. For the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood being changed, there is made of neceſſity a Change alſo of the whole Law,</hi> which muſt needs include Circumciſion, with all Appurtenances and Privileges belonging to it. And therefore as Infant Church-Memberſhip came in with the Law of Circumciſion, and as a direct part of the old Covenant or old Law; ſo likewiſe plain it is that it went out, and was diſannulled with it.</p>
            <p>Take again my <hi>former</hi> Simily, <hi>viz.</hi> What Privileges ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are given to any Perſon by an Act of Parliament, which ſaid Law was to continue ſo long in force and no longer, than when that time was expired; and another Parliament makes a new Law, where many things are contained that were in the laſt Law, but thoſe divers Privileges given to thoſe Perſons in the former Law are left out in this latter Act: would it not be a piece of Folly for any of them to plead thoſe Privileges by virtue of a Law that is gone, and now not in any force? But to come a little nearer the caſe in a more apt Simily: Suppoſe a Man ſhould have a Legacy bequeathed to him by the Will and Teſtament of his Friend, and yet afterwards his Friend ſees good to make another Will, which is his laſt Will and Teſtament, and in this laſt Will and Teſtament he leaves him quite out, not mentioning his Name, bequeathing no ſuch Legacy to him; would it not be Folly in him to ſue for that Legacy left him in the firſt Will and Teſtament?</p>
            <p>Sir, the Caſe is thus in hand, we read of two Covenants or Teſtaments, an old and a new, a firſt and a ſecond. Now in the old Will or old Teſtament, Infants were admitted to this Privilege of Church-Memberſhip in that Legal or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church of the Jews; and National Church-Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges are now made null and void by the Goſpel-Covenant,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65865:50"/>
which is Chriſt's laſt Will and Teſtament, in which Infant Church-Memberſhip is quite left out, their Names not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mentioned, as having right to any Goſpel-Ordinance, as Baptiſm, the Lord's-Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we would know the Mind of God herein, we muſt of neceſſity have recourſe to Chriſt's laſt Will and Teſtament. Since the Goſpel is ſo called, and that the firſt or old one is taken away, and there is no Man can prove any one old Rite that did appertain to the Natural Off-ſpring of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> or Believers, remains to them, which is not mentioned in the new of laſt Will or Teſtament of Jeſus Chriſt; 'tis plain they had (or leaſtwiſe ſome of them) other exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Privileges beſides that of Circumciſion, and yet I ſee no Man contend for any one Rite, but only this they call the Seal of the Covenant. Why might not Miniſters plead for all their Sons to have right to the Miniſtry, ſince that Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege was given them in the Old Teſtament; and that all Male-Children that open the Womb to be holy to the Lord, which Bleſſings belonged to them under the Law, and alſo plead for the Tenths and Firſt-fruits? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I deſire you and all Pedo-baptiſts carefully to conſider and weigh what I have ſaid; I have ſhew'd you and them how Infants, who were once in Covenant, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the Jewiſh or old Covenant, are caſt out, or left out; for indeed they were never admitted into the New Teſtament-Church; but ſince they are not put in, and the old Covenant, and old Church-Memberſhip are caſt out and gone, in vain it is for any to plead their Right by an abrogated Law. Beſides,</p>
            <p>You ſay, Circumciſion was the Seal of that Covenant, by virtue of which Infants had Right to Church Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: if ſo, 'tis evident that Covenant is gone, becauſe 'tis cancelled; for the tearing off, or breaking off the Seal, we all look upon as cancelling a Covenant.</p>
            <p>That Circumciſion (the Seal as you call it) is broken off, I am ſure you cannot deny; Sir, what is then become of your Covenant for incovenanting Children?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But may be you will object and ſay, that you do not contend for that particular Rite or Inſtitution of a viſible Church-Memberſhip of Infants, perpetual in all Ages, and an indefinite Seal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. How doth it appear the Infants of the Godly before <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, had any Right to viſible Church-Memberſhip, or what Seal had they?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:65865:51"/>
2. Such a Right is a meer Figment-like <hi>Idea Platonica.</hi> All Inſtitutions meerly poſitive are of ſuch Rite in particular, and an initial Seal is meerly poſitive, as Signs that are not natural, but by the Will of the Appointer; and therefore there is no initial Seal indefinite.</p>
            <p>Sir, now you have no way left, but to ſee ſince the old Covenant is cancelled, whether you can find the Baptiſm of Infants in the New Teſtament, and there taught, laid down and prefix'd to it, as Circumciſion was to the Old? Do that and you do all; do not that, and all you do is juſt nothing. You with others ſeem to ſay that the Privileges of the Goſpel are ſtraiter and narrower than thoſe of the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If you once imagine, that the outward or exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Privileges of the Goſpel are larger, or ſo large as thoſe were under the Law, you are greatly miſtaken. The Jews and Jewiſh Teachers or Prieſts had many external Privileges, which Chriſtians and Miniſters under the Goſpel have not; they had a lovely Country promiſed to them, <hi>a Land that flowed with Milk and Honey:</hi> outward Peace, Riches, and gathering of Wealth, where Privileges belonged to them; but we under the Goſpel have no ſuch Privileges, but are to expect Perſecution, and what not? Yet our Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges are better and greater, tho more ſpiritual; 'tis a Covenant <hi>eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes:</hi> Our Children, when grown up, ſit under the clear and glorious Light of the Goſpel, which they and theirs then held forth but in dark Shadows.</p>
            <p>Moreover, then the Church-ſtate was confined to the Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. but now all in all Nations who repent and believe the Goſpel; the poor Gentiles are now become fellow-Heirs indeed. Our ſpiritual Privileges do infinitely excel theirs, but not in Externals; now are greater Infuſions of the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>O, Sir, what Privileges had the Gentiles or their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren then! is not the caſe mended with us?</p>
            <p>Again, 'tis objected by ſome Pedo-baptiſts, <q>If it were the Will of God, Infants under the Goſpel ſhould be reckoned as out of his Covenant who were in Covenant, then it follows, ſay they, that our Saviour was unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or forgetful to his Church, in that he never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her with this Alteration; but not one word by way of Prohibition do we find in all the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65865:51"/>
from whence we may conclude, that Chriſt's not repealing the Practice of initiating Infants, nor forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Admiſſion into the Church by Baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer, Had it been the Will of God that Infants ſhould under the Goſpel be admitted into the Church by Baptiſm, Chriſt, you might rather ſay, had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful or unfaithful in not giving the leaſt Intimation of his Mind and Pleaſure therein, who declared all things plainly from the Father, and was faithful as a Son over his own Houſe.</p>
            <p>2. That which is not contained in his laſt Will and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament in this and other matters, is ſufficient to declare his Mind and Will in the Negative. And ſo you know 'tis in all laſt Wills and Teſtaments among Men, if it be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Affirmative, it needs not be expreſſed in the Negative; and if not, becauſe 'tis not forbidden it may be done, ſo may an hundred things more; nay many Jewiſh Rites, and Popiſh Innovations too, for where are they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid? The Sum therefore of my Anſwer is this: The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, which are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ites, Ordinances, or Sacraments, are not ſo many as you would have, or ſo many as the Jews of old had; nor are they to be adminiſtred according as they fancy or approve of, or according to their Reaſonings, but according to God's expreſs Appointment.

            <p>Were it not thus, how could we deny or oppoſe the Papiſts ſeven Sacraments? or condemn Salt, Oil, Spittle to be uſed in Baptiſm, which they uſe in it, ſeeing theſe are not forbid? But well ſaith <hi>Tertullian,</hi>

               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:65865:52"/>
Moreover, denying Infants any Right to Goſpel-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, cannot fill the Mouths of Jewiſh Children with clamorous and paſſionate Complaints againſt Chriſtianity, becauſe they could not ſee Jewiſh Children had ſuch benefit by Circumciſion as you intimate: No, no, they muſt yield to the Sovereign Will of the great Lord, and plead for no more Privileges, nor any otherwiſe than he ſeems good to ordain and appoint.</p>
            <p>I am ſure if what you and other Pedo-baptiſts ſay was true, it is enough to fill the Mouths of poor Unbelievers Children among us who are Gentiles, with clamorous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt their Parents, if they did regard what you ſay; and doubtleſs there are more of them, I mean, more Children born of Ungodly Parents, than ſuch born of Godly Parents: And what may they ſay, and how may they expoſtulate their own Condition? Alas! alas! ſad is our State, our Parents were wicked and ungodly People, and we are by that means left of God; to us belongs no Covenant, no Sacraments, nor hopes of Mercy; God hath taken none but the Children of godly Perſons into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant! We are baptized, alas! but had no right to it; our Condition is as bad as the State of the Children of Pagans and Turks! Sir, if People did conſider well the Purport of this Doctrine, they muſt needs have their Hearts riſe againſt all the Broachers of it: Nay, all or moſt Children may be in doubt, whether their Parents were truly Godly, and ſo in Covenant or not; for if not, you muſt fly to ſome other Argument to prove their Baptiſm and Church-Privileges, than that of their Parents being in Covenant. True, the caſe under the Law was another thing; for if their Parents were Jews, or the Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whether Godly or not, yet they knew they had right to thoſe external Privileges.</p>
            <p>I have ſeen ſome Arguments fram'd by a Pedo-baptiſt, in order to the proving that the Covenant made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> was a Covenant of Grace; and he endeavours to prove the ſame, 1. From the Language and Expreſſion of it. 2. From the Duration of it. 3. From the Bleſſings by it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Language and Expreſſion of it, <hi>Gen. 17. 7. I will be a God unto thee, and to thy Seed after thee.</hi> Now (ſay they) is not this a pure Goſpel-Phraſe, and ſhews it to be a Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> in Chriſt? I pray how comes the Almighty God (who, upon the breach of the Covenant of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65865:53"/>
Works made with us in <hi>Adam,</hi> became our enraged Enemy) to be a God unto fallen Man, any other ways than by a Mediator? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I have proved that there was a twofold Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and I deny not but the Covenant of Grace made in Chriſt was promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which takes in only the true Spiritual Seed, and to all thoſe God is in a ſpecial manner become a God unto.</p>
            <p>2. Evident it is, all manner of God's covenanting Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions ſince the Fall, of what nature ſoever, have been no other ways than through the Interpoſition of a Mediator, as that with <hi>Noah</hi> about the Flood, <hi>&amp;c. Gen.</hi> 9. 8, 9. in that God ſhewed himſelf to be the God of the whole World, and ſo he is by Creation and Providence; yet it doth not follow that Covenant was the Covenant of Grace; or that God hath received them into ſpecial Favour with himſelf. So when God gave out that fiery Law on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> he told them, <hi>Exod. 20. 2. I am the Lord your God,</hi> &amp;c. this was the very Introduction to that part of the Law which was written in Stone; but nevertheleſs the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly calls it, a <hi>Miniſtration of Death</hi> and <hi>Condemnation, 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 7, 8. and that it killed and could not give Life. Now muſt this be a Covenant of Faith or Grace? How is it then that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, the Law is not of Faith; alſo the Covenant of Grace giveth Life? But I argue thus, The Law could not give Life; <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Law was not a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. So much for the firſt Note or Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Obſervation is, The Duration or Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of this Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Lord calls <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t <hi>an Everlaſting Covenant,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This might have been left out, only it adds to the Number: this is anſwered by the Objector himſelf (be he who he will) in ſaying the Hebrew word for <hi>Everlaſting,</hi> ſometimes ſignifies no more than a long Continuance of Time: We know it very well; and thoſe Moſaical Rites that ended in Chriſt, are ſaid to be for everlaſting. But when the Lord ſaith he will be a Perſon's God for ever and ever, or everlaſtingly, it denotes his being ſo to all Eternity: But God never ſaid he would be the God everlaſtingly, or to all Eternity, to all who were concern'd in the Covenant of Circumciſion; nor was he <hi>Iſhmael</hi>'s God ſo, tho circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed; and has he not caſt off that whole Nation of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65865:53"/>
Jews, with whom he made that Covenant? and is not ſo their God now, tho he is, I confeſs, to all Eternity, or ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly, the God of all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Spiritual Seed; <hi>viz.</hi> all true Believers in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third and laſt Argument or Note to prove the Covenant of Circumciſion a Covenant of Grace, is taken from the Benefits and Bleſſings conveyed by it. <hi>To be a God unto him, and to his Seed, and that everlaſtingly,</hi> is a moſt comprehenſive Goſpel-Bleſſing; for hereby (ſay they) God gives a Perſon an Intereſt in all that he is, and in all that he has, ſo far as can be communicated to a Creature. This Bleſſing promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> comprehends Chriſt, Grace, Holineſs here, and Glory and Happineſs hereafter. And accordingly we find the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. uſes the ſame Expreſſion with this of God's to <hi>Abraham, I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is <hi>idem, &amp; bis idem culpandum eſt,</hi> the ſame again which is already anſwered. Is God everlaſtingly a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to all his Fleſhly Seed, and to Believers, who are the Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to all their Fleſhly Seed; I ſay, is this ſo? Does God give himſelf, all he is, and all he has, to every Believer, and to all his Fleſhly Seed? Have all their Children, or every one of them, Chriſt, Grace, Holineſs here, and Glory and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs hereafter? Or, are they not to be juſtly blamed who jumble things ſo confuſedly together? 'Tis true, the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all his true Spiritual Seed (who are the Elect) have Intereſt in all God is, and has, ſo far as it can be communicated to Creatures; and we know they have Chriſt (as well as are Chriſt's, as <hi>Paul</hi> notes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.) and Grace here, and ſhall have Glory hereafter. But a multitude of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Off-ſpring, and the Natural Off-ſpring of Believers has neither Chriſt nor Grace, nor ſhall be ſaved, but periſh eternally. Therefore this may ſerve for an Anſwer, with what I have proved before, touching the nature of that twofold Covenant made with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us come to what is further aſſerted:</p>
            <p>If the Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> be one and the ſame with the Covenant of Grace, then our Infant-Seed have right to Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This has been urged before, and I have already an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered it, only I ſhall add a Paſſage or two of <hi>Martin Luther</hi>'s.</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> therefore concludeth with this Sentence (ſaith he) They which are of Faith, are the Children of <hi>Abraham:</hi> That Corporal Birth, or Carnal Seed makes not the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham</hi> before God. As if he would ſay, there is none before God accounted as the Child of this <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> (who is the Servant of God, whom God hath choſen and made righteous by Faith) through Carnal Generation, but ſuch Children muſt be given before God as he was a Father, but he was a Father of Faith, was juſtified and pleaſed God; not becauſe he could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Children after the Fleſh, not becauſe he had Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion under the Law, but becauſe he believed in God. He therefore that will be a Child of the believing <hi>Abraham,</hi> muſt alſo himſelf believe, or elſe he is not a Child of the Elect, the believing and the juſtified <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> but only the begetting <hi>Abraham,</hi> which is nothing elſe but a Man, conceived, born and wrapt in Sin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Forgiveneſs of Sin, without Faith, without the Holy Ghoſt, as another Man is, and therefore condemned: ſuch alſo are the Children carnally begotten of him, having nothing in them like unto their Father, but Fleſh and Blood, Sin and Death; therefore theſe are all damned.

               <q>The Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> (ſaith he) is the Seed not of the Fleſh, but of the Promiſe: And this Seed is firſt Chriſt, and then all that believe in Chriſt; for all theſe are given to <hi>Abraham</hi> by Promiſe and Election of God. Moreover, this Seed is not many, (as <hi>Paul</hi> obſerveth) but one. It is objected, that the word <hi>Seed</hi> is a Name collective, and ſignifies the whole Poſterity of <hi>Abraham.

Now this Covenant we grant thus made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> is one and the ſame with the Covenant of Grace; but what does this ſignify to the Infants, or Fleſhly Seed of Believers, as ſuch? And thus I ſhall paſs to your next Argument.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ſay, the Children of the Faithful are in God's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, becauſe Chriſt is the Mediator of a better Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which was eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6, &amp;c. But, ſay you, if the Children of the Faithful are excluded from the Covenant, then the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is worſe, and not a better Covenant? It was a great Prerogative of Children being in Covenant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. for the Promiſes of God belonged to them; but if the Covenant be ſhortened in Privileges, how is it a better Covenant? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer; It is granted by us that the Children of the Jews, whether they were believing Jews, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Jews, godly Perſons or ungodly Perſons, they were in that external Covenant God made with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Natural Seed, as ſuch, or with the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the Old Teſtament, or old Covenant: But the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and that Covenant then ran not to the Seed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Jews only, but if they were <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, I mean his Natural Seed, whether Believers or Unbelievers. Circumciſion belonged to the Male-Infants, as ſuch, and all other external Privileges, but the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham</hi> ran only then as it runs now, <hi>viz.</hi> to all the Elect only, not to their Carnal Seed, as ſuch, but to their Spiritual Seed. If you are a Believer, you are in the Covenant of Grace; and if your Child in Infancy be one of God's Elect, that decretively is in the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, but not actually until it doth believe, and has actual Union with Christ by Faith, and partakes of the holy Spirit, which is the Bond of that Union, and Seal of the Covenant of Grace. No external Rite can be the Seal of the Spiritual Covenant. If therefore Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was a Seal of any Covenant, it was the External and Legal Covenant: tho <hi>Abraham,</hi> 'tis true, received it as the Seal of the Righteouſneſs of his Faith, even of that Faith he had being uncircumciſed; and in that ſenſe it could be a Seal to no other Perſon but to <hi>Abraham</hi> only: for who beſides him had the Righteouſneſs of Faith before they were circumciſed, and that they ſhould be Fathers to all
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65865:55"/>
that believed, not only of believing Jews, but believing Gentiles alſo? for ſo ran the Covenant of the Righteouſneſs of Faith God made with <hi>Abraham.</hi> And has God made ſuch a Covenant with you, or with any Believer now? Or, is there any ſuch Covenant-Head under the Goſpel, ſave Jeſus Chriſt alone? <hi>Abraham</hi> was but a Typical Father; the Covenant made with him and his Natural Seed, as ſuch, typified Chriſt, and all his Spiritual Seed.</p>
            <p>2. We have proved in the Legal or Old Covenant, there were many other external Privileges beſides Circumciſion, and external viſible Church-Memberſhip, ſeveral of which we have mentioned; to which we may add, they had a right to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and to a Civil Government and Governours among themſelves, or a Political Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, as alſo a right to a glorious external Temple. But, Sir, is the Goſpel Covenant worſe than that Legal Covenant, becauſe we and our Children have not ſuch Promiſes and external Privileges? Certainly if God pleaſes to open your Eyes, you will ſoon ſee and confeſs your Miſtake. Beſides, the Apoſtle calling it a better Covenant, and better Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, clearly ſhews they are not external Privileges, but ſpiritual: and ſo in that ſenſe I have proved the Privileges and Promiſes of the Covenant of Grace, do far exceed the Privileges the Jews had then; and our Childrens Privileges are greater alſo, tho not to be received as Members into the Goſpel-Church till they do believe.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ſay, the Covenant of Grace that God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> was an immutable Covenant, it was confirmed by an Oath, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 13, 17, &amp;c. therefore if the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are excluded the Covenant (you ſay) it is mutable; and if ſo, what is become of the Oath and the Promiſes of God? Where is the ſtrong Conſolation? Where is the Immutability of God's Counſel? Therefore (ſay you) thoſe that do caſt out the Children of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

2. Sir, Are all Believers Children in the Covenant of Grace? I affirm, and will ſtand by it, if ſo, they ſhall all be ſaved, becauſe all and every Soul that was, or is in the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſhall be ſaved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is an immutable Covenant, and God's Promiſe and Oath are paſſed to ſecure them of Eternal Life. Sir, the Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as ſuch, never had any ground of ſtrong Conſolation; God never made a Promiſe, and bound it with an Oath, that they ſhould all be ſaved; I ſpeak of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Fleſhly Seed, as ſo conſidered, or as ſuch; for if he had made ſuch an immutable Covenant with them, and confirm'd it by his Oath, What is become of his Promiſes and Oath, ſince he hath caſt off <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Natural Seed? O how prepoſterouſly you argue! See <hi>Rom. 9. 6. Not as tho the Word of God hath taken none Effect: For they are not all</hi> Iſrael <hi>which are of</hi> Iſrael: <hi>Neither becauſe they are the Seed of</hi> Abraham <hi>are they all Children; but in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy Seed be called,</hi> i. e. <hi>They that are the Children of the Fleſh,</hi> i. e. <hi>as ſuch, theſe are not the Children of God; but the Children of the Promiſe are counted for the Seed.</hi> Sir, this Text ſays as much as we do affirm. The Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham, viz.</hi> all the Elect of God, or Believers only, are in the immutable Covenant, and have ſtrong Conſolation; but who can tell or know who they are that are God's Elect Ones until they believe, or are under effectual Vocation? and that Election runs only to Believers Seed, as ſuch, you will not ſay: For many Children of Unbelievers we ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> daily are in God's eternal Election by their ſpecial Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and many Children of Believers are not elected, becauſe never called..</p>
            <p n="2">2. Were it the immutable Counſel of God, that all Believers Children ſhould be called, adopted, juſtified and eternally ſaved, you had ſaid ſomething, and then all their Natural Seed might have ſtrong Conſolation indeed. But alas, alas, how many Godly Mens Children prove wicked and ungodly, and ſo live and die! Were theſe ſuch, think you, that ever were in the Covenant of Grace God ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. Come, Sir, the Odium falls on your ſelf. I argue thus: If all the Children of Believers are in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet many of them eternally periſh, what then is become of the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65865:56"/>
and everlaſting Covenant of Grace? nay of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Oath of God? and alſo of the Doctrine of final Perſeverance? O what Shame do you <hi>Pedo-baptiſts</hi> bring upon your ſelves, by arguing after this blind manner for your <hi>Babes Baptiſm!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. But perhaps you will ſay, you argue for the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Privileges of the Covenant of Grace to belong to your Children, as ſuch, and not the ſpiritual and ſpecial Bleſſings of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If ſo, the caſe is ſtill worſe: for then it will follow, that God in the Covenant of Grace hath by his Promiſe and Oath, and Immutability of his Counſel, given to all Perſons ground of ſtrong Conſolation, that only have a ſhare in the outward Rites and external Parts of the Covenant of Grace.</p>

            <p>But why muſt your Children only have but part of the external Privileges of the Covenant of Grace, who only partake of Baptiſm, and not of the Lord's-Supper?

the eighth day: for ſuch that died before the eighth day, tho Males, had no right to be circumciſed, nor had his Females any right thereto; ſo none but Believers, when they can give an account of their Faith, by virtue of Chriſt's expreſs and poſitive Command, ought to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. Pray remember the Covenant of Grace, as ſuch, gives no right to Baptiſm; for if it did, all Believers or Elect Perſons had right to it from the firſt Introduction or Declaration of it to <hi>Adam</hi> upon the Fall. No, no, it is a pure Goſpel-Ordinance, and meerly poſitive, and only depends upon the Will and Pleaſure of the Law-giver, Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Honoured <hi>Britains,</hi> who inhabit North and South <hi>Wales,</hi> let me intreat you to conſider how falſe the Concluſion is that Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> draws, concerning the Right the Infants of the Faithful have to Baptiſm; namely, that if they are in the Covenant of Grace, then they ought to be baptized: For as he, nor no Man elſe can prove, the Infants of Believers, as ſuch, are in the Covenant of Grace; ſo it would not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, were that granted, that they ought to be baptized, it being not the Covenant of Grace, but the expreſs and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Command of Chriſt that gives Perſons juſt Right thereunto. Suppoſe Chriſt had not commanded Believers to be baptized, would any Man have adventured to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them, or conclude it was their Duty becauſe they were in Covenant with God? Or would <hi>Abraham</hi> have been circumciſed himſelf, becauſe in the Covenant of Grace, had he not received a poſitive Command ſo to be? Certainly he was long in the Covenant of Grace before he was cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, and did not ſin thereby, becauſe God had not given that Precept to him until he was old.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it was the expreſs Command of God that gave right to his Male-Infants to be circumciſed, and not only thoſe of his Seed that were in the Covenant of Grace, but <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and others who were not Children of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or in the Covenant of Grace, were circumciſed, and alſo it was not <hi>Lot</hi>'s Duty, tho in the Covenant of Grace, to be circumciſed, becauſe not one that dwelt in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, or his Natural Seed, nor commanded by the Lord to be circumciſed, or to circumciſe his Infants.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>Proving Infant-Baptiſm is not lawful, becauſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion under the Law belonged unto the Male-Infants of the Jews, containing an Anſwer to Mr. <hi>James Owen</hi>'s firſt Chapter.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IF, ſay you, Circumciſion under the Law belonged unto Infants, then Baptiſm under the Goſpel belongeth unto them; for even as Circumciſion was, ſo Baptiſm is the Seal of the ſame Covenant of Grace, and ſignifieth the ſame things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer; If Circumciſion did not belong to Infants under the Law, any otherwiſe than by expreſs and poſitive Command of God, which gave them right thereto; then if God hath not commanded Believers to baptize their Infants, it is not their Duty to baptize them, but their Sin if they do it. But I have proved it was the expreſs Command of God only that gave Male-Infants proceeding from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Lo<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s Authority to be circumciſed; and God hath given no ſuch Command to Believers to baptize their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; therefore Baptiſm doth not belong to the Infants of Believers, as ſuch, under the Goſpel, as Circumciſion did belong to Male-Infants under the Law.</p>
            <p>2. I have proved Circumciſion was not the Seal of the Covenant of Grace, tho it was a Seal to <hi>Abraham</hi> of the Righteouſneſs of his own Faith, yea of that Faith he had being not circumciſed. A Seal I have ſhewed gives an undoubted Right of all thoſe Bleſſings and Privileges to thoſe Perſons to whom the ſaid Covenant is ſealed, and ſo it did to <hi>Abraham:</hi> but it was no Seal of the Bleſſings of the Covenant of Grace to <hi>Iſhmael, Eſau,</hi> and many thouſands more who were commanded to be circumciſed. Were this therefore true that Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> aſſerts, That Circumciſion was a Seal of the Covenant of Grace to all that were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed in Infancy, then they were all ſaved, even all the Males that proceeded from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Loins, many of which proved as vile and wicked Men as moſt that ever lived in
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65865:57"/>
the World. Nor, Reader, is Baptiſm a Seal of the Covenant of Grace under the Goſpel; for if ſo, it would ſeal all Goſpel-Bleſſings to all Perſons that are baptized: who then (were it ſo) but would be baptized, and baptize his Children? Brethren, the holy Spirit only is the Seal of the Covenant of Grace, or Goſpel-Covenant, <hi>vid. Epheſ. 1: 13, 14. cap.</hi> 4. 10.</p>
            <p>You proceed, to ſhew in ſeveral reſpects, that Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and Baptiſm ſignify the ſame things.</p>
            <q>
               <list>
                  <item>1. You ſay, becauſe Original Corruption cometh by Natural Generation.</item>
                  <item>2. Becauſe we are born in Uncleanneſs, we muſt be waſhed in our Infancy.</item>
               </list>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Suppoſing that Circumciſion did, and Baptiſm doth ſignify the Corruption or Filthineſs of Original Sin, or Uncleanneſs; muſt we therefore baptize our Infants without any Authority, Command or Example in God's Word?</p>
            <p>2. Doth Baptiſm waſh away Original Corruption? I know the Papiſts aſſert it doth do this, but how do they or you prove it? Baptiſm, St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, doth not waſh away the Filthineſs of the Fleſh, or Corruption of Natural Pollution, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
            <p>3. Your Reverend Brother Mr. <hi>Stephen Charnock</hi> fully proves that Baptiſm is not Regeneration, that can't cleanſe from Sin. Anſwer his Arguments in his Book of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. What tho thoſe Baptiſts in <hi>Germany</hi> you ſpeak of, underſtood that the antient erring Fathers that introduced Infant-Baptiſm, did bring it in to waſh away Original Sin; Cannot Chriſt cleanſe Elect dying Infants from Original Sin by virtue of his Blood, in a way unknown unto us? Muſt we deny Original Sin, or own Infant-Baptiſm does cleanſe from it? Strange Divinity! you prove nothing.</p>
            <p>4. <q>You ſay, all were not regenerated in Circumciſion, but God bleſſed his own Ordinance in his own time, for the Regeneration of his Elect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So ſay you, not that all are regenerated in Baptiſm, but becauſe Baptiſm ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the neceſſity of Regeneration, and being effectual in time unto all thoſe that are elected, for working Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration in them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. You ſay, all were not regenerated in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and ſo, not that all are, ſay you, regenerated in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:65865:58"/>
Sir, take heed you do not deceive the Souls of People. I deny that ever any one Soul was regenerated in Infancy, either in Circumciſion or Baptiſm; nor did God ever or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain either of thoſe external Ordinances to regenerate young or old.</p>
            <p>2. I know the Scripture, and worthy Divines hold forth that Baptiſm is a <hi>Sign</hi> of preſent Regeneration; they that ought to be baptized, <hi>i. e.</hi> Believers, do riſe out of the watery Grave, as Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> aſſerts, new born Creatures; but thus do not Infants whom you baptize, or rather rantize.</p>
            <p>3. Prove, if you can, that God ever bleſſed Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Baptiſm to the Regeneration of any Elect Infants when grown up: But if none but Elect Infants are the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Baptiſm, why do you baptize, as you call it, all the Infants of Believers? Are all their Children elected, and none but theirs? Are not many Children of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers elected? Why then are ſuch not to be baptized, as well as the Children of the Faithful?</p>
            <p>Sir, we know not who are elected till called, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm belongs to none but ſuch who can make a Profeſſion of their Faith, and give Evidence of effectual Calling, and preſent Regeneration. You write but your own Phantaſie, not God's unerring and certain Truth.</p>
            <p>4. <q>You ſay, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Heart was circumciſed, before the Fleſh of his Fore-skin; but you intimate his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Fleſh was circumciſed before their Hearts were circumciſed. In the ſame manner, you ſay, our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors the Gentiles, were firſt Fruits unto Chriſt, and were regenerated before baptized; but their Seed are baptized before they are regenerated. To <hi>Abraham,</hi> you ſay, it was a Seal of the Covenant of Grace he had, and of the Righteouſneſs of his Faith before circumciſed; but to his Seed it was a Sign of the Righteouſneſs of Faith they were bound to receive for Juſtification, after they were circumciſed: and ſo you ſpeak of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers Seed in reſpect of Baptiſm.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer; <hi>Abraham</hi> only received Circumciſion as a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of his Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But prove that Circumciſion did bind all his Children to receive by Faith Juſtification: 'tis a bold Aſſertion. I have proved, that Circumciſion did not appertain to the Covenant of Grace, but to the external or fleſhly Covenant God made
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65865:58"/>
with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in him with the whole Nation of the Jews: and therefore 'tis poſitively affirmed by the Apoſtle, That ſuch that were circumciſed were bound to keep the whole Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3. not to receive by Faith Juſtification. Your Parallel between Circumciſion and Baptiſm ('tis true) well futes with the Human Contrivance of thoſe that firſt invented Infant-Baptiſm, who would thereby fain make the Goſpel-Church National, as the Jewiſh Church was, and confirm the old Church-Right and Church-Memberſhip, which is taken away, and a new Church-ſtate erected, which doth not conſiſt of Believers, and their Carnal Seed, as ſuch, but only of the Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who are Believers or living Stones, who are built up a Spiritual Houſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5, 6. The Goſpel-Church is not National but Congregational, ſay what you pleaſe to the contrary.</p>
            <p>2. Therefore as the Faithful at firſt among the Gentiles and Jews too, received Baptiſm as Believers, being regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated before baptized, ſo muſt we unleſs you have a new Goſpel, or freſh Authority to change the Adminiſtration of Goſpel-Ordinances, and the Goſpel-Church. I thought the Water as it juſt came forth of the Fountain was moſt pure, you do but plead for the muddy Water that has run through the Popiſh Stream.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ſay, Circumciſion was a Sign of Admiſſion into the Church of God, every Male did come in through that Door; the uncircumciſed had no right to the Privileges of the viſible Church. So you would have Baptiſm to run.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. 'Tis not true what you ſay, Circumciſion was not the Door into the Jewiſh Church, they were all born Members of that National Church, and therefore their Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males were as truly Members (that were not required to be circumciſed) as their Males.</p>
            <p>2. Tho we grant Baptiſm is the initiating Ordinance into the Goſpel-Church, yet it admits of no Members but Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers only; if any others upon a falſe Faith get into it, they have no juſt Right thereto, and, when diſcovered, are to be put out.</p>
            <p>3. Sir, tremble at the Thoughts of what you ſay! It is not we, but Chriſt in his Bleſſed Goſpel, that excludes Infants, or the Natural Seed of Believers, as ſuch, from being Members of the Goſpel-Church; he hath ſhut up that Door, <hi>viz.</hi> by Generation, <hi>i. e.</hi> being the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or Seed of Believers, as ſuch, and hath opened the Door
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65865:59"/>
of Regeneration: 'Tis we that believe, and our Children that the Lord our God ſhall call, and none elſe.</p>
            <p>4. Sir, Circumciſion was ſo far from being any ſuch a Privilege as you intimate, that the Apoſtle calls it ſuch a Yoke of Bondage, that neither they nor their Fathers were able to bear, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. And in Anſwer to what you ſay, <hi>p.</hi> It was not for their Sin, nor the Sin of their Parents that Infants are excluded, or not received into the Goſpel-Church, but becauſe it was the good Pleaſure of God to erect another, and more ſpiritual Church-ſtate, and to remove the old Way, and Typical Church-ſtate of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Therefore for you to intimate as if we were ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, as to caſt our Children out of God's Houſe, is not to be indured; it doth but reflect on the Wiſdom of God: we are more faithful to our Children (and not like the <hi>Oſtritch)</hi> than you, for we would not allow them that Right which God hath not; nor make them think in Baptiſm they were regenerated and made Members of God's Church, and ſo deceive, and put them upon a Temptation not to ſeek out for any other Regeneration, and Goſpel-Right to Church-Memberſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ſay, Circumciſion was an Obligation to put off the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh, and, ſay you, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm putteth us under the ſame Obligation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Baptiſm can oblige none to put off the Body of Sin, but ſuch that are the true Subjects of it, by virtue of Chriſt's holy Inſtitution, which are only Believers, ſuch who before baptized have received the Spirit of God ſo to do: But you, without any Warrant from Chriſt, would put this hard Obligation on your poor Infants, whereas you know nor whether ever God will give them his Spirit or Grace, to enable them ſo to do: And as one Pedo-baptiſt lately ſaith, If they do not diſcharge this Obligation, <hi>viz.</hi> their Baptiſmal Covenant, they are guilty of Perjury, and 'tis the damning Sin.</p>
            <p>O cruel Parents! you liſt your Infants into the Spiritual War by your pretended Baptiſm, and arm them not. The Graces of the Spirit are the Believers Spiritual Armour and Weapons, theſe they have when liſted, I mean baptized; but Infants, as ſuch, have not this Armour on when bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: Alas! poor Babes they have too much Guilt upon them naturally! O the Weight that lies upon them! but
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65865:59"/>
you <hi>Pedo-baptiſts</hi> add to it by your Tradition of a Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal Covenant, that God never appointed them to come under.</p>
            <p>Therefore you object, <q>How can Children be bound to that which they are ignorant of? You anſwer, They were ignorant of the Bond of Circumciſion, and yet were bound over to the Law to take him to be their God, and to depart from the ways of Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe God obliged and bound over the Jews by Circumciſion in their Infancy in that Legal Covenant, to love the Lord their God with all their Hearts, to take him to be their God, and to depart from all the ways of Sin, nay to keep the Law perfectly, (which ſhewed the neceſſity of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs and Merits) which was nevertheleſs upon this reſpect a Yoke of Bondage, which Yoke by Chriſt we and our Children are delivered from: Will you adventure to bring your poor Children under another like Yoke of Bondage? <hi>Chriſt's Yoke is eaſy, and his Burden is light,</hi> becauſe he gives all that are to be baptized his Spirit, and a changed Heart to love God, and cleave to him, and ſerve him; but you make his Yoke as hard as the Yoke of Circumciſion, by putting Baptiſm on your poor Infants, to oblige them thereby to be regenerated and love God with all their Hearts, before Grace in the Habit of it is infuſed into them, and all this without the leaſt Authority from Chriſt or the Goſpel. O cruel Parents! Sirs, who hath required this at your Hands? You ſhall hear more of this hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You do intimate, that 'tis true Circumciſion did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige to keep the Law perfectly ſince the Law, but from the beginning it was not ſo; for, ſay you, Circumciſion was not of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but of the Fathers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 22.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Was not the Moral Law from the beginning? and were not thoſe that were circumciſed bound to keep the Moral as well as the Ceremonial Law? How then dare you ſay, and prove it not, that from the beginning it was not ſo, <hi>i. e.</hi> It did not bind <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Natural Seed exactly to keep the Moral Law, that is, to love God with all their Hearts, and their Neighbours as themſelves, yea to leave and loath all Sin?</p>
            <p>Circumciſion I have proved was no Seal nor part of the Covenant of Grace, but of, and part of the Covenant of Works; ſo that you run into a dangerous S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>are, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

the People unwarily by your Ignorance of the two Covenants made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not diſtinguiſhing Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion from being a Seal to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, and not a Seal in common to all his Children. It was a Sign to them in their Fleſh, but no Seal of the Covenant of Grace. You further run a Parallel between Circumciſion and Baptiſm, as ſome others before you have done: Pray take my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Anſwers to all you ſay here which I have given to other Pedo-baptiſts upon this foot of account.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Others formerly have (as well as you do now) affirmed, That Baptiſm comes in the room of Circumciſion.</item>
               <item>2. They run a Parallel between Circumciſion and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and would have them both ſignify the ſame thing in an exact Analogy. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap> Say they, which you ſeem to affirm alſo, If Baptiſm ſucceeds in the room of Circumciſion, then as the Jewiſh Infants were circumciſed, ſo the Infants of Chriſtians may and ought to be baptized: But Baptiſm ſucceeds in the room of Circumciſion: Therefore as their Children were circumciſed then, ſo may ours be baptized now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There is no neceſſity that a Goſpel-Ordinance muſt ſucceed in the room of a Legal or Jewiſh Ordinance. What if I affirm, that no Ordinance ſucceeds in the room of Circumciſion? Were there not many other Rites and Ordinances under the Law, or Old Teſtament, beſides Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion? and yet you cannot find, or once imagine any Goſpel-Rite or Ordinance to come in the room of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, for that then it would follow, there would be as many Chriſtian Rites, Precepts and Ordinances, as there were Jewiſh Rites, Precepts and Ordinances, which, as one obſerves, were more than three hundred.</p>
            <p>2. Beſides, as Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> obſerves, <q>If Baptiſm came in the room of Circumciſion, you muſt baptize your Children always on the eighth day, and you muſt not baptize your Females at all, becauſe none but Male Infants were then circumcised.</q>
            </p>
            <p>3 And whereas you ſay that Baptiſm ſignifies the ſame things that Circumciſion did, it is not true, as will appear to all underſtanding Men, if they conſider theſe Particulars following, which are ſo many Diſparities, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Circumciſion was a Shadow of Chriſt to come; Baptiſm is a Sign he is already come, was dead and buried.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:65865:60"/>
(2.) Circumciſion was a Sign of the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Natural Seed; Baptiſm is a Sign of the peculiar ſpiritual Privileges made to Saints, as ſuch, and no others.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Circumciſion was a Domeſtick Action, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be done in the Houſe; Baptiſm an Eccleſiaſtick, belonging to the Goſpel-Church.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Circumciſion was to be done by the Parents in that reſpect; Baptiſm is to be done only by Goſpel-Miniſters.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) Circumciſion was the cutting off the Foreskin of the Fleſh, which drew Blood; Baptiſm is to be done by dipping the whole Body into the Water, without drawing of any Blood.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) Circumciſion belonged to Male-Children only; Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm belongs to Males and Females alſo.</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) Circumciſion was to be done preciſely on the eighth Day; Baptiſm is not limited to any preciſe Day.</p>
            <p n="8">(8.) Circumciſion made a viſible Impreſſion on the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which the Party might perceive when he came to Age of Underſtanding; Baptiſm leaves no Impreſſion on the Body.</p>
            <p n="9">(9.) Circumciſion belonged to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Houſe, to his Male-Infants only, or ſuch who were bought with his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and not the Male-Infants of any other Godly Men in his days, unleſs they join themſelves to his Family; Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm belongs to Believers in all Nations.</p>
            <p n="10">(10.) Circumciſion bound thoſe who came under that Rite to keep the whole Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> Baptiſm ſignifies we are delivered from that Yoke of Bondage.</p>
            <p n="11">(11.) If Circumciſion ſignified the ſame things, and conſequently, particularly the ſealing the Covenant of Grace, then thoſe that were circumciſed needed not to be baptized, becauſe ſealed before with the ſame Seal, or that which signified the ſame thing; but Chriſt and all his Apoſtles, and many others, who were circumciſed, were nevertheleſs baptized.</p>
            <p n="12">(12.) Circumciſion ſignified the taking away the Sins of the Fleſh, or the Circumciſion of the Heart; but Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm ſignifies the Death, Burial and Reſurrection of Chriſt, which Circumciſion did not.</p>
            <p n="13">(13.) Circumciſion was to be a Partition-Wall betwixt Jew and Gentile; but Baptiſm teſtifieth that Jew and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65865:61"/>
Male and Female, Barbarian and Seythian, Bond and Free, are all one in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Therefore there are divers Diſparities and different Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications between Circumciſion and Baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And what tho we ſhould grant that Circumciſion was then the initiating Ordinance, and Baptiſm is ſo now in Goſpel-Times, <hi>i. e.</hi> an Ordinance of Initiation; yet Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion initiated none into the Jewiſh Church, but ſuch who were by expreſs and poſitive Command of God to be circumciſed, who were only Male-Infants (for the Females were initiated without it); even ſo Baptiſm, tho it be an initiating Ordinance, yet none are to be initiated thereby, but only thoſe who by the expreſs Command are required to be baptized, and they are only ſuch who believe, or make Profeſſion of their Faith. Sir, Precepts that are meerly poſitive, greatly differ (you know well enough) from Precepts that are purely Moral in their own nature. Laws that are of meer poſitive Right, wholly depend upon the abſolute Will and Pleaſure of the great <hi>Legiſtator;</hi> and in all Caſes and Circumſtances we muſt keep to the expreſs words of the Inſtitution, we muſt venture to do no more, nor leſs nor do any thing in any other manner than God hath commanded, as appears in <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> and <hi>Uzzah</hi>'s Caſes; the firſt for offering of ſtrange Fire, which thing God commanded them not (tho God in expreſs words no where forbid them ſo to do) were cut off, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>When God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to circumciſe on the eighth day, did he not virtually forbid him to do it on the ſeventh or ninth day? Therefore this ſort of reaſoning of yours is meerly ſophiſtical, and you do but <hi>darken Counſel with Words without Knowledg.</hi> Again, 'tis affirmed by you and other Pedo-baptiſts, That God hath no where declared that Infants ſhould be excluded; you mean, he hath no where forbid in expreſs words the baptizing of Infants: No more, ſay I, has he forbid Honey, Wine, Oil, Salt, and Spittle to be uſed in Baptiſm; the former was uſed by ſome of the <hi>Antient Fathers,</hi> and the latter is ſtill in the Romiſh Church: Where are we forbid to baptize Bells, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate Water, as the Papiſts do to make it holy Water? Alſo where are Infants excluded from the Lord's-Table? If therefore any thing may be done in God's Worſhip which you ſuppoſe is not forbid, and bears alſo ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in Signification with Jewiſh Rites, all Popiſh Rites
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65865:61"/>
and Ceremonies may be let in at the ſame Door: For the <hi>Pope, Miter,</hi> Popiſh Veſtures, Candle and Candleſticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they no doubt will tell you are of like Signification with the High-Prieſt under the Law, with the Prieſt's Veſtures, and other Ceremonies among the Jews. Whither will this lead you? 'tis dangerous to be led by ſuch a Guide.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, we will come to that grand Proof for Infant-Baptiſm you mention, <hi>i. e.</hi> That Baptiſm doth come in the room of Circumciſion, which is in <hi>Col. 2. 11, 12. In whom alſo ye are circumciſed with the Circumciſion made without Hands, by the Circumciſion of Chriſt; buried with him in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> &amp;c. It is affirmed, <q>That the Deſign of the Apoſtle here is to take the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> off from the old Sacrament of Circumciſion: He informs them that there was no Reaſon why they ſhould be fond of it, becauſe they were compleat without it, Chriſt having ſubſtituted a new Circumciſion in the room of it, namely, Baptiſm; and accordingly Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may now be ſaid, by Baptiſm, to be ſpiritually circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, as the Jews were ſaid to be ſpiritually baptized.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Expoſition of this Text there is no ground to admit of; the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Power or Virtue of Chriſt's Circumciſion: His Deſign is to ſhew we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in Chriſt, and have him on; he mentions Faith as well as Baptiſm, or ſuch a Faith that ſhould always attend Baptiſm; and therefore Infant-Baptiſm from hence cannot be proved, or inferred, nor the leaſt ground for ſuch a bold Concluſion from hence, <hi>viz.</hi> That Baptiſm came in the room of Circumciſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For firſt, the Apoſtle 'tis true excludes Circumciſion, but 'tis upon another account, <hi>viz.</hi> by ſhewing Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was a Figure of the Circumciſion of the Heart, as <hi>Rom. 2. 28, 29. Phil.</hi> 3. 3. and ſince they had the ſame ſignified thereby, the Rite or Sign ceaſed. And as I have formerly replied in Anſwer to this Text, ſo I muſt ſay to you, all that can well be aſſerted from this Scriptare, where the Apoſtle brings in Baptiſm, is no more than this, <hi>viz.</hi> That where Baptiſm is rightly adminiſtred, upon a proper Subject, it repreſents the Spiritual and Myſtical Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the Heart, <hi>i. e. That the Soul is dead to Sin,</hi> or <hi>hath put off the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh, by the Circumciſion of Chriſt;</hi> which may refer to the Power of his Death in the bleſſed Effects thereof, by the effectual Sin-killing Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Spirit on the Heart. And as being dead to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65865:62"/>
Sin, we are buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm, both in Sign and Token of Chriſt's Burial, <hi>i. e.</hi> covered all over in the Water, which is a clear Symbol of his Burial; alſo in Signification, <hi>i. e.</hi> that we being dead, and buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm, ſo are to riſe with him by the Faith of the Operation of God; and both theſe are held forth in true Baptiſm. The Apoſtle doth not mention Baptiſm to come in the room of Circumciſion, but to ſhew that theſe believing <hi>Coloſſians</hi> had through Chriſt by the Spirit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Antitype thereof, or thing figured out in the Circumciſion of the Fleſh, which Baptiſm did clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent. But ſince this is ſo ſtrenuouſly urged afreſh, tho ſo often anſwered, I will be at the trouble to tranſcribe once more what Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> late Biſhop of <hi>Down,</hi> hath ſaid to this Argument of yours, and others before you, about Circumciſion, <hi>viz.</hi> That Baptiſm is the Antitype of it, or that it came in the room thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Argument (ſaith he) from Circumciſion is invalid upon infinite Conſiderations: Figures and Types prove nothing, unleſs a Command go along with them, or ſome thing expreſs to ſignify ſuch to be their Purpoſe; for the Deluge of Waters and Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> were Figures of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, ſaith <hi>Peter.</hi> If therefore the Circumſtances of the one be drawn to the other, we ſhall make Baptiſm a Prodigy rather than a Rite. The Paſchal Lamb was a Figure of the Euchariſt, which ſucceeds the other, as Baptiſm doth Circumciſion: But becauſe there was in the Manducation of the Paſchal Lamb no Preſcription of Sacramental Drink, ſhall we conclude from hence the Euchariſt is to be adminiſtred in one kind? To which let me add, Becauſe Children, Servants, and all in the Houſe might ear of the Paſſover, muſt our Children and all in our Houſe eat of the Euchariſt, or Supper of the Lord? But ſaith the Doctor, In this very Inſtance of this Argument; ſuppoſe a Correſpondency of the Analogy between Circumciſion and Baptiſm, yet there is no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency of Identity; for tho it be granted both of them did conſign the Covenant of Faith, yet there is nothing in the Circumſtances of Children being circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, that ſo concerns that Myſtery, but that it might well be given to Men of Reaſon, becauſe Circumciſion left a Character in the Fleſh, which being imprinted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Infants, did its Work to them when they came to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65865:62"/>
Age; and ſuch a Character was neceſſary, becauſe there was no word added to the Sign. But Baptiſm imprints nothing that remains on the Body; and if it leaves any Character at all, it is upon the Soul, to which the word is added, which is as much a part of the Sacrament as the Sign it ſelf; for both which Reaſons it is requiſite that the Party baptized ſhould be capable of Reaſon, that he may be capable both of the Word and of the Sacrament, and the Impreſs upon the Spirit. Since therefore the Reaſon of the Parity does wholly fail, there is nothing left to infer a neceſſity of complying in the Circumſtance of Age any more than in the other Annexes of Types. The Infant muſt alſo preciſely be baptized upon the eighth day, and Females muſt not be baptized at all, becauſe not circumciſed. But it were more proper, if we would underſtand it aright, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the Analogy from the Type to the Antitype, by the way of Letter and Spirit, and Signification; and as Circumciſion figures Baptiſm, ſo alſo the Adjuncts of the circumciſed ſhall ſignify ſomething ſpiritual in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents of Baptiſm: and therefore as Infants were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, ſo ſpiritual Infants ſhould be baptized, which is ſpiritual Circumciſion; for therefore Babes had the Miniſtry of the Type, to ſignify that we muſt, when we give our Names to Chriſt, become Children in Malice, and then the Type is made compleat.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, as I have formerly ſaid, the worthy Doctor hath given you a full Anſwer to all you have ſaid concerning your Arguments for Baptiſm coming in the room of, or being a Figure of Circumciſion. But to proceed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If Baptiſm and Circumciſion were both in full force together for ſome time, then Baptiſm is not the Antitype of, nor came in the room of Circumciſion.</p>
            <p>But Baptiſm and Circumciſion were both in full force to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for ſome time; therefore Baptiſm is no Antitype of, nor came in the room of Circumciſion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is undeniable: Was not Baptiſm in full force from the time that <hi>John</hi> received it from Heaven, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred it on the People? And did not Chriſt by his Diſciples baptize many Perſons, nay more Diſciples than <hi>John?</hi> as it is ſaid <hi>John</hi> 4. 1, 2. and was not Circumciſion then in full force too, and ſo abode till Chriſt took it away by nailing it with all other Jewiſh Rites to his Croſs?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:65865:63"/>
And as to the Sequel of the <hi>Major,</hi> that cannot be denied: for if one thing cannot come in the room and place of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till the other is actually and legally removed, and took out of the way, which is plain; then ſince theſe two Rites had a Being together, the <hi>Major</hi> is undeniable. A Type can abide no longer than till the Antitype is come, therefore Baptiſm is not the Antitype of Circumciſion, or came not in the room and place thereof; the Antitype of which, or that which came in the room of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the Fleſh, is the Circumciſion of the Heart, not in the Fleſh but in the Spirit, <hi>whoſe Praiſe is not of Men,</hi> but of God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And indeed how one thing that was a Figure or Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow ſhould come in the room, or be the Antitype of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing which is a Figure or Shadow, no wiſe Man can ſee Reaſon to believe. And thus your great Text, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11, 12. is plainly and honeſtly opened, according to the ſcope and main drift of the Spirit of God therein, and your great Pillar for your Scriptureleſs Practice of Babes Baptiſm, razed and utterly overthrown.</p>
            <p>I have met with an Anſwer given to the like pretended Proof for Pedo-baptiſm, written by a moſt Learned and Reverend Author. The Argument and Anſwer I have been at the pains to tranſcribe, which take here as followeth.</p>
            <p>The Argument runs thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>To them to whom Circumciſion did agree, to them Baptiſm doth agree; but Circumciſion did agree to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; therefore alſo Baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> he endeavours thus to prove, <hi>i. e.</hi> If the Baptiſm of Chriſt ſucceeds in the room and place of Circumciſion, then Baptiſm belongs to them that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion belonged to: but the Antecedent is true, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Conſequent. The <hi>Minor</hi> he ſays is proved from <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. 'tis ſaid the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> were circumciſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe baptized.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Argument ſuppoſeth Baptiſm to ſucceed in the room of Circumciſion, which may be underſtood many ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. So as that the ſenſe be, that thoſe Perſons may be baptized, which heretofore by God's Appointment were to be circumciſed, and in this ſenſe the Argument muſt proceed, if it conclude to the purpoſe: but in this ſenſe it is falſe, for Females were not circumciſed, which yet were
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65865:63"/>
baptized, as <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 12, 13, 14. &amp; 16. 14, 15. and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers out of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Houſe, as <hi>Lot, Melchiſedec, Joh,</hi> were not to be circumciſed, but believing Gentiles are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally to be baptized.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It may be ſo underſtood as if the Rite of Baptiſm then began when the Rite of Circumciſion did, or was to end: but this is not to be ſaid; for <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt and Chriſt's Diſciples baptized, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 1, 2. before Circumciſion of right ceaſed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It may be underſtood as if Baptiſm did ſucceed in the place of Circumciſion in reſpect of its Signification, which is true in ſome things, but not in others. Firſt, both might ſignify the Sanctification of the Heart, and this is all may be concluded out of that place alledged, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11, 12. to which I think meet to add, that if that Text be looked into, the Apoſtle ſpeaks not of Circumciſion, but of Chriſt; becauſe in him we are compleat, and by whoſe Circumciſion we are ſaid to put off the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh: nor doth the Text ſay we are circumciſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are baptized, but that we are compleat in Chriſt, becauſe we are circumciſed in him, and buried with him in Baptiſm; in which, or in whom ye are alſo riſen together, through the Faith of the Operation of God that raiſed him from the Dead.</p>
            <p>In ſome things Baptiſm doth not ſucceed in the place of Circumciſion, in reſpect of Signification. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Circumciſion did ſignify Chriſt to come of <hi>Iſaac</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Fleſh, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 11. but Baptiſm doth not ſignify this, but points at his Incarnation, Death and Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Circumciſion was a Sign that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were a People ſeparated from all Nations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 1. but Baptiſm ſignifies, that all that believe, whether Jews or Gentiles, are one in Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 28.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Circumciſion ſignified, that <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law was to be obſerved, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3. but Baptiſm doth ſignify, that <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law is aboliſhed, and the Doctrine of Chriſt eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Circumciſion ſignified the Promiſe of the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> but Baptiſm Eternal Life by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And indeed, ſaith he, if this Argument be not warily and reſtrainedly underſtood, an Egg is laid, out of which manifeſt Judaiſm may be hatched: but if it be taken re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrainedly, it no more follows thence, but that Baptiſm and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65865:64"/>
Circumciſion in ſome things hold forth the ſame, which is more plainly ſaid of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. and of the Red Sea and Cloud, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. and yet we ſay not that Baptiſm ſucceeded in their place, much leſs do we infer any Rite to be inſtituted in their ſtead, reſpecting the ſame Perſons; yea verily it is to be ſeriouſly thought on,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That by ſuch Arguments drawn from Analogies not conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, but drawn out of our Wit, a new kind of inſtituting Right <hi>(viz.</hi> from Analogies) is brought in, beſides our Lord's Precepts and the Apoſtles Examples.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This being once ſaid, by a like Parity of Reaſon and arguing, it will be lawful to bring into the Chriſtian Church under other Names and Forms, the whole Burden of <hi>Jewiſh Rites,</hi> yea almoſt out of what you will, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, what you will; for who ſhall put a Bound to Mens ſeigning Analogies, when they go beyond the Lord's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and the Apoſtles Examples? It is well known that the Divine Appointment of Tithes to be paid, and many other things in the Writings of Divines are aſſerted by this kind of Argument, beſide the Rule of the Lord's Precepts, and the Apoſtles Examples.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thereby will the Opinion of the Papiſts be confirmed, who affirm the Sacraments of the Jews to be Types of the Sacraments of Chriſtians, which is rejected by thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines that diſpute againſt <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. This manner of arguing will countenance the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Papiſts for an univerſal Biſhop, becauſe the Jews had ſuch, and juſtify a Linen Garment at Maſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was ſuch among the Jews, and for holy Water, Purification of Women, Eaſter, Pentecoſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which the Papiſts do in like manner argue, as appears out of <hi>Durandus</hi>'s Rationals and other Interpreters of Rituals among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. Yea what hinders but we may give Children the Lord's-Supper, if we argue this way, ſince <hi>Samuel,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under Age, were Partakers of the Paſſover? and of right all the Males were thrice in the Year to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord; and therefore it is certain they did eat the Paſſover: and it ſhall be afterwards ſhewed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. the place will not avoid this Inconvenience, if the Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 29. may be ſhifted off, as Pedo-baptiſts uſe to do. Leſt any M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n take this for a light Suggeſtion, I will add
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65865:64"/>
that Grave, Godly and Learned Men have often warned that we are to take heed, that we do not raſhly frame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments from Analogy: Among others in their late Writings in the Engliſh Tongue, <hi>John Paget</hi> in his Defence of Church-Government, <hi>Part 1. cap. 3. p.</hi> 8. and elſewhere. <hi>John Ball</hi> in his Reply to the Anſwer of the <hi>New-England</hi> Elders unto the nine Poſitions, <hi>Poſit. 2. p.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>Laſtly; It is to be conſidered again and again, how by theſe Argumentations the Conſciences of Men may be freed from the danger of Will-worſhip, and polluting ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable an Ordinance of Chriſt as Baptiſm is: Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Care lies on them, who by Prayer, Sermons, Writings, Covenants and Oaths, do deter Chriſtians from Human Inventions in God's Worſhip, diligently, and it is to be hoped ſincerely.</p>
            <p>We further object, <q>That there was a Command for Circumciſion of Infants, but there is no Command for the baptizing of them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You anſwer, </p>
            <q>
               <p>The New Teſtament mentions but little of Infants, becauſe ſo much mention is made of them in the Old Teſtament, which ſaith plainly, that the Children of the Faithful are in God's Covenant, and that the Seal of the Covenant belongeth unto them.</p>
               <p>Neither the Old Teſtament only, nor the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only (ſay you) but both together, comprehend the Rule of Faith and Obedience. The Jews deny the New Teſtament, and ſome Chriſtians among us (ſay you) deny the Old Teſtament in reſpect of Infant-Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. You ſeem here to deny Infant-Baptiſm to be found in the New Teſtament, therefore would have us go to <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. for it: Strange caſe! that a pure Goſpel-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance that is of meer poſitive Right can be found in the Old Teſtament.</p>
            <p>2. Sir, tho the Old Teſtament and New together is a Rule of Faith and Obedience in many things, eſpecially in pure Moral Precepts; yet, Sir, in Precepts meerly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, I deny the Old Teſtament is any Rule to us: we are not obliged to Circumciſion, the Paſſover and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by virtue of the Old Teſtament, becauſe they only belong to the Old Covenant-Time; and as to Baptiſm and the Lord's-Supper, they that lived under the Old Teſtament were not oblig'd to them, becauſe theſe are
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65865:65"/>
pure Goſpel-Precepts; and the New Teſtament only is our Rule, and a perfect Rule too upon this account. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you cannot find Infants Baptiſm in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you and your Childiſh Baptiſm is gone for ever.</p>
            <p>3. The Old Teſtament doth not ſay the Children of the Faithful, as ſuch, were in the Covenant of Grace, tho they were in the Legal Covenant; but we have proved if they were, yet that doth not prove they ought to be baptized, becauſe the Covenant of Grace, as ſuch, gives no right to Baptiſm, but Chriſt's poſitive Command.</p>
            <p>Now theſe things being conſidered, what ſignifies all Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> hath ſaid concerning Circumciſion, tho it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſome things that Baptiſm alſo doth ſignify, if they differ in ſo many reſpects, and there is no Inſtitution of Chriſt for Infant-Baptiſm, as there was for the Male Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Jews to be circucmiſed; Circumciſion or Baptiſm being neither of them moral, but meer poſitive Precepts? But ſince Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith in his next Chapter, he ſhall ſhew that there is a Command for baptizing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; we will ſee how he proves that.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>Proving that Jeſus Chriſt hath not commanded Infants to be baptized; in Anſwer to what Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> affirms in the ſixth Chapter of his Book, concerning Chriſt's Commiſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>YOU begin with the words of Chriſt's Commiſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. thinking that he hath there commanded Infants to be baptized. We will read the words of the Commiſſion, <hi>viz. Go ye therefore, and teach all Nations, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: Teaching them to obſerve all things that I have commanded you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <q>
               <p>In theſe words, you ſay, Chriſt commandeth, 1. To teach the Nations. 2. To baptize them. 3. To teach them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:65865:65"/>
Here is; ſay you, a twofold Teaching, one before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, the other after Baptiſm, unto the Adult among the unbelieving Gentiles: Teaching precedes Baptiſm, but to the Children of ſuch Baptiſm preceded Teaching; in the ſame manner as <hi>Abraham,</hi> being the Father of the Gentiles, was taught before circumciſed, but his Children were circumciſed before they were taught.This youſay is the Signification of the word, as appeareth.  </p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer, you would have the form of the Commiſſion to run according to your Scriptureleſs Practice of baptizing of Infants, as you call Sprinkling; but that the Commiſſion is wreſted and abuſed by you to ſerve your turn, will appear,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They that are the only Subjects of Baptiſm according to the Commiſſion, are, firſt to be taught, or, as the Greek word is, diſcipled, or made Diſciples, and then baptized: and I will appeal to your Conſcience, whether they are not the ſame Perſons that were to be taught before baptized, that our Lord commands to be taught afterwards all other things that he hath commanded baptized Believers to obſerve and keep. You would have the Parents converted from Heatheniſm to be taught before baptized, but the Teaching afterwards not to refer to them, but to their Children baptized before taught, or in their Infancy. O what abominable Abuſe is this of the great Commiſſion of our bleſſed Saviour!</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Commiſſion runs, Teach them in all Nations, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jews or Gentiles.</item>
               <item>2. Baptizing them that are taught, or made Diſciples by teaching.</item>
               <item>3. Teaching them, <hi>i. e.</hi> the ſame them that were Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, baptized.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Dare you invert, nay ſubvert the ſacred Commiſſion, and ſo make void the Command of God to uphold your own Tradition? Sir, tremble at the thoughts of it!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. That this which we ſay is the true Purport of the Commiſſion, is acknowledged by Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and other Pedo-baptiſts. Take Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi>'s own words, <q>Firſt of all, ſaith he, 'tis ſaid, Teach them, that is, make them Diſciples by teaching them to believe and repent: here, ſaith he, we are to conſider the Order which God obſerves in making a Covenant with Men in Baptiſm. Firſt of all, he calls them by his Word and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65865:66"/>
Spirit to believe and repent; then in the ſecond place, he makes a Promiſe of Mercy and Forgiveneſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſeals his Promiſe by Baptiſm: They, ſays he, that know not, nor conſider this Order which God uſed in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting with them in Baptiſm, deal prepoſterouſly, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlipping the Commandment of repenting and believing, which is the cauſe of ſo much Profaneneſs in the World.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Doubtleſs he ſaid right; for you who baptize Infants that are not capable to repent nor believe, make a multitude of profane Chriſtians in the World, as they are called: Who knows which of the Infants you baptize God will call, and ſavingly work Grace in, which ſhould indeed be wrought in all, before they are, according to the direct Order or From of the Commiſſion, or ought to be baptized? O what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Wretches doth your Practice bring into your Church, if all you baptize you make Members thereof in their Infancy! Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> doubtleſs did not foreſee how by his honeſt Expoſition of the Commiſſion he overthrew his Infant-Baptiſm and Church-Memberſhip. Moreover, take Mr. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Baxter</hi>'s words, ſpeaking of the Commiſſion Chriſt gave to his Diſciples, <hi>Mat. 28. 19, 20, viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>Their firſt Task (ſaith he) is to make Diſciples of them, which are by Mark called Believers.</p>
               <p>The ſecond work is to baptize them, whereto is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed the Promiſe of Salvation.</p>
               <p>The third work is to teach them (that are baptized Believers) all other things which are after to be learned in the School of Chriſt. To contemn this Order (ſaith he) is to contemn the Rules of Order; for where can we find it if not here? See Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Right of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,<hi>pag.</hi> 144, 150. </p>
            </q>
            <p> This Man, tho a Pedo-baptiſt, yet durſt not be ſo bold as to invert the Order of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, nor do as you do, <hi>viz.</hi> affirm the Teaching men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned after Baptiſm, refers not to Believers baptized after they are made Diſciples, but to their Infants baptized, of which the Commiſſion ſpeaks not one word, nor can it by any colour of Reaſon or Conſequences be drawn therefrom. But to prove your falſe Expoſition of the Text, you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to do it, <q>Firſt from God's Promiſe to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> that in their Seed ſhould all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 18. &amp; 22. 18. Chriſt came, ſay you, to confirm the Promiſe unto the Fathers, that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65865:66"/>
the Gentiles might glorify God for his Mercy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 8, 9. If God is not a God to the Gentiles and their Seed, according to the Promiſes made to the Fathers, then, ſay you; Chriſt weakeneth and not confirmeth the Promiſes: God forbid we ſhould think ſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. God forbid that you ſhould reſt always under ſuch dark and cloudy Conceptions of the Covenant and Promiſes made to the Fathers touching the Gentiles; for the Covenant and Promiſes made to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were, that the Gentiles, through Faith in Chriſt, ſhould be Fellow-heirs with the Jews that believed in him, and with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s that b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed alſo. And thus runs the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace to <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. and thus it runs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentiles, that all of them, and their Children that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or are in the Election of Grace, ſhall be ſaved: And 'tis thus that <hi>all the Nations of the Earth are bleſſed in Chriſt, whether Jews or Gentiles, i. e.</hi> all ſuch in all Nations that believe, and are called by the preaching of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>2. But becauſe Chriſt's Church does not now in Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days take in whole <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>whole Families,</hi> as the Jewiſh Church under the Law did take in the whole Nation of the Jews, and all their Families, doth Chriſt weaken the Promiſes? Sir, that external Legal Covenant erected a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Church, which Church ceaſed at the Eſtabliſhment of the Spiritual Church, which is only Congregational under the Goſpel, as I fully proved before.</p>
            <p>But furthermore; <q>You ſay, the Apoſtles underſtood Chriſt's Command unto them in this ſenſe, and therefore they have preached Salvation to thoſe that believed, and all theirs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtles underſtood Chriſt's Command and Commiſſion no doubt, but it appears you underſtand it not. Did they preach Salvation to Believers, and to all their Children, as ſuch, whether elected or not, called by the Word or Spirit, or not? For this you muſt prove, or you ſay nothing; and how abſurd would that be ſhould you affirm any ſuch thing? <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of no Promiſe made to Jews nor Gentiles, and to their Children, but to ſuch of them that the Lord our God ſhall call. And 'tis directly ſaid that the <hi>Goaler and all his</hi> believed; therefore if you will ſtill affirm, that the Apoſtles apply'd, as you intimate, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant among the Gentiles unto the Seed, the fleſhly Seed of Believers, as ſuch, you do aſſert an
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65865:67"/>
Untruth, and caſt a Lie upon the Apoſtles through your Ignorance. Prove, if you can, they were to baptize any Perſon, Adult or others, that believed not, or made not a Confeſſion of their Faith. <q>Children, you ſay, are part of the Nations; for if the Apoſtles were to baptize all Nations, then they were to baptize Infants alſo, for Children are a great part of the Nations, near one half.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. 'Tis evident that our Saviour in his great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, enjoineth no more to be baptized but ſuch who are firſt taught, or made Diſciples, and this agrees with his own Practice; <hi>John 4. 1. He made and baptized more Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples than</hi> John: he firſt made them Diſciples, and then bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized them; nor were there any in the New Teſtament baptized, but ſuch who firſt made a Profeſſion of Faith in Chriſt. Do you read that thoſe Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. that believed and were baptized, were commanded to baptize their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, or that any other baptized Believers among either Jews or Gentiles were commanded ſo to do? or have we no perfect Rule left us in the Goſpel? for ſo it will follow if the Infants of Believers ought to be baptized.</p>
            <p>2. If the Commiſſion be ſo extenſive as you affirm, then all the Heathens and Pagans in all Nations that believe not, are to be baptized, and all their Children too, and all Unbelievers Children in Chriſtian Nations. Sir, are not theſe part of the Nations? Noble <hi>Britains!</hi> ſee the nature of the Pedo-baptiſts Conſequences and Inferences for bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing Infants. This Inference proves that all People and Nations in the whole World ought to be baptized from the Commiſſion: But I will, as I once did to another Miniſter, appeal to Mr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s Conſcience, as he will anſwer it at Chriſt's Tribunal, Whether he believes the Commiſſion authorizeth Chriſt's Diſciples to baptize any but ſuch who are firſt taught, and made Diſciples, whom St. <hi>Mark</hi> calls Believers, repeating the words of the ſame Commiſſion, <hi>Mark</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 16.</p>
            <p>3. Sir, are the Infants of Believers near one half part of the Nations? I am afraid you are miſtaken, this is the way to make Chriſt's Flock a great Flock; but the truth is, you have as much Reaſon to aſſert all the Infants of Heathens, Pagans and Unbelievers are to be baptized from the Commiſſions, as the Infants of Believers, and then it may be as you ſay, <hi>viz.</hi> they may be near one half of all Nations. But to proceed.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65865:67"/>
Sir, you ſay, </p>
            <q>
               <p>When God threatens to cut off the Nations from before the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the Children were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; for the Children were not ſpared any more than the Fathers. On the other ſide, ſay you, when Chriſt commandeth to baptize the Nations for their Salvation, he meaneth the Children as well as their Parents. If a Man would command a Shepherd to ſhear all his Sheep, and to ſet on them an Ear-mark to know them from other Sheep; altho the Shepherd had ſheared the Sheep and marked them, if he leaves out the Lambs without marking of them, he performeth not his Duty: If he ſays to the Maſter, the Lambs were too young for ſhear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, true ſaith the Maſter, but they were not too young for marking, you ought to mark them, for they are a great part of my Flock.</p>
               <p>If little Children, ſay you, cannot receive Inſtruction, they can receive Chriſt's Mark, even Baptiſm, by which Chriſt's Sheep are divided from the Goats of the Devil: The Church of Chriſt is his Flock, is there no Lambs in this Flock? Chriſt is the good and faithful Shepherd, who giveth his Life for his Flock, <hi>John.</hi> 10. 11. and will he not care for his Lambs and Weaklings of his Flock? yea certainly he ſhall gather the Lambs with his Arms, and carry them in his Boſom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer; 'tis a bold Aſſertion from your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and abſurd Conſequence, drawn from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion (as I have ſhewed) to affirm, when Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth to baptize the Nations, that he meaneth Children, <hi>viz.</hi> because they are part of the Nations, but I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that already; when Children do believe, they ought from the Commiſſion to be baptized, but not till then.</p>
            <p>2. As to your Similitude, 'tis much the ſame with that Mr. <hi>Burkit,</hi> a Pedo-baptiſt, hath in his Book which I lately anſwered. I will recite my Anſwer to him, which fully anſwers you both, and all others who talk after this ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e; he argues from the Commiſſion as you do. Take his Words and my Anſwer in order, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>The true Reaſon, ſaith he, why Chriſt bid his Diſciples firſt teach and then baptize, was becauſe he was ſending his Apoſtles forth among the Heathens to convert them to Chriſtianity; in which work we all know, that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word muſt go before the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:65865:68"/>
Should, ſaith he, the King of <hi>England</hi> ſend his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters into Foreign Plantations to convert the Indians to Chriſtianity, they ought not to be baptized before they are taught and inſtructed; but when the Parents are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyted, and make a viſible Profeſſion of their Faith, their Children may be baptized, and afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed; as the Children of the Jewiſh Proſelytes were firſt circumciſed, and then taught: For tho <hi>Abraham</hi> was firſt taught and then circumciſed, yet <hi>Iſaac</hi> was firſt circumciſed and then taught: ſo that the ſenſe of our Saviour is this, Teach ſuch as are capable of teaching, and baptize ſuch as are capable of Baptiſm.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer, firſt, how inconſiſtent is this with the words of the Commiſſion? By virtue of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on none ought to be baptized but ſuch that are firſt taught, or do believe; and therefore ſome Pedo-baptiſts pretend that Infants have <hi>Habitual Faith,</hi> Faith <hi>in ſemine,</hi> &amp;c. but you plead they may be capable of Baptiſm without Faith, and alſo contradict the Order of Words in the Commiſſion. Do you not confeſſ by the Order of the Words in the Commiſſion, Teaching ought to go before Baptizing? Sirs, 'tis a ſign of a very bad Cauſe that puts you thus to try your Wits, and after all confound your ſelves.</p>
            <p>2. I ask you how <hi>Abraham</hi> (whom God commanded to be circumciſed, as a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of that Faith <hi>HE</hi> had before circumciſed) could know he ought to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe his Son <hi>Iſaac, &amp;c.</hi> who had no ſuch Faith, had not God given him an expreſs Command to do it? Beſure if he had, he had ſinned in doing that which God commanded him not. So, and in like manner, ſince our Lord Jeſus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly in his Commiſſion, commanded none to be baptized, but ſuch who are firſt taught, unleſs he had added, as in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> when an Heathen is converted to the Chriſtian Faith and baptized, you may baptize his Infants alſo; How dare you make ſuch Additions to Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion without his Authority, and ſo make the World believe, if you could, our bleſſed Saviour gave forth an imperfect Commiſſion to his Diſciples, which all Men muſt confeſſ is the only Warrant and Rule of all Miniſters to act by in the caſe of baptizing to the End of the World? And doth he not ſay, <hi>Add thou not to his Word, leſt he reprove thee, and thou art ſound to be a Liar;</hi> by fathering that on Chriſt which he never ſaid nor intended?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:65865:68"/>
               <q>When a King, ſay you, by his Charter or publick Writing ſets at liberty the Inhabitants of ſome Town, are not the Children Partakers of the Charter altho their Names be not particularly in it? So, it is here, the King of Heaven is through the Charter of the Goſpel, making of us, that were Strangers and Foreigners, to become Fellow-Citizens with the Saints, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 19. and to that end commanding to receive all Nations through Baptiſm into the Liberty and Privileges of the City of God; and will he not receive the Children into the Privileges of their Parents?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, if it be ſo, as you ſay, in all National States, Governments and Conſtitutions, and Civil Societies, what doth this prove touching the caſe in hand, unleſs you dare undertake to affirm, the Goſpel-Church is National and not Congregational? Doth the Conſtitution of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Goſpel-Church run as in Human and National Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions? Prove it, for I utterly deny it. Beſides, if your Infants, as ſuch, are Fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and are to partake of all the Privileges of the City of God, why do you deny them the Lord's-Supper? your Similitude proves no more their right to Baptiſm, to one Privilege than another. I never yet could underſtand what Spiritual or Temporal Privileges any Infant receives in Baptiſm: What good doth that do them that have not the Things ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in Baptiſm? There are great Benefits received in ſuch a Grant you ſpeak of in an external Charter; but as God hath not commanded Infants to be baptized, ſo not any Benefits can be proved they receive thereby. In this you argue as Mr. <hi>Burkit</hi> hath done before you. Reader, take his Similitude, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>I demand, ſaith he, whether, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Mind of God gathered from the words of the Commiſſion, the Remedy preſcribed ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred only to grown Perſons, becauſe they only are capable of underſtanding and believing the Virtue and Efficacy of it? Sure every Rational Man among you would conclude his Child capable of the Remedy as well as himſelf, altho ignorant of the Virtue that is in it, and only paſſive in the Adminiſtration of it; and that it would be Cruelty, yea Murder in the Parent to deny the Application of it to all his Children.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> I ſtand amazed at ſuch Ignorance and Folly! Does it follow, becauſe Children are capable to receive a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65865:69"/>
Medicine againſt the Plague, or Bodily Diſtemper, are they therefore capable of Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper? If capable of one, ſay I, of the other alſo: For as a Man is required to examine himſelf, and to diſcern the Lord's Body in the Lord's Supper, ſo he is required to repent and to believe in Chriſt that comes to Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>I would know how they prove Baptiſm to be the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine appointed to cure the Soul of the Plague of Sin (or, as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſays, for their Salvation)? Is not this to blind the Eyes of the poor People, and make them think that an external Ordinance ſaves the Soul? if not thus, how can it be Cruelty, yea Murder in Parents to deny the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Baptiſm to their Children (as Mr. <hi>Burkit</hi> ſays)? The Antient Fathers from that in <hi>John 6. 53. Unleſs a Man eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, he hath no Life in him,</hi> gave Infants the Lord's Supper, thinking our Saviour (like as the Papiſts do) meant that Sacrament, when indeed he meant only of <hi>ſeeding by Faith on Chriſt crucified.</hi> But however, their Argument for giving Infants one Sacrament, was as good as yours for giving them the other. But when they are as capable to repent and believe, and are helped ſo to do, as they are, and do eat <hi>Bread,</hi> or receive a Medicine for a Bodily Diſtemper, let them have both <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's-Supper;</hi> and till then, if God's Word be the Rule of our Faith and Practice, (and not our own Fancies) they ought to have neither: yet the Remedy or Medicine, which is Chriſt's Blood, we deny not but dying Infants may be capable of, tho the way of its Application we know not as to them, that is a Secret as to us. You know the Church of <hi>England</hi> poſitively affirms, <hi>Repentance, whereby a Perſon for ſakes Sin; and Faith, whereby he ſtedſaſtly believes the Promiſe of God made to him in that Sacrament,</hi> are required of thoſe that are to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, nay and of little Babes too; therefore the <hi>Sureties</hi> anſwer for them, that they do <hi>believe and repent, or forſake the Devil and all his Works,</hi> &amp;c. the Child anſwers by Proxy. The Church of <hi>England</hi> baptizes no Child but as a Believer, and a true Penitent Perſon. All that are proper Subjects of Baptiſm are comprehended in the Commiſſion, and muſt be as ſuch, whether <hi>Adult</hi> or <hi>Infants,</hi> who profeſs Faith and Repentance. But <hi>you,</hi> it may be, foreſaw the Snake in the Graſs, <hi>viz.</hi> That Godfathers and Godmothers is a Tradition, and none of God's Appointment; nor are
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65865:69"/>
they able to perform thoſe things for the Child which they promiſe for him, and in his Name: And therefore make uſe of another Argument, and would have them baptized without Faith, or upon their Parents Faith, of which the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſpeaks nothing.</p>
            <p>As to your Compariſon it is not worth mentioning: Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, as I have told you, doth not cure the Soul of Sin, or ſave any Perſon, but it's the Blood of Chriſt applied by Faith. Not that we ſay no Child can have the Benefit of that Soveraign Remedy, becauſe not capable to believe, by reaſon Men and Women muſt receive it by Faith, or periſh.</p>
            <p>God, as Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> obſerves, may have many ways to magnify his Grace, through Jeſus Chriſt, to them, which we know not of, who die in their Infancy; yet have we no Authority to baptize them any more than to give them the Lord's-Supper.</p>
            <p>Pedo-baptiſts talk at a ſtrange rate, as if they regarded not what they ſay or affirm, while they bring Similitudes to teach People to believe Baptiſm is the Balm to cure the Contagion of Sin, and as if the Application of it ſaved a little Babe from Hell, and they guilty of murdering the Souls of their Children who deny to baptize them. I had thought they would not have laid greater Streſs upon Childrens Baptiſm, than on Childrens Circumciſion, ſince they would fain have them run Parallel-wiſe.</p>
            <p>Pray, what became of the Jews Female Infants, were they damned? and what became of their Male Infants, who died before eight days old? for they broke God's Law if they circumciſed them (tho ſick and like to die) if they were not full eight days old.

Man that heareth the words of the Prophecy of this Book, If any Man ſhall add unto theſe things, God ſhall add unto him all the Plagues that are written in this Book.</hi> Who told you what you ſay is the ſenſe of our Saviour? Can any Man once think, ſince the Commiſſion of Chriſt is a pure Goſpel-Commiſſion, and contains meer poſitive Laws and Rules, no ways referring to, nor depending on the Law or Command God gave to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that what you ſay can be true, and the Concluſion ſafe, certain and warrantable? May not another ſay, with as good Authority, that our Saviour commands his Diſciples to baptize all Nations both Parents and Children too, whether they will or not, whether they believe or not, whether Jews or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, Turks or Pagans? I wonder you are not afraid who take liberty after this ſort, to ſport (as it were) and play with, invert, alter and add unto the ſacred Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the jealous God, and great King of Heaven and Earth!</p>

               <q>1. You confeſs Chriſt's Sheep came up from the waſhing, whereof every one bear Twins, and there is none barren among them; <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 6. Let therefore the Lambs, ſay you, be waſhed, as they are a great part of the Flock.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer; Infants, as ſuch, by your own words cannot be Chriſt's Sheep, nor Lambs; for all his Sheep and Lambs that are waſhed are fruitful, and none are barren among them. Are Infants fruitful to Chriſt? Can they bring forth Twins? Sir, Metaphors go not on all four, (as we uſed to ſay); the Lambs of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> weak and young Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, may be as fruitful in Holineſs as Sheep, <hi>viz.</hi> old expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Chriſtians. But how can you prove Baptiſm waſhes your Infants from Sin? actual Sin they have none: Doth it waſh away Original Sin? dare you ſay that? The antient erring Fathers that brought it in, affirmed that Baptiſm did waſh away Original Sin in Infants; but do you believe that they ſpoke Truth in ſo ſaying? <q>Chriſt's Lambs, you ſay, are capable to be fed by the Word and Sacrament.</q> Are Infants capable to hear the Word, and partake of the Sacraments? If of one, of both. Sir, Chriſt's Lambs are <hi>new born Babes,</hi> not new born by Natural Generation, but by Regeneration, as I have ſhewed.</p>

               <q>You ſay, that the Gentile Church ſhould not come ſhort of the Privileges of the old <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or <hi>Jewiſh Church;</hi> and that the deſolate hath more Children than ſhe that hath an Husband, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 27. and hence affirm, if Children of the Chriſtian Church enjoy not the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of their Fathers, ſhe hath many leſs Children than the old <hi>Jeruſalem-</hi>Church had.</q>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer; the Gentile Church according to God's gracious Promiſe may be more than the Jewiſh was, when the Fulneſs of the Gentiles are come in, and yet no Infants Members of it.</p>
            <p>Nay, there is ground to believe in the Primitive Times there were more converted among the Gentiles, than were amongſt the Jews; but ſtill I find you harp on the old String, <hi>i. e.</hi> that if the Goſpel-Church be not National, and enjoy as many outward and external Privileges as the Jewiſh did, her Privileges are leſs: but you conſider not the Nature, Quality and Glory of the Goſpel-Church, and wherein her Privileges excel the Legal Church of old <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi>

               <q>You ſay, when Chriſt commandeth to teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before baptized, and after that their baptizing, his meaning is, teach and baptize to plant the Church, and baptize and teach to continue the Church planted among the Gentiles.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I am grieved to think how bold you are in aſserting that to be Chriſt's meaning which you affirm, which can no ways be gathered from his Commiſſion, but 'tis directly contrary to the expreſs words thereof, and alſo to the Nature of the Goſpel-Church's Conſtitution. But you affirm what you pleaſe, and prove nothing.</p>
            <p>2. It appears by your words, the Goſpel-Church in its firſt Conſtitution, or firſt planting, was by Regeneration, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting only of believing Men and Women, baptized on the Profeſſion of their Faith, or after they were made Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; but after its firſt Conſtitution, or firſt Plantation, it was to conſiſt of the Fleſhly or Carnal Seed, and ſo made National, yea and to be made up of whole Nations. Pray, Sir, ſince the great Commiſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. proves nothing of this, nor hath the Lord Jeſus given out another Commiſſion to nullify his firſt; What ground have you to affirm ſo preſumptuouſly any ſuch thing? Dare you add and diminiſh to God's Word, nay alter Chriſt's laſt Will
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65865:71"/>
and Teſtament in his grand Commiſſion? Tremble at the thoughts of what you endeavour to do! Sir, the New Teſtament about Church-Conſtitution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a perfect Rule to the End of the World; and as the firſt Goſpel-Church after Chriſt's Aſcenſion at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was conſtituted, ſo ought all Churches to be conſtituted, and ſo to continue unto the ſecond coming of Chriſt. The Ordinances are to be kept, as to the Subject and Mode of Adminiſtration, as they were firſt delivered to the Saints: See 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 2. Now I praiſe you, Brethren, that you remember me in all things, and keep the Ordinances as I delivered them to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore in direct Oppoſition to what you ſay in the cloſe of your ſixth Chapter, I affirm from the Authority of Chriſt's Commiſſion, and from the nature of the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel-Church, that as Teaching went before Baptizing for the planting of the Church in the Primitive Time, ſo Teaching is to go before Baptizing in planting and continuing of the Church unto the End of the World; and that the Teaching that is mentioned in order of Words in the Commiſſion after Baptizing, doth not refer to Infants of Believers, or any other Infants; but, as Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> obſerves, to ſuch baptized Believers, who, after they were baptized, ought to be taught all other things in the School of Chriſt, which he commanded his Diſciples to obſerve, and to which, if they thus act, he ſubjoined his gracious Promiſe, <hi>Lo, I am with you always, to the End of the World;</hi> Mat. 28. 20.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>In Anſwer to Mr. <hi>James Owen</hi>'s ſeventh Chapter: proving that the Children of the Faithful ought not to be baptized, becauſe they are ſaid to be holy; wherein 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. is examined, and clearly explained, with the ſenſe of many learned Men, both Pedo-baptiſts and others, on the ſaid Text.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>MR. <hi>James Owen</hi> thus begins in his ſeventh Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>If the Children of the Faithful are holy, then Baptiſm appertaineth unto them; for all confeſs that Holineſs gives Right to Baptiſm, if they allow that Faith gives Right, which is the Root of Holineſs in the Adult.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We do deny that Holineſs (I mean true Goſpel-Holineſs) ſimply in it ſelf, without Chriſt's Command, gives right to Baptiſm. No, Sir, you go too faſt; Holineſs did not give right to Circumciſion, but the meer poſitive Command of God to <hi>Abraham:</hi> for if it did, <hi>Lot, Job,</hi> &amp;c. had as much right to Circumciſion, and their Male Infants, as <hi>Abraham and his Male Infants;</hi> but that Holineſs gave no right to Circumciſion, ſimply conſidered in it ſelf, appears, becauſe, as I have before ſhewed, all the Male Infants of thoſe wicked Perſons that ſprang from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Loins by Natural Generation, had as undoubted right to Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by virtue of God's Command to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as had thoſe holy Mens Male Children that were of his Natural Seed. Moreover, 'tis neither Faith, the Seed, nor Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Fruit, that gives right to Baptiſm, ſimply conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, but the poſitive Command of Jeſus Chriſt, which, I affirm, indeed runs to ſuch who have Faith, Repentance, and true actual Holineſs, but not a Civil or Matrimonial Holineſs, as this is of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. as will appear by and by; <hi>Elſe were your Children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, but now are they holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:65865:72"/>
               <q>But how will it appear that they <hi>(i. e.</hi> that Children) are holy, ſay you? the Holy Ghoſt ſaith ſo in 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 14. Elſe were your Children unclean, but now are they holy.</hi> The Apoſtle in theſe words, ſay you, anſwereth a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion propoſed by the believing <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Whether it was lawful for them to live in the State of Matrimony with thoſe that were Infidels? they queſtioned this not without Cauſe, becauſe <hi>Ezra</hi> commanded both the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Wives and Children to be caſt off, <hi>Ezra 9. 1, 2, 3, 4. Paul,</hi> ſay you, anſwereth, that they ought not to do the like; becauſe the unbelieving Husband is ſanctified by the believing Wife, and the unbelieving Wife is ſanctified by the believing Husband.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. You ſay that Children born in ſuch a State are holy, as if both were believing; and this you deny to be Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation, or not being Baſtards, but that it is a Federal or Covenant-Holineſs. Such that were not in God's Covenant you intimate were unclean, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Prove your Infants, as ſuch, are in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace. We deny not but all Elect Infants are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretively in that Covenant; but are your Infants, or Infants of the Faithful, as ſuch, in the Covenant of Grace? If not, they are not in this ſenſe holy.</p>
            <p>2. Are there not many Children of Unbelievers elected? If ſo, are they not holy alſo? and if ſo, why not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized as well as your Infants, by your Argument from hence?</p>
            <p>3. Prove, when you write again, if you can, that there is any <hi>External, Relative, Federal Holineſs</hi> of Perſons or of Things in the times of the Goſpel, as there was under the Law; we deny it. I affirm all <hi>External, Relative and Fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Holineſs</hi> was but a Ceremonial Typical Holineſs; and will you bring in Ceremonial Relative Holineſs into the Goſpel Church? The <hi>Gentiles</hi> and their <hi>Children</hi> being not circumciſed under the Law, we grant, were in that ſenſe unclean: But will you call all Unbelievers Children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean now; for the Unbelievers Children you deny to be Subjects of Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ſay they are unclean that are excluded from the Privileges of the Church of God, it was not for any unclean Perſon to come into the Congregation, altho, ſay you, their Uncleanneſs was but Ceremonial.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:65865:72"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sir, God ſhewed <hi>Peter</hi> that Jews and Gentiles are now all one in Goſpel-times: Circumciſion nor Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion renders Perſons clean or unclean. None now are cleanſed or accounted clean, but ſuch who believe, or have Faith in Chriſt. All that you ſay about unclean Perſons, and things under the Law, ſignifies nothing to the purpoſe in hand, becauſe the Holineſs under the Law was either Ceremonial or Typical, which none can or dare plead for under the Goſpel-Diſpenſation, ſeeing the Subſtance and Antitype is now come.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Now in Goſpel-times there is no Ceremonial Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Perſons; and therefore in that reſpect no Holineſs of Perſons. The <hi>Leper</hi> was unclean, and he that touch'd a dead Corps was unclean, <hi>&amp;c. Swines Fleſh</hi> was unclean, and many other Beaſts, that are not ſo now. The Firſt-born was holy then, but not ſo now.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There was Pollution or Uncleanneſs of Places; the Houſe of a Leper was unclean, and his Garments unclean. So there was Holineſs of Places, the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> was holy, the <hi>Temple</hi> was holy, which were either by external Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, or typically ſo: But now there is no Place ſo unclean nor holy. In Goſpel-times there's no ſuch Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of Places, Perſons or Things.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Veſſels were unclean, and Veſſels were holy, but not ſo under this Diſpenſation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. All the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was holy by way of Legal Separation, or Conſecration to the Lord, tho they were wicked Perſons in reſpect of Spiritual Sanctification; but no Member of the Goſpel-Church that is a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, is accounted holy, or called holy by the Lord, holy now, becauſe not allowed by the Goſpel to be a Member. They are not conſecrated to the Lord, or ſet apart as Members of a Congregational Church under the Goſpel, tho ſuch were, if <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and of the Jewiſh Church, called holy by the Lord. Then theſe things being ſo, as indeed and in truth it is acknowledged to be, and that by our Godly Brethren, whether <hi>Presbyterians</hi> or <hi>Independants,</hi> what is become of your Expoſition of this Text?</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ſay, little Children are unclean by reaſon of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Corruption, but by God's Covenant and waſhing with Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they ſhall be clean.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. True, all that are born of Women are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually polluted; and no doubt but ſuch Infants that die,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65865:73"/>
who are ſaved, God doth, through the Blood of Chriſt, ſanctify them in ſome myſterious way not known to us, but not by Baptiſm. Prove that Baptiſm waſhes away Sin ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in old or young if you can; Who dares to affirm that, when <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith Baptiſm waſheth not away Sin, or the ſpiritual Filthineſs of the Fleſh? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
            <p>2. If God in a Covenant-way by Baptiſm waſheth away the Uncleanneſs of your Infants, then they were not holy or clean by being born of believing Parents; and if holy becauſe they are their Seed, then no need of Baptiſm to waſh them.</p>
            <p>3. And how come they to loſe that Holineſs afterwards, or is it only the Defilement or Uncleanneſs of Actual Sin that lies upon your Children who are polluted, when grown up? for if Baptiſm waſhes away any Corruption of Sin in your Infants, 'tis Original Corruption; and doth that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to them afterwards, ſo as to be charged upon them? All Sin in true ſanctified Perſons by Faith in Chriſt's Blood is waſhed away, and pardoned, as touching the Guilt and Filth thereof, and ſhall never ſo return as to be charged upon them to their Condemnation. Is it thus with your baptized Infants in reſpect of Original Sin? Speak, Sir, your Mind freely the next time; for, God willing, I ſhall be ready for you. O when will you ceaſe to corrupt the Word of God by your Tradition!</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ſay, Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> ſaith, If Children are Members of the viſible Church, they ought to be baptized.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I do not remember Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> ſaith ſo, and if they are Members of the viſible Church before baptized, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made Members by Baptiſm. 'Tis abſurd to ſay to a Man, Come into this Houſe; or to ſay, Bring ſuch a Child into the Houſe, that is in it before.</p>
            <p> 
               <q>For Baptiſm, ſay you, is the Door through which we come into the Church of God: Thoſe that ſay they are not Members of the Church of God, ought, you ſay, to ſhew us a plain Scripture for their caſting out, if they can, of one Church ſince <hi>Adam</hi> until this latter Age, of which little Children were Members, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And again, you ſay, if they were caſt out, how comes it to paſs that there is not one word in Scripture mentioned of it? call for a Scripture from thoſe that would ſhake your Faith concerning this Prerogative.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:65865:73"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I have anſwered this already. We ſay and prove that Infants were never received at all into the Goſpel-Church, therefore cannot be ſaid to be caſt out of it.</p>
            <p>2. We deny what you affirm without any Proof, <hi>viz.</hi> That Infants were always Members of the Viſible Church ſince <hi>Adam:</hi> Prove, if you can, they were received as Members before that Typical Church-ſtate which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family.</p>
            <p>3. The Firſt-born of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were holy, the Prieſts Sons had a right to the Miniſtery, or Prieſthood; ſhew when they were caſt out, and loſt both thoſe Prerogatives: and that very way you muſt take to anſwer will ſerve to anſwer your ſelf in reſpect of Infants Church-Memberſhip: The Anſwer muſt be this, the National Church, and Church-Memberſhip, and Prieſthood of the Jews are diſſolved, and taken away, and thereby all thoſe external Rites and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives the Jewiſh Children had, are gone.</p>
            <p>4. Theſe were as Legacies left in the old Will, in the old Teſtament: but there is a new Will made, or Chriſt hath made his laſt Will and Teſtament, and in this his laſt Will and Teſtament, none of theſe external Rites or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives (as you call them) are left to Infants. Sir, there is no need in a <hi>new Will,</hi> in the laſt Will and Teſtament, to mention Negatives, that is not uſual; not what is not left, but only in the Affirmative, what is left: therefore in vain is this Flouriſh, it will do your People, who are ſhaken in their Belief of your Tradition, no good.</p>
            <p>5. You bid them call for a Scripture from thoſe that oppoſe their Practice in the Negative, <hi>i. e.</hi> that forbid Infants Church-Memberſhip, or ſpeak where they were caſt out. O how dangerous is your Doctrine! May not the Papiſts ſay to them alſo, Where do you read holy Water and holy Garments are forbid? <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded the People to be ſprinkled with Water, and many other Rites that were among the Jews. We ſay the Papiſts call for Scripture where thoſe things are forbid which they have among them, or when God caſt them out of the Church? What Human Tradition may not be let into the Church at this Door?</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ſay, the unbelieving Jews would have ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled if <hi>Paul</hi> had caſt out their Children from the Church, and put them in the ſame Condition as the Children of Infidels.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:65865:74"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis your miſtake, he told them plainly, that the Children of the Fleſh were not the Children of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the Promiſe, or of the true Goſpel-Church, as ſuch, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5, 6, 7. yet they ſtumbled not; nay, ſhewed them they and their Children had no external Privileges above the Gentiles, and that Circumciſion availed them nothing; and yet the believing Jews ſtumbled not at his Doctrine. Sir, no doubt when the Jews are called they will not be of your mind, to plead the old Covenant-right of their Children, being Members, as ſuch.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ſay, That we judg the Adult holy, becauſe they are ſeparated unto the Lord in a Profeſſion of Holineſs, altho it be too often an Hypocritical Profeſſion, and ſhall we not (ſay you) judg the Children of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be holy whom God ſo called? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. God called the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> holy, becauſe he ſeparated them to himſelf, both Parents and Children, in a legal Church-ſtate, whether the Parents were Believers, or faithful Perſons, or real Saints, or not; but God in the Goſpel hath ſeparated none to be Members of the Goſpel-Church, but ſuch that are Adult Perſons, Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ued with real Holineſs. There is, I tell you again, no Fleſhly Relative Federal Holineſs under the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel ſpoken of, diſprove it if you can.</p>
            <p>2. As to the Holineſs of Infants born in lawful Wedlock, they are by the Lord called holy, or a Godly Seed, <hi>Mal. 2. 15. And did he make one? (i. e.</hi> one Wife) <hi>yet he had the reſidue of the Spirit; and wherefore one? that he might ſeek a Godly Seed,</hi> that is, <hi>a godly</hi> or holy Seed by Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; whether the Man or the Woman joined together in holy <hi>Matrimony,</hi> are Believers or Unbelievers, their Seed is a godly or holy Seed in this reſpect; and not only the Seed of the Faithful, as you intimate, but the Seed of Unbelievers alſo, and ſo not a Federal or Spiritual Holineſs, as you would have it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Seed born to the Faithful, ſay you, in lawful Wedlock are a godly and holy Seed; God calleth ſuch his Children that were born to them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 20, 21.

And now becauſe Mr. <hi>Burkitt,</hi> a learned <hi>Pedo-baptiſt,</hi> in his late Book for Infant-Baptiſm, argues from this Text as you do, and I have fully in anſwering him anſwered you both, I ſhall here repeat his Arguments, and my Reply: he ſays, <hi>Paul</hi> in theſe words anſwers the <hi>Corinthians</hi> Scruple; you ſay the Apoſtle in theſe words anſwers a Queſtion propoſed by the believing <hi>Corinthians,</hi> viz. <hi>Whether ſuch as had Heathen and Infidel Wives ought to put them away with their Children, as in the days of</hi> Ezra? <hi>The Apoſtle reſolves them that they ought not: For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the unbelieving Wife is ſanctified by the believing Husband. How ſanctified? Not in her Name, but in her Uſe,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Burkitt, ſo as that they might lawfully cohabit and converſe together. And for your Children they are holy, not with an Inherent, Internal, Perſonal Holineſs; for the holieſt Man-child is born in Sin, and by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a Child of Wrath; but with an External, Relative, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral Holineſs, they are not common and unclean, like the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Infidels, but fit to be partakers of the Privileges of the Church, which the Children of Infidels are not.</hi> Thus Mr. <hi>Barkitt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I anſwer, as I have anſwered him, you can't be ignorant, but that you know well enough this Text hath been fully opened by divers learned Men as well <hi>Pedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi> as <hi>Anti-pedobaptiſts,</hi> who prove the Holineſs here ſpoken of, is no ſuch <hi>External Relative Federal Holineſs</hi> you dream of. In the firſt place, you ſpeak right, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that very matter that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> wrote to St. <hi>Paul, viz.</hi> Whether the believing Husband might live or cohabit with the unbelieving Wife? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that the Scope and Coherence of the Text opens the matter, and ſhews what Holineſs 'tis the Apoſtle intends, <hi>viz.</hi> a Matrimonial Holineſs; for ſhould he make their Marriage void, their Children would be unclean or illegitimate, <hi>i. e.</hi> Baſtards: for tho <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> true, the caſe was not as Mr. <hi>Burkitt</hi> ſays concerning Men and Whores, but about Husbands and Wives, yet he honeſtly ſays it was about the Lawfulneſs of their Marriage, as in <hi>Ezra</hi>'s time, when ſome were commanded to put their Wives away, becauſe their Marriage was unlawful. Now <hi>ſuch,</hi> ſay we, <hi>as is the Sanctification or Holineſs of the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Wife or Husband, is the Sanctification or Holineſs of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65865:75"/>
from hence an External Relative Federal Holineſs, it would follow alſo that the unbelieving Husband and Wife had ſuch an External Relative Federal Holineſs likewiſe, and that would open the ſame Door to baptize the unbelieving Husband or Wife. For may not another Perſon argue thus, The unbelieving Husband is holy or ſanctified by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Wife, and therefore by virtue of her Faith may and ought to be baptized?

And this ſenſe is the more confirmed in that <gap reason="foreign">

And that we are not alone touching this ſenſe of the Words and Matter, pray take the Teſtimony of divers Learned Men, who yet held Infant-Baptiſm, but found this Text remote to the buſineſs of proving it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jerom,</hi> as I find him quoted by a Learned Man, ſaith, becauſe of God's Appointment Marriage is holy.</p>
            <p>See <hi>Chamier,</hi> who ſays, <hi>Sic Ambroſium, Thomam, Anſelmum expoſuiſſe, &amp; tum Suarez appellat literalem ſenſum</hi> That <hi>Ambroſe, Thomas, Anſelm</hi> ſo expounded it, and this <hi>Suarez</hi> calls the literal ſenſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Melancthon</hi> in his Commentary upon this place ſaith thus, <q>Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> anſwers, that the Marriages are not to be pulled aſunder for their unlike Opinions of God. The impious Perſon does not caſt away the other: And for Comfort, he adds as a Reaſon, the unbelieving Husband is ſanctified by the believing Wife. Meat is ſanctified; for that which is holy in uſe, is granted to Believers by God: things prohibited under the Law, as Swines Fleſh, and a Woman in her Pollution, were called unclean. The Connexion of the Argument is this, If the uſe of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ſhould not pleaſe God, your Children would be Baſtards, and ſo unclean; but your Children are not Baſtards, therefore the uſe of Marriage pleaſeth God: and how Baſtards were unclean in a peculiar matter, the Law ſhews, <hi>Deut.</hi>—.</q> Thus far <hi>Melancthon</hi> gives the ſame ſenſe, as <hi>Chamier</hi> obſerves.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Muſculus</hi> in his Comment on the place, confeſſeth that he had formerly abuſed this place againſt the <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Camera</hi> on the place ſaith, <q>[For the unbelieving Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band hath been ſanctified] an unuſual change of the Tenſe, that is, ſanctified in the lawful uſe of Marriage: for without this, ſaith he, it would be that their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould be unclean, that is, infamous, and not legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate; whoſo are holy (that is, during the Marriage) are without all Blot or Ignominy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eraſmus</hi> upon the place ſaith thus, <q>Infants born of ſuch Parents, as one being a Chriſtian, the other not, are le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimately holy; for the Converſion of either Husband or Wife doth not diſſolve the Marriage which was made when both were in Unbelief.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, I find a very learned Divine to affirm, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients expounded this place no otherwiſe. None, ſaith he, <q>that ever I met with expounded it of Federal Holineſs, till the Controverſy of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> aroſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And ſince Mr. <hi>Burkitt</hi> is ſo ingenuous as to confeſs, that the unbelieving Husband is ſanctified in reſpect of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Relation to the Wife in a way of Marriage, in which ſo far he agrees with thoſe Learned Men; this being ſo, how comes he to aſſert 'tis Federal Holineſs that is ſaid to be in the Children?</p>
            <p>And by what we ſay, it appears, it is not a racking of the Scripture o maintain a private Opinion; and tho the word [holy] refers here to what we affirm with others, yet the Apoſtle ſpeaks truly; tho it is granted the Children of Heathens born in lawful Wedlock, are no more Baſtards than the Children of Chriſtians For if the Marriage were made voi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And now to conclude; But if it doth ſignify Holy, as you and your Brethren ſay, why might not the Children of ſuch as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, be ſaid to be holy, as well as the Infidel or unbelieving Wife is ſaid to be ſanctified? What is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween holy and ſanctified?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſays, <q>If the Children of the Faithful are not Members of the Church of God, then they are Members of the Kingdom of Satan, who is the Prince of this World: If they are without the Church, what hopes of Salvation have they? there is no Salvation out of the Church, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I hope my <hi>Antagoniſt</hi> is a <hi>Proteſtant;</hi> but I muſt aſſure my Reader, he here maintains a <hi>Popiſh Doctrine,</hi> which all our worthy <hi>Proteſtant Divines</hi> have proteſted againſt. How! is there no Salvation out of the Viſible Church? God forbid. I doubt not but there are many gracious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who ſhall be certainly ſaved, and who do truly believe in Chriſt, that are not Members of any true Goſpel Church. Will you exclude all from Salvation that are not Members of your Church? I cannot think you own the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be a true Goſpel-Church, and will you exclude all that are of that Communion from the Kingdom of Heaven?</p>
            <p>2. But as to Infants, they are born Children of Wrath, and actually in Satan's Kingdom, till God is pleaſed to ſanctify them; and thoſe who die in Infancy that are ſaved, no doubt he doth ſanctify their unclean Nature, but not ſuch as live and remain in Satan's Kingdom, until they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated by the Word and Spirit of God, after they are grown up to Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>3. Therefore ſome Infants may be Members of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſiole Church, or Myſtical Body of Chriſt, (tho not Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Viſible Church) and of this ſort there may be among the Children of Unbelievers, as well as among the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65865:78"/>
Children of Believers; for the Election of Grace runs not only to the Seed of the Faithful, ſay what you pleaſe, as I ſaid before.</p>
            <p>4. Therefore you do not well to call Children Dogs, if they are not in the Pale of the Viſible Church.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ſay, the Promiſes are the Inheritance of the Church, not to thoſe that are without; and therefore, ſay you, if the Children be without, they are among Dogs, and what Promiſe belongs to them? <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 15. and where there is no Promiſe, there is no hope of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>2. The Promiſes are not the Inheritance of all that are Members of the Viſible Church, for they may not belong to ſome that are in it, and they may belong to ſome others that are not in it. <hi>You darken Counſel with Words without Knowledg.</hi> For, (1.)

No external Privileges, or outward Church-Memberſhip gives any Man a Right to Salvation, nor puts him under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe thereof.</p>
            <p>3. There is hope and ground of hope touching the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of dying Infants, tho they are not in Goſpel-times of the Viſible Church; becauſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>of ſuch belongs the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> But pray, Sir, take heed of what you ſay: You cannot prove that our bleſſed Saviour ſpake thoſe words only with reference to the Children of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. I know no cauſe why unbelieving Parents ſhould doubt of the Salvation of their dying Infants. They may (ſo far as I ſee) have as much ground to hope God's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection may reach their dying Infants, as any Believer can have it may reach to theirs. What if I ſhould exerciſe ſo much Charity as to hope that God hath comprehended in his electing Love all the dying Infants both of Believers and Unbelievers, and that through the Blood and Merits of Chriſt they are ſanctified, and ſhall be all ſaved?</p>
            <p>My Opinion, were it ſo, could not juſtly be condemned by any; but I ſay ſecret things belong to God, and I ſhall
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65865:78"/>
forbear to paſs any Judgment in the caſe, but leave it to God; but I am ſure no Child ſhall be damned for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent's Fault. Can Parents by baptizing their Infants ſave them? Or are they Dogs, and muſt be damned if their Parents baptize them not, and dare not do it becauſe Chriſt hath not commanded them to baptize them?</p>
            <p>4. Sir, what if a Man and his Wife when they were both vile and ungodly People, as bad as any that live on Earth, ſhould beget many Children, and afterwards they both believe and become good Chriſtians, is the State of thoſe Children begotten when they believed good, and they holy? and are the Children they had when they were vile and wicked Perſons, bad, nay ſo bad as they are to be counted <hi>Dogs?</hi> O that God would open your Eves! Nay, if it were as you intimate, it may be queried, Whether it be not a ſinful, a wicked, and an unlawful thing for two ungodly, unbelieving, unfaithful Perſons to marry, ſince they can beget no Children but ſuch as you call <hi>Dogs;</hi> for you will not ſay their Children are holy, or ought to be baptized, nor are in the Pale of the Church.</p>
            <p>But to conclude with this Chapter; let me ſpeak a word to you that are Believers, and alſo a word to you that are Unbelievers, and I ſhall paſs to the next Argument.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To you that are Believers and have Children; if they are holy and Heirs of Heaven, as they are begotten and born of your Bodies, as Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> and other <hi>Pedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi> aſſert, then you need not trouble your Thoughts about your dying Infants, tho they are not baptized; for 'tis not Baptiſm makes them holy, by Mr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s Conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but becauſe they are your Children; 'tis by your Faith they are holy, as he blindly ſuppoſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And ſince Baptiſm doth not belong to them, Chriſt no where having commanded you to baptize them, nor can it add any thing to their Salvation; I charge you in the Fear of God baptize them not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But do not believe Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> nor any other Man in what he ſays, unleſs he can prove it from God's Word. I tell you from Chriſt's own Words you have ground of hope touching the State of your dying Infants, but not becauſe they are your Children, but becauſe <hi>of ſuch belongs the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and they may be in God's eternal Election of Grace: For, as Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> ſaith, and I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, God may have many ways to apply the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65865:79"/>
Blood of Chriſt to ſave and ſanctify dying Infants, which we know not of; but we are not any more required to haptize them, or to give them one Sacrament, than we are required to give them the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Lord's-Supper;</hi> and this he will one day know to be a Truth, tho now he ſees it not.</p>
            <p>
               <q>O! ſaith Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> caſt them not out from the Church of God, out of the Covenant of Salvation; they are your dear Children, Children of your Bodies, of your Vows. O, ſhew them the Mercy of God! the Church of God is willing to receive them: O rent them not from the Myſtical Body, of which they are Members.</q> See <hi>pag.</hi>—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> You Godly Parents take heed what Doctrine you receive, you cannot caſt your Infants out of the Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and Myſtical Body of Chriſt, if they are in it, nor caſt them out of the Covenant of Salvation: No, no, that's not in the Power of Mortals: We cannot receive them or bring them into the Covenant of Salvation, nor make them Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt's Inviſible and Myſtical Body. None can do that but God himſelf, Chriſt himſelf; 'tis prepoſterous Stuff, ſtrange Doctrine this <hi>poor Man</hi> troubles you with. Good Men may in ſome things be blinded and miſled: Try his Doctrine, ſearch the Scriptures, take nothing upon truſt without trial.</p>
            <p>As to your bringing of your Children into the Viſible Church, ſo as to be Members thereof, and to have right to the holy Sacraments, they muſt come in at the Door of Regeneration, not by Generation; even at the ſame Door you came in at if you are true Members thereof: and O therefore pray for your Children, they are dear to you, bring them up in the Fear of God, command them to ſeek after the Knowledg of their Natural State, and to know and believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and ſet them a good Example. I know not what better Counſel to give you concerning your Children.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To you that are Unbelievers who have Children. Do not fear the State of thoſe dear Babes of yours that die in Infancy, you have no cauſe to doubt of their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but your Children may be ſaved that die in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, as well as the Infants of faithful and godly Parents. Alſo the Infants of Godly People are no more holy than yours, if your Marriage was good and lawful; for Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65865:79"/>
is honourable in all; it belongs to Unbelievers, and is God's holy Ordinance to them as well as 'tis to Believers. But O let it be your Care and chief Buſineſs to get true Faith in Jeſus Chriſt; for Matrimonial Sanctification in your ſelves, or the Holineſs of Legitimation in your Children will add nothing to yours or their Salvation; but till you and your Off-ſpring do believe and are ſpiritually holy, and ſanctified by the Blood of Chriſt, through Faith of the Operation of God, neither you nor they have any right to the Sign, which is Baptiſm: for as we deny the Infants of Believers, as ſuch, have any right to Baptiſm, ſo be ſure your Children have no right thereto; yet the Promiſe is to you and your Children, or Off-ſpring, whenever the Lord is pleaſed to call either you or your Children by the preaching of the Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Proving, in Oppoſition to what Mr. <hi>James Owen</hi> ſaith, that Children have no right to be baptized, altho Chriſt bleſſed them.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>MR. <hi>Owen</hi> quotes <hi>Mark 10. 13, 14, 15, 16. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Saith Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> 
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>Let us conſider in this remarkable Scripture who were thoſe that were brought to the Lord Jeſus; the Text ſays they were little Children, ſuchas were taken up in Arms, as we tranſlate the word <hi>

                  </hi> therefore, ſaith he, it being evident that thoſe Children brought, as it is probable, by the Godly Parents unto Chriſt, were very little, they themſelves were not of Age to come unto him, nor profeſs Faith in him.</p>

                  </gap>hriſt to bleſs them, ſo do we bring them to Chriſt by Baptiſm to receive a Bleſſing. Why cannot they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Bleſſing from him now, as in the days of his Fleſh? Are his Bowels ſtraitned towards them?</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> What doth this prove touching the Lawfulneſs of Infant-Baptiſm? we acknowledg and readily grant that they were little Children that were brought to Chriſt, and that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> his Hands upon them, and bleſſed them; but is this a Warrant for us to Baptize our little Children?</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <q>You ſay, Chriſt prayed for them whom the Father had given him, <hi>John</hi> 17. 9. and if the Children of the Faithful not of the World, but are Chriſt's, we ſhould
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65865:80"/>
ſuffer them to come to him, and receive his Mark which is Baptiſm.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Are all the Infants of Believers given unto Chriſt, and ſo not of this World? Do you believe it? Sir, <hi>all that the Father hath given to Chriſt, ſhall come unto him,</hi> and every Soul of them ſhall be ſaved. Now do all the Children of the Faithful come to Chriſt, and ſhall they all be ſaved? or are you not to be rebuked and ſharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for what you write, to blind the Eyes, and deceive the Children of the Faithful, to make them think their State is good and ſafe, when perhaps they are in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and Bond of Iniquity? Had not <hi>Abraham</hi> an <hi>Iſhmael, Iſaac</hi> an <hi>Eſau,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> an <hi>Abſalom?</hi> O, and what ungodly Perſons do daily ſtill proceed from the Loins of Godly Parents! And how gracious do many Children of wicked Parents prove when grown up!</p>
            <p>2. You know not whether theſe little Children were the Children of Godly Parents or not, nor who they were that brought them to Chriſt; their Parents might be ungodly as far as we know, and yet ſome of their Relations, Kindred, or Neighbours might believe that Chriſt would bleſs them, and heal them; therefore they might bring them to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>3. You ſay Baptiſm is Chriſt's Mark; but I have ſhewed the fooliſhneſs of that Aſſertion: Baptiſm is not diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mark that God's Children have on them, but his Mark and Seal is his holy Spirit, and his holy Nature or Image ſtampt upon the Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <q>4. You ſay, that Chriſt was very angry with his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples for forbidding little Children to come unto him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> From hence we may gather, it was not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their Maſter that they ſhould be baptized, or come that way unto him; for if it had, beſure the faithful Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of our Lord would not have once attempted to forbid them to be brought to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it is thought the Reaſon why the Diſciples forbid them to bring little Children to our bleſſed Lord, might be, left by their crying they might diſturb him, for that we ſee little Children in a Croud of People are ſubject to do.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> By this you ſeem to intimate, that all Infants are in Covenant with God; for, I ſay again, you cannot prove that theſe little Children were Children of faithful and holy Perſons. However I will add here what I have ſaid in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Mr. <hi>Burkitt</hi> on this Argument, to which, or any other of my Anſwers he hath not attempted to give any Reply; but, as I am inform'd, is reſolved to let it reſt in ſilence, and write no more on the Subject. Take his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from this Text, which is in ſubſtance the ſame that you further inſiſt on about Chriſt's Bowels and Love to thoſe little Children.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If Infants, ſaith he, be capable of Chriſt's Bleſſing on Earth, and of his Preſence in Heaven; if they be Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his Kingdom of Grace, and Heirs of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Glory; then they have an undoubted right to the Privilege of Subjects, among which the Seal of the Covenant is not the leaſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We anſwer, and argue thus to the firſt part of the Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In many of the Jews and others who were ungodly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, were capable of Chriſt's Bleſſings, <hi>i. e.</hi> of being healed of their Bodily Diſeaſes, they were Subjects of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: Is this ſound arguing? What farther Bleſſing Chriſt vouchſafed to Infants, when he laid his Hands upon them, we know not, for that was the way Chriſt took oftentimes in the healing the Sick, and ſo bleſſed many Perſons that never were baptized, as we read of.</p>
            <p>2. We (as I have before told you) do deny Infants are Subjects of the Viſible Church; therefore if by the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Grace any intend not that, <hi>they beat the Air:</hi> Alas! ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o arguing beg, and prove not; beſides, it doth not follow, I ſay again, tho Infants may be Heirs of the Kingdom of Glory therefore they have an undoubted right to the Privileges of the Subjects of God's Church; for then it would follow they have right to one Privilege as well as to another, and <hi>are to have Fellowſhip with the Saints and Houſhold of God,</hi> as well as Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>Mr. Burkitt argues further thus, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Thoſe whom Chriſt invites to him, and are received by him, his Miniſters may not refuſe, nor put from them: But In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re by Chriſt invited to him, and were received by him, therefore the Miniſters of Chriſt may not, ought not, durſt not refuſe them into Communion with them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:65865:84"/>
Take my Anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Chriſt invited Multitudes to come unto him, and he received them ſo far as to feed them with Barley-Loaves and Fiſhes, and to the Bleſſing of healing them of their Bodily Diſtempers: But may his Miniſters therefore receive all ſuch into their Communion?</p>
            <p>2. In the days of Chriſt when he was upon Earth, there were many who are ſaid to come unto him, whom he might receive into his Preſence and Company, yet his Miniſters might not baptize them, nor receive them into their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Communion; nor indeed you dare not ſo receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, I mean into your Communion of the Lord's-Supper. We read of ſome Phariſees and Lawyers that came to Chriſt, and he received them into his Company, who, it appears, came to tempt him. Alſo the Sadduces are ſaid to come unto him, who ſaid there was no Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; may Chriſt's Miniſters baptize ſuch, and receive them into their Communion? Therefore in Oppoſition to what Mr. <hi>Burkitt</hi> ſays in his Book, I affirm, there were then other ordinary ways of coming to Chriſt than by Admiſſion into his Church: <hi>Chriſt invited the worſt of Sinners unto him,</hi> who nevertheleſs did not receive him. Therefore there are ſome who muſt be excluded whom Jeſus Chriſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly inviteth.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Burkitt</hi>'s Appeal for Proof of this Argument to St. <hi>Mark 10. 3. Suffer little Children to come unto me, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> doth not his Buſineſs; they do not belong to the Kingdom of Grace, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Church; for if they did belong to that, or were of the Viſible Church, as ſuch, then he need not by Baptiſm make them belong to it. If Chriſt owns them Subjects or Members of his Viſible Church, then Pedo-baptiſts need not add them thereto by Baptiſm: For if, as they are the Seed of Believers, they are already <hi>(fide foederis)</hi> not only in Covenant with God, but alſo belong unto his Kingdom or Church upon Earth, all the World may ſee that Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kitt</hi> goes about to give them that very Right or Privilege which they had before and without Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Doth Chriſt (ſaith he) take Children into his Arms, and ſhall his Church caſt them out of her Imbraces?</q>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> May I not argue thus, <hi>i. e.</hi> Doth Chriſt receive all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons into his Arms of Mercy, to heal their Bodily Diſtempers, of which perhaps ſome were wicked and ungodly? And
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:65865:85"/>
ſhall the Church refuſe to receive all ſuch into her Imbraces? Beſides, all thoſe pretended Conſequences make no more for Infants to be baptized, than for their receiving the Lord's-Supper, and all other Privileges that belong as well as Baptiſm to Adult Perſons who believe or are Diſciples.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Does Chriſt, ſays he, own them for Subjects in his Kingdom, and ſhall we allow them no better ſtanding than in the Devil's Kingdom?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Does Chriſt own Infants to be Subjects of his Kingdom, and yet did not baptize them? (for that he did not) and ſhall we attempt to baptize them, as if we were wiſer than he? I muſt again turn the Edg of the Sword upon this Man: If little Children were brought to Chriſt and he did not baptize them, then we muſt not; But little Children were brought to Chriſt and he did not baptize them, therefore we muſt not. Here is both Truth and Reaſon in this Argument, as Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> confeſſeth, but none of either in his.</p>
            <p>It is confeſſed by Mr. <hi>Burkitt</hi> himſelf, That Chriſt did not baptize thoſe Infants that came to him, and whom he took in his Arms and bleſſed, becauſe with his own Hands he baptized none at all, <hi>John</hi> 4. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſince Chriſt who was God, foreſaw what <hi>Contention</hi> would ariſe about the baptizing of Infants, had it been his Will they ſhould be baptized, would he not at this time put the Matter out of doubt, and have baptized them, or have given Command to his Diſciples ſo to have done?</p>
            <p>If therefore Infants be in ſo good a Condition as he ſays, <hi>i. e.</hi> Subjects of Chriſt's Kingdom of Grace, let us let them alone, for we cannot by baptizing them put them into a better State than they are, without any Warrant from Chriſt; and by baptizing them not, we cannot put them into any worſer State or Standing than they are in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
            <p>Many Pedo-baptiſts are angry with us, becauſe we ſay we know not but that the Children of. Unbelievers and <hi>Infidels</hi> may be in a good Condition as well as Children of Believers, tho we deny not but that the Children of Believers have a greater Advantage than the Children of Unbelievers namely, by the Prayers, good Education, and the good Example of their Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:65865:85"/>
But ſaith Mr. <hi>Burkitt,</hi> 
               <q>Can any wiſe or good Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that our Saviour would ſpeak ſuch favourable words of Infants, and his outward Geſture manifeſt ſo much good Will towards them, only with an Intent to enſnare and deceive us? doubtleſs it was to encourage his Miniſters to perform all charitable Offices towards them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. He miſtakes, our Saviour ſpeaks very little concerning Infants, and that which is ſaid of them was accidentally ſpoken, being occaſioned by thoſe who brought little Children to him, <hi>which the Diſciples forbad,</hi> and from hence he ſpoke what he did. Moreover, the cauſe why our Saviour ſpoke thoſe words, might be more for the ſake of Parents, that they might not be afraid touching the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their dying Babes, than to ſhew any Ordinance belonged to them; for had it been ſo, doubtleſs the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples would not have for bad thoſe People to bring little Children to Chriſt. 'Tis therefore an Argument againſt Infant-Baptiſm, and not for it, becauſe the Diſciples were appointed by their Maſter to be the Adminiſtrators of that Ordinance on ſuch to whom it did of right belong; and had Infants been the Subjects, would they have forbid Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to bring Infants to him?</p>
            <p>2. We therefore may rather conclude, had they been the Subjects of Baptiſm, Chriſt, by not hinting any ſuch thing in the leaſt on this occaſion, might rather have left us in a Snare, in ſpeaking nothing of it neither here nor at any other time.</p>
            <p>3. Therefore Chriſt ſpeaking ſo favourably of Infants, and yet baptizing them not, may teach us to judg favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of them, and do any charitable Office towards them, but not to preſume to give them holy Baptiſm without Chriſt's Warrant no more than any other Goſpel-Ordinance. 'Tis no matter what <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpoke, 'tis no Sin to keep ſuch out of Chriſt's (viſible) Fold, whom he has given no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to take in: Nor have any People a more charitable Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the State of dying Infants than thoſe ſtil'd <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Thoſe who are capable of ſome kind of Bleſſings of Chriſt, we have ſhewed, are notwithſtanding not capable of Baptism. We read not the Diſciples baptized theſe little Children, nor any elſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:65865:86"/>
               <hi>Object.</hi> To this he, as you do, anſwer, Perhaps they were baptized before: But, ſays Mr. <hi>Burkitt,</hi> it doth not follow, that the Apoſtles did not baptize thoſe Children, becauſe no mention of it: The Scripture no where tells us that the Apoſtles themſelves were baptized; ſhall we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore they were never baptized?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis no matter whether we read or read not, that the Apoſtles were baptized, ſince we find it was Chriſt's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and Practice to baptize Diſciples, or ſuch who did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him: We read of multitudes of Diſciples, that were baptized, and we know the way of Chriſt was one and the ſame; that which was the Duty of one Diſciple, as a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was the Duty of every Diſciple. We read but of two or three Churches who broke Bread, or celebrated the Lord's-Supper. Could any Pedo-baptiſt but ſhew us a Precept for Infant-Baptiſm, or but one Example or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent where one Infant was baptized, we would not doubt but thoſe little Children might be alſo, but this they cannot do.</p>
            <p>And whereas Mr. <hi>Barkitt</hi> and you ſay, <q>That there is not the ſame Reaſon why Infants ſhould be admitted to eat the Lord's-Supper, as there is for them to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Baptiſm.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer; We deny it utterly. What tho the one be a Sacrament of Initiation, and the other of Confirmation? Yet pray obſerve, that Repentance and Faith is required of them that are to be baptized, even actual Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, as well as actual Grace and Examination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to diſcern the Lord's-Body, in thoſe who are to receive the Lord's-Supper. If all that were to be circumciſed, had been required to repent and believe as in the caſe of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to Baptiſm, ſomething had been ſaid, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary appears. Male-Infants, as ſuch, had a right to that, but have no ſuch right to this.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ſay, Chriſt did not lay his Hands upon little Children to heal them of Sickneſs, becauſe the Apoſtles would not have been ſo cruel as to hinder them to come to Chriſt to heal their Diſtempers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Is it then greater Cruelty to hinder little Children of the Bleſſing of being healed of Bodily Diſeaſes, than to hinder them of Convenant-Bleſſings, Spiritual Bleſſings? How abſurdly do you argue!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:65865:86"/>
You add alſo, <q>Chriſt baptized them not at that time; for, ſay you, they were baptized before by <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and Chriſt laid his Hands upon them to bleſs them; ſay you, <hi>laying on of Hands followed Baptiſm, Acts 8. 17. Heb.</hi> 6. 2. many of the Anti-pedo baptiſts own it, for they lay their Hands on thoſe they baptize, you ſay rebaptize.</q> 
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We rebaptize none: Rantiſm is not Baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but you ſhould firſt prove <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> did baptize any Infants, for that you have not done, nor ever can do. We ſhall ſee what Proof you have for what you ſay by and by. As to laying Hands on baptized Believers, the Scriptures you mention prove that an Ordinance of Chriſt, but not upon Infants; the Apoſtles never taught or practiſed any ſuch thing, tho 'tis true 'tis a <hi>Popiſh Rite:</hi> for as the Baptiſm of Believers is corrupted and changed to Infants, ſo laying on of Hands on baptized Believers is corrupted and changed by the falſe Church to Infants alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ſay, The Kingdom of God under the Goſpel is made up of Children, and of ſuch that are like to them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If by the Kingdom of God you mean the viſible Church, 'tis utterly denied; when you write again prove it, that the viſible Church under the Goſpel is made up of Infants, tho we deny not that the Goſpel Church is made up of ſuch, who like little Infants are <hi>meek, humble</hi> and <hi>harmleſs</hi> Perſons; in Malice all Believers ſhould be as little Children.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>In Anſwer to Mr. <hi>James Owen's 9th</hi> Chapter and ſixth Argument; proving, that Infants ought not to be baptized, although the Gentiles were grafted into the true Olive, when the Jews were broken off; containing a true Expoſition of <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 15, 16, &amp;c.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>ROM. 11. 15, 16, 17. <hi>For if the firſt Fruit be holy, the Lump is alſo holy: and if the Root be holy, ſo are the Branches. And if ſome of the Branches be broken off, and thou being a wild Olive Tree, wert graffed in amongſt them, and with them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takeſt of the Root and Fatneſs of the Olive-Tree,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In this remarkable Scripture the Apoſtle, you ſay, ſheweth,</p>
            <q>
               <p n="1">1. That the Jews, while they were God's viſible Church, were a holy Nation; not only the Parents, but the Children alſo, all the Branches were holy, becauſe the Root was holy; the Root was <hi>Abraham,</hi> and others of the Fathers, <hi>Rom. 11. 28. Iſa.</hi> 51. 1, 2. becauſe they were in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant, the Parents and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were holy, being ſeparated a peculiar People unto God: In this ſenſe they were holy; becauſe the firſt Fruit, even <hi>Abraham,</hi> was holy, the whole Lump alſo was holy. <hi>Abraham</hi> believed and received God's Covenant to him and his Seed, being the firſt Fruit of the Jews: even as the firſt Fruits offered to the Lord, <hi>Levit.</hi> 2. 3, 9, 10, 17. ſo did the Faith of the firſt Parents ſanctify the whole Nation of the Jews, not with true Holineſs in the Heart, for many of them were wicked, but with a federal Holineſs, becauſe they and their Seed were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated to the Lord in an external Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You ſay; They that received the Goſpel conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to be holy Branches upon the ſame holy Root; they and their Seed were in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant, even as
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65865:87"/>
before, nor one Branch was cut off, neither ſmall or great, until they refuſed the Lord Jeſus, they that were broken off were cut off by reaſon of Unbelief, <hi>Rom. 11. 20. Becauſe of their Unbelief they were broken off;</hi> therefore they that believed in Chriſt were not cut off, and if they were not cut off, then they were in Union with the Root, as being Partakers of the Fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Root, as before they and their Children were Partakers of their old Privileges, being holy Branches not broken off. The Anti-pedo-baptiſts do cut off the Branches whom God never cut off, <hi>viz.</hi> the Seed of the Faithful; they lop off the fruitful Tree in the Vineyard, and lay the Ax upon the Root, and upon the Branches thereof in a preſumptuous manner.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You ſay the Jews refuſed the Grace of God in the Goſpel; God refuſed that Nation, not only the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents but the Children alſo. God ſpared not the Natural Branches, but hath broken them off, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17. not from the inviſible Church, of which the unbelieving were not Members. None are Members of the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church ſaving the Elect. God refuſed none of the Parents, <hi>Rom. 11. 2. 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 9. God hath not caſt away his People which he foreknew; the Foundation of God ſtandeth ſure: therefore they were cut off through Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief from being the viſible Church, of the which they and their Children were Members.</p>
               <p>The Gentiles, were graffed in their room, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17. they and their Children were broken off, and the Gentiles and their Children ſhall be graffed in, for they were received into the ſame Privileges which the Jews had—the ſame Privileges belong unto them in the ſame Latitude, for they were graffed into that Root from which the Jews were cut off, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer; you had need be a good Expoſitor of a Metaphorical Place of Scripture, that ground ſo great an Argument upon it; we uſed to ſay Metaphors ſerve for Illuſtration, but are not Argumentative, they do not prove a Truth, tho they may illuſtrate it; therefore 'tis ſtrange you build an Inſtitution, an Ordinance, nay a Sacrament, as it is called, upon a Metaphorical place of Scripture.</p>
            <p>2. Many things in <hi>Metaphorical</hi> and <hi>Parabolical</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture run not parallel with that they are brought to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65865:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
illuſtrate, therefore run not on <hi>all four,</hi> as Divines ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
            <p>3. We will however examine your pretended Argument from this myſterious place of Scripture. It was well if you had minded what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks in the <hi>25th</hi> Verſe, <hi>For I would not, Brethren, that you ſhould be ignorant of this great Myſtery, leſt ye ſhould be wiſe in your own Conceits,</hi> &amp;c. But that you are ignorant of this myſterious Text, and Matter contained in it, I doubt not but to make appear, and it is to be feared from thence you are wiſe in your own Apprehenſion. But to proceed, if all the Branches, <hi>viz.</hi> the Children of the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were holy, then the Children of the unbelieving Jews were holy alſo, who were of that Lump you ſpeak of; and if ſo, why do you argue from hence for the federal Holineſs of the Children of Believers? Sir, under the Law there was a Federal and Typical Holineſs, but the Children of Godly Parents now, or the whole Lump, you ſay, is holy, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> tho not ſpiritually holy, yet federally holy, becauſe all that were in that exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Covenant and Church-ſtate of the Jews were holy. If by Federal Holineſs, which was in the Jewiſh Church, you mean no more than external Church-Memberſhip, not ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Holineſs and ſpiritual Privileges, then their Loſs by being cut off is not ſo great as the Apoſtle intimates, nor is the Fatneſs of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant and true Olive ſo ſweet as you elſewhere affirm, nor is it ſo great a Bleſſing for the Gentiles to be graffed into ſuch a Root or Olive-Tree that affords no better Oil. What ſignifies Federal External Holineſs without true Spiritual Holineſs? it will do us nor our Children no more good than the ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, Federal or Covenant Holineſs did do to the wicked Jews and their Children under the Law, no nor ſo much neither; for they had by that external Covenant many Earthly or External Bleſſings, as they were poſſeſſed by that Covenant of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and Common-wealth of the Jews, as a National Church; which external Privileges believing nor unbelieving Gentiles and their Seed have not under the Goſpel, therefore that is not true which you affirm, <hi>viz. The ſame Privileges belonging to the Gentiles and their Children, in the ſame Latitude, for they were graffed into the ſame Root.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:65865:88"/>
Sir, have we Gentiles a Worldly Sanctuary, a holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Temple, a Land flowing with Milk and Honey, a Political Government and Governours from among our ſelves as we are a Goſpel-Church by God's Ordination, as the Jews had? Are we under the Promiſes of heaping up Gold and Silver, and if we are obedient to live in Peace, and to be ſaved from our external Enemies, for many ſuch like Privileges and Promiſes the Jews and their Children had under the Law? The truth is, your External, Federal Holineſs, Root and Olive-Tree will-afford but little Fatneſs either to our ſelves or Children, conſidered diſtinct and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from Spiritual Bleſſings and Holineſs. What is a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple external Profeſſion good for, without true Grace and a ſaving Intereſt in Chriſt, and Aſſurance of Eternal Life? What more doth it ſerve to do than to blind and deceive the Souls of ſuch external and carnal Profeſſors? What is an Ordinance without the God of the Ordinance? What is the Sign without the Thing ſignified? What is the Lamp with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Oil, or a Cabinet without the Jewel, or a Shell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Kernel, or the Name of a Chriſtian without the true Nature of a Chriſtian?</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ſay, The firſt Parents ſanctified the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jews, not with true Holineſs in the Heart, for many of them were wicked, but with a Federal Holineſs, becauſe they and their Seed were ſeparated to the Lord in an External Covenant.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I am glad to ſee you open the Eyes of your People, now they may ſee what little good that federal Holineſs, and the Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> can do to their Infants, 'tis but only to give them a Name that they may be called Chriſtians. Is this the Promiſe that belongs to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and their Children? Is this the Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> that is come upon the Gentiles? Are they not Spiritual Bleſſings? Is it not Spiritual and Heart-Holineſs? Is it only to be in an external manner, by an external Covenant, and viſible Profeſſion, ſeparated to be the Lord's, and called his, when indeed and in truth, ſpiritually and ſavingly they are not ſo? Is this that Covenant confirm'd by the Oath of God, that gives you ſuch ſtrong Conſolation touching your Infants, as ſuch, as before you pleaded for?</p>
            <p>4. Moreover, do you not own by what you here affirm, that there were two Covenants made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſince that Covenant which was made with the whole Lump, or
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65865:89"/>
whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was, as you poſitively aſſert, not a ſpiritual but an external Covenant? Sure I am you do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there was a ſpiritual and an eternal Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and all his true ſpiritual Seed, and that he was a Root ſpiritually holy, by virtue of that ſpiritual and true Goſpel-Covenant God made with him; and as the whole Lump were all federally holy in a Spiritual Senſe, as himſelf was, and as he had firſt Fruits given to him, who were ſpiritually and truly holy alſo, ſo there are many Branches ſtill that daily ſpring out of that Spiritual Root and Spiritual Covenant, that are federally and ſpiritually holy as the Root was holy. Sure there was a Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of which he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a common Root, or common Head, and from which Root and Olive-Tree it is impoſſible any one of his Spiritual Seed can be cut off; for if not ſo, <hi>How is the Promiſe ſure to all the Seed?</hi> Rom. 4. 16. and how is that Covenant a ground of ſtrong Conſolation to all the Heirs of the Promiſe? as <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>5. But the truth is, the purport of your Expoſition of this dark Text, all may ſee is to prove the Goſpel-Church to be as extenſive, wide and large, or every way of the ſame Nature and Latitude with the National Church of the Jews; and therefore you plead for the Fleſhly Seed, as ſuch, to be received as Members thereof.</p>
            <p>Sir, I know you not, but I thought you had held for the Congregational Way; but the truth is, Infants Church-Memberſhip is only calculated for a National Church, and therefore beſt ſutes with Presbyteriſm and Epiſcopacy.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ſay, the Jews and their Children were broke off, and the Gentiles and their Children were received into the ſame Privileges which the Jews had, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. If you would prove that the Goſpel-Church is National, conſiſting of whole Pariſhes, Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and Kingdoms, you muſt bring Proof for this Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution from the New Teſtament: Show, where Chriſt inſtituted or ordained ſuch a Church-ſtate, or what whole Gentile Nations, conſiſting of Believers and their Children, and Unbelievers or ungodly Perſons profeſſing Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and their Children, were conſtituted by the Apoſtles a Goſpel-Church; for evident it is, all believing or godly Jews and their Children, and all ungodly Jews who owned the Jewiſh Religion, and their Children, were
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65865:89"/>
Members of the National Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the Law.</p>
            <p>2. Alſo prove, that if ſuch a Goſpel-Church Conſtitution can be proved out of the New Teſtament, that therefore all the external Privileges and Rites of the Jews, muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto ſuch a Gentile Nation, and Goſpel-Church, that did belong to the National Church of the Jews. Muſt they have the ſame Rites and Privileges, and yet not the ſame? Is Baptiſm Circumciſion?</p>
            <p>3. If it came, as you dream, in the room of it, then it would follow that Baptiſm belongs only to Male-Infants; if not ſo, 'tis not the ſame Privilege, but differs greatly: you muſt have therefore ſome word of Inſtitution, or ſome good Authority from Chriſt to enlarge this Privilege, ſo far as to allow it to Females alſo.</p>
            <p>4. And why this Privilege only? had not the Jews and their Children many other external Privileges beſides Circumciſion? Why muſt not the Gentiles and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that are grafted in, as you ſuppoſe, in their room, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all the Privileges as well as one or two? You have done your Work by halves.</p>
            <p>5. Beſides, what you ſay, that the firſt Parents ſanctified the whole Nation of the Jews, is falſe. It was not they that ſeparated or ſanctified them but God himſelf, <hi>i. e.</hi> by his abſolute Command and holy Inſtitution; therefore you muſt prove the like Command and Inſtitution for ſuch a National Church under the Goſpel as was under the Law. Sir, I deſire no better Task than to prove the Goſpel-Church conſiſts of none, by Chriſt's Appointment and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, but only Adult Perſons believing and profeſſing Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, incorporated together in a holy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. And when you write again, lay down your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to confute what I here ſay, and I ſhall, God ſparing my Life, be ready, through his Aſſiſtance, to give you an Anſwer, which will utterly throw away your Infant Church-Memberſhip. And ſince the old Covenant, and old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Church-ſtate is taken away and diſſolved, by the eſtabliſhing of the Goſpel-Covenant, and Goſpel-Church, you muſt bring your Arguments and Proof from Chriſt's laſt Will and Teſtament, or all you do will ſignify no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

falſe, and inconſiſtent with the Truth as it is in Jeſus, I ſhall give thee my Thoughts of the true Purport of it; and in regard I have once done it already in my anſwering of Mr. <hi>Burkitt,</hi> I ſhall proceed to lay down his Argument and my Anſwer, and that will bring me to the Buſineſs directly. The Argument which Mr. <hi>Burkitt,</hi> and with him other Pedo-baptiſts, raiſes to maintain their Scriptureleſs Practice of Babes-Baptiſm from this Text, is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If (ſaith he) the Infants of Chriſtian Parents are fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derally holy, then they are Subjects qualified for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: But the Scripture pronounces ſuch Children fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally holy; therefore they are qualified for Baptiſm, and may be admitted, <hi>Rom. 11. 16. If the Root be holy, the Branches are alſo holy,</hi> &amp;c. Where by the Root, ſaith he, we are to underſtand <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and by the Branches, their Poſterity, the People of the Jews. Now foraſmuch (ſaith he) as the Jews, the Natural Branches, are for their Unbelief broken off, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentiles are graffed in their ſtead, and ſucceed in their Privileges, in the ſenſe that they were holy, not with an internal and inherent Holineſs, paſſing by Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Generation from Parent to Child, but with an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Relative Covenant-Holineſs, grounded on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to the Faithful and their Seed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I deny the <hi>Major,</hi> and ſay, If Children of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers were federally holy under the Goſpel, yet they are not qualified for Baptiſm, becauſe 'tis not that which gives them right thereto, or qualifies them for it, but what Chriſt hath ordained and appointed, as the alone proper and meet Qualification, which is not that <hi>External, Relative Covenant-Holineſs</hi> he talks of, which the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament ſpeaks nothing of, as I ſhall ſhew by and by, but <hi>actual Faith, Regeneration, or inherent Holineſs,</hi> which is the Thing ſignified by Baptiſm; therefore a thouſand ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments will do no good, ſince Baptiſm <hi>is of meer Poſitive Right.</hi> 'Tis Chriſt's own Law muſt decide the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, <hi>viz.</hi> What Qualifications are required of ſuch, who by his Authority and Law ought to be baptized. Let any Pedo-baptiſt prove, if he can, that ſuch an <hi>External Fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Holineſs</hi> qualifies any Perſon for Goſpel-Baptiſm; for if ſuch Federal and External Holineſs qualifies Perſons for Baptiſm, then the Jews, before caſt off, might have been admitted to Baptiſm, ſince they had then ſuch a kind of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65865:90"/>
Federal Holineſs, which kind of Holineſs none can prove Believers Children are ſaid to have under the Goſpel; but if it qualified them not for Baptiſm, it cannot qualify our Children for Baptiſm: And that it did not qualify them, is evident, ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 9. where ſome of the Branches of this Root came to <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> to be baptized, and he refuſed to admit them, with theſe words, <hi>i. e. Think not to ſay within your ſelves, We have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father: For I ſay, God is able of theſe Stones to raiſe up Children to</hi> Abraham. Ver. 10. <hi>And now alſo is the Ax laid to the Root of the Tree.</hi> From whence it plainly appears, that that <hi>External Relative Holineſs,</hi> which qualified under the Old Teſtament Perſons for Circumciſion, and Jewiſh Church-Memberſhip, will not qualify Old nor Young under the New Teſtament for Baptiſm, and Goſpel-Church-Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>2. I alſo deny his <hi>Minor,</hi> and ſay, the Scripture of the New Teſtament doth not pronounce the Children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Parents federally holy: The Text <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. ſpeaks not one word of Infants, nor one word of ſuch a kind of federal Holineſs. Dr. <hi>Thomas Goodwin,</hi> who was a very Learned Man, urging that Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. (tho a <hi>Pedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt) In the New Teſtament</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there is no other Holineſs ſpoken of, but Perſonal or Real by Regeneration;</hi> about which he challenged all the World to ſhew to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>And Sir, with your favour, if you cannot from any place of the New Teſtament prove there is any ſuch Holineſs ſpoken of, you are to be blamed for bringing in a private and an unwarrantable Interpretation of that Text. I find there are various Interpretations of what is meant by the Root in that place.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Some underſtand it of the Covenant.</item>
               <item>2. Some of Chriſt.</item>
               <item>3. Some of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. Some of <hi>Abraham</hi> only.</item>
            </list>
            <p>What if I agree with the laſt, and ſay <hi>Abraham</hi> is the Root? But what Root? why, the Root of all his true Spiritual Seed: And if ſo, the Holineſs of the Branches was real in word and ſpiritual; for ſuch Holineſs as is in the Root, is in the Branches: and indeed for want of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65865:91"/>
Faith, or of that Real and Spiritual Holineſs in many of his Natural Branches (for he was a twofold Root, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as I have before proved) they were rejected or broken off for their <hi>Unbelief,</hi> and the Gentiles by <hi>Faith</hi> were graffed in, they having obtained the Fatneſs of the Root, or the Faith and Righteouſneſs of their Father <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who was the Root or Father of all that believe. The truth is, as Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> obſerves, <q>The Holineſs here meant is, firſt, in reſpect of God's Election, <hi>Holineſs</hi> perſonal and inherent in God's Intention, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4. Secondly; It is alſo Holineſs derivative, not from any <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> but <hi>Abraham,</hi> not as a Natural Father, but as a Spiritual Father, or <hi>Father of the Faithful;</hi> and ſo derived from the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And thus it appears you have darkened this illuſtrious Scripture, thinking to prove a Holineſs that the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament knows nothing of, applying the <hi>Holineſs</hi> in the Text to Federal Relative, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Holineſs in reſpect to outward Diſpenſation only in the viſible Church, which is meant of ſaving Graces, into the inviſible, and make every believing Parent alike Head or Root to his Poſterity with <hi>Abraham</hi> to his Seed, which we deny.</p>
            <p>But let the Jews Covenant and Standing before they were broken off be what it would, I am ſure no Gentile is graffed into Chriſt, but by actual Faith; nor can any be graffed into the Goſpel Church without the Profeſſion of ſuch Faith, therefore you do but beat the Air.</p>
            <p>The Jews, 'tis true, were broken off by their Unbelief, and were alſo no more a Church; nor is there any ſuch kind of Church conſtituted under the Goſpel as theirs was, <hi>viz.</hi> a National Church; for they amongſt the Jews, who were the true Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> receiving Chriſt by Faith, were planted into the Goſpel Church, and between them and Gentile Believers: Now there is no difference, Jew and Gentile ſtand in the Church now by Faith, not by external Covenant, Privilege, Right or Holineſs. Thou ſtandeſt by Faith, O Believer, Mark! not by Birth-Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, but by Faith (ſaith one) yet not thy Seed by thy Faith, but thou thy ſelf by thine, and they by their own: Faith is that by which thou ſtanding (and not thy Seed) haſt right to ſtand in the Church, and not they: But if thy Seed have Faith, and thou haſt none, then they have right in the Church, and thou ſhalt be excluded. And tho under the Law we
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65865:91"/>
deny not, but that the Natural Seed or Progeny of <hi>Abraham</hi> were all holy, with an External, Ceremonial or Typical Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; and conſequently they were admitted to an external Participation of Church-Privileges; yet now 'tis otherwiſe, <hi>old things are paſt away: now we know no Man after the Fleſh,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 16. That Church-ſtate is diſſolved, and manner of Admiſſion into it, by external Birth-Privilege, and that this Text doth not help you. I ſhall further open this place of Scripture.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis evident the Apoſtle is in the <hi>9th</hi> and <hi>10th</hi> Chapters to the <hi>Romans</hi> treating of the Election of Grace, and of that Covenant of Grace God made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> theſe were his People which he had not caſt away, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 1. and of this ſort God had 7000 in <hi>Eliah</hi>'s days, <hi>ver. 4. Even ſo,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>at this preſent time alſo there is a Remnant according to the Election of Grace,</hi> ver. 5. Hence he ſays, <hi>What then?</hi> Iſrael <hi>hath not obtained,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but the Election hath,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 7. He further ſhews, that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> were broken off. How are they broken off? Why by their Unbelief, they not receiving Chriſt, but rejecting the Goſpel and new Church-ſtate, were broken off. But that the Gentiles might not boaſt over them, the Apoſtle ſhews there is ground left to believe all thoſe that belong to the: Election of Grace, ſhall in God's due time be brought in, and ſo partake of the Bleſſings of the Goſpel-Covenant, or Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> and to prove this, in <hi>ver.</hi> 16. he lays down an Argument, <hi>For if the firſt Fruit be holy, the Lump is alſo holy; and if the Root be holy, ſo are the Branches,</hi> ver. 16. by the Root I underſtand is meant <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Root and Father ſignifying here the ſame thing, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> being the Root or Father, as God repreſents him, of all the Elect, or of ſuch who believe, or the Root of all his true Spiritual Seed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the firſt Fruits may be meant <hi>Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> and the Holy and Elect Patriarchs, for they were given as the firſt Fruits to <hi>Abraham</hi> of that Covenant and free Promiſe of God, and theſe were holy, with a true Spiritual and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal New-Covenant Holineſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By the Lump he may mean the whole Body of the Elect, or the Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> from the time the firſt Fruits were given him, until the Goſpel-day, or whole Body of the true <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, who were holy, as the Root and firſt Fruits were holy.</p>

4. By the Branches, may be meant the true Elect Seed that were living then in that preſent time, as <hi>ver.</hi> 5. and theſe were holy too, even as all the reſt, both as the Root, Firſt-fruits and whole Lump or Body were holy: That is, all the true Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> were like himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> holy in a ſpiritual ſenſe. And now obſerve, he ſpeaks of ſome Branches that were broken off; theſe ſeemed to be Branches, or the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo they were according to the Fleſh, but were like thoſe Branches in Chriſt who bear no Fruit, and therefore taken away, <hi>John</hi> 15. 2, 3, 4. he alludes to the Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom he ſtood not as a Spiritual Father, or Root, but as a Natural and Legal Father, as they were a National Church, and ſprung from him; and theſe Branches were all broken off, <hi>viz.</hi> for rejecting Chriſt. (1.) Not broken off from the Election of Grace, for to that they did not belong. (2.) Nor were they broken off from the Goſpel-Church, for they were never graffed into that. But, (3.) broken off from being any more a Church or People in Covenant with God, the whole old State and Conſtitution being gone; and they not cloſing in with Chriſt in the Goſpel Diſpenſation, Grace and Church-ſtate, are ſaid to be broken off as a loſt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, becauſe not replanted or implanted into Chriſt, and the true Goſpel-Covenant; the old being gone, quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved and taken away, they have now no Root to ſtand upon, having loſt their Legal Privileges as <hi>Abraham</hi> was their Father, upon that foot of Account, and they not appearing to be the true Branches or Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as he was the Father of all the Elect Seed, or of all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Jeſus Chriſt, they muſt of neceſſity from hence be broken off from being the People of God, or belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any Head or Root, in any Covenant-Relation to God at all, the Diſpenſation being changed, <hi>Old things being gone, and all things being now become new.</hi> But theſe new State-Bleſſings, Rights, Church and Church-Privileges are rejected; and thus were ſome of the Natural Branches broken off, and the Gentiles, who were wild by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>i. e.</hi> never were in any viſible Church ſtate with God, nor in any ſenſe related to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as a Root, were graffed into the true Olive Jeſus Chriſt, and into the true Goſpel-Church, and ſo Partakers of the Sap and Fatneſs of the Root, and of the Olive, that is, of the Spiritual Bleſſings and Privileges of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of the Covenant
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65865:96"/>
of Grace made with him, and of the ſweet Bleſſings and Privileges of the Goſpel Church; and this they receive and partake of, as being firſt graffed by ſaving Faith in Chriſt, and ſo united to his Myſtical Body. But ſince there are a greater Number of the old Natural Branches that are beloved for their Father's ſake, that is, for the ſake of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the Roo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And if this be conſidered, what doth this Text do to prove the Natural Seed of Believers, as ſuch, are in the Goſpel-Covenant? for if the Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> can lay no Claim, not have any right to Goſpel-Privileges, but are gone or broken off, what ground is there for us to think that on Natural Off-ſpring, (as ſuch) ſhould be taken in? The Apoſtle ſpeaks not of ſuch Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>s, or of being holy with an excernal federal Holineſs, but of ſuch a Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as was in the Roo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>viz Abraham,</hi> who believed in God; and thus all his true spiritual Seed (who are actually Branches and in Goven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, being grafted into Chriſt by Faith) are holy; and alſo all the Elect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> not yet called, are decretively, of in God's ſight ſo, who calls things that are not, as if they were; they are all holy and beloved for their Father <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſake, with whom the Covenant of Grace was for himſelf, and all his true Spiritual Seed. And 'tis from this Argument the Apoſtle argues for the calling of the Jews, and the graffing of them in again, who belong to the Election of Grace; they therefore who would make every believing Parent to be the Root to his Natural Off-ſpring, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was to his true Spiritual Seed or Off-ſpring, or a common Head or Root of their Natural Off-ſpring, as he was to his, know not what they ſay or affirm; for then there would be ſo many common Roots and Fathers, like as <hi>Abraham</hi> was called a Root and Father; and then alſo there would be a Knowledg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Moreover, the Jews who were broken off, are ſtill the Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and if therefore this Holineſs was an External Relative, Federal Holineſs, they are in that ſenſe holy as much as any Children of a believing Gentile can be ſaid to be; but this, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65865:97"/>
is not that Holineſs of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, nor is there any ſuch Holineſs under the Goſpel-Diſpenſation ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>Thus, Reader, I have examined Mr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s Expoſition of this Text, and have found it to be a falſe Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and a palpable Abuſe of the ſacred Text, and have opened the Text, I hope, truly. It therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows from what I have ſaid in Oppoſition to what Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith in the Cloſe of the ninth Chapter, as here followeth:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That by the Natural Branches that receive Virtue and Fatneſs from the Root before Chriſt came, were not meant the Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as ſuch, becauſe no ungodly Perſon did, or doth, or can receive the Virtue and Fatneſs of the true Olive-Tree, or ſaving Bleſſings of the Covenant of Grace God made with <hi>Abraham.</hi> What Virtue or Fatneſs is in a ſimple, external, federal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion or Holineſs, either in the Jewiſh or Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as it reſpects only a Separation to viſible Church-Memberſhip?</p>
            <p n="2">2. It appears alſo that the Jews that believed in Chriſt, tho they were not broken off of the Covenant of Grace God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet they and their Children ſtood no longer in that Legal and External Covenant of Peculiarity which God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but that that old Covenant is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That thoſe Jews that believed not, and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, are broken off from being any more in any Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Relation to God as his People, and that for their Unbelief.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It alſo appears that none of the Gentiles are received or graffed into Chriſt, and into the true Olive, or into the Covenant of Grace God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> but only ſuch that believe; not them and their Fleſhly Seed, as ſuch, but they themſelves and their Children alſo that do believe, even none but ſuch who by Faith partake of the Fatneſs; that is, the beſt of Bleſſings that appertains to the Covenant of Grace, not external Bleſſings and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges only: no, no, they are not the Fatneſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> the beſt and the choiceſt of Covenant-Bleſſings, but Union with Chriſt, Juſtification, Pardon of Sin, Adoption and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65865:97"/>
Life; in theſe things conſiſts the Fatneſs of the true Olive, which Believers Seed, as ſuch, partake not of, nor any but the Elect and called ones of God, according to his Eternal Purpoſe only.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It alſo appears, that thoſe Jews that ſhall be called and graffed in again into their own Olive-Tree, ſhall be none but the Elect, and that their own Olive-Tree doth not refer to the external Privileges of the Covenant of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity God made with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Natural Seed, as ſuch, but ſhall receive of the Fatneſs of their own Olive-Tree, which is the Covenant of Grace; for that primarily was made with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Natural Seed, that believe, and belongs to all God's Elect alſo as their own and proper Olive, whether Jews or Gentiles. So that when the Jews are called, we may be ſure they will plead no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Privileges of their old diſſolved Covenant, but come in upon the Terms of the Goſpel, with their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that believe and none elſe: And if the Controverſy of Infants right to Baptiſm and Church-Memberſhip ceaſeth not till they ſhall be called and come in, who will then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the old Federal Right, and all Old Teſtament ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Privileges, be ſure it will ceaſe then.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Your firſt Argument hath as much in it for the baptizing of Infidels and their Children, as for the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Believers, for do not they need pardoning Grace?</p>
            <p>2. As to your ſecond Reaſon, Do all the Children of Believers that die go to Heaven? and do none of the Children of Unbelievers go thither? Dare you affirm, that all Unbelievers Children that die are damned? if not, why may they not be baptized as well as the Children of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
            <p>3. But do you baptize no Children of Believers but ſuch that die? do not many of them live and prove ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when grown up, that you baptize?</p>
            <p>Two things you muſt prove, if you ſay any thing here to the purpoſe.</p>

               <q>(You ſay) God can easily give holy Qualities to the Souls of Children: Cannot God reſtore his own Image to little Children?

till they die? <hi>Worthy Britains!</hi> ſee here Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> does acknowledg that the Infants of Believers, as ſuch, are not in Covenant, for all that are in the Covenant of Grace and have a right to the Seal of it are regenerated; alas, what is the Seal but a Seal of Regeneration, and ſo of eternal Salvation! <hi>Epheſ. 1. 13, 14.

            <p>
               <q>But (you ſay) In others Regeneration appears very early, day by day, that is in ſome little Children.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. But are not ſome Children of ungodly Parents as early wrought upon and born again as the Children of the godly, why then may not their Children alſo be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized? You ſay Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> in his Book called, <hi>Tears of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> ſpeaks of two <hi>Indian</hi> Children who were converted before three Years old: Sir, theſe were not the Children of Godly Parents.</p>
            <p>3. Admit that to be true, and that God ſometimes doth regenerate Children at three or four Years of Age.</p>
            <p>Such Children I can baptize by the Authority of Chriſt's Commiſſion, or by Virtue of his holy Precept, and none but ſuch Children that do believe have any right thereunto. <hi>You ſay</hi> Solomon <hi>was very young when the Lord loved him.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>In a word, that which renders Perſons capable of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm are the Prerequiſites of Baptiſm, or thoſe things that are required by Chriſt to be in the true Subjects thereof, which are Faith and the Profeſſion of it, or Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. You may be capable of being made a Justice of Peace, but you muſt not exerciſe that Office without a lawful Commiſſion: So let our Children be capable of what they will or may, yet without a Warrant from God's Word they ought not to be admitted to Baptiſm, the Lord's Supper, nor to any other Goſpel-Ordinance.</p>
            <p>God can give ſacred Habits and Qualities to a Child we deny not, but till he doth it you are not to give them the Signs of thoſe gracious Qualities; and if there be no viſible Signs or Demonſtrations of thoſe ſacred Qualities in ſuch Infants you baptize that render them Believers, 'tis at beſt but a mock Baptiſm.</p>

Moreover, you may infer as well that Unbelievers, yea the worſt of Men and Cattle alſo, ought to be baptized under the Goſpel, becauſe <hi>Noah</hi> and his Children were baptized in the Ark, among which was curſed <hi>Chan:</hi> you intimate that <hi>Cham</hi> was baptized upon his Father's Faith; ſo that it appears the Father's Faith will not only ſave the Infant-Seed of Believers, but ſave them when they are Adult Perſons alſo.</p>
            <p>But were not the Beaſts and the Fowls baptized and ſaved by the Ark as well as <hi>Noah</hi> and his Children, and his Son <hi>Cham?</hi> But as touching that Text 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10. how the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> might be a Figure of Baptiſm, I ſhall ſpeak to that more fully by and by.</p>
            <p>3. Becauſe all ſorts of Waſhings or Dippings are in the Greek Tongue Baptizing, doth it therefore follow that all ſorts of Baptiſms, Dippings, or Waſhings, are formally Chriſt's Ordinance of Baptiſm?</p>

               <item>3. The Element in which the Party is baptized muſt be Water.</item>

            <p>Now, Sir, was there any Perſon either young or old, before the Law or under the Law, thus baptized?</p>
            <p>
               <q>(You ſay) that <hi>Jacob</hi> received little Children into God's Covenant by Baptiſm, becauſe he ſaid unto his Houſhold, <hi>Put away the ſtrange Gods that are among you, and be ye clean, and change your Garments?</hi> Gen. 35. 2.</q>

2. What tho the Hebrew word ſignifies cleanſing or waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Water, was it therefore formally the Ordinance of Baptiſm?

            <p>
               <q>But (you ſay) Circumciſion was abominable in the ſight of the Gentiles, becauſe the Children of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> made it to be an Ordinance of Mortality unto the <hi>Sichemites, Gen.</hi> 34. and the greateſt part of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Houſhold were Gentiles, therefore <hi>Jacob</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Wives and Children into God's Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant through waſhing of Water, or Baptiſm; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Example of <hi>Jacob</hi> they uſed to baptize all the Gentiles that received Circumciſion; for their wise Men ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If this be ſo, that the Baptiſm of Children was among the Jews, or in the Jewiſh Church from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, why do you plead for Baptiſm to come in the room of Circumciſion? it appears your Infant-Baptiſm is near or altogether as old as Circumciſion it ſelf, therefore it could not come in the room of that.</p>
            <p>2. I have read, I muſt confeſs, in ſome Authors, that the Jews did receive their Proſelytes both by Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Baptiſm; but you ſeem to intimate that <hi>old Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> was ſo wiſe to diſmiſs Circumciſion to his Gentile Proſelvtes.

I muſt confeſs <hi>Jacob</hi> had many Failings, but I never heard him thus charged, and rendered guilty of ſuch an Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before.</p>
            <p>How, Sir! could he lay aſide God's holy Ordinance of Circumciſion at his Will and Pleaſure, and that too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Sons had brought a Reproach upon it; and did he deviſe a new Ordinance, namely Baptiſm, in its room? What an abominable Innovation had he been guilty of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65865:102"/>
ſhould he have done this thing, which you ſeem poſicively to affirm?</p>
            <p>3. Nay, and this is not the worſt of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Sins nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for it appears by your plain words, that you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the Jews from this Example of <hi>Jacob,</hi> uſed to baptize all the Gentiles that received Circumciſion, tho it appears the Jews did not follow the Example of <hi>Jacob</hi> in throwing Circumciſion away, and exchange it for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, yet by <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Example did baptize all their Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Proſelytes, whether Men, Women and children; ſo that he cauſed them to ſet up, or add a Tradition of his own deviſing to God's Inſtitution: For I challenge you or any Man under Heaven, to prove that God commanded <hi>Jacob</hi> or any <hi>Patriarch,</hi> or Jewiſh Rabbies, to baptize any Proſelyte either young or old when received into their Church.</p>
            <p>4. Behold, you <hi>Pedo-baptiſts,</hi> the Riſe and Foundation of your Infant-Baptiſm according to Mr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s Conceit! Why? where have we it, even in <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, wherein the whole World were baptized! For let me thus argue, If all the World in <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark both rational and irrational Creatures were baptized, then Infants may be baptized. nay and all Unbelievers, and Cattel alſo; but the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is true, <hi>Ergo.</hi> But if we have not the Riſe of it here. we have in <hi>Gen. 35. 2. Then ſaid</hi> Jacob <hi>unto his Houſhold, and unto all that were with him, Put away the ſtrange Gods that are among you, and be you clean, and change your Garments.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Pray take the Conſequence or Inference from hence ('tis better perhaps to prove Infant-Baptiſm, than from those whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Jacob</hi> commanded all his Houſhold, and all that were with him to be baptized, among which were Gentiles and their Children, therefore we Gentiles and our Children may be baptized. Yea, and our Men-Servants and Maid Servants, tho they be <hi>Negro's,</hi> whether they believe or not; for <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> perhaps had ſome groſs Idolaters in his Houſhold, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

the worſt of Men as well as little Children may be baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Honoured Britains!</hi> you have ſeen but little of this Controverſy in your Language: But Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> ſeeing the old Argument; which the Aſſerters of Infant-Baptiſm have brought, to be too weak to eſtabliſh it to be of God, and from Heaven, out of the New Teſtament; he hath found out new ones never heard of by me before, I mean this of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s commanding his whole Houſhold, and all that were with him, to be clean, that is, ſaith he, to be baptized all of them. So that Infant-Baptiſm hath its Riſe not from the Command of Chriſt, but from the Command of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and that not from Circumciſion, for <hi>Jacob</hi> laid that aſide becauſe his two Sons had cauſed Circumciſion to be odious and hateful to the Gentiles, he therefore contrived Baptiſm in its ſtead. O when will this Man ceaſe to pervert the holy and righteous way of God in his Inſtitution of Believers Baptiſm!</p>
            <p>6. I find alſo that Mr. <hi>James Owen</hi> hath found out the firſt Riſe or Original of that human Tradition of the Jews in baptizing their Gentile Proſelytes, both Men, Women and Children. But I am very ſorry it is fathered upon holy <hi>Jacob</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Burkitt</hi> I muſt confeſs makes that Cuſtom that was among the Jews a grand Argument for Infant-Baptiſm; and, as if the New Teſtament without the Old was not a ſufficient Rule for the Practice of Goſpel-Baptiſm, but that we muſt have recourſe to the Old Teſtament as well as the New.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer; That tho in ſome Points of Faith and Practice the Old Teſtament and the New together is the Rule by which we ought to walk, yet his Trumpet and yours in this caſe gives an uncertain Sound: For in reſpect of Practice, were there not many Laws and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts given to the People of the Jews, which no ways in the leaſt concerns us or God's Spiritual <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the Goſpel? If you explain your ſelf no better, you may ſoon ſubvert the People, and carry them away to <hi>Judaiſm</hi> with a witneſs; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y and inſtead of baptizing Children upon ſuch a Childiſh and Erroneous foot of Account, make them think they ought to circumciſe them, as ſome of late here in <hi>England</hi> were deluded to do. Therefore
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65865:103"/>
we ſay, as to all Precepts of the Goſpel that are meer poſitive Laws, the New Teſtament is our only Rule with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Old. Chriſt alone is our Law-giver, and him and not <hi>Moſes</hi> we are only to hear and hearken unto; tho as to matter of Faith the Old Teſtament may be uſeful to us in many reſpects, and alſo all Precepts that are purely Moral in their own Nature; The Old Teſtament is a Rule to us as well as the New, which I might ſhew in many reſpects, not only touching the Law of the Decalogue, but alſo about days of Prayer, ſinging God's Praiſes, Faſting-days, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But for any to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate in the Caſe of Baptiſm, that the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a Rule of Practice, or in reſpect of Jewiſh Church-Memberſhip, ſuch ſtrangely betray their Ignorance, as will further appear hereafter. For that Circumciſion was a meer Legal or Jewiſh Rite, I ſhall evidently anon fully prove.</p>
            <p>You and Mr. <hi>Burkitt,</hi> with other Pedo-baptiſts, affirm,<q> that ſo little is ſaid in the New Teſtament about baptizing Infants, becauſe the Cuſtom of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them was common, and the Practice conſtant in the Jewiſh Church, at and before our Saviour's time. Whilſt Circumciſion was the covenanting Sign, Baptiſm was the purifying Ceremony among the Jews; for when any of the Gentiles were admitted into the Jewiſh Church, both Parents and Children were firſt circumciſed, and then waſhed in token of cleanſing them from the Filth of their Heatheniſm: So that Baptiſm among the Jews conſtantly went along with Circumciſion till our Saviour's time.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis a ſign of a bad Cauſe when Men are forced to try their Wits after ſuch a ridiculous manner to make out what they have to prove. Pray, was that Cuſtom among the Jews of baptizing Infants, when any of the Gentiles were admitted into the Jewiſh Church, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God? Had God given the Jews any ſuch Law or Precept? Or was it one of their own Traditions, who in their own Wiſdom, without any Warrant from their great Prophet and Law-giver, deviſed that Ceremony, poſſibly to waſh away the Filth of Heatheniſm, as your Predeceſſors in like manner, without any Command or Warrant of Jeſus Chriſt, deviſed the baptizing of Infants
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65865:104"/>
to waſh away the Filth of Original Sin? Doth not our bleſſed Saviour ſay that <hi>they had made void the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God through their Traditions?</hi> I do affirm, it was never given them as a Law or Precept by the great God, nor do you attempt once to prove any ſuch thing; for there is not the leaſt ſhadow of any ſuch thing in all the Old Teſtament, therefore it was a meer Human Tradition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Can any wiſe Man who would do nothing in God's Service without a ſufficient Rule or Warrant from the Word of God, think this a good Argument for Infant Baptiſm?

Sure the Authority of the latter is as good as the former.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But is it ſo indeed, did our Saviour ſay nothing of Infant Baptiſm? or, as you hint, leave ſo little of it in the New Teſtament, becauſe it was the conſtant Cuſtom among the Jews to baptize the Children of Heathens before they admitted them into their Church? What Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, Taylor,</hi> and <hi>Lightfoot</hi> have ſaid upon that account, is to their Shame and Reproach rather than to their Honour, tho I know it was their laſt Refuge, when they ſaw your Scripture-Proofs would not prove it to be a Truth of Chriſt. O how are we beholden to the Jewiſh Talmud and J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wiſh Rabbins for our Infant-Baptiſm! Nay, which is worſt of all, how is Chriſt beholden to them for that rare Invention, who had ſaid ſo much for it, and made it ſo common a Practice among them, that it ſaved him the Pains to give the leaſt Directions about it?
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65865:104"/>
But is not this next to Blaſphemy? Can any Man in his right Wits think our Lord Jeſus ſhould confirm a Tradition and Innovation of the Jews? Or take his great Ordinance of Baptiſm from the Superſtitious, Fabulous and Erroneous Cuſtom of their Doctors and Rabbins? Beſides, was Baptiſm to be preached or practiſed by none but the Jewiſh People? Doth it not belong to the Gentiles too? Did not our Saviour command his Diſciples to go into all Nations, and make Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and baptize them? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Was it in his Mind that Infants ſhould be baptized, and yet ſay nothing of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was a common Cuſtom and Practice among the Jews? But, pray, what muſt the Gentiles do to know this to be their Duty? (I mean thoſe Gentiles who received the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith) <hi>viz.</hi> that they ought to baptize their Children who did not know, nor ever heard of that Jewiſh Cuſtom? Or dare you ſay our New Teſtament is not authentick, or ſufficient to teach us the whole of Goſpel-Duties, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, without the Jewiſh <hi>Talmud?</hi> You ſhould not ('tis plain) only have ſaid the New Teſtament is not without the Old the Rule of our practice; but alſo that the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and the Old, without the Jewiſh <hi>Talmud,</hi> is not ſufficient, and then you had done your Buſineſs at once. VVhy are not Men aſhamed thus to go about to blind and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the poor People?</p>
            <p>Is not the whole Mind of Jeſus Chriſt, even all his Laws and Precepts, or his whole Counſel, plainly contained in his Bleſſed VVord? But would you have People be wiſe above what is written, and teach Men to reflect upon the Care and Faithfulneſs of the Bleſſed Jeſus, in leaving out of the Sacred Bible one great Truth of God, and leave us to find it out by going to ſearch the Jewiſh Tradition?</p>
            <p n="4">4. If it was a Cuſtom among the Jews, it muſt be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Cuſtom, I mean a Cuſtom that God appointed and commanded them to obſerve, or elſe a Human Tradition or vain Cuſtom: And if it had been a Moſaical Rite, given by God himſelf to the Jews, Chriſt then be ſure aboliſhed it, and nailed it to his Croſs, with all its Fellows, and 'tis gone for ever, ſince he hath not given it out a new.</p>

For the <hi>Talmud</hi> is called a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth of Errors, and the Foundation of Jewiſh Fables; it was brought to Perfection, and held for authentick five hundred Years after Chriſt: Therefore it is unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65865:105"/>
to reſt upon the Teſtimony of it. And that which moves me moſt, <hi>Joſephus</hi> (to omit all the Fathers that lived before the <hi>Talmud</hi> was finiſhed) who was a Jew, and a Contemporary with Rabbi <hi>Eliezar,</hi> who alſo wrote in particular of the Rites, Cuſtoms and Acts of the Jews, is altogether ſilent in this Matter. So that it is an Argument to me, next to a Demonſtration, that two ſuch Eminent Perſons, both Jews, and living at the ſame Time, the one ſhould poſitively deny, and the other make no mention of Baptiſm among the Jews. Beſides, if Baptiſm, in the Modern Senſe, were in uſe among the Jews in Antient Times, why did the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees ask <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, <hi>Why doſt thou baptize if thou art not Chriſt, nor</hi> Elias, <hi>nor that Prophet?</hi> Do they not plainly intimate that Baptiſm was not in uſe before, and that it was a received Opinion among them, that there ſhould be no Baptiſm till either Chriſt, or <hi>Elias,</hi> or that Prophet came?</q>  So far Sir <hi>Norton Knatchbull,</hi> in his Notes printed at <hi>Oxford, Anno Dom.</hi> 1677. with the Licence of the Vice-Chancellor, a very Learned Man, and a Son of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Sir, What think you now of your Jewiſh Cuſtom of baptizing the Heathens, and their Children, who were admitted to their Church? Do you think there was not need that Infant-Baptiſm ſhould be mentioned in the Holy Scripture, had it been a Truth? Is this uncertain Story of the Jewiſh Cuſtom ſufficient for you to build your Faith and Practice upon, when the Truth of the Story, as to Matter of Fact, may juſtly be doubted? But if it was true, it is but a rotten Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to build one of the great Sacraments of Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> a vile, profane and Human Tradition of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Rabbins.</p>
            <q>
               <p>You ſay, The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and their Children were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the Cloud, and in the Sea, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2, 3. That <hi>Iſrael</hi> going under the Cloud, and through the Sea; that was, ſay you, a Baptiſm unto them: The Cloud rained upon them, and the Sea dropped upon them, which was as a High Wall round about them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Baptiſm under the Cloud, and in the Sea, ſignifyeth, in its Eſſence, the ſame thing with the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65865:106"/>
Bleſſings: The Spiritual Waſhings in the Sea, and the Spiritual Drink from the Rock, ſignified the ſame thing; even Chriſt he was the Subſtance of all the Types under the Law. The Pillar of Cloud, and the Pillar of Fire, did foreſhew the Baptiſm of Water, and the Baptiſm of Fire, or of the Holy Spirit; the falling of the Water from the Cloud, ſignified the pouring of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> Two Things are to be done to diſprove what you ſay here.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That the Rain falling from the Cloud, was not that which was the Figure of Baptiſm.</item>
               <item>2. That this Text doth not prove Infants to be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Baptiſm.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> If Perſons may be ſaid to be baptized when it rains upon them, How many times have you and I been ſo baptized? Beſides, Do you think it never rained upon the <hi>

                  </gap>ites</hi> before they paſſed through the Sea?</p>
            <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> Prove if you can it did then either rain upon them from the Cloud, or that the Sea dropped upon them; 'tis but your own ungrounded Suppoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Prove that Rain falling upon them, can in any Senſe be called a Waſhing or Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>Therefore let the Reader conſider well what our Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators ſpeak on this Place; ſee Mr. <hi>Pool</hi>'s <hi>Annotations</hi> on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2, 3. <q>Others, ſaith he, more probably think that the Apoſtle uſeth this Term, in regard of the great Analogy betwixt Baptiſm, (as it was then uſed) the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons baptized going down into the Waters, and being dipped in them, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> going down into the Sea, that great Receptacle of Water; though the Water at that time was gathered on Heaps on either ſide of them, yet they ſeemed buried in the Water, as Perſons in that Age were when baptized.</q> Thus ſpake your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren who compleated Mr. <hi>Pool</hi>'s <hi>Annotations.</hi> They tell you in what Senſe the Fathers were ſaid to be baptized unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the Sea, and under the Cloud. Here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ſprinkling, pouring, or raining on them; but they
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65865:106"/>
were, as it were, buried in the Sea, and under the Cloud; and ſo it repreſents Immerſion or Dipping, which is Chriſt's true Baptiſm. We are buried (not ſprinkled) with Chriſt in Baptiſm, both in the Sign and alſo in Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; to ſhew he was dead, buried, and roſe again for us, and that we are dead to Sin and ought to walk in New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life.</p>
            <p>But do not miſtake, the Fathers being ſaid to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Sea, and under the Cloud, was no real, but Typical Baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Place proves not that Infants are the Subjects of Goſpel Baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis ſaid all our Fathers were baptized, but 'tis nor ſaid their Children were baptized unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Sea, and under the Cloud.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <q>2. But you intimate, there were many Children with them as they paſſed through the Sea.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, ſo there were many wicked Men alſo; all the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were not godly Perſons, but many among them were prophane and ungodly People: Beſides, there was a mixt People paſſed through the Sea with the Fathers alſo, may be ſome of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and others of other Nations, and much Cattle alſo; and theſe were all baptized as truly as were the little Children.</p>
            <p>May we baptize ſuch therefore? we have as much ground from hence to baptize ſuch, as you have to baptize your Babes, nay more ground, if the Rain falling upon the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> was that which baptized them; 'tis a Queſtion whether any Rain might fall on little Babes, if it fell on their Parents, for the Parents might cover them by holding ſome thing over their Heads and Bodies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſame Perſons which the Apoſtle ſaith were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the Sea, and under the Cloud, are alſo ſaid <hi>to eat the ſame Spiritual Meat, and to drink the ſame Spiritual Drink.</hi> Now did not the Children partake of the Lord's Supper, I mean that Typical Lord's Supper? This Text therefore proves as ſtrongly that you may give them the Lord's Supper as Baptiſm, becauſe they ate of the <hi>Manna</hi> that fell from Heaven, and drank of the Water that came from the Rock.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The deſign of the Apoſtle here is, to forewarn the Saints at <hi>Corinth</hi> to take heed leſt they fell as the Fathers
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65865:107"/>
fell in the Wilderneſs; and to caution them the more effectually, he ſhews them that the Fathers who fell (not the Children) in the Wilderneſs, had like great Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with them, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Typical Baptiſm,</hi> and alſo a <hi>Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Lord's Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore nothing of this matter concerned their little Babes, nor ours neither. As to what you ſay of whole Houſholds being baptized in the New Teſtament in this Chapter, I ſhall refer my Anſwer to that Chapter of yours where you particularly inſiſt upon that weak Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ſay, the Parents and their Children were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, by giving of the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> Exod. 19. 10. <hi>Go to the People, and ſanctify them, and let them waſh their Clothes.</hi> Now the waſhing of their Clothes and the waſhing of the Fleſh went together, <hi>Lev.</hi> 15. 5, 6. waſh his Clothes, and waſh himſelf in Water. Being thus waſhed, the Apoſtle ſaith, that all the People entred into God's Covenant by Baptiſm, Heb. 9. 19. <hi>For when</hi> Moſes <hi>had ſpoken every Precept to the People according to the Law, he took the Blood of Calves and of Goats, with Water, and ſprinkled both the Book and the People.</hi> The Apoſtle calls this Sprinkling, Baptiſm, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. divers Baptiſms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw</hi> I anſwer, you have once already to your great Reproach, and I fear contrary to the Light of your own Conſcience, aſſerted that which is falſe; I appeal to you, and all that can read the Greek, whether that word in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>? Speak and confeſs your Ignorance, or elſe acknowledg your Sin in going about to deceive the People, by making them believe that ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is in Greek Baptiſm or baptizing: For tho waſhing in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. is Baptiſm or baptizing, yet in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 19. ſprinkling both the Book and People, you muſt needs know is in the Greek rantizing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And what tho theſe divers waſhings are called Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms, I have ſhew'd once already from a Faithful and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:65865:107"/>
Learned Author, namely Mr. <hi>Henry Ainſworth,</hi> that all thoſe Legal Waſhings were by total dipping of the whole Body.</p>
            <p>Take his Words again on <hi>Levit.</hi> 11. 32. <q>All that are unclean, whether Men or Veſſels, are not cleanſed but by dipping or baptizing in Water; and whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Law ſpeaketh of waſhing a Man's Fleſh, or waſhing of Clothes for Uncleanneſs, it is by dipping the whole Body therein: and whether they be Men or Veſſels, there may not be any thing between them and the Water, to keep them aſunder, as Clay, Pitch, or the like, that cleaveth to the Body or Veſſel; if there be, then they are, ſaith he, unclean, and their waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profiteth them not. <hi>Maim Mikvaoth, chap.</hi> 1. § 12, 21.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Take heed what you affirm for the future: This Man, you and all know, was well acquainted with Jewiſh Rites and Ceremonies; and what can be a more full Confutation of what you affirm of Jewiſh Waſhings or Baptiſms? But where we read of ſprinkling of Blood and Water, 'tis not baptizing, unleſs baptizing and rantizing be both one and the ſame Word, and Thing, which we utterly deny.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What tho the People were waſhed, even all the whole Congregation, Was not that a Typical Church, and did it not typify that all true Believers muſt be waſhed in the Blood of Chriſt in Juſtification, and alſo waſhed by the Holy Spirit in Sanctification? Theſe Things were held forth thereby, and not Baptiſm. You would make one thing that is a Figure or Shadow, a Type of another thing that is alſo it ſelf but a Shadow or Figure; for Baptiſm ſignifies Chriſt's Death, Burial, and Reſurrection, and our Death unto Sin, and Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a new Life. But thoſe Types were Shadows of good things to come, even of Chriſt, he was the Subſtance of them all; they muſt I ſay prefigure a Subſtance, not a Shadow.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In a word, all your labour is here loſt about thoſe divers Legal Baptiſms and Rites under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and of Children being in that Covenant, becauſe they were all Types; even that all the Elect, or all that believe in Chriſt, ſhould be waſhed in Chriſt's Blood, or
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65865:108"/>
have his Blood ſprinkled upon them, and be ſanctified by his Spirit: Alſo it was a legal external and Typical Covenant, and an external Typical Church, holding forth the true Spiritual Goſpel-Church; and that, like as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion and thoſe divers waſhings, did belong to the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whether Godly or not.</p>
            <p>So all the true <hi>Iſrael,</hi> under the Goſpel Diſpenſation, ſhould have the Subſtance and Anti-type of them; and when any have attained to Faith in Chriſt, and have what is ſignified in Baptiſm, then and not till then they ought to be baptized: but this not ſimply becauſe they are in Covenant, or have the thing ſignified in Baptiſm, but becauſe of the expreſs and poſitive Command of Chriſt. I ſay again, nothing can give being to an Ordinance that wholly depends on a meer poſitive Rite, but the expreſs Will and Command of the Law-giver.</p>
            <p>To conclude with this, I infer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the whole, in Oppoſition to what Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith, it plainly appears that the ſprinkling of VVater is not Baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That God receives all into the Covenant of Grace and Goſpel Church, through the Spiritual waſhing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation and Sanctification of the Spirit; and that ſuch only by Chriſt's poſitive Command ought to be baptized.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That there was no Goſpel-Baptiſm, no Baptiſm of Chriſt under the Law, but that 'tis a pure poſitive Command and Inſtitution of our Lord Jeſus in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That God received none of his People under the Law into Covenant, through Baptiſm, or through ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Water and Blood: And that the ſprinkling of Blood was a Figure of the Atonement of Chriſt's bloody Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and the ſprinkling of Water of the ſanctifying Virtue of the Spirit in Sanctification, and not that Goſpel-Baptiſm was ſignified thereby.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That 'tis only the meer poſitive Command of Chriſt in the New Teſtament, that gives being, and a juſt Right, to Goſpel-Baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That tho the Children with their Parents were taken into the Legal or Typical Jewiſh Church, by God's poſitive Command, that being a National and Typical Church, yet no Children or Parents are by the poſitive Command of Chriſt in the New Teſtament to be received into the Goſpel-Church,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65865:108"/>
but only thoſe of them that believe and are waſhed in the Blood of Chriſt, and ſanctified by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Water of the Holy Ghoſt; ſith the Church of God now is not National, but Congregational, not conſiſting of the Fleſhly, as ſuch, but the Spiritual Seed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſince there being no Precept nor Precedent in all the New Teſtament, that any one Infant was baptized or taken into the Goſpel-Church, it follows 'tis an Human Tradition.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That the Covenant on <hi>Sinai,</hi> and the Ceremonial Law, was not the Covenant of Grace, tho given in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency thereunto, and the latter a clear Figure of the Covenant of Grace, and held it forth to all ſuch who by Faith could ſee beyond thoſe Sacrifices to the Anti-type of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith, <q>If Children were baptized formerly into Covenant, ought they not to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into his Covenant now, eſpecially becauſe the Grace of the Covenant being enlarged under the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the Goſpel, and the Privileges being more extenſive?</q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, He doth but beg the Queſtion, aſſerting that which he proves not, nor is ever able to prove, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That Children were baptized into the Covenant under the Law; What <hi>Pedo-baptiſt</hi> ever aſſerted this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? And in vain doth he affirm it now, eſpecially ſince he cannot prove ſprinkling is Baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That all Infants were received into Covenant with God by Legal ſprinkling, and not till then; but certainly all the Infants of the Jews were born Members of that National Church, therefore not received into that Church and Covenant by Circumciſion (which moſt of the Aſſertors of Childrens Baptiſm do affirm); much leſs not by ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Blood and Water upon them: Yet that ſprinkling of Blood and Water might, I deny not, be a Sign that they, and the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were God's Legal Covenant People; and ſo the Type of the whole Spiritual <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who ſhould be waſhed in the Blood of Chriſt, or Blood of the New Covenant, and ſanctified by his Spirit, as is ſaid before.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:65865:109"/>
2. Moreover evident it is, that tho the Covenant of Grace, in the Diſpenſation of it under the Goſpel, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and the Spiritual Privileges more extenſive than were the Privileges of the Legal Covenant and Legal Church; yet the external Privileges are leſs and not ſo extenſive now as was theirs: How many outward and earthly Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges had the Jews and Miniſters of God under the Law more than the Saints and Miniſters of Chriſt have now? Many of which I have reckoned up in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Treatiſe. Thus I cloſe with your Eighth Argument.</p>

            <p>MR. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith, <q>If <hi>John</hi> baptized Infants, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm doth always belong unto them; for the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> and the Baptiſm of the Apoſtles were the ſame in the Subſtance of it: He baptized in the Name of Chriſt to come, and they baptized in the Name of Chriſt that was come.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you can prove <hi>John</hi> baptized Infants, you do your Buſineſs indifferent well.</p>
            <p>Now ſay you, </p>
            <q>
               <p>What we are to prove in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is, that <hi>John</hi> baptized Infants; to manifeſt this, let it be conſidered,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt came not to nullify the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but rather to fulfil it; and the Covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi> was, that God would be a God to his People, and to their Seed; all the Viſible Church of the Jews were in this Covenant: <hi>John</hi> warneth them that they truſted not in the Privileges of this Covenant, by living ungodly Lives; he doth not in any Place make void this Covenant, but rather confirms it, ſaying, God will raiſe other Children to <hi>Abraham,</hi> if the Jews brought not forth Fruit meet for Repentance; he came to baptize the Seed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:65865:110"/>
which were all of them in the Covenant of God, not only the Parents but the Children alſo: Therefore their Children had the ſame right to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm as their Parents had.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I deny not but the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in Covenant with God, both Parents and Children, and ſo abode till the old Covenant and old Covenant-Seed were caſt out; but <hi>What ſaith the Scripture? Caſt out the Bond-woman and her Son,</hi> Gal. 4. 30. Now the Apoſtle tells you, by the Bond-woman is meant the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, and by her Son the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> as ſuch, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 22, 23, 24, 25.</p>
            <p>2. This Grant of yours proves that the Jewiſh Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which took in all the People both Parents and Children, was not the Covenant of Grace; becauſe but a finall number of the Jews were in God's Election, and ſo in the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>See Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> on the <hi>Hebrews, 3d Vol. Pag.</hi> 256. <q>The Covenant of Grace in Chriſt is made only with the <hi>Israel</hi> of God, the Church of the Elect.</q>  
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 291. <q>The new Covenant is made with all, who effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively and eventually are made Partakers of it; and if they are not ſo with whom the New Covenant is made, it comes ſhort of the Old in Efficacy, who were actual Partakers of the benefit of that, that is, of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Benefits.</q>
            </p>
            <p>3. Nor doth that which you mention help you, <hi>viz.</hi> that in that Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 'tis ſaid <hi>God would be their God,</hi> or a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his Seed in their Generations. For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, God may be ſaid to be the God of a People divers manner of ways, as Dr. <hi>Bates</hi> obſerves.</p>
            <q>
               <p n="1">1. Upon the account of Creation, thus he is our God and Father; <hi>O Lord thou art our Father, we are the Clay, and thou art our Potter, and we are all the works of thy Hands,</hi> Iſa. 64. 8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Saith he, By external Calling and Profeſſion, there is an intercurrent Relation of the Father and Son between God and his People: Thus the Poſterity of <hi>Seth</hi> are called the Sons of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. and the entire Nation of the Jews are ſo called; <hi>When</hi> Iſrael <hi>was
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65865:110"/>
young, I called my Son from</hi> Egypt, Hoſ. 11.</p>
            </q>
            <p n="2">  Dr. <hi>Bates</hi>in his Sermon on Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Funeral.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God may be ſaid to be the God of a People by way of ſpecial Intereſt, by Election, Regeneration and Adoption; thus he was not a God to the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> both to Parents and Children without exception: Yet we grant God was their God by entring into a viſible and external Covenant with them; and as ſo conſidered he was ſaid to be their God, and an Husband to them. Jer. 31. 32. <hi>Which Covenant they broke, altho I was an Husband to them, ſaith the Lord.</hi> But pray obſerve, the New Covenant is ſaid not <hi>to be according to that Covenant which God made with this People, when he took them by the Hand and brought them out of the Land of</hi> Egypt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Now if that Covenant, in which God is ſaid to be their God, was the Old Covenant, or the Legal Covenant which God hath took away, to eſtabliſh the <hi>Second,</hi> What doth that ſignify which you affirm here?</p>
            <p>Certainly, <hi>John</hi> would not go about to eſtabliſh that Covenant which he knew his Maſter was ready to take away, <hi>viz.</hi> the Covenant of Peculiarity God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Natural Seed, as ſuch.</p>
            <p>We deny not, but the free Promiſe that God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> is the Covenant of Grace; but that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to Believers Seed, as ſuch: For ſome of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers Seed may be in the Covenant of Grace, and ſome of Believers Seed may not, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Children of the Promiſe, or Covenant of Grace, or the Elect of God may lie amongſt the Unbelievers Children, as well as amongſt Believers Children: Tho I doubt not but more of Believers Seed are called than of others, and have greater Privileges, <hi>i. e.</hi> by the Inſtruction, Prayers, and good Example of their Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Tho <hi>John</hi> did not nullify the external Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, yet he, being to prepare Chriſt's way, gave the Jews a clear Intimation of the repealing of it, or the period thereof, and that <hi>now</hi> it would ſtand them in no
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:65865:111"/>
ſtead; they indeed made this which you ſay an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come to his Baptiſm, namely becauſe of that Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> or their being his Children: But what did <hi>John</hi> ſay? <hi>Think not to ſay within your ſelves, we have</hi>

                  </gap> Father.</hi> As much as if he ſhould ſay, your being the Seed of believing <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the Fleſh, will give you no Right to Goſpel-Baptiſm nor other Goſpel Ordinances and Privileges, tho it gave you right to Circumciſion and Legal Privileges.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ſay, He doth not make void the Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> but rather confirms it; ſaying, God could raiſe other Children to <hi>Abraham,</hi> if the Jews brought not forth Fruit meet for Repentance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Tho he did not make void that Legal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, yet he explained the nature thereof to the Jews, and ſhewed them their great Error and Miſtake about it, clearly intimating that the Covenant of Grace God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and with his Spiritual Seed did differ, and was of another Nature with that Covenant which God made with him and his Natural Seed, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h; (for ſaith he, <hi>God is able to raiſe up of theſe Stones C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> to</hi> Abraham, meaning the Gentiles, as Expositors give it) If the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham</hi> ran only to his Fleſhly Seed, as such, Why did <hi>John</hi> ſay God could raiſe up others to be his Children? even ſuch that were not of his Natural Seed. And alſo, Why did he refuſe them, who were his Natural Seed, <hi>That did not bring forth Fruit meet for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, From hence therefore it follows, in oppoſition to what you ſay, That Goſpel-Baptiſm is not of the ſame extent with Circumcision.</p>
            <p>
               <q>As the whole Countrey, ſay you, were under Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, ſo doth <hi>John</hi> receive them to his Baptiſm, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused none that came to his Baptiſm, but received <hi>Publicans, Sadduces, Phariſees,</hi> viz. <hi>the Generations of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ipers,</hi> Matth. 3. 7, 8. And can it be thought he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused little Children?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:65865:111"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I wonder you ſhould affirm that <hi>John</hi> received all the Countrey to his Baptiſm, and refuſed none, no not the Generation of Vipers: This I deny, and you have no ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Reaſon to aſſert it, ſince he rebuked them when he ſaw them coming to his Baptiſm, and bid them bring forth Fruit meet for Repentance. Prove, if you can, that he baptized one Soul but ſuch only that were penitent, and demonſtrated the truth of their Repentance by bringing forth of the Fruits thereof.</p>
            <p>'Tis very ſtrange to me that any Man ſhould aſſert that <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt (whoſe Doctrine and Miniſtry by all Divines is look'd upon to be very <hi>ſevere</hi> and <hi>ſharp)</hi> ſhould baptize all, even the worſt of Men, yea ſuch whom he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Viprous Generation. But what is the purport of this Argument of yours for Infant-Baptiſm? Certainly all may eaſily ſee it: Doth it not tend to prove that all ungodly and unbelieving Men and Women are to be baptized as well as Infants?</p>
            <p>Let me but juſtly infer upon you, and from what you ſay here, after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt baptized all that came to him, even all the ungodly Jews, as <hi>Publicans, Sadduces, Phariſees,</hi> yea thoſe <hi>Generations of Vipers;</hi> then Unbelievers, yea the worſt and vileſt of Men, are as true Subjects of Baptiſm as Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. 'Tis no matter whether they believe or not, repent or not, or at preſent bring forth Fruit meet for Repentance or not; <hi>John</hi> took their Word, their Promiſe that they would do thoſe things afterwards.</p>
            <p>What Notions do you impoſe upon your unwary Readers? I thought all Adult Perſons (according to the avowed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the <hi>Pedo-baptiſts,</hi> as well as <hi>Anti-pedobaptiſts)</hi> muſt believe, and manifeſt true Repentance before they ought to be baptized. Reader, ſee Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Book, <hi>Confirmation and Reſtoration,</hi> printed 1658. He affirms, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That a perſonal believing is the Condition of the Title of them at Age, is far paſt doubt.</q> 
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Saith he, <q>The Promiſe it ſelf doth expreſly require Faith of our own, of all the Adult. <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mark 16. 16. <hi>What doth hinder me to be baptized? And</hi> Philip <hi>ſaid, if thou believeſt with all thine Heart, thou mayſt.</hi>
               </q> Theſe two Scriptures and many more Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> quotes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:65865:112"/>
His 2d Argument is this, <q>If a Profeſſion of Faith were not neceſſary, <hi>coram Eccleſia,</hi> to Mens Church-Memberſhip and Privileges, then Infidels and Heathens would have Right.</q>
            </p>
            <p>His 3d Argument runs thus, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>It is a granted Caſe among all Chriſtians, that a Profeſſion is thus neceſſary; the Apoſtles and Antient Church admitted none without it.</q> 
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 17, 21.</p>
            <p>Again he ſays, <hi>Pag.</hi> 24. </p>
            <q>
               <p>We find when <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt ſet up his Miniſtry, he cauſed the People to confeſs their Sins:—And whereas ſome ſay that <hi>John</hi> baptized them that he calleth a Generation of Vipers; I anſwer, ſaith he, we will believe that when they prove it: It ſeems rather that he put them back, as to thoſe <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. Saith he, It is plain that they made an open Profeſſion, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they were openly told the Doctrine which they muſt be baptized into, if they did conſent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is ſaid they that received the Word were baptized.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is as certain therefore, that they firſt teſtified their glad reception of the Word.</p>
               <p n="4">4. VVe may not imagine that <hi>Peter</hi> was God, or knew the Hearts of thoſe thouſands, and therefore he muſt know it by their Profeſſion, that they gladly received the VVord.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Their own Mouths cry out for advice in order to their Salvation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It had been abſurd for the Apoſtles to attempt to baptize Men that had not firſt profeſſed their Conſent.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Scripture (ſaith he) gives us not the full Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Narration of all that was ſaid in ſuch Caſes, but of ſo much as was neceſſary.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Inſtitution and Nature of the Ordinance tells us, that Baptiſm could not be adminiſired, without a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to the Adult; for they were to be baptized into the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt: Therefore were to profeſs that they believed in the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, <hi>&amp;c. Pag.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The conſtant practice of the univerſal Church, hath given us by infallible Tradition, as full aſſurance of the order of Baptiſm, and in particular of an expreſs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Covenant then made, as of any Point that by the Hand of the Church can be received. <hi>Pag.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:65865:112"/>
10. And it was in thoſe days a more notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Profeſſion to be ſo Baptized, and to joyn in the Holy Aſſemblies then now it is, when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity did hazard Mens Liberties, Eſtates and Lives, to be openly then Baptized, upon covenanting with God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Moreover ſaith he, it is ſaid of all that were Baptized, (being then at Age) that they firſt believed, and how could the Baptizers know that they believed, but by their Profeſſion, <hi>pag.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>Yea, 'tis ſaid of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> that he believed, and was baptized, which though he might really have ſome hiſtorical Faith; yet implyeth, that he openly profeſſed more then he indeed had, or elſe he had ſcarce been baptized, which hath cauſed Interpreters to judge, that by Faith, is meant a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith. And if ſo, then ſure a profeſſion of Faith is ſtill neceſſary. <hi>p.</hi> 27.</p>
               <p>Yea (ſaith he) Chriſt in his Commiſſion, directeth his Apoſtles to make Diſciples, and then baptize them; promiſing, that he that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved. And who can tell whether a Man be a Diſciple, a Believer, or an Infidel, but by his Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>How was it known but by their Profeſſion, that the <hi>Samaritans</hi> believed <hi>Phillip,</hi> preaching the things concerning the Kingdom of God and the name of Jeſus Chriſt, before they were baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 8, 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phillip</hi> cauſed the <hi>Eunuch</hi> to profeſs, before he would baptize him, that he believed that Jeſus Chriſt was the Son of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saul</hi> had more then a bare Profeſſion before bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 15, 17.</p>
               <p>Alſo <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Company had more then a Profeſſion, for they had the Holy Ghoſt poured on them, ſpeaking with Tongues. And it was ſuch a Gift of the Spirit, that cauſed the Apoſtle to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that God had granted the Gentiles Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto Life, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 8.</p>
               <p>The Converted Gentiles, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 48. ſhewed their belief and gladneſs. <hi>p.</hi> 27.</p>
               <p>Gods Order is (to the Adult ſaith he,) firſt to ſend Preachers to proclaim the Goſpel, and when by that
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:65865:113"/>
Men are brought ſo far as to profeſs or manifeſt their Eyes are opened, and that they are turned from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, then they muſt be baptized for the remiſſion of Sins.</p>
               <p>As their Sins are not forgiven them till they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 12. ſo they muſt not be baptized till they profeſs themſelves converted, ſeeing to the Church, <hi>none eſſe,</hi> and <hi>none apparere,</hi> is all one; Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is the ſumm of that preaching that makes Diſciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 21. and therefore both theſe muſt by profeſſion ſeem to be received before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at Age are baptized, <hi>p.</hi> 30. 31.</p>
               <p>If as many as are baptized, are baptized into his death, and are buried with him by baptiſm into his Death; that like as Chriſt was raiſed from the Dead, then we ſhould walk in newneſs of Life.</p>
               <p>Then no doubt, but ſuch as were baptized did firſt profeſs this Mortification, and conſent to be buried, and revived with Chriſt, and to live to him in newneſs of Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Paul</hi> was never ſo much for <hi>Opus Operatum</hi> above the Papiſts, as to think that the baptizing of an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del might effect theſe high and excellent things, and he that profeſſeth not Faith, nor never did, is to the Church an Infidel.</p>
               <p>In our baptiſm, we put off the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh, by the Circumciſion of Chriſt, being buried with him, and riſing with him through Faith, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him, and having all our Treſpaſſes forgiven, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 11, 12, 13. And will any Man, (ſaith he,) yea will <hi>Paul,</hi> aſcribe all this to thoſe that did not profeſs the things ſignified, or the neceſſary Condition? Will baptiſm in the Judgment of a wiſe Man, do all this for an Infidel, (let me add, or to an Infant) or one (ſaith he,) that profeſſeth not to be a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Baptiſm is ſaid to ſave us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3, 21. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that will be baptized, muſt profeſs the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications neceſſary to the ſaved, <hi>p.</hi> 32.</p>
               <p>The Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven are put into the Churches Hands, and they that are looſed on Earth, are looſed in Heaven; (if the Keys do not err); and therefore paſtors of the Church muſt abſolve none
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65865:113"/>
by Baptiſm, that do not by profeſſion ſeem abſolva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Heaven, they muſt profeſs to have the old Man Crucified with Chriſt, that the Bodie of Sin be deſtroyed, that henceforth they might not ſerve Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>As many as have been baptized into Chriſt, (ſaith he,) have put on Chriſt Jeſus, and are <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed and Heirs according to the Promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27, 28. This ſpeaks the Apoſtle of the probability grounded on a credible Profeſſion, and therefore it is clear, that the profeſſion was preſuppoſed that might ſupport this charitable Judgment.</p>
               <p>Our baptiſm is the ſolemnizing of our Marriage with Chriſt. And its a new and ſtrang kind of Marriage, where there is no profeſſion of Conſent. <note n="†" place="margin">Worthy <hi>Britains,</hi> ſee how Mr. <hi>Richard Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> hath out down In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptiſm with his own Sword; can In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants ſhew their conſent to be married to Chriſt, or profeſs Faith in him.</note> The baptized are in Scripture, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Men waſhed, Sanctifyed, Juſtifyed.

            <p> Thus far Mr. <hi>Richard Baxter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, I thought fit to confute you in your bold Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt baptized all that came to him, even thoſe Phariſees, that he called a Generation of Vipers, by making uſe of the Sword of <hi>Goliah; Reader,</hi> how this Pedo-Baptiſts, Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> hath not only overthrown Mr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s argument here for Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, but utterly hath overthrown Infant Baptiſm it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For (he ſaith) the Commiſſion directeth Chriſt's Apoſtles to make Diſciples, and then baptize them, <hi>p.</hi> 27.</p>
            <p n="2">2. (He ſaith,) the ſumm of that preaching that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Diſciples, is repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>p.</hi> 30, 31.</p>
            <p>Where then is the Commiſſion to baptize Infants, Baptiſm can't make them Diſciples, nor their Parents Faith neither; no, 'tis the preaching of the word, he
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65865:114"/>
that has not Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Chriſts.</p>
            <p>You muſt have a new Commiſſion to baptize unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers or Infants either, before ye ought to do it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <q>You ſay <hi>John</hi> came to prepare the way of the Lord, the end of his baptiſm was to bind all the People to believe in the Lord Jeſus, which was to come. Faith was not the condition of <hi>John</hi>'s Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, but the end thereof; his Baptiſm laid a particular obligation on all the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> to receive Chriſt, Childred as well as others, were bound to receive him when they came to Age, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Baptiſm was a ſign of that obligation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Alſo then it muſt follow, that the baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> and that baptiſm adminiſtred by the Apoſtles, differed in an eſſential part, which you your ſelf but a little before, do utterly deny, and affirm that they were both eſſentially, one and the ſame baptiſm, only one unto him that was to come, and the other into him that was come, Dead, and Riſen again: Now, was not Faith and Repentance the condition of that Baptiſm admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by the Apoſtles; did not they require Faith, and a profeſſion of Faith of all they admitted to Baptiſm; the Scriptures, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> cites in the aforementioned Book of his, fully proves they did, and that thoſe things were prerequiſites of it, therefore Baptiſm as adminiſtred by <hi>John,</hi> and by the Diſciples of Chriſt, was not only to the end, they ſhould be obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and repent, but Faith and Repentance was the condition or qualification of all they baptized. For <hi>John</hi> (nor the Apoſtles neither) would take a bare ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal profeſſion of Repentance of thoſe that came to Baptiſm; <hi>John</hi> commanded them to produce the Fruits of Repentance, <hi>or to bring forth Fruit meet for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> and this was his way to prepare the way of the Lord, or to prepare a People for the Lord's Spiritual Building; he preached, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is at hand.</hi> That Vow or Promiſe in Baptiſm that you dream of, prepares no Man for Chriſt, nor fits
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65865:114"/>
any for his Church; no. no, it muſt be Converſion, Faith, and Regeneration it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <q>You ſay little Children were Members of the Church of God in the time of <hi>John,</hi> none can deny that, becauſe Circumſion, the Seal of the Covenant, was upon them, all the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> were at that time God's viſible Church, and they were his only Church upon Earth; they were not out of the Church before they were baptized, neither were they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the Church of God through Baptiſm, as thoſe that were out of it before, but the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were baptized, becauſe they were Members of God's viſible Church; and becauſe little Children were Members of the viſible Church, the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> appertained unto them.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> I anſwer, we deny not but the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Infants were Members of God's legal Church; but I ask you whether <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm was a legal Ordinance, or a pure Goſpel Ordinance, as Circumciſion was, prove it; we deny it, and ſay it was Evangelical, and did not appertain to the <hi>Jews,</hi> or the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the Fleſh as ſuch.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If you ſhould prove it was a legal Ordinance, yet it doth not follow, Infants of the <hi>Jews</hi> ought to be baptized as their Males were to be Circumciſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was a clear politive command to circumciſe them, but none to baptize them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If you argue from the right of Circumciſion, then it follows, that none but their male Infants ought to be baptized. What authority had <hi>John</hi> to baptize fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, whether the adult or Infants, as I ſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I am troubled to ſee how you confound your Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples underſtanding, was the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church or the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church of God under the Law, and the viſible Goſpel Church, formally and materially one and the ſame.</p>
            <p>Had the <hi>Jews</hi> a right to all Goſpel Ordinances and Privileges, becauſe they abode his legal viſible Church till the Death of Chriſt; we grant the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church of God under Law and Goſpel, is but one and the ſame; but doth not the Goſpel Church in its Ordinances, Adminiſtrations, Rights and Piviledges,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65865:115"/>
vaſtly differ from the legal, was not the viſible Church of God under the Law, a National Church made up of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> People only, and is the Goſpel Church not congregational, conſiſting of both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> that believe, or are born of the Spirit.</p>
            <p n="5">5. What, though <hi>John</hi> did not make void the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of peculiarity God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet he laid the <hi>Ax</hi> at the Root; and being to prepare matter for a new Church State, and his Miniſtry being Goſpel, and the Ordinance he adminiſtred a Goſpel Inſtitution, he told the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that their being <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Seed, or having <hi>Abraham</hi> to their Father now, was no good <hi>Plea</hi> or Argument for them to plead, as a right to this new Adminiſtration. <hi>John</hi>'s Doctrine did in part, finiſh the Law and the Prophets, or old covenant Diſpenſation, though the full period of it was not come till the death of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Hence our Saviour ſaith, <hi>the Law and the Prophets were untill</hi> John, <hi>and from that time, the Kingdom of Heaven began to ſuffer Violence, and Men ſtrove to preſs into it,</hi> though its full and perfect beginning was not till our Lord had broken down the middle wall of Partition, and nail'd the legal Rites and carnal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances to his Croſs, and removed that enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> making both one new Man, and ſo a new Goſpel Church; pray take what one of your own Brethren, a Pedo-Baptiſt ſaith, of <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtration, it is <hi>Reverend Cotton</hi> of <hi>New-England.</hi>

               <q>The firſt (ſaith he) is the Root of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant, which theſe People truſted upon, and of that it is which <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt ſpeaketh, now is the Ax laid to the Root of the Trees; think not to ſay within your Selves, we have <hi>Abraham</hi> to our Father, ſo that all their Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that they had in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant, Temple and Tabernacle and ſuch things, are burnt up, and ſo they have no Root left them to ſtand upon, and this is one thing intended by the Root. Again he ſaith, the Lord hath cut us off from hope, in the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Parents, and from boaſting of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; again ſaith he, this we read of, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 1. it is ſpoken of the miniſtry of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, which
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:65865:115"/>
did burn as an <hi>Oven</hi> againſt all the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and left them neither the Root of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, nor the branch of their own good Works, he cutteth them off from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by cutting them off from the Root, he leaveth them no Ground to truſt on, <hi>Cotton</hi> on the Covenant, <hi>pag.</hi> 177, and <hi>p.</hi> 21, 22.</q>
            </p>
            <p>How direct is this to the purpoſe, and it as fully o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth all that you ſpeak in this Argument; this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Author</hi> Concludes, that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant made with his natural Seed as ſuch, was cut down by <hi>John,</hi> though the Tree was not yet removed, nor the Chaff blown or fanned away; but you would make the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple believe, <hi>John</hi> confirmed that old Covenant right, and baptized all the <hi>Jews</hi> upon the Authority of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Covenant; as if inſtead of cutting the Tree down at the Root, he was about to plant it afreſh, or uphold its ſtanding, which had it been ſo, he would have rather ſaid, <hi>think to ſay within your ſelves, we have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father, for upon that foot of Account, I am to baptize you all, you being all in God's Covenant, though you be a Generation of Vipers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how directly contrary to this Doctrine of yours did <hi>John</hi> preach to them', and clearly took them off of any ſuch a pretended right to Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they were in Covenant with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſay <hi>John</hi> did not cut down one Branch of that Covenant. Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> ſays, he cut down the Tree at the Root; you ſay, he baptized Infants upon that foot of account, but ſince, God's Word ſpeaks not one word of any ſuch thing, 'Tis plain, you aſſert your own Fancies, or groundleſs ſuppoſitions.</p>
            <q>
               <p>There is no doubt, ſay you, but that Parents brought their Children with them to the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> for God commanded them to bring their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with them into the Congregation, <hi>Deut. 29. 10, 11, 12, &amp;c.</hi> their Zeal was great for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 12. and 21. 20. therefore ſay you, if <hi>John</hi> refuſed their Children, they would not ſo willingly have come to his Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>They brought their Children to Chriſt; therefore they brought their Children to the Baptiſm of</p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, you ſay no doubt but they brought their Chldren to <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm, but without doubt they did not, ſay I; becauſe if they had, it would without doubt have been written, but ſince it is no where writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that they did do it; nor of <hi>John</hi>'s baptizing one Infant, there is no doubt but we are in the right, <hi>viz. John</hi> baptized no Infants, nor any but penitent Perſons, becauſe he required Repentance, and the Fruits of it in all that came to his Baptiſm. Moreover,</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p>Baptiſm, I tell you again, being of meer poſitive Right, you can draw no ſuch Concluſions for what you plead for, 'tis only their Duty to be baptized, that Chriſt commanded to be baptized, and that is thoſe that are made Diſciples by the word preached, or thoſe that believe in Chriſt, or that profeſs Faith in him; and 'tis the New Teſtament only, muſt inform us who are the ſubjects of Goſpel Ordinances that depend on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon Laws meerly poſitive, according to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Pleaſure of the inſtitutor of them, or holy Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ſay they brought their Children to Chriſt, therefore they brought them to <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> If <hi>John</hi> had wrought Miracles and healed the Sick, I doubt not, but they would have brought their Children to him to have them healed, as well as they brought them to Chriſt, but <hi>John</hi> wrought no Miracles; alſo our Saviour was a healing the Sick when they brought Children to him; and it may fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be inferred, they brought little Children that were diſtemper'd to him, to have him lay his Hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, which was his way in healing the Sick, as I have ſaid before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:65865:116"/>
               <q>You ſay Infant Baptiſm was an uſual thing in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, ſeveral hundred years before the time of <hi>John,</hi> and tell us a ſtory of <hi>Moſes Ben Maimon,</hi> who colected the Rites of the ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> I have anſwered that already, you having urged that argument before.</p>
            <p>'Tis evident it was no other but a <hi>Jewiſh hamane</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, if it be as you ſay; for God never commanded the <hi>Jews</hi> to baptize Infants, though you before would make your unwary Reader think that <hi>Jacob</hi> invented it. I am ſorry to ſee ſuch ſtuff from a Man of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>What credit is to be given to the <hi>Jewiſh Talmud,</hi> what one <hi>Jewiſh Rabbi</hi> affirms, concerning this matter, I have ſhewed, another ſeems to deny, <hi>Rabbi Joſhua</hi> confeſſeth that the <hi>Jews</hi> baptized Infants, <hi>after the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Counſel,</hi> not by any Authority from God by <hi>Moſes,</hi> or any of his Holy Prophets, but ſhall we think <hi>John</hi> Baptized Infants by vertue of any human Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that was among the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, a popiſh Tradition is of as good authority, as a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> one; you may affirm, the Papiſts for many hundred years baptized Infants, but where is it written in God's Word, that God commanded the <hi>Jews</hi> to baptize their Proſelites, or that Chriſtians ought to baptize their Infants: <hi>to the Law and Teſtament,</hi> the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture is a perfect Rule.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ſay <hi>John</hi> baptized little Children, for he bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized the whole Nation in general, whereof Children were a great part; he refuſed none that came, or were brought to him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 5, 6. then went out to him <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and all <hi>Judea,</hi> and all the Regions round about <hi>Jordan,</hi> and were baptized of him in <hi>Jordan.</hi> Now ſay you, if <hi>John</hi> baptized all <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and all <hi>Judea,</hi> and all the Regions round about <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> and all the People; it is certain he baptized Infants, unleſs we think there were no Children in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> I anſwer, now you think you have done your Buſineſs; but Sir, doth not this Argument of yours as ſtrongly prove, that all wicked and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people may be baptized alſo, ye <hi>Swearers, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, Murderers,</hi> yea the worſt of Men, for can we
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:65865:117"/>
think there were none ſuch in <hi>Jeruſalem, Iudah,</hi> nor in all the Regions round about, yea that we may baptize <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> for no doubt, but there were ſome of all Nations at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. You affirm that <hi>John</hi> baptized the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> even every Man, Woman and Child, or elſe I miſtake you; now if this were ſo, how it is ſaid, <hi>that Chriſt made and baptized more Diſciples then</hi> John, <hi>John 4. 1. John 3. 26. 'tis ſaid that Jeſus bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and all Men came to him.</hi> How did <hi>John</hi> baptize all, and Chriſt baptize more of the People then <hi>John;</hi> what think you, were they rebaptized; certainly, you will make them all proper Anabaptiſts; beſides, if <hi>John</hi> baptized all the <hi>Jews,</hi> where were thoſe three thouſand that St. <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Diſciples bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 40, 41, 42. were they not dwellers at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and notwithſtanding Chriſt baptized more Diſciples then <hi>John;</hi> yet 'tis ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 13. that the number of the Diſciples that were at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were but about one Hundred and Twenty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I have ſhewed, that according to <hi>Scripture Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> frequently by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> a part is put for the whole, and ſometimes the far leſſer part alſo. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>All the Cattel in Egypt died, Exod.</hi> 9. 6. that is, all that were in the Field: Alſo Chriſt ſaith, <hi>When he was lifted up he would draw all men unto him,</hi> Joh. 12. 32. Doth that intend all univerſally? So <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>All ſeek their own:</hi> And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Ye ſhall be hated of all men for my name ſake.</hi> See theſe Scriptures, <hi>Exod. 32. 3, 26. Jer. 6. 3. 1 Cor. 10. 7. Iſa. 2. 2, 3. Acts</hi> 2. 5. See <hi>Glaſſius Illiricus,</hi> and other Tropical Writers: Alſo read <hi>Philologiae Sacra,</hi> and our laſt Annotators on the Holy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, called <hi>Pool's Annotations,</hi> on this Text. <q>The Term <hi>All,</hi> ſay they, here twice repeated, is enough to let us know, that 'tis often in Scripture ſignificative no farther than <hi>Many</hi>—For it cannot be imagined, that every individual Perſon in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Regions round about <hi>Jordan,</hi> went to hear <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> but a great many.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From hence it appears, That it is no ground for Mr. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen</hi> to affirm, that by all <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and all <hi>Judea,</hi> &amp;c. muſt be intended every individual Perſon, both Men, Women, and Children; but rather, ſome of all Sorts,

Degrees, Sexes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It ſhews, that Multitudes went to hear him, and many were baptized by him in <hi>Jordan,</hi> confeſſing their Sins with unfeigned Repentance.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But (you ſay) the Text doth not tell us what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Confeſſion this was, whether in Words or Works: Their submiſſion to Baptiſm, was an actual Confeſſion of their Uncleanneſs, and that they ſtood in need of Waſhing, it cannot be thought that it was a Confeſſion in Words; becauſe one Man could not receive a particular Confeſſion from the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try if they made a Confeſſion in Words: It is like one made it in the Names of others, even as the Prieſts did in the Names of all the People, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 21. Thus the Parents might confeſs their Sins for themſelves and their Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Ans.</hi> Let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Arguments ſerve to confute you here; he tells you, That from Scripture and the univerſal Practice of the ancient Church, That Faith, and a Confeſſion of Faith, yea a verbal Confeſſion, was requirad oi all that were baptized; <hi>With the heart man believeth, and with the mouth confeſſion is made to ſalvation,</hi> Rom. 10. 10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Certainly you are ſtrangely left to blindneſs of Mind about this Matter: Did ever any Man, except your ſelf, and one Mr. <hi>Excel,</hi> whom I anſwered lately, affirm, That all ungodly and unbelieving Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that were willing to be baptized, were proper and fit Subjects of Sacred Baptiſm? For all Men may ſee, that this Argument of yours is for their Baptiſm, and as forcible to prove they ought to be baptized, as 'tis to prove the Baptiſm of Infants: For, if <hi>John</hi> baptized all the whole Country, even every individual Perſon, then Miniſters now may baptiſe all in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, even all the World, let them be what they will, <hi>Turks, Pagans, Infidels, Swearers, Drunkards,</hi> and <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Thieves, Murtherers,</hi> if they will but promiſe to turn from their Sins and repent, whether they do it or no, yet, if your Argument be good, they ought to be baptized: But how contrary to this is that which all your Brethren generally aſſert? <hi>viz.</hi> That in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times, when the Goſpel was firſt preached and? Churches planted, all that were firſt baptized were Believers, Saints, and godly Perſons, and upon their Faith their Children were (as they ſay) bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:65865:118"/>
alſo, which is that we deny; tho' they are right as to what theyſpeak in reſpect of Believers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but, ſiuce we have ſo fully refuted what you ſay of Baptizing adult Perſons that are Unbelievers, I will ſay no more of that in this place.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis evident what you affirm is falſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>John</hi> baptized the whole Country, even every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Person, and that by a plain Inſtance: Is it not ſaid, That <hi>the Phariſees and Lawyers rejected the counſel of God againſt themſelves, being not baptized of him,</hi> Luke 7. 30. <q>That is, faith our Annotators, not receiving <hi>John</hi>'s Doctrine of Repentance, for the remiſſion of Sins and bringing forth Fruits worthy of amendment of Life, not ſubmitting to Baptiſm, as a Teſtimony of ſuch a Repentance. For <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm ſignifieth his whole Adminiſtration.</q> See <hi>Pool</hi>'s <hi>Annotations</hi> on that Place. All may ſee what a kind of Confeſſion it was, <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm required; it was more than a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal Confeſſion of Sin, even the Fruits of a changed Heart, and a new Life: And where this Doctrine of his was not received, and theſe Fruits appeared not, <hi>John</hi> would not baptize them.</p>
            <p>And now to conclude with this <hi>Chapter,</hi> in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith, from the whole it clearly doth follow, That <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> did not baptize the whole Country, nor any one Infant, no not any one Perſon, but ſuch who believed and ſeemed at the leaſt to bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance: And, as he ſays, <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm was the beginning of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, it followeth, that no Infant ought to be baptized, and that the external Privileges of the Goſpel are reſtrained and not ſo large as were the outward Rites and Privileges of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, tho' the Spiritual Privileges of the Goſpel are larger and more extenſive than thoſe of the Law were.</p>

Heb. 11. 7. 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 20, 21. Not himſelf and his Seed, but his Men-Servants and Maid-Servants, and of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that were willing to receive the true Religion, and their Seed, <hi>Gen. 17. 23. Exod.</hi> 12. 40. And ſo God's Covenant continued in the Families of the Faithful, until the coming of Chriſt, for near four thouſand Years. If any ſay, that the Diſpenſation is altered, and the Members rent from the Head of Families, let them ſhew a plain Scripture for it.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer; As touching that Covenant God made with <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family, it was not only made with him and his Family, but with all the World, for they were the Repreſentatives of all that ſhould live on the Earth; nay, and not only Mankind, but with Fowls of the Air and Beaſts of the Field. See <hi>Gen. 9. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. And God ſpake unto Noah, and to his ſons,</hi> Verſe 8. <hi>And I, behold I will eſtabliſh my covenant with you, and your Seed after you,</hi> Verſe 9. <hi>And with
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:65865:119"/>
every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattel, and of every beaſt of the earth with you, from all that go out of the ark, to every beaſt of the earth,</hi> Ver. 10. <hi>And I will eſtabliſh my covenant with you, neither ſhall all fleſh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall there any more be a flood to deſtroy the earth,</hi> Verſe 11.</p>
            <p>Now to what purpoſe do you mention this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or the temporal Salvation of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Family in the Ark? May be <hi>Noah</hi>'s Family, or ſome of them, were ſaved with that external Salvation for his ſake; yet this proves not that his Faith extended to the Spiritual Salvation of the Souls of his Children, for he had a curſed <hi>Cham</hi> to one of his Sons, his Faith could not ſave him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the Ark being a Type of Baptiſm, or that his Family were baptized in the Ark, this, as I have once before told you, doth as much tend to prove that all the World may be baptized, even the good, and bad, and Cattle alſo, as any in particular; for all, in the Ark, were as truly baptized, as any that were in it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Had you ſaid <hi>Noah</hi>'s Family was a Type of the Goſpel-Church, you had ſpoken ſomething to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for ſo Expoſitors intimate, and not without good Reaſon. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. As all his Familily were received into the Ark, ſo all the Members of the Goſpel-Church were by Faith to be received into Chriſt, the Anti-Type of the Ark.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As <hi>Noah</hi> built the Ark according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God, ſo Chriſt built his Church, and did every thing according to the Commandment of his Father.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Noah</hi> took many Trees well hewen and fitted to build the Ark; ſo Chriſt takes many Believers, who are Spiritually well hewed and fitted by the Word and Spirit, to build his Church, who are called <hi>trees of righteouſneſs,</hi> choſen People, as <hi>Noah</hi> built the Ark of ſuch Trees or Wood, God himſelf choſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As ſome clean and unclean Beaſts were received into the Ark, yea and a <hi>Cham</hi> who was an ungodly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo this might figure forth, that ſome unſanctified
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:65865:119"/>
Perſons (tho' not by God's appointment) would get into, or be received into the Goſpel-Church. And,</p>
            <p n="5">5. As all that were not received into the Ark pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, ſo all who get not Spiritually into Chriſt by Faith, or are not Members of the viſible or inviſible Church, ſhall be damned and periſh eternally.</p>
            <p n="6">6. As <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark was ſometimes, (no doubt,) over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed or covered with Waves, and thoſe that were in it; ſo all true Believers, that are Members of the true Goſpel-Church, ought to be dipped, baptized, or overwhelmed in Water. And, as Sir <hi>Norton Knatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> obſerves, <q>The Ark was a Figure of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. (Speaking of that Text) Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> cites 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 20. (ſaith he,) Baptiſm which now ſaves us by Water, that is, by the aſſiſtance of Water, is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical of the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> and it doth not ſignifie the laying down of the filth of the Fleſh, but the Covenant of a good Conſcience towards God, while we are plunged in the Water, which is to teſtifie our belief of the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that there is a manifeſt <hi>Antitheſis</hi> between theſe words by Water, and by the Reſurrection: Nor is the Elegancy of it diſpleaſing. The Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> not the Flood, was a Type of Baptiſm; and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was the Anti-type of the Ark, not as if Baptiſm is a waſhing away of the Filth of the Fleſh by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein it anſwers not all to the Ark; but, as it is the Covenant of a good Conſcience towards God by the Reſurrection of Chriſt, in the belief of which Reſurrection we are ſaved, as they were ſaved by the Ark of <hi>Noah;</hi> for the Ark and Baptiſm were both a Type and Figure of the Reſurrection, ſo that the proper End of Baptiſm ought not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as if it were a Sign of the waſhing away of Sin, altho' it be thus oftentimes taken <hi>Metonymically</hi> in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and by the Fathers, but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Signal of the Reſurrection by Faith in the Reſurrection of Chriſt; of which Baptiſm is a lively and emphatical Figure; as alſo was the Ark out of which <hi>Noah</hi> returned as from the Sepulchre to a new Life. </q> Thus far Sir <hi>Norton Knatchbal</hi> in his Notes printed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> 1677, who though a great Pedo-Baptiſts, yet denyed ſprinkling or pouring to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:65865:120"/>
Now this hath teaching in it, and ſhews the Sente of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi>'s Words very fully no doubt. ut to tell the World, becauſe God ſaved, and covenanted with <hi>Noah</hi>'s Family; therefore God takes whole Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in Goſpel times into Covenant, argues great dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, we deny not but his Family was taken into Covenant with God, even his natural Seed as ſuch, but it was a covenant of peculia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; for ſimply conſidered, as a Family they were not taken into the Covenant of Grace; becauſe there where ſome godly Families that had no lot or part in that Covenant, but we having fully opened the two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Covenant God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; I ſhall not renew the Argument again.</p>
            <p>But worthy <hi>Brittains,</hi> let this be well conſidered by you, that as <hi>Noah</hi>'s Family and <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family were taken into Covenant with God and other, whole Houſholds under the Law, and the whole Houſe and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo they were Types of the Goſpel Church, even as the whole Houſe or Family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> (or whole Houſe and Family of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were typically rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and federally holy;) it did prefigure that true ſpiritual Holineſs, that in Goſpel times ſhould be in all the members of the true Goſpel Church, and not of God's taking under the Goſpel whole Families in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenant with himſelf, either into an outward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Covenant, or into a ſpiritual or new Covenant relation with himſelf.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, God perhaps hath ſometimes called whole Families, both Parents, Children and Servants, and converted them all; but alaſs, how many Families are there, where may be, but one is called, and in ſacred Covenant with God, may be the Husband and not the Wife, the Wife and not the Husband, the Child, and not either of the Parents are ſo called and taken into Covenant with God. Pray <hi>worthy Brittains,</hi> conſider well what God ſpeaks of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe under the Goſpel. <hi>I will take one of a City, and two of a Family, and will bring you to</hi> Zion. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 14. Not in Goſpel times whole Families, no no, this God may do, but 'tis more then he hath promiſed; or as to matter of Fact is ſo; he doth frequently ſpeak in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:65865:120"/>
I may ſpeak here as the Apoſtles ſpeaks in another Caſe, <hi>you ſee your calling Brethren, how not many whole Families are called.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe God made a Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his natural Seed, as ſuch, as a Covenant of peculiarality, and alſo with him made or renewed the Covenant of Grace, ſetting him up as a covenanting Head on a double reſpect; doth it follow, that every believing Man is ſet or placed by the Lord, as a like Covenant head to all his natural Off-ſpring: Till Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> hath proved this, he ſaith nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>In the Covenant of Circumciſion that appertained to all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, were many external Priviledges and Promiſes made, of which Circumſion was given as a Sign or Token, as particularly the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But what Priviledges and Promiſes hath God gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Believers Children, as ſuch, in Goſpel times which Baptiſm gives them an aſſurance of; the ſign is nothing without the ſubſtance or thing ſignified; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have the ſubſtance or the things ſignified in Baptiſm, ſo have not Infants in their pretended Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, nor many of them ever after.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whereas you call for a plain Scripture to prove that the Children of the Faithful are rent from the Head of the Family; you miſtake the Buſineſs; you muſt prove that in the Goſpel Diſpenſation, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants, or whole Houſholds are taken with the Heads of thoſe Houſholds into Covenant with God: What whole Nation is taken into Covenant with God, as the whole Houſe or Nation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law; prove, that there is ſuch a Nation, and we will grant, that all the Families in that Nation, are alſo in Covenant, for in that univerſal Family all particular Families muſt needs be comprehended.</p>
            <p>You proceed to the Goſpel times, and mention <q>
                  <hi>Zacheus,</hi> who as ſoon as converted, the Lord Jeſus ſaid, <hi>this day is Salvation comé to this Houſe, for as much as he alſo is a Son of</hi> Abraham, <hi>Luke,</hi> 19. 9 10.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, you do your Buſineſs effectually, if you can prove, that ſo ſoon as the Father believes, Salvation comes to belong to all that are in his Houſe; I thought you argued for ſome external Priviledge,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65865:121"/>
only for the Children upon their Parents Faith; but it appears, 'tis no leſs then Salvation it ſelf, even eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation; for it was ſuch a Salvation that came to <hi>Zacheus</hi> that day. O happy Children of Believers if this were true! For then it follows, that all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the faithful muſt of neceſſity be ſaved, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they in their own Perſons believe or not; nay, and happy Servants too, for they muſt all be ſaved, becauſe part of the Family; but what credit is there to be given to a Man that talks after the manner as you do, is this true or falſe? for what do you mean leſs then what I ſay and doth; Eternal Salvation come to all in that Family or Houſe, when the Head of it doth believe, you ought to repent for ſpreading ſuch grand errors among the People.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Chriſt you ſay, explaineth <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. which God made with him and his Family, or his Seed, becauſe he was a Son to <hi>Abraham;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, though this Man hath been a great Sinner, and though he hath been chief Publican, yet becauſe he did repent, and receive the mediator of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant, and the Priviledges thereof do belong unto him, and to his Houſhold. He is a Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> therefore <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant belongs to him, in the ſame La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to him and his Seed; many judge that <hi>Zacheus</hi> was one of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> for uſually ſuch were <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> and this they gather from theſe words of Chriſt, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſo much as he alſo is a Son of</hi> Abraham; he alſo, though he is not a natural Seed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet he is one of his Spiritual Seed, and therefore <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant belongs unto him and his Houſhold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, your own explanation of this Text overthrows all you ſtrive to prove, were it but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For you grant he was not one of the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> now we ſay, that all that do believe are the Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo ſuch to whom the Covenant of Grace, God made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> (and conſequently eternal Life) doth belong; for the true Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> cannot miſs of eternal Salvation, <hi>the promiſe is ſure to all the Seed,</hi> Rom. 4. 16. Now then if your Eyes were opened, you might
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:65865:121"/>
quickly ſee that <hi>Abraham</hi> was a two-fold Father, and that he had a two-fold Seed; you know that all <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> natural Seed, and the natural Seed of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, are not the Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor have the promiſe of Salvation ſure to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From hence it appears, Salvation could not come to <hi>Zacheus</hi> Children, (if he had any) unleſs they as well as himſelf did believe, and receive by Faith the Bleſſing of the Covenant of Grace God made with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham;</hi> becauſe none are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Sons or Spiritual Seed, but Believers only, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> if <hi>you be Chriſts,</hi> then <hi>you are Abraham</hi>'s Seed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Therefore if Salvation came to every individual Perſon in <hi>Zacheus</hi> Family, they all did believe as well as himſelf, though it be not expreſſed. But,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Salvation might be ſaid to come to his Houſe, becauſe the Saviour and means of Salvation was that day come to his Houſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Salvation might be ſaid to come to his Houſe that day, though it came only to <hi>Zacheus</hi> himſelf, it coming to the head of the Family, it may be ſaid to come to his Houſe, and yet not to every particular Perſon in that Houſe, but you bring in this Objection, <hi>viz. but what is this to Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You anſwer, if Salvation came to his Houſe or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, then Baptiſm belonged unto them.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <q>It is probable, that <hi>Zacheus</hi> and his Houſhold were baptized before by <hi>John,</hi> for the <hi>Publicans</hi> came to be baptized of him, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 12. and 7. 29.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, you may be ſure when <hi>Zacheus</hi> believed in Chriſt, he was a proper Subject of Goſpel Baptiſm, ſo were all that believed who were in his Houſe; but the Text doth not ſay, that every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſon that were in his Houſe believed, or that Salvation came ſo to his Houſe, but if it did, no doubt they were all upon their believing baptized.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But you may well ſay, what is this to Baptiſm, ſince he and all his Houſe were baptized before, even when he was in his Sins, and a notorious Sinner, the chief of the <hi>Publicans; it is probable ſay you,</hi> ſure Sir, 'tis more then probable, it was impoſſible, that <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> and his Family ſhould eſcape Baptiſm, when <hi>John</hi> had baptized all the whole Country before, all,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:65865:122"/>
yea every individual Perſon that dwelt in <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Judea,</hi> and all the Regions round about: The truth is, this is very impertinently brought in to prove Infant Baptiſm; what doth it ſignifie, that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was come to <hi>Zacheus</hi> that day, and not until then, ſeeing <hi>John</hi>'s Commiſſion was to baptize all, whether Godly or Ungodly, Believers or Unbelievers, whether Salvation was come to them or not; let the Reader obſerve, what darkneſs and ignorance this Man ſhews.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> (ſay you) when he firſt planted the Chriſtian Religion among the <hi>Jews,</hi> exhorted them ſaying, <hi>be baptized every one of you, for the promiſe is to you, and to your Children.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This of the promiſe being unto them and to their Children, we have fully already anſwered; but why doth <hi>Peter</hi> command theſe <hi>Jews</hi> (who doubtleſs dwelt at <hi>Jeruſalem)</hi> to be baptized, ſeeing <hi>John</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt had baptized them and their Children before, as you have poſitively aſſerted; what muſt they be all rebaptized, what inconſiſtency is there in your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The latitude of this Command, <hi>be baptized eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you,</hi> is no further then to all them that he commands to repent, nor is the promiſe to any of their Children, but ſuch that the Lord our God ſhall all the Parents right and intereſt to the promiſe of the Holy Spirit, Remiſſion of Sins, and eternal Life, ſpring from their Intereſt in Chriſt by Faith, and at that Door comes in the right and intereſt of all their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or Off-ſpring that are called by the effectual ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the word and ſpirit of God, 'tis the promiſe made to all the true ſpiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but are the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the natural Seed of Believers, as ſuch, or as ſo conſidered the ſpiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham?</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Had <hi>Lydia</hi> and her Family a right to Baptiſm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Proſelyte? I thought your Brethren always aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted her Childrens right thereunto by virtue of her Faith.</p>

2. You do not ſpeak of Infants as ſuch, but of all in the Family or Houſhold, <hi>viz.</hi> comprehending adult Sons and Daughters, Men Servants or Maid Servants; adult perſons it appears from hence, in the primitive times were baptized, by virtue of the Parents Faith as well as Babes; nay, and were ſaved alſo by the Faith of the head of the Family.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Doth it not alſo follow, that your ignorance of God's Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> is very great, for if it be as you ſay, then all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed according to the Fleſh muſt be ſaved, becauſe he as the Head of his Family believed; but doth not the Scripture ſay in oppoſition to this, that <hi>though the number of the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>be as the Sand of the Sea, yet but a Remnant ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. May not this Doctrine of yours alſo corrupt and tend to ruine many poor Souls, both Children and Servants, who live in Families where the Heads of thoſe Families do believe, and are Godly; may not they ſay we ſhall be ſaved, though we believe not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we dwell in a Family where the Head, <hi>viz.</hi> our Father, our Maſter doth believe; Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> aſſures us, we ſhall all be ſaved, becauſe our Father or Maſter believes, <hi>be aſtoniſh'd, Oh ye Heavens!</hi> is this your proof for Infant Baptiſm. <hi>Worthy Brittains,</hi> this may ſufficiently ſhew you that the Covenant that God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> namely, the Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſion, which was made with him and his natural Seed as ſuch, was no Covenant of Salvation, and ſo not the Covenent of Grace; 'tis ſo plain you need not doubt of it, becauſe multitudes that were in that Covenant periſhed, though Circumciſion was a Seal of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith, yet not a Seal of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace to his Seed, as ſuch, becauſe if it were it would have Sealed to them all, the righteouſneſs of Faith and eternal Life, which we know it never did to multitudes of them.

               <p n="2">2.

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1.

So ſay we by whole Houſes that were ſaid to be baptized, none are meant but thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult Perſons who believed.</p>
            <p>2. You ſay and confeſs, that <hi>Cornelius</hi> and all his Houſe feared God, and that the <hi>Goaler</hi> and all his Houſe believed, that is all the adult (ſay you) believed, or that were at age to believe; this may ſerve to clear up the matter touching all the other whole Houſholds that were ſaid to be baptized, God conſtrains you to ſpeak the Truth here, though it be to overthrow your whole Argument.</p>

2. But what you ſpeak in the next place is not true, <hi>viz.</hi> that Parents and their Children, and Bond Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and their Children, were under the Law, and under the Goſpel times; alſo in the Covenant of Grace, through the Faith of their Parents: For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Bond-men and their Male Children were commanded to be Circumciſed that were in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Family, and that were as Proſelytes received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other Families of the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Law, yet they were not Heirs of the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> none but the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> could haue any poſſeſſion therein, according to that Covenant of peculiarality God made with the fleſhy Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> as ſuch, which typified forth that none but Believers, or the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of God, who are the true Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> were the true Heirs of the Promiſe, and of the Heavenly <hi>Canaan;</hi> will you ſay that all the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and Bond-Men and their Children as ſuch, and alſo all the natural Seed of Believers as ſuch, are the true Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> ſure God will take of this Vail from your Eyes, and open your underſtanding if you look to him by Prayer, and ſearch the Scripture with a canded deſire after the knowledge of this matter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You will find a great difference between the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that peculiarly did appertain to the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> as ſuch, and the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his true Spiritual Seed as ſuch.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I have proved that neither <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith nor the Parents Faith intitles any of their natural Seed as ſuch, to the inheritance or bleſſings purchaſed by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>viz. Juſtification, Adoption, Pardon of Sin, and eternal Life,</hi> no, no, <hi>the Children of the Fleſh,</hi> (as ſuch) <hi>theſe are not the Children of God, but the Children of the promiſe are counted for the Seed,</hi> viz. thoſe that are the elect of God only, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6, 7, 8, 9. are the Children of the premiſe, and Heirs of Glory; the promiſe runs Gal. 3. 16. <hi>not to Seeds as of many, but to thy Seed which is Chriſt,</hi> i. e. Chriſt perſonally conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>primarily,</hi> and then to Chriſt myſtically conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is all that are ſpiritually united to him; therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Verſe 29. if ye be Chriſts,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:65865:126"/>
then are you</hi> Abraham's <hi>Seed and Heirs according to the promiſe,</hi> or according to the Covenant of Grace God made with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. This muſt be ſo, becauſe the Covenant of Grace is well ordered in all things and ſure; ſee once again, <hi>Rom. 4. 14. for if they which are of the Law be Heirs, Faith is made void, and the promiſe of no effect,</hi> no need of Faith, if the legal Covenant can ſave any Man; but if a perſonal Obedience to the Law could not ſave the Parent, beſure the Faith and Obedience of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent cannot ſave the Child. But obſerve, verſ. 16. <hi>therefore it is of Faith, that it might be by Grace to the end, the promiſe might be ſure to all the Seed.</hi> Now conſider well the promiſe is eternal Life, this all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand here, and this ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> is ſure to all the Seed; 'tis confirmed not only by the word of God, but by the Oath of God alſo, Heb. 6. 13 <hi>for when God made promiſe to</hi> Abraham <hi>becauſe he could ſwear by no greater, he ſwore by himſelf; to ſhew the Heirs of the Promiſe, the immutability of his Counſel, he confirmed it by an Oath—that ſo the Heirs of the promiſe might have ſtrong Conſolation,</hi> verſ. 17. 18. all that are the true Heirs or ſpiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt be ſaved, for 'tis impoſſible for God to lye, or fail in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, to any one of rhe true Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if all the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> were in this Covenant, and all the natural Seed of Believers, 'tis impoſſible that any one of them ſhould periſh eternally, or miſs of eternal Life.</p>
            <p>They are all born of God, and Heirs as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was, they are all choſen from Everlaſting to Salvation, they are all given to Chriſt, and all Members of his myſtical Body, or are but one myſtical Chriſt, and are even <hi>Fleſh of his Fleſh, and Bone of his Bone,</hi> and therefore this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and free promiſe of God, cannot appertain to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed as ſuch, nor to the natural Seed of Believers as ſuch, for alaſs! how many of them do periſh eternally? <hi>For though the number of the Children of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>be as the Sands of the Sea, yet but a remnant of them ſhall be ſaved,</hi> as was hinted before.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But ſay you, if the keeper of the Priſon had no Children, or if they were the adult, it is the ſame thing, the Apoſtle offereth Salvation to him and to

            <p>2.

1. If there were no Families or Houſholds, but in which there are ſome Infants, you might have ſome pretence for what you infer from hence; but how pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable is it, that there are every where many whole Families, in which there is no Infant or Child in non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and this being so, what certain Concluſion or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence can he drawn from hence?</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="3">3.

And thus it appears to all impartial Perſons, that there is nothing in this argument touching the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Goſpel Church; hears no mention made in baptizing whole Houſholds of one Infant baptized, nor the leaſt color of reaſon to conclude there were.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Burkit</hi> is ſo unreaſonable as to put us upon ſearching the Scripture to prove a Negative, <hi>i. e.</hi> that there were none baptized in Infancy; we might as well have deſired him to give proof that there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any Infant ordained an Elder, or Paſtor of a Church; or how can we prove they did not make uſe of <hi>Honey</hi> or <hi>Oil</hi> in Baptiſm, which ſome of the ancient Fathers uſed, as Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> Notes, or <hi>Salt</hi> or <hi>Spittle,</hi> which practice is ſtill in the <hi>Romiſh Church?</hi> Where is the extream <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <q>But ſays Mr. <hi>Burkit,</hi> ſearch the Scripture, and produce me any one inſtance if you can from the time of St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, to the time of St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, which was more than threeſcore Years, during which time many Thouſands of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were grown up to maturity, and make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear there were not any baptized in their Infancy, or that their Baptiſm was deferred till riper years, or that there is any divine Command for the delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the baptiſm of Children of Chriſtian Parents, until they are grown up, and I will frankly yield the Cauſe. <hi>Bravely ſpoken.</hi>

               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:65865:129"/>
Reader, obſerve Mr. <hi>Burkit,</hi> ſays in the Goſpel day, and when our Saviour ſent his Diſciples firſt to preach, they were to teach or make Diſciples of thoſe they baptized; but upon the Parents believing and being baptized, he ſays, their Children were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Baptiſm alſo. Now ſay I, ſince many Parents thus taught and baptized, had multitudes of Infants born to them; how comes it about that we read not of one of their Infants that were baptized, no not from the time of <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, to the Death of <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt? Can any Man think, had any Infants been baptized, that God would not have left ſome account of it, to put the matter out of doubt, eſpecially ſince it was never taught Doctrinally nor Commanded? Certainly, it could not ſtand conſiſtent with the Care, Wiſdom and Faithfulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, to have hid and concealed ſuch a Practice, had there been one Infant by his Authority or Allowance baptized. But ſince the Scripture is ſilent in it, we may aſſure our Selves 'tis not the will of God, Infants ſhould be be baptized. Alſo if thoſe who were to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed were firſt to be taught, were firſt to repent and believe, Then it follows clearly, that Baptiſm muſt be deferred till Children were ofripe Years, and able ſo to do, and did not <hi>Mary</hi> delay the baptizing of the Holy Child Jeſus-</p>
            <p>
               <q>As to the Houſe of <hi>Crispus,</hi> you your ſelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, they all believed, theſe are your words, <hi>viz.</hi> it is true, all the Houſe of <hi>Crispus</hi> were Believers, <hi>viz.</hi> Adult Perſons, but ſay you, were all the Houſholds of the Faithful Barren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> No doubt but in ſome of thoſe Houſholds were Children, they might not be all Barren with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Children, yet their Children might be grown up to maturity; but you your ſelf have proved that whole Houſes may be ſaid to be baptized, and yet none but the Adult in thoſe Houſholds might be baptized, ſeeing the Scripture you quoted, ſaith, that <hi>Sampſon</hi> was buried by all his Fathers Houſe, yet none of the little Children in that Houſe could be concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that matter.</p>
            <p>As to the Houſe of <hi>Stephanas</hi> you ſay well, they are called the firſt Fruits of <hi>Achaia. I beſeech you Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:65865:130"/>
ye know the Houſhold of</hi> Stephanas, <hi>that is the firſt Fruits of</hi> Achaia, <hi>and that they have addicted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the miniſtry of the Saints,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 15. <hi>that you ſubmit your ſelves to ſuch,</hi> verſ. 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> They, that is the whole Houſhold gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to adminiſter to the Saints, but beſure little Babes could not do that, nor ought the Adult to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to little Children, or eſteem and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence them for acts of Charity.</p>
            <p>You bring in this Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>we do not read of any Infant that were in thoſe Houſholds, to which you anſwer, if the Houſholds of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> when the Apoſtle baptized them were ſo barren, what need had the Apoſtle to write unto them that their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were holy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. it is more than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that Children were in every Houſhold that was baptized.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Now you go over again with your former argument, and repeat the ſame things which I have again and again anſwer'd, about the Childs being in Covenant, after the Head of the Family or the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents do believe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſay, 'tis very probable there might be no Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in non-age in thoſe Houſholds, becauſe 'tis ſaid, the whole Houſe had believed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If there were yet by your own grant, all the Houſe might be ſaid to be baptized, and yet no little Children baptized that might be in thoſe Houſholds, becauſe <hi>all</hi> is often taken but for a part.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But will you ſaid I build an Ordinance upon a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and on uncertain Conſequences; nay one of the ſacred Inſtitutions of the Goſpel, called one of the two great Sacraments thereof; that Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. we have already anſwered. Now from the whole, we ſhall draw Concluſions in oppoſition to yours.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Covenant that God made with <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family, was a Covenant made with all the World, and ſo not the Covenant of Grace, though there was Mercy and Grace contained in it to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and to the Fowls of the Air, and Beaſts of the Field alſo.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:65865:130"/>
2. That God's taking all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family or Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold into Covenant as ſuch, it was only a Covenant that peculiarly appertained to his natural Seed, and it had many Temporal Bleſſings and Priviledges attending it, which no Houſhold under the Goſpel can pretend unto, and of this Covenant Circumciſion was a ſign, and that Circumſion was only given to be a <hi>Seal of the righteouſneſs of Faith</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> only, and not to little Children.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> as ſuch, or the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> under the Law were all as ſo conſidered then, the Church of God, and that the Goſpel Church conſiſteth not of whole Houſholds or any one whole Nation, it being not of an Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Conſtitution, but Congregational only, conſiſting of none but of believers, baptized upon the profeſſion of their Faith who are called the <hi>Houſhold of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was a typical Church, who were holy with a <hi>Ceremonial</hi> and <hi>Typical Holineſs,</hi> ſignifiing that all the Members of the Goſpel Church, ſhould be ſpiritually and ſavingly Holy.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That God in the Goſpel times, (though now and then he is pleaſed to call by his Grace, all or the greateſt part of whole Families, yet contrary to the old Covenant) he uſually now takes but two of a City and one of a Family, and brings them into his true Goſpel <hi>Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. That the firſt Churches were only planted of ſuch that believed, ſome out of one Family, and ſome out of other Families, and that out of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, and ſuch that were called of the Gentile Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That the Parents Faith ſaves none of his Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, either Children or Servants, nor gives them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny right to Goſpel Baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Laſtly, one would think theſe things to be clear enough to give Satisfaction to all that deſire Satisfaction about Infant Baptiſm, and that there is not the leaſt ſhadow of proof for it from what our Brethren argue, from whole Families who were ſaid to be baptized, if we compare Scripture with Scripture, for as we find, no Precept nor Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for Infant Baptiſm, ſo not any Conſequence

            <p>The firſt is <hi>Calvin</hi> a latter Writer, I know not but <hi>Ireneus</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> might be both had out of him: I do confeſs, <hi>Ireneus</hi> lived not above Two Hundred Years after Chriſt; or in the ſecond Century, thus he and many others cite him, <hi>viz.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Reader, pray obſerve, here is not a word of one Infant baptized; but this Man infers it from his Words, ſo that we have nothing but Conſequences, neither from God's Word, nor the words of Man. Chriſt, no doubt, came to ſave ſome of all ſorts of Men, and who doubts but he came to ſave Infants, and little ones, Young and Old? But why muſt theſe Words <hi>[who are born again]</hi> be applyed to Infant Baptiſm. The ſcope of <hi>Ireneas</hi> in that <hi>Chapter,</hi> is to refute the Gnoſticks, who ſaid that Chriſt did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed One and Thirty Years of age; againſt whom <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reneus</hi> alledged that Chriſt lived in every age, <hi>i. e.</hi> of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, Youth, and old Age, that by his Age and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he might ſanctifie every age. So that here <hi>Ireneus</hi> ſpeaks not of being born again in Baptiſm; for he ſaith, <hi>Omnes inquam, qui per eum renaſcuntur in Deum;</hi> i. e. I ſay, all which are born again by him to God, <hi>i. e.</hi> by Chriſt, not as if he had baptized Infants, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he <hi>(i. e.</hi> Chriſt) was an Infant, that by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample or virtue of his Age, he might ſanctifie Infants, as the whole Diſcourſe in Latin plainly ſhews, <hi>viz.

I grant, (ſaith he) it was practiſed in <hi>Africa</hi> before that time, and they, or ſome of them thought well of it. And though that is no argument for us to think ſo, yet none of them ever pretended it to be neceſſary, nor to have been a precept of the Goſpel.

               <q>That there is a Tradition to baptize Infants, relies but upon two Witneſſes, <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and the latter having it from the former, it lies upon a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Teſtimony, which (ſaith he) is a pittiful argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove a Tradition Apoſtolical. He is the firſt that ſpoke of it; but <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that was before him, ſeems to ſpeak againſt it, which he would not have done, if it had been an Apoſtolical Tradition; and that it was not ſo, is but too certain, if there be any Truth in the Words of <hi>Ludovicus Vives,</hi> who ſays, that anciently none were baptized, but Perſons of ripe Age.</q>

               <p> Of thoſe who dye without Baptiſm, gives us an Inſtance in thoſe to whom Baptiſm was not admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by reaſon of Infancy. And the ſame <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> though he was a Biſhops Son, being a long time bred up under his Fathers care, was not, ſaith the ſaid Dr, baptized till he came to Man's Age. In like manner (ſaith he) <hi>Baſil</hi> the Great that was born of devout Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and inſtructed from his Childhood, was not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized until a Man, <hi>p.</hi> 280. Alſo, ſaith he, <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> called afterwards <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> was born of Chriſtian Parents, as the truer Opinion is, tutored by the famous Biſhop <hi>Miletius,</hi> was not yet baptized, till he was One and Twenty Years of Age.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hierom,</hi> alſo <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who were born of Chriſtian Parents, and conſecrated to Chriſtian Diſcipline, even from their Childhood, were not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized before thirty years of age, as Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Down</hi> aſſerts in his Twelfth Section of the Life of Chriſt.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Now, Sir here are Examples enough that do prove in the primitive times, Children of baptized Believers were not baptized, but had their Baptiſm delayed till they themſelves believed, and gave an account of their Faith. Had it been the conſtant cuſtom of the Godly to baptize Infants, would not theſe, think you, have been in their Infancy baptized?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grotius,</hi> as I find him quoted by Dr. <hi>Du-Veil,</hi> ſaith, </p>

               <p>The Primitive Churches did not baptize Infants, ſee <hi>Grotius</hi>'s Notes on the Goſpel.</p>

Nay, (ſaith the ſame great and learned Author,) it doth moſt plainly appear by the right of baptizing in the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> for baptiſm is to be asked before the Perſon to be baptized do enter into the Church, which the <hi>ſurety does in the Infants Name,</hi> a clear di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct confeſſion of Faith is required, which the ſame ſurety rehearſeth in the Infants Name, <hi>i. e.</hi> a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of the World, its Pomps, the Fleſh, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p> We may by this perceive from whence the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of our old Church Catechiſm came.</hi> But this is a clear Argument, ſaith the Dr. to prove of old, the Perſons who were to be baptized, themſelves asked Baptiſm in their own Name, and of their own choice, and profeſſed their own Faith.</p>
            </q>
            <p>In the <hi>Neo-Ceſarean Council</hi> it was framed thus. <q>As to thoſe who are big with Child, they ought to be baptized when they will, for in this Secrament there is nothing common to her that brings forth, and that which ſhall be brought forth from her Womb, because in that Confeſſion, the Liberty of every ones Choice is declared.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Whence we may infer, 1. That in that age, there ſeemed to be that averſneſs from baptizing Children, that they were not willing to admit Women great with Child to Baptiſm, leſt it ſhould be thought that the Child was baptized with them.</p>
            <p>2. That in thoſe times in the Confeſſion of Faith, in the Death, Burial, and Reſurrection of Chriſt, which was done in a Publick and Solemn manner in their Baptiſm, a liberty of Choice and Conſent was required as preparatory to it; for the incapacity of the Infant in the Womb, to declare this Choice and Conſent, is the reaſon why they conclude that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant was not baptized with the Mother.</p>
            <p>3. That it was then judg'd neceſſary to have the Conſent and Choice of thoſe who were to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Du-Veil,</hi> citing the ſame Synod on this paſſage <hi>(viz. that concerning the Baptiſm of a Woman with Child, that her Baptiſm concerns not her Child, for every one is to give a demonſtration of his own Faith and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion)</hi> ſaith, <q>however the interpreters draw it to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother purpoſe; it does appear that the Queſtion
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:65865:135"/>
was made of a Woman big with Child, becauſe it did ſeem that the Child was baptized together with the Mother, which notwitſtanding ought not to be uſed, nor to be baptized, except of its own proper Election and Profeſſion.</q>

            <p>Sir, What think you now of the Teſtimony of the ancient Fathers, and of the practice of the Churches after the Apoſtles days? Sure the Reader muſt needs
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:65865:136"/>
conclude, we have the advantage here too, and you muſt yield whether you will or no, and give up the Controverſie.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, <q>Your firſt Demonſtration to prove Infant Baptiſm in the days after the Apoſtles is this, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe that Children had Hands laid upon them in their Minority.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This ſignifies nothing, for as the Fathers chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Ordinance of Baptiſm from believing Men and Women to ignorant Babes, ſo they changed impoſition of Hands (which I own to be a principle of Chriſt's Doctrine, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 12) to ſuch young People, who in their Minority had learned the Articles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith. But clear it is, in the primitive Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical times, none but baptized Believers were admitted to that Ordinance of <hi>laying on of Hands,</hi> as <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 14. and 19. 6.</p>
            <p>But your Brother Mr. <hi>Burkit</hi> acknowledgeth, <hi>that formerly there were ſuch called</hi> Catechumeni, <hi>Perſons taught or inſtructed, and afterwards baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſaith further, <hi>that there were two ſorts,</hi> the laſt he brings for his purpoſe, but I know not where he hath his Teſtimony, and therefore paſs it by.</p>
            <p>So much to your firſt Demonſtration from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>Your ſecond Demonſtration to prove Infant Baptiſm is this, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>becauſe in the primitive times Infants were admitted to the Lord's Supper, therefore you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude they were admitted to Baptiſm.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> And they had (ſay I) as much Ground for the one as for the other, and there is the ſame parity of reaſon to conclude, as they erred in one, ſo they did in the other.</p>
            <p>Why doth you not from hence give Infants alſo the Lord's Supper? The Reaſon you give I have before proved inſignificant.</p>
            <p>As to his third Demonſtration, it is not denyed but that Infant Baptiſm was received in the Church in the third and fourth Century, with many other Fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries, but that doth him no kindneſs; the Church was adulterated from the true Apoſtolical Faith and Practice, in many Reſpects in thoſe and after times downwards.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:65865:136"/>
His fourth Demonſtration is this, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>If it was a groſs Error in the Primitive Fathers to admit Infants to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, then they in ſuffering ſuch an Error to paſs uncen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured and uncondemned, were guilty of the greateſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> What then? I ask him and you, or any other of our Oppoſers, whether ye do not believe for ſeveral Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries thoſe Fathers who admitted Infants to the Lord's Supper without <hi>cenſuring</hi> or <hi>condemning</hi> it, were not guilty alſo of as great Impurity? Beſides, did not the ſame Fathers hold other Errors? See Mr. <hi>Perkins Demonſt. of the Problem, pag.</hi> 488. Theſe are his Words, <hi>viz.</hi> 
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>And whereas ſome Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>viz. Ireneus, Juſtin, Clement, Tertullian,</hi> held that the Law of Nature had power to ſave the Gentiles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt. And again he ſaith,</p>
               <p> The Fathers have Errors, yea and ſometimes groſs ones. Doth not Hiſtory tell us the Fathers uſed other Rites alſo, and that in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm? See <hi>Perkins, p.</hi> 549. The Fathers, ſaith he, uſed ſome other Rites and Ceremonies which are now omitted, as <hi>Kiſſing of the Child,</hi> which was baptized, in <hi>Cyprian, l. 3. ep.</hi> 8. uſe of Milk and Honey, uſe of Milk and Wine, <hi>Hierom</hi> in <hi>Iſ. c.</hi> 55.</p>
            </q>
            <p> It was an uſe for the Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer to blow in the Face of the Baptized; and the Party baptized uſed to Exuffiate the Devil, whom he renounced. What Credit is to be given to ſuch Fathers?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith, <q>That Infant-Baptiſm was ſo generally in the Church of God, that the <hi>Pelagians</hi> could not deny it, tho they denied Original Sin, againſt the which it was a Medicine. And that <hi>Bernard,</hi> who lived between the Year 1091, and the Year 1153, declareth it was the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church in thoſe Ages.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We deny not, but readily grant, that the Baptiſm of Infants was in the Church long before that time: And remarkable 'tis, that about 1091 or 1100, Popiſh Darkneſs was at its greateſt height. And was it any wonder thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers gave Baptiſm to Infants when it was the Practice of thoſe times before <hi>Bernard,</hi> to give Infants the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per alſo, as well as Baptiſm? Which Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> knows well enough, if he hath read any thing of Hiſtory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Bernard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith, <q>Cenſur'd thoſe who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Infant-Baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

1. From whence it appears there were ſome Chriſtians who oppoſed Infant-Baptiſm even in the darkeſt time of <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. What Wonder is it to hear that ſuch in thoſe corrupt times, who deny'd Infant-Baptiſm, were cenſured, when we who do deny it now, are ſo unrighteouſly cenſured by you and your Brethren, notwithſtanding ſuch clear Light in theſe days is broken forth?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> alſo endeavoureth to prove, that the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> were for Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>And he ſeems to charge Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> and Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> for aſſerting the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer, I ſee no reaſon why he ſhould condemn Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> or Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> in this matter; for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſome Hiſtories it appears, that the <hi>Antient Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Antient Britains,</hi> were for the Baptizing of Believers: ſee D. <hi>Balthazar Lidius,</hi> in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Church, <hi>p. 2. col.</hi> 2. out of <hi>Renarius,</hi> and <hi>G. Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> in his Book called <hi>De Hiſtoria Aurelii Ambroſii.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Learned <hi>Uſher,</hi> in his Book of the State of the Chriſtian Church, as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> obſerves, <hi>p.</hi> 237. ſhews, that they deſended Believers-Baptiſm in oppoſition to that of Infants: ſee <hi>Moreland, Book 1. c. 4. p.</hi> 67. yet no doubt but ſome of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> might be for Infant-Baptiſm. Yet Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> confeſſeth that <hi>Bernard</hi> acknowledgeth that Hiſtory doth ſpeak of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> denying Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, tho he would fain have it from what the ſaid <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> ſaith, to be a Slander caſt upon them by their Enemies the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> Let it be how it will concerning them, know, Noble <hi>Britains,</hi> that we build not our Faith about Baptiſm upon the Practice and Cuſtom of Men, Fathers, General Councils, Proteſtant Reformers or Churches; but upon the Word of God.</p>
            <p>To conclude with this Argument: From hence we infer, that the practice of the Church under the Romiſh Apoſtacy of Infant-Baptiſm, in every Age, ſince the firſt Centuries unto theſe Times, is no good Proof for it. What tho <hi>Calvis</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> two famous Proteſtant Reformers, and many other Modern Divines were, and many Godly and Learned Men are now for this Tradition; Muſt it be therefore a Truth? Muſt our Faith ſtand in the Wiſdom of Men in this matter, or in the Power of God, and in the Authority of his Sacred Word? Our firſt <hi>Proteſtant Reformers</hi> were raiſed

up to reſtore thoſe Grand Fundamentals of Faith, more than to reform Matters of Diſcipline, and about this Rite of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm and ſome other Ceremonies. <hi>The Path of the Juſt is as a ſhining Light, that ſhines more and more to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Day,</hi> Prov. 4. 18.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You Hint, that not one queſtioned the Privilege of Children to Baptiſm, until the Adverſary came while Men ſlept, and ſowed Tares among the Wheat.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sir, you miſtake, it was <hi>while Men ſlept</hi> that the Enemy firſt ſowed the evil Seed of <hi>Babes-Baptiſm</hi> in the Church. Moreover, the Baptiſm of Believers, in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Infant-Baptiſm, I have proved is no part of thoſe Tares the Adverſary hath ſowed, but it is Seed which Jeſus Chriſt himſelf sowed, or 'tis (I mean) his own holy Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>

            <argument>
               <p>Shewing that <hi>Infant Baptiſm</hi> is no excellent way or means to plant the Chriſtian Religion, but a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing; and therefore in oppoſition to what Mr. <hi>James Owen</hi> ſaith, They ought not to be baptized: being an Anſwer to what he hath wrote in his 15th <hi>Chapter,</hi> and twelfth and laſt Argument.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <q>YOU ſay, <hi>Infant Baptiſm</hi> is an excellent means which God hath ordained for to plant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Church of God: Chriſt thus commanded his Apoſtles to gather Churches among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by teaching and baptizing them <hi>in the Name of the Father, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 28. 29.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer: The way it appears that Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Apoſtles to gather Churches among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> is firſt to teach them, and then baptize them; you ſay right whilſt you repeat the Text, but God hath not commanded to baptize Infants, and that way to plant his Church.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You add, It is an excellent means for this end, making Children to be Diſciples of Chriſt; let none marvel at this, becauſe Infants are of the number of Diſciples: <hi>Acts 15. 11. Why tempt ye God, to put a yoke on the necks of the Diſciples?</hi> Thoſe Diſciples were, ſay you, the Faithful and their Seed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is not true: The Diſciples, in the Text you cite, refer only to Believers among the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> thoſe falſe Teachers would have the Brethren be circumciſed, and they were they only that are called Diſciples.</p>
            <p>Theſe Brethren being <hi>Gentiles,</hi> were never circumciſed; and therefore theſe falſe Teachers taught them ſo to be, ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 1.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:65865:138"/>
2. Sir, I will appeal to your Conſcience in this matter, Is not a Diſciple one that is taught or inſtructed, and can Infants be called Diſciples, who are not capable of being taught?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Such that are made Diſciples by teaching, are the Subjects of Baptiſm according to the Commiſſion;</hi> and he is in the right.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Doth the baptizing of Infants make them Diſciples? Doth Chriſt ſay baptize, and ſo make them Diſciples? Or is it not, make Diſciples, and baptize them? <hi>Mathetuſate,</hi> diſciplize, and then it follows, baptize them.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ſay, Chriſt knoweth how to adminiſter a ſecret Doctrine to Infants, according to his promiſe, <hi>Thy Children ſhall be all taught of the Lord.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. No doubt but Chriſt is able to do it: But doth he in a ſecret way adminiſter Inſtruction to Infants? prove it, and alſo how you come to know it; for they muſt be known Diſciples, viſible Diſciples that are to be baptized.</p>
            <p>2. Are they little Infants that Promiſe refers to, <hi>i. e. Thy Children ſhall be all taught of God?</hi> They are <hi>Sion</hi>'s Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or ſuch that are born of God that are under that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, not Infants, or our Children as ſuch; for are all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers natural Offſpring taught of God when Babes, (or adult either?) O abominable abuſe of the holy Text!</p>
            <p>
               <q>Baptiſm (ſay you) ſetteth little Children under a particular obligation to be the Lord's; doubtleſs they can receive ſuch an obligation now as formerly they did, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 11, 12. And it is as certain that this Bond is a great advantage to make them willing when they come to age, God hath preſented them by the Grace of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. 'Tis you pretend to lay them under an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not by Chriſt's authority, prove he hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you ſo to do.</p>
            <p>2. Doth Baptiſm confer Grace? you ſeem to aſſert this, for elſe how hath God by Baptiſm prevented them? Your ſprinkling them with water doth not, cannot prevent them. I affirm therefore 'tis an obligation of man's deviſing, for you cannot prove it is of God's appointment; therefore to refuſe to bring them under ſuch an obligation is no <hi>fantaſtick</hi> thing, as you intimate it is. You ſay <hi>the mark of the Spirit is upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:65865:139"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Baptiſm is no mark of the Spirit to any but to ſuch who have the Spirit; and what a <hi>Mock-Baptiſm</hi> is it to give the Sign, where appears no demonſtration of the thing thereby ſignified?</p>
            <p>
               <q>(You ſay) on the other ſide, Satan hath not ſuch an advantage againſt thoſe that are baptized in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> How doth it appear that Satan hath not ſuch an advantage againſt your Children (as he hath againſt ours that were never baptized, as you call <hi>Rantiſm)</hi> I am ſure our Children generally are as ſober, and helped to eſcape Satan's ſnares as far forth as yours generally are. VVill God own or bleſs an humane Tradition? The Woman that <hi>Luther</hi> mentioned, no doubt might think ſhe was obliged to fear God by that ſort of Baptiſm ſhe had when ſhe was an Infant, yet God never obliged her to come under that obligation, but may be ſhe was baptized when a Believer.</p>
            <p>However the <hi>Papiſts</hi> may argue for their voluntary Vows after the ſame manner, <hi>viz.</hi> it is a great help and an advantage to them to preſerve them from ſin, and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Devil.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Infant-Baptiſm is an excellent means (you ſay) to plant the true Religion, and to continue the Church, by giving an advantage for the Miniſters of the Goſpel to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with ſuch when they come to age, far better than they can with thoſe that are not baptized, that they might call them to remembrance of their baptiſmal Vow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is certainly a grand miſtake; for inſtead of its being an advantage to Miniſters to reaſon with ſuch that were baptized in their Infancy, to remember their baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Vow, and ſo to believe and turn to God, 'tis apparent it may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inder them; for if thoſe perſons when grown up, do call to remembrance what you <hi>Pedobaptiſts</hi> have taught and told them, touching thoſe Bleſſings and Privileges they then received, it may rather take them off from ſeeking after either Faith or Repentance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For you tell them when their Parents believed, and were ſaved, they were made partakers of the ſame Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege and Bleſſing alſo; if ſo, what need they concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about getting perſonal Faith? you believe and teach them the Doctrine of final Perſeverance; no doubt ſuch who are in a ſtate of Grace, can never finally fall out of it.</p>

The Obligation and Vow that lies upon baptized per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons according to the Scripture, is not that they ſeek after Regeneration, no, for it neceſſarily ſuppoſeth that they had that before baptized; but it doth bind or oblige them to perſevere in Holineſs, that as they have been buried in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, as perſons <hi>dead to ſin,</hi> ſo they ſhould walk <hi>in newneſs of life,</hi> Rom. 6. 3, 4. Now you would have your Baptiſm to oblige your baptized Children to become dead to ſin, they were not it appears dead when buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm, but you bury them alive, (if you baptized them.) To ſhew them they muſt die, Sir, God never ordained Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to ſuch an end, or to oblige perſons thus to do, ſee <hi>Rom. 6. 3. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Col.</hi> 1. 12, 13.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Church of <hi>England</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Child which they baptize is thereby</hi> (that is in Baptiſm) <hi>regenerated, and made a Child of God, a Member of Chriſt, and an Inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And what you ſay implies as much; for it muſt needs be thus, if when the Parents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and are regenerated and ſaved, the Child partakes of the ſame privilege, then the Child believed and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, and ſaved alſo. Now if this be ſo, what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage can Miniſters have from the Conſideration of Infants Baptiſm to preſs Regeneration, or the Performance of Repentance upon them when they come to age, above what we have to preſs theſe great Duties upon our Children, when grown up that never were baptized? What need is there to preſs that on the Conſciences of your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren when they come to age, which they had wrought in them when they were in their Infancy? No, your Work is rather to preſs them as Saints and renewed Perſons, to live holy Lives, and improve thoſe Divine Habits which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived when their Parents believed, or thoſe inſpired Habits that were plauted in their Souls, when in Infancy they were baptized and regenerated.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Certainly your Children when they come to age may think that they received ſome mighty Privilege in their Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, by being in the Covenant of Grace with their Parents, and ſo in a State ſafe enough; for you tell them there is no final Falling from a State of true Grace. We and you too know that, and declare that the Covenant of Grace is ſure to all the true Seed or Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> of which Seed you declare all your natural Off-ſpring as ſuch are a part. This being ſo, it is evident that Miniſters have no Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages;
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65865:140"/>
but the contrary, in preſſing the neceſſity of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Converſion on your Children when at age, we have the greater advantage far in preaching to our Sons and Daughters, who tell them that our Faith did not, cannot profit them, or ſave them, no, but that they were born in ſin, and were Children of Wrath by Nature, and ſo remain till true actual Faith and Regeneration do paſs upon them, or they do believe in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Beſides, the Baptiſmal Vow you brought them under being not by God's Appointment, what Bleſſing can you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from thence? Will God own and bleſs a voluntary Vow, or approve of an Humane Tradition?</p>
            <p n="6">6. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> (as I hinted before) may expect as well, and from as good Ground and Authority, as great advantage to preſs Holineſs and Chaſtity upon thoſe that they bring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their voluntary Vows and Covenants in their <hi>Nunneries</hi> and <hi>Fryaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Beſides, your Children entred not into that Baptiſmal-Covenant you talk of by their own conſent; they knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, and can find no Authority from God's Word you had to bring them under it; and therefore what power is that like to have upon their Conſciences? Had you not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bring them under a ſolemn Vow to become good, and to repent as ſoon as they come to age; nay, bring them under an Oath, or cauſe them to enter into a ſolemn Covenant ſo to do, and ſet their Hands unto it? But you will ſay, you have no Command nor Warrant from God's Word to do that; no more, ſay we, have you any Command or Warrant from the Word of God to bring them under any ſuch Baptiſmal Vow, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <q>Infant-Baptiſm is ſo effectual to continue the true Religion, and the Encreaſe of the Church of God at this time, as Circumciſion formerly had been: It pleaſed God to continue true Religion among the Jews by bringing their Children under the Bond of the Covenant: He left them not to their own liberty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and let none take upon them to be wiſer than God by leaving Children at this time to follow their own Fancies, to chooſe their own Religion, without having God's Covenant upon them, for <hi>Humane Nature</hi> is as corruptible at this time as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>

            <p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:65865:140"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer; Circumciſion was God's abſolute and poſitive Command in the Jewiſh Church, which was natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; but God hath not commanded Infants to be baptized into the Goſpel-Church which is not National, but Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational: if therefore there was the like Authority from God for the one as there was for the other, we would contend with you no longer.</p>
            <p>2. 'Tis you that would ſeem wiſer than God, whoſe Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hath not led him to erect his Goſpel Church of ſuch Materials, or of ſuch Matter, and in ſuch Form now, as it was his Wiſdom to build the Jewiſh or Legal Church: Muſt the fleſhly Seed as ſuch be taken into the Goſpel-Church by Baptiſm, becauſe the Male-Infants were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed under the Law? Who tells you ſo? where is it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten? Will you be wiſer than God? Did not <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſay, <hi>Think not to ſay within your ſelves we have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father? Now the Ax is laid to the Root of the Tree.</hi> Now the caſe is altered, as if he ſhould ſay; <hi>Now we know no Man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Fleſh,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>3. Hath not God freely left us and our Children to chooſe to be his Servants, or to chooſe our Religion? Are not the Saints to be all Volunteers? Will Chriſt accept of <hi>Preſt-Souldiers</hi> into his Service? Or have you any power to force, or compel your Children to be of what Perſwaſion in Religion you pleaſe? God, it is true, hath no more left Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren now than formerly, to follow their own Fancies; no, God forbid: But he hath commanded them to <hi>believe and be baptized;</hi> and not to follow the Fancies of their Parents any more than to follow their own Fancies, nor Miniſters who teach them contrary Doctrine to that which the Word of God doth.</p>
            <p>4. As to the Corruption of our Nature, 'tis true that is as bad as ever; but your Sprinkling your Children in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy hath no Virtue or Power in it to change or purge out that Corruption; your Children receive no benefit by that you call Baptiſm: Say what you will, I am ſure you cannot prove they receive any profit thereby.</p>
            <p>5. I affirm God hath not commanded us to bring our Children into the Bond of the Covenant by Baptiſm until they believe, and you can never diſprove us while you live from God's Word.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ſay, the Lord hath bleſſed the Baptiſm of Infants to be a Means for the continuing of the true Religion, and of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65865:141"/>
the Chriſtian Church: From the days of the Apoſtles e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to this very day, the Lord beſtoweth his particular Bleſſings but upon his own Ordinance; he imprinteth not the Seal of Heaven upon earthly Inventions; none can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but that there are thouſands baptized in their Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that feel in themſelves the Virtue of their Baptiſm.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer; You cannot prove that God hath any manner of ways owned or bleſſed Infant-Baptiſm: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath continued a Seed to ſerve him in every Age ſince the Apoſtles time, will you attribute that to Infant-Baptiſm, which is only to be aſcribed to the rich and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Grace of God, and Power of his Spirit?</p>
            <p>2. As to the true Church, for many years ſhe was hid, and in the Wilderneſs ſhe fled from the face of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Beaſt and <hi>cruel Dragon, Rev.</hi> 12. I muſt confeſs Infant-Baptiſm hath in part been a means to keep up the name of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion in the Church ever ſince the <hi>Apoſtacy;</hi> and it was contrived no doubt to make the Church great and large, <hi>i. e.</hi> to make <hi>whole Families, Pariſhes,</hi> and <hi>Nations</hi> the Church, this is evident; and if this be the way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and enlarge the Church, the Lord deliver the true Church from ſuch a Practice and Invention of Men.</p>
            <p>I look upon Infant-Baptiſm to be one of the chief Pillars of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, and of all National Churches and Conſtitutions in the <hi>European</hi> World; this is that <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> that is ſo cried up, and the way of making and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing the pretended Chriſtian-Name; in the Anti-chriſtian Church, and World, all are made Chriſtians in their Infant-Baptiſm: And thus the Inhabitants of the Earth are cheated, and deluded with a Shadow and empty Name that ſignifies nothing, and certain I am, until <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> (as it is called) is <hi>Unchriſtianed</hi> of this pretended Rite, or <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and the Inhabitants of the Earth become new <hi>Chriſtianed,</hi> there will never be a thorough Reformation: I mean until they ſee that Chriſtianity, or Chriſtian-Name, which they received by their Infant-Baptiſm, ſignifies nothing, but throw it away as an Human Innovation, and labour after true Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or a likeneſs to Chriſt, and ſo believe and are baptized upon the profeſſion of their Faith, according as in the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Primitive Church: 'Tis Infant-Baptiſm that tends to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold all National Churches, and deceives poor People who think they were thereby made Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:65865:141"/>
3. Doth it follow, becauſe many Thouſands that were baptized (as you call it) when Infants, were after they come to Age truly converted? That that bleſſed work of Grace upon their Hearts was by virtue of their Infant-Baptiſm, or from any Motive that aroſe from thence? Or was it not wholly done by the Power of God's Word preached to them, through the mighty Power and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Holy Ghoſt upon their Souls? God hath ſhewed his Mercy, I grant, to ſuch Chriſtians who were Rantized or Sprinkled, in Infancy, in a gracious manner: But this is not to be aſcribed to his owning and bleſſing that Invention of <hi>Pedo-Baptiſm;</hi> be ſure God will never own as you well ſay, an Earthly Invention; and I have clearly proved that Infant-Baptiſm is nothing leſs or more than an Earthly or Human Invention, therefore God never bleſſed that. O how few are converted or truly regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that have in their Infancy been (as you ſay) baptized, nay of the Seed of the Faithful! What a Multitude re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ungodly, and ſo live and die, notwithſtanding their Parents Faith, and their Reception of their Infant-Baptiſm! The Lord open the Eyes of you <hi>Worthy and Noble Britains,</hi> and ſend true Light among you as to this matter.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Infant-Baptiſm prevents (Mr. <hi>Owea</hi> ſaith) the ſhameful Neglect of Baptiſm: if Children had been left unbaptized, it would be ſo difficult to perſuade many good People to receive Baptiſm, as at this Time 'tis to perſuade them to receive the Lord's Supper. The Nature of Man is very unwilling to undergo narrow and ſpiritual Obligation: We read in the Hiſtory of the Primitive Church that ſeveral good Men, that turned from <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> delayed their Baptiſm until their Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſtantine</hi> being very Aged before he was Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and fallen into a Diſeaſe of which he died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was not baptized until he was fallen ſick, as <hi>Socrates, p.</hi> 5. 6. And we are not to think (ſay you) that People would be more ready to receive Baptiſm in theſe Days, than they had been in thoſe that are paſt.</p>
            </q>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:65865:142"/>
1 <hi>Anſw.</hi> I Anſwer; it is a ſhameful thing indeed to ſee how many good People do neglect Chriſt's Holy Ordinance of Baptiſm; and to ſee how difficult 'tis to perſuade them, tho' they do truly believe, to be baptiſed, and ſo orderly come to the Lord's Table: But what is the reaſon of it? is it not becauſe you, and ſuch as you, have ſtrove to deceive them, and blind their Eyes, by telling them that Sprinkling or <hi>Rantiſm,</hi> is Baptiſm or Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, and that they were baptized in their Infancy? they are, alas, too ready to build their Faith herein upon their Teachers; <hi>The Teachers of my People</hi> (ſaith <hi>the Lord) cauſe them to err:</hi> And (ſay they) ſuch a learned Man, ſuch a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Doctor and Miniſter is for Infant-Baptiſm; Can they be miſtaken? Sure, if it were an Error, they muſt needs know it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis not very hard to perſuade our Children, when God converts them, to be baptized; they readily ſubmit to it; and, until then, they have no more right to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm than they have to the Lord's Supper.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Will you to anticipate your Children, in fear they will not be baptized when they come to Age, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Word of God, baptize them when in their Infancy? I muſt tell you by the ſame parity of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſince ſome of them you find are ſo hard to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to receive the Lord's Supper, you may (as the Antient Fathers did) give them the Lord's Supper in their Infancy alſo; you have as much Authority for to do the one as the other.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Do you not implicitly on this Occaſion grant and confeſs, that Baptiſm of Right belongs to the Adult; but that <hi>politically</hi> it hath been contrived to baptize Infants, for fear they ſhould not be perſuaded to be baptized when they come to Age? And you are willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Practice, becauſe it is in theſe Days by you and your Brethren rendered to be a very odious thing to be dipped or baptized when they come to Age and do believe. The Truth is, this Ordinance calls for great Abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and much Self-denial; 'tis a hard thing to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Baptiſmal Covenant and Obligation, in Adult Perſons,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65865:142"/>
when we are rendered as bad as <hi>Adulterers</hi> and <hi>Murderers</hi> who baptize Men and VVomen according to Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion that are Diſciples. And 'tis hard alſo when the baptized Perſon knows (he being come to Underſtanding) what he is bound and obliged to do by his Baptiſmal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>viz.</hi> to mortify the Remainders of Sin, and to walk in Newneſs of Life, <hi>Rom</hi> 6. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Therefore ſince you fear they will not freely and voluntarily liſt themſelves under Chriſt's Banner, or become his Spiritual Souldiers when they come to Age; you will, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to them, force them into theſe VVars in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy without Chriſt's Authority or their Conſent, under this ſpecious Pretence, <hi>viz.</hi> you fear they will not do it when they are grown up.</p>
            <p n="5">5. What you ſpeak concerning thoſe Chriſtians, who in the Primitive Times delayed their Baptiſm until the latter part of their Lives, makes directly againſt you; for thoſe Chriſtians who were converted from Paganiſm to Chriſtianity, did not only delay their Baptiſm, but many Godly Chriſtian Parents, I have ſhewed, in the laſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, did delay the baptizing of their Children until they came to Age and did believe: And the Error of that long Delay aroſe from that great Miſtake that Baptiſm waſhed away Sin; therefore ſome delayed Baptiſm until ſuch time they thought they were ready to go out of the World.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But what of this? Becauſe ſome have erred, in ſtaying too long before they were baptized, Will you make too great haſte, and bring in little Babes to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, without any Ground or Authority from the Word of God? So much ſhall ſuffice to your <hi>Twelfth</hi> and Laſt Argument.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, we have heard all your Proofs for the baptizing of Infants; you have, it ſeems, impannell'd for your <hi>Jury,</hi> to Sit, Hear and Determine this Grand Cauſe, <hi>Juſt Twelve;</hi> and if they could ſpeak, they would (being all agreed, the Cauſe being alſo fully opened) give their Verdict on our Side, and againſt your Infant-Baptiſm; but let them rather be ſo many Witneſſes of your ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the Statute Book, and great Charter of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> God's Word, having been opened, <note place="margin">☞</note> and the Matter cleared. We will appeal now to our worthy Reader, particularly to the <hi>Antient and Noble Britains,</hi> to make Judgment for themſelves: For in matters of Faith, and Things that concern our Souls, every Chriſtian is to judg for himſelf.</p>
            <p>Impartial Reader, weigh well the matter: Conſider this, we muſt all be judged by the VVord of God: If you can find you are commanded to baptize your Children by Jeſus Chriſt in the New Teſtament, or can find any Precept or Precedent for it, you may do it: Or if what Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> hath ſaid hath convinced you, that Baptiſm doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Believers, by good Authority he hath ſhewed from the Holy Scriptures, but that Infants are the only Subjects thereof; and that Baptiſm is nor dipping or burying the Body in VVater, but only ſprinkling or pouring a few Drops of VVater on the Perſon's Face; then continue in your former Practice till God ſhall open your Eyes. But if you are otherwiſe perſwaded, that Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> is in an Error, then I exhort you that believe in Chriſt, to ariſe and be baptized: But leſt Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſhould ſay 'tis too ſoon for you to make Judgment yet, pray ſtay till we have heard his Anſwers to our <hi>Objections,</hi> and alſo all what he hath further to ſay.</p>

               <q>Thus have we proved by the Scripture (ſaith he) and by ſeveral Scriptural Arguments, that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Faithful ought to be baptized: if we look upon this Truth in the Light of the Scriptures Above, the Objections of themſelves will vaniſh away; yet for the ſake of the Weak, I ſhall lay down the ſtrongeſt of them.</q>

            </p>
            <q>
               <p>There is not one particular Command, <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> naming Infant-Baptiſm, and that is not neceſſary; but there is an Univerſal Command to baptize all Nations, of which Children are a great part.</p>
               <p>If there is a Command for the baptizing of the Parents, then there is a Command for the baptizing
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:65865:144"/>
of Infants; for the Children are included in the Parents, even as Parts of them, being Partakers of the Privileges of good Parents, and of the Judgments of the wicked Parents.</p>
            </q>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, Whether you have or have not proved, by the Holy Scriptures and Arguments, that Infants ought to be baptized, is now upon a fair Trial committed to the Judgment of the Impartial Reader.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We do not require you to bring a Command, in <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> or in ſo many Words, Let Infants be baptized: But your Inferences are not good; for, as you have no Precept, no Command, or any Precedent to baptize them, ſo you can draw no fair and good Conſequences for it from any Text of Scripture.</p>
            <p>You bring the Words of the Great Commiſſion, Matth. 28. 19, 20. <hi>Go baptize all Nations.</hi> Sir, Why dare you leave out part of the Words? Is it not <hi>Go therefore, teach all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c.? We have ſhewed in our Anſwer to you already, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion requires none to be baptized but ſuch who are firſt taught or made Diſciples; which Diſciples St. <hi>Mark</hi> calls Believers, <hi>He that believes and is baptized,</hi> Mark 16. 16. They are, Reader, the Words of the ſame Commiſſion, tho differently expreſſed by theſe two <hi>Great Evangeliſts,</hi> and hold forth the ſame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Goſpel is to be preached in all Nations, or to all the World, and that thoſe that are diſcipled by preaching, or that do believe, ought to be baptized, and none elſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whereas you ſay that Children are a great part of the Nations, and may therefore be baptized; this is a fallacious or deceitful Conſequence: For may not I (as before) argue thus? Unbelievers, <hi>i. e. Turks, Infidels, Pagans</hi> and their Children, are a great part of all Nations, therefore may be baptized. Sir, I appeal to your Conſcience, Whether this Inference is not as good and true, from the Premiſes, as yours.</p>

3. But you ask whether there is a command for the baptizing of Parents, no doubt of this, we and you agree, that there is a command to baptize Parents, that believe in Chriſt, and to baptize Children too that believe in Chriſt;; but ſay you then, there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to baptize Infants, becauſe they are included in the Parents, even as parts of them; now this is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly falſe, and alſo very ridiculous, 'tis for any Man to aſſert it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For if this was ſo, it follows, whatſoever God commands the Parent, he commands the Child, then when God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer up, or ſlay his Son, he commanded the Son to ſlay himſelf; it would alſo follow, That</p>
            <p n="2">2. When God commands the believing Parent to partake of the Lord's Supper, he alſo commands all his Children to partake of the Lord's Supper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are all included in their Parents.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If Children are thus a part of their Parents, then certainly, if the Parents go to Heaven, all their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren muſt go to Heaven likewise; for the whole of Believers ſhall be ſaved, and not a part of them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, Reader obſerve, that here Mr. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> hath given away his cauſe for ever, for he ſaith Chriſt ſpeaks not of the Children of the Faithful, but of the Adult: Now conſider, that theſe two Texts which he here Quotes, <hi>viz. Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. does contain the great and only Commiſſion and Warranty given by the Lord Jeſus, the only Law-giver about Baptizing; and if Infants are not mentioned nor intended here, there is no Warrant at all to Baptize them; for if by virtue of the great Commiſſion, all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons muſt firſt believe before they are baptized, farewell for ever to Infant Baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Objection well ſaith, That according to this Rule or Commiſſion, the Apoſtles did not baptize any until they believed which is true and he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider that the Commiſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. did not only authorize the Apoſtles to go and make Diſciples among the Gentile or Pagan World, but alſo among the Jews, that were the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> nay they were commanded firſt to begin (or open their Commiſſion) to preach to them at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> moreover the words of this Commiſſion is all the Commiſſion and Warrant, the Diſciples and Miniſters of the Goſpel have to adminiſter Baptiſm to all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Nations to the end of the World. There are not two Commiſſions given by Chriſt about baptizing, one to go to the Pagan or Gentile World, and another to be believing Chriſtian World, or to believers and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:65865:147"/>
their Seed. Now there is but one Commiſſion, and only Rule we have to baptize, therefore Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith well, i. e. <hi>Chriſt in his Commiſſion directeth his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to make Diſciples, and then baptize them, promiſing,</hi> that he that believeth and is Baptized, ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Baxt.

And in another place, he ſaith, ſpeaking of this only Warrant or Commiſſion of Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, <hi>if we have it not here, where have we it.</hi> Shall any one think Chriſt's Commiſſion ſhort and defective.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith, if we were to preach unto ſuch that is to unbelievers or Heathens, we ſhould baptize none until they believed. Now pray conſider that this is his Commiſſion to baptize, if he be a true Miniſter of Chriſt, let him preach to whom he will, or come where he will, he muſt do all things according to this Commiſſion, as 'tis here given, neither baptize Young nor Old, neither Jew nor Gentile, Parent nor Child, until they believe, or profeſs their Faith in Jeſus Chriſt; if he doth, he Violates and acts directly contrary to his only Commiſſion, and therefore if he doth, he ſins, Should any <hi>Commiſſioner</hi> of an Earthly King, act contrary to the very expreſs words, and purport of his Commiſſion, he certainly would be condemned, as a falſe and unfaithful Servant, and be turned out of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Service. Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Seed of the faithful, Chriſt mentioneth not,</hi> that is in his great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. therefore ſuch he muſt not Baptize, unleſs he hath from Chriſt received a new, or any other Commiſſion that doth au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize him ſo to do.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And obſervable it is to ſee how Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> contradicts himſelf here, in reſpect of what he ſaid before, when he mention'd the ſame Texts and Commiſſion of Chriſt, he told us <hi>that Children are part of the Nations</hi> that Chriſt commanded to be Baptized, but now he ſaith, <hi>The Seed of the Faithful, Chriſt mentioneth not,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure now, at this turn he ſpeaks the Truth: and if none of the Seed of the Faithful ought to be Baptized by vertue of Chriſts Commiſſion, but ſuch only of them that do believe, then no Infant; for <hi>Teaching</hi> is making of Diſciples, ſo that they are to be taught ſo as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve before they are to be Baptized, and that in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whether <hi>Heathens</hi> or <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and that alſo to

            <p>
               <q>It is certain, ſaith Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> that this Scripture mentioneth not of Children, if it doth they muſt needs be damned, for want of Faith which cannot be actually in them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, 'tis very true, that Chriſt in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion neither meaneth nor mentioneth Infants; he hath given no Commiſſion to baptize Infants, becauſe the words of the Commiſſion runneth to ſuch who are capable to be taught, to be made <hi>Diſciples</hi> by <hi>Teaching</hi> and ſo <hi>to Believe,</hi> which Infants Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith, cannot actually do.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But he adds, the Apoſtle ſaith in 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 10. ſaith he, if any would not work, neither ſhould he eat would not that Father be unnatural, who would take an occaſion from this Scripture to ſtarve his little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, becauſe they cannot work; ſo when Chriſt ſaith, he that believeth and is baptized; it doth not follow, that none ought to be baptized untill they believe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1. I anſwer, this ſeems ſtrange, when Chriſt in the Affirmative declares, who he would have baptized; doth it not follow that in the Negative, none elſe ought to be baptized. In other caſes you would not argue thus, as for Example, when God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to Circumciſe his Male In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, doth he not implicitly forbid the Circumciſing of his <hi>Female Children,</hi> and when he commanded him to Circumciſe his Male Infants on the eighth day, doth he not implictly forbid him to circumciſe them on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth or ninth day, and when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>let a Man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine himſelf, and ſo let him eat,</hi> doth he not forbid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to partake thereof, and all to come to the Lord's Supper, that do not ſo examine themſelves, or who do not diſcern the Lord's Body. Moreover,</p>
            <p>2. Are not all thoſe Perſons that a teſtator in his laſt Will and Teſtament leaveth out, or expreſſeth not, excluded from having any Legacy in the ſaid Will; now the great Commiſſion, <hi>Mat. 28.

The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let a Man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat,</hi> &amp;c. but this ſay I, is ſpoken of the Adult; but Infants, who are capable to receive Spiritual Benefits by Chriſt's Death, muſt have the Ordinance that figureth it out, namely the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.

               <q>Infants do not underſtand what is done, and therefore what profiteth Baptiſm unto them; this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> anſwereth as followeth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Objection, ſaith he, is not only againſt Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, but againſt Circumciſion alſo; yet the Ordinance was profitable unto them. A little Child may receive a great gift, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer Circumciſion was God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, Infants had aright to it, but God has not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Infants to be Baptized, God's Ordinance ſhall have that effect on its proper ſubject, which he deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, no doubt had it been the Will of Chriſt to have given Command to Baptize Infants, but it ſhould ſome ways or another been profitable to them; but ſince he hath not Commanded it, it can no way profit them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A little Child may receive a great Gift no doubt, but they muſt not have that given to them, that God never appointed for them. When God gave out the Commiſſion of Circumciſion, he Commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> as an Adult Perſon to be Circumciſed; and alſo at the ſame time Commanded him to Circumciſe his Male
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65865:149"/>
Children; that was by a poſitive Law, a gift given to all the Male Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to all the Male Children by <hi>Iſaac</hi> in their Generation, whether their Parents were godly or wicked; but Baptiſm in Chriſts Commiſſion, is only given to Believers and to all that Believe, and therefore no Gift given to Infants, we muſt not be Wiſer then God, nor add to his word.</p>
            <q>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Obj.</hi> Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> adds another Objection againſt his Doctrine, <hi>viz. Chriſt was about Thirty years of Age when he was Baptized,</hi> Luke 3. 23. </p>
               <p n="1">1. His anſwer is, though he was not Baptized until he was Thirty years of Age, yet he was Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed when he was eight days Old, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He delayed not his Baptiſm, becauſe not fit to receive it, for he was perfectly Holy from the Womb, and therefore if we are bound to imitate his example in this thing, none of thoſe that do believe ought to be Baptized, until they be Thirty years of Age, but the Antipedobaptiſts walk not according to this Rule, and therefore they do think this example bindeth them not.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, no doubt, if any Babe was a fit Subject of Baptiſm, it was the Holy Child <hi>Jeſus,</hi> if pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and inherent Holineſs, gave to the Subjects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the proper right, but 'tis not Holineſs primarily and ſimply conſider'd in it ſelf, that gives any perſon a right to Baptiſm, but the meer poſitive Command of God, and the poſitive Command of God, only runs to ſuch Perſons that believe, and therefore not to Infants, tho' we grant the poſitive Command of Circumciſion, required Male Infants to be Circumciſed under the Law, which Law Chriſt came to fulfil, and obey in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, therefore Chriſt when an Infant was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed according to the Tenor of the Law, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereof; and he was Baptized also when an Adult Perſon, according to the Tenor and Rule of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: No doubt had it been the mind and will of God, That Infants ſhould have been Baptized, Jeſus Chriſt as an example to others would have been Baptized in his Infancy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <q>But ſay you, if we are to imitate our Saviour in his Baptiſm, we muſt not be baptized until we are Thirty years of age.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:65865:149"/>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This is an abſur'd and an idle Dream, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt by mentioning the time of Chriſts Age when he was Baptized, and that he was about Thirty years Old, holds forth no doubt not leſs then this, That all perſons ought to come to a <hi>mature age,</hi> or to ripeneſs of underſtanding, before, they be Baptized, for the <hi>Jews</hi> looked upon that Age to be a perfect and <hi>mature age.</hi> The Prieſts did not till about that Age enter into the exerciſe of their Office; and therefore in oppoſition to what you ſay the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> do walk according to Chriſts Rule, <hi>i.e.</hi> the example of Chriſt in the point and time of Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> That all perſons muſt delay their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, untill they come to ſuch ripeneſs of Age, as to be grown up to <hi>maturity</hi> ſo as to underſtand what baptiſm signifies, and to be capable to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, which ſome arrive unto ſooner then others; for ſome have the underſtanding of Men when very Young, may be, have more wiſdom at <hi>Twelve</hi> years of Age, then ſome others have at <hi>Thirty,</hi> but they that arrive not to underſtanding by the Thirtieth year of their Age cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly never will attain to the wiſdom and knowledge of Men of underſtanding.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Beſides 'tis evident, that our Saviour did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon his Miniſtry until he was baptized, to ſhew that no Goſpel Miniſter ſhould undertake to preach the Goſpel, or become a paſtor of a Church, that is, an unbaptized Perſon; and the Holy Ghoſt mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Age of our Saviour when he was baptized, doth no doubt ſhew us, that the proper Subjects of Baptiſm, are only adult Perſons, ſo far 'tis our rule as an Example.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But ſay you, many Actions of Chriſt are for our inſtruction, which are not to be imitated, and ſuch was his Baptiſm, when he was thirty Years of Age, he being willing to bear Witneſs to the Miniſtry of <hi>John,</hi> who began to baptize a little before, as his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of taking the Miniſtry upon him, when he was thirty years of Age, and not before, bindeth not all others to follow him, ſo is his Example of being baptized in the ſame Year, no rule to all others.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, though we grant that many Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſt are for our inſtruction, which are not
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65865:150"/>
to be imitated by us, yet we ſay in contradiction to you, in this we are ſo far to imitate him, as not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any to Baptiſm, until they come to a competent degree of underſtanding; for had not Chriſt deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo far as to leave us an Example in this matter, no doubt, his Age when baptized, had not been left upon Record; nay, and had Infants been the proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Goſpel Baptiſm, we may be ſure Chriſt (as I ſaid before) had been Baptized as well as he was Circumciſed, when an Infant; but he being God as well as Man, foreſeeing how this Ordinance in after times would be corrupted, and the proper ſubjects thereof changed, even from Believers, or adult Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to Infants, thought it neceſſary no doubt to leave upon record the very time of his Age, when bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, to all Generations, to put an end to this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.</p>
            <p>For this is ſaid, by the <hi>pedobaptiſts, viz.</hi> in the firſt age of the Church, or when baptiſm was firſt given forth Believers were Baptized, but where do you find, ſay they, that any Believer in all the New Teſtament that was baptized, did delay to Baptize his or her Child, untill they come to a ripe Age.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We anſwer,</hi> That we do find ſuch an Inſtance in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of our Saviours Baptiſm, for all muſt confeſs, that the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> or Mother of Jeſus, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> his ſuppoſed Father, were both eminent Believers, and Baptized too, (none doubt of that) and yet they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed or referred the Baptizing of the Holy <hi>Jeſus</hi> until he became an Adult Perſon.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But if any ſhould Object that</hi> John, <hi>who was the firſh that received a Commiſſion to Baptize, was but a little Older then our Saviour; and therefore was not capable to Baptize Jeſus Chriſt when he was a Babe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, tho' this be true, yet God being a <hi>free Agent,</hi> and not tyed to one Man more than to another, could not he have given Commiſſion to any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to have Baptized the Bleſſed Child Jeſus, or have ſent <hi>John</hi> ſooner into the World; what is his pleaſure to have done, he wanted not Inſtruments or Miniſters to do; therefore it follows plainly it was not his Pleaſure or Will, that Chriſt ſhould be Baptized, when an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant; to convince us that Infants are not the proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Goſpel Baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="4">

4. This ſhews alſo in oppoſition to what Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaid before that Baptiſm by Gods Command, was not in the Jewiſh Church before <hi>John</hi> received Commiſſion from Heaven to Baptize.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As to that you ſpeak, of Chriſts not entring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his Miniſtry till Thirty years of Age, that that is no example for others. I anſwer that he was oblidg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fulfill both the Precepts of the Law and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; and therefore in compliance to the Law, (that the <hi>Jews</hi> might not Quarrel with him) he entred not on his Miniſtry untill that time of his Age, which the Prieſts and Miniſters under the Law did, for he was made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, and was to be ſubject to all the Laws and precepts thereof; and in that he is, 'tis true, no example to Goſpel Miniſters, but Baptiſm being a pure Goſpel precept, in that he was by us to be Imitated ſo far, as we ought not to be Baptized, untill we become A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult Perſons, and do believe in him, he hath left us an Example how we ſhould follow his ſteps.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> brings in his <hi>Fifth Objection</hi> againſt his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and practice of Infant Baptiſm, <hi>viz. If Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm belongs to Infants, why do not you give them the Lords Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take his anſwer, <q>Becauſe, ſaith he, the Apoſtle Commands thoſe that receive the Lords Supper to examine themſelves, and to diſcern the Body of the Lord, which little Children cannot do.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer: And as the Apoſtle Commands all that receive the Lords Supper to examine themſelves, and to diſcern the Lords Body, ſo likewiſe <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> the Lord Jeſus and his Apoſtles too, Commanded all that received baptiſm to believe and repent, and to bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance, which little Babes cannot do. <hi>Repent and be Baptized every one of you,</hi> Acts 2. 37. <hi>If thou believeſt with all thy Heart thou mayeſt,</hi> Acts 8. 37. that is, be baptized.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <q>You ſay, Baptiſm is the Sacrament of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and of our Admiſſion into the Church of God; the Lord's Supper is a Sacrament of our Growth and Spiritual Food.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>I anſwer,</hi> this quite overthrows your Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, unleſs you <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> do believe as the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth, or at leaſtwiſe, what they affirm, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:65865:151"/>
that Baptiſm doth regenerate the Child, is Baptiſm an Ordinance or Sacrament of Regeneration, <hi>i. e.</hi> to regenerate Perſons, or to hold forth that regeneration, or the New Birth is wrought in ſuch that are baptized, why then do you baptize Infants, who are not the Subjects of Regeneration? Can they die to Sin, and are they raiſed up out of the Water new Born Creatures, to walk in newneſs of Life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If your Infants are new born, or born again by Baptiſm, no doubt the Food of the new Creature, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord's Supper ought to be given to them. The firſt Sacrament holds forth, 'tis clear, a Perſon born again, or a Babe of Grace; the other is Food, fit and proper for that New born or Regenerated Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that he may grow thereby, therefore they belong both to one and the ſame Subjects, and neither of them it appears from hence do belong to Infants, but</p>
            <p n="3">3. Are all the Infants that you baptize, let in as Members of your Church, are they abſolutely Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of your Congregations, as having the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Admiſſion, is the Door of God's Houſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to them? How can you then (ſay I) deny them the priviledge of true and lawful Members, ſhall your little Members, your Lambs in Chriſt's Fold being New Born be ſtarved, what ſhall the regenerated Babe not be fed with the Food of their Fathers Houſe?</p>
            <p n="4">4. But if thus, what number of Members have you in your Churches, that have not their Names in your <hi>Church-book,</hi> nor perhaps, never looked after when grown up, nor caſt out, though prophane and Wicked? for do you caſt out or exclude all ſuch Children you baptized, when grown up, if not, what polluted Churches are yours. Infant Baptiſm was doubtleſs contrived to encreaſe National Churches, or to make national Churches, and it doth tend indeed, to increaſe and continue that Chriſtian Religion that is in Name only, and not in Power; you have, its true in <hi>England,</hi> by meer neceſſity loſt your National Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and are become Congregational, whether you will or no, but Infant Baptiſm will not accord with a congregation Conſtitution, nor do ſuch Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65865:151"/>
ſo conſtituted that are for Infant Baptiſm, own their Babes to be proper and true Members of their Churches ſo far as I can learn, what then ſignifies your Sacrament of Admiſſion, if they are not in truth admitted and owned as Members, and allowed the Food and Priviledges of ſuch.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <q>You ſay it was formerly, though Circumciſion belonged to Infants, yet the Paſchal Lamb belonged not but to the Adult.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, this is denyed, prove if you can, that the little Children in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church were not admitted to eat of the Paſſover, it is poſitively ſaid, <hi>Exod. 12. 34. That the whole Houſe were to eat thereof, even a Lamb for an Houſe,</hi> and I find a great Writer aſſerting the ſame thing, that little Children did eat thereof, they were to bring their Children once or twice a Year before the Lord; and I ſee no ground you have to ſay that none but Adult Perſons did eat thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But let that be as it will, that which was or might be the right of <hi>Jewiſh Church-Members</hi> or not their right, is no rule for us in the Goſpel Church, as I have ſufficiently prov'd; and beſure all baptized Perſons who are regular Members of a Goſpel Church, cannot be denyed the Lord's Supper without Sin. So much to your Anſwers to our Objections, you might might have brought twice as many more.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>In Anſwer to Mr. <hi>James Owen's</hi> 17 Chapter, wherein the Antipedo Baptiſts are cleared of thoſe foul Charges he hath caſt upon them; and 'tis proved, that to deny Infant Baptiſm is no Sin, nor are thoſe guilty of Murther nor Adultery that baptize or dip Men and Women in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the Name of the Father, Son, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit; (as <hi>Mr. Owen</hi> charges them) but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe it is proved, that to Baptize or Rantize Infants, is an unlawful Practiſe and very Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <q>YOU ſay, you ſhall demonſtrate in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, how great the Sin is of thoſe that are tempted to deny the Baptiſm which they receive in their Infancy, and that ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be baptized again; there are many People that know not the nature of their firſt Baptiſm, and are perverted to renounce it, thinking that they do pleaſe God in ſo doing, but they fall into Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the Snares of the Devil, who is the Author of Errors and Father of falſhood.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I hope by this time, the Reader may diſcern how great an error 'tis to call Rantiſm or Sprinkling Baptizing, and that Infant Baptiſm is alſo an error, being a meer human innovation, this I have prov'd, and thereſore 'tis ſo far from being a Sin to diſown it and caſt it away, that it is every good Chriſtians Duty ſo to do, that would in all things walk by the rule of God's Word. And for Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> to charge our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple after this manner, as if we were perverted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared by the Devil, in denying our Infants Baptiſm, is juſt as the Papiſts uſed to charge the Proteſtants that diſowned the human Traditions, and the vain
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65865:152"/>
Fopperies of their rotten Church, and thunder'd out their Bulls againſt them.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <q>1 You ſay they are guilty of great Sin, inſomuch that they neglect to make a right uſe of their firſt Baptiſm, Infant Baptiſm putteth them under continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Vow to the Lord, and they are bound to renew their Vows, to take the Lord to be a God unto them, as ſoon as they come to age.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis true, you brought them under an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation or a Vow, to take the Lord to be their God in their Infancy, but why did you do it, unleſs you had any Warrant or Authority from God; for to do ſuch a thing in his Name without his Authority, is Sinful.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You might better have ſtayed till they came to Age of underſtanding, and if you would bring them under a Vow, have cauſed them then to have entered into a Covenant to take the Lord to be their God, and no doubt your Children might more dread to break ſuch a Vow they conſented to and freely made, then a Covenant or Vow you cauſed them to enter into in their Infancy, to which they never conſented; but perhaps you will ſay, you have no Ground nor Authority from Gods word to do that, as much eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way as you have in Infancy to baptize them, which we ſay is no Baptiſm at all, much leſs Chriſt's true Baptiſm, therefore God thereby oblieged them not to do what you ſpeak, but it is their Duty when grown up, if God gives them Faith to caſt it away as an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Tradition, and to enter into God's Holy Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Covenant as Believers, according to Chriſt's great Commiſſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Chriſts Baptiſm, or the Baptiſm of Believers was not ordained to oblige Perſons who are in their natural State (whether young or old) to be come the Lord, or to be regenerated, or to die to Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but as being his, or regenerated before baptized, their baptiſmal Covenant obligeth them to walk as the Lord's People in newneſs of Life; ſo that it appears, that Infants baptiſmal Covenant, is directly repugnant in the end and deſign of Chriſt's true Baptiſmal Covenant, (as I have more fully e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

No Sir, we have ground to hope our Children that Die are as happy as yours, tho' never Baptiſed; and that from Gods word. Hath not Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Of ſuch are the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> no doubt God hath comprehended Infants in his eternal electing Love that Die, for whom he alſo gave his Son, and in ſome ſecret way doth Sanctifie them, or makes them meet for glory above; and we have as much ground to hope, that God will give Grace to thoſe Children of ours that live, as you have to hope he will give Grace to yours.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was not for the ſin or demerits of Infants that God hath not received them as Members of the Goſpel Church, only it was his own Sovereign Will and Pleaſure not ſo to do, nor can you prove that this is any ſpiritual loſs unto our Infants.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

Alſo, why ſhould not our Children have the promiſe of an <hi>External Canaan,</hi> as the <hi>Jewiſh Children</hi> had under the Law, what have they done to procure this loſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We do not deny Infants the ſame priviledges and place in the Covenant of Grace, which they ever had, no God forbid; our Children have every way (no doubt) like place in that Covenant which the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the faithful had under the Law, even them and all them of our Children, that have the ſaving bleſſings of Chriſt Merits, and of the ſaid unchangeable and eternal Covenant, but we ſay they are not in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of <hi>peculiarity</hi> God made with <hi>Abrahams</hi> Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Seed as ſuch; and ſo partake not of the external Rites and Priviledges of the Goſpel Church, or New Creation, until they do believe or are called by the Lord according to that promiſe you cite, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39.</p>
            <p n="4">4. What a noiſe do you make about your Infants great loſs by our Opinion; alas you cannot prove or make it appear they have any real Spiritual loſs, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, our Children have the ſame ſpiritual bleſſings now as ever, and God is as much the God of our Seed in a ſpiritual ſenſe, as ever he was to the Seed of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; all that we ſay is this, that our Infants have no

Is there no hope therefore left us of the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our dying Infants? what is it to give our Infants as ſuch, the ſign, who have not the thing ſignified thereby, you would have them have the <hi>Shell</hi> that have not the <hi>Kernel,</hi> and becauſe we will not give them the one, till God gives them the other, we are cenſured as uncharitable, What good did <hi>Simon magus</hi> his Baptiſm do him? Will Baptiſm ſave your Infants? and if all the Seed of the Faithful are (as you ſay) in the Covenant of Grace, they are ſafe enough whether they are baptized or not, we cannot bring them into that Covenant, nor caſt them out of it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And now Sir, pray do you attempt for once to do more then all your brethren have done before you, <hi>viz.</hi> prove what Spiritual or Temporal benefits your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren do receive by their pretended Baptiſm, Mr. <hi>Burkitt</hi> made aſſay to do this, but he is anſwered, and ſays no more, and I purpoſe for the ſake of the <hi>Ancient Britains,</hi> for whom I have always had great love, and an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable eſteem of, to take a little pains to tranſcribe Mr. <hi>Burkitts</hi> arguments in this reſpect, and my anſwers by and by.</p>
            <p n="6">6. 'Tis evident that baptiſm doth not infuſe Grace into them, nor the habits thereof, it does not change their Hearts; it doth not take away Original Sin. God can do it, 'tis true, nay, and God doth no doubt, change the Hearts of ſuch dying Infants that are ſaved; but prove if you can, their baptiſm doth this, and then. 2. what external priviledges of the Church do your Infants (as ſuch) receive, that are as, you ſay, baptized, you will not own them for <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Siſters,</hi> until they are Converted, you will not give them the Lords Supper until they are converted, they are not by the Lord's appointment brought under any Obligation by being baptized; and then as few of your Children, 'tis plain, become godly as of ours, pray ſhew us when you write again, what bleſſings or priviledges your Infants do receive by their <hi>Rantiſm,</hi> or <hi>Baptiſm</hi> as you call it?

            <p n="4">4.

            <p n="5">5. I do affirm that, that one Baptiſm that Unites to the Viſible Church (not to the Univerſal Church) is the Baptiſm of Believers, and not that of Infants; And to prove it, take this argument. <hi>If that Baptiſm the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles adminiſtred, and on which they received all Perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Viſible Church, was the Baptiſm of the Adult, or that of Believers only; then the baptiſm of the Adult, or that of Believers only, is that one and firſt Baptiſm; but the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm which the Apoſtles adminiſtred, and on which they received all Perſons into the Viſible Church, was the baptiſm of the Adult, or that of Believers only.</hi> Ergo, The Baptiſm of the Adult, or that of Believers, is that one or only Baptiſm of Chriſts Visible Church; for thoſe Members of the viſible Church in the Primitive times, that were wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in Baptiſmal Water, profeſſed themſelves waſhed alſo in Chriſts Blood, and they that were ſincere had the thing ſignified, as well as the Sign when they were baptized, but Infants never made any ſuch profeſſion, therefore Infant Baptiſm was not the firſt and one Baptiſm that Chriſt left in his Church.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is true that thoſe that deny Infant baptiſm, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Communion of the National Church, of which perhaps they were once Members, but this is not to make a diviſion in the Miſtical Body of Chriſt; nor in a true Conſtituted Goſpel Church. 'Tis a duty to come out from every falſe Church, <hi>Come out of her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="7">7. If baptiſm be that Ordinance that Unites us into the true Viſible Church, and Chriſts baptiſm be that of Believers, then Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> in denying of believers baptiſm, (which I have proved is that one baptiſm) is as much guilty of Sin in hindring that Union (by obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting as much as in him lieth, Believers to be baptized, and ſo Unite them to the ſaid true Viſible Church of

            <p n="8">8. From hence alſo it appears that our ſeparation from thoſe Churches that are Conſtituted upon Infant Baptiſm, do but divide from ſuch Churches that are not orderly gathered or Conſtituted according to the rule of the Goſpel and Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore no ſin ſo to do.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Nay, and evident it is that the greateſt Body of Mr. <hi>Owens Univerſal Catholick Church, is Antichriſtian:</hi> For I think none queſtion but the <hi>Popiſh Church,</hi> which is founded on Infant baptiſm, is for Number more then the <hi>Proteſtant Churches;</hi> however the <hi>Roman Church</hi> muſt be by what he intimates one great part of the Catholick Church, or <hi>Church of the living God.</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>is where there is a poſſibility, the ſafeſt way is to be choſen,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Where there is no poſſibility, the next, to the ſafeſt way is to be made uſe of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>When Impoſſibility ceaſes, every thing is to be ſupplied, which Impoſſibility would not admit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe Maxims are ſo agreeable to reaſon,</hi> (ſaith the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Dr.</hi> Du Veil) <hi>whoever intends to follow, will never queſtion, but that they ought to be baptized, if they have not received that baptiſm Ordained by Chriſt, but only Rhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm that is, the Sprinkling ſubſtitued</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in its room by a vulgar uſe, or rather abuſe,</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> calls it. <hi>thus</hi> Dr. <hi>Duveil in Hiſtorical expoſt, of Acts.</hi> cap. 2. page 86.</p>
            <p>That famous Divine <hi>John Forbes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Nor is it to be doubted but that they again ought to be baptized, who before have only received a Vain Waſhing, and not the true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſm: And though it be not ſo great as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts imagine, yet the neceſſity of this Sacament is very great, and the profit and advantage very conſiderable.</hi> See Dr. <hi>du Veil</hi> Act. 2. page 87.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever ſavours contrary to Truth is hereſy though it be an Ancient Cuſtom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the Learned, though they own not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptization, where baptiſm at firſt was duly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, yet ſuch who at firſt received only a pretended baptiſm, ought to be truly baptized; to baptize a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again, is ſinful and very unlawful thing, but ſince yours is no <hi>Baptiſm</hi> but only <hi>Rhantiſm,</hi> our practice is no
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:65865:161"/>
rebaptization, for as you do not the Act, ſo 'tis not done on the proper ſubject.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <q>7. They are guilty, ſay you, (that is; ſuch as deny Infant Baptiſm) of a great ſin, by giving offence to many that were baptized in their Infancy, tempting them to think that they are not under any vows unto God, and that their baptiſm bindeth them not to a new course of Life, if People judge themſelves free from their baptiſmal Obligation. O! How naked come they to Satans Temptations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, if you take an offence at us, becauſe we caſt away an humane Tradition, we cannot help that, ought we to obey Man rather then God, Judge ye.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis the force of Scripture arguments, or the power of Gods Word, that provoked us, and many Thouſands more to throw off the Innovation and ſinful practice of Infant Baptiſm; and dare you ſay it was Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan that tempted us, no I fear 'tis Satan or worldly profit, or to free themſelves from reproach, that tempts ſome of the <hi>pedobaptiſts</hi> to continue the practice of that deviſed Cuſtom. 'Tis not Satans uſe, nor intereſt to tempt Men to own Chriſts bleſſed Inſtitutions, and caſt off Mens Inventions, but endeavour to keep them Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the firſt, and to hold up the ſecond, which was let in us in the time of the <hi>Apoſtacy of the Church,</hi> which 'tis evident is a Pillar to uphold National Churches, and not only Popiſh, but ſome Proteſtant Conſtitutions also.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We are not tempted by Satan, but perſwaded by the Lord, and through the Power and Authority of his Word, to believe that God brought us not under that Vow or Obligation in Infancy, tho' you 'tis true do it, and ſo do the Papiſts, bring People under Vows and Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to live a ſingle Life, and do other things, all tending to Piety and Holyneſs, (as they tell you,) but God never brought them under any ſuch Vows or Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</p>
            <p>And tho' an human Obligation may have ſome force on the Conſcience, eſpecially when People think 'tis Gods Covenant, yet ought not the blind People among the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> to be told that thoſe Covenants are Human, and not Covenants God brought them under? Hath not
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:65865:162"/>
God ways enough, and ſuch that are ſufficient to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blidge our Children to die to Sin, and live a new Life? but doth he need Man's Supplements, ſhall man teach God? and will you Father your Baptiſmal Obligation on God, as that which he requires Infants to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der without the leaſt Shaddow of proof from his bleſſed Word. I muſt tell you all <hi>voluntary</hi> Vows are by Chriſt in the times of the Goſpel forbid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 33, 34. You ought not to bring your ſelves nor Children under any ſuch <hi>voluntary</hi> and <hi>promiſory</hi> Oaths, Vows, or Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; you muſt ſee you are Commanded to do it, or have clear Authority from the Lord to do this thing before you do it. God doth require Believers and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren when they believe, to come under a baptiſmal Vow or Obligation, but not till then.</p>
            <p>But do not think the purport of our Doctrine herein, is to open a Door for young People to Sin, God forbid; the Obligations which God in his Word, and godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and Miniſters by the authority of God's Word lay upon them are ſufficient, when the Lord works with them to oblige them to repent, believe, and lead a new Life, without your volunrary and unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Obligation laid upon them in Infancy, that you have no ground to believe God will ever bleſs, to the end you deſign it, unleſs he had commanded it; <hi>will you do Evil that Good may come on it.</hi>

Are there no Cloaths to be had, or no modeſt Garments for Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to be provided to cover all their nakedneſs, even Hands and Feet alſo if it be needful? ſure Sir, you muſt ſuppoſe ſomewhat of this kind, or there is no room left for you to caſt contempt and reproach upon the Ordinance it ſelf, but to blame the people they do not provide convenient Garments on purpoſe, that ſo they may not <hi>commit Adultery</hi> when they come to be Baptized.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Sir had you ſeen our People baptized you, had not been guilty of bearing falſe witneſs the Second time. <hi>Reader</hi> pray take notice that we provide comely Cloaths for the Adminiſter, both from Head to Foot; and our Men alſo that are baptized have Cloaths provided for them; and for the Women, Gowns and Petty-coats are made on purpoſe, and they go into the water dreſt more decently <hi>perhaps,</hi> then many Women come into Chriſtian aſſemblies; therefore this is a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Charge Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> caſts upon us, tho' he doth but follow the ſteps of Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> but 'tis worſe in him at this time of the Day, then in them then, becauſe our uſe and practice here, is now more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known: And theſe things being ſo, how can we in Dipping or Baptizing of Women be guilty of <hi>Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> or any of the Spectators?</p>
            <p>Can't you take a Woman dreſſed in modeſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Cloaths by the Hand, without having an unclean thought in your Heart? you may as well charge ſome Tradeſmen in the Exerciſe of their Trades with Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; indeed did we as Mr. <hi>B.</hi>—once falſly ſaid, baptize Women naked, or as you ſay,<q> near or half na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked (which are both notorious untruths) there might have been ſome colour for what you ſay; but if there be need to Dip the whole Body (ſay you) as they ſay there is, what rule have they in the Scripture to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize the Cloaths with the Body, the few Cloaths they have about them are dipped before the Body is dipped.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſw.</hi> All Men may perceive of what a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, contradicting quarelſome Spirit you are of, one while you ſtrive to expoſe Chriſt's Sacred Ordinance

to reproach, and us with it, as if we baptized Perſons naked, and then preſently ſeem to allow that we do not ſo, but that they whom we baptize have Cloaths on, but now the Cloaths are baptized, and then ask what Scripture we have for this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis enough Chriſt Commanded Dipping in his Name, and we are required to <hi>do all things decently.</hi> 'Tis no matter, ſo that the Body is buried in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 'tis not the Cloaths that we ſay we baptize, but the Perſon. Chriſts Ordinance of Baptiſm in one eſſential part lies in the words of Adminiſtration, Do you never Sprinkle ſome drops of Water on the Childs <hi>Fine dreſſes,</hi> if you ſhould, what doth that ſignifie? you have wrote <hi>hard words,</hi> and Chriſt is coming to convince <hi>all of their ungodly deeds, and of all their hard Speeches ſpoken againſt him,</hi> Jude 15. I pray God this Sin be not laid to your <hi>Charge.</hi> Thus I have been helped to take off that reproach and vile ſlanders caſt upon the baptizing Believers, and have proved it is not re-baptization; therefore let Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> caſt of his ſlanderous clamarous Pen, and <hi>Infants Rhantiſm,</hi> and repent and return to the Baptiſm, which Chriſt Inſtituted, and left in his Church to the end of the World; and now to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the evil and ſinfulneſs of Infant Baptiſm, take what follows, which I have tranſcribed out of my anſwer to Mr. <hi>Burkitt</hi>'s Book that he wrote for the Baptizing of Children two or three years ſince.</p>

               <p>Shewing that there is no Bleſſing to be expected in Baptizing Infants, but rather the diſpleaſure of the Jealous God, demonſtrating contrarywiſe to what Mr. <hi>James</hi> Owen <hi>hath ſaid (alſo Mr. Burkit</hi> and Mr. <hi>Daniel Williams,</hi> and all other pedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,) that it is avery ſinful and an unlawful practice.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>AS Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> hath laboured in vain to ſhew the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Infant Baptiſm, ſo Mr. <hi>Burkit</hi> a <hi>Learned Miniſter</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who in his late Treatiſe for Infant Baptiſm alſo did, ſee <hi>page</hi> 35, 36, 37, 38. of his Book.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>Burkitt</hi> ſaith <hi>Children are hereby Intereſted in all the prayers of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you pray for them as Members of the viſible Church, what ground have you ſo to do from Gods word, ſince God in the Goſpel times had not made them Members thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Can't we pray for our Children, tho' as yet they are not Members, that they may become Members thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He ſaith, <hi>by vertue of this admiſſion, they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the ſpecial providence of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No doubt but God doth exerciſe his ſpecial Care and Providence over all Elect Infants, but not the more for your baptizing them without his authority, or Command, much leſs Infants of Believers as ſuch.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He ſays, <hi>Hereby the Church ſtands nearer to them then to the reſt of mankind,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>mentioning that Text,</hi> Ifa. 54. 13. <hi>Thy Children ſhall be all taught of God.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Neither you nor Mr. <hi>Burkitt</hi> nor any pedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts in the World can bring Infants nearer to God, nor his Church by any act done by you without any rule left by Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Does that Text, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 13. refer to Infants of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:65865:166"/>
Believers as ſuch, or to thoſe godly and new re-born Children, who being born in sin, are indeed her Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Children.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He ſaith, <hi>Irfant Baptiſm, is an act of Dedication,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Who commanded you this way to Dedicate your Children to the Lord? Will you Teach the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, or are you wiſer than he? Doth he in his word require you ſo to do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. May not the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay as well, that thoſe Perſons they bring under their voluntary Vows, are thereby De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated unto God?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Mr. <hi>Burkitt</hi> ſaith, <hi>'Tis great advantage to Infants, as 'tis an Act of reſtipulation, that is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a Child at baptiſm enters into Covenant with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, Poor Babes, 'tis without their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and conſent, or God's appointment, which is worſt of all, or they being able to perform it then, nor many of them ever after, God never giving them his Grace ſo to do. But wo to them if they do not perform this Covenant, if Mr. <hi>Burkitt</hi> and Mr. <hi>Daniel Williams</hi> ſay true; he <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Daniel Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> in his Book called the vanity of youth. <hi>page</hi> 131.</note> ſays in his Catechiſm as followeth, That thoſe Children who perform not their Baptiſmal Covenant do.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They reject Chriſt. 2d. They renounce the Bleſſings of the Goſpel. 3dly. that 'tis Rebellion againſt their Maker. 4thly. That 'tis ingratitude and perjury againſt their Redeemer. 5thly. Groſs injuſtice to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. 6thly. That 'tis ſelf-killing Cruelty to their own Souls. 7thly. 'Tis (he ſaith) a damning Sin, nay its the heart of all Sin.</p>
            <p>Is this indeed the love you Pedo-baptiſts have to your poor Infants. What bring them into ſuch a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, without their knowledge and conſent, or God's appointment, and then threaten them if they break it, with Hell and Damnation, and what not?</p>
            <p>Do you know they are all Elect Perſons, and ſo ſuch that God will in time call, give grace to, and ſo change their evil and depraved Natures? if not, do you not heap up a multitude of evils upon them, and hereby make their condition worſe, or aggravate their Sin and miſery for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:65865:166"/>
I know not whether you be of this Pedo-baptiſts mind, or not, but I think <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> Worthy of blame as well as Mr. <hi>Burkit.</hi>
               </note> this Doctrine does not fit a Chriſtian Catechiſm? If God had required In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to enter into ſuch Covenant, ſome reaſon he might have thus to ſpeak; But ſince neither he nor you can prove it; This to me ſeems a daring boldneſs in a Miniſter of the Goſpel to aſſert, (who I hope is a good Man) God (I grant) expects, that all true believers ſhould perform their Baptiſmal Covenant, but then know, they are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of God actually to enter into it, &amp; they freely of their own choice enter into it; alſo they are ſuch God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven habitual Grace to perform it; And he hath promiſed them alſo a farther ſupply of Grace to enable them ſo to do; but nothing of this you can prove in Infants Covenanting in their Baptiſm, (but more of this by and by) nor will their Sureties help the matter; for if they cannot perform thoſe things they promiſe for themſelves, how ſhould they be able to do it for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? beſides 'tis an humane Invention, and not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God.</p>
            <p>But truly Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s Doctrine afflicts my Mind: Strange! is this Sin the damning Sin? I thought the damning Sin (by way of eminency) had been the Sin of unbelief. Suppoſe your own Child ſhould not believe, he is bound by vertue of that Baptiſmal Covenant you brought him into, but when grown up, diſowns that (you call) Baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for his not believing 'tis a Truth of Chriſt, muſt he be damned?</p>
            <p>But to proceed;</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Burkitt</hi> having ſhewed the advantages of Infant Baptiſm, without giving one Scripture Text to prove what he ſays is true; he in <hi>Page</hi> 38. comes to ſhew, that Baptiſm is more uſeful and beneficial to a Child in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, then to omit it till riper Age; becauſe no Infant Memberſhip is capable of Hypocriſy, which Perſons grown up are.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then give them the Lords Supper alſo, for doubtleſs if they receive it, they will not eat and drink their own damnation, as may be ſome that have it given to them, do. I tremble at what you dare to ſay and write, in which you ſeem to arraign the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:65865:167"/>
of the ever bleſſed Jeſus who he hath appointed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers or Adult perſons, who are gracious to be Baptized, and none elſe; and do you ſay, the Ordinance better ſuites with the Ignorant Babes? ſhould you dictate to your Earthly Prince, would he allow it? much leſs to contradict or Correct him, as if your Wiſdom were more then his.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>Burkitt</hi> ſayth, 'tis more advantageous to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, than thoſe of riper years; as it is a pre-engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them to reſiſt Temptations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He may after this rate bring them under an hundred Engagements and Covenants, which may be more plauſible ones too: may you not when they know what they do, make them take a Solemn Oath? or enter into Bonds upon pain of ſevere Puniſhment, that they ſhall not yield to Temptations, and pretend 'tis God's Law they ſhould do ſo, which if you can deceive their Judgments, they will dread as much, (nay it may be more) the breaking thoſe Oaths and Covenants, then this you bring them into, without any authority from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Mr. <hi>Burkitt</hi> ſaith, Baptiſm in Infancy is more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous then at riper years, as it is an early remedy againſt the malady of Original ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Speak, Doth Baptiſm take away Original ſin, or free them from that Malady or not? you know ſome of the Antient Fathers were carryed away with ſuch a dream; how comes it to paſs then, that this contagion appears ſo ſoon, and to be as ſtrong in your Children as in ours, who never were Baptized at all? But does not St. <hi>Peter</hi> tell you (1. <hi>Pet. 3. 20.) Baptiſm waſhes not away the filth of the Fleſh;</hi> Or is not Original Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution a filth of the Fleſh? What ſtuff is this you would force upon us and the World? we affirm Infants are no more capable of this Ordinance then any other. Why do you ſay of no Right but this? we challenge all the World by God's Word, to prove that they are capable of Baptiſm, any more then of the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He ſays Baptiſm Adminiſtred to Infants has this advantage, it puts the Chriſtian upon more bitter mourning for actual Sin, from that conſideration of that ſhameful Perjury and wilful Apoſtacy that is found in ſuch Perſons ſins.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:65865:167"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He is I find one of Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iams</hi>'s Brethren, <hi>i. e.</hi> he is of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief <note place="margin">The danger of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Baptiſmal Covenant layd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</note> it ſeems, but tremble at the thoughts of the Conſequences of your Doctrine. Have not your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren whengrown up, enough ſins to mourn for and bewail before the Almighty God, but you muſt bring them into a Covenant which you know they would break when they come to riper Age? and ſuch is the pravity of Human Nature, that there is no avoiding of it without a ſupernatural work of Grace; their Burden is heavy enough, you need not add to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is it not ſad, that Men ſhould give cauſe to their Children to think they are guilty of Perjury? when in truth they never were, nor of Apoſtacy from God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account. Our firſt Apoſtacy was bad enough, you need not go about to make them guilty of another. Alas! their pretended baptiſm never brought them one ſtep nearer to God, then thoſe Children are, who were never Baptized in their Infancy at all, where then is the Apoſtacy he ſpeaks of.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You hereby bring them under neceſſity of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Sin of Perjury, and of Apoſtacy, at leaſtwiſe in your own conceit, and in others too, if they can believe what this Man ſays, and ſo to cauſe them to mourn for that, or thoſe ſins moſt, which may be (if all things were rightly con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>'d) are no ſins at all. I do not mean that any of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> actual tranſgreſſions may not be ſin; but that they are not guilty of Perjury and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, by breaking that you call their Baptiſmal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: For if God brought them not into that Covenant, nor into any Covenant relation with himſelf thereby, I cannot ſee how there ſhould be ſuch a sting in the Tayl of it, as he affirms, and indeed, had they themſelves, of their own accord and conſent, entered into an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful or an unwarrantable Covenant which they were no ways able to perform, it may be doubted whether it would be Perjury in them if they kept it not, beſides, I hope they have not forſworn themſelves, how then is it Perjury?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Moreover, I deſire all thoſe Parents who baptize their Children, and you alſo, to conſider in the fear of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:65865:168"/>
God, the natural tendency and Conſequences of your bringing poor Babes into ſuch a Covenant.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That you force them to enter into this Covenant without any Authority or Command from God; for I challenge you and all pedobaptiſts in the World to prove God hath any where directly or indirectly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired any ſuch thing at your Hands.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider that 'tis not only a reformation of Life, or a bare refraining from the groſs acts of ſin, that you aſſert, is comprehended in this Baptiſmal Covenant, you cauſe Infants to enter into; but it is Regeneration it ſelf, <hi>i. e.</hi> a change of Heart, and ſavingly to believe in Chriſt; this you oblige your poor Babes to perform. Now what Arminianiſm is here fomented, if once you ſay or think, they are capable to perform this Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? but if they do not do it, wo be to them.</p>
            <p>Moreover what guilt do thoſe of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> bring their poor Sureties under, unleſs they stand obliged no longer then the Child abides in Infancy; and if ſo, what need of their Obligation at all, if they intend no more.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider, you brought them into this Covenant without their knowledge and conſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. Conſider, that whatſoever you think, that ſuch is the pravity of their natures, by means of our firſt Apoſtacy from God, or Original <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>As to the Adult.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider as I ſaid before,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all Believers, God himſelf doth require or Command in his Word to enter into this Baptiſmal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:65865:168"/>
2. And they before they enter into it, have a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of divine life infuſed into their Soul, or Grace implanted in their Hearts, having paſſed under the work of Regeneration, being dead to Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> (of which Baptiſm is a lively Symboll) or is as your Church ſays, an outward ſign of an inward ſpiritual Grace. Not as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> obſerves, a Sign or Simbol of future, but of preſent Regeneration, which is confirmed by what St. <hi>Paul</hi> Teaches, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How ſhall we that are dead to ſin live any longer therein? not may be dead, but are dead, and ſo Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Chriſt in Baptiſm, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. 4. If you ſay all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult Perſons Baptized are not Converted, I anſwer, they appear ſo to be, and as ſuch voluntarily enter into this Covenant: Beſides God does not require them without Faith to do it. Baptiſm doth not only repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Death and Burial of Chriſt, but alſo ſignifies our Death to Sin, or that Bleſſed work of Mortification or the remainder of the Body of Sin and Death, by which means Believers who enter into this Baptiſmal Covenant are putinto a Gracious and Meet Capacity to perform that Sacred Obligation; but ſo are not Infants.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That every true believer baptized, conſiders, pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders upon, and weighs with all ſeriouſneſs and delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Imaginable, the nature of this Covenant before he Signs it. And</p>
            <p n="4">4. That he doth it freely and voluntarily, and with his full liking, approbation and Conſent, neither of which do, nor can do thoſe poor Infants you force to enter into this Covenant. Theſe things conſider'd, it appears, as it is a ſinful Act in you to bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Covenant (ſince 'tis done without Command or Authority from God) ſo 'tis cruelty alſo towards your own Babes, by making them to become guilty of Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and thereby damning (as Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſays) their own Souls.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Conſider every true Believer that is liſted under Chriſt's Banner, by entring into this Baptiſmal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is by Chriſt compleatly armed, <hi>i. e.</hi> he hath the Chriſtian Armour put upon him, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. He hath the Breſt-plate of Righteouſneſs, the Shield of Faith, and for a Helmet, the hope of Salvation; and the Word of God, like a Sword in his Hand, to cut down all his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:65865:169"/>
Thus by the help of theſe Sacred Graces of the Spirit, he is enabled to fight againſt Sin, the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil. But alas! you liſt your poor Babes into this War, and make them Covenant and Vow to forſake the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World, and all the ſinful luſts of the Fleſh, but Arm them not. Did Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm confer Grace and Arm their Souls, it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but who dares aſſert that? Or if he does, who will or can believe him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. God hath alſo promiſed to aſſiſt, ſtand by, help and enable all Believers Baptized, with farther ſupplies of Grace, nay, they being actually United to Chriſt, have his bleſſed influencies flowing to them, beſides the promiſes of God, the Death, Reſurrection and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Chriſt, and the everlaſting Covenant of Grace, which is ordered in all things, and ſure, firmly ſecures all their Souls. But thus it is not with thoſe poor Babes you bring into this Covenant: You are like <hi>Pharoabs</hi> Task-maſters, <hi>Command the making Bricks, but allow them no Straw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Again conſider, how hereby great part of the Nations are perjur'd. I will appeal to the Conſciences of all thinking and underſtanding People, whether ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your principle and practice, it is not ſo. Mourn O <hi>England</hi> and lament, ſad is thy Caſe? If theſe Men ſpeak right or truly, what a multitude in thee have been made to enter into this Covenant, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver performed it. O Perjur'd Nation, Perjur'd People, and Perjur'd Paſtors, for ſo are all thy Debauched, Drunken, Swearing and unclean Teachers, are not theſe Perjur'd alſo? Have they kept their Vow and Covenant? Alas! inſtead of Mourning for this Sin, we may conclude they never thought of it. But let them break off their ſins by Righteouſneſs, I mean repent, and leave thoſe groſs acts of Wickedneſs, of which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, both Prieſts and People are guilty, and get renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace, and never let them fear this new deviſed ſin of Perjury: For if God's Word convinces of all Sins, and doth not convince of this ſort of Perjury, this is no Perjury; (I mean the ſimple breaking of that Covenant) tho' thoſe ſins by which they are ſaid to break it, are horrid Treaſon and Rebellion againſt the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:65865:169"/>
and provoke him to wrath every day. But God's word doth convince of all Sin, but doth not convince of this ſort of Perjury, as is affirmed. 'Tis not this which is the Self killing Murther, the damnable Sin; No no, but 'tis their unbelief, and contempt of God's Grace, or neglecting the great Salvation offer'd unto us by Chriſt in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Baptiſm adminiſtred in Infancy, hath, ſaith Mr. <hi>Burkitt,</hi> this ſingular advantage above that which is adminiſtred at riper Age, in that it gives the pious Parent a good Ground and Hope that his Children dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Infancy, are certainly ſaved, it makes (ſay you) that Ordinance a Channel of Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is like to the reſt. But Sir, by what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority do you aſſert all theſe things? You know what wonderful Vertue the Papiſts ſay, is in many of their Popiſh Rites, Ceremonies and Reliques, <hi>i. e.</hi> in their croſſing of themſelves, and in their Holy-water, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in their <hi>Agnns Dei.</hi> But how do they prove it? Even as well as you do, what you ſpeak here upon this account, and we have the ſame reaſon to believe them, as to believe you in what you ſpeak, without Proof or Authority from God's word.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Pious Parents! But alas, how few are there of that ſort? but what hope have the Impious, Prophane, and ungodly Parent of the Salvation of his dying Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? But Sir, I thought all the Pious and Believing or Godly Parents Children, were born in Covenant with God, that their Parents Faith would have ſecured them, whether Baptized or not, were not the <hi>Jews</hi> Female Children ſaved? they were not Circumciſed; And were not their Male Infants ſaved, who dyed before the Eighth Day?</p>
            <p n="3">3. From what Scripture is it, theſe Pious, though Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and deceiv'd Parents, may have hope that their Children that dye in their Infancy ſhall be ſaved, and none but theirs that are Baptized, or rather Ranti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Will Pedo-Baptiſts make Baptiſm their Saviour? Can Baptiſm ſave them, And is it ſo indeed? Is it in the power of Parents to ſave or damn their Children? And how came Baptiſm to have ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in it? or who made that a Channel of Grace to
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:65865:170"/>
dying Infants? Do you not place that Virtue in an external Rite, that only belongs to the Blood of Chriſt, and ſanctifying Grace of God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Perkins on Gal. c. 3. p. 256.</note> ſaith, That Baptiſm indeed ſaveth, but ſaith he, that is not the Baptiſm of Water, but the ſtipulation of a good Conſcience by the Reſurrection. Again he ſaith, the outward Baptiſm without the inward, is no mark of God's Child, but the mark of a Fool, that makes a Vow, and afterwards breaks it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. May not this Doctrine of theirs, clearly tend to ſcare and affright poor Parents with fear, that all their Babes that dye in their Mothers Womb, or before bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, are damned? And Oh, in what a ſad Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are all the Children of the ungodly and impious Perſons, whoſe little Babes you dare not, cannot Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, if you are true to your own Principles? But that Text may give us better ground of Hopes a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times, concerning the well being of our dying Infants, where our Saviour ſaith, <hi>for of ſuch are the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> and that alſo which you mention, <hi>I ſhall go to him, he ſhall not return to me;</hi> together with the infinite Mercy of God, through the virtue of Chriſt's Blood, who can convey help and healing to dying Infants and Ideots, in ways we know not of, nor are we to trouble our Selves about ſuch ſecret things that are not revealed.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Mr. <hi>Burkitt</hi> ſaith, the practice of Infant Baptiſm appears moſt beneficial, becauſe it prevents ſuch ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſcandalous neglects of Baptiſm, to the blemiſh of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Is it then a ſhameful ſcandal to neglect a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Man? (For ſo I have proved Infant Baptiſm to be) Where is the ſhame that ought to be in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that Chriſts Laws and Precepts are neglected, and his precious Ordinance of Baptiſm expoſed to Contempt and Shame, as it is by you and Thouſands more, whilſt the Statutes of <hi>Omri</hi> are zealouſly kept and obſerved, as the Prophet of old complained; I mean humane Rites and Traditions or Statutes, (like thoſe of <hi>Omri;</hi> inſtituted by him and <hi>Jeroboam)</hi> which the Wiſdom of your Church, and many corrupt Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

have been zealous for to this day; and thus I have run through and examined Mr. <hi>Burkitts</hi> Six particulars, which he brought to prove the uſefulneſs of Infant Baptiſm, above the baptiſm of Believers, which our Bleſſed Saviour Inſtituted; and now ſhall ſhew you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Infant Baptiſm is ſo far from being more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then that of the Adult, that it is a palpable error, and therefore of no uſe at all, but the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> a very ſinful thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> can that be uſeful, or any ways beneficial which Chriſt never Commanded or required to be done in his Name, but is unrighteouſly Fathered upon him, to the utter making void his own Ordinance of bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Believers?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Can that have any uſefulneſs in it, that brings guilt upon the Parents in doing it, making them guilty of Will, Worſhip, or of a humane Tradition?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Can that be uſeful that brings Babes into ſuch a Covenant, which Chriſt never Ordained them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into, and to which they directly nor indirectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented nor approved of; and which they are utterly unable to keep; and which giveth them no ſtrength to perform; nor is there one promiſe of God made to aſſiſt or help them to do it, and yet for not keeping of it, they are charged with Perjury, with ſelf Murder, nay, with Hell and Damnation?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Can that be of uſe to Infants that may baſely beguile and deceive them, cauſing them when grown up, to think they were thereby made Chriſtians, and become the Children of God, Members of Chriſt, and Inhabitants of the Kingdom of Heaven, nay, Regenerated; and from hence never look after any other work of Grace nor Regeneration, but conclude all is well with them?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Can that be an uſual thing, which the doing of it is a palpable alteration of the words of Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and ſo inverts that Holy Order left by him for baptizing, who requires none to be baptized be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be firſt Taught and made Diſciples?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Can that be of any uſe to an Infant which you, nor no Man elſe can prove from Gods Word, to have any uſe and Bleſſing in it to them?</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:65865:172"/>
7. Can an humane Rite or Tradition, think you, ſave poor Children, or a little Water ſprinkled on the Face, waſh away Original Sin? Or will God bleſs a Tradition of Man.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Can Water beget Children to Chriſt, or can that be uſeful to them, which they have only the bare ſign of, and not the thing ſignified, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sign of Regeneration, but not Regeneration it ſelf, a ſign of Grace, but not Grace it ſelf? you give them the Shell, but no Kernel; the name of a Chriſtian, but no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Chriſtian, making that you call Chriſt's Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, (as Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi>ſaith,) a ſign without effect, and like the Fig-tree in the Goſpel, full of Leaves, but no Fruit.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Can that be uſeful that tends to make the Goſpel Church National, (and confounds the Church and the World together) which ought to be Congregational, a holy and ſeparate People, like a Garden encloſed?</p>
            <p n="10">10. Can Baptiſm be more uſeful to Infants then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult Believers, notwithſtanding the Scripture ſaith, that the Perſon baptized, doth not only believe, but call upon the name of the Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 16.

            <p n="11">11.

            <p n="12">12. Can Infant Baptiſm be more uſeful then that of Believers, and yet Baptiſm call'd the Anſwer of a good Conſcience? Can a little Babe anſwer a good Conſcience by being baptized in Obedience to Chriſt, and to ſhew forth his Death and Reſurrection?</p>
            <p n="13">13. Can Infant Baptiſm be more uſeful then that of Believers? Whereas the firſt has no promiſe of God made unto it, and yet the other hath many, as <hi>Acts 2. 36, 37, 38. Mark.</hi> 16. 16.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Can that be an uſeful thing that fruſtrates the Sacred and Spiritual ends of Baptiſm? which we have ſhewed are many, but as adminiſtred to poor Babes, 'tis rendred wholly of none effect, and an inſignificant thing.</p>

               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:65865:172"/>
Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> hints that Baptiſm ſignifies two things, (1) our Union with Chriſt, (2) our Communion with him, now how does this appear in Infants as ſuch, as it does in Believers; <hi>Perkins</hi> on <hi>Gal. p.</hi> 265.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Is not that an abſurd Doctrine and Practice that renders the fruitful Womb of a godly Woman, more advantageous to increaſe, the Church of Chriſt, then a fruitful Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="17">17.

            <p n="18">18. Is not that an abſurd Doctrine and Practice that holds forth, that godly Parents have power to bring in their Children into the Covenant of Grace, or keep them out of it? for if you by baptizing them do not bring them into the Covenant of Grace, but you do believe they were in the ſaid Covenant by being born of Believers, by being begotten by you according to the Fleſh, then it will follow, if we are Believers, our Children are in as good a Condition as yours, though they were never baptized.</p>

            <p>
               <q>YOu ſay, if Parents would perform their Duties towards their Children, and how to make a right uſe of their Baptiſm, there would be more Godlineſs and Sobriety in the Country, and few would be the number of them that deny their Baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. But as to the right uſe of their Baptiſm, you your Selves cannot tell what uſe that can be to them, becauſe 'tis not appointed of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Did Parents inſtruct their Children according to the word of God, <hi>viz.</hi> to believe and get Union with Chriſt, and not baptize them till they deſired it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scripture, Infant Baptiſm would ſoon vanquiſh.</p>

2. Though 'tis true, an adult Perſon hath no right to Baptiſm that is not a true believer, yet if he profeſs Faith in Chriſt, and a Miniſter not knowing his Heart; but ſees no cauſe to doubt of the reality or truth of his Faith, he may baptize ſuch; but you have no Warrant to baptize a Child upon the profeſſion of its Parents Faith, tho' his Faith be ſincere.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <q>2. When they are Born prepare to Preſent and Conſecrate them (ſay you) to the Lord through the Sacred Ordinance of Baptiſm, there are many that baptize all their Children as matter of Ceremony, and meer Cuſtom without looking to the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Whoever therefore Baptize their Infants, do it only as a Ceremony diviſed by Man tho' not in their intention, their Conſciences being missed.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You ought (ſay you) to be ſerious about their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, as we ſhould be about our own baptiſm; that which the Child ought to do, if he had been at Age and Underſtanding, muſt be done by you for them, even as Mothers when their Children be Sick, take Phyſick themſelves, which the Children ought to take, ſo that the Child may have the Medicine in his Mothers Milk, even ſo do ye that which the Child ought to do, if he had been of Age before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed.</q>

               <p>In anſwer to Mr. <hi>James Owens</hi> 19th Chapter wherein he gives advice to Children, with an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his Queries, that he would have the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedobaptiſts to reply unto.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <q>CHildren, bleſs the Lord for the priviledges of your Baptiſm, God hath taken you into Covenant (ſay you) with your Parents, he hath prevented you with the bleſſings of goodneſs, and made you nigh, who being by Nature a far off, ye are no more Strangers and Foreigners, but fellow Citizens with the Saints and the Houſhold of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 19.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Muſt they bleſs God that their Parents de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them with falſe hopes of priviledges, which neither they nor your ſelves know what they are, or for putting a cheat upon them to make them think their State is better thereby, and yet cannot prove it from Gods Word ſo to be. How doth God prevent them with bleſſings of Goodneſs, by your Rantizing them? doth your pretended baptiſm inſuſe grace or
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:65865:175"/>
gracious habits unto them, or what to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, or is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t the bleſſings of that Vow you brought them under vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, without any authority from God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Are you not afraid to affirm that Children by their baptiſm are by the Lord made neer unto him, and made thereby Children of God, who were by Nature Children of Wrath, <hi>and no more Strangers and Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> &amp;c. If this was ſo, ſhall they not be all Saved? Can any thing bring Children near to God, and make them fellow-Heirs and Citizens with the Saints, but a Sacred Work of God's Spirit upon their Souls, and doth your Baptiſm do this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Can ſuch that are no more Strangers to God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ever periſh? Is there a poſſibility of Final falling from a State of true Grace; and if it be thus ought not your Children to have all the priviledges of the Houſhold of God, the Lords Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Will you attribute thoſe High and Sublime Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that belong to believers, who are only born of the Spirit, to your poor Babes that yet remain Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Wrath and unrenewed by the Grace of God, is not this a ready way to blind the Eyes of your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ruine their Souls if they ſhould believe you herein.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>You are under that Gracious Providence</hi> (ſay you) <hi>which watcheth over the Church,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſw.</hi> You muſt firſt prove them Members of the Church; and not only Members, but all of them elected Perſons, for they are ſuch Members, that the ſpecial Providence of God is over.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You ſay they have a ſhare in the daily prayers that are put up for the Church of God. <hi>Pſalm 72. 15. Prayers ſhall be made for him, and daily ſhall he be praiſed.</hi> Pſalm 51. 13. <hi>Do good in thy good pleaſure to</hi> Zion <hi>and build the Walls of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>Gal. 6. 16.</hi>
               <q>
                  <hi> As many as walk according to this rule, peace on them, and mercy on the</hi> Iſrael <hi>of God.</hi> If you had been without baptiſm, you ſhould have been without, and ſo without any ſhare in theſe prayers.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have put ſome of the Texts of Scripture down at large that you cite, and doth that Text in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 72. 13. not relate to Jeſus Chriſt perſonally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, if not only ſo, yet Chriſt miſtical, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:65865:176"/>
elect Seed, and not to all the Members of the viſible Church as ſuch, and ſo alſo in the other Scriptures, and dare you thus abuſe the Sacred Scriptures, applying theſe prayers and promiſes to all your Infants.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Do your Children as ſuch, walk according to that Rule <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 16. are they all new Creatures, read the Context or do you not falſly apply and interpret theſe Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And if all unbaptized Perſons be without any ſhare in thoſe prayers, you your ſelf are without them, for you was only Rantized. But what ſtreſs do you lay upon Baptiſm? Are none Membes of Gods Myſtical and Spiritual <hi>Sion,</hi> but ſuch who are baptized.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Alſo how do you go about to blind, and deceive the Souls of your Children in cauſing them to believe they are Members of Gods <hi>Sion,</hi> and have part in thoſe prayers, when it may be 'tis falſe, or no ſuch thing, they being (ſome of them when grown up,) wicked or ungodly.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <q>3. (Say you) as you are Members of the Church of God, you have a particular right unto the promiſes, the inheritance of the Church are the promiſes, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto her, and not to others, as formerly the promiſes belonged to the Viſible Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo now to the Viſible Church of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Rom. 9. 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 23.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have proved that our Children as ſuch, are not Members of the viſible Church; no, nor ought any of the Children of Believers to be taken into it, but ſuch that believe that repent, or that are born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If any others, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch that are not regenerated are taken into the viſible Church, whether <hi>Infants</hi> or <hi>Adult Perſons,</hi> 'tis not by God's appointment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch have no right to the Special and Spiritual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, which are the peculiar inheritance of the elect of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The viſible Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> as ſo conſidered, had many external promiſes belonging to them, that is not deny'd, which the Gentile Church hath no right unto; but the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, or all her viſible Members had not a right to the Spiritual Promiſes of God, <hi>They are not all Iſrael that are of Iſrael,</hi> Rom. 9. 6.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:65865:176"/>
               <hi>neither becauſe they are Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>are they all Children,</hi> verſ. 7. <hi>that is they are the Children of the Fleſh, theſe are not the Children of God, but the Children of the Promiſe are counted for the Seed,</hi> verſ. 8. You mention the 4 Verſe, but mention not the Verſes I have cited, which open the 4th verſe, and thus you go about to give a falſe Expoſition of the Scripture, and deceive the underſtanding of your poor Children, and others alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But ſay you, though the whole Members of the viſible Church, be not partakers of the Grace of the Promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 1. which are given to the elect only, yet all the Members of the viſible Church have more right to this Grace then others that are without, it being their own Fault if they refuſe it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> You in the firſt place ſpeak right here, but what you ſpeak in your next Words are utterly falſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You ſay the whole Members or all the Members of the Viſible Church be not partakers of the grace of the promiſes; this is right, but why do you ſay that all the Members of the Viſible Church have more right to the promiſes then thoſe poor Souls who are enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the way into the Viſible Church in all ſincerity of Heart. 'Tis I fear dangerous for people to ſet under ſuch a Teacher. I affirm that the State of ſuch that are let into the Viſible Church, who are unſound or carnal Perſons, is worſe then the State of others: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they under the promiſes of grace above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: for</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, they conclude perhaps all is well with them and that they are converted, becauſe the paſtor of the Church, nay, and the Church her ſelf ſo judgeth of them, and from hence they look not after regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or true Convertion, but look upon themſelves to be Holy, or Saints of God; now the promiſes of Grace do not run to theſe, as they do to thoſe, that ſee themſelves loſt and undone Sinners, being far from God, and out of the pail of the viſible Church, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you do your Children great Miſchief and hurt, in taking them into your Churches, unleſs they are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and truly gracious, 'tis no bleſſing nor benefit to be falſe Members of the viſible Church? but what do you mean by the laſt Clauſe, is it the Sinners ſault if
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:65865:177"/>
he is not elected, or can Men obtain Grace if they will. True, they ought not to refuſe God's Call.</p>
            <p>
               <q>(Say you) your baptized Children ſeek a clear underſtanding of that Obligation, and the Vow of your baptiſm, Learn of your Parents and Miniſters to know the ſignification, and need of your Baptiſm, ye are given unto Chriſt, and are not your own, ye are bound to renounce the Devil and all his Works, to renounce the pomps and vanity of this wicked World, to renounce the pleaſure, and luſts of the Fleſh, you are bound to take God the Father to be your God and chief end, taking the Son to be your Lord and Saviour unto you, and God the Holy Ghoſt to be your Sanctifier, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe that are baptized ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Nature of that Obligation before they enter into that Covenant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The end of Baptiſm was Ordained by Chriſt to ſhew that the Perſon baptized is born again, is dead to ſin, not that he ought, or is bound afterwards to be Born again; no no, but after he is baptized he is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thereby to walk in newneſs of life. You by bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Infants invert the deſign and end of Baptiſm; how ſhould your Children underſtand this Obligation, when their Parents and Miniſters are ſo ignorant about the nature of that Obligation themſelves?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Believers do thus take God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt in baptiſm, to be their God, but ſo do not Infants by any appointment of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It appears that you approve of the Church of <hi>Englands Catechism,</hi> if ſo all your Baptized Infants are according to your Doctrin in Baptiſm regenerated and have thereby renounced the Devil and all his Works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <q>3. As ſoon as ye come to Age and Underſtanding renew your Covenant with God, the Lord hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his Covenant the Faith of your Parents for you in your Infancy, but now ye are of Years, if ye your ſelves will not believe and repent, and take God to be a God unto you, your baptiſm will not longer bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer if it be thus your Children are not much beholding to their Parents Faith, nor to Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:65865:177"/>
Grace, you tell them when their Parents believed and were ſaved, all their Children were ſaved, and in covenant with them; but it appears now this only ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for their Infant State, they may fall out of the Covenant of Grace, and be damned, notwithſtanding their being once in the covenant of Grace, and ſaved with their Parents; unleſs they do actually be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But if they had dyed in their Infancy, perhaps they would have periſhed, had not their Parents belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is this your meaning; certainly if they are ſuch that are Elected they ſhall be Saved, tho' they had dyed in Infancy, tho' their Parents believed or not believed, doth the Parents believing procure their Salvation, and the Parents not believing obſtruct their Childrens Salvation, and ſo bring on them Damnation, if ſo the Salvation and Damnation of their Children in Infancy, is put into the hands or Faith of their Parents.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And if this be ſo, wo to the poor Babes of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, muſt they be all Damned? Can't Chriſt ſave ſuch Children by his Merits and Righteouſneſs, nor Sanctifie them that die in their Infancy, unleſs their Parents do believe, and baptize them; and dare you ſay he will not, what ſtrange Doctrine is this; and by what authority do you aſſert thoſe things which your Doctrine leads you out to do.</p>
            <p n="4">4. True, all our Children are Obliged by the Lord, when they come to Years of underſtanding, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their Creator, and to Fear, Love, Believe and Serve him, by the Authority and Command of his Bleſſed Word, but not by virtue of any Baptiſmal Vow he hath appointed for them in Infancy, to come under, or enter into, the State of Children in Infancy, may through Chriſts Merits be faſt enough, if they Die then, whether their Parents believe or not, and it apppears the Priviledges and Bleſſings of their Parents Faith doth them no good any longer, but only whilſt they continue in Infancy.</p>
            <q>
               <p n="4">4. You bid your Children that are grown up to live anſwerable to their Covenant.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Say you, give not place to Temptation, in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Firſt Baptiſm.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:65865:178"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let your Children take heed that they are not blinded by your pretended baptiſmal priviledge, ſo as to think they are any ways the better for that. Young Men and Women, 'tis not your Patents Faith will intereſt you in the Covenant of Grace, there is a twofold being in that Covenant.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Decretively. 2. Actualy</hi> all Gods Elect ones are <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretively</hi> in the Covenant of Grace, but no one Soul, either Man or Woman, is <hi>actually</hi> in it, untill they have by Faith Union with Chriſt. O! labour after this Union, you are all the Children of Wrath by Nature, and your Infant Baptiſm alters not your State, nor had you any right to baptiſm when you were Infants, but if you do believe you may and ought to be Baptized by vertue of Chriſt's Commiſſion or Authority of God's Word. Let not your Faith ſtand in this matter in the Wiſdom of Men, but in the Power and Authority of the Word of God; to walk according to the Rule of the Holy Scripture herein, is not to give way to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation; but to the dictates of God's Spirit, let Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſay what he will.</p>
            <q>
               <p>You bid your Children to ask ſuch, who deny In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant baptiſm theſe following queſtions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Say you, ask them, Can they prove from the Scripture that the Children of the Faithful were caſt out from the Covenant of Grace. Let them ſhew us a plain Scripture for that: for if they are not caſt out of the Covenant of Grace, then baptiſm, the Seal of the Covenant belongeth unto them.</p>
            </q>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Young Men and Women, pray ask Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> whether all the Children of the Faithful (or their Children as ſuch) were, and are in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If he ſays they all were, and ſtill are in that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, ask him whether then it doth not follow that they ſhall all be ſaved, becauſe the Everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace <hi>is well ordered in all things and ſure,</hi> 2. Sam. 23. 5. and the promiſe of the eternal. Life ſure to all the true Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4. 16. confirmed by the Promiſe and Oath of God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 13. to the <hi>19th. verſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Ask him, whether the true Spiritual Seed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> are not all Elected to Salvation, or the Elect of God.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:65865:178"/>
4. Ask him whether there is any final falling away out of the Covenant of Grace, or poſſibility for one of God's Elect, eternally to periſh.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Ask him if God did not make a Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s fleſhly Seed as ſuch, that peculiarly appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to them, in which the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were taken into an External, Legal, and Typical Church State, and ſo was a National Church, and had many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Priviledges, which our Children have not.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Ask him whether the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> both Parents and Children, were all in the Covenant of Grace, and ſo God's People by way of Special Love and Eternal Election.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Ask him whether the Carnal Seed of believers as ſuch, are to be taken into the Viſible Church in the times of the Goſpel, as they were under the Law. If ſo, ask him why <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> did refuſe them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Ask him how he can prove that the fleſhly Seed of believers as ſuch, are the true Spiritual Seed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi>

A Learned Man ſaith, <hi>There are many of the Seed of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>to whom the word of promiſe did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long then, the rejection of many</hi> Jews, <hi>who are of the Seed of</hi> Abraham <hi>doth not make void the word of promiſe; from

whence, may we not ſafely conclude,</hi> That if the Natural poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> were not within the Covenant of Grace by Vertue of the promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 2. then much leſs are our Natural Poſterity, but the former is true, therefore the latter.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Ask him whether the Covenant of Grace, ſimply in its ſelf gave right to Circumciſion, if ſo why was not <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> Circumciſed, were they not in the Covenant of Grace?</p>
            <p>This being ſo, ask him if he can prove that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, ſimply conſidered in its ſelf gives any a right to baptiſm, ſince 'tis a meer poſitive Command of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Ask him whether ungodly Parents that ſpring from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Loyns by <hi>Iſaac-</hi>in their Generations, were not as much obliged by God's poſitive Command to <hi>Abraham</hi> to Circumciſe their Male Children, as the Faithful and Godly Parents were obliged to Circumciſe theirs, this being ſo;</p>
            <p n="11">11. Ask him why all ungodly perſons and unbelievers ought not now to Baptize their Children, as well as believers, ſhould baptize theirs.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <q>2. You bid your Children ask ſuch that deny In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptiſm, can they prove from Scripture that Chriſt came in to the World to make the condition of Children worſer then it was before.</q>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Tell Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> he hath had this Queſtion anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this Treatiſe, over and over, <hi>viz.</hi> Tell him, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Priviledges of Children now are more then theirs were under the Law: So that our Children loſe no Divine and Spiritual bleſſings or priviledges, which the Children of the Faithful once had. God hath the ſame love to, and care of our Children under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as he had to theirs under the Law; but the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral bleſſings of the Jewiſh Children, and their Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or Earthly priviledges, then were more then our Children have in Goſpel times, the Goſpel Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes, theirs were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the promiſe of heaping up Gold and Silver, and poſſeſſing outward peace, and to enjoy a Land that flowed with Milk and Honey.</p>
            <p>True the external or outward diſpenſation of the Goſpel Covenant, which our Children are under, far

exceeds theirs for the clearneſs of Light and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of Chriſt, and for other Spiritual priviledges ours excells: Beſides no doubt, but the Children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers under the Goſpel far exceed the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of unbelievers by the bleſſings of a Godly Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the like. But we ſay it was not the Covenant of Grace that gave right to Circumciſion under the Law, but the poſitive Law and Command of God, ſo 'tis not the Covenant of Grace that gives right to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, but Chriſts poſitive Command, which runs not unto our Children untill they do believe; and bid Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> prove that Infant baptiſm doth make the condition of Children, any ways better then the condition of our Children, who never were baptized.</p>

               <q>4. If the Baptiſm of Infants be evil, why doth the Devil (ſay you) Tempt <hi>Witches</hi> or <hi>Sorcerers</hi> to deny that Baptiſm?

            <p n="2">2. What aſſurance can he give to Infants, or to their Parents that the Children they baptize ſhall be better Chriſtians thereby? Alſo how will he prove that the Children of believers who were baptized in Infancy, prove generally better Chriſtians then the Children of thoſe Believers that did not baptiſe them in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy.</p>

            <p>NOw <hi>Reader,</hi> from what thou haſt heard or read, in this Treatiſe, and anſwer to Mr. <hi>James Owen,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I may infer that all thoſe who have only been Sprinkled or Rantized, who are afterwards Baptized when they Believed, are not re-baptized, as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> doth affirm, nor do they renounce their Baptiſm, tho' they do renounce the practice and Human Tradition of Sprinkling of Infants or Adult Perſons.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:65865:182"/>
2. We may alſo infer that 'tis a hard thing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore a loſt Ordinance, or to reform about a long ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Cuſtom and Tradition of Men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Do all you <hi>Pious Parents</hi> bleſs God for Chriſt and the Goſpel, and for all thoſe priviledges he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon you, and upon your Children, who when they are grown up, ſet under the precious and clear Preaching of Chriſt Crucified. Be ſure, improve theſe bleſſings and take heed that you walk in all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of God's Word, and do not <hi>follow a Multitude</hi> to do evil, (tho' ſome of them are good Men.)</p>
            <p>O tremble to do any thing in God's Worſhip without lawful authority from him, I mean precept or example from his Word, do not adventure to Baptize, much leſs to <hi>Rantize</hi> your Children any more, whatever Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> (or any Man on Earth ſaith) unleſs you can find it written in your Bibles. God hath not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you to bring them into a baptiſmal Covenant in their Infancy, nor made any promiſe of bleſſing to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them in performing that Covenant, if you do bring them into it of your own Head voiuntarily.</p>
            <p>If you do, and will do this thing, notwithſtanding you have no authority from God's Word to do it; Pray conſider what I have ſaid in this Treatiſe about this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed and unwarrantable Covenant, by which you may heap up much guilt upon your ſelves, and lay ſuch a Load and Burden upon your Children, that you are not aware of: Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s frightnes them with the Sin of Perjury, who violate this Covenant, may not this tend to drive them into deſpair, and God will never charge them with Perjury, ſince he never commanded them to enter into any ſuch Covenant: Your Children who when grown up if wicked and ungodly have too much guilt, both Original ſin, and Actual ſin, lying upon them, there is little need to add to their Burden; for their want of Light, and by Reading of ſuch Mens Books, they may perhaps thus charge themſelves. Mr. <hi>Dan. Williams</hi> ſays, <hi>'tis the damning ſin:</hi> no no, the Damning ſin is the breach of God's Law, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the ſin of unbelief.</p>
            <p>Nay, and doth not his words Imply that when your Children are grown up, and they by Light received
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:65865:182"/>
from God's word, ſhould be couvinced they were never baptized at all, and ſo caſt off and renounce their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants <hi>Rautiſm,</hi> that they hereby become guilty of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and muſt be Damned, for he ſpeaks not of thoſe ſins forbidden in God's Word, but the violation of this baptiſmal Covenant, which he ſaith is Perjury, and <hi>the Damning Sin,</hi> and <hi>Root of all Sin.</hi> O! what want of Charity is here in theſe Men, and what New and ſtrange Doctrine do they Teach!</p>
            <p n="2">2. Train up your Children in the fear of God, and ſet them a good example, and pray for them, and over them and give them good Inſtruction, godly Counſel and Admonition: And ſee that you neglect not to Catechiſe them daily, that ſo they may underſtand early, the main Grounds and Principles of Religion; but dread to Baptize them in Infancy, or before they believe and have the inward and Spiritual Grace ſignified in true Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>You have had it proved from God's Word, that there is no Ground nor Authority from thence to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize Infants, and know 'tis not in the power of Man by external Rite, to bring Children into the Covenant of Grace, nor to make them Members of his Viſible Church: neither Baptiſm nor the Lords Supper are Bread for Infants; but for Chriſt's New Born Babes, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 5. not for your Children as ſuch, but ſuch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that are the true Children of God, who are born of the Spirit.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Do not go about directly nor indirectly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your Children, by making them believe they are in a good condition, by reaſon they are the Seed of believing Parents, and Baptized as theſe Men call Sprinkling, and ſo that way made Chriſtians, and ſo from hence perhaps look for no further or other work of Grace, or regeneration; but think they by this pretended baptiſm are the Children of God, Members of Chriſt, and Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven; when 'tis in Truth no ſuch thing, nor have you any cauſe to doubt but that your Infants, who die tho' not baptized are happy, as appears from what we have ſaid, neither be you ſo ignorant to believe that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm can ſave your Infants, or the Adult either; nor let poor Children cry out againſt their ungodly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:65865:183"/>
as ſome of theſe pedo-baptiſts intimate they may do. Pray ſee what Mr. <hi>Burkitt</hi> ſaith in his Book. <hi>page 62. Before your Children are born, make ſure as much as in you lieth, that they may be born within the Covenant, and under the promiſe, by your being in Covenant with God Your ſelves; ſee that the Lord be your God in Covenant with you, and then you may comfortably hope he will be the God of your Seed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Doctrine implys, that 'tis in the power of Men and Women to bring their Children into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and as alſo it denotes that the Children of believers are not Born Children of Wrath by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for are thoſe that are born in the Covenant of Grace, born Children of Wrath? O ye <hi>Parents,</hi> know that you may be in Covenant, and your Children never in it whilſt they live, nay die out of Covenant, as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs many Children of the Faithful do. Nor hath God made any ſuch Covenant with any believer, and their Natural Seed as ſuch, as he made with <hi>Abraham, who was the Father of all that believe,</hi> but ſo are not you nor I, tho' we are believers and in Covenant with God, and walk in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Steps. Thoſe that are in the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Grace of your Seed, never fear, but God will in due time bring into the Covenant of Grace, and give all the Covenant Bleſſings and Priviledges, but if any of them are not comprehended in the Election of Grace, their being born of your Loyns, will not, cannot bring them into the Covenant of Grace, nor give them a right to the Seal thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the holy Spirit; nor can baptiſm bring any into it, which is only an outward Sign of our being in that Covenant, or of that divine and ſpiritual Grace we received, before we were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed as I have proved.</p>
            <p>Your buſineſs and your Childrens alſo, is to make your own Election ſure, by ſpecial and effectual calling.</p>
            <p>'Tis not the firſt birth, but the ſecond that brings either you or your Children into the Covenant of Grace, ſo that we and they may have God to be our God by way of ſpecial Intereſt.</p>
            <p>But mark Mr. <hi>Burkitts</hi> next words, <hi>page 62. O! were but Infants capable of knowledge, how much would they dread being born of wicked Parents? make it your endeavour
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:65865:183"/>
before your Children are born to ſanctifie your poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, this is done by prayer,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is enough to ſet the Children againſt their ungodly Parents, nay to hate them in their Hearts: <hi>Alas!</hi> the Children of wicked Parents, I ſee not, but they may be in as good a Condition as many Children of believers (tho' I doubt not but God doth let out his infinite Grace generally more to the ſeed of the Faithful when grown up then to others) but God will not certainly deſtroy poor Children for the fault and unbelief of their Parents. Therefore as your beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in the firſt birth, tho' gracious cannot ſave them, ſo your begetting them, tho' wicked cannot damn or deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is no reaſon</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins, that the wickedneſs of the Parents ſhould prejudice the Children in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to eternal Life.</hi> Perkins on Gal. 3. <hi>p.</hi> 264.</p>
            <p n="2">2. However if it be as Mr. <hi>Burkitt</hi> and Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſay, that when believers are in Covenant their Children are in Covenant alſo; Doubtleſs they are in a ſafe condition, whether baptized or not, that doth not bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenant.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But may not this Doctrine of theirs, put a juſt rebuke upon unbelievers or ungoly perſons, for once attempting to Marry and beget Childre that are in ſuch a ſad condition, by reaſon their Parents were not in Covenant with God, ought they, nay may they law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Marry, this being conſider'd, and ſuch dreadful effects following, upon their poor Babes; beſides, how far doth this Covenant bleſſing and priviledge extend? If my <hi>Grand Father,</hi> was in Covenant, tho' my Father and I too, are wicked and ungodly Perſons, are not we ſtill in Covenant with God. The Covenant of <hi>Peculia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> viz. that of Circumciſion, extended not only to his immediate Seed or Off-Spring; but to all his Natural Seed ſucceſſively in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, untill Chriſt came and put an end to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Covenant, and Covenant Right.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Query,</hi> 1. Whether the being the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as ſuch, gave them a right to Circumciſion, or rather the meer poſitive Command of God to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham?</hi>

            <p>To this the <hi>Athenian Society</hi> anſwer, amongſt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Hereticks, they never met with ſuch a ſtrange poſition as this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith was the priviledge of <hi>Abraham</hi> only. <hi>Is this an anſwer?</hi> Beſides they miſtake, it is not a Poſition, but a Queſtion.

            <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> anſwer. <hi>It Seals and did ſeal to all that did belong to Chriſt, Life and Salvation, but to ſuch as do not, it Seals nothing at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply. How dare any Man Seal the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Salvation to ſuch, who have not that Faith <hi>Abraham</hi> had, before he received that Seal? It was not a Seal of that Faith he might have, or might not have afterwards, but of that Faith he had before he received it. Secondly I affirm Baptiſm is no Seal at all of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, for if it was, and of God's appointment, all that are Sealed would be ſaved; even <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> but many who are Baptized, may periſh eternally, and do no doubt.</p>

               <hi>Query</hi> 4.

If you ſay when they believe, they ſhall partake of thoſe privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and bleſſings; ſo ſay I ſhall the Children of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> as well as they.</p>

            <p n="2">2.

            <p>As to the <hi>Minor;</hi> If there is an Inſtitution for it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis either contained in the great Commiſſion, <hi>Mat. 28. Mark</hi> 16. or ſomewhere elſe.

The <hi>Major</hi> none will deny.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> I prove thus. None are to be baptized by virtue of the Commiſſion, but ſuch who are Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled by the Word, as I ſaid before, and ſo the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Beſides, That Teaching (by the Authority of the Commiſſion) muſt go before baptizing, we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; which generally all Learned Men do aſſert: If the Inſtitution is to be found any where elſe, they muſt ſhew the place.</p>

But they Ignorantly affirm alſo, that Infants then have a Federal Holineſs, as if this imagined Holineſs comes in by the Parents Faith, or by the Childs Covenant in Baptiſm, which may prove hurtful &amp; dangerous to them, and cauſe them to think Baptiſm confers Grace, which is a great error. How can water (ſaith Mr. <hi>Charnock)</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal thing, work upon the Soul Phyſically? <q> nor can it (ſaith he) be proved that ever the Spirit of God is tied by any promiſe to apply himſelf to the Soul in a gracious operation, when Water is applyed to the Body. If it were ſo, then all that were baptized ſhould be ſaved, or elſe the Doctrine of Perſeverance falls to the Ground. Some indeed (ſays he) ſay, that Regeneration is conferred in Baptiſm upon the Elect, and exerts its ſelf afterwards in Converſion. But how ſo active a Principle as Spiritual Life, ſhould lye dead and a ſleep ſo many years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not eaſily conceived. <hi>On Regen. page</hi> 75.</q>

            <p>As touching the <hi>Major,</hi> I argue thus; that which is an Inſtitution of Chriſt, the Holy Scripture doth ſhew, as well the end, and ground of the Ordinance, as the ſubject and manner of it; but the Scripture ſpeaks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the end and ground of Pedo-baptiſm, or for what reaſon they ought to be baptized, <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is no Inſtitution of Chriſt.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> will not be denied.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is clear, becauſe there is no Scripture ground for it, no Command or Example for ſuch a Practice in God's Word, and if without Scripture Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, the Church hath power to do one thing, ſhe may do another, and ſo <hi>ad infinitum.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> cannot be denyed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is eaſily proved: For he is bold indeed, who ſhall affirm Infant Baptiſm doth not lie obſcure in God's Word. One great Party who aſſert it, ſay, its not to be found in the Scripture at all, but 'tis an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Apoſtolical Tradition: Others ſay, it lies not
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:65865:191"/>
the Letter of the Scripture, but may be proved by Conſequences; and yet ſome great aſſerters of it, as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and others ſay, thoſe Conſequences com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly drawn from divers Texts for it, are without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration and prove nothing. I am ſure a Man may Read the Scripture a Hundred times over and never be thereby convinced, he ought to baptize his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, though it is powerful to convince Men of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Duties.</p>
            <p>Now can this be a Truth, ſince Chriſt was more Faithful than <hi>Moſes;</hi> and delivered every thing plainly from the Father? <hi>Moſes</hi> left nothing dark as to matters of Duty, tho' the Precept and Eternal Rites of his Law were numerous, even two or three hundred Precepts; yet none were at a loſs, or had need to ſay, is this a Truth or an Ordinance, or not? for he that Runs may Read it.</p>
            <p>And ſhall one poſitive precept given forth by Chriſt, who appointed ſo few in the New Teſtament, be ſo obſcure; as alſo the Ground and End of it, that Men ſhould be confounded about the Proofs of it, together with the End and Grounds thereof? See <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 5, 6.</p>

ought not to be baptized; but Baptiſm is of meer poſitive right, wholly depending on the Will and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign pleaſure of Jeſus Chriſt, the great Legiſlator, and he hath not required or Commanded Infants to be baptized, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Infants ought not to be baptized.</p>
            <p>This Argument tends to cut off all the pretended proofs of Pedo-baptiſm, taken from the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> and becauſe Children are ſaid to belong to the Kingdom of Heaven, it was not the Right of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Male Children to be Circumciſed, becauſe they were begotten, and born of the Fruit of his Loyns, till he received Commandment from God to Circumciſe them. Had he done it before, or without Command from God, it would have been Will-worſhip in him to have done it; Moreover, this further appear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This being true, it follows, that if we ſhould grant Infants of believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as ſuch, were the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which we deny, yet unleſs God had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to baptize their Children, they ought not to do it; and if they do it without a Command or Authority from Chriſt, It will be found an Act of Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip in them.</p>

               <hi>Arg.</hi> 21. If the Sins of no perſons are forgiven them till they are Converted, then they muſt not be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65865:193"/>
for the forgiveneſs of them, till they profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be Converted; but the Sins of no Perſons till they are Converted are forgiven; <hi>Ergo,</hi> no Perſon ought to be Baptized for the forgiveneſs of them, till they profeſs they are Converted.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in the ſaid Treatiſe, lays down the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this Argument alſo, take his own words, <hi>i. e.</hi> 
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>As their ſins are not forgiven them till they are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 12. So they muſt not be baptized for the forgiveneſs of them, till they profeſs themſelves Converted, ſeeing to the Church <hi>non eſſe</hi> and <hi>non ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parere</hi> is all one. Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus, is the Sum of that Preaching that makes Diſciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 21. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaith he, both thoſe muſt by a Profeſſion ſeem to be received, before any at Age are baptized. <hi>page</hi> 30, 31. and evident it is, ſay I, from hence that none but ſuch at Age ought to be baptized.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> cauſed the <hi>Eunuch</hi> to profeſs before he would Baptize him, <hi>That he believed that Jeſus Chriſt was the Son of God. Saul</hi> had alſo, ſaith he, more than a bare profeſſion before Baptiſm, <hi>Acts 9. 5, 15, 17. page</hi> 28. The Promiſe it ſelf, ſaith he, doth expreſly require a Faith of our own, of all the Adult, that will have part in the Priviledges; therefore there is a Faith of our own, that is the Condition of our Title, <hi>Mark 16. 16. page</hi> 16.</p>
            </q>
            <p>He might have added by the force of his Argument; therefore Infants ſhould not have the priviledges: For I argue thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 22. If there is but one Baptiſm of Water left by Jeſus Chriſt in the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or but one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or manner of Right thereto; and that one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is that of the Adult; then Infant Baptiſm is no Baptiſm of Chriſt; but there is but one Baptiſm in Water left by Chriſt in the New Teſtament, and but one Condition and manner of Right thereto, and that one Baptiſm is that of the Adult. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Infant Baptiſm is no Baptiſm of Chriſt.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith, Faith and Repentance is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Adult, and as to any other condition, I am ſure the Scripture is ſilent, The way of the Lord is one, <hi>one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm,</hi> Eph. 4. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:65865:193"/>
If profeſſion of Faith were not neceſſary, ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter, Coram Eccleſia,</hi> to Church Memberſhip and Priviledges, then <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> would have Right, alſo, ſaith he the Church and the World would be confounded. He might have added, but <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> have no Right to Church Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis a granted caſe among all Chriſtians, ſaith he, that profeſſion is thus neceſſary, the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Church</hi> admitted none without it. <hi>page</hi> 21. And if ſo, why dare any now a days admit of Infants, who are uncapable to make profeſſion? He adds, </p>
               <p>Yea Chriſt in his Commiſſion directeth his Apoſtles to make Diſciples and then Baptize them, promiſing, <hi>He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mark 16. 16. page 27. Furthermore he ſaith, </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If as many as are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into Chriſt, are baptized into his Death, and are Buried with him by baptiſm into Death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed from the Dead, ſo we alſo ſhould walk in new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life,</hi> &amp;c. Then no doubt, ſaith he, but ſuch as were to be baptized did firſt profeſs this mortification, and a conſent to be buried, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In our Baptiſm we put off the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh, by the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of Chriſt, <hi>being buried with him and raiſed with him through Faith, quickened with him, and haveing all our Treſpaſſes forgiven,</hi> Coll. 2. 11, 12, 13. and will any Man, ſays he, yea will <hi>Paul</hi> aſcribe all this to thoſe that did not ſo much as profeſs the things ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? Will Baptiſm in the Judgment of a wiſe Man, do all this for an <hi>Infidel,</hi> (or, ſay I, for an Infant) that cannot make a profeſſion that he is a Chriſtian. <hi>page</hi> 31, 32. he proceeds.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 23. The baptized are in Scripture called Men Waſhed, Sanctified, Juſtified; they are called Saints, and Churches of Saints. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. all Chriſtians are Sanctified ones, <hi>page</hi> 33. now let me add the <hi>Minor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Infants are not in Scripture called Men Waſhed, Sanctified, Juſtified; they are not called Saints, Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Saints, Chriſtians, nor Sanctified ones, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Infants ought not to be baptized. If any ſhould ſay why did you not cite theſe aſſertions of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> whilſt he was living? I anſwer, more then Eighteen years ago, I did recite and Print theſe aſſertions, and many other

Arguments of his to the ſame purpoſe, to which he gave no anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 24. If there is but one way for all, both Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Children to be admitted in the Goſpel Church, to the end of the World, and that it is upon profeſſion of Faith to be baptized; then both Parents and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren muſt upon the profeſſion of their Faith be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and ſo admitted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But there is but one way for all, both Parents and Children to be admitted into the Goſpel-Church to the end of the World, and that is upon the profeſſion of their Faith to be Baptized, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 25. That cannot be Chriſt's, true baptiſm wherein there is not, cannot be a lively Repreſentation of the Death, Burial and Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, together with our Death unto Sin, and vivification to a New Life; but in the Rantizing or Sprinkling of an Infant there is not, cannot be a lively Repreſentation of Chriſt's Death, Burial and Reſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 26. That pretended Baptiſm that pretends to fruſtrate the glorious end and deſign of Chriſt in his Inſtituting of Goſpel Baptiſm, or cannot anſwer it, is none of Chriſt's Baptiſm; but the pretended baptiſm of Infants tends to fruſtrate the glorious end and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Chriſt in Inſtituting of Goſpel Baptiſm, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> will not be denied.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Minor,</hi> all generally confeſs the end and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Chriſt in Inſtituting the Ordinance of Baptiſm, was in a lively Figure to repreſent his Death, Burial and Reſurrecton; with the Perſons Death unto Sin, and his riſing again to walk in newneſs of Life, that is baptized; as the Sacrament of the Supper was ordained to repreſent his Body was broke, and his blood was ſhed. But that a lively Figure of Chriſts Death, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and Reſurrection, appears in Sprinkling a little Water on the Face, I ſee not, (and as done to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant) there can no Death to ſin, and riſing again to walk in Newneſs of Life be ſignified; and therefore Chriſts deſign and end therein is fruſtrated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 27. If Baptiſm be Immerſion, as to the proper and genuine Signification of the word <hi>Baptizo</hi> as alſo of thoſe Typical and Metaphorical Baptiſms, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Signification thereof; then Sprinkling cannot be Chriſts true Baptiſm. But Immerſion is the proper and

genuine ſignification of the word <hi>Baptizo,</hi> and alſo of thoſe Typical and Metaphorical Baptiſms ſpoken of, and the ſpiritual ſignification thereof, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Sprinkling is not Chriſt's true Baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the proper and genuine ſignification of the word <hi>Baptizo</hi> is Immerſion, or to Dip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We have fully proved, which is alſo confeſſed by all Learned in that Language.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Typical Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> wherein the Fathers were buried, as it were unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Sea, and under the Cloud, appears from <hi>Pools Annotations. 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 2. </p>

               <p>The Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> (ſaith he) were both a Type and Figure of the Reſurrection, not the Sign of the waſhing away of Sin, tho' ſo taken Meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymically, but a particular ſignal of the Reſurrection of Chriſt. Of this, Baptiſm is a Lively and Emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Figure, as alſo was the <hi>Ark</hi> of <hi>Noah,</hi> out of which he returned as from a Sepulchre, to a New Life.</p>
            </q>
            <p n="3">3. Metaphorical Baptiſm is that of the Spirit, and of affliction: The firſt ſignifies not a Sprinkling of the Spirit, but the great Effuſion of the Spirit, like that at <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> Acts 1. 4, 5. <hi>Shall be Baptized,</hi> &amp;c, On which words <hi>Causabon</hi> ſpeaks thus: See Dr. <hi>Du Veil</hi> on <hi>Acts</hi> 2. <q>The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

becauſe it was promiſed to the Apoſtles, that they ſhould be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt.</q> And the Baptiſm of afflictions are thoſe great depths or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmings of afflictions, like that of our Saviours <hi>(magnis componere parva)</hi> no part free, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 22. where you have the ſame word <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>This being ſo, it follows undeniably that Sprinkling cannot be Chriſts true baptiſm; it muſt be Immerſion and nothing elſe.</p>
