            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>REctum eſt Regulaſui,
&amp; obliqui,</hi> is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
Axiom among
the Mathematicians; the ſame
may be ſaid of that thrice Noble
Science call'd <hi>Anatomy,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Grand Foundation, or if I
may ſo ſay, the Corner-ſtone both
of Phyſick and Chirurgery, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the latter, it being the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi>
on which we build all our Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
towards the Cure of Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
both External, and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
for how is it poſſible we
ſhould pretend to Cure any Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Affect, unleſs we know what
Part or <hi>Viſcera</hi> is affected; the
<pb facs="tcp:52388:3"/>
like may be ſaid in Chirurgical
Caſes; for what Surgeon can
give a true Prognoſtick in Wounds,
Vlcers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or Reſtore Luxated
or Fractured Limbs, or perform
any Manual Operation, without
a true Knowledge of the Oeconomy
of Humane Body; and this ought
not to be a bare Knowledge only of
the Parts, and where they lye (as
many who are unwilling to give
themſelves the Trouble of Scruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
into the more nice Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of them) but we ought alſo
to know the Figure, Structure,
Vſe, what Juices they ſeparate,
and the like, all which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Anatomy</hi> teaches; for
to what a prodigious height is the
Art of Medicine improved, ſince
our moſt Ingenious and Accurate
Countryman, Doctor <hi>Harvey,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52388:3"/>
found out and demonſtrated the
Circulation of the Blood; <hi>Jolivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>

and <hi>Haver's</hi> the Articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Glands; with many more
great Improvements, which are
too long to mention; nay, the
whole Method of Phyſick is almoſt
alter'd; and this Great and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Work could ne'er have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
had thoſe Learned Men
contented themſelves with a bare
Knowledge o the Parts only; for
ſuppoſe any had a Pile of Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Erect, would they think
you, employ any one who is Ignorant
of what Figure of Size the Stones
or Timber ought to be, and how
to be join'd together? The ſame
may be ſaid of a Chirurgeon, or
Phyſician, who is ignorant of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52388:4"/>
ſo that whoever is
willing to perform the Duty of a
Good and Conſciencious Surgeon,
ought to know the whole Fabrick
of Man's Body; and that as well
in its perfect, and ſound ſtate,
as morbid, that he may re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
Health when loſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
unſound Parts to their former
Sanity.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not here Harangue, or
run out in the many Praiſes which
are due to <hi>Anatomy,</hi> or Treat
of its Origin and Antiquity; it
being already ſo excellently well
perform'd by the Learn'd Doctor
<hi>Charleton,</hi> in the Preface to his
Anatomic Prelections, but proceed
to the Matter in hand.</p>
            <p>Various are the Opinions of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
about the Parts we ought
to begin with, in Anatomical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations.
<pb facs="tcp:52388:4"/>
               <hi>Bartholinus</hi> ſays,
We ought to begin with the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
they being firſt in view,
then proceed to the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and
Muſcles, and laſtly, end with
the Bones; and the Reaſons he
gives for it, are becauſe the Bones
cannot be examined before they
appear, which they cannot do,
(ſays he) 'till all the Muſcles
are ſeparated from them; others
begin with the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> or
Lower Belly, ſo proceed to the
<hi>Thorax,</hi> then to the Head, and
laſtly, to the Extremities; by
reaſon the Belly is apt to ſend forth
in a little time, very noiſom and
offenſive Smells, which would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Operator from proſecuting
his intended Deſign: 'Tis true
this is the beſt way, ſuppoſing we
have but one Subject to work on,
<pb facs="tcp:52388:5"/>
and that we be obliged to ſhew all,
or moſt of the Parts on this one
Subject.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galen</hi> ſays we ought to begin
with the Bones, and gives many
Cogent Reaſons to prove it; firſt,
becauſe they ſerve as Beams or
Supporters of the whole Body. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
they ſerve to faſten the
Muſcles too; for how can we tell
the Origin or Inſertion of any Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
if we be wanting in the true
Doctrine of the Bones; nay, all
the Parts ſeem as if deſign'd for
their uſe; for when the Bones
ceaſe to grow, they alſo put a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
to the growth of all the other
Parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laurentius</hi> ſays, that in the
Anatomical School of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>
the Young Students in
Medicine, always began their
<pb facs="tcp:52388:5"/>
Anatomical Courſe with the <hi>Oſteo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi>
and then proceeded to the
Doctrine of the Muſcles, ſeveral
of which receive their Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from the Bones, which they
paſs by, or lye on, as the <hi>Tibia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
Poſticus,</hi> and <hi>Anticus</hi> the
<hi>Peronii, Scapulares, Sterno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hyoidei,
Maſtoideii,</hi> &amp;c.
Laſtly, the Knowledge of the
Bones is of that great uſe to a
Surgeon, that it's impoſſible for
him to reſtore well a Fracture or
Diſlocation, who is Ignorant of;
the Structure, Figure, Articula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Fractured or
Diſlocated Bone.</p>
            <p>All theſe Reaſons are a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Inducement to perſwade us,
that we ought to begin with the
Skeleton, and then proceed in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
to the Reſt of Man's Body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:52388:6"/>
The Skeleton is an Aſſemblage
of all the Bones of the Body; it's
either Natural, or Artificial; the
Natural, is when the Bones are
all excarn'd, but kept together by
their proper Ligaments; the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
one, is when the Bones
are Artificially Cleans'd, Whiten'd
and Join'd together by Wiers.</p>
            <p>That part of <hi>Anatomy</hi> which
Treats of the Bones, is call'd <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteologia,</hi>
which is as much as
to ſay, A Diſcourſe of the Bones.</p>
            <p>We ſhall in this Tract examins
what belongs to the Bones in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and what belongs to each
particular; which we ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
in ſeveral Demonſtrations.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> defin'd a Bone to be the moſt
hard,<note place="margin">Antient De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition.</note> firm, and terreſtrious part of
all the Body. <hi>Laurentius</hi> adds, and
ſays, That it's ingendred by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative
Faculty, by reaſon of great
heat, out of the moſt craſs and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrious
part of the <hi>Semen,</hi> to ſerve
as a Foundation to all the Body, and
to give it Shape and Figure; but this
Definition, as it is not compleat e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
ſo on the other hand, the
word Faculty, is a Term which they
uſed to expreſe themſelves by, when
they were at a loſs for an Anſwer or
Solution to any Queſtion propoſed;
beſides, it's not at all agreeable to the
Idea we have of the formation of the
Bones, or Uſe; yet it's certain the
Antients made uſe of that Term to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
moſt of the Actions of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
for when they were to declare
how the Chyle, or Blood was made,
or how the Bones or Cartilages were
form'd, nay, how the Senſes acted;
they anſwer'd, That the Stomach had
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52388:7"/>
a Chylific Faculty, the Liver a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guifying;
the Bones were form'd by
an Oſſific, and the Cartilages by a
Cartilaginous Faculty, that the Eye
ſaw by the Viſive Faculty; <hi>&amp;c ſic de
caeteris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was a general Anſwer, by
which they eluded (as well by their
occult Qualities) all Difficulties pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to them, ſo that their Pupils
were as Ignorant at the finiſhing of
their Studies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as at the beginning;
but we at this Day explain all theſe
Actions purely Mechanically; as I
ſhall ſhew in demonſtrating each
part of the Oſteology exactly, that
the Action which it performs, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
depends on its Structure, ſo
that it can do nought elſe, but what it
does.</p>
               <p>But to return from whence I have

which is about the time when the
Bones have attain'd their full perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of growth, which alſo puts a
period to the bulk and magnitude of
the Body, ſo that they are no more
extended or enlarged, either in
breadth or length.</p>
               <p>The Bones are compoſed of many
ſtrings,<note place="margin">Compoſition of ſtringy Fibrils.</note> or threads, which have their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52388:8"/>
courſe according to the length of the
Bones, or their Figure; for if the
Bone be of an unequal, or irregular
Figure, the ſtrings are alſo unequal,
and irregular; except in the <hi>Cranium,</hi>
where the threads begin at a point,
(ſometimes two or more) for the
moſt part in the Centre, and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in the Circumference of the Bone,
as the Spokes in a Wheel; for which
reaſon it's more thick, and compact
there, than in the Circumference,
the thready Fibrils being more cloſe
and united there, which is viſible in
the <hi>Cranium</hi> of a <hi>Foetus;</hi> the Bones
have alſo ſome tranſverſe Fibres, to
hold the long ones in; which may be

ſeem to be three diſtinct Bones united
juſt in the middle of the <hi>Acetabulum,</hi>
but in time, as the Oſſification in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes,
they grow more ſtrong, the
fibrous threads join, and ſo make but
one Bone; for if the Bones ſhould
have been totally Oſſified before the
Birth,<note place="margin">Why the Bones are not totally Oſſified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Birth.</note> how ſhould the <hi>Foetus</hi> paſs
through the <hi>Vagina</hi> of the Womb as
it doth? For it's without Diſpute, that
both the Bones of the Head, and alſo
the Hips of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> give way ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
in time of Excluſion; for it's
obſerved that thoſe Animals which
have long and ſmall Heads,<note place="margin">☜</note> but big
Bodies, have the Bones of their Head
wholly Oſſified before the Birth, but
their Ribs not, ſo careful is Nature in
this Affair.</p>
               <p>In the Skull, and moſt broad thin
Bones, as the <hi>Sternon,</hi> the Oſſificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
begins at two, three, or more
points, commonly about the Centre;
Nature is alſo very cautious in Oſſify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
long Bones all at once; for if
their Extremities had been Oſſified as
ſoon as their middle, the ligamentous
and tendorous threads would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52388:9"/>
ſo eaſily their ends, to join them
together, which they can do, being
not totally Oſſified. The Oſſification,
as I ſaid afore of the <hi>Oſſa Innominata,</hi>
begins at three points, that they may
have the greater ſolidity; but quite
contrary in the Bones of the <hi>Cranium,</hi>
for while the middle of moſt Bones of
the <hi>Cranium</hi> are fully Oſſified, their
edges are only Membranous, that
they may give way ſomewhat in time
of Birth, which they would not, were
the <hi>Cranium</hi> compleatly Oſſified.
Theſe are the Reaſons why Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards
Oſſification in ſome Bones, and
advances it in others.</p>
               <p>The Bones before they be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
indurated,<note place="margin">Veſſels.</note> have many Blood-veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
which are obliterated, as ſoon as
the Meduller Glands are large enough
to ſeparate the Oily Particles from the
Arterial Blood, (which have a Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of keeping the Bones ſoft) then the
Oſſific Liquor which is emitted from
the aforeſaid Glands hardens them,
and ſo preſſes the Parts cloſer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and hinders the Blood from paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52388:10"/>
they were ſofter, their bony threads
gave way, and being then not preſt
ſo cloſe; which Veſſels are alſo boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the Oſſific Juice, having loſt
their firſt uſe; yet ſome few remain,
which ſerve only the Meduller Glands,
for their Nouriſhment, the Pulſation
of Blood in them having ſtrength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to ſcatter the Fibrils of the
Bones in that Part, and ſo makes paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
for themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Bones are nouriſhed two ways,<note place="margin">Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment two fold.</note>
the one in their beginning, that is,
when they are only Membranous, and

for now they are nouriſhed as all

you then cut them, you'll find every

have occaſion of greater ſolidity, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
then changes her way of Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment,<note place="margin">When Bony.</note>
which is by a peculiar Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor

that if the Fibrils of the Bones be
any ways broken, that it ſheds it ſelf

large.</p>
               <p>We muſt alſo obſerve a difference in
the Bones,<note place="margin">Difference of the Bones according to Age.</note> according as we grow in
Years; for from the Birth to the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
Year, or thereabouts, the Bones
continually increaſe, and from that to

ſtay, neither increaſing or diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but after that they daily dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
by reaſon of the bony Fibres dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
approach nearer one another,
and ſo muſt conſequently have a leſs
bulk.</p>
               <p>The Colour of the Bones is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
in all;<note place="margin">Difference from the Colour.</note> for ſome have them very

It's true,<note place="margin">Perioſtion.</note> as I have obſerved before,
that the Bones have no ſenſe; yet
they are Inveſted with a very ſenſible
Membrane, call'd <hi>Perioſtion,</hi> as if
we ſhould ſay a Membrane over or
inverſing the Bone, it's very thin;
all Bones have this, except the Teeth.
I think there's a great Queſtion about
its Uſe.<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> Some affirm it's to convey
bloody Veſſels to the Bones; but its
rather believed to be for the greater
implantation of the Tendons of the
Muſcles; for when you ſeparate the
<hi>Periostion,</hi> the Muſcle comes off with
it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now proceed to the manner
of the Articulation of the Bones;
there's ſuch Art in the Conjunctions
of the Bones,<note place="margin">Articulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Bones.</note> that they have ſerved as
a pattern to many Artizans in their
Curious Works; for they could find
nothing in Nature more fit to copy by;
and although there be ſo many vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ways of Articulation, as almoſt
Junctures, yet they are all neceſſary,
otherwiſe Man could never move him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
every way ſo compleatly as he
does.</p>

The Bones join'd together have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>Articulation,<note place="margin">Articulation twofold.</note> is either for manifeſt,

Demonſtration ſhews the contrary.</p>
               <p>The Sutures have many uſes,<note place="margin">Vſe of the Sutures.</note> the
principal are theſe; 1. Many Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous
Fibres paſs through them
from the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> to the <hi>Pericrani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
which ſuſpends the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi>
ſo are a ſort of hinderance of too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Concuſſions of the Brain, in any
great motions of the Body; for by
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52388:26"/>
theſe Fibres the Brain is kept more
light; it's by this Communication,
that when the <hi>Pericranium</hi> is wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
an Inflammation often ariſes in
the <hi>Dura, Mater,</hi> as if it had received
ſome offence it ſelf: Theſe Fibres alſo,
by ſuſpending the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and
keeping it cloſe to the Interior Surface
of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> the Arteries in the
Cortical part have a freer motion,
which would be ſomewhat impeded,
if it fell on the Brain. 2. They give
paſſage to ſeveral Veſſels, that are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and repaſſing to the Diploe, for the
Nouriſhment of the Bones of the <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium.</hi>
3. They are of uſe in hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fractures from paſſing further
than one Bone, for they always ſtop
at the Sutures, which if the Skull were
but one continued Bone, the Fracture
would be apt to run over all the <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi>
as may be ſeen daily in any
Earthen or Glaſs Veſſel, when crackt
by a ſtroke, it commonly runs almoſt
quite over, or round. Some ſay, a
fourth Uſe is, to give a vent or breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to many Fuliginous Vapours ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
within the <hi>Cranium,</hi> but I much
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52388:27"/>
queſtion this uſe; yet ſome ſay, that
many who have had their Sutures too
cloſe, have been ſubject to inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Head-aches, Tranſpiration ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been ſtopt, as they ſay; but I
rather think it proceeded from the
preſſure of the Veſſels which paſs
through them, which cauſing an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the flowing Liquors, was
a cauſe of theſe Pains.</p>
               <p>There are many Obſervations in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Authentick and Learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,<note place="margin">Some have had no Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note>
of ſome who have had none,
or very few Sutures, and others who
have had more than uſual. I ſaw a
Skull lately in the Hands of an Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Chirurgeon, my very good
Friend, which had a Suture running
tranſverſe the Occipital Bone, and the
Sagittal paſs'd quite through the <hi>Os
Frontis,</hi> and it was the Skull of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult;
ſuch is the various Diſports of
Nature; alſo in very Old Age the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are almoſt obliterated, the Oſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic
Liquor then predominating.</p>
               <p>Embryons have no Sutures,<note place="margin">How the Sutures are made.</note> or at
leaſt not to be well diſtinguiſhed, their
Skulls being wholly Membranous; ſo
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52388:27"/>
while the Oſſific Liquor, (which as I
have ſaid, begins at a point, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in
the <hi>Cranium</hi>) inſinuates it ſelf along
the bony Threads, and by degrees har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
them, ſome Fibrous and Vaſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Strings paſſing from the <hi>Dura Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
to the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> hinders in
thoſe places the bony Liquor from u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting,
ſo forms theſe Seams or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
for in a <hi>Foetus</hi> the Skull being
as yet Membranous in its edges, wrap,
or fold themſelves as it were one over
another, to take up leſs room in the
Birth; for had the Skull been totally
Oſſified before the Birth, the Infant
would for the moſt part endanger the
Life of the Mother; this may be daily
ſeen in young Children, where the
Skull is wholly Membranous in the

Obſervations of ſome who have been

will be requiſite to ſay ſomething of
the Spine in General,<note place="margin">Of the Spine in General.</note> in which ſeveral
Things are to be taken notice of.</p>
               <p>1. All the Bones,<note place="margin">Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> from the firſt of the

2. The figure or ſhape of the Spine,<note place="margin">Figure.</note>
is of great Conſideration, for if you
look on its Anterior or Poſterior Parts,
it appears ſtreight; but if you look on
its Lateral Parts, its curved in and
out: Firſt, the Spondils of the Neck
bend inwards, for the better ſupport
of the <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> alſo to ſuſtain the
Head in an <hi>Equilibrium,</hi> then the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebrae</hi>
of the Back jet themſelves out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
to augment the Capacity of the
<hi>Thorax,</hi> that the Heart and Lungs
may have a larger room to play in;
towards the Loins again, they bend
inwards, not only to defend the great
Veſſels which lye on them, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to Counterballance the better the
weight of the Body; the <hi>Os Sacrum</hi>
bends outward, that the <hi>Pelvis</hi> be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
to contain the Bladder, Womb
in Women, and <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum;</hi>
and laſtly, the <hi>Os Coccygis</hi> bends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
that it might not be offended
when we ſit down, alſo that the <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinum
Rectum</hi> be tyed to it.</p>
               <p>The third Thing to be obſerved in
General,<note place="margin">Bodies of the <hi>Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae.</hi>
                  </note> or Common to all, is that

irregular bony Threads, containing a
Medullar Juice, of a Convex Figure
forwards, but Concave backwards,

the Body alſo of each <hi>Vertebra</hi> gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually

               <p>The <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Os Sacrum.</note> or holy Bone, ſo
call'd, as ſome think, becauſe the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
uſed to ſave this part as Sacred
in Sacrifices; but I think rather from
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the Greeks call it, which
ſignifies <hi>Magnum,</hi> as well as <hi>Sacrum,</hi>
it being the biggeſt Bone of all the
Spine. It's immoveable, and ſerves
as a <hi>Baſis</hi> or Pedeſtal to the whole
Spine; it's of a ſomewhat triangular
Figure, with the point downwards;
it's Concavous within, which helps
to form the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> alſo ſmooth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
it's <hi>Convex,</hi> and unequal, many
Muſcles ariſing, and being inſerted
here, it ſeems as if it were compoſed
of five or ſix Bones, (as indeed it is in
Infants) its Oſſification beginning at
ſo many points, but its edges, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if you will, its tranſverſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
look but like one continued
Bone, as it is; the <hi>Foramen Spinale</hi>
towards its lower part is very ſmall;
its <hi>Foramina Nervina</hi> are before and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52388:46"/>
behind, and not on the ſides, as in the
other <hi>Vertebrae;</hi> its ſpinal Proceſſes
are very ſmall, the laſt being only a
ſmall round Protuberance, it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Proceſſes are hardly viſible, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the ſuperior ones; the parts
which compoſe the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> are
plac'd in the number of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi>
not by reaſon of their uſe, but becauſe
of their reſemblance, for otherwiſe
they are immoveable: The <hi>Os Sacrum</hi>
may be ſaid to be divided into five
<hi>Vertebrae</hi> of different bigneſs, whereof
the ſuperior is biggeſt, they diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as they deſcend, the laſt being the
leaſt; theſe ſeperate eaſily in Infants,
by reaſon the Cartilages which unite
them, are not fully oſſified; but in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dults,
they all make up but one intire
Bone.</p>
               <p>This Bone ſeems to have ſeveral
Uſes,<note place="margin">Vſes.</note> the firſt is, as I have already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd,
to ſerve as a Foundation to
the whole Spine. Secondly, to help
to contain the parts of the <hi>Hypogaſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
by forming Cavity, as I have
ſaid. The third to defend them; the
fourth to Articulate the Bones of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52388:46"/>
Hips; the fifth to give Origin and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion
to many Muſcles.</p>
               <p>To the end of this Bone are annex'd
two or three little Bones call'd <hi>Oſſa
Coccygis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Oſſa Coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cygis.</note>
the Cuckow's Beak; ſome
call them the Rump-bones: They
have a ſomewhat looſe Articulation,
and tyed by Cartilages one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the laſt is the ſmalleſt: They
have this looſe Articulation, that
they may give way to the <hi>Foetus</hi> in
the Birth, therefore in Women theſe
Bones are always more bent back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
than in Men; they end in a
Cartilaginous point, to which is tyed
the <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum;</hi> they have no
thing more material in them, having
neither Proceſs nor Cavity.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now proceed to the Bones
of the Breaſt and Ribs,<note place="margin">Bones of the Breaſt.</note> which is the
ſecond Diviſion of the Trunk.</p>
               <p>The Ribs are twenty-four in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,<note place="margin">Ribs 24.</note>
twelve on each ſide; to be well-inſtructed
in all which concerns the
Ribs, we muſt obſerve ſeveral things,
as their Subſtance, Figure, Connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Parts, Diviſion and Uſe, of all
which in order.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:52388:47"/>
The ſubſtance of the Ribs is partly
Bony,<note place="margin">Subſtance of the Ribs.</note> and partly Cartilaginous, that
end next the <hi>Vertebra,</hi> being of a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and more ſolid and thick ſubſtance
than that towards the <hi>Sternon,</hi> which
is flattiſh, ſo leſs capable of being
broke; ſor that end towards the <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
being more ſpongy in ſubſtance,
all the Ribs end towards the Breaſt by
Cartilages, increaſing in length as the
Ribs deſcend; and thoſe Cartilages of
the ſuperior Ribs, are harder than
thoſe of the inferior; ſometimes theſe
Cartilages grow bony in Old People,
ſo that they cannot be ſeparated by a
Knife.</p>
               <p>The Ribs have a ſort of Semicircu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Figure,<note place="margin">Figure.</note> making a ſort of Arch;
when two are together, they make a
kind of a true Circle, Concave inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to form the Capacity of the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax,</hi>
and to contain the Lungs and
Heart, and Convex outwardly, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
outward force; the farther they
depart from the <hi>Sternon,</hi> the more
round they are in their own Body;
they are not equally big, for the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
are ſhorter, the middle biggeſt of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52388:47"/>
all, and the inferior one leaſt of all;
their upper ſides are thick, blunt, and
broad; one edge is call'd the interior,
the other the exterior Lip; their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
edges are ſharp, having in their
inſide a long <hi>Sinus,</hi> or Furrow, in
which lye the Intercoſtal Veſſels.</p>
               <p>The Ribs are Articulated by their
Extremities,<note place="margin">Articulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> both to the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of
the <hi>Thorax,</hi> and <hi>Sternon;</hi> that Articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
with the Back is moveable, the
other not; the long Head of each Rib
is Articulated by a ſingle <hi>Arthrodia;</hi>
it has a ſmall Protuberance cloathed
with a Cartilage, which head is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into a <hi>Sinus</hi> of the tranſverſe
Proceſs of the <hi>Vertebra;</hi> 'tis this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
which ſupports the Ribs, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
them from coming lower in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration:
You muſt obſerve,<note place="margin">N. B.</note> that the
back-part of every Rib is higher than
the fore-part, till the Cartilage be
join'd, which turning a little up,
makes the two ends of an equal
height, ſo that by the riſing of the
Ribs, the Breaſt is enlarged. We muſt
alſo take notice, that almoſt all the
Ribs have a Communication with the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52388:48"/>
                  <hi>Sternon,</hi> either directly or indirectly;
that is, the ſuperior ones are by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
inſertion, but the lower by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct,
which is by Cartilages adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to the ſuperior.</p>
               <p>All the Ribs make a ſort of Angle
by their Cartilages towards the <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
which ſerves to increaſe the
Spring of the Cartilages, that the
Ribs be brought down again, having
been rais'd in Inſpiration. It ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
happens, though ſeldom, that
theſe Cartilages are oſſified,<note place="margin">☜</note> which
occaſions an Incurable <hi>Aſthma;</hi> the
laſt, or loweſt Rib in Man, have no
Cartilage as the reſt; the lower
the Ribs, are, longeſt and more
movable,<note place="margin">N. B.</note> becauſe Reſpiration in Man
is downwards, but in Birds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>The Ribs are commonly divided in
two ſorts,<note place="margin">Ribs of two ſorts.</note> as true or falſe, but I think
they may well be all accounted true,
except the laſt, (being join'd mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
immediately to the <hi>Sternon</hi> by Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilages)
which has none, ſo only may
be term'd a falſe Rib; however it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a common received Opinion, I
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52388:48"/>
ſhall make the diviſion: the long or
true are ſeven on each ſide,<note place="margin">True 14.</note> and are
the ſuperior ones; the firſt of which
has no motion at all, it being as a
prop for all the reſt, but as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
they increaſe in motion; they
are Articulated to the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the
Back by a ſort of double <hi>Arthrodia,</hi>
which makes a <hi>Ginglimus,</hi> and to the
<hi>Sternon</hi> by <hi>Synarthroſis,</hi> the three low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of which are by ſome call'd the
Pectoral Ribs.<note place="margin">Coſtae Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorales.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The falſe or baſtard are five on each
ſide,<note place="margin">Falſe, 10.</note> the four uppermoſt of which
have at their Extremities towards the
<hi>Sternon</hi> long Cartilages, bending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and cleaving only one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
that is, the loweſt to the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior,
ſo not directly united to the
<hi>Sternon,</hi> as the firſt ſeven are; which
was the Reaſon the Antients gave
them the Name of Spurious: The laſt
has no Cartilage at its end, the edge of
the <hi>Diaphragme</hi> being tyed to it.</p>
               <p>All the Ribs, as I have already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated,
are received both into
the tranſverſe Proceſſes, and body of
the <hi>Vertebrae;</hi> except the two or three
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52388:49"/>
laſt, which are only received into the
body of the <hi>Vertebrae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ribs are to defend the Heart
and Lungs,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from all ſorts of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Injuries, ſo that they be not
preſt, but have free motion, which
were it not bony, would be always in
danger of being offended; they alſo
ſerve to ſuſtain the Reſpiratory Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
               <p>The Cartilages of the Ribs have this
Uſe,<note place="margin">Vſe of the Cartilages.</note> that is, when the Ribs are drawn
ſomething upwards in Inſpiration,
they draw them down again with a
ſort of Spring; for all Cartilaginous
Bodies are indued with a ſort of Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticity,
ſo that they always recover
their firſt Figure.</p>
               <p>This Mechaniſm is obſerved in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Animals,<note place="margin">☜</note> for in Birds the <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
is immovable, becauſe the flying
Muſcles ariſe from thence; ſo that if
the <hi>Sternon</hi> had any thing to do in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration,
it would be hinder'd;
therefore Nature has contrived another
Artifice, which is this, between eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Rib there's a little Bone, plac'd
ſomewhat obliquely, ſo that if one
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52388:49"/>
moves, the other follow by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>All theſe Birds have no Diaphragm,<note place="margin">☞</note>
but inſtead thereof two Bladders,
which reach to the bottom of their
Bellies, they ſerve for the <hi>Diaphrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
and alſo help to keep them ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
in the Air: Thoſe Creatures
which have a <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> breathe
downwards, but Birds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which
have none, breathe upwards.</p>
               <p>In Amphibious Creatures, as the
Tortoiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> their shell is in place
of Ribs, and Frogs have only one Rib
on a ſide, to defend the Lungs.</p>
               <p>The Breaſt-bone is call'd <hi>Sternon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sternon <hi>made up of three Bones.</hi>
                  </note> or
<hi>Os Pectoris,</hi> ſituated in the middle of
the Anterior part of the Breaſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of two or three Bones, having
the Productions of the Cartilages of

reddiſh fungous Subſtance.</p>
               <p>To conſider it well, it muſt be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
at two different times; for in
Infants it's almoſt all Cartilaginous,
except the firſt Bone where the <hi>Clavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culae</hi>
are faſtned. In Old People I have
ſeen it all oſſified, except the firſt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52388:50"/>
with the ſecond at its juncture, but in
thoſe of Middle Age, partly Bony,
and partly Cartilaginous, the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Bone always oſſifies firſt, and the
inferior laſt. In the <hi>Sternon</hi> of Infants
you may perceive ſeven or eight Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,

               <p>The Extremities,<note place="margin">Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Vpper and Lower.</note> or rather the

               <p>We will begin with the Superior;
but firſt I muſt inform you, that ſince
both Extremities are double, I ſhall
only ſpeak of them in the ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,

you at the ſame time ſhew the other.</p>
               <p>Although there be no part which

and ſince Nature has given
to all Animals, ſomething particular,
either to defend themſelves againſt
others, and preſerve themſelves from

we may ſay then, that Man has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
two things preferable to Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
to wit, Reaſon and Hands, the
one for Counſel and Conduct, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for Execution of our Will; 'tis
theſe Hands which gives him the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Command over all Creatures
be he never ſo Cruel, Strong, or
Swift; for of what Advantage would
all our Reaſon and Conduct be, if we
had not Hands to perform what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
dictates: I could ſay much more
on this Subject, but that I am here on

but it ought not to be numerated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

               <p>Theſe four Bones are united by their

and put them by themſelves, always ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Care by ſome mark to diſtinguiſh the
Right ſide from the Left. Fourthly, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the Cartilages from the bony Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of the Ribs in their very Coalition;
then ſeparate every Rib from the <hi>Vertebrae</hi>
of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> tying them one below ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in order, in a piece of Packthread, to
diſtinguiſh them rightly, obſerving alſo
always the ſide they belong to; take Care
in ſeparating them, they having a double
Inſertion, as well with the Bodies of the
<hi>Vertebrae,</hi> as with their tranſverſe Proceſſes.
Fifthly, ſeparate every <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the
Neck and Back one from another, hanging
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52388:68"/>
them in order on a ſmall Cord, that you
be not at a loſs in uniting them again when
boil'd alſo the <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Loins in the
ſame order from the <hi>Os Sacrum;</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the <hi>Oſſa Coccygis</hi> from that, and the
<hi>Oſſa Innominata</hi> from the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> ſo that
you may command, and cleanſe each in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
more commodiouſly. Sixthly, come to
the Limbs, beginning firſt with the Arms;
as for Example, ſeparate the <hi>Os Humeri</hi>
from the <hi>Cubitus,</hi> and that from the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi>
which when you come to, take Care in
ſeparating the Fleſh and Tendons from
them, that you may keep them as much as
poſſible in their due places; for which end,
I think it will not be amiſs to drill two or
three holes quite through each rank, in
which paſs a Wire or two that will hold
them in their right Situation, in time of
boiling, they have in been before ſeparated
from the Bones of the <hi>Metacarpus,</hi> which
four Bones you muſt alſo ſeparate from each
Finger, making ſome fitting Marks with
Thread, or the like, which ſuſtains one
Finger, and which another; and as for the
Fingers, put them in the Fingers of a
Glove, according to order; ſo there will
be leſs danger of Confuſion; the Leg is to
be ſeparated after the ſame manner as the
Arm, always making ſome diſtinguiſhing
Character, which belongs to the Right ſide,
and which to the Left.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:52388:68"/>
Some Bones require a longer time of
boiling than others,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sternon,</hi> will not <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

boiling at all, as the <hi>Sternon,</hi> with
its annex'd Cartilages; the large Bones
admit of longer boiling than the ſmall;
now ſuppoſe it be the Skeleton of a young
Subject, boil not above an Hour, or an Hour
and half at moſt, leſt the Cartilaginous
tips of the Bones come away; but in an
Adult you may boil longer, the older the
Subject is, the longer time is required in
boiling; but before you put the long Bones
into your boiling Veſſel, bore a hole in
their Extremities, large enough, according
to the bigneſs of the Bones, that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullar
Parts may have free <hi>exit</hi> in boiling;
to further which, run up the Bones ſo
drill'd, a red hot Wire to and fro, to make
a quicker diſpatch of the fatty Particles,
then caſt them into your boiling Water;
for it's this fatty Subſtance only, which in
many Skeletons makes them look ſo muddy
and dull; when you think your Bones ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
boil'd, let them be preſently taken
out and cleaned one after another, a faſt
as you can; it's very good to rub the Bones
with Maſons Duſt, which fetches off the
<hi>Periostion,</hi> and levigates them very well;
or you may waſh them in boiling Lye made
of Aſhes, which ſcowers and cleanſes them
very well; after they are thus cleanſed,
throw them in clean cold Water, in which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52388:69"/>
let them lye about half a Day, then take
them out, and wipe them dry, putting
them ſtill in the ſame order as they were
before you boiled them, and obſerving to
make the ſame marks of diſtinction; when
they are thus dried, place them on the
Leads of he Houſe for ſome Days and
Nights, eſpecially when the Dews fall moſt,
but keep them from the violent heat of the
Sun, that being apt to make them brittle;
by this means they will become as white as
Ivory.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sternon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> not to be boiled.</note> as I have told you, is not
to be boil'd at all, by reaſon the Cartilages
will ſhrink, and go out of their true Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
ſo that you cannot bring the Cartila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to their true Shape, to be annex'd to
the ends of the Ribs from whence they
were ſeparated, which will make your Ske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leton
deform'd neither will it endure too
great a heat in drying, ſo that you muſt
uſe very great Caution in preparing it,
which you may do thus, After you have
Artificially and Neatly ſeparated it, as I
have already taken notice of, cleanſe it as
carefully from the Fleſh as you can, then
let it dry moderately in the ſhade, always
ſtriving to keep the Cartilages in their true
Figure, and now and then picking away
what you find of fleſhy Particles; when you
think you have cleanſed it well, rub it all
over, eſpecially the Cartilages, with this
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52388:69"/>
mixture, made of Wax, Roſin, and Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine,
uſed very warm, for ſo you will
hinder them from drying, and growing
brittle, which they would be apt to do
otherwiſe, and likewiſe defend them from
the Worm and Moth, as alſo from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
ſo keep it whole by you till you
have occaſion to uſe it, in making up your
Skeleton.</p>
            <p>When your Bones are thus clean'd and
dry'd,<note place="margin">Method of uniting your Skeleton.</note>
then begin to unite your Bones to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
forming your Skeleton. Since the
Spine is the prop of all, and the <hi>Os Sacrum</hi>
the <hi>Baſis</hi> of that, you ought to begin with
it, as your Shipwrights do in making a
Ship, who always begin with the Keel, to
which they annex the other parts towards
compleating the Veſſel; the Spine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may well be call'd the Keel of Man's
Body, to which the reſt of the Bones of
the Skeleton are join'd.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Therefore prepare a fitting Rod
of Steel, ſo order'd that it may have an
Elaſtic Property, that is, when you bend
it, to return to its firſt Figure of ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
let it not be too thick, yet ſtrong
enough to ſupport all the <hi>Vertebrae;</hi> for by
this means you will have the Spine perform
all its motions. It muſt be a little more
than three Foot long, that it may paſs
through all the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> and come out of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52388:70"/>
the top of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> to hang the whole
Skeleton on; it muſt be ſmaller towards
its top than bottom, by reaſon the Bones
of the <hi>Vertebra</hi> grow leſs towards the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
part of the Spine; then Drill a hole in
the very Body of the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> through
which paſs your Steel Wire, which you
muſt Artificially faſten at the lower end of
the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> to ſuſtain all the reſt, then
paſs on the ſame Wire the reſt of the five
Bones of the Loins, according to their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
holes being Drill'd through the very
Bodies of all the <hi>Vertebra</hi> in the very Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
that they may fit exactly each other;
in the ſame manner paſs on the twelve <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebrae</hi>
of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> one by one, to which
join the Ribs likewiſe in order, beginning
with the loweſt; this unition muſt be made
with Braſs Wire, as well to the Bodies of
each <hi>Vertebra</hi> as tranſverſe Proceſſes, then
paſs on the Steel Wire to the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of
the Neck in their order, except the laſt,
which is call'd the <hi>Atlas,</hi> which muſt be
join'd to the Condiloid Proceſſes of the
Occipital Bone, by two fitting Braſs Wires,
ſo that the Head may have its due flexion
and extention; this being done paſs the
Steel Rod through the Medullar <hi>Foramen</hi> of
the <hi>Atlas,</hi> into the very Capacity of the
<hi>Cranium,</hi> to paſs through a hole Drill'd on
the top, that the Head and Spine may hang
regular, ſo the Head will have its Circular

motion, as well as flexion and extention,
that being perform'd by the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Neck, as this by the
firſt only, being join'd by a double <hi>Arthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>
to the <hi>Os Occipitis;</hi> when you have ſo
done, unite the lower Jaw by its Condiloid
Proceſſes into the Glenoid Sinuſſes of the
<hi>Oſſa Petroſa;</hi> then faſten the Teeth in
their proper <hi>Alveoli,</hi> with a preparation
of Roſin and Wax; then in its place hang
the <hi>Os Hyoides,</hi> alſo at the outward part of
the <hi>Foramina Auditoria</hi> hang the Officles
of the Ear in order; when you have done
this, faſten the <hi>Sternon</hi> and its Cartilages
to the Ribs, holes being Artificially Drill'd
through their Extremities, to faſten them
with Braſs Wire; then faſten the <hi>Clavicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
to the <hi>Sternon,</hi> to which unite the <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula,</hi>
which is not only to be faſtned with
its <hi>Acromium</hi> to the <hi>Clavicula,</hi> but alſo to
the Body of the Ribs, to which its flat ſide
lyes on, then paſs to the inferior part of
the Spine, and faſten ſtrongly the <hi>Oſſa In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominata</hi>
to the ſides of the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> ſo
as to be join'd even before at the <hi>Oſſa Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi>
which muſt be join'd together with
Wires, ſo the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> will be form'd, and
to the Extremity of the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> faſten
the <hi>Oſſa Coccygis,</hi> and ſo you will have the
Trunk with the Head extraordinary well
fitted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:52388:71"/>
Then paſs to the Limbs; firſt take the
<hi>Os Humeri,</hi> to whoſe lower Extremity u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
the <hi>Vlna</hi> by two Hooks, one fitly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted
to receive the other, which Hooks
muſt be faſtned one in the Extremity of
each Bone, ſo as the Bones ſit cloſe one to
another, for which end you may hollow a
little the Extremity of the <hi>Humerus</hi> with a
Graver, to make the Junctures the cloſer;
then to the ſide of the <hi>Ulna</hi> faſten the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi>
ſo that it may have its Prone and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
motion, which may be done thus,
Encompaſs its Neck pretty cloſe with a
Ring of Braſs Wire, (after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as the <hi>Ligamentum Admirabile</hi> doth,
which comes from the <hi>Ulna</hi>) which you
muſt faſten in the lateral <hi>Sinus</hi> of the Head
of the <hi>Ulnae;</hi> then adapt fitly, and in their
due order, the Bones of the <hi>Carpus,</hi> and
they having but little, or very obſcure
motion, you may only faſten them by their
ſides with Braſs Wire, holes being firſt
Drill'd through their very middle, alſo
faſten the firſt rank to the other according
to Art; when the <hi>Carpus</hi> is thus form'd,
unite the Bones of the <hi>Metacarp</hi> to them in
their due order; for which end, you muſt
have four little Braſs Hooks, fitted cloſe in
the Bones of the <hi>Carpus,</hi> to receive in order
four other little Hooks, one in each Bone
of the <hi>Metacarp,</hi> to be engaged in the four
firſt Hooks, faſten them ſo as the Bones
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52388:71"/>
may touch cloſe, and yet at the ſame time,
the Juncture to have its proper motions;
alſo faſten the ſides of the <hi>Metacarp</hi> one to
another with a piece of Braſs Wire, yet ſo
as the proper diſtance be kept where it
ought; then faſten the firſt <hi>Phalanx</hi> of the
Bones of the Fingers to the <hi>Metacarpus,</hi>
then the ſecond, and then the third, all in
their due place, which muſt be faſtned
with fitting Hooks, as in the Bones of the
<hi>Metacarp</hi> with the <hi>Carpus;</hi> laſtly, join the
<hi>Carpus</hi> to the <hi>Radius</hi> and <hi>Vlna,</hi> ſo that it may
have its proper motions: When you have
thus finiſhed the whole Limb, then faſten
it to the Trunk, but ſo as you may take it
off when you pleaſe, which may be done by
only faſtening a Hook on the very Head of
the <hi>Os Humerus,</hi> juſt where its Ligament
is, which is to be hung on a curved Braſs
Wire, which muſt be faſtned in the Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Scapula;</hi> the lower Extremity
muſt be managed after the ſame manner,
obſerving fitting Circumſtances, which
