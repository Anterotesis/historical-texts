         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

hath pleaſed God, to vſe meane perſons for the ſetting forth of
his glory. Hyſtoryes doe make mention of A Chriſtian child
named <hi>Frumelius</hi> that being taken priſoner, and brought into

ſome of the <hi>Indians</hi> to the Chriſtian faith, &amp; calling to his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
ſome fewe Chriſtian Marchantes, that were in thoſe

of the king of <hi>Iberia,</hi> who by the inſtructions of a Chriſtian

nothing but what your fathers haue beleeued before you, Saint

may abrogate their lawes, may diſpence with their ſubiectes for

               <p>Now whither a Chriſtian Prince, is not aſwell tyed in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

               </p>
               <p>Here might be a more ample addition concerning this matter
the wich I will not take vpon me to medle with.</p>
               <p>But that princes haue power to commaund for truth, and to
make lawes for Chriſt, ſtandeth not onely with probabilitie, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility,

religion and equitie, confirmed expreſſely by ſcriptures, and
plainly warranted by the lawes, actions &amp; examples of the moſt
famouſly learned, and renowned.</p>
               <p>Who maketh any doubt but that the Almighty God in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
the ſword into the hands of Princes, giueth them a direct
charge aſwell to prouide that true religion be maintained in then
realmes and dominions, as ciuil iuſtice miniſtred: and giueth
them no leſſe power to puniſh Schyſmes, hereſies, &amp; Idolatries,

               <p>But for this matter of conſcience, ſo much pretended by our
<hi>Iriſh Catholikes,</hi> I thinke there is neuer a papiſt in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that is
well able to diſtinguiſh truely of conſcience what it is.</p>
               <p>They make a matter of conſcience, of euery popiſh fantaſie,

               <p>The Turke that denieth <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and vpholdeth <hi>Mahomet,</hi> will
ſay as our papiſtes doe, his conſcience doth leade him ſo to doe,
&amp; they can alledge, <hi>why thus did our fathers,</hi> they beleeued thus, &amp;
in this beleife they both liued and dyed.</p>
               <p>The popiſh prieſts doe teach the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> to doe as their Fathers
haue done before them, and this doctrine is the right ready way
to leade to Hell: <hi>Walke you not in the precepts of your fathers, neither

               <p>Poore <hi>Ireland</hi> may rue the errours of their fathers, they haue

               <p>And therefore it is a ſtrange doctrine that is taught by thoſe

               </p>
               <p>Thus the people of that Countrey haue beene blinded and

their Fryers, their Ieſuites, and their ignoraunt popiſh
Prieſtes, vnder a pretence of Religion, ſeeke nothing elſe
but to hatch vpp and to drawe in Rebellion, colouring out all
their impieties, vnder the ſhowe of the Catholicke faith.</p>
               <p>By theſe holy pretences, they haue peruerted and miſledd
a number of good people throughout all the partes of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and that of all ſortes and degrees, that without doubt
would bee both tractable and conformable to the lawes of God
and the obedience of the Prince: their zeale in this religion
wherein they are ſo blindly ledd, is an euidence what feruency
they would ſhowe, if their eyes were once opened to beholde
the light of the Goſpell, now if the creatures of God are to bee
pittied, if there bee any compaſſion to be had, one Chriſtian to
an other, who would not commiſerate this people that are thus
carried away to their deſtruction, that are thus blindly ledd in
darknes, by theſe inſtruments of Sathan.</p>
               <p>Theſe thinges conſidered (though not affying in mine owne
witt or learning) yet nothing doubting but that there be many
good people in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to whom God hath giuen the ſpirite of
iudgement and vnderſtanding, for their ſakes therefore, and
further to expreſſe my good wil and the loue that I bare to that
Countrey, I indeuoured a Booke, which I intituled, <hi>A ſhort ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey
of Ireland.</hi> wherein I plainely diſcouered who it was that had
not onely blinded the ſimple and ignorant ſort, but alſo had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
thoſe that tooke vpon them to bee wiſe and learned: In
which booke I laboured nothing elſe, but ſo to diſplay the Pope,
in his perfect colours (and but according to the Scriptures and
as the word of God had teſtified of him) that I dare confidently
auowe, there is no Papiſt ſo ſimple, (or at the leaſt, if hee will
not ioyne obſtinacy with ignorance) but that hee ſhall playne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſee that Idolatrous prieſt, that hath ſo bewitched the worlde
with a ſhowe of holineſſe, to be that man of Sinne, to be that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
of the Deuill, to bee indeede that <hi>Antichrist,</hi> that hath
beene ſo much propheſied of, and of whom wee haue beene ſo
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16401:7"/>
often forewarned by the holy ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>It is he that hath drawne the kingdomes of the world to drink
of the Cup of his abhominations: it is he that hath hardened the
heartes of this poore people of <hi>Ireland,</hi> aſwell againſt their God,
as againſt their prince: and it is he that I haue ſought ſo to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to the <hi>Iriſhe,</hi> that he might no longer deceiue: and this I did
aſwell for the glory of God, for the ſeruice of my prince, as for
the loue that I doe beare to a number of that cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whom I doe with, as I doe to my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>I was not ignorant, but that it would be obiected, that I being
no Churchman, nor had no cure of ſoules, it would therefore be
thought a matter impertinent for me to meddle with.</p>
               <p>But I ſay, that the Lawe of God and the Law of nature both,
doe binde euery Chriſtian, to haue care (not onely of his friend)
but if hee ſhoulde ſee his enemie, in a dangerous path, that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
into that peryll that hee foreſeeth not, I ſay hee that ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
his brother ſo to periſhe, and will not call vnto him, and
giue him warning of the danger, hee is guiltie of his death, and
his bloude will bee required at his hands that ſo ſuffereth him to
periſh.</p>
               <p>Thus we are taught by the word of God, &amp; thus I am ſure we
are bound euer, chriſtian one to another.</p>
               <p>If my lines haue not taken that effect that I deſired, I haue
done my good will, and haue contented my ſelfe with the writing
of them, knowing mine owne intent, that was onely deſirous to

then to offend any.</p>

               <p>An excellent reſemblance to a vicious man, that knowing his

perhaps with ſome loathed deformities, doe thinke that a man
cannot write nor ſpeake any thing againſt vice or villany, but he

               <p>Some of theſe <hi>Hoglinges</hi> (as it ſhould ſeeme) haue had the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vſall

the reſt of theſe find-faults, that are ſo diſpleaſed with
my booke, what ſhould I ſay to him, that in the preſence and
hearing of no leſſe honorable then the Lord Deputy himſelfe,
would avowe, that booke to be no better then a libell, that was
firſt intended for the glory of God, for the ſeruice of his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie:
And that was licenced to the preſſe by authoritie, that the

by the moſt of the Lords of his maieſties moſt honorable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle.</p>
               <p>Now for him that in ſo ſaucy and malipert a manner, woulde
tearme that to be a libell, that hadde beene thus ſurueied and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlookt,
did rather argue a minde ouer loaden with malice, and
a tongue fraughted with lying and ſlandering, then any token ey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
of wit or modeſtie.</p>
               <p>But as wee are taught, wee muſt doe good againſt euill, and
the rather to ſhowe a charitable diſpoſition: I will doe as I am
taught, to pray for him, and in no worſe language then we bee

               <p>But that I am preſſed in mine own defence to make it known

that is offered by an enemie, may ſerue to cure &amp; heale our neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected

               <p>A wiſe manne may make great profite, by the reportes of his

may learne thereby to mende his faults: but this argueth our vile

               <p>But now to ſpeake to the mayne poynt, howe my Booke bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came

               </p>
               <p>It is truth, that in thoſe two Bookes, I haue made manifeſt

               <p>And although that the Popes wholl broode of vermine, as

blinde guides, that it may pleaſe GOD to open their eyes in

               <p>He that beleeueth not to day, ſhall haue grace giuen him, and
he may beleeue to morrow, in the meane time, I doe not deſpiſe
him, but I doe both pittie him, and pray for him.</p>
               <p>Theſe be the men to whom I haue adreſſed my lynes, and doe

               <p>And although that at this tyme, my deſire bee rather to take

               <p>They be the <hi>Agents</hi> and <hi>Factors,</hi> for the moſt inſatiable mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant

his owne traditions, hee ſelleth ſinne, hee ſelleth righteouſnes,
hee ſelleth CHRIST, hee ſelleth the bleſſed Sacramente
of his fleſhe and bloude: hee ſelleth the workes of Saintes,
hee ſelleth Chriſtes merites, hee ſelleth the people of God, he
ſelleth holy orders, hee ſelleth pardon and remiſſion of ſinnes,
hee ſelleth GOD and all his ordinances, and all for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
               <p>But is not this a monſtrous hypocriſie, that the Pope will be
called the ſeruant of ſeruants, and yet will take vppon him to be
the Lord of Lordes, and King of Kinges?</p>
               <p>The Pope is a more deteſtable enemie to the true <hi>Catholicke</hi>
Church then eyther Turke or infidell, for thoſe that ſeeke to
vphoulde his abhominations, thoſe hee maketh Saintes, and
thoſe that doe impugne his doctrine by the ſcriptures, them hee
perſecuteth, and againſt thoſe Princes where hee cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile

Bulles, them hee ſeeketh to confounde by poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng,
by ſtabbing, or by murtheryng in one ſorte or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Spoyles, maſſacres, and treaſons, euen to the deſtruction,
and murthering of Princes, by their ſeruantes and ſubiectes (if
a pryeſt doe but ſay the worde) are accounted iuſt, honorable,
meritorious, holy, but for a Prince to defende his owne right,
or in executing iuſtice vppon ſuch of the Popes <hi>Vagaboundes</hi> as
are ſent to ſeduce, to conſpire, and to practiſe villanie, he is an
hereticke, a ſchiſmaticke, a diſobedient childe to the Church,
and he muſt be poyſoned, ſtabbed, or blowne vp with gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
there muſt be ſome thing exployted againſt him, hee muſt
not liue, if <hi>God</hi> doe not defend him.</p>
               <p>This is the fruite of the Popes religion, and theſe be the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes
that are vſed by papiſtes, lette euery man therefore looke
well to his leader, that he be not blinde, for both the guids that
<pb facs="tcp:16401:11"/>

in the ditch, it ſhall be no excuſe to ſay, I was thus taught by my
ghoſtly father, or this is the fayth that our forefathers haue dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>When the worde of <hi>God</hi> is preached vnto men that be wicked
vnto whom <hi>God</hi> hath giuen no grace to receiue it, then are they
nothing thereby amended, but their heartes are the rather, the
more obdured, and the more the word of God is preached vnto
them, ſo much the more obſtinate they become, and the more
miſchiefe they intend: after this manner the heart of <hi>Pharao</hi> was
hardened, when the woorde of GOD was deliuered him by
<hi>Moſes,</hi> hee hauing no grace to receiue it, the more <hi>Moſes</hi>
indeuoured to expreſſe it, the more ſturdie was he to withſtand

               <p>But what neede we trauell into <hi>Egypt</hi> to fetch preſidents, when
wee haue ſo many home examples heere in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the
truth of Gods goſpell hath beene ſo long preached, and the

viſions, olde wyues tales, and a number of ſuch other mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>The Papiſtes haue euer more beene full of Myracles, but in
their Legende of Saintes, and in many other fooliſhe Bookes,
they haue fayned them ſo groſſely, that they are aſhamed to
heare of them, but GOD ſometymes, ſuffereth thoſe that
haue no loue to his trueth, to bee deceiued by lying Myracles,
for as the children of the trueth, ſhall naturally incline vnto

               <p>I might yet inlarge a great deale of other matter, but my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
is that the whole glory of the Popes Church is nothyng

A Reuocation of all ouer ſightes that through ignorance
were publiſhed in that Booke.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am come to the matter that is moſt of all
looked after, and that I am ſure is eſpecially
wiſht for, and that is <hi>A Reuocation of my ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſightes:</hi>
I know not how to behaue my ſelfe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
in this buſineſſe, for to ſquare in out to
there contentments that doe deſire it, would
wound mine owne credit, &amp; to reitterate thoſe things that might
pleade my excuſe, would ſooner breede a newe warfare of words,
then ſettle that quiet that I could wiſh: but they ſay, there is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſafety in an vniuſt warre, then in a patcht peace.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe, that if I had but halfe ſo farre ouerſhot my ſelfe, as
reportes were giuen out, a <hi>Reuocation</hi> in wordes onely would bee
too little to make amends, for I would acknowledge my ſelfe to
be worthy of ſhame and puniſhment both.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the booke is extant to be ſeene, &amp; to anſwere for
it ſelfe, I thinke my beſt courſe will be to ſet down thoſe oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that haue beene obiected againſt me, aſwell by thoſe that
were but miſinformed by other mens reportes, as of thoſe that
made malitious collections, exhibiting thoſe thinges againſt me
for ſlaunders, that were ſhamefull for them to bring into queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if they had beene well aduiſed.</p>
               <p>Me thinkes an eaſie perſwaſion might induce wiſemen to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
that he that will vndertake to inuey againſt Poperie, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by word or writing ſhall want no enemies in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that wil
both rayle and rage againſt him, and will ſo ouer load him with
lies and ſlaunders, that if they can not breake his backe, they will
yet be ſure to cracke his credit: amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the reſt of thoſe vntruths
that were obiected againſt mee, one is howe I ſhould affirme in
my booke that there is neither ciuilitie nor humanity to be found
amongſt the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> but that they are inclined to all maner of bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhnes.</p>
               <p>And although I neede no other anſwere to this but to turne
them to my booke, that they haue ſo ſlaundered and belied, yet
for better ſatisfaction I ſay, it is truth that I haue ſpoken of the
<pb facs="tcp:16401:12"/>
manners and cuſtomes that are vſed amongſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in ſome
partes of the Country, that are not yet ſo conformed from there
vnciuill demeaners, nor ſo perfected in the complements of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
but that they retayned ſtill their accuſtomed vncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines:
now if I ſhould ſay that in ſome partes of <hi>England</hi> it ſelfe,
there bee many people that are both rude, ignorant, and verie
clowniſh, as it is well enough knowne there are ſo (indeede) could
this be a diſparagement to the whole realme?</p>
               <p>But they will ſay I haue made no exceptions amongſt the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,</hi>
but haue numbred them all to be in one predicament, let me
intreate them but to ouerlooke my Epiſtle to the Reader in that
booke where they ſhall finde theſe wordes.</p>
               <p>Doe not thinke mee to be ſo generall, but that I doe make a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernce
betweene thoſe that are rude, vnciuile, vnreuerent, vncleanely,
and vntaught, and thoſe other againe, that are milde, modest, kind, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
and that are euery way indued with wit, reaſon and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
And I doe make the like exceptions betweene thoſe that are irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
ſuperstitious, Idolatrous, ſeditious, rebellious, that do retayne Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites,
Seminaries, and other Traiterous Prieſts, then of thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe
are profeſſors of the Goſpell, that doe imbrace the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and doe indeuoure themſelues in the ſeruice of God, and in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to their Prince.</p>
               <p>I hope I may reuoke this without any diſgrace, I haue beene
charged with a lie, and I renounce it.</p>
               <p>A ſecond obiection was, that I had taxed the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in generall
to bee more ſauage and cruell then the <hi>Canibals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is as true as the firſt, and needeth no other purgation,
then what is contained in the booke it ſelfe, and firſt in the 36.
page, <hi>I ſay that thoſe of the Iriſh that haue reduced themſelues to ciuili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
(were it not for their Religion) are otherwiſe of very good conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and aſwell in their manners as in the decency of their apparell, they
are very modeſt and comely.</hi> And in the 17. page, <hi>Although the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
ſorte through their dull witts &amp; their brutiſh education can not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
what is profitable for themſelues and good for their Countrey, yet
there be ſome others, whoſe thoughts and minds are inriched with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and vnderstanding, that haue done good in the country, and whoſe
example heerafter may giue light to many others. For I thinke that if
theſe people did once vnderstand the preciouſnes of vertue, they woulde
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16401:12"/>
farre exceede vs, notwithſtanding our long experience in the ſoueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of vertue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may ſee now, I haue no ſuch conceite againſt the <hi>Iriſh,</hi>
in generall as they haue fabled, but that I thinke there be good
amongſt the bad, and bad amongſt the good, I might therefore
haue reuoked this accuſation, as he that reuoked a long relying
letter but with one word <hi>Ment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

borrow a Lawyers plea, <hi>Non eſt factum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is yet againe obiected againſt me, that I haue vpbraided the
whole Iriſh nation with their rebellious diſpoſitions: with their
cruelties, with their murthers, with their treaſons, and that I doe
make ſemblance as though there were neuer a ſound ſubiect in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> neyther in life nor religion: if theſe reportes were but
halfe of them true, I might be aſhamed to drawe any breath in
<hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I would to God that neyther my ſelfe nor any other man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
could iuſtly reproue them for their rebellions, for then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections,
and for their treaſons and murthers both, but to
thinke that there is neuer a ſound ſubiect in</hi> Ireland, <hi>it were pittie
I ſhould liue to haue ſuch a thought in</hi> Ireland, <hi>but let mee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
as I haue begun, let mine owne lines pleade mine own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
in the 52. page, I haue ſet downe theſe wordes.</hi> I know there
bee in Ireland a number of worthy ſubiects, that cannot be detected, nor
their fidelitie and truſt to their Prince by any meanes impeached, <hi>And
in the 111. page,</hi> I know amongſt the Nobilitie of Ireland, there hath
beene, and there are ſtill, many honorable perſonages, and ſo there are
of many other gentlemen, that without all doubt are as foreward, as ready
and as willing to ſerue their Prince, as any other whoſoeuer. <hi>And yet
againe in the 54. page of my booke,</hi> I haue often ſayd, that there be
many good people in Dubline, and ſo through all the partes of Ireland be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
men of all ſortes, of all profeſſions, and of all degrees that are not to
bee detected.</p>
               <p>What haue I omitted to commend in the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> (I meane of
thoſe that are worthy of any comendations indeede) but I haue
done them right, I haue giuen them their due, I haue not forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
thoſe that be feweſt in number that are godly affected to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
as in the page, 91. <hi>God be thanked Ireland was neuer ſo desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
but there hath beene a number of good people natiues of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb facs="tcp:16401:13"/>
that hath zealouſly and religiouſly profeſſed the Goſpell.</hi> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thoſe that could ſpie out the diſcomme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dations I haue giuen
of thoſe that be bad, and could not ſee the prayſes I haue giuen
to thoſe that be good, it ſhould ſeeme they are not perfect ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but I would I could intreate them yet to put on their ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
and to looke into diuers parts of my booke that doe pleade
my excuſe, they ſhould find in the 14. page, this honeſt proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<hi>I doe know neuer a man in Ireland that I doe hate, or that I do
wiſh any harme vnto, and therefore if I happen to glance at the abuſes of
thoſe that be all, let not thoſe that be good thinke themſelues thereby to
be detected, or ſo much as touched.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They ſhould find againe in my Epiſtle to the Reader:</hi> I would
not haue it thought, that I make any difference betweene the <hi>Engliſh</hi> &amp;
the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> in reſpect of their birth, for I know there be as worthy men in
Ireland, as in England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in the laſt leafe of the booke againe, for a farwell:</hi> I hope
there is no man that will accuſe me of partiallity, to ſay I haue more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
to ſpeake againſt the follies of the Engliſh, then againſt the manners
and cuſtomes of the Iriſh, or that I doe otherwiſe distinguiſh betweene
them, but value them both a like, the good to the good, and the bad to the
bad.</p>
               <p>I knowe not yet therefore what <hi>Reuocation</hi> I ſhould make, but
to ſay that eyther I haue beene wonderfully miſtaken or ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
belied. I might yet ſpeake of other accuſations, that haue
beene greiuouſly inforced againſt mee, howe I haue mocked at
their <hi>Iriſh</hi> cuſtomes, ſcoffed at their holy welles, derided their
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Saints, and one in ſober ſadnes tooke it very greiuously that
I had termed, their Fryers their Ieſuites &amp; their Prieſts to be the
Popes vermine.</p>
               <p>I warrant ye, they that could ſpie me out theſe faultes, they were
not blinde they were none of theſe heritickes, that will ſay the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
noſter in <hi>Engliſh:</hi> but they ſay open confeſſion muſt haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
ſhame <hi>Peccaui.</hi> I haue ſinned, and here I doe make open <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation</hi>
for I reuoke welles Saints Fryers, Ieſuites, Prieſts, Pope,
Deuill and all: And I would all that knowes me in <hi>Ireland</hi> would
take example by me and do the like.</p>
               <p>Thus much for <hi>Ireland</hi> in generall that they ſay I haue ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
in my booke, &amp; now for <hi>Dubline</hi> in particuler that I hope
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16401:13"/>
I ſhall aſwell ſatiſfie and giue content.</p>
               <p>I haue written 3 ſeuerall Chapters the 15. the 16. and the 17.
that doe particularly concerne the Cytty of <hi>Dubline,</hi> the heade
of the 15. chap, <hi>A true deſcription both of the Cytty</hi> and <hi>Cittyzens</hi>
of <hi>Dubline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The head of the 16. <hi>Of ſome defectes in the gouernment of Dublin,</hi>
the head of the 17. <hi>Of the trade and trafficke that is vſed in Dublin,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt of the three, which is the 15. Chap. I haue a little
croſſed Maiſter <hi>Stanihurſt</hi> that in his deſcription of the Citty of
<hi>Dublin,</hi> doth ſo floriſh it out with ſuch gorgious buildings (as he
termeth them) that the world doth knowe, when hee writte his
Cronicle, made but a ſorry ſhowe, to what it is now. But <hi>Stani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurst</hi>
ſought to pleaſe by flattery, and I by plaine dealing, he
paintes it out more gorgiouſly then truely, but my deſcription in
theſe wordes following. <hi>To ſpeake the truth of Dublin as it deſerueth
first the Towne it ſelfe, is conuenient enough, pleaſantly ſeated aſwell for
the ſerenity of the ayre, as for the pleaſing walkes, that are rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about the
Citty on euery ſide:</hi> And this commendation, I thinke bee more
properly true, then that ſumptuous deſcription that Maiſter <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihurst</hi>
hath made of it. Now how I am conceited towardes the
Cittizens themſelues let mine owne lines witnes: which doth like
wiſe follow in theſe wordes. <hi>The Cittizens themſelues are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
reformed, in manners, in ciuilitie, in curteſie, both themſelues and
their wiues, modeſt and decent in their apparell, and they are tractable
enough in any thing, Religion onely excepted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the very latter words in the ſelfe ſame Chapter are theſe:</hi>
Dubline is not yet ſo deſtitute, but that there are ſome, aſwell learned
Diuines, as other graue and godly Cittizens and Townes-men that God
hath bleſſed with the light of his word, that doe dayly indeuoure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to giue good example, ſeeking no leſſe to aduance the glory of God,
as the honour of their Prince, and the good of their Country.</p>
               <p>Mee thinkes theſe words were enough for thoſe that were wiſe
to number themſelues amongſt thoſe that bee good, and not to
finde fault with the reprehenſions of thoſe that bee ill.</p>
               <p>But heere is a matter now obiected againſt mee, that in this
Chapter I haue taxed the Cittizens of lacke of loue to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie,
for their receiuing and harbouring of the Popes vermine,
which (they ſay) lies not in the Maior to redreſſe, but it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<pb facs="tcp:16401:14"/>
to a more ſuperiour authority, I proteſt I am ſorry that ther
ſhould be a man found in <hi>Dubline,</hi> that would take exceptions at
this, and theſe thinges were better to be buried with ſilence, then
to bee diſcourſed with diligence, but if it bee a fault to ſpeake
againſt the entertaining of popiſh prieſts in <hi>Dubline,</hi> that are wel
knowne to be his Maieſties proteſted enemies, I haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that fault through ignorance: for I had thought, that the
Cittizens of <hi>Dubline</hi> in generall, that haue receiued ſo many li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall
giftes, ſuch gracious grants, and large liberties, from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
and ſundry Princes of <hi>England,</hi> and that are ſo bountifully
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed, by our moſt gracious King that now is, I had thought
the Cittizens of <hi>Dubline,</hi> in reſpect of their loue and duty to ſo
good and gracious a King ſhoulde at the leaſt haue reſtrayned
(though not puniſhed) that brood of vipers, that doth practiſe
nothing but treaſon and contempt, both againſt his Maieſtie &amp;
his proceedinges.</p>
               <p>And I perſwaded my ſelfe againe, that the Mayor of <hi>Dubline</hi>
that is ſo great a magiſtrate within his owne precinct, that hath
the managing of all affayres within the Citty and that ſtandeth
vpon his prerogatiue within his liberties, and will haue no more
to medle but himſelfe, that may hang, that may draw, that may
puniſh, and hath his Maieſties ſword committed vnto him for
the ſame purpoſe, if all this be not ſufficient warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior
of <hi>Dubline,</hi> to hunt out of his iuriſdictions, thoſe ſowers of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
thoſe peruerters of his Maieſties good ſubiectes and thoſe
malitious enemies to their king, it is pitty that he hath not a new
Charter, wherein theſe ſeruices might be better warranted vnto
him: I doe not ſpeake of the Mayor that is now of the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
but I ſpeake of all that are paſt, and of the reſt that are to
come: for if euery Mayor within his liberties, and euery Biſhop
within his dioceſſe throughout <hi>Ireland,</hi> would doe their duties,
God would be more honoured, the King better obeyed, and the
people vnited in that loue and amitie, that now is diſſipated, by
this contrarietie in Religion. In the 16. chap. ſpeaking of ſome
defects in the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of <hi>Dublin,</hi> the greateſt fault that is ther
armed at, is the prophanatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Sabboth day, that day which
God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to bee kept holy, &amp; ſhould be dedicated to
his honor, that day is moſt polluted in <hi>Dublin,</hi> &amp; euery alehouſe
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> morning till night is peſtered, with drunkards with blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16401:14"/>
I will not ſpeake of whore-hunters, but indeede with all
kinde of diſordered people.</p>
               <p>It is truth, that in <hi>England</hi> (and elſe where that I know in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome)
there are drunkards, there are blaſphemers, &amp; there
are whore-hunters too many, but the rate penal lawes to reſtrain
them, but eſpecially on the Sabboth day, and in <hi>England,</hi> there
is not any one permitted to keepe a tippling houſe, but hee
muſt from yeere to yeere enter into bond, and good ſureties
with him, to keepe good rule and order: and I thinke there is no
man that profeſſeth to bee a Chriſtian, be he Proteſtant or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,
that will thinke I haue offended in this, and therefore I ſhal
not neede to make any <hi>Reuocation</hi> in the matter, becauſe I hope
there is no man agreiued at it. I would be ſorry to reitterate the
occaſion that bred offence, betweene the two Sheriues and my
ſelfe: becauſe my deſire is rather to qualifie, then to reuiue mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of vnkindnes, but what ſoeuer hath formerly paſt betweene
vs, I proteſt I am ſo free from malice towardes them, that I doe
not know them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other men, when I meete them in the ſtreets,
what meaning they haue towardes mee, I know not, if it be good
I would be glad, if it be ill, I care not: the worſt I doe wiſhe vnto
them, is, that it would pleaſe God to inſpire them with his ſpirite
of truth, and as I wiſh it from my heart, ſo helpe me God.</p>
               <p>And although I muſt confeſſe, I haue euer hated Popery, yet
I proteſt I neuer hated papiſt for his religion, but pitted him, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
he or they that I know to be ignorantly led, and ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by others, for I hate not the man, though I hate his religion.</p>
               <p>And let me now craue pardon of the Cittizens of <hi>Dubline</hi> in
generall, but to lament that calamity pittifull to bee ſpoken of,
that in the Citty of <hi>Dubline,</hi> where the word of God hath beene
ſo plentifully preached in ſuch continuance: &amp; that ſhould giue
light &amp; example to all the reſt, both of citties and towns through
out all <hi>Ireland:</hi> and are not able to make a yearely choyce of a
Mayor and two Sheriues, that will either goe to Church, or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
take the oath of alleadgeance to his Maieſty, &amp; that they
haue no other to imploy for his Maieſties ſeruice, but ſuch as
will impugne his Maieſties lawes.</p>
               <p>But they will ſay a Papiſt may bee a ſound ſubiect, I will
not denie but hee may bee ſo: but I will aske our Papiſtes of
<pb facs="tcp:16401:15"/>
                  <hi>Dubline</hi> or elſe where, but this queſtion, what they doe thinke,
whither at <hi>Rome</hi> or at <hi>Remes,</hi> or where ſoeuer otherwiſe, where po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popery
beareth ſway, whither they would put a knowne prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
in comiſſion for the ſeruice of the Pope: they would ſooner
put out both his eyes and carry him to a ſtake: but what a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
King is this, that ſeeketh but an oath for his ſecuritie: And of
whom? marry of thoſe that haue ſuch cunning to equiuocate and
haue ſo many diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in a readines, that what they ſweare to
day they may reuoke to morrow &amp; y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> are taught by their prieſts,
that when they are brought before ſuch as they account for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
they may both ſophiſtically ſweare &amp; ſophiſtically anſwere</p>
               <p>This I hope may ſuffice for a <hi>Reuocation</hi> of all ouerſightes that I
haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mited againſt the <hi>Cittizens</hi> of <hi>Dublin</hi> in the 16. Chap. of
my booke. And now to ſpeake ſomthing for the credit of that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
&amp; to deliuer truely but what I haue receiued from ſome of the
Cittizens themſelues, &amp; not of the inferiour ſort, but from ſome
of the beſt <hi>Aldermen</hi> of the citty of <hi>Dubline,</hi> who foreſeeing the
partialitie that is vſed by officers of all ſortes (that bee papiſtes)
that doe execute there places not only to the great detriment of
his Maieſties ſeruice but alſo when any of his Maieſties beſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
ſubiectes, that are knowne to be religious, &amp; haue confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
themſelues to his Maieſties proceedings, if any of theſe ſhal
light into the laps either of a Sergeant, a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtable or a Iayler that
is a papiſt, he ſhall bee afflicted and exacted on with more rigour
&amp; cruelty then if hee were amongſt Turkes or Iewes, where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
wiſe, if a papiſt be brought in queſtion although it be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for his diſobedience towardes his Prince there is ſcarce an
officer that wil do his duty to aprehend him, or being aprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
there will hardly befound a Iayler that will ſcantle him with any
ſhort alowance belonging to an offender, but will rather enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
him as a friend, And the more repugnant he ſheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
againſt his Maieſties proceedings, ſo much the more fauour
the Iayler will ſhewe him. Theſe officers that I ſpeake of be ſuch
as are belonging to cities and townes corporat, yea to the citty of
<hi>Dubline</hi> it ſelfe, amongſt the which there are ſome that on ſunday

the Maior to Chriſtchurch, &amp; hauing put him into his pue, they

the inhabitantes whereof, although there be ſome few that be ill,
yet I know there be a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of moſt worthy citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that do
ſhew no leſſe zeale and feruency in the worſhipping of <hi>God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> then
loue and loyaltie to the ſeruice of the king, who for the better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement
of thoſe affaires that doe belong to his maieſtie, do
wiſh and deſire, that not onely the Mayor and Sheryues in euery
Citie and towne corporate, throughout the Realme of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
ſhould receiue the oath of alleageance, but that there ſhould not
be a Sergeant, a Conſtable, a Iayler, or any other pettie officer
admited, but ſuch as are tractable to his maieſties proceedings &amp;
ſubmiſſiue to take vppon them, the oath of obedience.</p>
               <p>But ſome perhaps will ſay, that the Citties in <hi>Ireland</hi> (no not
<hi>Dublyne</hi> it ſelfe) is able yeare after yeare, to make choiſe of a <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>or</hi>
and two Sheryues, that will willingly take the oath of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to his maieſtie, the which if it ſhould bee true, (as God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
it ſhoulde ſo bee) what a gratious clemencie then in a prince,
that will ſuffer a people to inioy ſo large liberties, as euery Cittie
throughout that realme is commonly infranchized, that are ſo
repugnant, and oppoſite vnto him.</p>
               <p>To come now to the 17. ſpeaking <hi>Of the trade and trafficke that
is vſed in Dublyne:</hi> ſome of them doe exclaime againſt me, that I
haue wonderfully wronged the cittie in ſpeaking againſt their
multitude of Alehouſes, which they call <hi>Tauerns;</hi> but as good
lucke woulde haue it, there bee others beſide my ſelfe that haue
founde out that fault, and firſt a moſt reuerent and worthie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
the Lord chiefe <hi>Barrone</hi> of his maieſties Exchequer in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> who in his oration to the late Mayor of <hi>Dublyne,</hi> when
he came to take his oath at the Chequer barre, gaue him aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements,
of that ſuperabundance of <hi>Alehouſes,</hi> and of the abuſes
and inconueniences that did grow by the ſufferance of them.</p>
               <p>There was a learned doctor likewiſe, that openly exclaimed at
the abhomination that was vſed in thoſe multitude of <hi>Alehouſes,</hi>
in a Sermon at <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> before the Lord Deputy and the
ſtate, and before maiſter Mayor himſelfe, and thoſe fewe of his
brethren, that doe vſe to come to Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:16401:16"/>
But if it be a fault in me more then in the reſt to ſpeake againſt
theſe things, let it paſſe for one of my ouerſights, for I ſee he that
ſpeakes againſt pride drunkenneſſe and lechery, ſhall want no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
               <p>There followeth now a grieuous quarrell, and aboue all the
reſt moſt bitterly agrauated againſt me, and there hath beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie
made in the matter whither I haue belyed the Citie or no
in ſaying, the Aldermens wiues ſould ale: my wordes are, <hi>The
beſt ſort of women, as Aldermens wiues and the reſt of the able ſort, are
thoſe that doe brewe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let it be vnderſtood (as without diſſimulation I ment it)
that ſome Aldermens wiues did brew ale to the intent to ſell it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
by the doſins, by the barrell, or by the great (as we call it)
is this ſuch an indignity to all to ſay that ſome haue done ſo: or
what diſcredite to her that ſhoulde ſo doe, any more to brew ale,
then to make malte, or to indeuour any other thinges, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longes
to good huſwifery, that euery wiſe womanne is to vnder
take.</p>
               <p>It is not the brewing of ale, but the number of idle huſwiues,
that vnder the pretence of ſelling, do keepe filthy houſes, ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to be ſpoken of, this is it that offendeth.</p>
               <p>But I can tell where this and worſe matter too, was agravated
agaynſt me to ſome Aldermens wiues, by a femall creature, and
by ſuch a one (I warrant you) that doth thinke her ſelfe to be in
as good requeſt as <hi>Pudding Tabacco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let me ſay for mine owne excuſe, for the Aldermen of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyne</hi>
themſelues, there be many of them my good friends, whom
I dearely loue, there is not any one of them that I thinke to bee
my foe, or that I doe hate, and therefore to ſlander them with
matter of vntruth, I would be ill aſhamed.</p>
               <p>Now for their wiues in generall, and for all the reſt of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
wiues of <hi>Dublyne</hi> (that be of the better ſort) I proteſt it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently,
and I ſpeake it from my heart, I neuer heard women les
infamed or miſſe-reported, in any citty or towne whereſoeuer I
haue trauayled: ſo that if <hi>Thucidides</hi> rule be true, that thoſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are to be accounted moſt honeſt, that are leaſt ſpoken of, I
ſay the citizens wyues of <hi>Dublyne,</hi> may march in equall ranke
with thoſe women that are leaſt ſteyned or miſreputed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:16401:16"/>
In a fewe wordes now to expreſſe mine owne meaning, firſt
for this conſtruction that is made againſt me about the brewing
of ale: I doe confeſſe of mine owne knowledge, that there bee
diuerſe Aldermens wyues, and many other women beeſides that
neuer vſed it: but if they hadd, it is not the brewing of Ale that
I find fault with, nor with the ſelling of it, by thoſe women that
are honeſt, but by thoſe that are well knowne to be ſhameful li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
it is agaynſt them and againſt no other, that I do exclaime.</p>
               <p>I doe acknowledge likewiſe that Alehouſes, and victuallyng
houſes be both of them neceſſary, and therfore howſoeuer they
interpret my words, thoſe that be wiſe, can conceiue of my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
theſe typling houſes by honeſt houſholders, and not by
theſe knowne ſtrumpets, that vnder the colour of ſelling ale,
doe liue in that loathſomneſſe of life, too ſhamefull to bee ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of.</p>
               <p>There is yet one other vnkindneſſe conceiued agaynſt me, for
ſpeaking of the extortion that is vſed by the Bakers of <hi>Dublyne,</hi>
that will bee ſure to make their breade after double the rate, that
corne is ſould for: a matter eſpecially looked into in euery Citty
and towne. And as it appeareth in the <hi>Engliſhe Cronicle,</hi> the liber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>London,</hi> haue beene ceaſed into the handes of the king for
this tollerating, with the inormity of Bakers, and it hath euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
beene thought a matter moſt behouefull to puniſh (and
that with all extremity) this extortion in Bakers, becauſe it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pincheth the poorer ſorte, that are worſt able to beare it.</p>
               <p>I proteſt I cannot revoke this as an ouerſight, that I haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
agaynſt the <hi>Bakers,</hi> but doe rather inforce it, that eyther
they ſhould be reformed or elſe that the country <hi>Bakers,</hi> that wil
make their bread according to a true aſſiſe might be ſuffered (as
they be in other wel gouerned Cities) to ſerue the market, which
euery man doth admire, is not ſuffered in <hi>Dublyne:</hi> And now to
ſpeake without diſſimulation, there is nothing wherewith the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Dublyne</hi> is more wounded with diſgrace, then in ſufferyng
ſo many filthie alehouſes, and in this bearing with the extortion
of <hi>Bakers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you may ſee that although I haue gla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced at abuſes that
are vſed by ſome that are ill, yet it is without any impeachment
of thoſe that be good, and therefore thoſe fault-finders haue but
<pb facs="tcp:16401:17"/>
diſcouered their malice, and done me no diſgrace.</p>
               <p>The truth is, the wholl drift of my Booke is againſt Popery,
how ſhould it then be befrie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where thoſe that wil be
afraid to reade it, will make no conſcience at all to ſlander it.</p>
               <p>I know not whither I may tearme it to be blindneſſe or obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie,
or blindnes and obſtinacie ioyned both together, in a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
(ſencible and wiſe enough) that yet are trayned to neglect
the holy ſcriptures, to reuerence viſions lyes and fantazies: that
are led from the Church of God, to the ſuperſtitious, and abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
Church of Idolatry: that are wreſted from the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Princes wholſome lawes, that inciteth to vnitie and
concorde, to the durtie decrees and ordinances of a ſuperſtitious
prieſt, that leadeth to deſtruction: that doth ſo neglect the means
of their ſaluation: that they will not ſearch for the truth, but are
ſo maliciouſly blinde, that they will not open their eyes to looke
towardes the light: that with the <hi>Iewes</hi> do throw ſtones at <hi>Chriſt</hi>
and will driue him away, when he commeth to preach, that with
the <hi>Nazarits,</hi> will thruſt him out of their citie with violent hands
when he commeth to offer himſelfe vnto them.</p>
               <p>I know not what I ſhould ſay of the people of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whither
it be through the confidence they haue in their prieſtes, or in the
diſtruſt that they haue of their owne iudgementes, or in the litle
credite they haue in <hi>Gods</hi> promiſes, that biddeth them ſeeke and
they ſhall finde: but ſomething there is that maketh them afraid
for they dare not looke on a booke, that is either repugnant to
their religion, or that doth contradict Popery.</p>
               <p>I haue not ſpoken theſe thinges againſt the <hi>Iriſhe,</hi> tauntingly,
to vpbraide them, but I ſpeake it louingly to admoniſh them: &amp;
as the preacher that ſeeing ſome of his pariſhioners to frequent
his Sermons, more for faſhion ſake, and to take a little nappe of
ſleepe in the time of his ſermon, then for any zeale or deuotion
to the doctrine hee taught, yet hee wiſhed them ſtill to come to
Church although but to take their accuſtomed nap, hoping in
time to take ſome of them napping, and ſo to awaken them with
the power of <hi>Gods</hi> worde, to make them more attentiue to thoſe
thinges that did ſo nearely concerne their ſaluation: euen ſo ſay
I, let thoſe that haue read ouer my former booke, but to the end

I care not with what pretence, let them be angry ſtill at mine

there is nothing more dangerous then to wander with curious
ſpeculation, to ſearch out God, for as God in his owne nature
is vnmeaſurable, incomprehenſible, and infinite, ſo he is to mans

               <p>Let him then that would bee in ſafety and out of perill, brydle

               <p>Then hee that hath to deale in the matter of his iuſtification,

the ſonne of <hi>God</hi> muſt needes be giuen for it, &amp; would yet thinke
of any other ſatisfaction, whereby we might redeeme our ſelues

               <p>Wee might heere againe yet further conſider, that ſinne is a
mightie tyrant, that is not to be vanquiſhed by the power of any
creature, but by the infinite power of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> the ſon of <hi>God</hi>
that gaue himſelfe for it.</p>
               <p>Then what doe the papiſtes, that doe thinke to ouercome ſin,
by their owne workes and merites, but in eſtabliſhing their own

and moſt perniciouſly doe ſet at naught, the precious bloude of

               <p>But our Papiſtes I thinke, are vtterly ignorant of the grieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes
of ſinne, &amp; do dreame it to be of no great force nor power
but that it may eaſily be put away, by good workes, by a popes

               <p>Then they make certayne diſtinctions, between ſinne &amp; ſinne

from their anchor holde: to them on the other ſide, that hee in
ſnareth, to truſt in their own works and merites, them he lulleth
aſleepe in ſecuritie, they make ſinne no ſinne, they thinke to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre
it, but in going to a Saints ſhryne, in ſetting vp a holy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
or in forbearing to eate egges on Friday.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more contrary to the nature of fleſh &amp; bloud
then to be reprooued in thoſe thinges, wherein they think them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues
to deſerue greateſt prayſe, to ſay they be ſinners, vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
wicked, the children of wrath, when they thinke they haue
made themſelues righte us and holy by their good workes, by
going on pylgrymage, by praying to Saints.</p>
               <p>The wiſedome and righteouſneſſe of the fleſh is growne ſo
proud and ſtately, that they cannot indure to heare of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
of grace and faith: but that righteouſneſſe, which
knoweth not the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, is double ſinne: and
therefore theſe holy ſinnes that are committed, bearing the ſhew
of righteouſneſſe, are farre more daungerous then thoſe fleſhly
ſinnes indeede, that all the world doth acknowledge to be mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous,
and the more wiſe, righteous and holy, menn are without
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo much the more hurt they doe to the goſpell.</p>
               <p>If wee ſhoulde compare blaſphemers, publicans and harlots,
to thoſe holy hypocrites, we ſhould finde them the more likely
to obteyne grace, for they when they offende haue remorſe of
conſcience and doe not iuſtifie their wicked doinges, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dare affirme their idolatries, their wicked worſhippinges, &amp;
their other abhominations, to bee the workes of righteouſneſſe
acceptable vnto <hi>God,</hi> and thinges auaileable to ſaluation.</p>
               <p>So long therefore, as the opinion of righteouſneſſe abideth in
men, ſo long there is alſo abiding incomprehenſible pride, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
ſecuritie, contempt of the grace and mercy that is pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſed
in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The doctrine of the goſpell taketh from men, all glory, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
righteouſneſſe, and giueth them to God alone, to whome
<pb facs="tcp:16401:20"/>
they belong, the goſpell is a doctrine, concerning Chriſt, which
is neyther law nor worke, but our righteouſnes, ſanctification &amp;
redemption, <hi>That he might be made an oblation for the ſinnes of the
whole world, that our ſinnes might be forgiuen for his ſake, and not for
the workes of the law, nor our owne righteouſneſſe:</hi> we acknowledge
and confeſſe that there is nothing in vs that is able to deſerue
grace and the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes: but that at wee obteyne it by
the free mercy of God, onely for <hi>Chriſtes</hi> ſake, whereby we doe
not ſeeke to ſet forth mans worthineſſe, but Gods mercy offered
vnto vs in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For Chriſt and the Law cannot agree together in the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
the one muſt giue place: and he that cannot beeleeue that
God will forgiue him his ſinnes, for Chriſtes ſake, how can he be
leeue that his ſinnes ſhall be forgiuen, for the workes of the law,
which no man yet was euer able to performe.</p>
               <p>They that doe mingle the law, and the goſpell together, doe
perueit both, for either <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt remayne and the lawe giue
place or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the law muſt remayne, and Chriſt muſt giue place.</p>
               <p>For he that will needes couple the law with the goſpell, doth
not onely blemiſh and darken the knowledge of grace, which
<hi>Paul</hi> ſo often ſpeaketh of, but alſo he taketh away Chriſt with al
his benefites.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The law indeed was giuen to vtter ſinne, death and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whereby to driue vs to Chriſt.</hi> The Law is our ſchoolmaſter to
bring vs to Chriſt <hi>ſaith the</hi> Apoſtle <hi>Gala. 3. and our Sauiour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
in the ſixt of</hi> Iohn: Do not thinke that I will accuſe you to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
there is another that accuſeth you, euen Moſes in whome you
truſt.</p>
               <p>One place of Scripture conteyning ſome threatening of the
law, beateth downe all conſolations beſides, and ſo ſhaketh all
our inward powers, that it maketh vs to forget iuſtification, grace
the goſpell and Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The law no doubt is holy, righteous and good, &amp; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the workes of the law are holy righteous and good, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
a man is not therby iuſtified before God, but made
the rather ſubiect to the curſe.</p>
               <p>And although there be nothing more neceſſary then the lawe
and the workes thereof, yet by the ſame a man may be brought
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16401:20"/>
to the deniall of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for of the lawe many times commeth a
truſt and affiance in workes, and where that is, there can bee no
affiance in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> the righteouſneſſe of the lawe is to fulfill the
law according to this ſaying of the <hi>Apoſtle, He that ſhall doe theſe
thinges ſhall liue in them,</hi> but the righteouſneſſe of ſayth is to bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
according to this ſaying: <hi>The righteous manne dooth lyue by
fayth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Papiſtes that doe ſo much indeuour to eſtabliſh the
righteouſneſſe of workes, doe thereby tread downe the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
of Chriſt, for although it be true, that workes muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
faith, yet in the worke of our ſaluation, there muſt bee no
medly, we muſt relye in the one or in the other: now faith work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not but beleeueth in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is our propytion, and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſinnes, but the effect of the law is not to make righteous
and to giue life, but to ſhewe forth ſinne, and to deſtroy, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the lawe ſayeth, <hi>Hee that ſhall doe theſe thinges ſhall liue in
them,</hi> yet I would but ſee a Papiſt, that could poynt me out but
one man, that had ſo performed the workes of the law, to merite
eternall life by his owne deſeruings: who ſo euer ſeeketh to make
himſelfe holy by the lawe, what canne he imagine, but that <hi>God</hi>
beeing angry, muſt needes be pacified with good works, &amp; what
workes can he now performe wherin he findeth not ſome imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
his faſting, his praying, his worſhipping, his ſacrificing
he thinketh ſtill that he hath omitted ſomewhat, or that he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h
not done them as hee ought, they cannot therefore quiet his
conſcience.</p>
               <p>If our reward ſhould be according to our workes, there ſhould
no man be ſaued, when our beſt deedes (compared to the law)
are damnable ſinnes, neither by it is any fleſh iuſtified as it appea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth
in the 3. to the <hi>Rom.</hi> for the fulfilling of the law, is onely to
beleeue in Chriſt: neyther is it written in the goſpell, hee that
worketh, but he that beleeueth ſhall be ſaued, and therfore they
that doe ſeeke heauen by works, are ſuch as doe not vnderſtand
the treaſures that are layd vp for them in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There is no man ſo fooliſh to condemne good workes (as the
Papiſt moſt ſlaunderouſly reporteth) but wee condemne confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in good workes, that ſhould eyther iuſtifie or make righte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ous
whereby the precious bloud of Chriſt ſhould be made alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb facs="tcp:16401:21"/>
vnprofitable, for thoſe that doe ſeeke their iuſtification
by Lawe, or workes, what is it elſe but a flat deniall of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But here commeth reaſon now to debate the matter, who hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring
of iuſtification by fayth, beginneth to ſtorme: what ſayth it
are all my good workes then nothing worth? haue I faſted, haue
I prayed, haue I bin charitable in beſtowing my money to build
chappels to builde chanteryes, to giue perpetuities to maſſing
prieſtes, to buy Coopes, veſtments, Croſſes, and chalyces, &amp;
are all theſe nothing worth, haue I laboured in vaine?</p>
               <p>In any caſe therefore when wee come to debate of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
away with reaſon, which is an vtter enemie to fayth, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
not to the righteouſneſſe of fayth, but to it owne righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
or at the leaſt to the righteouſneſſe of the lawe: now wher
Law and reaſon are once linkt together, there fayth looſeth her
virginitie: for mans reaſon taketh more pleaſure in meaſuring
of God, by her owne imagination, then by his worde, and doth
thoſe with better will and greater zeale, that ſhee her ſelfe hath
choſen, then thoſe that <hi>God</hi> hath commaunded.</p>
               <p>And therefore if with the papiſt, we ſhould goe about to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
the thinges appertaining to fayth and ſaluation, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the rule of reaſon, wee ſhould finde both great abſurditie
and many impoſſibilities: for who can beleeue the articles of the
Chriſtian fayth, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> the ſonne of <hi>God</hi> was conceiued, and
borne in the wombe of the virgine Mary, that he was borne and
ſuffered, the moſt reprochfull death of the Croſſe: that the dead
ſhall riſe at the laſt day? and howe abſurde and fooliſh dooth it
ſeeme to reaſon, that in the Lordes Supper, the body &amp; bloude
of Chriſt, ſhould ſpiritually be offered vnto vs, or that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of baptiſme ſhould be the receiuing of the holy Ghoſt:
or if we had no better ſpeculation then to looke with the eyes of
reaſon how could we ſee or beleeue the bleſſed trinitie? but how
fooliſh and impoſſible did it ſeeme in the iudgement of reaſon,
when <hi>God</hi> ſayde vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> that he ſhould haue a ſon of the
withered and barren body of his wife <hi>Sara?</hi> we may therfore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
and that vndoubtedly, that in the ſearching out of thinges
that are diuine, there is nothing more vnreaſonable, then that
which we call naturall reaſon: <hi>The wiſedome of the fleſh</hi> (ſaith Saint
<hi>Paule) is enmitie with God:</hi> And therefore when <hi>God</hi> ſpeaketh,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16401:21"/>
reaſon iudgeth his words to be hereſie.</p>
               <p>The papiſt doth attribute the merit of grace, and the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſinnes, to the worke wrought, for they ſay that a good worke
before grace is auaileable to obteyne grace of congruence, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is meete and conuenient that GOD ſhoulde rewarde
ſuch a worke, but when grace by this meanes is once obteyned,
then the good workes following doe deſerue euerlaſting life as a
due debt.</p>
               <p>For the firſt worke before grace <hi>God</hi> is no debter, but beecauſe
he is iuſt and good, it therefore behoueth him to approue ſuch a
worke, and to giue grace for ſuch a piece of ſeruice: but when
grace is obtayned, <hi>God</hi> is become a debtor, and is conſtreyned
of right and dutie to giue eternall life: for now it is a worke don
in grace and therefore it maketh gratious.</p>
               <p>Now if a man, of his own abilitie may performe a worke which
is not onely acceptable in <hi>Gods</hi> ſight, but is alſo able to deſerue
grace of congruence, &amp; get of right and duty eternall life, what
neede is there then of the grace of <hi>God,</hi> of the forgiuenes of ſins
or of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe? he might well haue ſpared his bloude and
bitter paſſion: we are able to craue for our ſelues, and to worke
our owne ſaluation by our owne deſeruinges.</p>
               <p>But if the Pope, with all his religious rable were not both blind
and malicious, they could not chooſe but ſee, and would not let
to confeſſe it to bee a moſt horrible blaſphemy, to thinke that
there is any worke whereby to pacifie <hi>God,</hi> when wee ſee there is
nothing that could appeaſe him, but that ineſtimable price, euen
the death of his Sonne: away then with theſe Popiſh ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of workes, of merits, of vowes, of ceremonies, both before
grace &amp; after grace, throw them altogether with their firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
into the bottomeles pit of hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whatſoeuer is not of faith, is ſinne,</hi> ſayeth the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> Rom. 14.
and therefore he that would deſerue grace by workes going bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
faith, goeth about to pleaſe <hi>God</hi> with ſinnes by heaping one
vppon an other, and therefore thou canſt not deſerue grace by
thy workes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pelagians</hi> doe grant aſmuch of grace as the papiſtes do,
for they ſay that menne may haue a good purpoſe, and a loue
of grace, of their owne naturall ſtrength, for (ſay they) <hi>God</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:16401:22"/>
hath giuen good Lawes: and a manne may keepe them of his
owne naturall ſtrength, or elſe the commandements were giuen
in vayne.</p>
               <p>And may not infidelles and miſbeleeuers attayne to this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of congruence? for the Papiſtes doe grant that it commeth
of naturall ſtrength, and yet it ſhould not follow of congruence
that they ſhall receiue grace, nor yet attayne to the remiſſion
of ſinnes, for howe ſhould a man without a ſpeciall grace abhor
his ſinnes: for if men may doe good before grace, then we may
gather grapes of thornes, and figges of thiſtles: we ſee now, that
the firſt parte of Chriſtianitie dooth conſiſt in the knowledge of
our ſelues, and of our owne vnworthineſſe.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde part (if thou wilt be ſaued) thou muſt not ſeeke
thy ſaluation in thy workes, but in Chriſt that was crucified and
dyed for thee, for <hi>God</hi> hath reuealed vnto vs, that hee will bee
vnto vs, a mercifull father, and without our deſertes (ſeeing
wee are able to deſerue nothing) will freely giue vnto vs remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſinnes, righteouſneſſe and life euerlaſting, for his ſonne
Chriſtes ſake.</p>
               <p>This is our beliefe touching Chriſtian righteouſneſſe, againſt
theſe horrible and monſtrous blaſphemies of papiſtes, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their merite of congruence, and worthines of works.</p>
               <p>Chriſtian righteouſneſſe is Chriſt apprehended by faith, and
dwelling in the hearte, but to giue a true rule of Chriſtianitie:
firſt wee are to conſider that a man muſt be taught by the Lawe
to know himſelfe, and to vnderſtande that <hi>all haue ſinned, and
haue need of the glory of God,</hi> Rom. 3 and that <hi>There is not one righte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ous,
no not one:</hi> Pſal. 14. when a man is thus humbled by the lawe,
and brought to the knowledge of himſelfe, then followeth true
re entance, and heere hee beeginneth to ſigh and to ſeeke out
for ſuccour, and vtterly diſpayring of his owne ſtrength, hee
findeth this comfortable conſolation: <hi>Sonne, thy ſinnes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen
thee: beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt, who hath taken thy ſinnes vppon him,
whoſe stripes haue made thee whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the beginning of health and ſaluation, by theſe means
we are deliuered from ſinne, iuſtified and made the inheritors of
life euerlaſting, not for our owne workes and deſerts, but for our
fayth whereby we lay hold vppon Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:16401:22"/>
When we haue thus laide hold vpon Chriſt by faith, through
whom we are made righteous, nowe followe good workes; and
that is, to loue <hi>God</hi> aboue all thinges, call vpon him, giue thanks
vnto him, prayſe his holy name, confeſſe his goodneſſe &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
towardes thee, beginne nowe to loue thy neighbour as thy
ſelfe, doe vnto him as thou wouldeſt bee done vnto, helpe the
needy, comfort the afflicted, giue almes to the poore.</p>
               <p>Theſe be good workes indeed, for this hearing of maſſes, this
worſhipping and offering to Idols, this going on pylgrymage,
to the holy Croſſe, to Saint <hi>Patrickes Purgatory,</hi> this giuing to
laſciuious prieſtes: leaue this to the Papiſtes, the generation of
<hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and the reſt of that holy rable of the Popes <hi>Vermine,</hi>
that dares take thoſe priuiledges to themſelues, that doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
belong vnto Chriſt alone, he onely forgiueth ſinnes, hee
onely giueth righteouſneſſe and euerlaſting life.</p>
               <p>Good workes are outwarde ſignes of true faith, which do not
iuſtifie of themſelues, but are as teſtimonialles to the worker,
that he is already iuſtified, ſo that workes are out the fruites of
fayth: good workes are all thinges that are done within the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites
of the lawes of <hi>God,</hi> in which <hi>God</hi> is honored, and for which
thankes are giuen to <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That faith that bringeth forth good workes doth iuſtifie, but
the works doe not iuſtifie, and this iuſtifying fayth is the free gift
of <hi>God</hi> without our deſeruinges, for by this faith giuen vs thus by
grace, we attayne the benefite of Chriſtes death, which onely iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth
vs, ſo that good workes are the fruites of a good faith.</p>
               <p>Faſting is a good worke, but howe? not to abſteyne, from
the eating of fleſhe, and to pamper the panch with all ſortes of
fiſh, till it be ready to ſurfeit, not to refraine from the eating of
an egge, and to make no conſcience at the killing of a man: not
to make difference of dayes, and to forbeare from butter, cheeſe
and milke, but neuer to abſteyne (neyther faſting day nor other)
to liue in drunkenneſſe in whordome, and in all manner of loath
ſome ſinne and wickednes: not to faſt in the honor of a Saynt,
and to liue with bread and water one day, &amp; the next day to glut
our ſelues, and to ryot and reuell it out with all exceſſe.</p>
               <p>And what are theſe prayers that are deliuered in a ſtrange
<pb facs="tcp:16401:23"/>
tongue, that are tallied vpon a payre of Beades, that are preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to Saintes, Images and Idoles, but the works of darknes,
of ſinne and of damnation?</p>
               <p>All ſuch religion where God is worſhipped without his word,
and commaundement, is idolatry, and the more holy it ſeemeth
in outward ſhowe, ſo much the more dangerous: this abſtinency
of the Papiſtes in forbearing of fleſh, and eating of fiſhe, their
praying vpon beades, their worſhipping of Saints, their vowes,
their pilgrimages are all Idolatry.</p>
               <p>We doe not reiect faſting, and other good exerciſes as things
vnneceſſary, but we ſay that by theſe exerciſes, wee doe not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
remiſſion of Sinnes: and heerevpon, the papiſtes both ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly
doe iudge, and ſlanderouſly doe reporte, that wee
ſpeake againſt good workes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether thou eate or not eate, thou art neyther better nor worſe</hi> ſaith
the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> now if any man would ſay, if thou eate, thou ſinneſt
or if thou abſtaine, thou art righteous, hee ſhould but ſhewe his
ignorance: it is a ſmall matter to eate or not to eate, but when a
man doth beleeue, that in abſtaining, hee meriteth heauen, or is
thereby the more holy, heere God is denied, and Chriſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected,
and the bleſſinges of God thereby abuſed, and to thinke
that life or ſaluation, or death, and damnation, dependeth in the
obſeruation heereof, is a deuilliſh ſuperſtition, and full of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</p>
               <p>It is truth the papiſtes doe faſt, they pray, they watch, they do
lay croſſes on them ſelues, but by this they thinke to appeaſe
the wrath of God, to deſerue grace, to worke their righteouſnes,
to make themſelues holy: by this, they take from God his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie,
his diuinity, his mercy: And doe attribute the worke of
their ſaluation, to their owne merites and deſeruings.</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour in the 6. of <hi>Mathew,</hi> reproued thoſe workes that
are not performed by faith: but what workes bee thoſe that hee
there rebuketh? euen ſuch as are commaunded by the ſcriptures,
and ſuch as euery true Chriſtian muſt put in practiſe, namely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting,
praying, &amp; deedes of almes: for the Scriptures themſelues
being once corrupted with gloſſes (as our papiſtes do accuſtome
and as they haue made manifeſt in their <hi>Remiſh Teſtament</hi>) is no
more Gods word: ſo thoſe thinges that are commaunded by the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16401:23"/>
Scriptures, being once peruerted, and alienated from their true
vſes are neyther to be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted for good workes or godly deeds:
now what are become of thoſe merits of congruence, before faith
when faſting, praying, and almes giuing are reprooued, Chriſte
heere deſtroyeth not faſting, praying, and almes deedes, but
hee preacheth againſt the purpoſe and intent, howe they were
peruerted, by the Scribes and Phariſees, ſo we that do ſeeke our
ſaluation in Chriſt onely, doe not ſeeke to deſtroy the deeds of
good workes (as the papiſtes vntruely doe report) but wee ſay
that thoſe that doe ſeeke their iuſtification in them (as the papiſt
doth teach) are moſt iniurious to the bloud of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Turkes and Iewes doe giue almes as plentifully as any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
doe, yet it is abhominable, for lacke of faith and knowledg
of the true intent.</p>
               <p>In the offeringes that were made by <hi>Abell</hi> and <hi>Caine,</hi> wee ſee
that though the workes that are performed by vngodly perſons,
doe make as glorious a ſhow, as the deedes of the godly, yet in
the ſight of God which looketh on the heart, the deede is good
becauſe of the man, and not the man becauſe of the deede.</p>
               <p>The wrath of God conſumeth theſe holy and faithles workes,
as it did <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu:</hi> And here if we did but turne our eies
vnto the Phariſees, which before the comming of Chriſt in his
fleſh, had layed the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of freewill, wheron they built their
holy workes: ſee what followed, vpon feruency and zeale, they
thruſt themſelues out of the holy reſt of forgiuenes of ſinnes, by
faith in the bloud of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Mee thinkes the Phariſees and our papiſtes doe drawe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one line, for the Phariſees perſecuted Chriſt, becauſe hee
reprooued their holy workes, and our papiſtes are as angry to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
vs, becauſe we renounce their ſuperſtitious merites, and
ſeeke our iuſtification in the bloode of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham beleeued God and it was imputed to him for righteouſnes</hi>
then <hi>Abraham</hi> obtained not this righteouſneſſe before God
through the workes of the lawe, for at that time there was no law
nor in foure hundred and odd yeares after, then if there were no
law, there could be neither worke nor merit, what then, but the
bare promiſe, which <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeued, and it was accounted to
him for righteouſnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:16401:24"/>
                  <hi>Abell</hi> and <hi>Caine, They offered their oblations vnto the Lord, but the
Lord had reſpect to the offering of Abell:</hi> you ſee now ſayth the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,
that God hath reſpect to offerings, and therefore works do
iuſtifie: but what blindnes is this that will not ſuffer them to ſee,
that God had firſt reſpect to the perſon of <hi>Abell,</hi> which pleaſed
the Lord, becauſe of his faith, their workes were both one, they
both offered oblations: what was then the difference? <hi>Abell</hi> was
faithfull, and <hi>Caine</hi> an hypocrite, preſuming on his owne merit,
as our Papiſtes doe.</p>
               <p>It is truth, faith and good workes are neere neighbours, for
they ſtill dwell together in a righteous man, but as touchinge
their office, there is a great ſeparation, for the lawe can haue no
dominion but ouer the fleſhe, and faith alone muſt dwell in the
conſcience, and ſending <hi>Moſes</hi> away with his lawe, there ſhee
planteth <hi>Chriſt</hi> with his righteouſnes: for the bleeuing conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
muſt know of no law.</p>
               <p>He that hath once receiued Chriſt by faith, and knoweth that
hee is his righteouſnes and life, doubtles he will not be idle, but
as a good tree he will bring foorth good fruite, for the beleeuing
man, hath the holy <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> and where the holy <hi>Ghoſt</hi> dwelleth it
will not ſuffer a man to be idle, but ſtirreth him vp to all exerciſes
of piety and godlines, and of true religion, to the loue of God, to
the patient ſuffering of afflictions, to prayer, to thankeſgiuing, &amp;
to the exerciſe of charity towards all men: but theſe good works
and this charity following faith, doe neither forme nor adorne
my faith, but my faith both formeth and adorneth them.</p>
               <p>Faith and workes therefore muſt be ſo taught, as the one hee
not confounded by the other, for he that teacheth works onely,
as the papiſtes are accuſtomed, then ſaith is loſt, if faith onely be
taught, then carnall men by and by begin to dreame, that workes
are not needefull.</p>
               <p>Faith is the beleeuing of Gods promiſes, and a ſure truſt and
confidence of goodnes and truth, and true faith is impoſſible to
be had without the ſpirit of God, for it is aboue all naturall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that a man in the time of affliction, when God ſcourgeth him
ſhould then beleeue, that God then loueth and prepareth for his
good.</p>
               <p>Faith giueth glory onely vnto God, which is the greateſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16401:24"/>
man can doe vnto him, for without faith God looſeth his
glory, his wiſedome, his righteouſneſſe, his truth and his mercy:
And to conclude, there is neyther Maieſtie, nor diuinity remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
vnto God, where faith is wanting.</p>
               <p>The papiſt will ſay, that we muſt beleeue in Chriſt, and that
faith is the foundation of our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but it iuſtifieth not except
it bee furniſhed with charity and good works: but faith of it ſelfe
is Gods gift, and Gods worke in our heartes, which therefore
iuſtifieth becauſe it apprehendeth Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Mans reaſon can not comprehend this, but thinketh of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and of workes, what I haue done, and what I haue not done,
but faith hath no other obiect then <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> the Son of God
deliuered to death for the ſinnes of the whole world, ſaith loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
neyther to charitie, nor to workes: it ſaith not what haue I
done, or what haue I deſerued, but what hath <hi>Chriſt</hi> done, what
hath hee deſerued: the goſpell then truely anſwereth, that hee
hath deliuered me from eternall death and damnation, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a true and a ſtedfaſt faith muſt lay hold vppon nothing elſe
but vpon Chriſt alone.</p>
               <p>When I can feele and confeſſe my ſelfe to be a ſinner through
<hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, without my deſeruings, why ſhoulde I not
thinke my ſelfe to bee made righteous againe, through the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
of Chriſt, without my deſeruinges?</p>
               <p>And therefore he that apprehendeth Chriſt truely by faith,
although he be neuer ſo much preſſed downe with the waight of
his ſinnes, may yet take comfort, and accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t himſelfe to be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
by that onely meanes, that he poſſeſſeth Chriſt by faith: if
this faith faile, and that it muſt giue place to workes or charity,
or to another helpe beſides, then it is but a fable that Chriſt is
the Sauiour of the world, and God alſo founde to bee but a lier,
that hath not performed, what he hath ſo confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly promiſed.</p>
               <p>Let vs now acknowledge the lawe to be as it is, diuine and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and let vs learne of it, both how wee ought to loue God, and
to demeane our ſelues towards our neighbour, &amp; to aske coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile
how wee ſhould be deliuered from ſinne, the power of the
Deuill, and eternall damnation: Let vs haue nothing to do with
the lawe, which in that poynt doth rather terrifie, then miniſter
comfort, heere let vs flie to the goſpell which teacheth vs, that
<pb facs="tcp:16401:25"/>
                  <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> the ſonne of God hath payde the ranſome, with his
precious bloud and redeemed vs from our ſinnes, and here faith
alone willeth vs to receiue this, and to beleeue it: and therefore
when the lawe accuſeth and ſinne terrifieth, let vs looke vppon
Chriſt, laying holde on him by fayth, wee haue then preſent
with vs the conquerour of the lawe, ſinne, death and the deuill
himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Whoſoeuer will diligently conſider of the whole argument of
that booke called the <hi>Actes of the Apostles,</hi> ſhall finde that it tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
nothing elſe, but that the holy Ghoſt is not giuen by the
Lawe, but by the hearing of the goſpell: for when <hi>Peter</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
the holy <hi>Ghoſt</hi> forthwith fell vppon all that heard him: &amp;
in one day three thouſand that were preſent at the preaching of
<hi>Peter,</hi> beleeued and receiued the holy Ghoſt: <hi>Cornelius</hi> receiued
the holy Ghoſt, but not by his almes giuing, but <hi>Peter</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the goſpell of <hi>Chriſt</hi> the holy Ghoſt fell vppon him,
and of all the reſt that were preſent with him, ſo that the whole
ſumme and argument of that Booke is, that wee are iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by fayth onely in Chriſt, without our workes, and that the
holy <hi>Ghost</hi> is giuen, by the onely hearing of fayth at the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the goſpell, and not at the preaching or worke of the
Lawe.</p>
               <p>Well ſayth the papiſt, if the holy <hi>Ghoſt</hi> may be obteyned, but
by hearing of fayth and the goſpell preached, and that there is
nothing elſe required of vs: alas this is but an eaſie matter ſoone
performed, but the giuing of the holy <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> the forgiueneſſe of
ſinnes, the deliuerance from death, are matters of greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then to be ſo eaſily attayned vnto: And therefore if thou
wilt obteyne theſe ineſtimable benefits, there belongs more to it,
then eyther hearing or beleeuing.</p>
               <p>Thus argueth the papiſt, and this ſeemeth conformable to a
mans owne reaſon, and this opinion is well liked, and the Pope,
and the deuill himſelfe will approue it.</p>
               <p>Thus the ineſtimable greatneſſe of the gift, is the cauſe that
wee cannot beleeue it, and becauſe this incomparable treaſure
is freely offered, therefore wee deſpiſe it: but lette Chriſtians
learne, that the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, Chriſt and the holy <hi>Ghost</hi>
are freely giuen vs by hearing of faith, and the goſpell preached.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16401:25"/>
And that wee muſt not ſo much thinke of the greatnes of the
thing that is giuen, nor of our vnworthines that are to receiue it,
as of the greatnes &amp; gratiouſnes of the giuer: we muſt thinke that
it pleaſeth God freely to giue vnto vs, that vnſpeakeable gift as
<hi>Chriſt</hi> hath ſayd <hi>Luke 12. Feare not litle flocke, for it is your fathers
pleaſure to giue vnto you a kingdome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Let fooliſh reaſon now be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
let the papiſt neuer ſpare to rage and raile againſt vs, let
them ſay we teach men to doe nothing at all for the obtaininge
of ſo ineſtimable a gift but to heare the goſpel preached, let them
therfore refraine themſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> going to church, that they might
not partake with vs of this heauenly treaſure but for thoſe that
will exercyſe themſelues in righteouſnes indeede, let them firſt
exerciſe themſelues in the hearing of the goſpell &amp; hauinge once
receiued that, let them giue thanks vnto God: and afterwardes,
let them exerciſe themſelues in thoſe good workes whiche are
commaunded in the lawe, ſo that the lawe and workes, may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
the hearing of fayth: but to ſeeke any iuſtification by the
lawe or by workes we leaue the one to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> the other to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes:
the papiſt teacheth that no man can haue any certayne
knowledge whither hee bee the child of God or no, but he that
doubteth of Gods good will towardes him, that man cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that he hath forgiuenes of ſinnes, but imagineth the tenth
article of the Chriſtian fayth, and maketh doubt of his own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
the papiſt indeede, hath not this feeling, for it belongeth
to none but to him that hath the ſpirit of God: <hi>Knowe ye not your
ſelues, that Chriſt is in you except ye be reprobate perſons,</hi> ſayth Saint
Paule 2. Corin. 13. And in the ſixt to the <hi>Rom. Hee that hath not
the ſpirit of God is none of his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the ſpirit of <hi>God</hi> is the onely marke that is giuen to thoſe
that are elect, now the Papiſt that hath not this feeling, if Saint
<hi>Paules</hi> woordes bee true, is a reprobate, for he hath not the
marke.</p>
               <p>If any man feele in himſelfe a loue towardes the word of God
and willingly heareth, talketh, and thinketh of Chriſt, lette that
man know that it is not the worke of mans wil or reaſon, but the
gift of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>So agayne where the loue of the word and goſpel, is comtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
diſpiſed, and vtterly ſet at naught, as we ſee at this day (but
<pb facs="tcp:16401:26"/>
eſpecially heere in <hi>Ireland</hi>) let them aſſure themſelues that it is
the worke of the deuill, that ſo blindeth their eyes and harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
their hearts.</p>
               <p>Then what are the Papiſtes but the deſtroyers of the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Chriſt, and the builders vppe of the kingdome of the
Deuill: And as witch-craft couenanteth with the Deuill, ſo I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry
couenanteth with God: for thus many prayers, for
thus many <hi>Paternosters,</hi> for thus many creedes, for thus many
<hi>Aues,</hi> for thus many dayes of faſting, for thus many maſſes, for
theſe and many other matters the workes of the fleſh, ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
follies, and that Idolatryes.</p>
               <p>The Papiſtes doe imagine of GOD, to bee but a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
to ſell them his heauenly graces, for their ſtinking me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
               <p>If the doctrine of the <hi>Papiſtes</hi> be true, God nowe receiueth no
more to his mercie, but he receiueth vs to penance, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
they linke together with holy workes, but what holy
workes? ſuch as feede them fat, and pampers them in idleneſſe,
and yet they would ſeeme to fayne that idoll their Pope to be ſo
mercifull that for a little money, there is neyther penance, nor
payne of purgatory, nor faſting, nor abſteyning from any filthy
ſin, eyther of whordome, treaſon, or murther, but he forgiueth
all, and ſendeth them to heauen and that with a trice: And as
they deale with God himſelfe, ſo they deale with the Saintes,
whom they woulde make as malicious and vengible, as the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets</hi>
fayne their furies that tormentes the ſoules in <hi>Hell,</hi> if their
eues be not faſted, their Images viſited and worſhipped with a
Candle, or ſome other offeringes, which muſt bee perfourmed
in thoſe places, that they themſelues haue choſen to heare peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners,
and to receiue their ſupplications: ſo that there is no
mercy remaining in <hi>God,</hi> nor in his Saints, but all reſteth in the
Pope alone.</p>
               <p>And the Pope is not onely more mercifull then <hi>God,</hi> but if
a manne may beeleeue our papiſtes, hee is more powerfull then
<hi>God:</hi> for <hi>God</hi> (ſay they) if a manne committe a ſinne, vppon
due repentance, hee forgiueth the offence onely, but not the
payne that is due to the offence, ſauing that hee turneth an
euerlaſting payne, but to a temporall payne, and appoynteth
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16401:26"/>
ſeuen yeares plunging in purgatorie for euery deadly ſinne,
but the Pope abſolueth all, both <hi>a paena &amp; Culpa,</hi> aſwell from
the payne that is due to the faulte, as from the faulte it
ſelfe.</p>
               <p>And whereas <hi>God</hi> forgiueth no ſinne but vpon due repentance
the Pope neuer lookes after that, money is the matter that hee
ſtandes vppon, he that hath money ſhal haue a plenary remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for as many horrible ſinnes as any man is able to commit, let
him chooſe whether he will repent or no, he ſhall be forgiuen, &amp;
for a neede if a man be diſpoſed to committe a horrible murther
the Pope will giue him abſolution before hand.</p>
               <p>The whole doctrine of the Pope tendeth to couetouſneſſe to
robbe the ſimple and ignorant people, looke into their purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that onely ſerueth but to purge mens purſes, and wherefore
ſerueth pardons but for the ſame purpoſe, their offeringes to
Sayntes but to fill their bellies, their treatales and all other traſh,
what are they but meere coſenages and flat robberies?</p>
               <p>The infinite number of Popiſh prieſtes that be in <hi>Ireland</hi> doth
make a great commoditie amongſt the ſilly people, of this only
conceit, that for a little money beſtowed vppon them, they will
not onely vndertake to doe good workes for them, but will alſo
vndertake to ſtand between <hi>God</hi> and them, and to take all their
ſinnes vppon themſelues.</p>
               <p>Thus powerfull is the Pope if our papiſts ſay true, that he can
forgiue more then any can offend, but as for <hi>God,</hi> they make him
but an hypocrite, to forgiue vs the fault, but not the payne that
is due to the fault: but <hi>Pau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> ſayes he gaue himſelfe for our ſinnes,
if he gaue himſelfe to death for our ſinnes, without doubt hee is
no tyrant, as the papiſtes woulde make him: hee that will giue
himſelfe to death for vs, will neyther condemne vs, nor take plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure
in our torment.</p>
               <p>What vnkindneſſe in our papiſtes that without any authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of ſcripture, will yet ſeeke to diſpoyle <hi>God</hi> of his honor, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
that he hath not deliuered vs aſwell from the paine as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the ſin: and what blaſphemy to thinke that Chriſts bloud, was
not ſufficient, to giue full remiſſion to his faythfull, aſwell for
the one as for the other: or for what intent ſhould the payne be
reſerued to ſatisfie towardes <hi>God,</hi> when all the paynes of <hi>Hell</hi> are
<pb facs="tcp:16401:27"/>
not able to purge one ſinne or to ſatisfie for it, which if it were,
in continuance of time, the damned ſoules ſhould be deliuered
from Hell.</p>
               <p>For our better vnderſtanding let vs heere conſider the ſinnes
which we doe commit, if they ſhould be meaſured by our ſelues
that doe commit them, they could be but finite: for of men that
are of themſelues but finite, how ſhould come that which is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite?
but tranſgreſſion is increaſed according to the proportion of
him againſt whom it is committed: the ſinnes which we commit
then, are againſt the infinite Maieſtie of God, in regard of whom
our ſinnes are truely infinite: to an infinite offence, then doth
belong an infinite puniſhment, which could neuer be borne nor
remitted, but of that which was likewiſe infinite: God by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
grace hath giuen vs his ſonne infinite as himſelfe to beare
it: our Sauiour by his infinite power, hath borne and ſwallowed
vpour infinite paine, and that further by his infinite obedience
purchaſed for vs Gods infinite grace: hee doth then forgiue vs
that debt which another hath payd him, hee doth furthermore
forgiue vs that puniſhment, which another hath borne for vs:
thus as in the ſinnes which wee committ, God had regard vnto
himſelfe againſt whom it was committed, ſo in the ſatisfaction
for the ſinne, he had the like reſpect to that which was done, by
our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, and thus againſt an infinite
puniſhment hee hath oppoſed an infinite grace: the puniſhment
was infinite in reſpect of God, grace was infinite for his ſake
that ſuffered, who was likewiſe God and man, but if Chriſt hath
redeemed vs from the ſinne and not from the paine, as the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt
would perſwade, then grace ſhould looſe his grace, and we
ſhould ſtill remaine in the ſtate of damnation.</p>
               <p>Me thinkes our papiſts ſhould now be aſhamed of their Pope
that dates thus preſume to eclips the glory of Gods mercy, and
the worthines of Chriſtes ſatisfaction: but alas what ſhoulde I
ſpeake of ſhame vnto them that haue forgotten to bluſh? <hi>Chriſt
hath choſen vs before the beginning of the world, that we might bee holy
and without ſpot in his ſight.</hi> Ephe. 1.</p>
               <p>If through his choſing and election we be without ſpot in his
ſight, what buzzardly blindnes to ſuppoſe, that hee will yet haue
vs to be tormented in Purgatory, as theſe popelings do beleeue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:16401:27"/>
But it will be ſayde, why who is ſo righteous but that hee may
ſay his <hi>Pater noſter</hi> of the which one part is <hi>Forgiue vs our treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
as wee forgiue them that treſpaſſe againſt vs?</hi> And it is truth, there
liueth no man vpon earth without ſinne: notwithſtanding, all
thoſe that were choſen in Chriſt before the foundation of the
world was layd, are without ſpot of ſinne in the ſight of God: ſo
that they are both ſinners and righteous: if wee conſider our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
members, which as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth, <hi>are ſolde vnder ſinne</hi>
Rom. 7. then wee are greiuous ſinners, but contrary, if wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that by the mercifull fauour of God, hee hath freely giuen
vs his Chriſt, and with him all things, ſo that we bee deſtitute of
no gift, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth teſtifie Rom. 8. then are wee righteous in
his ſight, and our conſcience at peace with God: and what haue
we then to doe with Purgatory?</p>
               <p>But leauing a number of teſtimonies, that might be cited out
of the holy ſcriptures witneſſing the promiſes: let this ſuffice that
is auouched by the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> whom his 32 Pſalme ſayth
<hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe iniquitie as forgiuen,</hi> And making expoſition of
his owne wordes, hee proceedeth, <hi>Bleſſed hee whoſe ſinnes are
couered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nowe who can couer his ſinnes from the ſight of God, who
ſetteth the moſt ſecret ſinners that are, in the light of his counti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
that looketh into the very imginations of men, that are
nothing elſe but euill continually? or wherewith may a man ſo
couer his ſinnes, but that they will breake out? for what can be
hid from that peircing ſight that ſeeth in man, that he diſcerneth
not in himſelfe, that did firſt knowe him before hee was created,
and hath iuſtly calculated and caſt vp all his ſinnes, all his abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
before they were euer acted or done?</p>
               <p>But wherewith ſhall wee ſeeke to couer them, what with good
workes, as <hi>Adam</hi> did with figge leaues? it is hypocriſie, and the
holy hypocrit, &amp; the proud Phariſee, is more odible in the ſight
of God, then the Publican or harlot.</p>
               <p>How then ſhall we couer our ſinnes, for couered they muſt be,
and we muſt appeare holy and without ſpot in his ſight: how are
they then to be couered they are then couered from God, when
they be couered by God, then are they couered from his wrath,
when they be couered by his mercy, and they ſhall bee couered
<pb facs="tcp:16401:28"/>
by his mercy, when they bee couered by the precious bloode of
our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, who is our propitiation &amp; righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
hee that ſeeketh any other couerture then this, ſeeketh but
with <hi>Adam</hi> to hide himſelfe in the thicket of a buſh, where the
iuſtice of God will finde him out.</p>
               <p>It followeth in the next verſe, <hi>Bleſſed is the man, to whome God
imputeth not his ſinne, and in whoſe ſpirite there is no guile:</hi> but why is
it not ſayd heere, bleſſed is he that hath not ſinned at all, or bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

               <p>Becauſe the moſt righteous man ſinneth ſeuen times a day, yea
that great Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe was left with a pricke in his

               </p>

                  <hi>He therefore can not be bleſſed that ſtands of his owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes:
but</hi> Bleſſed is he to whome God imputeth not his ſinne, in
whoſe ſpirit there is no guile.</p>
               <p>But who is now this bleſſed one, or where is hee to bee found,
for if there be none bleſſed, but he that hath a pure and a cleane
ſpirit, where ſhall we ſeeke him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But let vs compare the wordes as they ſtand, in the firſt verſe
it is ſayd,</hi> Bleſſed is he whoſe iniquitie is forgiuen, Bleſſed is hee whoſe
ſinnes are couered: <hi>it followeth in the ſecond verſe,</hi> Bleſſed is he to
whom the Lord imputeth not his ſinne, in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile.</p>
               <p>Why then to him whoſe iniquitie is forgiuen, to him the Lord
imputeth not his ſinne: And to him againe whoſe ſinne it hath
pleaſed God to couer, that man is reputed to bee of an vpright
heart: ſo that the wordes are expounded the one by the other:
thoſe then are not bleſſed that thinke to couer their ſinnes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
but thoſe whoſe ſinnes are couered by the mercy of God:
And who are thoſe whoſe ſinnes it pleaſeth God ſo to couer? e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
thoſe that doe diſcouer themſelues freely vnto him: the <hi>man
in whoſe heart there is found no guile.</hi>

Not him that doth make ſhowe to be honeſt, and yet is full of
deceit, as our <hi>Merit-mongers,</hi> and <hi>Iuſtitiaries,</hi> that will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
no ſinne, but doe iuſtifie themſelues by their owne deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges:
but bleſſed are thoſe that will confeſſe their ſinnes, and
righteous by conſequence, are thoſe whome God hath iuſtified
in forgiuing their ſinnes, imputing vnto them the righteouſnes,
of his ſonne: for ſeeing we haue loſt our originall righteouſnes,
we haue not in vs any righteouſnes greater, then to confeſſe our
vnrighteouſnes, neither can wee recouer any other righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to helpe vs, then that the Father hath imputed vnto vs in
his Sonne.</p>
               <p>I haue hetherto proſecuted the impieties of popery, howe it
ſecludeth Chriſt, &amp; burieth all the benefitts of his precious death
and paſſion: I might yet ſpeake of many other abhominations
that are hatched vp in the Romiſh Chruch, as their adoring of
Images, their publicke ſeruice in an vnknowne tongue, not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
by the people, their ſacrificing of the ſonne of God to
his Father for the ſinnes of the world, their adoring the eliments
of bread and wine, with diuine honour in ſtead of Chriſt, their
ſhrift, their releaſing of ſoules out of Purgatory by prayers and
pardons, their inioyning of Prieſts to ſingle life, whereby they
doe liue in whoredome, and in loathſome and filthy vncleanes.</p>
               <p>Theſe, with many other ſuperſtitions, &amp; errours in doctrine,
might yet bee ſpoken of, the which for the preſent time I omitt:
now what account God will exact, for his name blaſphemed, his
Sonne refuſed, his ſacramentes prophaned, and his worde thus
deſpiſed, is much to be feared, in the meane time, let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
the Father of glory, to giue vs the ſpirit of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
knowledge and vnderſtanding, and
ſo to inlighten the eyes of our minde,
that wee may knowe his wayes,
and bee led through faith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the knowledge of him
that is all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
