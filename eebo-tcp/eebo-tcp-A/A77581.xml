            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:169718:6"/>
dead men, than diſquiet in a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full converſation amongſt the living. Which I ingenuouſly confeſſe, to be one chief motive of dedicating theſe exerciſes of my youth to that Worthy Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> ſo long ſince departed. For had I grounded my ends upon active Wiſedomes of the preſent, or ſought Patronage out of hope, or fear in the future; Who knowes not, that there are ſome No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble friends of mine, and many Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Magiſtrates yet living, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom both my Fortune, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation were, and are far more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? But beſides this ſelf-reſpect of Dedication, the debt I acknowledge to that Gentleman is farre greater, as with whom I ſhall ever account it honour to have been brought up: and in whom the life it ſelf of true worth, did (by way of example) far exceed the pictures of it in any moral Precepts. So that (if my creation had been equal) it would have proved as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169718:6"/>
eaſie for me, to have followed his patern, in the practice of reall vertue, as to engage my ſelf into this <hi>Characteriſticall</hi> kind of Poeſie: in defence whereof he hath written ſo much, as I ſhall not need to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing. For that this repreſenting of vertues, vices, humours, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells, and actions of men unfeigned, and unſcandalous Images, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling of free-born ſpirits to the greateſt affaires of States: he himſelf hath left ſuch an inſtance in the too ſhort ſcene of his life, as I fear ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages will not draw a line out of any other mans ſphere to parallel with it.</p>
            <p>For my own part, I obſerved, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and loved him ſo much; as with what caution ſoever I have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through my dayes hitherto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>among the living, yet in him I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a kind of freedome even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the dead. So that although with <hi>Socrates,</hi> I profeſſe to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:169718:7"/>
for the preſent; yet with <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor</hi> I am delighted in repeating old newes of the ages paſt; and will therefore ſtir up my drooping me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory touching this mans worth, powers, wayes, and deſignes: to the end that in the tribute I owe him, our nation may ſee a Sea-mark, rais'd upon their native coaſt, above the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell of any private Pharos abroad: and ſo by a right Meridian line of their own, learn to ſayl through the ſtraits of true vertue, into a calm, and ſpacious Ocean of humane ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>It is ordinary among men to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the races of horſes, and breeds of other cattle. But few conſider, that as divers humors mixt in mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies make different complexions; ſo every Family hath, as it were, divers predominant qualities in it: which, as they are tempered together in Marriage, give a certain tincture to all the deſcent. In my time, I have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169718:7"/>
obſerved it in many houſes, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this. Sir <hi>Henry Sidney</hi> his Father was a man of excellent naturall wit, large heart, ſweet converſation: and ſuch a Governour, as ſought not to make an end of the State in himſelf, but to plant his own ends in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of his Countrey. Witnes his ſound eſtabliſhments both in <hi>Wales,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> where his Memory is worthily grateful unto this day: how unequall, &amp; bitter ſoever the cenſure of Provincialls is uſually, againſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Monarchall Governours, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch, as though in worth and place ſuperior, are yet in their own degrees of heraldry, inferior to them.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, his Mother, as ſhe was a woman by deſcent of great Nobility, ſo was ſhe by nature of a large ingenuous ſpirit. Whence, as it were even racked with native ſtrengths, ſhee choſe rather to hide her ſelf from the curious eyes of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate time, than come up on the ſtage
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169718:8"/>
of the world with any manner of diſparagement, the miſchance of ſickneſſe having caſt ſuch a kind of veile over her excellent beauty, as the modeſty of that ſex doth many times upon their native, and heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſpirits.</p>
            <p>So that it may probably be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therd, that this clearneſſe of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers judgement, and ingenious ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſſe of his Mothers, brought forth ſo happy a temper in this well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt Ofspring of theirs, as (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out envy be it ſpoken) Sir <hi>Philip</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be accompted amongſt thoſe eminent Plants of our ſoyl, which blaſt, or bite not, but rather ſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Of whoſe Youth I will report no

other wonder, but this; That though I lived with him, and knew him from a child, yet I never knew him other than a man: with ſuch ſtaiedneſſe of mind, lovely, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar gravity, as carried grace, and reverence above greater years. His talk ever of knowledge, and his very play tending to enrich his mind: So as even his teachers found ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in him to obſerve, and learn, above that which they had uſually read, or taught. Which eminence, by nature, and induſtry, made his worthy Father ſtile Sir <hi>Philip</hi> in my hearing (though I unſeen) <hi>Lumen fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliae ſuae.</hi> But why doe I mention this relative harmony of worth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Father and Son? Did not his Country ſoon after take knowledge of him as a Light, or leading Star to every degree within her? Are not the Arts and Languages, which ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him to Travail at fourteen years old, and in his Travail to win

reverence amongſt the chief Learned men abroad, Witneſſes beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception that there was great inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of worth and goodneſſe in him?</p>
            <p>Inſtance that reverend <hi>Languet,</hi> mentioned for honours ſake in Sir <hi>Philip</hi>'s <hi>Arcadia,</hi> learned <hi>uſque ad mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculum;</hi> wiſe by the conjunction of practice in the world, with that well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Theory of Books, &amp; much valued at home; till this great Worth (even in a Gentlemans for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune) being diſcovered for a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inſtrument againſt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> by ſome ſparkles got light e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, rather to ſeek employment elſwhere, than to tarry, and be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of his own Country with diſparagement. In <hi>Franckford</hi> he ſettles, is entertained Agent for the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and an under-hand Miniſter for his own King.

Nay to goe yet farther in this private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; It may pleaſe the Reader to obſerve, how the ſame parallel of worth, in what age, or eſtate ſoever, as it hath power to win, ſo hath it likewiſe abſolute power to keep. Far unlike thoſe creations of chance, which hath other birds egges; and by advancing men out of chance or complement, loſe them again as faſt by neglect. Contrary to which, even when diverſity of years, courſes of life, and fortunes, enforced theſe dear Friends to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, there yet paſſed ſuch a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall courſe of intelligence by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from one of them to another, as in their loſſe (if they be loſt) there be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:169718:10"/>
buried many delicate images, and differences, between the reall, and large complexions of thoſe active times, and the narrow <hi>ſalves</hi> of this effeminate age: Becauſe in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent mould of their friendſhip, the greateſt buſineſſes of Eſtate were ſo mixed with the ſweet remiſſions of ingenuous good will, as men might eaſily diſcern in them (as unflatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring glaſſes) that wiſdome, and love, in good ſpirits have great affinity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. For a farther demonſtration, behold even the ſame <hi>Languet</hi> (after he was ſixty ſix years of age) faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himſelf a journey into <hi>England,</hi> with the Duke <hi>Caſimire,</hi> onely to ſee that excellent Plant of his own poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing. In which loving, and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected meeting, I dare confidently affirm, neither ſide became loſer. At the ſea they parted, and made many mutuall tears omnious propheciers of their never meeting again.</p>
            <p>Theſe little ſparks of two large
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169718:11"/>
natures I make bold the longer to inſiſt upon, becauſe the youth, life and fortune of this Gentleman were indeed but ſparkes of extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry greatneſſe in him: which for want of clear vent lay concealed, and in a maner ſmothered up. And again to bring the children of favor, and change, into an equall ballance of compariſon with birth, worth, and education: and therein abruptly to conclude, that God creates thoſe in his certain, and eternall mouldes, out of which he elects for himſelf; where Kings chooſe creatures out of <hi>Pandoras</hi> Tun, and ſo raiſe up worth, and no worth; friends or enemies at adventure. Therefore what mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail can it be, if theſe <hi>Iacobs,</hi> and <hi>Eſaus</hi> ſtrive ambitiouſly one with another, as well before as after they come out of ſuch erring, and unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect wombes?</p>
            <p>Now from theſe particular teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to goe on with Sir <hi>Philips</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:169718:11"/>
life: though he purpoſed no monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of books to the world, out of this great harveſt of knowledge; yet doe not his Arcadian Romanties live after him, admired by our foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyd Criticks? who, howſoever their common end upon common arts be to affect reputation by depraving cenſure; yet where nature placeth excellencie above envy, there (it ſeemeth) ſhe ſubjecteth theſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping eyes to wander, and ſhewes the judicious reader, how he may be nouriſhed in the delicacy of his own judgement.</p>
            <p>For inſtance; may not the moſt refined ſpirits, in the ſcope of theſe dead images (even as they are now) finde, that when Soveraign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to play with their own viſions, will put off publique action, which is the ſplendor of Majeſtie, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actively charge the managing of their greateſt affaires upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond-hand faith, and diligence of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:169718:12"/>
Deputies, may they not (I ſay) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that even then they bury themſelves, and their Eſtates in a cloud of contempt, and under it both encourage, and ſhaddow the the conſpiracies of ambitious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alternes to their falſe endes. I mean the ruine of States and Princes?</p>
            <p>Again, where Kingly Parents will ſuffer, or rather force their wives and daughters, to deſcend from the inequality and reſervedneſſe of Princely education, into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible familiarity, and popular freedome of Shepherds; may we not diſcern that even therein they give thoſe Royall birthes warrant, or opportunity, to break over all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of honor, ſafe-guards to the modeſty of that ſex; and withall make them fraily, apt to change the commanding manners of Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Birth, into the degrading images of ſervile baſeneſſe? Laſtly, where humor takes away this pomp, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:169718:12"/>
               <hi>apparatus</hi> from King, Crown, and Scepter, to make fear a Counſellor, and obſcurity a wiſdom; be that King at home what the current, or credit of his former Government, for a a while, may keep him: yet he is ſure among forrain Princes to be juſtly cenſured as a Princely Shepherd, or Shepherdiſh King: which creatures of ſcorn ſeldome fail to become fit ſacrifices for home-born diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or ambitious forrain ſpirits to undertake, and offer up.</p>
            <p>Againe, who ſees not the chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able arrivall of <hi>Euarchus</hi> into <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia;</hi> his unexpected election to the temporary Soveraignty of that State; his ſitting in a cloudy ſeat of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to give ſentence (under a maſk of Shepherds) againſt his Son, Nephew, Neeces, the immediate ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors to that Scepter; and all accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and condemned of rape, pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, adulteries, or treaſons, by their own Lawes: I ſay who ſees not, that

that various, and dainty work of his, for ſounder judgements to exerciſe their Spirits in; ſo that if the infancie of theſe <hi>Ideas,</hi> determining in the firſt generation, yield the ingenuous Reader ſuch pleaſant &amp; profitable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, both of flowers, and fruits, let him conceive, if this excellent Image-maker had liv'd to finiſh, and bring to perfection this extraordinary frame of his own Common-wealth: I meane, the return of <hi>Baſilius,</hi> from his dreames of humor, to the honor of his former Eſtate; the marriage of the two ſiſters with the two excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Princes; their iſſue; the warres ſtirred up by <hi>Amphialus;</hi> his marriage with <hi>Helena;</hi> their ſucceſſions; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the incident Magnificen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, pompes of ſtate, providences of councells in treaties of peace, or ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſummons of warres, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly execution of their diſorders; I ſay, what a large field an active able ſpirit ſhould have had to walk in, let
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:169718:14"/>
the adviſed Reader conceive with grief. Eſpecially if he pleaſe to take knowledge, that in all theſe creatures of his making, his intent, and ſcope was, to turn the barren Philoſphy precepts into pregnant Images of life; and in them, firſt on the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch's part, lively to repreſent the growth, ſtate, and declination of Princes, change of Government, and lawes: viciſſitudes of ſedition, facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſucceſſion, confederacies, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, with all other errors, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations in publique affaires. Then again in the ſubjects caſe; the ſtate of favor, diſfavor, proſperitie, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, emulation, quarrell, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, retiring, hoſpitality, travail, and all other moodes of private for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, or misfortunes. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n which tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes (I know) his purpoſe was to limn out ſuch exact pictures, of every poſture in the minde, that any man being forced, in the ſtraines of this life, to paſs through any ſtraights, or
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:169718:14"/>
latitudes of good, or ill fortune, might (as in a glaſſe) ſee how to ſet a good countenance upon all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenances of adverſitie, and a ſtay upon the exorbitant ſmiling of chance.</p>
            <p>Now, as I know this was the firſt project of theſe workes, rich (like his youth) in the freedome of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wit, learning, ſtile, form, and facilitie, to pleaſe others: ſo muſt I again (as ingenuouſly) confeſs, that when his body declined, and his piercing inward powers were lifted up to a purer Horizon, he then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, not onely the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but vanitie of theſe ſhadowes, how daintily ſoever limned: as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that even beauty it ſelf, in all earthly complexions, was more apt to allure men to evill, than to faſhion any goodneſs in them. And from this ground, in that memorable te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of his, he bequeathed no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther legacie, but the fire, to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poliſhed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:169718:15"/>
Embrio. From which fate it is onely reſerved, untill the world hath purged away all her more groſs corruptions.</p>
            <p>Again, they that knew him well, will truly confeſs, this <hi>Arcadia</hi> of his to be, both in form, and matter, as much inferior to that unbounded ſpirit of his, as the induſtry and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of other mens works, are many times raiſed above the writers capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities: and beſides acknowledge, that howſoever he could not chooſe but give them many aſperſions of ſpirit, and learning from the Father; yet that they were ſcribled rather as pamphlets, for entertainment of time, and friends, than any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of himſelf to the world. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if his pupoſe had been to leave his memory in books, I am confident, in the right uſe of Logick, Philoſophy, Hiſtory, and Poëſie, nay even in the moſt ingenuous of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall Arts, he would have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:169718:15"/>
ſuch tracts of a ſearching, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious ſpirit; as the profeſſors of every faculty would have ſtriven no leſs for him, than the ſeaven Cities did to have <hi>Homer</hi> of their Sept. But the truth is: his end was not wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, even while he wrote; nor his knowledge moulded for tables, or ſchooles; but both his wit, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding bent upon his heart, to make himſelf, and others, not in words or opinion, but in life, and action, good and great.</p>
            <p>In which Architectonical art he was ſuch a Maſter, with ſo commending, and yet equall waies amongſt men, that wherſoever he went, he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and obeyed: yea into what Action ſoever he came laſt at the firſt, he became firſt at the laſt: the whole managing of the buſineſs, not by uſurpation, or violence, but (as it were) by right, and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, falling into his hands, as into a naturall Center.</p>

that worthy Prince of <hi>Orange, Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> with whom this young Gentleman having long kept intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence by word, and letters, and in affaires of the higeſt nature that then paſſed currant upon the ſtages of <hi>England, France, Germany, Italy,</hi> the low Countries, or <hi>Spaine,</hi> it ſeemes that this young Gentleman had, by his mutuall freedome, ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed the extraordinary merit of his young yeares into the large wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and experience of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Ptince, as I paſſing out of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and having the unexpected honor to finde this Prince in the Town <hi>Delph,</hi> cannot think it unwelcome to deſcribe the clothes of this Prince; his poſture of body, and minde, familiarity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedneſs to ths ingenuous Reader, that he may ſee with what diverſe Characters Princes pleaſe, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern Cities, Townes, and Peoples.</p>
            <p>His uppermoſt garment was a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:169718:17"/>
gown, yet ſuch as (I dare confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm) a mean-born ſtudent, in our Innes of Court, would not have been well-pleaſed to walk the ſtreets in. Unbuttoned his doubled was, and of like precious matter, and form to the other. His waſt-coat (which ſhewed it ſelf under it) not unlike the beſt ſort of thoſe wollen knit ones, which our ordinary wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termen row us in. His Company a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, the Burgeſſes of that beer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewing Town: and he ſo fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like encompaſſed with them, as (had I not known his face) no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior ſigne of degree, or deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could have diſcovered the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of his worth or Eſtate from that multitude Not withſtanding I no ſooner came to his preſence, but it pleaſed him to take knowledge of me And even upon that (as if it had been a ſignall to make a change) his reſpect of a ſtranger inſtantly begat reſpect to himſelf in all about him:

An outward paſſage of inward greatneſs, which in a popular E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate I thought worth the obſerving. Becauſe there, no pedigree but worth could poſſibly make a man Prince, and no Prince, in a moment, at his own pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The buſineſſes which he then vouchſafed to impart with me were, the dangerous fate which the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> States of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Low Countries did ſtand threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with, under an ambitious, and conquering Monarch's hand. The main inſtance, a ſhort deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spaniards curious affecting to keep the Romans waies, and ends, in all his actions. On the other ſide, the clear ſymptomes of the Hectique feaver, univerſally then reigning among the Princes of Chriſtendome, ordain'd (as he thought) to behold this undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning diſeaſe without fear, till it ſhould prove dangerous, nay incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

Againe, on the Queens part, by the way of queſtion, he ſuppoſed a little neglect in her Princely mildneſs, while ſhe did ſuffer a Proteſtant par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, rais'd by God in that great King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>France,</hi> to be a ballance or counterpeaſe to that dangerous <hi>Hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchy of Spain</hi> (then ſcarce viſible, but ſince multiplyed by an unreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able greatneſſe) I ſay, for ſuffering this ſtrong and faithfull party (through want of imployment) to ſink into it ſelf, and ſo unactively (like a Meteor) to vaniſh, or ſmother out, in vain and idle apparitions. Withall reverently hee demurr'd, whether it were an omiſſion in that excellent Ladies Government, or no, by a remiſſe looking on, whilſt the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> aſpiring family framed occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to gain by begging peace, or buying war from the Grand Signior; and both exceeding much to their own ends; In reſpect that once in few years, this Emperor made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:169718:19"/>
Generall by it, over all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſtendome; and thereby gained the fame of action; trained up his owne Inſtruments Martially, and got credit with his fellow-bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Princes, through the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Councell, or participation of fear. Beſides that in the concluſions of peace, he ever ſaved a maſs of riches gather'd by Diets, Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Devotions, and Levies for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon defence, which out of the ill-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compting hand of war, became (in his Exchequer) Treaſure, to terrifie even thoſe Chriſtian neighbours that did contribute to it. And the more eſpecially he inſiſted upon this: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all thoſe crafty Pageants of her enemies were diſguiſedly acted, even whilſt her Majeſty had an Agent of extraordinary diligence, worth, and credit with that vaſt Eſtate of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie, into whoſe abſolute and imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirit, without any further charge than infuſing the jealouſies of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169718:19"/>
competition, theſe practiſes among thoſe Auſtrian uſurpers, might eaſily have been interrupted.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it pleaſed him to queſtion yet a greater over-ſight in both theſe Kingdoms, <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>France:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe while their Princes ſtood at gaze, as upon things far off, they ſtill gave way for the Popiſh, and Spaniſh inviſible Arts, and Counſels, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine the greatneſs, and freedom both of Secular and Eccleſiaſticall Princes: a mortall ſickneſs in that vaſt body of <hi>Germany,</hi> and by their inſenſible fall, a raiſing up of the houſe of <hi>Austria</hi> many ſteps towards her long affected Monarchy over the Weſt. The ground of which opinion was (as he thought) in reſpect that even the Catholique Princes, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops themſelves (had their eyes bin well wakened) would never have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured any cloud, or colour of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to hape changed their Princely Soveraignties into ſuch a kind of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:169718:20"/>
low, and Chaplaine tenure: as ſince they have ſleepily fallen into: but would rather have ſtirred them with many hands, to binde this Miter-ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, with the reall cords of truth. And to that end perchance have ſet <hi>Spain</hi> on work with her new, and ill digeſted Conqueſts: her dangerous enemie <hi>Feſs:</hi> her native <hi>Moors,</hi> and <hi>Iews</hi> (ſince craftily tranſported) and ſo probably have troubled the uſurpations both of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> over that well-tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, though over-zealous, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions Region of <hi>It a'y.</hi> Theſe, and ſuch other particulars, as I had in charge, and did faithfully deliver from him to her Majeſty, are ſince performed, or periſhed with time, or occaſion.</p>
            <p>The laſt branch was his free ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of himſelfe in the honour of Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> after this manner: That I would firſt commend his own humble ſervice, with thoſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:169718:20"/>
fore-mentioned Ideas to the Queen; and after crave leave of her freely to open his knowledge, and opinion of a Fellow-ſervant of his, that (as he heard) lived unimployed under her. With himſelfe he began <hi>ab ovo,</hi> as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been of <hi>Charles</hi> the fift's Privie Counſell, before he was one and twenty years of age: and ſince (as the world knew) either an Actor, or at leaſt acquainted with the greateſt actions, and affairs of <hi>Europe;</hi> and likewiſe with her greateſt men, and miniſters of Eſtate. In all which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of time, multitude of things, and perſons, he proteſted unto mee (and for her ſervice) that if he could judge, her Majeſty had one of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, and greateſt Counſellors of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate in Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> that at this day lived in <hi>Europe:</hi> to the triall of which hee was pleaſed to leave his owne credit engaged, untill her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty might pleaſe to employ this Gentleman, either amongſt her friends or enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:169718:21"/>
At my return into <hi>England,</hi> I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed all his other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandments; this that concerned Sir <hi>Philip</hi> (thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to make the fine-ſpun threads of Friendſhip more firm between them) I acquainted Sir <hi>Philip</hi> with: not as queſtioning, but fully reſolved to doe it. Unto which he at the firſt ſight oppoſing, diſcharged my faith impawn'd to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> for the delivery of it; as an act only entending his good, and ſo to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, or diſpens'd with at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; yet for my ſatisfaction freely added theſe words: firſt, that the Qu. had the life it ſelf daily attending her: and if ſhe either did not, or would not value it ſo highly, the commendation of that worthy Prince could be no more (at the beſt) than a lively picture of that life, and ſo of far leſſe credit, and eſtimation with her. His next reaſon was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Princes love not that forrain Powers ſhould have extraordinary
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:169718:21"/>
in their Subjects; much leſſe to be taught by them how they ſhould place their own: as arguments either upbraiding ignorance, or lack of large rewarding goodneſs in them</p>
            <p>This Narration I adventure of, to ſhew the clearneſs, and readineſs of this Gentlemans judgement, in all degrees, and offices of life: with this farther teſtimony of him; that after mature deliberation being once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, he never brought any queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of change to afflict himſelf with, or perplex the buſineſs; but left the ſucceſs to his will, that governs the blinde proſperities, and unproſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Chance; and ſo works out his own ends by the erring frailties of humane reaſon and affection. Laſtly, to manifeſt that theſe were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, ſelf-ends, or uſe of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to our modern faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but meer ingenuities of ſpirit, to which the ancient greatneſs of hearts ever frankly engaged their Fortunes,

            <p>My ſecond inſtance comes from the Earle of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> his unckle, who told me (after Sir <hi>Philips,</hi> and not long before his own death) that when he undertook the government of the Low Countries, he carryed his Nephew over with him, as one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, not only deſpiſing his youth for a Counſellor, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bearing a hand over him as a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward young man. Notwithſtanding, in ſhort time he ſaw this Sun ſo riſen above his Horizon, that both he and all his Stars were glad to fetch light from him. And in the end acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged that he held up the honor of his caſual authority by him, whilſt he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, &amp; found reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from that burthen, after his death.</p>
            <p>My third record is Sir <hi>Francis Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingham</hi> his Father-in-law; that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:169718:22"/>
wiſe, and active Secretarie. This man (as the world knows) upheld both Religion and State, by uſing a policy wiſely mixt with reflexions of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He had influence in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, &amp; a hand upon all affairs; Yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this man hath often confeſſed to my ſelf, that his <hi>Philip</hi> did ſo far over-ſhoot him in his own Bow, as thoſe friends which at firſt were Sir <hi>Philip</hi>'s for this Secretaries ſake, within a while became ſo fully owned, and poſſeſt by Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> as now he held them at the ſecond hand, by his Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-laws native courteſie.</p>
            <p>This is that true remiſſion of mind, whereof I would gladly have the world take notice from theſe dead mens aſhes: to the end that we might once again ſee that ingenuity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, which by liberall bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring witneſſe to the merits of others, ſhews they have ſome true worth of their own; and are not meerly lovers of themſelves, without rivals.</p>

            <p>TO continue this paſſage a little further: I muſt lift him above the cenſure of Subjects, and give you an account what reſpect, and honour his worth wanne him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the moſt eminent Monarchs of that time. As firſt with that chief, and beſt of Princes, his moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Majeſty, then King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to whom his ſervice was affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately devoted, and from whom he received many pledges of love, and favour.</p>
            <p>In like manner, with the late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> then of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi> who having meaſured, and maſtered all the ſpirits in his own Nation, found out this Maſter-ſpirit among us, and uſed him like an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall in nature, and ſo fit for friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with a King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:169718:23"/>
Again, that gallant Prince <hi>Don John de Auſtria,</hi> Vice-Roy in the Low Countries for <hi>Spain,</hi> when this Gentleman in his Embaſſage to the Emperor came to kiſs his hand, though at the firſt, in his Spaniſh haughture, he gave him acceſs as by deſcent to a youth, of grace as to a ſtranger, and in particular competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as he conceived) to an enemy; yet after a while that he had taken his juſt altitude, he found himſelf ſo ſtricken with this extraordinary Planet, that the beholders wondered to ſee what ingenuous tribute that brave, and high minded Prince paid to his worth; giving more honour and reſpect to this hopefull young Gentleman, than to the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of mighty Priuces.</p>
            <p>But to climb yet a degree higher: In what due eſtimation his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Worth was, even amongſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, will appear by his death. When <hi>Mendoza,</hi> a Secretary of many
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:169718:24"/>
Treaſons againſt us, acknowledged openly; That howſoever he was glad King <hi>Philip</hi> his Maſter had loſt, in a private Gentleman, a dangerous Enemy to his Eſtate; yet he could not but lament to ſee Chriſtendome depriv'd of ſo rare a Light in theſe cloudy times; and bewail poor Widdow <hi>England</hi> (ſo he term'd her) that having been many years in bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one eminent ſpirit, was in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment bereaved of him, by the hands of a villain.</p>
            <p>Indeed he was a true modell of Worth; A man fit for Conqueſt, Plantation, Reformation, or what Action ſoever is greateſt, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt amongſt men: Withall, ſuch a lover of Mankind, and Goodneſſe, that whoſoever had any reall parts, in him found comfort, participation, and protection to the uttermoſt of his power; like <hi>Zephyrus</hi> he giving life where he blew. The Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties abroad, and at home, accompted
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169718:24"/>
him a generall <hi>Mecaenas</hi> of Learning; Dedicated their Books to him; and communicated every Invention, or Improvement of Knowledge with him. Souldiers honoured him, and were ſo honoured by him, as no man thought he marched under the true Banner of <hi>Mars,</hi> that had not obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi>'s approbation. Men of Affairs in moſt parts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, entertained correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with him. But what ſpeak I of theſe, with whom his own waies, and ends did concur? ſince (to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend) his heart, and capacity were ſo large, that there was not a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Painter, a ſkilfull Engenier, an excellent Muſician, or any other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer of extraordinary fame, that made not himſelf known to this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Spirit, and found him his true friend without hire; and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Reude-vous</hi> of Worth in his time.</p>
            <p>Now let Princes vouchſafe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:169718:25"/>
of what importance it is to the honour of themſelves, and their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, to have one man of ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence; not onely as a nouriſher of vertue in their Courts, or ſervice; but beſides for a reformed Standard, by which even the moſt humorous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons could not but have a reverend ambition to be tried, and approved currant. This I doe the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently affirm, becauſe it will be confeſſed by all men, that this one mans example, and perſonall reſpect, did not onely encourage Learning, and Honour in the Schooles, but brought the affection, and true uſe thereof both into the Court, and Camp. Nay more, even many Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen excellently learned amongſt us will not deny, but that they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to row, and ſteer their courſe in his wake. Beſides which honour of unequall nature, and education, his very waies in the world, did generally adde reputation to his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:169718:25"/>
Prince, and Country, by reſtoring amongſt us the ancient Majeſtie of noble, and true dealing: As a manly wiſdome, that can no more be weighed down, by any effeminate craft, than <hi>Hercules</hi> could be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by that contemptible Army of Dwarfs. This was it which, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I loved dearly in him, and ſtill ſhall be glad to honour in the great men of this time: I mean, that his heart and tongue went both one way, and ſo with every one that went with the Truth; as knowing no other kindred, partie, or end.</p>
            <p>Above all, he made the Religion he profeſſed, the firm Baſis of his life: For thls was his judgement (as he often told me) that our true-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe to the Reformed Religion in the beginning, brought Peace, Safetie, and Freedome to us; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, that the wiſeſt, and beſt way, was that of the famous <hi>William</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who never divided
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:169718:26"/>
the conſideration of Eſtate from the cauſe of Religion, nor gave that ſound party occaſion to be jealous, or diſtracted, upon any apparance of ſafety whatſoever; prudently reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that to temporize with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of our Faith, was but (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Sea-guls) a ſtrife, not to keep upright, but aloft upon the top of every billow: Which falſe-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to God and man, would in the end find it ſelf forſaken of both; as Sir <hi>Philip</hi> conceived. For to this active ſpirit of his, all depths of the Devill proved but ſhallow fords; he piercing into mens counſels, and ends, not by their words, oathes, or complements, all barren in that age, but by fathoming their hearts, and powers, by their deeds, and found no wiſdome where he found no courage, nor courage without wiſdome nor either without hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and truth. With which ſolid, and active reaches of his, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:169718:26"/>
he would have found, or made a way through all the traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, even of the moſt weak and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular times. But it pleaſed God in this decrepit age of the world, not to reſtore the image of her ancient vigour in him, otherwiſe than as in a lightning before death.</p>
            <p>Neither am I (for my part) ſo much in love with this life, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſo little in a better to come, as to complain of God for taking him, and ſuch like exorbitant worthyneſs from us: fit (as it were by an Oſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme) to be divided, and not incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated with our corruptions: yet for the ſincere affection I bear to my Prince, and Country, my prayer to God is, that this Worth, and Way may not fatally be buried with him; in reſpect, that both before his time, and ſince, experience hath publiſhed the uſuall diſcipline of greatnes to have been tender of it ſelf onely; making honour a triumph, or rather
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:169718:27"/>
trophy of deſire, ſet up in the eyes of Mankind, either to be worſhiped as Idols, or elſe as Rebels to periſh under her glorious oppreſſions. Notwithſtanding, when the pride of fleſh, and power of favour ſhall ceaſe in theſe by death, or diſgrace; what then hath time to regiſter, or fame to publiſh in theſe great mens names, that will not be offenſive, or infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to others? What Pen without blotting can write the ſtory of their deeds? Or what Herald blaze their Arms without a blemiſh? And as for their counſels and projects, when they come once to light, ſhall they not live as noyſome, and loathſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above ground, as their Authors carkaſſes lie in the grave? So as the return of ſuch greatnes to the world, and themſelves, can be but private reproach, publique ill example, and a fatall ſcorn to the Government they live in. Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> is none of this number; for the greatneſs
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:169718:27"/>
which he affected was built upon true Worth; eſteeming Fame more than Riches, and Noble actions far above Nobility it ſelf.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="4" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
            <p>ANd although he never was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, nor poſſeſſed of any fit ſtage for eminence to act upon, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by there is ſmall latitude left for comparing him with thoſe deceaſed Worthies, that to this day live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>envied in ſtory; Yet can I probably ſay, that if any ſupreme Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, or employment, might have ſhewed forth this Gentlemans Worth, the World ſhould have found him neither a mixt <hi>Lyſander,</hi> with unactive goodneſs to have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted indifferent Citizens; nor yet like that gallant Libertine <hi>Sylla,</hi> with
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:169718:28"/>
a tyrannizing hand, and ill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to have ordered the diſſolute people of <hi>Rome;</hi> much leſs with that unexperienced <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> to have refuſed, in the ſeat of Juſtice, to deale equally between friends and ſtrangers. So that as we ſay, the abſtract name of goodneſs is great, and generally currant; her nature hard to imitate, and diverſly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, according to Zones, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, or education; admired by her enemies, yet ill followed by her friends: So I may well ſay, that this Gentlemans large, yet uniform diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was every where praiſed; greater in himſelf than in the world; yet greater there in fame and honour than many of his ſuperiors; reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by forrain Nations in one form, of his own in another; eaſily cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, hardly imitated; and therefore no received Standard at home, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his induſtry, judgement, and affections, perchance ſeemed too
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:169718:28"/>
great for the cautious wiſdomes of little Monarchies to be ſafe in. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, whoſoever will be pleaſed indifferently to weigh his life, actions, intentions, and death, ſhall find he had ſo ſweetly yoaked fame and conſcience together in a large heart; as inequality of worth, or place in him, could not have been other than humble obedience, even to a petty Tyrant of <hi>Sicily.</hi> Beſides, this ingenuitie of his nature did ſpread it ſelf ſo freely abroad, as who lives that can ſay he ever did him harm; whereas there be many li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that may thankfully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he did them good? Neither was this in him a private, but a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique affection; his chief ends being not Friends, Wife, Children, or him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but above all things the honour of his Maker, and ſervice of his Prince, or Country.</p>
            <p>Now though his ſhort life, and private fortune, were (as I ſayd) no
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:169718:29"/>
proper ſtages to act any greatneſs of good, or evill upon; yet are there (even from theſe little centers of his) lines to be drawn, not Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall, or imaginary, but reall linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but ſuch as infancy is of mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtate; out of which nature often ſparkleth brighter rayes in ſome, than ordinarily appear in the ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of many others. For proof wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I will paſs from the teſtimonie of brave mens words, to his own deeds. What lights of ſounder wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome can we aſcribe to our greateſt men of affairs than he ſhewed in his youth, and firſt employment, when he was ſent by the late <hi>Queen</hi> of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous memory, to condole the death of <hi>Maximilian,</hi> and congratulate the ſucceſſion of <hi>Rodolph</hi> to the Empire? For under the ſhaddow of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement between Princes, which ſorted better with his youth than his ſpirit, Did he not, to improve that journey, and make it a reall ſervice
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:169718:29"/>
to the Empire? For under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of this complement between Princes, which ſorted better with his youth than his ſpirit, did he not, to improve that journey, and make it a real ſervice to his Soveraign, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure an Article to be added to his Inſtructions, which gave him ſcope (as he paſſed) to ſalute ſuch <hi>German</hi> Princes, as were intereſted in the cauſe of our Religion, or their own native liberty?</p>
            <p>And though to negotiate with that long-breathed Nation proves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a work in ſteel, where many ſtroaks hardly leave any print; yet did this Maſter <hi>Genius</hi> quickly ſtir up their cautious, and ſlow judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be ſenſible of the danger which threatned them hourely, by this fatall conjunction of <hi>Rome</hi>'s un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining ſuperſtitions, with the commanding forces of <hi>Spain.</hi> And when he had once awaked that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Nation to look up, he as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169718:30"/>
made manifeſt unto them, that neither their inland ſeat, vaſt multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, confuſed ſtrength, wealth, nor hollow-ſounding Fame could ſecure their Dominions from the ambition of this brave aſpiring Empire; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever by the like helps they had formerly bounded the ſame Roman, and Auſtrian ſupremacies. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he alleged were, becauſe the manner of their conjunction was not like the ancient undertakers, who made open war by Proclamation; but craftily (from the infuſion of <hi>Rome)</hi> to enter firſt by inviſible traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique of ſouls; filling peoples minds with apparitions of holines, ſpecious Rites, Saints, Miracles, inſtitutions of new Orders, reformations of old, bleſſings of Catholiques, curſings of Heretiques, Thunder bolts of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication under the authority of their Mother Church. And when by theſe ſhadows they had gotten poſſeſſion of the weak, diſcouraged
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:169718:30"/>
the ſtrong, divided the doubtful, and finely lulled inferior powers aſleep; as the ancient Romans were wont to tame forrain nations with the name <hi>Socij;</hi> then to follow on with the Spaniſh, leſs ſpirituall, but more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Engines, <hi>viz.</hi> practice, confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, faction, money, treaties, leagues of traſſique, alliance by marriages, charge of rebellion, war, and all other acts of advantagious power.</p>
            <p>Laſtly he recalled to their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, how by this brotherhood in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill (like <hi>Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Levi) Rome</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> had ſpilt ſo much bloud, as they were juſtly become the terror of all Governments; and could now be withſtood, or ballanced by no other means, than a general league in Religion: Conſtantly and truely affirming, that to aſſociate by an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niform bond of conſcience, for the protection (as I ſaid) of Religion, and Liberty, would prove a more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid union, and ſymbolize far better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:169718:31"/>
their Tyrannies, than any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious combination in policy, league of ſtate, or other traffique of Civill, or Martial humors poſſibly could do.</p>
            <p>To this end did that undertaking ſpirit lay, or at leaſt revive the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a league between us, and the <hi>German</hi> Princes, which continues firme to this day: The defenſive part whereof hath hitherto helped to ſuport the ruines of our Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and diverted her enemies from the ancient ways of hoſtility, unto their <hi>Conclave,</hi> and modern un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining Arts. So, that if the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive part thereof had been as well proſecuted in that true path, which this young <hi>Genius</hi> trod out to us; both the paſſage for other Princes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Alps,</hi> would have been by this time more eaſie than <hi>Hanibal</hi>'s was; and beſides, the firſt ſound of that Drum might happily have reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thoſe petty dividing Schiſmes which reign amongſt us; not as
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:169718:31"/>
ſprung from any difference of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Faith, but miſty Opinion; and accordingly moulded firſt upon the Desks of buſie idle Lecturers, then blown abroad to our diſadvantage by a ſwarm of Popiſh Inſtruments, rather Jeſuits than Chriſtians; and to their ends moſt dangerouſly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpreading the world, for want of a confident Moderator. This (I ſay) was the firſt prize which did enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe this Maſter Spirit into the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and affairs of State.</p>

            <p>THe next doubtfull Stage hee had to act upon (howſoever it may ſeem private) was grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a publique and ſpecious propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of marriage, between the late famous Queen, and the Duke of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iou,</hi> With which Current, although he ſaw the great, and wiſe men of the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:169718:32"/>
time ſuddainly carryed down, and every one fiſhing to catch the Queens humor in it; yet when he conſidered the difference of years, perſon, edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſtate, and religion between them; and then called to minde the ſucceſs of our former alliances with the <hi>French:</hi> he found many reaſons to make queſtion whether it would prove Poetical, or reall on their part? And if reall; yet whether the ballance ſwayed not unequally, by adding much to them, and little to his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign? The Dukes greatneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely name, and poſſibility; and both theſe either to wither, or be maintained at her coſt. Her ſtate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in hand; and though Royally ſufficient to ſatisfie that Queens Princely and moderate deſires, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, yet perchance inferior to bear out thoſe mixt deſignes, into which his ambition, or neceſſities might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, or draw her.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the marriage of K. <hi>Philip,</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:169718:32"/>
to Q. <hi>Mary</hi> her ſiſter, was yet ſo freſh in memory, with the many inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of it, as by comparing and paralleling theſe together, he found credible inſtances to conclude, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe forrain alliances could prove ſafe for this Kingdom. Becauſe in her marriage with <hi>Spain,</hi> though both Princes continuing under the obedience of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their conſciences, nor their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples could ſuffer any fear of tumult, or imputation by change of faith; Yet was the winning of St. <hi>Quintins,</hi> with the loſs of <hi>Calice,</hi> and the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying away of our money to forrain ends, odious univerſally; the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> pride incompatible; their advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious delayes ſuſpicious; and their ſhort reign here felt to be a kinde of exhauſting tax upon the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Beſides, he diſcerned how this great Monarch countenanced with our Forces by ſea, and land, might, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:169718:33"/>
did uſe this addition of her ſtrength to transform his Low-Countrey Dukedomes, fall'n to him by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, into the nature of a ſoveraign conqueſt; and ſo by conjoyning their Dominion, and Forces by Sea, to his large Empires, and Armies upon the Mayn, would probably enforce all abſolute Princes to acknowledg ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to him before their time. And for our Kingdome, beſides that this King then meant to uſe it as a forge, to faſhion all his ſoveraign deſignes in; had he not (except ſome bely him) a fore-running hand in the change of Religion after King <hi>Edwards</hi> death? And had he not (even in that change) ſo maſtered us in our own Church, by his Chaplain and Conclave of <hi>Rome,</hi> that both theſe carried all their courſes byaced to his ends, as to an elder brother, who had more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant degrees of wealth, and honour to return them? ſo as every body (that devoted Queen excepted) fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:169718:33"/>
we muſt ſuddenly have been compelled to wear his livery, and ſerve his ends; or elſe to live like children neglected, or disfavoured by our holy Mother.</p>
            <p>Again, for our temporall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; was not his influence (except report belie him) as well in paſſing many ſharp lawes, and heavy execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them with more ſtrange Councels; as faſhioning our leagues both of peace, and traffique to his conquering ends? All theſe together, with that Maſter prize of his play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when under colour of piety, he ſtirred up in that wel-affected Queen a purpoſe of reſtoring thoſe tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities to the Church, which by the fall of Abbies, were long before di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed among the Nobility, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and people of this Kingdome: all theſe (as he ſaid) did clearly ſhew, that this ambitious King had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of moulding us to his uſe, even by diſtracting us amongſt our ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:169718:34"/>
Nevertheleſſe, to give him the honor of worldly wiſedom, I dare aver, he had no hope of bringing theſe curious aſſumptions to paſs; but rather did caſt them out, as ſounding lines, to fathome the depths of peoples mindes; and with particular fear, and diſtraction in the owners, to raiſe a generall diſtaſt in all men againſt the Government. Now, if we may judge the future by what is paſt, his ſcope in all theſe particulars could be no other, but when our inward waters had been throughly troubled, then to poſſeſs this diverſly diſeas'd Eſtate with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain poëticall titles of his own, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed long before, and ſince publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Dolman,</hi> to the end, that under the ſhadow of ſuch clouds, he might work upon the next heir; and ſo caſt a chance for all our goodes, lives, and liberties with little interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Theſe, and ſuch like, were the groundes which moved Sir <hi>Philip</hi> to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:169718:34"/>
compare the paſt, and preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of our Marriage with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe Crowns together.</p>
            <p>And though in danger of ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he did confeſs our aliance with the French to be leſſe unequall; yet even in that, he foreſaw, diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of Religion would firſt give ſcandall to both; and in progreſs, prove fatall of neceſſity to one ſide. Becauſe the weaker ſect here, being fortified by ſtrong parties abroad, and a husbands name at home, muſt neceſſarily have brought the native Soveraign under a kinde of Covert Baron, and thereby forced her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, either to loſe the freedom, and conſcience of a good Chriſtian, the honor of an excellent Prince, or the private reputation of obedient Wife. Neither could that excellent Lady (as he, and that time conceived) with theſe, or any other cautions, have countermined the mines of practice, whereby (it is probable)
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:169718:35"/>
this Prince would have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſteal change of Religion into her Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As firſt, by cavelling at the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and Fathers that upheld her Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Then by diſgracing her moſt zealous Miniſters, through aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions caſt upon their perſons, and advancing indifferent ſpirits, whoſe God is this world, the Court their heaven, and conſequently their ends, to biace Gods immortall truth to the fantaſies of mortall Princes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By the ſubtile latitude of ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinctions, publiquely edging nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the holy mother Church; and therein firſt waving, then ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the peoples mindes; if not with abrupt, and ſpirit-fall'n tolleration, yet with that inviſible web of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivencie, which is a ſnare to entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle great, or little flies, at the will of power.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By a Princely licentiouſneſſe in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169718:35"/>
behaviour, and conference, faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning atheiſme among her Subjects: as knowing that in confuſion of thoughts, he might the more eaſilie raiſe up ſuperſtitious idolatry: which crafty Image of his, with all the nice lineaments belonging to it, was the more credible, in reſpect the French have ſcornfully affirm'd one chief branch of our Princes prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives to be, the carying of their peoples conſciences which way they liſt. An abſoluteneſs the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to their ſubjects freedom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they bring theſe changes to paſs (as the French ſay) under the ſafe conduct of our earth-cy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law; and thereby make change legally ſafe, and conſtancie in the truth exceeding dangerous.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By a publique decrying of our ancient Cuſtomes, and Statutes; and from that ground, giving Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a Royall vigor in moulding of pleas, pulpits and Parliaments, after
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:169718:36"/>
the pattern of their own, and ſome other forain Nations; which in our Government is a confuſion, almoſt as fatall as the confuſion of tongues.</p>
            <p n="6">6. By employing no inſtruments among the people, but ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe to ſheer them with taxes, ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome them with fines, draw in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage under colour of obedience, and (like Frenchified <hi>Empſons,</hi> and <hi>Dudlies)</hi> bring the Engliſh peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the povertie of the French Peaſants, onely to fill up a <hi>Danaus</hi> ſive of prodigality, and thereby to ſecure the old age of Tyranny from that which is never old: I mean, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of popular inundations.</p>
            <p n="7">7. To lift up Monarchie above her ancient legall Circles, by baniſhing all free ſpirits, and faithfull Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, with a kinde of ſhaddowed O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraciſme, till the <hi>Ideas</hi> of native freedom ſhould be utterly forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and then (by the pattern of their own Duke of <hi>Guiſe)</hi> ſo to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage

ſame ſect to multiply here at home, till ſhe ſhould too late diſcover a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, either of changing her faith, hazarding her Crown, or at leaſt holding it at the joint courteſie of that ambitious Roman Conclave, or encreaſing Monarchie of <hi>Spain.</hi> A Scepter, and Miter, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction bringes forth boundleſs freedom to themſelves, and begets a narrow ſervitude upon all other Nations, that by ſurpriſe of wit, or power become ſubject to them.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Beſides, in the practice of this Marriage, he foreſaw, and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, that the very firſt breach of Gods ordinance, in matching her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a Prince of a diverſe faith, would infallibly carry with it ſome piece of the rending deſtiny, which <hi>Solomon,</hi> and thoſe other Princes juſtly felt, for having ventured to weigh the immortall wiſdom in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſcales, with mortall convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or inconveniency.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:169718:37"/>
10. The next ſtep muſt infallibly have been (as he conceived) with our ſhipping to diſturb or belea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> by Sea, under colour, or pretence of honor unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably taken, even when the horſe and foot of <hi>France</hi> ſhould threaten their ſubſiſtence by land; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (in this period of extremity) conſtrain that active people to run headlong into one of theſe three deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate courſes, <hi>viz.</hi> Either to fly for protection to the Flower-de-Luce, with whom they join in continent; Or precipitately ſubmit their necks to the yoking Cittadells of <hi>Spain,</hi> againſt whoſe inquiſitions, and uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations upon their Conſciences, and Liberties, ſo much money, and bloud had been ſhed, and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med already; Or elſe unnaturally to turn Pirates, and ſo become enemies to that trade, by which they and their friends have reciprocally got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and given ſo much proſperity.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:169718:38"/>
The choice or compariſon of which miſchiefes to them, and us, he brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid before me, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that if they ſhould incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate with <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Netherlands</hi> manufactures, induſtry, trade, and ſhipping, would add much to that Monarchie, both in peace, and war: The naturall riches of the French having been hitherto either kept barrain at home, or barrainly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported abroad, for lack of the true uſe of trade, ſhipping, exchange, and ſuch other myſteries as multiply native wealth; by improving their man-hood at home, and giving formes both to domeſtique, and forrain materialls; which defect (as he ſaid) being now abundantly to be ſupplied, by this conjunction with the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> would in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time, not onely puff up that active Common-wealth with unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et pride, but awake the ſtirring
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:169718:38"/>
French to feel this addition to their own ſtrengths; and ſo make them become dangerous neighbours by incurſion in invaſion to the Baltique Sea; many waies prejudice to the mutuall traffique between <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Germans,</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently a terror to all others, that by land, or Sea confine upon them, yea and apt enough once in a year, to try their fortune with that grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Monarch of <hi>Spain,</hi> for his Indian treaſure.</p>
            <p>2. On the other ſide; if any ſtricter league ſhould come to paſs between thoſe adventurous French Spirits, and the ſolid counſells of <hi>Spaine;</hi> and ſo through fear, ſcorn, or any other deſperate apparances force the <hi>Netherlands</hi> into a precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, but ſteady ſubjection of that Spaniſh Monarchie; then he willed me to obſerve, how this fearfull uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Earth, and Sea, having eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the petty Monarches of <hi>Europe,</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:169718:39"/>
would in all probability, coſtrain them to play after-games for their own Eſtates. Becauſe theſe two po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Navies (his and the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s) being thus added to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Armies by land, would ſoon (as he thought) compell that head of holy mother Church, whoſe beſt uſe for many yeares had been (by ballancing theſe two Emperiall greatneſses one with another) to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure inferior Princes: would (as I ſaid) ſoon enforce that ſacred Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-head to ſhelter her ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wings of this Emperiall Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and ſo abſolutely quit her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſupremacie; or at leaſt become Chaplain to this ſuppreſſing, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Conqueror.</p>
            <p>Beſides, in this fatall probability he diſcovered the great difference between the wiſdom of quiet Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in their moderate deſires of ſubſiſtence, from the large, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous counſells of undertaking
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:169718:39"/>
Monarches; whoſe ends are onely to make force the umpier of right, and by that inequality become Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lords (without any other ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle) over equalls and inferiors.</p>
            <p>3. Now for this third point, of conſtraining this oppreſſed, yet active <hi>Netherland</hi> people to become Pirates: he willed me in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of time paſt to obſerve, how much <hi>Scirpalus</hi> did among the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians; <hi>Sextus Pompeius</hi> the Romans, even in their greatneſs; and in themodern, <hi>Fluſhiug, Dunkerk, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell</hi> and <hi>Algiers.</hi> Inferring with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that this people, which had ſo long proſpered upon the rich mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialls of all Nations, by the two large ſpreading armes of manufacture, and traffique, could not poſſibly be forced at once to leave this habit: but would rather deſperately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to maintain theſe enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrengthes of marriners, ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſhipping of their own, with
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:169718:40"/>
becomming a Rende-vous for the ſwarm of diſcontented ſubjects uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally; inviting them with hope of ſpoil, and by that inheritance, to try whether the world were ready to examine her old foundations of freedom, in the ſpecious, and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring regions of change, and Powers encrochments?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, beſides this uneven ballance of State; the very reflexion of ſcorn between age, and youth; her come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, his diſadvantage that way; the exceſſive charge by continuall reſort of the French hither; danger of change for the worſe; her reall native States and riches made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to forrain humors; little hope of ſucceſſion, and if any, then <hi>France</hi> aſſured to become the ſeat, and <hi>England</hi> the Province; children, or no children, misfortune, or uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty: Theſe (I ſay) and ſuch like threatning probabilities made him joyn with the weaker party, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:169718:40"/>
oppoſe this torrent; even while the French faction reigning had caſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions upon his Uncle of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and made him, like a wiſe man (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of taking phyſick) volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily become priſoner in his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>

            <p>THus ſtood the ſtate of things then: And if any judicious Reader ſhall aſk, Whether it were not an error, and a dangerous one, for Sir <hi>Philip</hi> being neither Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate nor Counſellor, to oppoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt his Soveraigns pleaſure in things indifferent? I muſt anſwer, That his worth, truth, favour, and ſincerity of heart, together with his reall manner of proceeding in it, were his privileges. Becauſe this Gentlemans courſe in this great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:169718:41"/>
was, not by murmur among e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals, or inferiours, to detract from Princes; or by a mutinous kind of bemoaning error, to ſtir up ill affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in their minds, whoſe beſt thoughts could do him no good; but by a due addreſs of his humble rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the <hi>Queen</hi> her ſelf, to whom the appeal was proper. So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he found a ſweet ſtream of Soveraign humors in that well-tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered Lady, to run againſt him, yet found he ſafety in her ſelf, againſt that ſelfneſs which appeared to threaten him in her: For this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly born and bred Princeſs was not (ſubject-like) apt to conſtrue things reverently done in the worſt ſenſe; but rather with the ſpirit of annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Greatneſs (as created to reign equally over frail and ſtrong) more deſirous to find waies to faſhion her people, than colours, or cauſes to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, to prove nothing can be
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:169718:41"/>
wiſe, that is not really honeſt; every man of that time, and conſequently of all times may know, that if he ſhould have uſed the ſame freedome among the Grandees of Court (their profeſſion being not commonly to diſpute Princes purpoſes for truths ſake, but ſecond their humours to govern their Kingdomes by them) he muſt infallibly have found Worth, Juſtice, and Duty lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with no other eyes but <hi>Lamia</hi>'s; and ſo have been ſtained by that reigning faction, which in all Courts allows no faith currant to a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, that hath not paſt the ſeal of their practiſing corporation.</p>
            <p>Thus ſtood the Court at that time; and thus ſtood this ingenuous ſpirit in it. If dangerouſly in mens opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions who are curious of the preſent, and in it rather to doe craftily, than well: Yet, I ſay, that Princely heart of hers was a Sanctuary unto him; And as for the people, in whom ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:169718:42"/>
times the laſting images of Worth are preferred before the temporary viſions of art, or favour, he could not fear to ſuffer any thing there, which would not prove a kind of Trophy to him. So that howſoever he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtand alone, yet he ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; kept his acceſs to her Majeſty as before; a liberall converſation with the <hi>French,</hi> reverenced amongſt the worthieſt of them for himſelfe, and born in too ſtrong a fortification of nature for the leſs worthy to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bord, either with queſtion, familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or ſcorn.</p>
            <p>In this freedome, even while the greateſt ſpirits, and Eſtates ſeemed hood-winkt, or blind; and the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior ſort of men made captive by hope, fear, ignorance; did he enjoy the freedome of his thoughts, with all recreations worthy of them.</p>
            <p>And in this freedome of heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one day at Tennis, a Peer of this Realm, born great, greater by alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:169718:42"/>
and ſuperlative in the Princes favour, abruptly came into the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis-Court; and ſpeaking out of theſe three paramount authorities, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to entreat that, which he could not legally command. When by the encounter of a ſteady object, finding unreſpectiveneſs in himſelf (though a great Lord) not reſpected by this Princely ſpirit, he grew to expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late more roughly. The returns of which ſtile comming ſtill from an underſtanding heart, that knew what was due to it ſelf, and what it ought to others, ſeemed (through the miſts of my Lords paſſions, ſwoln with the winde of his faction then reigning) to provoke in yeelding. Whereby, the leſſe amazement, or confuſion of thoughts he ſtirred up in Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> the more ſhadowes this great Lords own mind was poſſeſſed with: till at laſt with rage (which is ever ill-diſciplin'd) he commands them to depart the Court. To this
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:169718:43"/>
Sir <hi>Philip</hi> temperately anſwers; that if his Lordſhip had been pleaſed to expreſs deſire in milder Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, perchance he might have led out thoſe, that he ſhould now find would not be driven out with any ſcourge of fury. This anſwer (like a Bellows) blowing up the ſparks of exceſs already kindled, made my Lord ſcornfully call Sir <hi>Philip</hi> by the name of Puppy. In which progreſs of heat, as the tempeſt grew more and more vehement within, ſo did their hearts breath out their perturbations in a more loud and ſhrill accent. The <hi>French</hi> Commiſſioners unfortunately had that day audience, in thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Galleries, whoſe windows look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Tennis-Court. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly drew all to this tumult: eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſort of quarrels ſorting well with their humors, eſpecially this. Which Sir <hi>Philip</hi> perceiving, and riſing with inward ſtrength, by the proſpect of a mighty faction againſt him; asked
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:169718:43"/>
my Lord, with a loud voice, that which he heard clearly enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Who (like an Echo, that ſtill multiplies by reflexions) repeated this Epithet of Puppy the ſecond time. Sir <hi>Philip</hi> reſolving in one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to conclude both the attentive hearers, and paſſionate actor, gave my Lord a Lie, impoſſible (as he aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) to be retorted; in reſpect all the world knows, Puppies are gotten by Dogs, and Children by men.</p>
            <p>Hereupon thoſe glorious inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Fortune in his Lordſhip were put to a kinde of pauſe, by a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inequality of nature in this Gentleman. So that they both ſtood ſilent a while, like a dumb ſhew in a Tragedy; till Sir <hi>Philip</hi> ſenſible of his own wrong, the forrain, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious ſpirits that attended; and yet, even in this queſtion between him, and his ſuperior, tender to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries honour; with ſome words of ſharp accent, led the way abruptly
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:169718:44"/>
out of the Tennis-Court; as if ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected an accident were not fit to be decided any farther in that place. Whereof the great Lord making a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſenſe, continues his play, without any advantage of reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as by the ſtandard of humours in thoſe times it was conceived.</p>
            <p>A day Sr <hi>Philip</hi> remains in ſuſpenſe, when hearing nothing of, or from the Lord, he ſends a Gentleman of worth to awake him out of his trance; wherein the <hi>French</hi> would aſſuredly think any pauſe, if not death, yet a lethargy of true honour in both. This ſtirred a reſolution in his Lordſhip to ſend Sir <hi>Philip</hi> a Challenge. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, theſe thoughts in the great Lord wandred ſo long between glory, anger, and inequality of ſtate, as the Lords of her Majeſties Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell took notice of the differences, commanded peace, and laboured a reconciliation between them. But needleſly in one reſpect, and boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:169718:44"/>
in another. The great Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as it ſhould ſeem) either not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to adventure many inequalities againſt one, or inwardly ſatisfied with the progreſs of his own Acts: Sir <hi>Philip</hi> on the other ſide confident, he neither had nor would loſe, or let fall any thing of his right. Which her Majeſties Counſell quickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, recommended this work to her ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Queen, who ſaw that by the loſs, or diſgrace of either, ſhe could gain nothing, preſently undertakes Sir <hi>Philip;</hi> and (like an excellent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch) lays before him the difference in degree between Earls, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; the reſpect inferiors ought to their ſuperiors; and the neceſſity in Princes to maintain their own crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as degrees deſcending between the peoples licentiouſneſs, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted Soveraignty of Crowns: how the Gentlemans neglect of the Nobility taught the Peaſant to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult upon both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:169718:45"/>
Whereunto Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> with ſuch reverence as became him, replyed: Firſt, that place was never intended for privilege to wrong: witneſs her ſelf, who how Soveraign ſoever ſhe were by Throne, Birth, Education, and Nature; yet was ſhe content to caſt her own affections into the ſame moulds her Subjects did, and govern all her rights by their Laws. Again, he beſought her Majeſty to conſider, that although he were a great Lord by birth, alliance, and grace; yet hee was no Lord over him: and therfore the difference of degrees between free men, could not challenge any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther homage than precedency. And by her Fathers Act (to make a Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſdom become the more famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar) he did inſtance the Government of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, who gave the Gentry free, and ſafe appeal to his feet, againſt the oppreſſion of the Grandees; and found it wiſdome, by the ſtronger corporation in number,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:169718:45"/>
to keep down the greater in power: inferring elſe, that if they ſhould u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, the over-grown might be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by ſtill coveting more, to fall (as the Angels did) by affecting equality with their Maker.</p>
            <p>This conſtant tenor of truth he took upon him; which as a chief duty in all creatures, both to themſelves, &amp; the ſoveraignty above them, protected this Gentleman (though he obeyed not) from the diſpleaſure of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign. Wherein he left an authentical preſident to after ages, that howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tyrants allow of no ſcope, ſtamp, or ſtandard, but their own will; yet w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Princes there is a latitude for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to reſerve native, &amp; legall free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by paying hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble tribute in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, though not in matter, to them.</p>

            <p>THE next ſtep which he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the world, was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition

I mean the laſt employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but one of Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> to the Weſt Indies. Which journey, as the ſcope of it was mixt both of ſea, and land ſervice; ſo had it according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinct Officers, &amp; Commanders, choſen by Sir <hi>Philip</hi> out of the ableſt Governors of thoſe Martiall times. The project was contrived between themſelves in this manner; that both ſhould equally be Governours, when they had left the ſhore of <hi>England;</hi> but while things were a preparing at home, Sir <hi>Fran.</hi> was to bear the name, and by the credit of Sir <hi>Phil.</hi> have all particulars abundantly ſupplyed.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of which ſecret carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was, the impoſſibility for Sir <hi>Philip</hi> to win the Queen, or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (out of the value which they rated his worth at) to diſpenſe with an employment for him ſo remote
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:169718:46"/>
and of ſo hazardous a nature. Beſides his credit, and reputation with the State lay not that way. So as our provident Magiſtrates expecting a Prentiſhip more ſeriouſly in Martial, than Mechanical actions; and therein meaſuring all men by one rule; would (as Sir <hi>Philip</hi> thought) not eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his unexperience equall for a deſigne of ſo many divers, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous paſſages: howſoever wiſe men, even in the moſt active times have determined this art of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be rather a riches of nature, than any proper fruit of induſtry, or education. This (as I ſaid) was one reaſon, why Sir <hi>Philip</hi> did cover that glorious enterprize with a cloud. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other was, becauſe in the doing, while it paſt unknown, he knew it would paſs without interruption; and when it was done, preſumed the ſucceſs would put envy and all her agents to ſilence.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide Sir <hi>Francis</hi> found
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:169718:47"/>
that Sir <hi>Philip</hi>'s friends, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his excellent inward pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, would add both weight, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion to his ambition; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently either with, or without Sir <hi>Philip</hi>'s company, yeeld unexpected eaſe, and honor to him in this voiage.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe two divers Counſels they treat confidently together; the preparations go on with a large hand amongſt our Governors; nothing is denyed Sir <hi>Francis</hi> that both their propounding hearts could demand. To make which expedition of leſs difficulty, they kept the particular of this plot more ſecret than it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to keep the generall preparations of ſo great a journey; hoping that while the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſhould be forced to arm every where againſt them, he could not any where be ſo royally provided to defend himſelf, but they might land without any great impediment.</p>
            <p>In theſe termes Sir <hi>Francis</hi> departs
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:169718:47"/>
from <hi>Plimouth</hi> with his ſhips; vowed and reſolved that when he ſtaid for nothing but for a wind, the watch word ſhould come poſt for Sir <hi>Philip.</hi> The time of the year made haſte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, &amp; Sr <hi>Francis</hi> to follow it, either made more haſte than needed, or at leaſt ſeemed to make more than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally he did. Notwithſtanding, as I dare aver that in his own element he was induſtrous; ſo dare I not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn his affections in this miſpriſion of time. Howſoever a letter comes poſt for Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> as if the whole fleet ſtayed onely for him, and the wind. In the mean-ſeaſon the State hath intelligence that <hi>Don Antonio</hi> was at ſea for <hi>England,</hi> and reſolved to land at <hi>Plimouth.</hi> Sir <hi>Philip</hi> turning occaſion into wiſdome, puts himſelf into the imployment of conducting up this King; and under that veil leaves the Court without ſuſpicion; over-ſhoots his father-in-law then Secretary of Eſtate in his own bow;

            <p>Yet I that had the honor as of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bred with hm from his youth; ſo now (by his own choice of all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi> to be his loving, and beloved <hi>Achates</hi> in this journey, obſerving the countenance of this gallant ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner more exactly than Sir <hi>Philips</hi> leiſure ſerved him to doe; after we were laid in bed, acquainted him with my obſervation of the diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and depreſſion which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in Sir <hi>Francis;</hi> as if our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were both beyond his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deſire. Nevertheleſſe that ingenuous ſpirit of Sir <hi>Philip</hi>'s, though apt to give me credit, yet not apt to diſcredit others, made him ſuſpend his own, &amp; labor to change, or qualifie my judgement; Till with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome few daies after, finding the ſhippes neither ready according to

            <p>All this whlie <hi>Don Antonio</hi> landes not; the fleet ſeemed to us (like the weary paſſengers Inn) ſtill to goe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from our deſires; letters came from the Court to haſten it away: it may be the leaden feet, and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thoughts of Sir <hi>Francis</hi> wrought in the day, and unwrought by night; while he watched an opportunity to diſcover us, without being diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

               <hi>Mercury,</hi> this errand being partly advertiſed to Sir <hi>Philip</hi> beforehand, was intercepted upon the way; his letters taken from him by two reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſouldiers in Marriners apparell; brought inſtantly to Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and read. The contents as welcome as Bulls of excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the ſuperſtitious Romaniſt, when they enjoyn him either to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his right, or his holy Mother-Church, yet did he ſit this firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, without noiſe, or anſwer.</p>
            <p>The next was a more Imperiall Mandate, carefully conveyed, and delivered to himſelf by a Peer of this Realm; carrying with it in the one hand grace, the other thunder. The grace was an offer of an inſtant imployment under his Unckle, then going Generall into the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; Againſt which although he would gladly havedemurred; yet the confluence of reaſon, tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie of Power, fear of ſtaying the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:169718:49"/>
whole Fleet, made him inſtantly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifiſe all theſe ſalfe places to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of obedience.</p>
            <p>Wherein how unwillingly ſoever he yeelded up his knowledge, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, publique and private endes in that journey; yet did he act this force in a gallant faſhion.

            <p>Nevertheleſſe as the Limmes of

            <p>Whereupon, when Sir <hi>Philip</hi> found this, and many other of his large, and ſincere reſolutions impriſoned within the pleights of their fortunes, that mixed good, and evill together unequally; and withall diſcerned, how the idle-cenſuring faction at home had won ground of the active adventures abroad; then did this double depreſſion both of things, and men, lift up his active ſpirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

an univerſall proſpect of time, States, and things: and in them made him conſider, what impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity there was for him, that had no delight to reſt idle at home, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propounding ſome other forrain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, probable, and fit to invite that excellent Princeſſes minde, and moderate Government, to take hold off.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:169718:51"/>
made judges of danger which they fear, and honor which they underſtand not.</p>
            <p>The people (by diſpoſition of the clime) valiant, and multiplying, apt indifferently to corrupt with peace, or refine with action; and therefore to be kept from ruſt, or mutiny, by no meanes better than by forrain employments: His opinion being that <hi>Ilanders</hi> have the air and waters ſo diverſly moving about them, as neither peace, nor war, can long be welcome to their humors, which muſt therefore begovern'd by the active, and yet ſteady hand of authority. Beſides he obſerved the Sea to have ſo naturall a Sympathie, with the complexions of them ſhe invirons, as be it in traffique, pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, or war, they are indifferent to wander upon that element; and for the moſt part apter to follow under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking chance, than any ſetled endes in a Marchant-traffique.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:169718:51"/>
Now for the bleſſed <hi>Lady</hi> which then governed over us: how equall ſoever ſhe were in her happy creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for peace, or war, and her people (as I have ſhewed) humble to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her will in either, yet becauſe ſhe reſolved to keep within the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum</hi> of her ſex, ſhe ſhewed herſelf more ambitious of ballancing neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor Princcs from invading one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than under any pretence of title, or revenge, apt to queſtion or conquer upon forrain Princes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions. And though this moderate courſe carried her into a defenſive war, which commonly falls out ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be an impoveriſhing of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, than any meanes to enrich, or diſcipline their Eſtates, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it; yet could not all the rackes of loſs, injury, or terror, ſtir this excellent <hi>Lady</hi> into any further degree of offenſive war, than onely the keeping of her Navy abroad, to interrupt the ſafe-comming home of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:169718:52"/>
his <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet, and hinder the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, contracted for in all parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> to furniſh another invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Navy, wherewith he purpoſed to beſiege the world, and therein (as his firſt ſtep) her divided King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, in this ſurvay of forrain Nations, he obſerved a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall paſſiveneſſe generally currant, by reaſon of ſtrange inequalities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween little humors and great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in the preſent <hi>Princes</hi> reigning.</p>
            <p>Amongſt whom for the firſt object <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France</hi> appeares to him in the likeneſs of a good Maſter, rather than a great King; bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in his pleaſures, his Crown de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main exhauſted, impoſitions multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, the people light, the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty prone to move, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Country apt, through ſcorn of his effeminate Vices, either to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a prey for the ſtrongeſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker, or elſe to be Cantonized by
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:169718:52"/>
ſelf-diviſion. In both which poſſible diſaſters, their native wealth, and variety of objects, perchance have made both King, and people (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever confuſedly erring) yet to live ſecured by the providence of chance.</p>
            <p>Again, he ſaw the vaſt body of the Empire reſting (as in a dream) upon an immoveable centre of ſelf-great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and under this falſe aſſumpſit, to have laid the bridle on the neck of the Emperor, to work them arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially, with a gentle, or ſteady hand, to his own will.</p>
            <p>And to confirm, and multiply this clowdy danger, he diſcerned how that creeping Monarchie of <hi>Rome</hi> (hy her Arch-inſtruments the Ieſuits) had already planted fine Schooles of ſerving humanity in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of their reformed Cities: inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo to tempt this welbelieving people, with that old forbidden tree of knowledge, as they might ſin deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:169718:53"/>
againſt their own Eſtates, before they knew it.</p>
            <p>The like miſt theſe crafty-raiſers invented (as he thought) to caſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that well-united fabrick of the <hi>Hanſes:</hi> whoſe endes being meerly wealth, and their ſeats invironed on every ſide with active, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full neighbors, would (in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility) make them as jealous of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Princes in proſperity, as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in diſtreſs to ſeek protection under them. So that they being at this time grown mighty by combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, if they ſhould be neglected, would prove apt, and able to ſway the ballance unequally to the endes of the ſtronger.</p>
            <p>Beſides, he diſcerned yet a greater, and more malignant aſpect from that ſpreading Monarchie of <hi>Spain;</hi> which abſolutely commanding the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> governing the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave,</hi> and having gotten, or affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to get a commanding intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:169718:53"/>
over theſe Cities; would ſoon multiply unavoidable danger, both to themſelves, and us, by mixing the temporall, and ſpirituall ſword, to their crafty conquering ends.</p>
            <p>Nay more; how upon the ſame foundation they had begunne yet a more dangerous party, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the German Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; by adding to the fatall oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Religion between them, the hopes, feares, jealouſie, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of reward, or loſs, with all the unnaturall ſeeds of diviſion; which might make them, through theſe confuſed threatnings, and extice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to become an eaſie prey for the Spaniards watchfull, unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable, and much promiſing ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>He likewiſe obſerved, <hi>Battorie</hi> that gallant man, but dangerouſly aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring King of <hi>Poland,</hi> to be happily peiſed by the ancient competition between him, and his Nobility,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:169718:54"/>
and as buſie to encroch upon their Marches, and add more to his own limited Soveraignty, as they were to draw down thoſe few preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives it had, into that well mixt, and ballanced <hi>Ariſtocracie</hi> of theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Denmark,</hi> howſoever by the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and narrowneſs of his Sound, reſtrained to the ſelfneſs of profit; yet by diſcipline, and ſeat, able to ſecond an active undertaker with ſhipping, money, &amp;c. But too wiſe, with theſe ſtrengths to help any forrain Prince to become Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror over himſelf, or otherwiſe to entangle his Eſtate offenſively; or defenſively in common Actions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sweden</hi> environed, or rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned with great and dangerous neighbours, and enemies. The <hi>Polae</hi> pretending Title to his Kingdom, and with a continuall claim by ſword, inforceing him to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall defenſive charge. The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> being unſafe to him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

every occaſion, by ill neighbour-hood among active Princes. And laſtly, the barbarous <hi>Moſcovite,</hi> onely quiet through his own diſtreſſe, and oppreſſions elſe-where. So as like a Prince thus ſtrictly invironed, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> could not (among Princes) ſtand as any pregnant place of exorbitant help, or terror; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by money.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Switzers</hi> ſwoln with equality; divided at home; enemies, yet ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to Monarchies; not eaſily op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, in the opinion of thoſe times; nor able to doe any thing of note alone: and ſo a dangerous body for the ſoul of <hi>Spanie</hi> to infuſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes into.</p>
            <p>The Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> carefull to bind one another by common cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; reſtrained from the freedom of their own counſells, by force of ſtronger powers above them, and as buſie in keeping down their people, to multiply profit out of them, as to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:169718:55"/>
entiſe the ſtranger thither, to gain moderately by him. Through which narrow kind of wiſdom, they being become rather Merchant than Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchall States, were confined from challenging their own, or enlarging their dominions upon neighbors; and laſtly, in aſpect to other Princes rights, conjured within neutrall Circles, by the myſticall practiſe of an abuſing <hi>Conclave,</hi> and aſpiring Monarch of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Moſcovite</hi> bridled by his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous neighbor the <hi>Tartar;</hi> and through natural ignorance, and inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, like a poor Tenant upon a rich Farm, unequall to his inferiors.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Grand Signior</hi> aſleep in his <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglia;</hi> as having turned the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that growing Monarchy into idle luſt; corrupted his Martiall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline; prophaned his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> in making war againſt his own Church, and not in perſon, but by his <hi>Baſha's;</hi> conſequently by all apparance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:169718:55"/>
into his people by ſuch, but more precipitate degrees, as his active Anceſtors had climbed above them.</p>
            <p>Now while all theſe Princes lived thus fettered within the narrowneſs of their own Eſtates, or humors; <hi>Spain</hi> managing the <hi>Popedome</hi> by voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and penſions among the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, and having the ſword both by land, &amp; ſea in his hand; ſeemed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to have all thoſe Weſtern-parts of the world, laid as a <hi>Tabula raſa</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, to write where he pleaſed; <hi>Yo el Ré.</hi> And that which made this fatal proſpect the more probable, was his golden Indian Mines; kept open, not only to feed, and carry his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Fleets, &amp; Armies, where he had will, or right to goe; but to make way, and pretenſe for more, where he liſt, by corrupting, and terrifying the chief Counſels both of Chriſtian and Heathen Princes. Which tempting, and undermining courſe had already given ſuch reputation both to his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:169718:56"/>
and Martiall actions; that he was even then grown as impoſſible to pleaſe, as dangerous to offend.</p>
            <p>And out of which fearfull Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack this wakeful Patriot, beſides an univerſall terror upon all Princes, ſaw (as I ſaid) that this immenſe power of <hi>Spain</hi> did caſt a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular aſpect of danger upon his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Countrey: and ſuch as was not likely to be prevented, or ſecured by any other Antidote, than a generall league among free Princes, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this undertaker at home. To make this courſe plauſible, though he knew the Qu. of <hi>England</hi> had already engaged her fortunes into it, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting the States Generall, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving her Governours (as I ſaid) to ſit at home in their ſoft chairs, playing faſt or looſe with them that ventured their lives abroad; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently determined that while <hi>Spain</hi> had peace, a Pope, money, or credit; and the world men, neceſſity,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:169718:56"/>
or humors; the war could hardly be determined upon this Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey ſtage.</p>
            <p>Becauſe if the neighbour-hood of <hi>Flanders,</hi> with help of the ſuddain ſea paſſage, ſhould tempt theſe united Princes to fall upon that limb of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Empire; it would prove (as he ſuppoſed) an aſſailing of him in the ſtrongeſt ſeat of his war; where all exchanges, paſſages, and ſupplies were already ſetled to his beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: and ſo a force bent againſt him, even where himſelf could wiſh it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Flanders</hi> being a Province reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with offenſive, and defenſive Armies: and fortified with divers ſtrong Cities: of which the aſſailing Armies muſt be conſtrained, either to leave many behind them, or elſe to hazard the loſs of time, and their gallanteſt Troops in beſieging of one.</p>
            <p>Again he conceived that <hi>France</hi> it ſelf was like enough to be tender, in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:169718:57"/>
ſeconding our deſignes with horſe, or foot there; our neighbour-hood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame Continent (out of old acquaintance) not being over-wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to them, as he preſumed. And for ſuccors from other Princes; they were to come far, and paſs through divers dominions with difficulty, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, loſs of time, and perchance looſe-handed diſcipline.</p>
            <p>And ſo concludes, firſt, that it would be hard for us to become ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Maſters of the field in <hi>Flanders,</hi> or to ground our aſſailing of him there upon any other argument, than that ever-betraying <hi>Fallax</hi> of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing our enemies, or ſetling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking Counſels upon market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Intelligence, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaith the <hi>French</hi> in his time uſed to do. Which confident wayes, without any curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous examination what power the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe party hath prepared to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, by defenſe, invaſion, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, muſt probably make us loſers,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:169718:57"/>
both in men, money, and reputation. And upon theſe and the like aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits he reſolved, there were but two ways left to fruſtrate this ambitious Monarchs deſignes. The one, that which diverted <hi>Hanibal,</hi> and by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fire on his own houſe made him draw in his Spirits to comfort his heart; the other that of <hi>Iaſon</hi> by fetching away his golden Fleece, and not ſuffering any one man quietly to enjoy that, which every man ſo much affected.</p>

            <p>TO carry war into the bowels of <hi>Spain,</hi> and by the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> burn his ſhipping in all havens as they paſſed along; and in that paſſage ſurprize ſome well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choſen place for wealth, &amp; ſtrength: eaſie to be taken, and poſſible to be
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:169718:58"/>
kept by us: he ſuppoſed to be the ſafeſt, moſt quick, and honourable Counſell of diverſion. Becauſe the ſame ſtrength of ſhipping which was offenſively imployed to carry forces thither; and by the way to interrupt all Martiall preparations, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of that griping ſtate; might by the convenient diſtance between his Coaſt, &amp; ours (if the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſhould affect to pay us with our own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies) fitly be diſpoſed both wayes; and ſo like two arms of a naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (with little addition of charge) defend, and offend; ſpend and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply at one time.</p>
            <p>Or, if we found our own ſtock, or neighbours contribution ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to follow good ſucceſs to greater deſignes; then whether our adventure once more, in ſtirring up ſpirit in the <hi>Portugall</hi> againſt the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilians</hi> tyranny over them, were not to caſt a chance for the beſt part of his wealth, reputation, &amp; ſtrength, both
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:169718:58"/>
of men and ſhipping in all his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
            <p>Again, leſt the pride of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould be ſecretly ordain'd to ſcourge it ſelf, for having been a ſcourge to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and yet in this reall inquiſition e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape the audacity of undertaking Princes; Sir <hi>Philip</hi> thought fit to put the world in mind, that <hi>Sevill</hi> was a fair City; ſecure in a rich ſoyl, and plentiful traffique; but an effeminate kind of people, guarded with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering name; and conſequently a fair bait to the piercing eyes of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Generals, needy Souldiers, and greedy Mariners. In like ſort hee mentioned <hi>Cales,</hi> as a ſtrength, and key to her traffiquefull, &amp; navigable river, not fit to be neglected in ſuch a defenſive, and diverting enterpriſe, but at leaſt to be examined.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, whether this audacity of undertaking the conqueror at home; would not, with any moderate ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, raiſe up a new face of things in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:169718:59"/>
thoſe parts; and ſuddainly ſtir up many ſpirits, to move againſt the ſame power, under which they long have bin ſlaviſhly conjur'd, &amp; by this affront, prove a deforming blemiſh in the nice fortune of a fearfull uſurper?</p>
            <p>Or if that ſhall be thought an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking too full of charge, hazard, or difficulty; then whether it wil not be juſt in the wiſdome of Eſtate, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged among active Princes; that as Qu. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had ever been tender, in preſerving her Soveraignty upon the narrow ſeas; and wiſely conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, how nature, to maintain that birth-right of hers, had made all wars by ſea far more cheap, proper, and commodious to her, than any expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition upon land could poſſibly be: I ſay, whether to continue this claim, would not prove honour to her ſelf, advantage to her traffique, and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to her people; I mean, if ſhee ſhould pleaſe, in thoſe cloudy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, &amp; queſtions reigning between
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:169718:59"/>
her ſelf, and other Princes, to keep a ſtrong ſucceſſive fleet, all ſeaſonable times of the year, upon this pretty <hi>Sleeve,</hi> or <hi>Ocean</hi> of hers? I ſay, to keep them as provident ſurveyers what did paſſe from one ſtate to another, wherein the law of Nature, or Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had formerly given her intereſt to an offenſive, or defenſive ſecurity. A Regall inquiſition, and worthy of a ſea-Soveraign, without wronging friends, or neighbours, to have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect intelligence what they had, or wanted for delicacy, peace, or war in generall: And in particular, a clear perſpective glaſs into her enemies Merchant, or Martiall traffique, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling this Queen ſo to ballance this ambitious <hi>Leviathan</hi> in either kind; as the little fiſhes, his fellow Citizens, might travell, multiply, &amp; live quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by him under the protecton of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Again, let us conſider, whether out of this, or the like Audit, it will not
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:169718:60"/>
be found a juſt tribute to opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the rudder of all ſtate wiſedoms. That as Qu. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, which reſted with her ſex at home, and yet moved all ſexes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to their own good; whether (I ſay) as ſhe from a devoted zeal to the Church, had by Sir <hi>Nich. Throgmorton,</hi> in the beginning of her reign, ſtirred up ſpirits in that over-mitred <hi>French</hi> Kingdom, to become watchful guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of peace, and Religion there. I ſay, whether in the ſame Chriſtian providence there might not, by the neglect, or breach of many Treaties, an occaſion be juſtly taken to reap a reaſonable harveſt out of that well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choſen ſeed time, by receiving <hi>Rochel, Brest, Bourdeaux,</hi> or any other place upon that Continent, diſtreſſed for Religion, into her abſolute protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Nevertheleſs, not with intent of reconquering any part of her ancient Domanies, lineally deſcended from many anceſtors; howſoever thoſe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:169718:60"/>
places ſo taken may ſeem ſeated like tempters of Princes, to plead in the Court of <hi>Mars</hi> ſuch native, though diſcontinued rights, as no time can preſcribe againſt; but only to keep thoſe humble religious ſouls free from oppreſſion, in that ſuper-Jeſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſoveraignty.</p>
            <p>In which religious deſigne to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Qu. he adviſed us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine if the diverſions naturally ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing amongſt their unlimited <hi>French Grandees,</hi> grown up <hi>per ſaltum</hi> with their Kings above Laws, Parliaments, and Peoples freedom; would not in all probability caſt up ſom light duſt into their ſuperiors eys, as tributes to their common Idol <hi>Diſcorder;</hi> and ſo perchance either by treaty, or ſight of the firſt Army, ſtir up <hi>Bouillon,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi> for Religion; other Roytelets w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> hope to make ſafe their ſubaltern governments, even through the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of that over-ſoring ſoveraignty?</p>
            <p>And is not as probable again, that
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:169718:61"/>
even the greateſt Cities, raiſed and ſtanding upon the like waving en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of time, &amp; advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous power would readily become jealous of the leaſt ſtrict hand carried over them, by interruption of traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique, greedineſs of Governors, pride of their own wealth, or indefinite impoſitions; as <hi>Paris, Bourdeaux, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles, Roan,</hi> or <hi>Lyons?</hi> whereby they might likewiſe be tempted, either to run head-long with the ſtream, or at the leaſt to ſtand at gaze, and leave the Heraldry of Princes to be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the ſtronger party, as for the moſt part, they hitherto have been.</p>
            <p>Nay in this Climax to come nearer yet; is it probable that even the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Princes, and Provinces en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironing this vaſt Kingdome, would (as now they doe) for want of vent, break their hopes, and ſervilly run out upon the ground like water, and not rather when this new rent ſhould appear, chuſe to ſhake off a charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:169718:61"/>
&amp; ſervile yoke of Mountebank holineſs under <hi>Spaniſh Rome,</hi> and to that end preſently mingle money, counſels, and forces with ours? As quickly reſolved that this way of a ballancing union, amongſt abſolute Princes, would prove quieter reſt for them, and ſounder foundations for us, than our former parties did, when we conquered <hi>France,</hi> more by ſuch factious &amp; ambitious aſſiſtances, than by any odds of our Bows, or Beef-ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as the <hi>French</hi> were then ſcornful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleas'd to terme us: I ſay, even when in the pride of our conqueſts, we ſtrove to gripe more than was poſſible for us to hold; as appears by our being forced to come away, and leave our anceſtors bloud, and bones behind, for Monuments not of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but of over-griping &amp; expulſion.</p>
            <p>So that the ſum of all is; whether the taking or ſurprize of <hi>Cales, Rochel, Bourdeaux,</hi> or ſome ſuch other good out, or inlet upon that Mayn, offered, into our protection, would not prove
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:169718:62"/>
honour to us, as a brave earneſt either to war, or peace? Beneficiall to the <hi>French</hi> King, and Crown againſt their wills; as manifeſting to their hot ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and young Councels, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking is not all? And beſides clearly ſhewing, in <hi>Mars</hi> his true glaſs, how that once wel-formed Monarchy had by little, and little, let fal her ancient, and reverend pillars, (I mean Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Lawes, and Cuſtomes) into the narrowneſs of Proclamations, or Imperiall Mandates: by which like baſtard children of tyranny ſhe hath transformed her Gentry into Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, her Peaſants into ſlaves, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy into Sale works, Crown-reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue into Impoſitions. And therein likewiſe publiſhed the differences between Monarchs, and Tyrants ſo clearly to the world, as hereafter all Eſtates, that would take upon their necks the yoke of Tyranny, muſt juſtly be reputed voluntary ſlaves in the choice of that paſſive bondage.</p>
            <p>Whereby, one queſtion naturally
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:169718:62"/>
begetting another, the next (as I take it) muſt be what this Auſtrian aſpiring familie would doe, while theſe two Kingdoms ſhould ſtand thus engaged? Whether invade the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> alone, hoping by his ruine to ſubdue the yet ſubdued Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> to get the Sound, and Eaſtern Seas, with all their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime riches into his power: to bring the Hanſe Towns into ſome captivated ſubjections, and thereby become Soveraign over all <hi>Eaſtern</hi> traffique by Sea, and land? Or elſe by lulling <hi>France</hi> aſleep with Imperiall Matches, or promiſes, finde means to ſteal the Flower-de-luce into the Lyons garland; and in that currant of proſperity to Citadellize the long oppreſſed <hi>Netherlands</hi> into a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of uttermoſt bondage; and ſo build up his Eagles neſt above the threatning of any inferior Region.</p>
            <p>But it many times pleaſeth God by the breaking out of concealed flaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es from theſe fatall cloudes of craft,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:169718:63"/>
or violence, to awake even the moſt ſuperſtitious Princes out of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted dreams; and cauſe them to reſiſt ſuddainly to make head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this devouring <hi>Sultan,</hi> with leagues offenſive, and defenſive; And by an unexpected union to become ſuch frontier neighbours to this Crown-hunter, as he might with great reaſon doubt their trading up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his large cloven feet, who inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to have ſet them ſo heavily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heads of many more ancient States, Peoples, or Scepters than his own. And laſtly, in the ſame preſs, by this one affront in the Lions face, publiſhing to the world that power is infinite no where but in God: ſo as the firſt blow well ſtricken, moſt commonly ſucceeds with honor, and advantage to the judicious, able, and active undertakers.</p>
            <p>Out of which divine providence, governing all ſecond cauſes by the firſt, is it not probable that even the naturall viciſſitudes of war, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:169718:63"/>
peace, would bring forth ſome active propoſitions between theſe many waies allied Kingdomes of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> to a perfect reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and as many again of irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liable diviſion between them, and <hi>Spain? France</hi> being ſtirred up by a joint counſell, and propoſition of aſſiſtance, to the recovery of her long ſleeping rights in <hi>Navarre,</hi> or <hi>Naples;</hi> and <hi>England</hi> onely to diſtract this ambitious Monarch from his late Cuſtom, in depoſing Kings, and Princes, as <hi>Navarre, Portugall,</hi> the <hi>Palatine, Brunſwick,</hi> and &amp;c. as in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond courſe of his devouring glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, interrupt him from future pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> it ſelf, to the ſame end; with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant intent, to bring all the earth under one mans tyranny.</p>
            <p>To prevent which deluge of bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs power, Sir <hi>Philip</hi> was of opinion, that more than charge, it could be no prejudice; if to the unvizarding of this masked triplicity between
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:169718:64"/>
               <hi>Spain, Rome</hi> and the Soveraign Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its of <hi>France;</hi> I ſay if the <hi>Queen,</hi> as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendreſs of the faith, for a main pledg of this new offenſive, and defenſive undertaken league, would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to aſſiſt the French King with the ſame forces by Sea, or land, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, till then, ſhe had juſtly oppoſed againſt him. And conſequently put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spaniard from an offenſive, to a defenſive War, manifeſtly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and give credit to this unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that this Arch-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror never intended other favor to the Pope, Emperor, or Ieſuits, in all this conjunction, than <hi>Poliphemus</hi> promiſed to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> which was, that they ſhould be the laſt whom he purpoſed to devour.</p>
            <p>And farther to encourage theſe great Princes in this true balancing deſigne with the chargeable, and thorny paſſages proper to it; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently ſaw the long threatned Dutchie of <hi>Savoy</hi> would be in their view: with aſſurance that this active
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:169718:64"/>
Prince would think it a ſafe diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of dangers from his domeſticall Eſtate, and a fit ſtage to act his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain cobwebbs upon, if he might have them ſhadowed under the wings of ſtronger, and every way more able Powers; without which his mean Eſtate muſt in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity force him to ſhift his outward garments perchance too often.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> again, foreſeeing with their Ariſtocraticall jealouſie, that their Eſtate had onely two pregnant dangers hanging over it; the one Eaſtward from the grand Signior, who eaſily moves not his encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing half Moon; the other Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from this <hi>Solyman</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> whoſe unſatiable ambition, they knew, would reſt upon no centre, but creep along the Mediterranean Seas, till he might (contrary to the nature of thoſe waters) over-flow all weak; or ſecure neighbor Princes, without any other title, or quarrell, than <hi>Stet pro ratione voluntas.</hi> And foreſeeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:169718:65"/>
in this ſuddain violence, that they could expect no Eſtate to be ſelfly engaged in their ſuccor; but muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to ſtand, or fall alone by that courſe. Where, on the other ſide, if the Eaſtern half-Moon ſhould but ſeem to move towards them, they were aſſured to have all the Eſtates of <hi>Europe,</hi> engaged by their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, to joine with them. Upon this view there is no doubt, but that wiſe City would have reſolved it to be a choice of leſs evill, to joine with theſe great Princes, in diverting his Spaniſh gallies, and galleons by Sea, and his inveterate Armies by land from diſturbing, or ſubjecting the ſafety, and traffique of all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to his ſeven patch'd coated Kingdomes, rather than for want of heart or opportunity, to ſtand neuter (as they doe) and become treaſurers both of money, and munition for him, that already intends thus to conquer them, and enjoy it.</p>
            <p>Again, ſhall we (ſaid Sir <hi>Philip)</hi> in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:169718:65"/>
theſe collections of particulars, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the State of <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf? which excellent temper of ſpirits, earth, and aire, having long been ſmothered, and mowed down by the differing Tyrannies of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhall we not be confident they would, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the approaching of theſe armies, both ſtir up thoſe benumbed Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignties, which onely bear the name of free Princes, to affect their own Manumiſſions, &amp; help to chaſe away theſe ſucceeding and oppreſſing Garriſons, whoſe fore-fathers forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares had ſold life, libertie, and lawes for eight pence the day; and ſo reſolutely oppoſe thoſe Spaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, or Spaniſh-ſworn Tyrannies, which have for divers ages Lorded over that moſt equally tempered Nation.</p>
            <p>Or whether the winter in thoſe Seas, giving opportunity without ſuſpition, may not encourage the Claim of our old rights in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> more legall than moſt
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:169718:66"/>
of his Spaniſh intruſions; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in be welcome to the Grand Signior, the freedom of <hi>Algiers,</hi> even to <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf. And beſides, if we proſpered, yield abundance of wealth by ſpoil, and trade: with ſuch a ſeat for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, or poſſeſſion, as by many vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and inviſible helps, might be kept, or put away with infinite ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, he made a Quaere, whether the Pope himſelf would not (like a ſecular Prophet) to keep his becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chaplain a little the farther off; either wink, or at leaſt delay his thundering curſes, or ſupplies of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-pence</hi> againſt theſe qualifying Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, onely to moderate the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greatneſſe of his Spaniſh Monarchie? whoſe infancie having been nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the Miters holy water, and ſophiſtries of his practiſing <hi>Conclaves,</hi> dares now imperiouſly publiſh to the world a reſolution, of taking all other diſtinctions from amongſt men, ſaving that Canonicall regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:169718:66"/>
of wit and might, whereby he might ſo preſerve his ſpirituall am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition entire, without any charge or change of Religion, or Soveraignties from one hand to another, but like a holy father mediate the reſtoring of <hi>Italy</hi> to her ancient free, and diſtinct Principalities. Whereby now by this moderate courſe, admit the Pope for his part, ſhould impair his temporall profits, and ſubaltern jurisdiction a while; yet ſhall he be ſure, (as I ſaid) to multiply his ſpirituall honors, and inlarge that Kingdom, by theſe works of <hi>Supererogation.</hi> And by joyning with his fellow Princes in a contribution, by way of accompt, or countenance to pay theſe great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, be ſure to ſit rent-free under his, and their own vines, as abſolute ſpirituall, and temporall Princes ought to doe?</p>
            <p>From which (ſaith he) this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion will probably follow; that the undertaking of this <hi>Antonie</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, I mean <hi>France,</hi> would prove a
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:169718:67"/>
begetting of brave occaſions jointly to diſturb this Spaniſh <hi>Ottoman,</hi> in all his waies of crafty, or forcible conqueſts. Eſpecially ſince <hi>Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> the ſtandard of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, would infallibly incline to unite with the better part, and by a ſuddain changing of <hi>Mars</hi> his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Enſignes, into a well ballanced treaty of univerſall Peace, reſtore and keep the world within her old <hi>equilibrium</hi> or bounds.</p>
            <p>And the rather, becauſe her long cuſtom in governing, would quickly have made her diſcern, that it had been impoſſible, by force, or any human wiſdom to have qualified theſe over-grown Combinations of <hi>Spain;</hi> but onely by a countermining of party with party, and a diſtracting of exorbitant deſires, by caſting a gray-headed cloud of fear over them; thereby manifeſting the well diſguiſed yokes of bondage, under which our Modern Conquerors would craftily entice the Nown-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective-natured
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:169718:67"/>
Princes, and ſubjects of this time to ſubmit their necks. A map (as it pleaſed her to ſay) of his ſecrets, in which ſhe confeſſed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the more ripe, becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the like falſe Enſignes, though perchance better maſked, ſhe had ſeen <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond after the ſame meaſure, or with little difference, to <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France,</hi> a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall fellow-member in that earthly founded, though heavenly ſeeming Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when he redelivered <hi>Amiers, Abbeville,</hi> &amp;c. together with that fouldier-like paſſage made by the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> through <hi>France,</hi> to the relief of <hi>Paris;</hi> yet whether this provident <hi>Philip</hi> did frame theſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious charities of a conqueror, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus-</hi>like, aſpiring to live after death greater than his ſucceſſor; or providently foreſeeing that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers humors in ſucceeding Princes, would prove unable to maintain ſuch green uſurpations, in the heart of a Kingdom competitor with his
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:169718:68"/>
ſeven-headed <hi>Hydra</hi> kept together onely by a conſtant and unnaturall wheel of fortune, till ſome new child of hers, like <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, ſhould take his turn in reſtoring all unjuſt combinations or encroch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; or laſtly, whether, like a true cutter of Cumine ſeedes, he did not craftily lay theſe hypocritall ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon the Altar of death, as peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings from pride to the temple of fear, as ſmoaks dying of a diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed conſcience choked up with inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud: of all which perplexed pedigrees, I know not what to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine otherwiſe; than that theſe Tyrannicall enchrochments doe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the images of Hell, and her thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-workers, in their own breaſts, as fortune doth misfortunes in that wind-blown, vaſt, and various womb of hers.</p>
            <p>Or if this ſhould ſeem of too high a nature, or too many chargeable parts: then whether to begin again where we left and by the example

            <p>UPon due conſideration of which particulars, he fore-ſeeing that each of the former required greater reſolution, union, and expenſe, than the naturality, diffidence, and quiet complexion of the Princes then reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning could well bear; and beſides the freedome of choyce to bee taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or at the leaſt obſtructed by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall miſts of ignorance, or factious counſells reigning among the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Kings: he reſolved from the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:169718:69"/>
grounds of his former intended voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> that the only credible means left, was, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail him by invaſion, or incurſion (as occaſion fell out) in ſome part of that rich, and deſert Weſt-Indian Mine.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe it is an obſervation among the wiſeſt, that as no man is a Prophet in his own Countrey; ſo all men may get honour much cheaper far off than at home, and at ſea more eaſily than at land.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in reſpect he diſcovered the Spaniſh conqueſts in thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote parts, ſo much noiſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world, to be indeed like their Jeſuits Miracles; which comming far, were multiplied by Fame and Art, to keep other Nation sin wonder, and blind worſhip.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, out of confident beliefe, that their inhumane cruelties had ſo diſpeopled, &amp; diſpleaſed thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys; that as he was ſure to find no great power to withſtand him; ſo might he well hope the Reliques of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:169718:69"/>
thoſe oppreſſed <hi>Cimerons</hi> would joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully take Arms with any forrainer to redeem their liberty, and revenge their parents bloud.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, by reaſon the ſcale of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between <hi>Spain</hi> &amp; <hi>America</hi> was ſo great; as it infallibly aſſured Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> he ſhould find leaſure enough to land, fortifie, and become Maſter of the field, before any ſuccour could come thither to interrupt him.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, the pride, delicacy, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> which made him live without Diſcipline; and truſt more to the greatneſs of his name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, than any ſtrength, order, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, or munition at home.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, Sir <hi>Philip</hi> prophecying what the pedigrees of Princes did warrant, I mean the happy conjunction of of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to theſe populous Realms <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Ireland;</hi> foreſaw, that if this multitude of people were not ſtudiouſly husbanded, and diſpoſed, they would rather diminiſh, than add any ſtrength to this Monarchy.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:169718:70"/>
Which danger (he conjectured) could only by this deſigne of forrain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment, or the peaceable harveſt of manufactures at home, be ſafely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh, and a chief motive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was, that no other action could be leſs ſubject to emulation of Court, leſs ſtraining to the preſent humors of State, more concurring with expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, and voice of time; nor where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was greater poſſibility of improving merit, wealth, &amp; friends.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, he did, as all undertakers muſt doe, believe that there is ever good intelligence between chance &amp; hazard, and ſo left ſome things not ſummed up before hand by exact mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes. But rather thought good to venture upon the caſt of a <hi>Rubicon</hi> Dy; either to ſtop his ſprings of gold, and ſo drie up that torrent which carried his ſubduing Armies every where; or elſe by the wakefull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of threatned neighbors, force him to waft home that conquering
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:169718:70"/>
Metall with infinite charge, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding unwarranted from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching thoſe enemies, whom he prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally ſtudied to ſuppreſs by it.</p>
            <p>To confirm which opinion, he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw how this racked vanity of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> government (intending to work a change in the free courſe of nature) had interdicted all manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, traffick, or vent by ſea, or land, between the natives of <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> &amp; all nations elſe, <hi>Spain</hi> excepted. And withall, to make the barrenneſs of <hi>Spain</hi> more fertile, how he had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved that idle <hi>Caſtilian,</hi> by imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in activeneſs, wealth, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over thoſe vanquiſhed crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; ſuffering the poor native <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans</hi> to be ſuppreſt with heavy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, diſcouraging idleneſs, bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of laws, ſheering of the humble ſheep to cloath the proud devouring Wolves; finally, under theſe, &amp; ſuch like quinteſſences of tyranny ſtriving (as I ſaid) even beſides nature, to make barren <hi>Spain</hi> the Monarchy, &amp;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:169718:71"/>
that every way more fertile <hi>America</hi> to be the Province. All which affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of power to be wiſer, &amp; ſtronger than the truth, this Gentleman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded would in fulnes of time make manifeſt; that the heavy can no more be forced to aſcend, and reſt fixed there, than the light to goe down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as to their proper center.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding, the ſtate of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants is ſo ſublime, and their errors founded upon ſuch precipitate ſteps, as this growing <hi>Spaniard</hi> both did, doth, and ever will travell (with his forefathers in Paradiſe) to be equall, or above his Maker; and ſo to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon divine laws within the narrownes of will, and humane wiſdome, with the fettred ſelfsneſſes of cowardly or other confident Tyranny. In which prepoſterous courſes, to prevent all poſſibility of commotion, let the Reader be pleaſed to obſerve, how that continually he forceth his own ſubjects free-denized in <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> to fetch weapons of defence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:169718:71"/>
invaſion; as well as ornament, wealth, neceſſity, and delicacy, out of <hi>Spain,</hi> meerly to retain want, ſupply, price, weight, faſhion, and meaſure, ſtill (contrary to nature) in that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Crown of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> with an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power reſting in himſelf to rock, or eaſe both peoples, according to the waving ends of an unſteddy, and ſharp pointed Pyramis of power.</p>
            <p>Nay, to riſe yet a ſtep higher in this bloudy pride; Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> our unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> obſerved this limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ambition of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to have choſen that uttermoſt Citadell of bondage, I mean the Inquiſition of <hi>Spain,</hi> for her inſtrument. Not, as in former Masks, to prune, or govern; but in a confidence riſing out of the old age of ſuperſtitious fantaſms, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to root out all ſeeds of humane freedom; and (as Sr <hi>Philip</hi> conceived) with fatal diſſolution to it ſelf. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that theſe types of extremity would ſoon publiſh to the world, what little difference Tyrants ſtrive
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:169718:72"/>
to leave between the creation, uſe, and honor of men, and beaſts, valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them indifferently but as Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to ſum up the divers, nay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary uſes, and Audits of ſublime and wandring ſupremacy, which true glaſs would (in this Gentlemans opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) ſhew the moſt dull &amp; coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eye, that Tyrants be not nurſing Fathers, but ſtep-fathers; and ſo no anointed deputies of God, but rather lively Images of the dark Prince, that ſole author of diſ-creation, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, who ever ruines his ends with over-building.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, where his reaſon ended, there many divine Precepts, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples did aſſure him, that the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God muſt neceſſarily hang over thoſe hypocriticall cruelties, which under colour of converting ſouls to him, ſent millions of better than their own, they cared not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And in ſtead of ſpreading Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion by good life, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch terrible inhumanities, as
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:169718:72"/>
gave thoſe that lived under nature manifeſt occaſion to abhor the devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly characters of ſo tyrannical a deity.</p>
            <p>Now though this juſtice of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty be many times ſlow, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neglected here on earth; yet (I ſay) under the only conduct of this ſtar did Sir <hi>Philip</hi> intend to revive this hazardous enterprize of Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Main of <hi>America;</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, nay undertaken long before, (as I ſhewed you) but ill executed in the abſence of Sir <hi>Philip;</hi> with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to poſſeſs <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> or ſome other haven near unto it, as places, in reſpect of the little diſtance between the two ſeas, eſteemed the fitteſt <hi>Rendez-vouz</hi> for ſupply, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of an Army upon all occaſions. And beſides, by that means to circle in his wealth and freedome, with a joynt fore-running Fleet; to the end, that if the fortune of Conqueſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered not with them, yet he ſhould infallibly pay the charge of both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies, with infinite loſs, and diſ-repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:169718:73"/>
And in this project Sir <hi>Philip</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo far with the united Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, as they yeelded to aſſiſt, and ſecond the ſhips of his Soveraign, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his charge, with a fleet of their own. Which, beſides a preſent addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſtrength, he knew would lead in others by example.</p>
            <p>Again, for ſupply of theſe Armies, he had (out of that naturall tribute, which all free ſpirits acknowledge to ſuperior worth) won 30 Gentlemen of great bloud, and ſtate here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> every man to ſell one hundred pounds land, to ſecond, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance this firſt Fleet with a ſtronger.</p>
            <p>Now when theſe beginnings were by his own credit and induſtrie thus well ſetled: then to give an excellent form to a reall work, hee contrived this new intended Plantation, not like an <hi>Aſſylum</hi> for fugitives, a <hi>Bellum Piraticum</hi> for <hi>Banditi,</hi> or any ſuch baſe <hi>Ramas</hi> of people; but as an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porium</hi> for the confluence of all Nations that love, or profeſs any
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:169718:73"/>
kinde of vertue, or Commerce.</p>
            <p>Wherein to incite thoſe that tarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at home to adventure, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the hope of a ſure, and rich return. To Martiall men he opened wide the door of ſea and land, for fame and conqueſt. To the nobly ambitious the far ſtage of <hi>America,</hi> to win honour in. To the Religious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, beſides a new Apoſtolicall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the laſt heathen to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith, a large field of reducing poor Chriſtians, miſ-led by the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of <hi>Rome,</hi> to their mother <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Church. To the ingenuouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious variety of natural richeſſes, for new myſteries, and manufactures to work upon. To the Merchant, with a ſimple people, a fertile, and unexhauſted earth. To the fortune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, liberty. To the curious, a fruitfull womb of innovation. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the word gold was an attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Adamant, to make men venture that which they have, in hope to grow rich by that which they have not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:169718:74"/>
What the expectation of this voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was, the time paſt can beſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; but what the ſucceſs ſhould have been (till it be revived by ſome ſuch generous undertakers) lies hid in Gods ſecret judgements, who did at once cut off this Gentlemans life, and ſo much of our hope.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe enterpriſes of his, I have preſumed to ſtand the longer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe from the aſhes of this firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded voyage to <hi>America<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>THerefore to come at the laſt to that diverting imployment,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:169718:74"/>
promiſed to him under his Uncle in the Low-Countries: he was, upon his return to the Court, inſtantly made for Garriſon, Governor of <hi>Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing,</hi> and for the Field, General of the Horſe; in both which charges, his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage teſtified to the world, wiſdome, and valour, with addition of honour to his Country by them.</p>
            <p>For inſtance; how like a Souldier did he behave himſelf, firſt in contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, then in executing the ſurpriſe of <hi>Axil?</hi> where he revived that anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and ſecure diſcipline of order, &amp; ſilence in their March; and after their entrance into the town, placed a band of choice ſouldiers to make a ſtand in the Market-place, for ſecuritie to the reſt, that were forced to wander up and down by direction of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders; and when the ſervice was done, rewarded that obedience of diſcipline in every one, liberally, out of his own purſe.</p>
            <p>How providently again did he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the lives and honor of our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:169718:75"/>
Army, at that enterpriſe of <hi>Gravelin?</hi> where though he was guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by directions given him; yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of arguments drawn from the perſon of <hi>La Motte,</hi> Commander of that town, who had a generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of too much worth, either <hi>Simon-</hi>like to deceive, or eaſily to be deceived; or out of the ſtrength and importance of that place, precious to the owner in many reſpects, the leaſt of which would redouble loſs to the growing ambition of a Conqueror; or whether upon caution given by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence; or whatſoever light of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion elſe; he (I ſay) was reſolute not to hazzard ſo many principall Gentlemen, with ſuch gallant Troops and Commanders which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him, in that flattering expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Yet becauſe he kept this ſteady counſel in his own boſome, there was labouring on every ſide to obtain the honour of that ſervice. To all which gallant kind of competition, he made this anſwer, that his own comming
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:169718:75"/>
thither was to the ſame end, wherein they were now become his rivalls; &amp; therfore aſſured them, that he would not yeeld any thing to any man, which by right of his place was both due to himſelf, and conſequently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace for him to execute by others: again, that by the ſame rule, he would never conſent to hazzard them that were his friends, and in divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects his equalls, where he found reaſon to make many doubts, and ſo little reaſon to venture himſelf.</p>
            <p>Yet as a Commander, concluding ſomething fit to be done, equally for obedience and triall, he made the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior ſort of Captains try their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune by dice upon a drums head: the lot fell upon Sir <hi>William Brown</hi> his own Lieuetenant, who with a choice company preſently departed, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this proviſionall caution from Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> that if he found practiſe, &amp; not faith, he ſhould ſtreight throw down his Arms, and yeeld himſelf priſoner; proteſting that if they took
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:169718:76"/>
him, he ſhould be ranſomed; if they broke quarter, his death moſt ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revenged.</p>
            <p>On theſe forlorn companies go with this Leader, &amp; before they came into the town, found all outward ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals exactly performed; when they were entred, every ſtreet ſafe and quiet, according to promiſe, till they were paſt any eaſie recovery of the gate; then inſtantly out of the cellars under ground, they were charged by Horſe and Foot. The Leader, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Generalls commandement, diſcovers the treaſon, throws down his arms, and is taken priſoner. The reſt of the company retire, or rather fly towards their ſhips, but ſtil woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and cut off by purſuit of their enemies; till at length a Serjeant of a band, with fifteen more, all <hi>Sidney</hi>'s men (I mean ſuch as could die to win honour, and do ſervice to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try) made a halt, and being fortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mixt of pikes, halberds, and muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, reſolved to be ſlain with their
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:169718:76"/>
backs to their friends, and their faces to their enemies; they moved, or ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with occaſion; and were in both continually charged with Foot and Horſe, till in the end eight were ſlain, and eight left alive. With theſe the Serjeant wounded at the ſide with a ſquare die out of a field-piece, made this brave retreat within view, and at laſt protection of their own Navy; bringing home even in the wounds, nay ruins of himſelf, and company, reputation of courage, and Martiall diſcipline to his Country.</p>
            <p>Moreover, in thoſe private acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of diſcontentment &amp; quarrell, which naturally accompany great ſpirits in the beſt governed Camps, how diſcreetly did Sir <hi>Philip</hi> ballance that brave <hi>Hollock,</hi> made head of a party againſt his Uncle? When put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf between indignities of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to his Soveraign, through the Earl of <hi>Leiceſters</hi> perſon; and yet not fit for a ſupreme Governors place to ground a duel upon; he brought
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:169718:77"/>
thoſe paſſionate charges, which the Count <hi>Hollock</hi> addreſſed upwards to the Earl down by degrees upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Where that brave Count <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> found Sir <hi>Philip</hi> ſo fortified with wiſdom, courage, and truth; beſides the ſtrong partie of former friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſtanding for him in the Counts noble nature; as though ſenſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and many things elſe equal, and unequal between them, were in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance beyond poſſiblitie of pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; yet this one inequality of right on Sir <hi>Philip</hi>'s ſide, made the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder calm; and by coming to terms of expoſtulation, did not only reconcile thoſe two worthy ſpirits, one to another, more firmly than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but withall through himſelf wrought, if not a kind of unitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> and the Count <hi>Hollock,</hi> at leaſt a finall ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe of all violent jealouſies, or facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous expoſtulations.</p>
            <p>Theſe particulars I only point out, leaving the reſt for them, that may,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:169718:77"/>
perchance, write larger ſtories of that time. To be ſhort; not in comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and art, but reall proofe given of his ſufficience above others, in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little time his reputation, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority amongſt that active people grew ſo faſt, as it had been no hard matter for him, with the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his Uncle, and diſtraction of our affairs in thoſe parts, to have rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf a fortune there. But in the whole courſe of his life, he did ſo conſtantly ballance ambition with the ſafe precepts of divine, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral duty, as no pretence whatſoever could have entiſed that Gentleman, to break through the circle of a good Patriot.</p>

            <p>THus ſhall it ſuffice me to have trod out ſome ſteps of this <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane Scipio,</hi> thereby to give the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a ſcantling, for drawing out the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:169718:78"/>
reſt of his dimenſions by proportion. And to the end the abruptneſs of this Treatiſe may ſuit more equally with his fortune, I will cut off his Actions, as God did his Life, in the midſt; and ſo conclude with his death.</p>
            <p>In which paſſage, though the pride of fleſh, and glory of Mankind be commonly ſo allyed, as the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſeldome ſee any thing elſe in it, but objects of horror, and pittie; yet had the fall of this man ſuch natural degrees, that the wound whereof he died, made rather an addition, than diminution to his ſpirits. So that he ſhewed the world, in a ſhort progreſs to a long home, paſſing fair, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn lines; by the guide of which, all pilgrims of this life may conduct themſelves humbly into the haven of everlaſting reſt.</p>
            <p>When that unfortunate ſtand was to be made before <hi>Zutphen,</hi> to ſtop the iſſuing out of the Spaniſh Army from a ſtreict; with what alacrity ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:169718:78"/>
he went to actions of honor, yet remembring that upon juſt grounds the ancient Sages deſcribe the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt perſons to be ever beſt armed, he had compleatly put on his; but meeting the Marſhall of the Camp lightly armed (whoſe honour in that art would not ſuffer this unenvious <hi>Themistocles</hi> to ſleep) the unſpotted emulation of his heart, to venture without any inequalitie, made him caſt off his Cuiſſes; and ſo, by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret influence of deſtinie, to diſarm that part, where God (it ſeems) had reſolved to ſtrike him. Thus they go on, every man in the head of his own Troop; and the weather being miſty, fell unawares upon the enemie, who had made a ſtrong ſtand to receive them, near to the very walls of <hi>Zut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen;</hi> by reaſon of which accident their Troops fell, not only unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly to be engaged within the levell of the great ſhot, that played from the Rampiers, but more fatally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:169718:79"/>
ſhot of their Muſkets, which were layd in ambuſh within their own trenches.</p>
            <p>Now whether this were a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate cure in our Leaders, for a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate diſeaſe; or whether miſpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, neglect, audacity, or what elſe induced it, it is no part of my office to determine, but onely to make the narration clear, and deliver rumor, as it paſſed then, without any ſtain, or enammel.</p>
            <p>Howſoever, by this ſtand, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate hand out of thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken Trenches, brake the bone of Sir <hi>Philip</hi>'s thigh with a Muſket-ſhot. The horſe he rode upon, was rather furiouſly cholleric, than bravely proud, and ſo forced him to forſake the field, but not his back, as the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt, and fitteſt biere to carry a Martiall Commander to his grave. In which ſad progreſs, paſſing along by the reſt of the Army, where his Uncle the Generall was, and being

thirſtie with exceſs of bleeding, he called for drink, which was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought him; but as he was put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the bottle to his mouth, he ſaw a poor Souldier carryed along, who had eaten his laſt at the ſame Feaſt, gaſtly caſting up his eyes at the bottle. Which Sir <hi>Philip</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, took it from his head, before he drank, and delivered it to the poor man, with theſe words, <hi>Thy neceſsity is yet greater than mine.</hi> And when he had pledged this poor ſouldier, he was preſently carried to <hi>Arnheim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where the principal Chirurgions of the Camp attended for him; ſome mercinarily out of gain, others out of honour to their Art, but the moſt of them with a true zeal (compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of love and reverence) to doe him good, and (as they thought) many Nations in him. When they began to dreſs his wound, he both by way of charge, and advice, told
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:169718:80"/>
them, that while his ſtrength was yet entire, his body free from feaver, and his mind able to endure, they might freely uſe their art, cut, and ſearch to the bottome. For beſides his hope of health, he would make this farther profit of the pains which he muſt ſuffer, that they ſhould bear witneſs, they had indeed a ſenſible natured man under their hands, yet one to whom a ſtronger Spirit had given power above him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, either to do, or ſuffer. But if they ſhould now neglect their Art, and renew torments in the declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature, their ignorance, or over-tenderneſs would prove a kind of tyranny to their friend, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently a blemiſh to their reverend ſcience.</p>
            <p>With love and care well mixt, they began the cure, and continued it ſome ſixteen dayes, not with hope, but rather ſuch confidence of his recovery, as the joy of their
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:169718:80"/>
hearts over-flowed their diſcretion, and made them ſpread the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of it to the <hi>Queen,</hi> and all his noble friends here in <hi>England,</hi> where it was received, not as private, but publique good news.</p>
            <p>Onely there was one Owle among all the birds, which though looking with no leſs zealous eyes than the reſt, yet ſaw, and preſaged more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair: I mean an excellent Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Count <hi>Hollocks,</hi> who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Count himſelf lay at the ſame inſtant hurt in the throat with a Muſket ſhot, yet did he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect his own extremitie to ſave his friend, and to that end had ſent him to Sir <hi>Philip.</hi> This Chirurgion not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding (out of love to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter) returning one day to dreſs his wound, the Count cheerfully aſked him how Sir <hi>Philip</hi> did? And being anſwered with a heavy countenance, that he was not well; at theſe words the worthy Prince (as having more
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:169718:81"/>
ſenſe of his friends wounds, than his own) cries out, Away villain, never ſee my face again, till thou bring bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter news of that mans recovery; for whoſe redemption many ſuch as I were happily loſt.</p>
            <p>This honourable act I relate, to give the world one modern example; firſt, that greatneſs of heart is not dead every where; and then, that war is both a fitter mould to faſhion it, and ſtage to act it on, than peace can be; and laſtly, that the reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of enemies may prove ſafe, and honourable, where the ciment on either ſide is worth. So as this <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> precept concerning reconciled enemies, deſerves worthily to be buried with unworthines the author of it, or at leaſt the practiſe of it cryed down, and baniſhed, to reign among barbarous heathen ſpirits, who while they think life the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of all things, hold it ſafe in no body that their own errors make
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:169718:81"/>
doubtfull to them. And ſuch ſeems every man that moves any paſſion, but pleaſure, in thoſe intricate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>Now after the ſixteenth day was paſt, and the very ſhoulder-bones of this delicate Patient worn through his skin, with conſtant, and obedient poſturing of his body to their Art; he judiciouſly obſerving the pangs his wound ſtang him with by fits, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with many other ſymptoms of decay, few or none of recovery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan rather to ſubmit his body to theſe Artiſts, than any farther to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in them. During which ſuſpenſe, he one morning lifting up the clothes for change &amp; eaſe of his body, ſmelt ſome extraordinary noiſom ſavor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, differing from oyls and ſalvs, as he conceived; &amp; either out of naturall delicacy, or at leaſt care not to offend others, grew a little troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with it; which they that ſate by perceiving, beſought him to let them
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:169718:82"/>
know what ſuddain indiſpoſition he felt? Sir <hi>Philip</hi> ingenuouſly told it, and deſired them as ingenuouſly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, whether they felt any ſuch noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome thing, or no? They all proteſted againſt it upon their credits. Whence Sir <hi>Philip</hi> preſently gave this ſevere doom upon himſelf; that it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mortification, and a welcome meſſenger of death.</p>
            <p>Shortly after, when the Chirurgions came to dreſs him, he acquainted them with theſe piercing intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between him, and his mortality. Which though they oppoſed by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of books, paralleling of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and other artificiall probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; yet moved they no alteration in this man, who judged too truly of his own eſtate, and from more certain grounds, than the vanity of opinion in erring artificers could poſſibly pierce into. So that afterwards, how freely ſoever he left his body ſubject to their practiſe, and continued a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:169718:82"/>
beyond exception; yet did he not change his minde; but as having caſt off all hope, or deſire of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, made, and divided that little ſpan of life which was left him in this manner.</p>

            <p>FIrſt, he called the Miniſters unto him; who were all excellent men, of divers Nations, and before them made ſuch a confeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith, as no book but the heart can truly, and feelingly deliver. Then deſired them to accompany him in Prayer, wherein hee beſought leave to lead the aſſembly, in reſpect, (as he ſaid) that the ſecret ſins of his own heart were beſt known to himſelf, and out of that true ſenſe, he more properly inſtructed to apply the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:169718:83"/>
Sacrifice of our Saviours Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Merits to him. His religious Zeal prevailed with this humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout, &amp; afflicted company; In which wel choſen progreſs of his, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they were all moved, and thoſe ſweet motions witneſſed by ſighes and tears, even interrupting their common devotion; yet could no man judge in himſelf, much leſs in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whether this rake of heavenly agony, whereupon they all ſtood, were forced by ſorrow for him, or admiration of him; the fire of this <hi>Phenix</hi> hardly being able out of any aſhes to produce his equall, as they conceived.</p>
            <p>Here this firſt mover ſtayed the motions in every man, by ſtaying himſelf. Whether to give reſt to that frail wounded fleſh of his, unable to hear the bent of eternity ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, any longer; or whether to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract that ſpirit more inwardly, and by chewing as it were the cudd of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:169718:83"/>
meditation, to imprint thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent images in hs ſoul; who can judge but God? Notwithſtanding, in this change, (it ſhould ſeem) there was little, or no change in the object. For inſtantly after prayer, he entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this quire of divine Philoſophers about him, to deliver the opinion of the ancient Heathen, touching the immortality of the ſoul: Firſt, to ſee what true knowledge ſhe retains of her own eſſence, out of the light of her ſelf; then to parallel with it the moſt pregnant authorities of the old, and new Teſtament, as ſupernatural revelations, ſealed up from our fleſh, for the divine light of faith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal, and work by. Not that he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted inſtruction, or aſſurance; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this fixing of a lovers thoughts upon thoſe externall beauties, was not only a cheering up of his decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirits, but as it were a taking poſſeſſion of that immortall inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which was given unto him by
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:169718:84"/>
his brother-hood in CHRIST.</p>
            <p>The next change uſed, was the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for his Will; which though at firſt ſight it may ſeem a deſcent from heaven to earth again; yet he that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the diſtinction of thoſe offices, which he practiſed in beſtowing his own, ſhall diſcern, that as the ſoul of man is all in all, and all in every part; ſo was the goodnes of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture equally diſperſed, into the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, and leaſt actions of his too ſhort life. Which Will of his, will ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main for a witneſs to the world, that thoſe ſweet, and large, even dying affections in him, could no more be contracted with the narrowneſs of pain, grief, or ſickneſs, than any ſparkle of our immortality can bee privately buried in the ſhadow of death.</p>
            <p>Here again this reſtleſs ſoul of his (changing only the aire, and not the cords of her harmony) cals for Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; eſpecially that ſong which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:169718:84"/>
had intitled, <hi>La cuiſſe rompue.</hi> Partly (as I conceive by the name) to ſhew that the glory of mortal fleſh was ſhaken in him: and by that Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick it ſelf, to faſhion and enfranchiſe his heavenly ſoul into that everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing harmony of Angels, whereof theſe Concords were a kinde of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall <hi>Echo:</hi> And in this ſupreme, or middle Orb of Contemplations, he bleſſedly went on, within a circular motion, to the end of all fleſh.</p>
            <p>The laſt ſcene of this Tragedy was the parting between the two brothers: the weaker ſhewing infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſtrength in ſuppreſſing ſorrow, and the ſtronger infinite weakneſs in expreſſing of it. So far did invalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able worthineſſe, in the dying bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enforce the living to deſcend beneath his owne worth, and by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of childiſh tears, bewail the publique, in his particular loſs. Yea ſo far was his true remiſſion
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:169718:85"/>
of minde transformed into ejulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> (in whom all earthly, paſſion did even as it were flaſh, like lights ready to burn out) recals thoſe ſpirits together with a ſtrong vertue, but weak voice; mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blaming him for relaxing the frail ſtrengths left to ſupport him, in his finall combate of ſeparation at hand. And to ſtop this naturall torrent of affection-in both, took his leave, with theſe admoniſhing words:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Love my Memorie, cheriſh my Friends; their Faith to me may aſſure you they are honeſt. But above all, govern your Will, and Affections, by the Will and Word of your Creator; in me, beholding the end of this World, with all her Vanities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:169718:85"/>
And with this Fare-well, deſired the company to lead him away. Here this noble Gentleman ended, the too ſhort Scene his life; in which path, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not confident that he walked the next way to eternall reſt, will be found to judge uncharitably.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee how it pleaſed God to ſhew forth, and then ſuddenly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw this precious light of our skie; and in ſome ſort adopted Patriot of the States-Generall. Between whom, and him, there was ſuch a ſympathie of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; as they honoured that exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant worth in Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> by which time, and occaſion had been like enough to metamorphoſe this new Ariſtocracy of theirs into their ancient, and much honoured forme of <hi>Dukedome.</hi> And he again applauded that univerſall inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuitie, and proſperous undertakings of theirs; over which perchance he felt ſomething in his own nature, poſſible in time to come an elect Commander. So uſuall is it for all mortall conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:169718:86"/>
to affect that, which inſenſibly often works change in them to better, or worſe.</p>
            <p>Now though I am not of their faith, who affirme wiſe men can governe the Starres; yet do I beleeve no Star-gazers can ſo well prognoſticate the good, or ill of all Governments, as the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of men trained up in publique affaires may doe. Whereby they differ from Prophets only in this; that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets by inſpiration, and theſe by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, judge of things to come.</p>
            <p>Amongſt which kind of Prophets, give me leave to reckon this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; who firſt having, out of the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Almanach</hi> of Hiſtory, regiſtred the growth, health, diſeaſe, and periods of Governments: that is to ſay, when Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies grow ready for change, by over-relaxing, or contracting, when the ſtates of few, or many continue, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake to be the ſame: and in the conſtant courſe of theſe viciſſitudes, having fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen the eaſie ſatietie of mankinde with
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:169718:86"/>
Religion, and Government, their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diſcontentment with the preſent, and aptneſſe to welcome alteration: And againe, in the deſcent of each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular forme to her owne centre, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obſerved how theſe United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces had already changed from their ancient Dukedomes to Popularitie: and yet in that Popularitie, been forced to ſeek protection among the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies then raigning; and to make per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this judgment of his, had ſumm'd up the league offenſive, and defenſive between us, and them; even then he grew doubtfull, leſt this advantage would in time leave latitude for envy, and competencie, to work ſome kind of rent in our Union.</p>
            <p>But when in the progreſſe of this proſpect, he fell into a more particular conſideration of their traffique, and ours: they without any native commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities (Art and diligence excepted) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king themſelves Maſters of wealth in all Nations: We againe, by exporting
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:169718:87"/>
our ſubſtantiall riches, to import a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous maſſe of trifles, to the vaine exhauſting of our home-borne ſtaple commodities; he certainly concluded, that this true Philoſophers ſtone of traffique, which not only turned baſe mettals into gold, but made profit by Wars in their owne boſomes, would infallibly ſtir up emulation in ſuch lookers on, as were far from ſtriving o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to imitate them.</p>
            <p>And out of theſe or the like grounds hath many times told me, that this active people (which held themſelves conſtantly to their Religion, and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) would at length grow from an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective to a ſubſtantive, and proſperous ſubſiſtence. Whereas we on the other ſide, dividing our ſelves, and waving in both, ſhould firſt become jealous, then ſtrange to our friends, and in the end (by reconciliation with our common enemie) moderate that zeale, wherein exceſſe only is the meane; and ſo be forced to caſt our fortunes into their
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:169718:87"/>
armes for ſupport, who are moſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in our diſhonour, and ruine. Theſe with many other dangers (which he proviſionally feared) howſoever the wiſdome of our Government may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance have put off by prevention: yet were more then conjecturall in the aſpect of ſuperior, inferior, forraigne, and domeſtique Princes then raigning.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe we could not by this Kalender comprehend the change of Aſpects, and Policies in ſeverall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; yet we may at leaſt therein diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, both the judgment of this <hi>Prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi> concerning our ſelves, and the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affection he carried to that oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Nation. Which reſpect of his they againe ſo well underſtood, as after his death the States of <hi>Zealand</hi> became ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to her Majeſty, &amp; his noble friends, that they might have the honour of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying his body at the publique expence of their Government. A memorable wiſdome of thankfulneſſe, by well handling the dead, to encourage, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:169718:88"/>
multiply faith in the living.</p>
            <p>Which requeſt had it been granted, the Reader may pleaſe to conſider, what Trophies it is likely they would have erected over him, for poſterity to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, and what inſcriptions would have been deviſed for eternizing his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. Indeed fitter for a great, and brave Nation to enlarge, then the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, or good will of a private, and inferior friend. For my own part I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, in all I have here ſet downe of his worth, and goodneſſe; I find my ſelf ſtill ſhort of that honour he deſerved, and I deſired to doe him.</p>
            <p>I muſt therefore content my ſelfe with this poor demonſtration of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; and ſo proceed to ſay ſomewhat of the toyes, or Pamphlets, which I inſcribe to his memory, as monuments of true affection between us; whereof (you ſee) death hath no power.</p>

            <p>WHen my youth, with favour of Court in ſome moderate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to my birth, and breeding in the activeneſſe of that time, gave mee opportunity of moſt buſineſſe: then did my yet undiſcouraged Genius moſt affect to finde, or make work for it ſelf.

            <p>For inſtance, how mild ſoever thoſe mixtures of favours, and corrections
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:169718:89"/>
were in that Princely Lady: yet to ſhew that they fell heavy in croſſing a young mans ends; I will onely chooſe, and alleage foure out of many, ſome with leave, ſome without.</p>
            <p>Firſt, when thoſe two mighty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Don Iohns,</hi> and the Duke <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimires,</hi> were to meet in the Low Countries; my Horſes, with all other preparations being ſhipped at <hi>Dover,</hi> with leave under her Bill aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: Even then was I ſtayed by a Princely Mandate, the Meſſenger Sir <hi>Edward Dier.</hi> Wherein whatſoever I felt, yet I appeale to the judicious Reader, whether there be any latitude left (more then humble obedience) in theſe nice caſes between duty, and ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in a Soveraignes ſervice?</p>
            <p>After this, when Mr Secretary <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ham</hi> was ſent Embaſſador, to treate with thoſe two Princes in a buſineſſe ſo much concerning Chriſtian blood, and Chriſtian Empires; then did the ſame irregular motion (which ſeldome
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:169718:89"/>
reſts, but ſteales where it cannot trade) perſwade me, that whoſoever would venture to go without leave, was ſure never to bee ſtayed. Upon which falſe axiome (truſting the reſt to chance) I went over with Mr Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, unknown: But at my returne was forbidden her preſence for many moneths.</p>
            <p>Againe, when my Lord of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> was ſent Generall of Her Majeſties Forces into the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and had given me the command of an hundred Horſe; then I giving my humors over to good order, yet found, that neither the earneſt interceſſion of this Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee, ſecond with mine own humble ſute, and many other Honourable Friends of mine, could prevaile againſt the conſtant courſe of this excellent Lady with her Servants. So as I was forced to tarry behind; and for this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of mine to change my courſe, and ſeem to preferre nothing before my ſervice about her: This
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:169718:90"/>
Princeſſe of Government, as well as Kingdomes, made me live in her Court a ſpectacle of diſ-favour, too long as I conceived.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the univerſall fame of a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to bee fought, between the prime Forces of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, then King of <hi>Navarre;</hi> lifting me yet once more above this humble earth of duty, made me reſolve to ſee the difference between Kings preſent, and abſent in their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Expeditions. So that without acquainting any creature, the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> excepted, I ſhipped my ſelfe over: and at my returne, was kept from her preſence full ſix moneths, and then received after a ſtrange manner. For this abſolute Prince, to ſever ill example from grace, averrs my going over to bee a ſecret imployment of Hers: and all theſe other petty exiles, a making good of that cloud, or figure, which ſhe was pleaſed to caſt over my abſence. Protecting me to the world
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:169718:90"/>
with the honour of her imployment, rather then ſhe would, for examples ſake, be forced either to puniſh mee farther, or too eaſily forgive a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or neglect, in a Servant ſo near about her, as ſhe was pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</p>
            <p>By which many warnings, I finding the ſpecious fires of youth to prove far more ſcorching, then glorious, called my ſecond thoughts to counſell, and in that Map cleerly diſcerning Action, and Honor, to fly with more wings then one: and that it was ſufficient for the plant to grow where his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes hand had planted it; I found reaſon to contract my thoughts from thoſe larger, but wandring <hi>Horizons,</hi> of the world abroad, and bound my proſpect within the ſafe limits of duty, in ſuch home ſervices, as were accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to my Soveraigne.</p>
            <p>In which retired view, Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> that exact image of quiet, and action: happily united in him, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:169718:91"/>
ſeldome well divided in any; being ever in mine eyes, made me thinke it no ſmall degree of honour to imitate, or tread in the ſteps of ſuch a Leader. So that to ſaile by his Compaſſe, was ſhortly (as I ſaid) one of the principall reaſons I can alleage, which perſwaded me to ſteale minutes of time from my daily ſervices, and employ them in this kind of writing.</p>
            <p>Since my declining age, it is true, that I had (for ſome yeeres) more lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to diſcover their imperfections, then care, or induſtry to amend them: finding in my ſelfe, what all men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of in the world, that it is more eaſie to finde fault, excuſe, or tolerate, then to examine, and reforme.</p>
            <p>The workes (as you ſee) are Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, with ſome Treatiſes annexed. The Treatiſes (to ſpeake truly of them) were firſt intended to be for every Act a Chorus: and though not borne out of the preſent matter acted, yet being the largeſt ſubjects I could then think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:169718:91"/>
and no ſuch ſtrangers to the ſcope of the Tragedies, but that a favourable Reader might eaſily find ſome conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinitie between them; I preferring this generall ſcope of profit, before the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reputation of being an exact Artiſan in that Poeticall Myſtery, conceived that a perſpective into vice, and the unproſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perities of it, would prove more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to every good Readers ends, then any bare murmur of diſcontented ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits againſt their preſent Government, or horrible periods of exorbitant paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among equals.</p>
            <p>Which with humble ſayles after I had once ventured upon this ſpreading <hi>Ocean</hi> of Images, my apprehenſive youth, for lack of a well touched com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, did eaſily wander beyond propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And in my old age againe, looking back on them with a fathers eye: when I conſidered firſt, how poorly the inward natures of thoſe glorious names were expreſſed: then how much eaſier it was to excuſe deformities, then to cure
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:169718:92"/>
them; though I found reaſon to change their places, yet I could not find in my heart to beſtow coſt, or care, in altering their light, and limited apparell in verſe.</p>
            <p>From hence to come particularly to that Treatiſe intitled: <hi>The Declination of Monarchy.</hi> Let me beg leave of the favourable Reader, to beſtow a few lines more in the ſtory of this Changling, then I have done in the reſt; and yet to uſe no more ſerious authority then the rule of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> which was, to hang the Poſie where there is moſt need.</p>
            <p>The firſt birth of that <hi>Phantaſme</hi> was divided into three parts, with intention of the Author, to be diſpoſed amongſt their fellows, into three diverſe Acts of the Tragedies. But (as I ſaid before) when upon a ſecond review, they, and the reſt were all ordain'd to change their places; then did I (like an old, and fond Parent, unlike to get any more children) take pains rather to cover the dandled deformities of theſe creatures
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:169718:92"/>
with a coat of many ſeames, then care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly to drive them away, as birds doe their young ones.</p>
            <p>Yet againe, when I had in mine own caſe well weigh'd the tenderneſſe of that great ſubject; and conſequently, the nice path I was to walke in between two extremities; but eſpecially the danger, by treading aſide, to caſt ſcandall upon the ſacred foundations of Monarchy; together with the fate of many Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicall <hi>Phormio's</hi> before me, who had loſt themſelves in teaching Kings, and Princes, how to governe their People: then did this new proſpect dazzle mine eyes, and ſuſpend my travell for a time.</p>
            <p>But the familiar ſelf-love, which is more or leſſe born in every man, to live, and dye with him, preſently moved me to take this Bear-whelp up againe and licke it. Wherein I, rowſing my ſelfe under the banner of this flattery, went about (as a fond mother) to put on rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er garments, in hope to adorne them. But while theſe clothes were in making,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:169718:93"/>
I perceived that coſt would but draw more curious eyes to obſerve deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. So that from theſe checks a new counſell roſe up in me, to take away all opinion of ſeriouſneſſe from theſe perplexed pedegrees; and to this end careleſly caſt them into that hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall figure <hi>Ironia,</hi> wherein men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly (to keep above their workes) ſeeme to make toies of the utmoſt they can doe.</p>
            <p>And yet againe, in that confuſing miſt, when I beheld this grave ſubject (which ſhould draw reverence and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention) to bee over-ſpangled with lightneſſe, I forced in examples of the Roman gravity, and greatneſſe, the harſh ſeverity of the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; the riches of the <hi>Athenian</hi> learning, wit, and induſtry; and like a man that plaies divers parts upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall hints, left all the indigeſted cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, equally applied to Kings, or Tyrants: whereas in every cleere judgement, the right line had beene
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:169718:93"/>
ſufficient enough to diſcover the croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; if the image of it could have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved credible to men.</p>
            <p>Now for the ſeverall branches, or diſcourſes following; they are all Members of one, and the ſame imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect body, ſo as I let them take their fortunes (like Eſſayes) onely to tempt, and ſtir up ſome more free Genius, to faſhion the whole frame into finer mould for the worlds uſe. The firſt limme of thoſe Treaties (I mean that Fabrick of a ſuperſtitious Church) having by her maſterfull ambition over Emperours, Kings, Princes, free States, and Councels, with her <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave</hi> deceits, ſtrengths, and unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, ſpred ſo far beyond my <hi>Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,</hi> as I at once gave over her, and all her derivations to <hi>Gamaliels</hi> infallible cenſure; Leaving Lawes, Nobility, War, Peace, and the reſt, (as glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Trophies of our old Pope, the ſin) to change, reforme, or become defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, according as vanity, that limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:169718:94"/>
mother of theſe Idolatries, ſhould either winne of the truth, or the truth of them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, concerning the Tragedies themſelves; they were in their firſt creation three; Whereof <hi>Antonie</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> according to their irregular paſſions, in forſaking Empire to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſenſuality, were ſacrificed to the fire. The executioner, the author himſelfe. Not that he conceived it to be a contemptible younger brother to the reſt: but leſt while he ſeemed to looke over much upward, hee might ſtumble into the Aſtronomers pit. Many members in that creature (by the opinion of thoſe few eyes, which ſaw it) having ſome childiſh wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in them, apt enough to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued, or ſtrained to a perſonating of vices in the preſent Governors, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>From which cautious proſpect, I bringing into my minde the ancient Poets, metamorphoſing mans reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:169718:94"/>
nature into the ſenſitive of beaſts, or vegetative of plants; and knowing theſe all (in their true morall) to bee but images of the unequall ballance between humors, and times; nature, and place. And again in the practice of the world, ſeeing the like inſtance not poetically, but really faſhioned in the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> then falling; and ever till then worthily beloved, both of <hi>Queen,</hi> and people: This ſudden deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of ſuch greatneſſe, together with the quality of the Actors in every Scene, ſtir'd up the Authors ſecond thoughts, to bee carefull (in his owne caſe) of leaving faire weather behind him. Hee having, in the Earles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate fortune, curiouſly obſerved: Firſt, how long this Noblemans birth, worth, and favour had been flattered, tempted, and ſtung by a ſwarm of Sect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animals, whoſe property was to wound, and fly away: and ſo, by a continuall affliction, probably enforce great hearts to turne, and toſſe for eaſe; and in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:169718:95"/>
thoſe paſſive poſtures, perchance to tumble ſometimes upon their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes Circles.</p>
            <p>Into which pitfall of theirs, when they had once diſcerned this Earle to be fallen; ſtraight, under the reverend ſtile of <hi>Laeſa Majeſtas,</hi> all inferiour Miniſters of Juſtice (they knew) would be juſtly ſet looſe to work upon him. And accordingly, under the ſame cloud, his enemies took audacity to caſt Libels abroad in his name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the State, made by themſelves; ſet papers upon poſts, to bring his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent friends in queſtion. His power, by the Jeſuiticall craft of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, they made infinite; and his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition more then equall to it. His Letters to private men were read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, by the the piercing eyes of an Atturnies Office, which warranteth the conſtruction of every time in the worſt ſenſe againſt the writer.</p>
            <p>My ſelfe, his Kinſman, and while I remained about the <hi>Queen,</hi> a kinde of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:169718:95"/>
               <hi>Remora,</hi> ſtaying the violent courſe of that fatall Ship, and theſe winde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watching Paſſengers (at leaſt, as his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies imagined) abruptly ſent away to guard a figurative Fleet, in danger of nothing, but theſe <hi>Proſopopeia's</hi> of invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible rancor; and kept (as in a free Priſon) at <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> till his head was off.</p>
            <p>Before which ſudden journey, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting mine eyes upon the catching Court ayres, which I was to part from; I diſcerned my Gracious Soveraigne to bee every way ſo invironed with theſe, not <hi>Iupiters,</hi> but <hi>Pluto's</hi> thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workers; as it was impoſſible for Her to ſee any light, that might lead to grace, or mercy: but many encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Meteors of ſeverity, as againſt an unthankfull favourite, and traiterous Subject; hee ſtanding, by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> condemned for ſuch.</p>
            <p>So that let his heart bee (as in my conſcience it was) free from this unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall crime, yet theſe <hi>unreturning</hi>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:169718:96"/>
ſteps ſeemed well worth the obſerving. Eſpecially in the caſe of ſuch a Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, as never put his Soveraigne to ſtand between her People, and his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; but here, and abroad placed his body in the forefront, againſt all that either threatned, or aſſaulted Her.</p>
            <p>And being no Admirall, nor yet a Creator of Admiralls, whereby feare, or hope might have kept thoſe tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary <hi>Neptunes</hi> in a kinde of ſubjection to him; yet hee freely ventured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in all Sea-actions of his time. As if he would war the greatneſſe of envy, place, and power, with the greatneſſe of worth, and incomparable induſtry. Nevertheleſſe hee wanted not judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to diſcerne, that whether they went with him, or tarried behind, they muſt probably prove unequall yoke fellowes in the one; or in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſing curious, and carping judges over all his publike Actions.</p>
            <p>Againe, this gallant young Earle, created (as it ſeemes) for action, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:169718:96"/>
he was Martiall, firſt as a private Gentleman, and after as a Lieutenant by Commiſſion, went in the head of all our Land Troops, that marched in his time; and beſides experience, ſtill wan ground, even through competen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, envy, and confuſed mixtures of equality or inequality, amongſt the factious Engliſh, all inferiour in his owne active worth, and merit.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, he was ſo far from affecting the abſolute power of <hi>Henry</hi> the thirds Favourites, I meane under a King to become equall at leaſt with him, in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating and depoſing Chancellors, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers, and Secretaries of State, to raiſe a ſtrong party for himſelfe; as he left both place, and perſons entire in their ſupreme jurisdictions, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracies under his Soveraigne, as ſhee granted them. And though hee fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw a neceſſary diminution of their peacefull predicaments by his carrying up the ſtandard of <hi>Mars</hi> ſo high, and withall knew they (like wiſe men) muſt
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:169718:97"/>
as certainly diſcern, that the riſing of his, or falling of their ſcales depended upon the proſperity, or unproſperity of his undertakings: yet (I ſay) that active heart of his freely choſe to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard himſelfe upon their cenſures, without any other proviſionall ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier againſt the envious, and ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing crafts of that party, then his owne hope, and reſolution to deſerve well.</p>
            <p>Neither did he (like the French Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites of that time) ſerve his own hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors or neceſſities, by ſelling ſeats of Juſtice, Nobility, or orders of honor, till they became <hi>Colliers pour toute beſte,</hi> to the diſparagement of creating pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and diſcouraging of the Subjects hope, or induſtry, in attaining to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, or profit: But ſuffered <hi>England</hi> to ſtand alone, in her ancient degrees of freedomes, and integrities, and ſo reſerved that abſolute power of Creation ſacred in his Soveraigne, without any mercenary ſtaine, or allay.</p>

            <p>NOw after this humble, and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe deſire of a meane ſubject, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in qualifying a great ſubjects errors, by the circumſtance of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, as naturally (like Bats) both flye, and prey in the darke; Let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pardon me, if I preſume yet againe to multiply digreſſion upon digreſſion, in honour of her, to whom I owe my ſelfe, I meane <hi>Queen Elizabeth:</hi> and in her name clear y to know, that though I lament the fall of this great man in Iſrael, nevertheleſſe the truth enforceth me to confeſſe, that howſoever theſe kinds of high juſtice may ſometimes (like the uttermoſt of the Law) fall heavy upon one brave ſpirit; yet prove they mercy to many by example: and therefore as Regall, and Royall wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, ought to be honoured equally
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:169718:98"/>
in all the differing Soveraignties through the world, of one, few or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
            <p>And if this <hi>aſſumpſit</hi> muſt be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted univerſally; then how much more in the caſe of ſuch a Princeſſe, as (even while ſhe was ſubject) left patternes that might inſtruct all ſubjects, rather to undergoe the indignation of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes with the birthright of duty, then with the mutiny of over-ſenſible, and rebellious affections; which ever (like diſeaſed pulſes) beat faſter, or ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then they ſhould, to ſhew all to be infected about them? Whereas this Lady, in the like ſtraines, by an humble, and conſtant temper, had already with true obedience triumphed over the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious examinations of aſcending flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, or deſcending Tyranny, even in the tenderneſſe of Princes ſucceſſions.</p>
            <p>And to make this manifeſt to bee choice, and not chance: even when her ſtepmother misfortune grew ripe for delivery, then was ſhe neither born cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:169718:98"/>
as children be: nor yet by the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den change from a priſon, to a Throne, came ſhe upon that Stage confuſedly barking after all that had offended: but like one borne to behold true light, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly fixeth her thoughts upon larger notions then revenge, or favour. And in the infancy of her Raigne, cals for <hi>Benefield</hi> her hard-hearted Gaoler; bids him enjoy not a deſerved, but free given peace under his narrow vine: with this aſſurance, that whenſoever ſhe deſired to have priſoners over ſeverely intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhe would not forget to commit the cuſtody of them to his charge.</p>
            <p>Againe, for the next object, looking backward upon her ſiſters Raigne, ſhe obſerves Religion to have been changed; Perſecution, like an ill weed, ſuddenly grown up to the higheſt; The mercy of the infinite perſcribed, by abridgment of time, and adding torments to the death of his creatures: ſalvation publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in many more <hi>Creeds</hi> then ſhe was taught to beleeve: A double Supremacy

            </p>
            <p>This view brought forth in her a vow, like that of the holy Kings in the Old Teſtament; <hi>viz.</hi> that ſhe would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hope, nor ſeeke for reſt in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall traffique of this world, till ſhe had repaired the precipitate ruines of our <hi>Saviours Militant Church,</hi> through all her Dominions; and as ſhe hoped, in the reſt of the World, by her example. Upon which Princelike reſolution, this She-<hi>David</hi> of ours ventured to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the great <hi>Goliath</hi> among the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins</hi> abroad, I mean <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Pope;</hi> deſpiſeth their multitudes, not of men, but of Hoſts; ſcornfully rejecteth that Holy Fathers wind-blowne ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and takes the (almoſt ſolitary) truth for her Leading-Star.</p>
            <p>Yet tears ſhe not the Lyons jawes in

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:169718:100"/>
to the mixt Tyranny of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Caſtile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which endleſſe path of ſervitude, the Noune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> adjective nature of this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Princeſſe, proceeded yet a degree further; ſtriving to confirme that double bondage of people, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, by Act of Parliament. Where on the other ſide, the Spaniſh King, beholding theſe remiſſe homages of frailty, with the unthankfull, and inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable eyes of ambition, apprehends theſe petty ſacrifices, as fit ſtrawes, ſticks, or feathers, to be pull'd out of faint wings, for the building up, and adorning of a Conquerours neſt. And under this Tyrannicall <hi>Criſis,</hi> takes freedome to exhauſt her treaſure to his owne ends, breakes our league with <hi>France,</hi> and in that breach ſhakes the ſacred foundation of the reſt, winnes St <hi>Quintins,</hi> while we loſt <hi>Callice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Contrary to all which thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound Councels of her ſiſter <hi>Maries,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (as I ſaid) not yet out
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:169718:100"/>
of danger of her Romiſh ſubjects at home; threatned with their mighty faction, and party abroad; peſter'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides with want of money, and many binding Lawes of her ſiſters making: yet like a Palme, under all theſe bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, ſhe raiſeth her ſelfe Prince-like: and upon notice of her Agents diſgrace abroad, his ſervants being put into the Inquiſition by the Spaniard; her Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants ſurprized in <hi>America,</hi> contrary to the league between <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth; which gave free traffique: <hi>In omnibus, &amp; ſingulis Regnis, Dominiis, Inſulis,</hi> notwithſtanding that Aſtronomicall, or rather biaced divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the world by the Popes lines, which (contrary to the nature of all lines) only keep latitude for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of <hi>Spain:</hi> She (I ſay) upon theſe inſolencies, receives the <hi>Hollander,</hi> and protects him from perſecution of the Duke of <hi>Alva:</hi> ſettles theſe poore Refugees in <hi>Norwich, Colcheſter, Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, Maidſtone,</hi> and <hi>South-Hampton.</hi>

Yet againe, when this faith, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Duke appealed to her ſelfe: ſhe binding her heart for better, or worſe, to the words of her Contract; ſummons theſe afflicted ſtrangers to depart. Their number was great, their time ſhort, and yet their weather-beaten ſoules ſo ſenſible of long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued oppreſſions in their liberties, and conſciences, as (by the opportunity of this Oſtraciſme) they in their paſſage ſurprized <hi>Brill, Fluſhing,</hi> and diverſe other Towns, expulſing the Spaniards; and by this brave example, taught, and proclaimed a way of freedome to all well affected Princes, and Provinces, that were oppreſt.</p>
            <p>Wherein it may pleaſe the Reader to obſerve, that <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France,</hi> being one in the ſame League, and belike upon change of heart, which ever brings forth new queſtions, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, whether <hi>mutuall defence againſt all,</hi> extended to the cauſe of Religion? was preſently anſwered by her; that ſhe
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:169718:101"/>
both treated, and concluded in the ſame ſenſe; and if it were required at her hands, would performe every branch of it to her uttermoſt. The <hi>French King</hi> hereupon makes war with the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants: <hi>Monſieur</hi> his brother ſecretly protects them by <hi>Caſimire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe about that time, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King, ſhe guards his Navy into <hi>Flanders;</hi> where it being loſt, and ſhe requeſted by the ſame King to lend him her owne Ships, for recovery of the Maritime Townes fallen from him: this bleſſed <hi>Lady</hi> both denyes this crafty requeſt of a Conqueror; and withall providently refuſeth any of his ſhips to be harboured in her Ports. Yet in honour of her ancient League with the Houſe of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> ſhe publiſheth the like inhibition to her beloved, and ſafe Neighbours the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> And inſtantly, with a ſtrong judgment in ballancing of forraigne Princes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to make peace with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and on the other
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:169718:102"/>
ſide diſſwades thoſe diſtreſſed <hi>Hollanders</hi> from joyning with <hi>France.</hi> As I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, thinking that Kingdome (manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed from us by time) might through the conjunction of the <hi>Holland</hi> ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and Mariners, with their diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd Land-Armies of horſe and foot, prove more dangerous enemies, either by way of invaſion, or incurſion (as I ſaid once before) then that Kings glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Standard, borne among his barbed horſe, and light foot had hitherto done, either in our entiſed undertakings, or abandoned retraits.</p>
            <p>Beſides it is worthy of reverence in this <hi>Queen,</hi> that ſhe never was afraid, or aſhamed to averre the quarrell of Religion for a ground of her friends, or enemies.</p>
            <p>And though in the charity of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Prince, even in the danger of a growing faction at home, ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to let devout conſcience live qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly in her Realmes: yet when they began to practiſe diſunion in Church,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:169718:102"/>
as their Jeſuited ſpirits naturally affect to doe. Then to ſhew that ſhe was as well ſervant to God, as by him King over Peoples, ſhe tyed the head of the ſacrifice perchance a little cloſer to the hornes of the altar.

            <p>This and ſuch like providence did this miracle of Princes uſe in all her Wars, whereby her Wars maintained her wealth, and that wealth ſupplyed her War. So as ſhe came ever in ſtate, when ſhe demanded aid from her Houſe of Commons. Neither did ſhe fetch, or force preſidents from her Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in thoſe demands: but made her ſelf a preſident to all Poſterities, that the love of people to a loving Princeſſe is not ever curiouſly ballanced, by the ſelf-pittying abilities of mankinde: but their ſpirits, hearts, and ſtates being drawne up above their owne fraile ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the audit is taken after; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance ſumm'd up with a little ſmart to themſelves, wherein they glory.</p>
            <p>Neither did ſhe, by any curious
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:169718:104"/>
ſearch after Evidence to enlarge her Prerogatives Royall, teach her ſubjects in Parliament, by the like ſelf-affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to make as curious inquiſition among their Records, to colour any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching upon the ſacred Circles of Monarchy: but left the riſe or fall of theſe two ballances aſleep, with thoſe aſpiring ſpirits, who (by advantage of ſtate, or time taken) had been authors of many biaced motions. And in ſome confuſed Parliaments amongſt the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons Wars, even forced her Anceſtors, with one breath, to proſcribe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore; to call out of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, by Writ, to the upper Houſe, during the Seſſion: Wherein one mans ſudden advancement proves envious to foure hundred of his equals; and from the ſame, not truly active, but rather paſſive vaine, to impriſon and releaſe unjudicially, ſometime ſtriving to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the multitude, by their Nobility, then again waving the Nobility with the multitude of people; both marks of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:169718:104"/>
diſeaſe, and no healthfull ſtate in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. All which ſhe providently foreſaw, and avoided; leſt, by the like inſenſible degrees of miſleading paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhe might be conſtrained to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, and labour the compaſſing of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly ends, by a Mechanicall kinde of Univerſity Canvaſſe.</p>
            <p>So that this bleſſed, and bleſſing <hi>Lady,</hi> with a calme minde, as well in quiet, as ſtirring times, ſtudied how to keep her ancient under-earth buildings, upon their firſt well laid foundations. And if ſhe found any ſtray'd, rather to reduce them back to their originall circuits, then ſuffer a ſtep to be made over, or beſides thoſe time-authorized aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. And by this reſervedneſſe, ever comming upon the ſtage a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and no Petitionet, ſhe preſerv'd her ſtate above the affronts of Nobility, or people; and according to birthright, ſtill became a ſoveraigne Judge over any dutifull, or encroaching petitions of Nobles, or Commons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:169718:105"/>
For this <hi>Lady,</hi> though not propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, yet like a provident Princeſſe, in the ſeries of things, and times, foreſaw through the long laſting wiſdome of Government, a quinteſſence, howſoever abſtracted out of Morall Philoſophy, and humane Lawes, yet many degrees in uſe of mankinde above them. She, I ſay, foreſaw, that every exceſſe of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion expreſt from the Monarch in Acts, or Councels of Eſtate, would infallibly ſtir up in the people the like cobwebs of a popular ſpinning, and therefore from theſe piercing grounds, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that a ſteady hand in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Soveraignty, would ever prove more proſperous, then any nimble or witty practiſe, crafty ſhifting, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious forcing humors poſſibly could doe.</p>
            <p>Againe in the latitudes which ſome moderne Princes allow to their Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, as ſupporters of Government, and middle wals between power, and the peoples envy; it ſeems this <hi>Queen</hi>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:169718:105"/>
reſervedly kept entrenched within her native ſtrengths, and Scepter.</p>
            <p>For even in the height of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his credit with her, how far was ſhe from permitting him (like a <hi>Remus)</hi> to leap over any wall of her new-built Anti-Rome; or with a young, and unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced <hi>genius</hi> to ſhuffle Pulpits, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Lawes, and other fundamentall eſtabliſhments of her Kingdomes, into any glorious apparances of will, or power? It ſhould ſeeme a foreſeeing, that howſoever this unexpected racking of people might for a time, in ſome particulars, both pleaſe, and adde a gloſſy ſtick to enlarge the Eagles neſt; yet that in the end all buildings above the truth, muſt neceſſarily have forced her two <hi>Supremacies,</hi> of ſtate, and nature, to deſcend, and through irregularities acted in her name, either become a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary between the world, and inferior perſons errors; or (as playing an after-game with her ſubjects, for a ſubject) conſtraine her to change the tenure of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:169718:106"/>
commanding power, into a kind of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>princely mediation. And for what? Even vanity to intreat her people, that they would hope well of diverſe confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: howſoever they might ſeem hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nay ignorant paſſions: and ſuch as threaten no leſſe, then a loſſe of native Liberties, deſcended upon her people, by the ſame preſcription of time and right, by which the Crowne had deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended upon her ſelfe, and her Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors; with a probable conſequence of many more ſharp pointed Tyrannies over them and their freedomes, then their happily deceaſed Parents ever taſted or dream't of.</p>
            <p>Beſides, admit theſe flatterings, and threatnings of hope, or feare (which tranſcendent power is ſometimes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to worke by) could have drawne this excellent Princeſſe, and her time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent ſubjects to make braſſe an equally currant ſtandard with gold, or ſilver, within her Sea compaſs'd Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; yet abroad, where the freedome
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:169718:106"/>
of other Soveraignties is bounded by Religion, Juſtice, and well-waigh'd commerce amongſt Neighbor-Princes, ſhe foreſaw, the leaſt thought of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying ſelf-Prerogatives, there would inſtantly be diſcredited and reflected back to ſtir up diſcouragement in the ſofteſt hearts, of her moſt humble and dutifull ſubjects.</p>
            <p>Therefore contrary to all theſe cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tived, and captiving apparances, this experienced Governeſſe of ours publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to the world, by a conſtant <hi>Series</hi> in her actions, that ſhe never was, nor ever would be overloaden with any ſuch exceſſes in her Perſon, or defects in her Government, as might conſtraine her to ſupport, or be ſupported by a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolous uſe of Favourites; as if ſhe would make any greater then her ſelfe, to governe Tyrannically by them.</p>
            <p>Nay more; ſo far off was ſhe from any lukewarmneſſe in Religion, as if a ſingle teſtimony may have credit, that bleſſed <hi>Queens</hi> many and free diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

with my ſelfe, ingeniouſly bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; that the unexpected converſion of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth fell fatally upon him, by the weakneſſes of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, and the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure miſcarriage of his Favourites. Who like Lapwings, with the ſhels of authority about their necks, were let looſe to runne over all the branches of his Kingdome, miſleading Governors, Nobility, and People from the ſteady, and mutuall reſt of Lawes, Cuſtomes, and other ancient wiſdomes of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, into the wilderneſſes of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and violence of will. Amongſt which defects, all fundamentall chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges (eſpecially of Religion) in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would be found (as ſhe conceived) the true diſcipline of Atheiſme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt their Subjects; all ſacrifices, obedience excepted, being but deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bought knowledges of the Serpent, to expulſe Kings, and People once againe out of Mediocrity, that reciprocall Paradiſe of mutuall humane duties.

Prophetically concluding, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will ſell God to purchaſe earth, by making that eternall unity of many ſhapes, muſt in the end make him of none: and ſo bee forced with loſſe, contempt and danger to traffique not for an heires place, but a younger bio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; in that Church, at whoſe wide gates he had (with ſhame enough) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready turned in.

Finally ſhe concluded that hollow Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be of ſuch a <hi>Bucephalus</hi> nature, as no Monarch ſhall be ever able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtride it, except onely the ſtirring <hi>Alexanders</hi> of time preſent, wherein the world is paſſing finely overſhot in her own bow.</p>
            <p>Wherefore to end, (as I began) with the caſe of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> was not this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Princeſſe therein a witneſſe to herſelfe, that ſhe never choſe, or cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed-Favourite, how worthy ſoever, to Monopolize over all the ſpirits, and buſineſſe of her Kingdome; or to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon the univerſall counſels of

Not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any one, eſpecially a Subject, better able to doe all then her ſelfe. Where like a worthy head of a great body, ſhe left the Offices, and Officers of the Crowne free to governe in their owne Predicaments, according to her truſt. Reſerving appeales to her ſelfe, as a Sea—mark to warn all Creatures under her that ſhee had ſtill a creating, or defacing power inherent in her Crown and Perſon, above thoſe ſubalterne places by which ſhee did miniſter uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall juſtice. And though her wiſdom was too deep to nurſe or ſuffer faction amongſt thoſe great Commanders, and diſtributers of Publique Rights: yet was ſhee as carefull not to permit any Ariſtocraticall cloud, or pillar, to ſhew, or ſhadow forth any ſuperſtitious, or falſe lights between her and her people.</p>

            <p>AGaine in her houſhold affaires ſhe kept the like equall hands ballancing the ſloth or ſumptuouſneſſe of her great Stewards, and white ſtaves, with the providence, and reſervedneſſe of a Lord Treaſurer, kept up the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles for Servants, Sutors, and for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors ſake in her owne houſe; not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering publike places to be made parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular farmes of private men, or the honor of her houſhold to be carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theirs: And withall, by the ſame reverend Auditor, ſhee watched over the nimble Spirits, ſelfe-ſeeking or large-handedneſſe of her active Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries; examining their Intelligence, money, Packets, Bils of tranſportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Propoſitions of State, which they offer'd up by their places, together with Sutes of other Natures, in her
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:169718:109"/>
wiſdome ſtill ſevering the deep buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from the ſpecious but narrow ſelfneſſe of inferior Officers.</p>
            <p>Beſides, all theſe were examined by reverend Magiſtrates, who having bin formerly iſſuers of her Majeſties Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the Secretaries places, did now worthily become Governours of her Finances, as beſt able to judge between the ſelfneſſe of place, or perſon, and the reall neceſſities of her State, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. A fine art of Government by well choſen Miniſters ſucceſſively to wall in her Exchequer from the vaſt expence of many things, eſpecially upon Forraigne Ambaſſadors, which (ſhe knèw) could neither bring reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, nor thankfulneſſe to their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne.</p>
            <p>Under which head of Forraigne, and Domeſtique Ambaſſadors, the anſwer wherewith that Majeſticall Lady enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the <hi>Polarke,</hi> expected a treating Ambaſſador, but proving (as ſhe told him) a defying Herald, is never to be
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:169718:110"/>
forgotten among Princes, as an inſtance how ſenſible they ought to be of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and how ready to put off ſuch ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den affronts, without a prompting of Councellors; againe worthily memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable among her Subjects, as a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative argument that ſhe would ſtill reſerve <hi>Moſes</hi> place entire to her ſelfe amongſt all the diſtributions of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thro.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to go on with her Domeſtique affaires how provident was ſhe, out of the like caution, and to the ſame end, that even hee who overſaw the reſt, might have his owne greatneſſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, and limited too. Whereupon ſhe forgot not to allay that vaſt power and jurisdiction of her Treaſurers Office, with inferior Officers of her Finances, and perchance under an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Favourits eyes, kept her owne; Beſides ſhe watched and checked him in his marriage made with <hi>Paulet</hi> his Predeceſſor, reſerved that mans ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and arrears as a rod over his
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:169718:110"/>
Grandchilds alliance, qualified, and brought the fines of his many, and great Copyholds to eaſie rates, would never ſuffer any propoſition to take hold of uniting the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> to her Exchequer, what narrow reaſons ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever were alleaged of ſparing and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the multiplicity of Officers, with their wages and ignorances or corruptions, all chargable, and cloudy paths, which the dealing with Princes moneys doth as naturally bring forth, as <hi>Africa</hi> doth Monſters. But like a provident Soveraigne, knowing that place in a Monarchy muſt help as well to traine up ſervants, as to reward, and encourage merit; ſhe conſtantly (to that end) keeps that Chancellor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Dutchy entire, and will not make the rewarding part of her Kingdome leſſe, to overload her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer with any addition of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall gaine amongſt under Officers, into whoſe barns thoſe harveſts are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the moſt part.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:169718:111"/>
Again with the ſame caution in all her doings ſhe made merit precious, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour dainty, and her graces paſſing rare, keeping them (as the Venetians doe their curiouſly refined gold) to ſet an edge upon the induſtry of man, and yet (like branches of Creation) ſparingly reſerved within the circuit of her Throne, as inherent, and tender Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, not fit to be left at randome in the power of ambitious Favourites, or low-looking Councellors, whoſe ends are ſeldome ſo large, or ſafe for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, as the native Princes Councels are, or ought to be.</p>
            <p>For her Clergy with their Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall, or Civill jurisdictions, ſhe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned the Arches, and Weſtminſter Hall to take ſuch care one to bound another, that they in limiting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, enlarged their Royalties, as the chiefe and equall foundations of both their greatneſſes; ſhe gave the ſuperior places freely, leſt by example ſhe ſhould teach them to commit ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:169718:111"/>
with their inferiors, and ſo adde ſcandall in ſtead of reputation to Gods Word, whoſe allowed Meſſengers they affect to ſeem.</p>
            <p>Her Parliaments ſhe uſed, to ſupply her neceſſarily expended treaſure, and withall, as Maps of orders, or diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, through her whole Kingdome. In which reverent Body (as I ſaid before) ſhe ſtudied not to make parties, or faction, advancing any preſent Royalliſt in the nether Houſe, to ſtir up envy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her ſelf amongſt all the reſt, and ſo publiſh the Crowne to uſe perſonall practiſes of hope, or feare, in theſe generall Councels of her Kingdome, but by forbearing art was never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with any artificiall brickwals from them; ſo as their need and fears concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with her occaſions, made their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and counſels concurre too, and out of thoſe equall, and common grounds forced every man to beleeve his private fiſh ponds could not be ſafe, whiles the publique ſtate of the Kingdome ſtood
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:169718:112"/>
in danger of preſent, or expectant extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
            <p>Her Councell-board (as an abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all other jurisdictions) ſhe held up in due honour, propounded not her great buſineſſes of State to them with any prejudicate reſolution, which once diſcovered, ſuppreſſeth the freedome both of ſpirit and judgment, but opens her ſelfe clearly, heares them with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; obſerves number, and reaſon, in their voices, and makes a quinteſſence of all their concords, or diſcords within her ſelfe, from whence the reſolutions and directions came ſuddenly, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly forth for execution.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, ſhe kept awe ſtirring over all her Courts, and other imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as her antidote againſt any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſity of puniſhments; In which arts of men, and Government, her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, education, and long experience, had made her become excellent above both Sexes.</p>
            <p>Againe, for the Regiment of her
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:169718:112"/>
Grandees at home, ſhe did not ſuffer the Nobility to be ſervants one to another, neither did her Gentry weare their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries as in the Ages before; their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and wealth was moderate, and their ſpirits and powers counterpoiſed with her Majeſty, from being Authors of any new Barons Wars, and yet reſerved as brave halfe paces between a Throne and a people.</p>
            <p>Her Yeomendry, a ſtate under her Nobles, and above her Peaſants (proper to England) ſhe maintained in their abilities, and never gave them cauſe to ſuſpect, ſhe had any intent, with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Taxes out of the courſe of Parliaments, inſenſibly to impoveriſh &amp; make Boors, or ſlaves of them, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſuch a kind of champion coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, would quickly ſtir up the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity it ſelfe, to become doubtfull of their owne fences, and by conſequence in danger, not only of holding lives, lands, goods, and Liberties at their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignes indefinite pleaſure, but by
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:169718:113"/>
ſuſpence of thoſe nurſing, and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Parliaments, to have all other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive birthrights, <hi>viz.</hi> Pulpits, Lawes, Cuſtomes, Voyces of Appeale, Audits of Trade, humble, and reverent mention of Coronation-oaths; legall publiſhers, and maintainers of War, true Maps of Diſeaſes, and cures through her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, with many other mutuall ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of honour, and uſe, between So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne, and ſubjects, like to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, or at leaſt metamorphoſed into Prerogative Taxes, wherein the people neither have voyces, nor valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able returne. I ſay, this home-borne Princeſſe of ours making her proſpect over theſe wilderneſſes of will, and power, providently for her ſelfe, and happily for us, refuſed the broad branch of <hi>Pythagoras Y,</hi> and choſe that narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but ſafer medium of State-aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, concluding that theſe two Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Houſes, were the only judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, faithfull, and induſtrious Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of unincroaching Monarchs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:169718:113"/>
So that it appears ſhe did not affect, nor yet would be drawne (like many of her ancient Neighbours the French Kings) to have her ſubjects give away their wealth after a new faſhion, <hi>viz.</hi> without returne of Pardons, eaſe of grievances, or comfort of Lawes, leſt her loving people might thereby dream of ſome ſecret intent to indennize their lives, wealth, and freedomes, into a ſhip of <hi>Athens,</hi> of which the name being old, and all riders, ſleepers, and other Timbers new, they were to be ſhipped downe a ſtreame of the like nature ever, and yet never the ſame. Beſides not to be ſhipped into that ſhip as Mariners, Souldiers, Saylors, or Factors, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as ſlaves, or conquered Out-Laws, with great diſhonour to the Legall, and Royall ſtate of Monarchicall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as ſhe conceived. From which example of chaſte power, we that live after this excellent Lady, may with great honour to her aſhes reſolve, that ſhe would have been as adverſe from

bearing the envy of printing any new Lines of Taxe, Impoſitions, Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or Mandats (without Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) upon her ancient coeleſtiall, or terreſtriall Globes, as her humble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects poſſibly could be, or wiſh her to be.</p>
            <p>Now if we ſhall examine the reaſon of her cutting between Lawes, Kings powers, and the Peoples freedome, by ſo even a thread, what can it be, but a long and happy deſcent within the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degrees of active Princes, together with the moderating education of Kings children in thoſe times; or laſtly in a quinteſſence of abilities, gathered out of thoſe bleſſed, and bleſſing mixtures of nature; Education, and Practice, which never faile to lift up man above man, and keep him there, more then place or power ſhall by any other encroaching advantages ever be able to doe.</p>
            <p>In which Map, as in a true perſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive glaſſe, this provident Princeſſe ſeeing both her owne part, and her
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:169718:114"/>
peoples, ſo equally, nay advantagiouſly already divided, and diſpoſed, ſhee thought it both wiſdome, and juſtice to leave them ballanced, and diſtinguiſhed as ſhe found them; Concluding that the leaſt change of <hi>Parallels,</hi> or <hi>Meridian</hi> Lines newly drawne upon any the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Globes of Monarchall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in abſence of Parliaments, would (like the ſervice of God in an unknown Language) prove prophaned, or miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; And conſequently regiſter ſuch a Map of writing, and blotting of irregular raiſing, and depreſſing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagious matching of things reall, and humours together, as muſt multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Atheiſme in humane duties, caſt trouble upon her Eſtate for want of reverence at home, and provoke this heavy cenſure through all the world <hi>(Spaine</hi> only excepted) that ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the raiſing of an inviſible Tyrant above the Monarch; and to that end had made this ſtep over Lawes, and Cuſtomes into ſuch a dangerous
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:169718:115"/>
kind of ignorant, and wandring confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as would quickly enforce man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, either to live like exhauſted creatures, deprived of Sabbaths, or like barren earth without priviledge of any Jubile, which metamorphoſing proſpect (as they thought) would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble <hi>Circes</hi> gueſts, transforme her people into divers ſhapes of beaſts; wherin they muſt loſe freedome, goods, fortune, language, and kinde, all at once.</p>
            <p>An inchanted confuſion imaged by the Poets, to warne Princes, that if they will eaſily be induced to uſe theſe racks of wit, and power indefinitly, and thereby force a free people into a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing eſtate, they muſt even in the pride of their Governments, looke in ſome ſort to be forced againe, either to ſacrifice theſe <hi>Empſons,</hi> and <hi>Dudleyes,</hi> as the moſt popular act ſuch Princes can doe, or elſe with the two edged ſword of Tyranny, irregularitie to climbe a degree yet higher then the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:169718:115"/>
truth, to maintaine theſe Caterpillars in eating, or offering up Religion, Lawes, &amp;c. to the covetous, cruell, or wanton exceſſes of encroaching Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as though God had made all the world for one.</p>
            <p>Nay more it pleaſed this provident Queen even curiouſly to foreſee, what face her eſtate was like to carry, if theſe biaced humours ſhould continue any long raigne over us, <hi>viz.</hi> contempt to be caſt over the Majeſty of the Crown, feare among the people, hate and envy againſt the reverend Magiſtrate, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement of domeſtique ſpirits to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny, or forraigne to invade upon any occaſion, the Court it ſelfe becomming a Farme, manured by drawing up, not the ſweet, but even the browes of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubjects; and laſtly the Councell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord, that glorious type of Civill Government, compelled to deſcend, and become Broker for money, executioner of extremity, better acquainted with the Merchant, or mechanicall ſcraping
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:169718:116"/>
Revenues of ſicke, and exhauſted King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, then forraigne Treaties, equall ballances of Trade, true grounds of Manufactures, myſteries of Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Exportation, differing ſtrengths, and weakneſſes of Crownes, alteration of Factions, or parties with advantage, danger of alliances made to the benefit of the ſtronger, the ſteady (though ſometimes intermittent) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings of the Conqueror, with all things elſe that concerne <hi>Magnalia Regni,</hi> and ſo apt inſtruments, not reverently to ſhew Princes the truth, but rather ſelf-loving creatures full of preſent and ſervile flatteries, even to the ruine of that Eſtate wherein they have and enjoy their honours.</p>
            <p>Which confuſion of place and things being cleerly imaged within her, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded this Lady to reſtrain the ſlaviſh Liberties of Tranſcendency, within Lawes, and Parliaments, as two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batter'd Rampires againſt all over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreſtings of power, or mutinies of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:169718:116"/>
people, and out of theſe grounds to conclude Prince-like, with her fore-fathers, that <hi>ſuperſtructiones antiquae nec facilè evertuntur, nec ſolae runnt.</hi> In this axiome making manifeſt to the world, that time preſents children, with their young, and unexperienced capacities, are much too narrow moulds, for any large branches of well-founded Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies to be altered, or new faſhioned in, the new and old ſeldome matching well together, let the Ciment of ſeeming wiſdome on either ſide appeare never ſo equall.</p>
            <p>Now for the right uſe of theſe high pillars, if we ſhall deſcend to inferior functions, we there find her (like a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſoule in a healthfull body) ſtill, all, in all, and all in every part. For with the ſame reſtraining providence, ſhe kept the Crowne from neceſſity to uſe Imperiall, and chargable Mandates upon her people, when ſhe had moſt need of their ſervice, contrary to the wiſdome of all Government; Neither
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:169718:117"/>
did ſhe by miſtaking, or miſapplying inſtances (gathered out of the fatall conqueſts of her Anceſtors) parallell her preſent need, and Levies with theirs, but wiſely conſidered that the King, and the people were then equally poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors of both Kealmes, and ſo in all impoſitions contributers to themſelves at the firſt hand.</p>
            <p>From which grounds, like a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and a contenting Soveraigne, ſhe acknowledged theſe differences to be reall, and accordingly by an equall audit taken from her itinerant Judges, with the Juſtices inhabiting in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, after ſhe was well informed of her ſubjects abilities, and her enemies threatnings, ſhe then, by advice of her Privy-Councell ſummon'd her Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, demanded ayd, and was never refuſed; In returne of which loving and free gifts, ſhe diſpoſed thoſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary helps to the repayring, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſionall ſupplying of her Forts along the Coaſt, with offenſive and defenſive
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:169718:117"/>
munitions, ſhe ſtored her Office of the Ordnance as a royall Magazine to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the whole Kingdom in extremity, and when there were no wars, yet ſhe kept it full, as an equall pledge of ſtrength, and reputation, both abroad, and at home.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, this Princeſſe being confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in theſe native Sea-walls of ours, fit to beare moving Bulwarkes in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial times, and in Civill Traffiques to carry out, and in, all Commodities with advantage; ſhe double ſtored her Navy Magazines with all materials, provided before-hand for ſuch workes, and things, as required time, and could not be bought with money; beſides, ſhe furniſhed her Sea Arſinals with all kind of ſtaple proviſions, as Ordnance, Pitch, Roſin, Tar, Maſts, Deale-boards, Cordage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the building, and maintaining of her Navie, flouriſhing in multitude of Ships for War and Trade.</p>
            <p>And as the life of that vaſt body,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:169718:118"/>
ſhe for encreaſe of Mariners, gave Princely countenance to all long voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, knowing they would neceſſarily require Ordnance, new munition, and burthen; and further to encourage this long-breathed worke, ſhe added out of her Exchequer an allowance of ſo much in the tun for the builders of any ſhips upward of ſo many hundred Tuns; She cheriſhed the fiſher-boats with privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges along her Coaſts, as nurſeries of Sea-men; brought <hi>Groniland,</hi> and <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found-land</hi> fiſhing in reputation to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe her ſtock of Mariners, both by taking, and tranſporting what they took far off.</p>
            <p>And for the Governours of her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy under the Admirall, as well in times of peace as war, ſhe choſe her princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Officers out of the gallanteſt Sea Commanders of that time, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhe knew taught them how to husband and guide her <hi>Muſcovy</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in generall Proviſions, not as partner with her Merchants in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:169718:118"/>
but reſtraining the Ship-keepers riot, or expence in harbour, and at Sea, how to furniſh, or martiall ſhips, and Mariners in all kind of Sea-fights to their beſt advantage.</p>
            <p>Beſides, through the ſame mens judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhe made all directions paſs for the divers moulds required in ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping betweene our Seas, and the Ocean, as the drawth of water, high, or low, diſpoſing of ports, cleanly roomes for Victuals, convenience of Deckes for Fight, or Trade, ſafe conveyance for Powder, &amp; all other munition, fit Stow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Sea ſtores, according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of heats, or colds in the Climes they were to reſide in, or paſſe through.</p>
            <p>Againe, as well to inſtruct the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines in their particular duties, as to keep a hand of Government over the large truſt, and charge committed to them, in all expeditions, the Ship with her furniture, tackling, and men, the Gunners Roome with all munition of that kind, the Boat-ſwains proviſion of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:169718:119"/>
Anchors, Cables, Canvas, and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores, the Purſers, Stewards, and Cooks Roomes touching victuals were delivered to the Captaines by Bill indented; the one part kept with the Officers of the Navy at home, the other in the hands of every private Captaine to examine his accounts by when he return'd: of which my ſelfe am wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as being well acquainted with the uſe of it in my youth, but utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the change ſince, or any reaſons of it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, this great Governeſſe could tell how to worke her high Admirals (without noiſe) to reſign their Patents, when the courſe of times made them in power, and gaine, ſeeme, or grow too exorbitant; yet kept ſhe up their Command at Sea, and when they were there made them a limited, or abſolute Commiſſion under the great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> ſometimes aſſociating, and qualifying their place, with a Councell of war of her own choice, and ever guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:169718:119"/>
the generalities of the Voyage with inſtructions proper to the buſineſs, and to be publiſhed at Sea in a time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed.</p>
            <p>Out of which caution in her prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall expeditions, ſhe ſtriving (as I ſaid) to allay that vaſt power of place with ſome inſenſible Counterpoiſe, many times joyned an active Favourite with that Sea <hi>Neptune</hi> of hers, making credit, place, and merit, finely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors in her ſervice; Beſides, ſhe well underſtanding the humours of both, temper'd them ſo equally one with another in her latter expeditions, as the Admirall being remiſſe, and apt to forgive all things, <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſeverely true to Martiall Diſcipline, and loath to wound it by forgiving petty errours under that implacable Tyrant <hi>Mars,</hi> in all likelihood her Fleet could hardly be over ſailed, or under ballaſted, and conſequently the Crowne (in her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence) was ſure to be guarded with more eyes than two, to prevent confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:169718:120"/>
in Martiall Affaires; where eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ship proves beyond the amendment of ſecond thoughts, and ſo fatall to that ſtate which paies, and negligently ventures.</p>
            <p>The Merchant-part of her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was oppreſſed with few impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Companies free to chooſe their owne Officers, to faſhion their Trade, aſſiſted with the name and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of her Embaſſadors, the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, and returne of their induſtry, and adventures, contenting them in a free Market without any nearer cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of peoples induſtry to the quick.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fluſhingers,</hi> and <hi>Dunkerkers</hi> in ſucceſſion of time, it is true, did much afflict their Traffique, though with ſmal ſtrength; whereupon ſhe firſt travelled to ſuppreſſe them by force, but found the Charge grow infinite, and the cure ſo caſuall, as ſhe joyned Treaty with the Sword, and ſet her Seas by that providence, and induſtry, once againe at liberty from all moleſtation, or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Pyrates.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:169718:120"/>
Her Univerſities were troubled with few <hi>Mandates,</hi> the <hi>Colledges</hi> free in all their Elections, and governed by their own Statutes, the groſſe neglect of uſing the Latine Tongue ſhe ſtudied to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, as well for honour of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, as for her own ſervice in all Treaties with Forraign Princes, ſhe ſtudied to multiply her <hi>Civilians</hi> with little charge, and yet better allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to their Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>In a word, ſhe preſerved her Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without waving, kept both her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, and Civill Goverment intire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove neglect, or practice, by which, with a multitude of like inſtances, ſhe manifeſted to the World, that the well governing of Princes own Inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is (in the cleare houſe of Fame) ſuperiour to all the far noiſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of her over-griping Anceſtors, ſince what Man lives, converſant in the <hi>Calenders</hi> of eſtates, but muſt know, that had not theſe wind-blown con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of ours happily been ſcattered,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:169718:121"/>
they muſt in time have turned the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate wealth, and degrees of <hi>England</hi> into the naſty poverty of the French peaſants; brought home Mandates in ſtead of Lawes, waved our freedomes in Parliaments with new chriſtned Impoſitions, and in the end have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected native and active <hi>Albion</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Province, and ſo inferior to her owne dearly bought forraign conqueſts, being forced to yeeld up the ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive works of power, to the equall Laws of Nature, which almoſt every where <hi>(America</hi> excepted) proclames the greater to be naturally a Law-giver over the leſſe.</p>

            <p>YEt as this wiſe and moderate Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſſe was far from incroaching upon any other Princes Dominions, ſo wanted ſhe neither foreſight, courage nor might, both to ſuppreſſe all inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies attempted againſt her ſelfe, and to ſupport her Neighbours unjuſtly oppreſſed, whereof by the Readers pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience I will here adde ſome few inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>She had no ſooner perfected her Virgin-triumph over that ſanctified, and invincible Navy, and by that loſſe publiſhed the Spaniſh ambition, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and malice to all Chriſtendome, ſecured her owne eſtate, revived the Netherlands, confuted the Pope, turned the caution of the Italian Princes the right way, and amazed the world; but even then to purſue that victory, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:169718:122"/>
prevent her enemies ambition, which ſtill threatned the world with new Fleets; then (I ſay) did this active Lady conclude, with adviſe of her Councell, and applauſe of her Kingdome, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her ſelfe thenceforth by invading, and no more attend the Conquerors pleaſure at her owne doores.</p>
            <p>Out of which reſolution ſhe firſt ſent forth the Earle of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> who attempted the ſurprize of <hi>Porto Ricco,</hi> accompliſhed it with honour, and ſo might have kept it, had not diſeaſe, and diſorder proved more dangerous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to him, then the great name, and ſmall force of the Spaniſh did.</p>
            <p>Againe to prevent danger, not in the bud, but roor, ſhe tooke upon her the protection of <hi>Don Antonio</hi> King of <hi>Portugall,</hi> ſent Sir <hi>Iohn Norris,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> with a Royall Fleet, and eleven thouſand men to land, ſeconded with the fortune, and countenance of the Earle of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> they tooke the baſe Towne of the Groyne, and when they
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:169718:122"/>
had overthrowne all that came to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour it, and burnt the Countrey, then marched they on to <hi>Lisbone,</hi> and in that journey ſacked <hi>Penicke,</hi> waſted Villages, and Provinces, entred the ſuburbs of <hi>Lisbone</hi> even to the gates of the High Towne, and burnt threeſcore Spaniſh hulkes full of proviſions.</p>
            <p>And to the ſame end, ſhe did, and ſtill meant ſucceſſively to maintaine a Fleet of her owne Ships, and her faſt friends the Netherlands upon his Coaſts, not only to diſturbe the returne of victuals, munition, and materials for War, with which the Empire, Poland, and the Hanſe Townes did uſually, and fatally (even to themſelves) furniſh this growing Monarch, but withall to keep his Navy which was riding, and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in many havens, from poſſibility of getting head in any one place to annoy her; and thirdly to ſet ſuch a Taxe upon the wafting home of his Indian Fleets, as might (in ſome meaſure) qualifie that fearfull abundance which elſe was like
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:169718:123"/>
enough to ſpread infection through the ſoundeſt Councels, and Councellors of all his Neighbour-Princes.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, the French King <hi>Henry</hi> the third (heartned by her exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſucceſſe) did encounter the <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſards,</hi> a ſtrong Faction depending upon <hi>Spaine.</hi> And when he was made away by treaſon, &amp; the Leagues in Armes under the Spaniards protection, then did the Queen providently take opportunity to change the Seat of her Warres, and aſſiſted <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, the ſucceeding King, by the Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> untill he was able to ſubſiſt by himſelfe, and till, by her ſupport he was ſtrengthened, both to overthrow the League, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſecond ballance againſt the great, and vaſt deſires of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither did ſhe reſt here, or give him breath, but with a Fleet of one hundred and fifty Sayle, and a ſtrong Land-army, ſent the Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of <hi>England</hi> to invade <hi>Spaine</hi> it ſelfe, they tooke <hi>Cales,</hi> ſpoiled his Fleet of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:169718:123"/>
twenty Gallyes, and fifty nine Ships, the riches whereof were valued at twelve millions of Duckets. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after, imployed ſhe not the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> with a Fleet to the Iſlands? In which Voyage he ſacked <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> tooke prizes to the value of foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Duckets at the leaſt.</p>
            <p>Now when this Spaniſh Invader found himſelfe thus well paid with his owne coyne, and ſo forced to divert the provoked hand of that famous Queen held over him, by ſtirring up <hi>Tirone</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> to which end he ſent money, and Forces under <hi>Don Iohn d' Aquila,</hi> even then that Lady, firſt by <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and after by <hi>Montjoy,</hi> overthrew the Iriſh, and ſent home the Spaniard well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced with loſſe, and diſhonour for aſſiſting her Rebels.</p>
            <p>By which and the like active cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of hers in ſucceſſive, and ſucceſſefull undertakings, that provident Lady both bore out the charge of all thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions, requited his Invaſion, clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:169718:124"/>
the fearfull wings of this growing Monarch, and made his credit ſwell through all the mony-banks of Europe, cauſing withall as low an Ebbe of his treaſure.</p>
            <p>Againe by this impriſoning of the Lyon within his owne den, ſhe did not only leſſen his reputation (a chiefe ſtrength of growing Monarchs) but diſcovered ſuch a light as perchance might have forced him in time, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Titles of his Uſurpations at home, and have given <hi>Portugall, Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> and <hi>Granoda</hi> opportunity to plead their rights with <hi>Caſtile</hi> in the Courts of <hi>Mars,</hi> if God had either lengthened the dayes of that worthy Lady who underſtood him, or time not neglected her wiſdome ſo ſuddenly, by exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that active, victorious, enriching, and ballancing courſe of her defenſive Wars, for an idle (I feare) deceiving ſhadow of peace. In which whether we already languiſh, or live impoveriſhed, whilſt he growes potent, and rich, by
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:169718:124"/>
the fatall ſecurity of all Chriſtendome, they that ſhall ſucceed us, are like to feele, and judge freely.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee how our famous <hi>Iudith</hi> diſperſed the terrour of this <hi>Holofer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> like a cloud full of wind, and by a Princely wakefulneſſe, preſerved all thoſe Soveraigne States that were in league with her, from the dangerous temptations of power, wealth, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, by which the growing Monarchs doe often intangle the inferior, but yet Soveraigne Princes. And amongſt the reſt, from that uſefull traffique of his Leiger Embaſſadors, who trained up in the nimble exchange of Intelligence, grow to be of ſuch a <hi>Bucephalus</hi> nature, ſo like <hi>Rome,</hi> as I ſaid before, a body of ſuch members, as the <hi>Alexanders</hi> of their time can only mannage, and make uſe of; Inſtance <hi>Mendoſa,</hi> in whom ſhe had long before diſcovered, and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited all practiſes of thoſe ſpecious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of Conquerers Agents.</p>
            <p>Beſides in honour of her be it ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:169718:125"/>
did not this mirrour of Juſtice, by reſtraining that naturall ambition of getting other Princes rights, within the naturall bounds of well-governing her owne, become a beame of ſuch cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, as moſt of the Kings, or States then raigning, freely yeelded; both to weigh their owne intereſts within the ſcales of her judgment, and beſides to aſſiſt her in bounding out the Imperiall Meeres of all Princes by the ancient preceſſion of Right, and power.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, did ſhe not purchaſe the like reputation even amongſt the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and by it deſtroy'd a neſt, which this aſpiring Monarch began to build in the Seraglio of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> For ſhe thinking it no wiſdome to look on, and ſee his Spaniſh piſtols pierce into ſo high a mountaine of Forces, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of them at his pleaſure, provident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opened the ſtronger Monarchs eyes to diſcover how craftily the weaker wrought his ends at the coſt of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, or ſleepy Princes about her.</p>
            <p>

Yet did not this Soveraigne Lady intercept his deſignes from under any Goddeſſe ſhield (whom <hi>Homer</hi> makes the Grecian Worthies ſhoot, and hit) but diſplanted him by a gallant Factor of her Merchants in a league of Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique, and prevailed to make his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador landed at <hi>Raguſa,</hi> houſed in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and all under protection of <hi>Ferrat</hi> chiefe Viſier, yet, and upon a contract of thirty thouſand zecchins already paid him, glad to returne, and ſhippe himſelfe away, with more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then he landed.</p>
            <p>Beſides which reputation given to her name by the Grand Signior in this particular, ſhe generally got power to keep this fearfull Standard of the halfe Moon waving in ſuch manner over all the King of Spaines deſignes, as he durſt move no where againſt his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Chriſtian Princes, for feare of being incompaſſed within the horns of the heathen Creſcent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:169718:126"/>
But theſe things ſwell, and require a more authenticall Hiſtory, to continue the memory of that wonder of Queens, and women; in honour of whoſe ſacred name, I have preſumed thus to digreſſe, and admoniſh all Eſtates by her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, how they may draw uſe, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, both from the dead, and the living, the change of times having no power over reall wiſdomes, but infinite over the ſhadowes of craft, and humours of petty States, which commonly follow the greater Bodies, as they are unequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extended, or contracted about them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore now to conclude theſe Heroicall Enterpriſes abroad, together with the reformations of her State at home, the refining of the Engliſh Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard embaſed by her ſiſter, the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of her Crown-Revenue intire, her wiſdome in the change of Lawes, without change of dangers, the timely and Princely help ſhe gave to <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth when he had nothing but
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:169718:126"/>
the Towne of <hi>Diepe</hi> left him, his credit, and meanes being utterly exhauſted, and ſo that brave King ready, either to take Sea, and eſcape, or flye for ſuccour into <hi>England,</hi> her conſtant eſtabliſhment of Religion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> driving the Spaniſh Forces divers times from thence, who were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly ſent as well to ſtirre up her ſubjects to rebell as to maintaine, and ſupport them in it, together with the former recited particulars, howſoever improperly diſperſed, or bundled up together, yet are in their natures of ſo rare a wiſdome, as I beleeve they will ſtill be more and more admired, and juſtly in that excellent Princeſſe, even many Ages after her death.</p>
            <p>Thus have I by the Readers pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, given that Aegyptian, and Roman Tragedy a much more honourable ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulture, then it could ever have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, eſpecially in making their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to attend upon my Soveraignes herſe, without any other hope of being,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:169718:127"/>
then to wait upon her life, and death, as their Maker did, who hath ever ſince been dying to all thoſe glories of Life which he formerly enjoyed, under the bleſſed, and bleſſing preſence of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matchable Queen and woman.</p>
            <p>Now if any man ſhall demand why I did not rather leave unto the world a complete hiſtory of her Life, then this ſhort memoriall in ſuch ſcatter'd, and undiſgeſted minutes, let him receive this anſwer from a dead man, becauſe I am confident no fleſh breathing (by ſeeing what is done) ſhall have occaſion of asking that queſtion, whileſt I am living. Preſently after the death of my moſt gracious Queen, and Miſtreſs, the falſe ſpirits, and apparitions of idle griefe haunted me exceedingly, and made all things ſeeme either greater, or leſſe then they were; ſo that the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I went, the more diſcomfortable I found thoſe new reſolutions of time, to my decayed, and diſproportioned abilities; yet fearing to be curſed with
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:169718:127"/>
the Figg-tree, if I bore no fruit, I rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed up my thoughts upon an ancient axiome of Wiſe men; <hi>Si quicquid offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, relinquimus citò; inerti otio torpebit vita;</hi> and upon a ſecond review of the world, called to mind the many duties I ought to that matchleſſe Soveraigne of mine, with a reſolution to write her life in this manner.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſeriouſly to have begun with the uniting of the Red, and White Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in the marriage of <hi>Hen:</hi> the ſeventh; In the like manner to have run over <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths time, untill his ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rents in the Church, with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to have demurr'd more ſeriouſly upon the ſudden change in his Sonne <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, from ſuperſtition to the eſtabliſhment of Gods Ancient, Catholique, and Primitive Church; thoſe cobwebs of re-converſion in Queen <hi>Maryes</hi> dayes, I had no intent to meddle with, but only by pre-occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation to ſhew, that Princes captived
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:169718:128"/>
in Nature, can ſeldome keep any thing free in their Governments, but as ſoyles manured to bring forth ill weeds apace, muſt live to ſee Schiſme ariſe in the Church, wearing out the reall branches of immortall truth, to weave in the thin leaves of mortall ſuperſtition, and to behold in the State all their faireſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtries ſpring, and fade together, like Ferne-ſeed; Laſtly, I intended with ſuch ſpirits, as Age had left me, to revive my ſelf in her memory, under whom I was bred.</p>
            <p>Now in this courſe, becauſe I knew, that as the liberality of Kings did help to cover many errours, ſo truth in a ſtory would make good many other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in the writer. I adventured to move the Secretary, that I might have his favour to peruſe all obſolete Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Councell cheſt, from thoſe times downe as near to theſe, as he in his wiſdome ſhould think fit; hee firſt friendly required my end in it, which I
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:169718:128"/>
as freely delivered him, as I have now done to you.</p>
            <p>Againſt her memory he, of all men, had no reaſon to keep a ſtrict hand, and where to beſtow a Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> ſervant with leſſe diſadvantage to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe it ſeems readily appeared not; ſo that my abrupt motion tooke hold of his preſent Counſell. For he liberally granted my requeſt, and appointed me that day three weeks to come for his warrant, which I did, and then found in ſhew a more familiar, and gracefull aſpect then before, he deſcending to queſtion me, why I would dreame out my time in writing a ſtory, being as like to riſe in this time as any man he knew; Then in a more ſerious, and friendly manner examining me, how I could cleerly deliver many things done in that time, which might perchance be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued to the prejudice of this.</p>
            <p>I ſhortly made anſwer, that I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an Hiſtorian was bound to tell no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:169718:129"/>
but the truth, but to tell all truths were both juſtly to wrong, and offend not only Princes, and States, but to blemiſh, and ſtir up againſt himſelfe, the frailty and tenderneſſe, not only of particular men, but of many Families, with the ſpirit of an <hi>Athenian Timon;</hi> And therefore ſhewed my ſelfe ſo far from being diſcouraged with that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, as I took upon me freely to adventure all my own goods in this Ship, which was to be of my owne building. Immediately this Noble Secretary, as it ſeems, moved, but not removed with thoſe ſelfeneſſe of my opinion, ſeriouſly aſſured me, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſecond thoughts he durſt not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to let the Councell-cheſt lie open to any man living, without his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties knowledge and approbation.</p>
            <p>With this ſuperſedeas I humbly took my leave, at the firſt ſight aſſuring my ſelfe this laſt project of his would neceſſarily require ſheet after ſheet to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:169718:129"/>
be viewed, which I had no confidence in my own powers to abide the hazard of; and herein it may pleaſe the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to beleeve me the rather by theſe Pamphlets, which having ſlept out my own time, if they happen to be ſeene hereafter, ſhall at their own perill riſe upon the ſtage, when I am not; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, in the ſame propoſition I further ſaw, that the many Judgements, which thoſe <hi>Embryoes</hi> of mine muſt probably have paſt through, would have brought forth ſuch a world of alterations, as in the end the worke it ſelfe would have proved a ſtory of other mens writing, wity my name only to put to it, and ſo a worſhip of time, not a voluntary ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of duty.</p>
            <p>Farther I cannot juſtifie theſe little ſparkes, unworthy of her, and unfit for me; ſo that I muſt conclude with this ingenuous <hi>Confeſsion,</hi> that it grieves me to know I ſhall (as far as this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Apology extends) live, and dye
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:169718:130"/>
upon equall tearmes with a Queene, and Creature ſo many waies unequall, nay, infinitely ſuperiour to me, both in Nature, and Fortune.</p>

            <p>NOw to return to the Tragedies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, my purpoſe in them was, not (with the Ancient) to exemplifie the diſaſtrous miſeries of mans life, where Order, Lawes, Doctrine, and Authority are unable to protect Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency from the exorbitant wickedneſſe of power, and ſo out of that melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike Viſion, ſtir horrour, or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur againſt Divine Providence: nor yet (with the Moderne) to point out Gods revenging aſpect upon every particular ſin, to the deſpaire, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of mortality; but rather to trace out the high waies of ambitious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:169718:130"/>
and to ſhew in the practice, that the more audacity, advantage, and good ſucceſſe ſuch Soveraignties have, the more they haſten to their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation and ruine.</p>
            <p>So that to this abſtract end, finding all little inſtruments in diſcovery of great bodies to be ſeldome without er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, I preſumed, or it rather eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped me, to make my Images beyond the ordinary ſtature of exceſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in again that women are predominant, is not for malice, or ill talent to their Sexe; But as Poets figured the vertues to be women, all Nations call them by Feminine names, ſo have I deſcribed malice, craft, and ſuch like vices in the perſons of Shrews, to ſhew that many of them are of that nature, even as we are, I meane ſtrong in weakneſſe; and conſequently in theſe Orbes of Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the weaker Sexe, commonly the moſt predominant; yet as I have not made all women good with <hi>Euripides,</hi>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:169718:131"/>
ſo have I not made them all evill with <hi>Sophocles,</hi> but mixt of ſuch ſorts as we find both them, and our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Againe, for the Arguments of theſe Tragedies they be not naked, and caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, like the Greeke, and Latine, nor (I confeſſe) contrived with the variety, and unexpected encounters of the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, but nearer Level'd to thoſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, councels, and practices, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I thought fitter to hold the attention of the Reader, than in the ſtrangeneſs, or perplexedneſs of witty Fictions; In which the affections, or imagination, may perchance find exerciſe, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, but the memory and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment no enriching at all; Beſides, I conceived theſe delicate Images to be over-abundantly furniſhed in all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages already.</p>
            <p>And my Noble Friend had that dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, even with the daſhes of his pen to make the <hi>Arcadian</hi> Antiques beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Margents of his works; yet the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:169718:131"/>
honour which (I beare him record) he never affected, I leave unto him, with this addition, that his end in them was not vaniſhing pleaſure alone, but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Images, and Examples, (as dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting threds) to guide every man through the confuſed <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of his own deſires, and life: So that how ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I liked them not too well (even in that unperfected ſhape they were) to condeſcend that ſuch delicate (though inferior) Pictures of himſelfe, ſhould be ſuppreſſed; yet I do wiſh that work may be the laſt in this kind, preſuming no man that followes can ever reach, much leſſe go beyond that excellent intended patterne of his.</p>
            <p>For my own part, I found my cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Genius more fixed upon the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Life, than the Images of Wit, and therefore choſe not to write to them on whoſe foot the black Oxe had not already trod, as the Proverbe is, but to thoſe only, that are weather-beaten
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:169718:132"/>
in the Sea of this World, ſuch as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loft the ſight of their Gardens, and groves, ſtudy to ſaile on a right courſe among Rocks, and quick-ſands; And if in this ordaining, and ordering mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and forme together for the uſe of life, I have made thoſe Tragedies, no Plaies for the Stage, be it known, it was no part of my purpoſe to write for them, againſt whom ſo many good, and great ſpirits have already written.</p>
            <p>But he that will behold theſe Acts upon their true Stage, let him look on that Stage wherein himſelf is an Actor, even the ſtate he lives in, and for every part he may perchance find a Player, and for every Line (it may be) an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of life, beyond the Authors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, or application, the vices of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages being ſo like to theſe of this Age, as it will be eaſie to find out ſome affinity, or reſemblance between them, which whoſoever readeth with this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, will not perchance thinke
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:169718:132"/>
the Scenes too large, at leaſt the matter not to be exceeded in account of words.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, for the Stile; as it is rich, or poore, according to the eſtate, and ability of the Writer, ſo the value of it ſhall be enhanſed, or cried downe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the grace, and the capacity of the Reader, from which common Fortune of Bookes, I look for no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption.</p>
            <p>But to conclude, as I began this worke, to entertaine, and inſtruct my ſelfe, ſo if any other find entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or profit by it, let him uſe it freely, judge honourably of my friend, and moderately of me, which is all the returne that out of this barren Stock can be deſired, or expected.</p>
