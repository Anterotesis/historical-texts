         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ittle did any man think when the diſpute between

<hi>that it would ſuddenly come to this question
(between Papiſts and Proteſtants</hi>) VVhether
there be any ſuch thing in the world as a Proteſtant Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
and conſequently whether any true Church, or faith,
or ſacraments be to be had out of the Church of Rome.</p>
            <p>I dare ſay that thoſe who heard the publick diſpute at
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> did as little foreſee this, as the Reverend au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of <hi>Schiſm diſpatcht</hi> did think that the controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and <hi>S. VV.</hi> (with thoſe other Romaniſts who
have writ againſt him, about <hi>infallibility</hi> and <hi>ſchiſm</hi>)
would end in this debate, <hi>VVhether we may give as much
credit in matter of fact to 24 of the ancient Fathers of
the Greek and Latin Church, as to 12 country Yeomen
on a Jury.</hi> The Protestant affirming this, the Papist deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it. But ſo it is; and ſo it appears by theſe two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

ſaith not one word in defenſe of any Sect, but only the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right

            <head>A Memorable Advertiſement from Dorſetſhire.</head>
            <p>IN <hi>September</hi> laſt 1659 there was a ſtrange diſcovery made of divers <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
in and neer the Town of <hi>Sherburne</hi> in <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> there being neer
200. of them at one meeting, moſt of them Quakers and Anabaptiſts. Three
Men and two Women formerly Quakers, committed to <hi>Dorchester Goale</hi>
where they now are priſoners, have confeſſed upon their examination
and ſince their commitment to ſundry perſons of quality who have viſited
them,</p>
            <p>1. That when the Devill firſt appeared to, and tempted them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Witches; He firſt of all perſwaded them; to <hi>renounce their Baptiſme</hi>
and no wonder, becauſe in it they <hi>renounced the Divel and all his works, with
all the ſinfull lusts of the fleſh:</hi> which they did <hi>Actually renounce before they
made a contract with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That the Devil did often viſibly appear to them in ſundry formes (and
perſwaded them as he <hi>Matth. 4. 8, 9, 10. Luc.</hi> 4. 5, 6, 7, 8. tempted our
Saviour) to <hi>fall down and worſhip him,</hi> which they did.</p>
            <p>3. That he inſtigated them to torment, bewitch and deſtroy as his and
their greateſt enemy Mr. <hi>Lyford</hi> late Miniſter of <hi>Sherburne,</hi> a learned, pio us
Orthodox, painfull Divine, being tormented with a painfull and ſharpe
diſeaſe of which he dyed; and Mr. <hi>Bamfield</hi> his ſucceſſour a very godly
laborious Miniſter, whom they have forced by their Witchcrafts to deſert
the Town.</p>
            <p>4. The two Women confeſs to all, <hi>that the Divel hath oft times had Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
copulation</hi> with them in <hi>ſundry ſhapes;</hi> but moſt commonly in the ſhape of
Mr. <hi>Lyford</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bamfield,</hi> the Miniſters of <hi>Sherburne,</hi> whom he and they
moſt hated and endeavoured to deſtroy.</p>
            <p>5. The Devil ſince their impriſonment hath frequently appeared to
them all, and actually poſſeſſed them, bruiſing, tearing like the unclean
Spirit <hi>Mar.</hi> 9. 18. to the 28. <hi>Luc.</hi> 9. 39. 42. &amp;c. <hi>toſſing them</hi> frequently <hi>up &amp;
down the priſon in a strange manner,</hi> tormenting them with ſtrange fits of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions,
quakings, ſhakings in all their joynts, and ſwellings in their whole
bodies, that <hi>their skins are ready to break,</hi> which makes them cry out and
roar with great horror, as divers <hi>eye-witneſſes of quality attest.</hi> And if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous
Mr. <hi>Denne,</hi> or any other Quakers doubt the truth of it, if they
pleaſe to viſit them at <hi>Dorchester,</hi> they will be enforced to confeſs it, and
give glory unto God for his diſcovery of the evillneſs of the way and ſect
of Quakers.</p>

               <salute>Sir;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>§. 1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His day I met with a decree of the Pope, condemning
the late <hi>Apology for the Jeſuits</hi> (which was printed in
anſwer to <hi>Montalto's</hi> myſtery of Jeſuitiſme) and
threatning all who dare read or keep it; but withall
I met with a <hi>new</hi> Apology for the ſame perſons with
your name prefixed. Wherein wondring to find ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
aſperſions caſt upon ſundry of the Jeſuites adverſaries (among the
reſt upon <hi>Mr. Tho. Smith</hi>) I reſolved to ſpend an hour or two in vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them and the <hi>Church of England;</hi> which (in favour to the flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Romiſh <hi>Mistriſs</hi> and <hi>idolatry</hi>) you think fit to call their fading Miſtriſs
and idol.</p>
            <p>2. And here if I ſhould imitate you, I ſhould ſuperſcribe this, <hi>To my
frivolous and learned friend, H. D. Mr. of Arts and ſenior Soph. Captain and
Apothecary, farmer and Miniſter, the reverend Apologiſt for the Society of
Jeſus.</hi> But counting it no virtue to imitate you in this kind, I ſhall
only take notice of ſuch paſſages as may appear to ſome weak people to
be pertinent.</p>
            <p>3. In the firſt page, you tell us that the Tinker mendeth ſoules;
though you can not but know if you have read over that book which you
pretend to anſwer (which I much doubt) that this Tinker p. 297. l. 21.
of his book entituled <hi>Law and Goſpel,</hi> adviſeth his convert in theſe words
<q>come to Christ even as filthy as ever thou canst:<hi> that is (if I underſtand En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh)</hi>when you have ſworn a vain oath and would go to prayer for pardon of
that ſin, first stab your Father, then poiſon your Mother, lie with your ſiſter:
and then go confidently to Church, but not before.</q> If Mr. <hi>D.</hi> have read this
or thoſe other ſtrange paſſages of this <hi>T</hi>'s. <hi>ſermon</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
diſarmed,</hi> or (if he'l not believe that relation) if he'l credit his own
eyes, and ſee what the ſame Tinker ſaith againſt Chriſt's oration (<hi>Mat.</hi> 25.
35. 42.) and againſt the neceſſity of good works p. 65. 66. 99. 100. 101.
151. 304. 311. methinks he ſhould not ſay this Tinker <hi>mends ſoules;</hi> unleſs
he mean that he mendeth them juſt as he mends kettles, that is, ſtopping
one hole and making many.</p>
            <p>4. In the next place <hi>H. D.</hi> blames Mr. <hi>S.</hi> for <hi>proving that none may preach
unleſs they be ſent, when</hi> (quoth he) <hi>the T. is of the ſame mind.</hi> I anſwer
that the <hi>T.</hi> did deny it, till Mr. S. had proved it; or at leaſt he bid him
prove it. And Mr. S. wa perſwaded (and ſtill is) that Mr. <hi>E.</hi> to whom
<pb facs="tcp:167147:4"/>
that letter was writ did not believe the neceſſity of any omiſſion.</p>
            <p>5. Whereas you would fain invalidate Mr. <hi>Smiths</hi> ordination, you
may ſuppoſe him ordeined by <hi>Bp. Hall;</hi> and then when you have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerd
<hi>Maſon de miniſterio Anglicano, Dr. Fern</hi> againſt <hi>Champney,</hi> and the
vindications of our Reformation and Orders which are writ by <hi>Bp. Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi>
and <hi>Dr. Heylin,</hi> 'tis very probable you ſhall receive Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of your queſtions. Till then he who thinks you have not
vouchſafed to read that ſmal book which you pretend to anſwer &amp; profeſs
magiſterially to cenſure, can not believe that you'l find leiſure to read his
determinations of ſuch queſtions. And he hath not ſo much ſpare time as
you, to write and print books only for his own reading.</p>
            <p>6. Mean while I muſt tell you, that one reaſon why I think you have
not read over the <hi>Quaker diſarmed,</hi> is becauſe you put a caſe and three
queries in your 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. page, which are anſwerd in the letter to Mr. <hi>E</hi> §. 35.
Yet for your more abundant ſatisfaction Ile anſwer them more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
by aſſerting. 1. That in your caſe the preaching of thoſe ſhipwrackt
men to pagans is no ſin. 2ly. That in ſuch extraordinary caſes 'tis law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for ſuch a Congregation to chooſe their Teachers. 3ly. That ſuch a
Congregation may find fitting men, full of faith, to preach unto unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;
eſpecially if the ſhipwrackt men have recourſe, as ſoon as they
can, to the Church, to ordein them: as <hi>Frumentius</hi> and <hi>Aedeſius</hi> did who
are mentioned in the letter to Mr. <hi>E.</hi> afore-cited.</p>
            <p>7. But <hi>H. D.</hi> muſt give me leave to tell him, that that man hath an ill
mind who being in a ſhip well orderd, uſurpeth the Maſters or Pilots
place, and takes to himſelf what portion of the fraight he pleaſes; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly
becauſe a veſſell ſhipwrackt is ſometimes thought a <hi>lawfull</hi> prey by
the people on the ſhore: And I wonder that theſe words ſhould come
from one that pretends to be a Miniſter of the Goſpel, unleſs he would
imply that he hath an eager mind to ſhipwrack an <hi>entire</hi> veſſell under
faile.</p>
            <p>8. Whereas in your 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. page you fall foul upon Mr. <hi>S.</hi> for diſputing
with Quakers; you muſt know, that thoſe your friends did not only
challenge him and all the Clergy in <hi>England</hi> in print (<hi>G. Fox's myſtery</hi>
in folio p. 19. preface) but ſet up their bills of defiance upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement
and School doors. Nay the Maiors Wife and divers other
Quakers were importunate with Mr. <hi>S.</hi> to diſpute (who half an hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the on ſet reſolved to decline it) and the Maior himſelf told Mr. <hi>S.</hi>
that he was glad he would undertake them, for he had oft ſaid that <hi>they
were ſo inſolent becauſe no man meddled with them.</hi> And the caſe ſtanding
thus (as Mr. <hi>James Alders</hi> and many others can witneſs) I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſee your determination; and what you have to ſay againſt <hi>S. Paul,</hi>
who ſaith 'tis the duty of a Miniſter not only to exhort but to <hi>confute</hi>
gainſayers <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:167147:4"/>
9. For the argument of three hees ſee p. 2. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> did not ſay, that this
was the only way of proof, but that it was one; He did not ſay, that all
three hee's be three perſons, but that all hees which be in <hi>Heaven</hi> are
ſuch. You may ſee they were then ſpeaking of the three that bear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
in <hi>Heaven;</hi> and I hope Mr. <hi>H. D.</hi> will ſtable none of his troop-<hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
in <hi>Heaven</hi> though they come into Pauls.</p>
            <p>10. In your 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. §. you would cleer <hi>G. W.</hi> from being a Papiſt becauſe
you ſay he would take <hi>no</hi> oath <hi>Anſ.</hi> Others think that he will take an
oath when 'tis for his advantage, as you may ſee in the queries; and if
that be true, (as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> hath reaſon to believe it) I know no reaſon why
he ſhould refuſe the oath unleſs he be a Papiſt. Nor would Mr. <hi>S.</hi>
I believe have mentioned that oath to him, if he had not been aſſured that
<hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>H. D.</hi> are both alike bitter enemies to the old moderate way
of tryal, appointed by the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and if you be ſo, I am
yet to learn what other way, beſide this oath, he <hi>could</hi> have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
            <p>11. To your 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. §. where you ask <hi>who can make ſenſe of the ſtory of the
twelve Embaſſadours;</hi> I anſwer any man but Mr. <hi>D.</hi> who is unwilling. To
the reſt of this §. beſides what you have been told before [p. 2. l. 24.] I
reply, that though the Father Son and H. Ghoſt are one eſſence, and
each of theſe three is every where; yet that they may manifeſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of perſons, one having condeſcended to an incarnation whoſe
human nature there appeared, the other two did at his baptiſme manifeſt
themſelves by ſenſible ſymbols. Which three ſenſible manifeſtations
Almighty God was pleaſed then to make unto mens ſenſes in three diſtinct
places (though each of the three perſons be in all places) that we who
are in divers places might have ſome apprehenſion of the diſtinct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonalities.</p>
            <p>12. In your 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. §. you tell Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> of <hi>Luther, Calvin, Zuinglius</hi> (as the
Romaniſts are wont.) As if all thoſe who proteſt againſt the Church of
Rome for pretending to <hi>infallibilty,</hi> were thereupon neceſſarily obliged
to place the ſame infalibility in every Proteſtant Doctor. And whereas
you ought (if you would ſay any thing pertinently) to prove what the
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> anſwered, you tell us what the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
in <hi>other</hi> Nations object; whether truely or not I ſhall not now ſtand
to examine.</p>
            <p>13. But I am glad to meet with a man that hath read <hi>ALL the books of
Papists in thoſe times, and ALL their Hiſtories.</hi> I hope you would not cite
them <hi>all</hi> as <hi>fitted</hi> with matter for your purpoſe, unleſſe you had read them
<hi>all:</hi> I entreat you to cite not <hi>all</hi> of them (though the more the merrier)
but only one, if you can, in <hi>all</hi> your vaſt hiſtorical readings (I ſay one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
of thoſe many thouſands that have defended the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>)
who hath made ſuch an Enthuſiaſtical anſwer as that of <hi>G. W.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>14. In your 5th. §. you fondly imagine <hi>T. S.</hi> ſtark mute divers times;
<pb facs="tcp:167147:5"/>
As firſt, upon your ſaying that <hi>the first Proteſtant Biſhops had no ordination,
but what they mutually gave themſelves and one another. Anſ.</hi> If you mean by
<hi>mutually</hi> (as common ſenſe requires) that the <hi>Ordained</hi> did ordain the
<hi>Ordainer</hi> Biſhop, I beſeech you to prove it: for 'tis as falſe, as 'tis evidently
known that the four Biſhops-Ordeiners were Biſhops before the beginning
of Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reign; of which time onely you make this queſtion and
ſcruple.</p>
            <p>15. Secondly, you fancy <hi>T. S.</hi> mute again upon your asking who gave
them commiſſion to make <hi>Math. Parker</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> Anſ.
The Biſhops in King <hi>Edward</hi> VI's. time did give them power and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
(for all Biſhops have <hi>commiſſion</hi> when fit occaſion and due circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
occur) to make <hi>Mat. Parker</hi> Biſhop: and <hi>I</hi> doubt not but Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>
(as mute as you conceive him, and impertinent in Manuſcripts) is both
able and ready to ſhow you in his own private library (beſides what he
hath in the publick) ſome antient records, wherein you'l find it evident
that <hi>Mat. Parker</hi> was a true Biſhop; if you think there can any evidence
ariſe from the teſtimony of a peeviſh adverſary, who lived in <hi>Matthew Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
dayes.</p>
            <p>16. Preſently you add that <hi>T. S. dared not profeſs openly that they receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their commiſſion from Popiſh Biſhops of</hi> K. <hi>Henry VIII</hi>'s <hi>time. Anſ.</hi> true;
becauſe he dares not ſpeak a falſity: for they received it in the time of
<hi>Edw.</hi> VI. Though what you ſuppoſe had been no impoſſible thing, ſince
good Proteſtants in the dayes of <hi>Edw.</hi> VI. had received valid baptiſme
(as <hi>all</hi> men do acknowledg) in <hi>Henry</hi> the eights reign.</p>
            <p>17. In anſwer to the reſt of this §. be pleaſed to know that the antient
Church believed (contrary to your Popiſh novelty) that all Biſhops had
ſpiritual juriſdiction, as being ſucceſſors to the Apoſtles. And 'tis only
the intereſt of the Pope to deny it: who is wont to make <hi>titular</hi> Biſhops
<hi>without</hi> juriſdiction, to ſerve himſelf in his pretended Councils.</p>
            <p>18. I hope I need not tell Mr. <hi>D.</hi> (who tells others §. 15. how <hi>they
ſpeak at Cambridge</hi>) that a Maſter and a Family, an overſeer and a charge
are <hi>relata,</hi> riſe and fall together: but I muſt tell him that Biſhop <hi>Barlow</hi>
and <hi>Miles Coverdale</hi> had the warrant of all their Eccleſiaſtical Superiors
(who then were over them) to make Biſhops in the dioceſs of <hi>London</hi>
and that <hi>Bonner</hi> was not their ſuperior.</p>
            <p>19. To what you ſpeake at large of Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> being a Lay-perſon
and not being able to give any power, &amp;c. I anſwer; What power that
Queen had, and ought to have in Eccleſiaſtical matters you may ſee in
the <hi>Articles of the Church of England:</hi> which no Papiſt nor Anabaptiſt (H.
D. or W. J. W. J. or H. D.) was ever able to diſprove, or durſt ſay one
word againſt it.</p>
            <p>20. Reading forward I am at a ſtand, and muſt plainly confeſſe I know
not what you mean by what followes, <hi>viz.</hi> your comparing the common
people, and Maſters of Families with the <hi>Queen</hi> that then was. I know
<pb facs="tcp:167147:5"/>
not what your aſſerting <hi>that theſe have as much power as the Queen</hi> can
drive at, but caſting off all authority; like your brethren at <hi>Munſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>21. To your 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. §. I anſwer that if there be any Churches beyond
our ſeas, <hi>who count it their glory to want a ſucceſſion of Biſhops, yea to cry
ſhame upon it; and to reject it as a ſuperstitious relique of Popery, and mark of
Antichrist,</hi> we are no more engaged to defend ſuch people, then the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
is engaged to defend the Papiſt, or the Papiſt a Quaker; nor ſo much,
as appears by this Apology which I am now anſwering.</p>
            <p>22. This I know that not only the Reformed Churches in their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi>
of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> and again in their <hi>Apology</hi> for that Confeſſion (cap. <hi>de.
ordine eccleſiaſtico, &amp; cap. de poteſtate eccleſ.</hi>) and in their other colloquies
at <hi>Wormes</hi> and <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> and divers of their books beſide; but likewiſe
<hi>Mr. Calvin</hi> (who ſubſcribed the <hi>Augustane</hi> confeſſion) in his book <hi>de
neceſſitate reformandae eccleſiae</hi> to <hi>Cardinal Sadolet</hi> his old friend, and
in his <hi>epiſtles</hi> to Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Ridley,</hi> and in his <hi>Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions</hi>
l. 4. c. 4. §. 4. And with him Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> too in his book <hi>de diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
gradibus Miniſtr.</hi> c. 21. §. 23. I ſay <hi>I</hi> know (and am as ſure as a man that
believes his eyes can be) that theſe and <hi>Zanchy, Diodati, Cappellus, Pet.
Moulin; Daillé,</hi> and others the moſt learned French-men now living believe
epiſcopacy and the government by Biſhops to be <hi>lawfull</hi> at leaſt. And <hi>I</hi>
am ſure that Mr. T. <hi>S.</hi> if H. <hi>D.</hi> be ſo well acquainted with him as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
(but <hi>I</hi> am told he confeſſed he did not know him ſo much as by
ſight, the ſame hour that he owned this printed book to him) will at his
requeſt give him a larger liſt of reformed forraign Divines on this ſubject,
and proofes that other proteſtant churches beſide the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion
of Biſhops which I ſaw in his chamber. But there is ſo much already
printed of the L. Viſcount <hi>Falklands</hi> Bp. <hi>Carleton</hi> and others againſt your
ungrounded aſſertion, that I ſhall deferr ſending you a larger catalogue
until you (or your friend <hi>Knot</hi> the Jeſuit, who alſo hath writ againſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy)
ſhall have anſwered Dr. <hi>Hamonds diſſertations againſt Blondel,</hi>
otherwiſe than by your ſword and ſequeſtration.</p>
            <p>23. Your 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. §. conteining nothing to the purpoſe but a bare aſſertion
<hi>that [T. S.</hi> §. 16. <hi>and] great numbers even of Epiſcopall men, PRESBYTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIANS
Independents, and ALL profeſſors beſides Papists, do refuſe to take
the oath of abjuration,</hi> is in my opinion anſwered ſufficiently, till it be
proved, by a bare negation; Though ſome of them have much more cauſe
to refuſe it than you; who have taken away the former trial of Popery,
<hi>viz. Recuſancy;</hi> common by the Law to Papiſts, Anabaptiſts and other
Sectaries: which names I hope you'l not be angry at, while you take them
to your ſelf p. 16. l. 14. 16.</p>
            <p>24. In your 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. §. you argue againſt the oath thus; <hi>No man can ſafely
ſwear that he believes no purgatory, unleſſe he be as ſure that there is no purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
as that there is a God. Anſ.</hi> This looks like the ſaying of <hi>Fa. Knot</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Chillingworth,</hi> who thinks that what ever he believes in religion he
<pb facs="tcp:167147:6"/>
believes with the ſame certainty wherewith he receives the higheſt arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Chriſtian faith. When paſſion and prejudice is laid aſide, I
hope you'l find time to conſider whether if you were now diſputing in the
Divinity Schools you might not ſafely affirm that to be true which is
your <hi>opinion</hi> in any matter of Religion, and not expect that any Caviller
who ſtands by (and is no way concerned in the Act) ſhould thence inferr
and cry out <hi>that you are as ſure of it as that there is a God who made the world.</hi>
If this Caviller ſhould go further, ſingle this aſſertion (perhaps being
only <hi>argumentum ad hominem</hi>) out of your whole diſpute and <hi>print</hi> a book
againſt it, would not he be (as you ſay Mr. <hi>S.</hi> is) not a little ridiculous?
And would not you your ſelf take as little notice of him as Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>
doth of you? <hi>I</hi> ſhould enlarge upon this your acception of the word <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi>
but that Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> hath ſaid enough of it in his anſwer to
your Brother <hi>Knot,</hi> and <hi>T.</hi> S. in his defenſe of <hi>Chillingworth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>25. In the laſt lines of this 12th. page you have theſe words, <hi>what do</hi>
I <hi>know whether purgatory be revealed in Scripture or no?</hi> You ſeem here
plainly to profeſs that you do not know whether Papiſts or Proteſtants
be in the right, ſo far as to Gods revelation in Scripture; which <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi>
have alwayes made their <hi>rule.</hi> By which we may judge what a
Proteſtant you are, And that Anabaptiſts either deny the <hi>H.</hi> Scripture
to be their <hi>rule,</hi> or affirm that they know no error in purgatory.</p>
            <p>26. To the 9th. §. whereof I can ſcarce make common ſence, I might
tell you that no <hi>Parliament</hi> is in any ſenſe that which is ſignified by the
word perſon. But I rather anſwer that no Parliament can free any perſon
from any oath of beliefe which he hath taken: For example, if one
Parliament propound an oath to me to declare whether I think the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Councill of Trent be Orthodox and Catholick, and I ſwear
no; from this oath ten thouſand Parliaments can never abſolve me. If I
ſwear in truth I need no Abſolution: but if I therein forſwear my ſelf, the
Parliament can not free me from perjury, nor remit the guilt of it. The
matter of this oath was Concerning belief, and I never yet heard or read,
that any Parliament in <hi>England</hi> did aſſume power of ſetting men at
liberty from beleiving what they believe in matter of Religion. I grant
that an Act of Parliament may be repealed by a Parliament and ſo the
Law of exacting this oath may be abrogated, but that an oath taken
Concerning matter of belief or not belief can be voided by any Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
on earth, is the doctrine not of any Engliſh Parliament, but only of
the Conclave at <hi>Rome:</hi> therefore (good Mr. <hi>Denne</hi>) creep not under the
wing of an Engliſh Parliament, but confeſſe your Argument to be a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
weapon of a Romiſh Jeſuite.</p>
            <p>27. To your 10th. §. I anſwer briefly, that 'tis not to be imagined any
Engliſh Parliament hath or will forbid the ſubject of any Prince to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
that <hi>civill</hi> ſubjection which is due to his Soveraign, ſo long
as he remaines in his dominions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:167147:6"/>
28. In your 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Sections you make the oath of abjuration to
be both a prelaticall and Presbyterian deſign (<hi>prelaticall</hi> men muſt be
ſure to pay for all) but whereas you tell me divers times of <hi>Prelatical
malice,</hi> and <hi>that the Papiſts <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally diſown that Tenet which is objected to
them as theirs; viz. That faith is not to be kept with Hereticks.</hi> I ſhall not inſiſt
upon the Lateran councel (which decreed <hi>anno. 1216. can.</hi> 30. that the
Pope hath power to abſolve ſubjects from their obedience) which is one of
thoſe Synods to which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith all that are Catholicks muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit:
but I reply, that what you ſay here is nothing to the purpoſe, for Mr. <hi>S.</hi>
never ſaid otherwiſe, for (in the 16th. page of his <hi>preface to Daille's Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
for the Reformed Churches</hi>) he profeſſeth ſo much kindneſs to the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt
in this particular, that I have heard him cenſured by ſome of them
as talking there like an <hi>inamorato.</hi> But methinks both they and you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of cenſuring him and bringing <hi>new</hi> arguments, ſhould anſwer that
which he printed therein above ſix years ſince; eſpecially when he there
doth <hi>very earnestly beſeech</hi> them to anſwer it, profeſſing that he had been
many years <hi>troubled</hi> with it. The argument is this, That which one or
two (or ſome few) Roman Doctors ſay is lawfull, may (in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Papiſts) be done without danger of mortal ſin [the <hi>Major</hi> is Mr.
<hi>Knots charity maintained</hi> c. 4. §. 25. as alſo <hi>Valentia, Vaſquez, Leſſius, Enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques,

many Roman Doctors ſay, 'tis lawfull to murder or depoſe a ſupreme
Magiſtrate that is guilty of hereſie or ſuſpected of it. <hi>Cavete principes
concluſionem.</hi> The minor is ſufficiently proved by Dr. <hi>Jer. Taylors</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
on the powder treaſon p. 50. and 51. and in a ſmall tract intituled
<hi>Romiſh poſitions for rebellion</hi> collected by Bp. <hi>Morton:</hi> and <hi>Mr. Yaxley</hi>'s
reaſons why he could not be a <hi>Romaniſt</hi> (as he much deſired) and a <hi>good
ſubject</hi> to his Soveraign at one time.</p>
            <p>29. <hi>Reading 'tother day</hi> Sleidans <hi>relation of your friends affairs at
Munſter I met with this paſſage, that there was</hi> a law made at the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of Conſtance that promiſe ſhould not be kept with Hereticks, or thoſe that
be ſuſpected for Hereticks, though they came to the Synod upon the publick faith
of the Emperour for the hearing of their cauſe. Sleidan, l. 3. ad an. 1521, mihi

of the church of Rome; which in good earnest I think they will never be
able to anſwer, upon their own principles. Anſ.</hi> Obſerve how this man
(though he called himſelf Anabaptiſt and Sectary but two or three lines
before theſe words) now ſoon forgets what perſon he had aſſumed, pulls
off his Vizard, and appears a <hi>bare faced</hi> Romaniſt. Obſerve how he who
profeſſes to teach men to be diſobedient and rebellious to all Biſhops, paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately
and haſtily takes part with him, who hath uſurped upon
all Biſhops in the Chriſtian world: and rather then looſe his deſign, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
all who now profeſſe not to obey the Church of Rome Rebells, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient,
and Apoſtates from Her Government (ſure he can not in good
earneſt ſuppoſe them to be diſobedient, unleſs in good earneſt he believe
they owe her obedience.) Then judge what a foul ſlander this is in Mr.
D. to blame proteſtants for their not endeavouring to anſwer thoſe things
which have been anſwered an hundred times by Biſhops unanſwerably:
Judge what a crime it is for one who calls himſelf a Proteſtant to object
<pb facs="tcp:167147:7"/>
againſt this and all other reformed Churches, the moſt bitter calumnies
that the moſt extream rigid peeviſh Papiſts have deviſed.</p>
            <p>34. You goe on thus; <hi>ſuppoſing their ordination for which they ſo much
contend to be of neceſſity and of Divine right, and that they had it from the
Church of Rome, as moſt certainly they had.</hi> Anſ. Here you ſeem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
what you ſaid in the 6th. §. (p. 9. l. 33.) in theſe words, <hi>nor
could he in truth affirm it.</hi> But if you mean by theſe words laſt cited out
of the 12th. §. (as they ſeem to import) that you eſteem our ordination
to be of divine right becauſe it came in ſucceſſion from the Church of
Rome, 'tis a wide miſtake. In ſumm, methinks you declare here openly in
this paragraph that <hi>all who are baptized and ordained by any of the Church of
Rome</hi> (as 'tis certain a great part of this nation was, even in the time
of <hi>Gregorius M.) do therefore now and ſhall for all future ages owe obedience
to the Pope of Rome; or elſe they are all Rebells and Apoſtates.</hi> Whereas we
are not <hi>more</hi> ordained by thoſe who were ordained by others from the
Church of Rome, then Mr. <hi>Denne</hi> himſelf was baptized by the hand of
one of thoſe who was baptized from others that were heretofore Romiſh
Prieſts; ſo that our Ordination is ſurely as divine as his baptiſme. As
for his being <hi>rebaptized,</hi> both the Church of Rome (for whom he pleads)

               <head>The Anſwer is this.</head>
               <p>36. The popes of the Church of Rome dare not deny themſelves to
have received Ordination from the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this they profeſſe that they owe no ſubjection to the Biſhop of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem:</hi>
Therefore it was (not prelaticall, but) <hi>Anabaptiſtical</hi> I malice to
tell all Biſhops that have been ordained from Rome they are Apoſtates and
Rebels from the Church of Rome <hi>in good earneſt</hi> if they (avouching or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
from the Clergy to be of neceſſity and Divine right) do not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
the Pope.</p>
               <p>37. That which followes in your books about Mr. <hi>G.</hi> &amp; Mr. <hi>P.</hi> who diſputed
againſt the Romaniſts (a fact which I believe Mr. <hi>Hen. Denne</hi> never was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
will be guilty of) all that know thoſe Miniſters know to be ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and frivolous. However <hi>I</hi> to whom you (in defenſe of the Quakers
very pertinently do object this) think fit to tell you, that whereas the
Romaniſt took a longer time only to put forth an edition of that, which
if he had dealt truely was all before done to his hand; whereas he hath
alſo ſo changed, tranſpoſed, added, diminiſh't and made of it what he
<pb facs="tcp:167147:8"/>
liſt, that <hi>I</hi> believe it will be as ſoon owned for your (I mean not J. S. but
<hi>H. D's.</hi>) conference as Mr. <hi>Pearſons</hi> or Mr. <hi>Gunnings;</hi> I muſt now tell you
further (what you have been oft enough told) that that relation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
expect to be regarded by Mr. <hi>P.</hi> or any ſober perſon which is diſclam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and diſowned by three of the four who were diſputants, <hi>viz.</hi> by both
the Proteſtants and half the Papiſts.</p>
               <p>38. But chiefly I muſt entreat you to conſider whether the inſerting of
above 200. lines at a time as part of the conference which never was part
of it (beſides all profeſſed additions) 2ly. Whether the leaving out whole
ſheets of the Proteſtants, which the Papiſts thought too hard to anſwer;
and 3ly. the ſcarce ſuffering any one argument and anſwer of both to
come together (but caſting uſually parts of the ſame paper of Mr. <hi>G.</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſcore leaves aſunder one from the other) be not a ſcandal that any
Chriſtian would deſire might be covered with ſilence. And I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know from any ingenuous perſon, whether this might not be anſwer
enough to a book put out at the charge of the Romaniſts <hi>own</hi> purſe and
conſcience; a diſcourſe by being mangled rendred ſo unintelligible, that
ſcarce any man ever read it over or will.</p>
               <p>39. One of your friends ſent 3 copies of this conference between Mr.
<hi>G.</hi> Mr. P. and the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> to Mr. <hi>T. S.</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who being very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to hear what was in it (and having not leaſure to read it all him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf)
gave two of them away, upon condition that thoſe learned perſons
on whom he beſtowed them ſhould read it: but they both threw it aſide
before they had read a few leaves of it. Reverend <hi>Mr. Will. Moor,</hi> the
deceaſed Library keeper, was perſwaded by <hi>Mr. T. S.</hi> to read one leaf; but
profeſſed before many witneſſes he would not read another if you would
give him the whole impreſſion: becauſe 'twas ſo unintellegible for the cauſes
above mentioned.</p>
               <p>40. As for your own book (which you commend) againſt the ſame Mr. <hi>G.</hi> of
the ſame alloy. If a tract as full of falſhood as any pamphlet is wont to
be fraught with, may be believed againſt ſo many thouſand witneſſes as
heard you both diſpute two dayes; &amp; at length the diſpute, interrupted by
the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> themſelves againſt all laws of diſpute, as you your ſelf then
&amp; there <hi>acknowledged;</hi> If Mr. <hi>Gunnings</hi> giving the world ſatisfaction at the
ſame place concerning the whole matter and the Univerſall Churches
tradition concerning that queſtion, in a third diſcourſe afterward, at
the requeſt of the Moderator (For the Moderator hearing both Mr. <hi>D.</hi> and
Mr. <hi>G.</hi> appeal to the Churches tradition, ſaid, that <hi>the Auditory was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied
in that particular, and therefore deſired that one of them would take
the pains to clear it,</hi> Mr. <hi>Denne</hi> refuſing Mr. <hi>G.</hi> did it) to which Mr. <hi>Denne</hi>
then durſt not reply a word. If I ſay all this cannot reſcue Mr. <hi>G.</hi> from the
expectation of a reply to a pamphlet in print, <hi>becauſe forſooth 'tis in print,</hi>
we may expect his anſwer hereafter when he ſhall ſee fit; with a relation
of a former and of a later Jeſuites dealing and Mr. <hi>Dennes</hi> collated.</p>
               <p>41. But in the mean while to give you and your friends employment
<pb facs="tcp:167147:8"/>
(which I perceive you want) and ſatisfaction if poſſible; After you have
anſwered the letter <hi>in Quaker Diſarm'd</hi> (taking in the encloſed printed
paper entituled <hi>a Gag for lay-preachers</hi> which you may have neer the Little
North-door of S. <hi>Pauls,</hi>) I ſhall entreat you to know (becauſe you complain
of your <hi>books lying unanſwered, and therein a ſcandall and prejudice to the
Protestant cauſe</hi>) that there is a multitude of conſiderable books writ by
Proteſtants in <hi>folio</hi> and other volumes againſt the Church of Rome which
have been 20. or 30. years unanſwered; and are like to lye forty
more.</p>
               <p>42. I ſhall name ſome: firſt (for your reading) <hi>a new gag for an old gooſe</hi> by
Biſhop <hi>Mountague,</hi> Bp. <hi>Franc. White,</hi> and Bp. <hi>Laud,</hi> and Bp. <hi>Chappell</hi> againſt
<hi>Fiſher, Spalato</hi>'s 3. tomes, Bp. <hi>Hall, Birckbeck, Crackenthorp,</hi> Bp. <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi>
againſt <hi>Bullinger,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tho. Jackson, Chillingworth,</hi> (tho your friends
the Jeſuites have attempted to anſwer his pamphlet, as they call it, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
times, and Mr. <hi>Knot</hi> was 19. or 20. years about one.) Then in a
ſmaller volume ſo many that a bare catalogue of them would make a big
book, as Dr. <hi>Coſins,</hi> Dr. <hi>Jer. Taylor,</hi> Dr. <hi>Fern,</hi> Dr. <hi>Featly,</hi> Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> of infallibility, and his <hi>diſpatcher diſpacht.</hi> Theſe all <hi>new,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<hi>old</hi> ones. Not to mention the heaps of excellent pieces of Forrainers
<hi>Dailleus, Moulin, Blondell, Calixtus, Bochartus, Placeus,</hi> &amp;c. each of them
as famous and conſiderable as your Jeſuites.</p>
               <p>43. And yet you and they be the men that clamour againſt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
as if they could ſay <hi>nothing</hi> for themſelves, when 'tis as clear as the
ſun at noon, that neither you in this apology nor they in their other
writings have a word to alledg againſt us, but what hath been unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
refelled by the forementioned Authors and others 100. times. And
yet you are ſo wiſe as to complain of <hi>our</hi> ſilence, and the Jeſuites (for
whom you here plead) put forth books conſiſting only of queſtions to the
ſame men, inſteed of giving them ſo much as one anſwer to their <hi>many</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations
made againſt you: and though ſome of them as Mr. <hi>G. Dr.
H.</hi> &amp;c. never declined any meeting with the ableſt of you and the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites,
but attend the buſineſs as diligently as if they had nothing elſe to do,
and have been oft declined by you and them, and can bring witneſſes to
depoſe where ſeverall Romiſh Prieſts have appointed dayes and houres
and (at the very hour appointed) ſent a flam to prevent the meeting.</p>
               <p>44. But to come cloſer to you Mr. <hi>Denne.</hi> For your part, beſides this
ſcandalous falſe printed relation of your own here mentioned, one may
(to uſe your own words) gueſſe at the <hi>conſcience and honesty</hi> of Mr. <hi>Hen.
Denne</hi> by his ſaying not one word in his book of a publick conference
held by him and the ſame perſon, upon the ſame queſtion, at <hi>Caſtor</hi> in
<hi>Northamptonſhire.</hi> But I ſuppoſe you'l publiſh that when you print your
publick diſpute with Mr. <hi>Weller</hi> of <hi>Immanuel</hi> Colledge before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
at the <hi>Bear</hi> in <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>45. Beſides all this, a reaſonable man would think that Mr. <hi>Gunning</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:167147:9"/>
having taken ſuch paines, when you diſputed with him at S. <hi>Clements Church,</hi>
to keep the Auditors from hiſſing Mr. <hi>Hen. Denne</hi> quite off from the desk
and diſpute (as divers who were there tell me they will witneſſe) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
to be excuſed if he takes no paines to conſider your pamphleting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
               <p>46. The mentioning whereof minds me of your blaming Mr. <hi>T. S.</hi> for
Arabick, &amp;c. In anſwer to which I am told, that though he ownes the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
as a true matter of fact, and ſo far <hi>his;</hi> yet 'twas penned by one of
the auditors who took it in ſhort-hand: and then it was no abſurdity to
ſay Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> was doing that which all the Univerſity knowes he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by the <hi>Vice-chancellour</hi> to do, in reference to printing a <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi>
of all the Manuſcripts in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> which is now ready for the Preſs.
But ſuppoſe all this to be falſe, yet it will be hard if Mr. <hi>T. S.</hi> who was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
by Mr. <hi>Wheelock</hi> when he left <hi>Cambridge</hi> without hope of returning
(under hand and ſeal) <hi>Arabick</hi> profeſſour and hath taught that language
to divers, have not more skill in that tongue then you have in the <hi>Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opick</hi>
who cannot read it, and yet cited <hi>that</hi> and all other tranſlations of
the N. T. in the publick conference that you boaſt of at St. <hi>Clements</hi>
Church without Temple-Bar: ſaying you would ſtick to the <hi>AETHIOPIC.</hi>
And your reſpondent asking you whether you brought your argument
from the <hi>Aethiopic copy</hi> or the Latin <hi>verſion?</hi> You replyed with ſome ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<hi>from both, from both, Sir.</hi> Which paſſage (together with your ſaying
that <hi>Children cry becauſe they are unwilling to be baptized though they neither
will nor nill,</hi> with divers others (which you are ſo faithful a relater as to paſs
over in ſilence) having made thoſe thouſands of people which heard you
very merry, might have remained buried in ſilence, if looking into
your two Books I had not met with your <hi>Aethiopic</hi> as well as <hi>Arabick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>47. But now leaving your languages I returne to your Apology, where
§. 13. you ſay <hi>you can not ſee any great reaſon of fear or danger from the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi>
queſtionleſſe your bare warrant ſhall ſecure all Engliſh men from
Powder-plots hereafter.</p>
               <p>48. Your 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> §. you thus begin in their defence, <hi>I am to ſay ſomething
concerning thoſe common Brutes which are raiſed againſt Popiſh Priests and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites,
as if they did ſecretly inſinuate themſelves into the Congregations of
different profeſſions in Religion.</hi> To which I anſwer that Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and the reſt whom you call Bedlams p. 6. &amp; 19. may cry you mercy
for the report of <hi>ſecret inſinuations,</hi> for me thinks 'tis <hi>open</hi> enough now;
or let the World judge by this book of yours.</p>
               <p>49. But let us hear what he reports theſe bedlams and bookmakers
to ſay (by the way did H. D. never furniſh the tobacco-ſhop with waſt
paper They tell (quoth H. D.) of an idle fellow one <hi>Ramſey,</hi> &amp;c.
I wiſh Mr. <hi>Hen. Den</hi> were ſuch an <hi>Idle</hi> fellow, that he be likely to have the
tithe of his Scholarſhip, though he live as long again. What this Mr.
<hi>Ramſey</hi> is and was, I deſire Mr. <hi>Denne</hi> may learn from a book printed by
<pb facs="tcp:167147:9"/>
ſome of very good repute in Newcaſtle, and the depoſitions ſent up by the
Mayor of that Town with Mr. <hi>Ramſey</hi> to <hi>London;</hi> ſome years before Mr.
<hi>Prynne</hi> could hear any thing of his conference at <hi>Cambridge:</hi> ſo that he
was not impriſoned upon a bare ſuſpicion as Mr. D. ſaith. How he got
out of the <hi>Gatehouſe,</hi> and what he did in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> I had rather he ſhould
hear from Mr. <hi>Ratcliff</hi> and Mr. <hi>Griffith</hi> of Chriſts Colledge, divers of St.
<hi>Johns</hi> and other Colledges (whom he taught Hebrew) than from me; who
am confident I know his Religion &amp; deſign from other Reaſons, beſides his
frequenting <hi>Milton</hi> neer <hi>Cambridge.</hi> But ſure <hi>H. D</hi>'s concluding that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Ramſey</hi> came not to further tryal, therefore he was no diſguiſed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,
is no better an argument, than if he ſhould prove, that there have
been no Jeſuits in <hi>England</hi> of late years, becauſe (though divers have
been apprehended) none have been brought to Tryal.</p>
               <p>50. Concerning the Franciſcan at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> the oath of <hi>G. Cowliſhaw</hi>
Ironmonger in <hi>Briſtol</hi> is upon record, and printed in Mr. <hi>Pryns Quaker un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maskt,</hi>
edit. 2. p. 3. who (p. 34, &amp;c.) anſwers to what H. D. here objects
to clear the Franciſcan. Beſides him at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> I could tell Mr. <hi>Denne</hi> a
ſtrange ſtory of his Father <hi>Whitebread</hi> ſaying Maſs about <hi>London;</hi> and of
another diſputing for the Quakers, and preſently proved a masked Papiſt
at <hi>Wolverhampton:</hi> but I had rather he ſhould have theſe things from
others who have more leiſure. When he ſhall have conſidered theſe and
other like relations (which will ſhortly be printed at large) I will deſire
him to tell the world, whether they be <hi>groundleſs and unproved calumnies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>51. To the next words, wherein he ſayes, No mans innocency will be
able to protect him againſt ſuſpition; I anſwer, That it is not fit any man
ſhould judge, how hardly Mr. <hi>Denne</hi> ſhall be dealt with by any <hi>ſuſpitions,</hi>
further then may appear by thoſe propoſitions of his, which are recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the cloſe of this addreſs.</p>
               <p>52. In the very next line <hi>H. D.</hi> ſaith, that <hi>he for his part does very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
aſſure himſelf, that if an oath were tendred to ALL the Papiſts in this
Nation, they would willingly ſwear, that neither they themſelves, nor any that
they know, did ever uſe any ſuch practiſe, or ever thought it lawful to diſſemble
their Religion.</hi> Wherein <hi>H. D.</hi> expreſſes queſtionleſſe a greater confidence
in behalf of the Jeſuits, then either <hi>Clark</hi> or <hi>Watſon</hi> would of <hi>Robert
Parſons</hi> the Jeſuite; or the ſecular Prieſts at this day will for the body of
that Society, as appears by their books which for theſe ſixty years they
have writ one againſt another. So that <hi>H. D.</hi> is a cloſer friend to the
Jeſuites then many Romiſh Prieſts be.</p>
               <p>53. This 15th. §. begins thus, <hi>we all know 'tis a fallacious way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to proceed, a poſſe ad eſſe, as they ſpeak at Cambridge</hi> (Do not they
ſpeak ſo at <hi>Doway</hi> and St. <hi>Omers</hi> too?) <hi>and yet no better is the Argument of
the Papiſt's Adverſaries in this caſe.</hi> Here he blames ſome perſons under
the name of Popiſh Adverſaries, ſure he means to exempt himſelf from the
number. And before he is gone to the middle of this page he falls again
<pb facs="tcp:167147:10"/>
to undertaking for the Principles of Popery, and paſſes his word that
their principles contain nothing which allowes diſſimulation in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>54. But in the laſt page he will needs have Mr. <hi>S.</hi> to be a Papiſt for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting
<hi>that we receive the Canon of Scripture upon the Authority of the
Church of all Ages, and the pure ſpouſe of Christ,</hi> I would fain be told by
Mr. <hi>Denne</hi> what reaſon he can give to his brethren Anabaptiſts and the
Quakers, why the ſong of <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhould be Canon and other uſefull
books which bare <hi>his</hi> name Apocrypha, why the Revelation of St. <hi>John</hi>
ſhould be put into the Canon 300. years after Chriſt and ſome goſpells
(bearing the Apoſtles names) left out, but the authority of the Jewiſh
Church for the Old, and of the Chriſtian for the New Teſtament? But
I would have him remember that to talk of the pure ſpouſe of Chriſt, and
the Church of all ages, and exclude the 12. Apoſtles and the firſt Century
out of it, is a diſcourſe not becoming Mr. <hi>Dennes</hi> profeſſion.</p>
               <p>55. Sure <hi>H. D.</hi> never ſaw Dr. <hi>Coſin</hi> of the <hi>Canon of Scripture,</hi> nor <hi>Hooker's</hi>
Eccleſiaſtical policy, nor heard of <hi>St. Auguſtines non Crederem Scripturis
niſi me moveret Eccleſtae authoritas.</hi> If Mr. <hi>S.</hi> be a Papiſt for this, he hath
theſe and a multitude of ſuch good Proteſtant-company <hi>Popiſh</hi> with
him.</p>
               <p>56. You ask <hi>what other Church was there in all ages, but the Roman?</hi> I
anſwer, unleſs you and I agree now upon the terms of the queſtion we
muſt <hi>end</hi> where we ſhould have <hi>begun;</hi> therefore firſt I muſt deſire you to
tell me what you mean by the <hi>Roman Church?</hi> Which I ſhall ſcarce
know, till you anſwer the 20. queſtions that Mr. <hi>T. S.</hi> puts in the cloſe
of his preface to <hi>Daille's</hi> apology. But that you may not paſs without
<hi>one</hi> anſwer, I pray tell me what other Church was there in all ages
but the Greek Church, and thoſe that agree with her in all or moſt
part of what ſhe holds, particularly in believing no infallibility or Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
jurisdiction (over all) in the Biſhop of Rome, for which among
other good doctrines the preſent Roman Church refuſeth her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?</p>
               <p>57. And here you mend all at laſt; for you no ſooner hear talk of a
<hi>pure</hi> ſpouſe of Chriſt the Church <hi>of</hi> all ages, but you apprehend it can be
underſtood of none but the Roman Church; and ſay plainly, that to talk
of a pure ſpouſe of Chriſt and the Catholick church in the creed, the
church of all ages (for thoſe are the words in the letter that you cite) is
doubtleſs in effect, to juſtifie the church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a pure church.</p>
               <p>58. Thus having examined Mr. <hi>Hen. Dennes</hi> new book and Religion,
I ſhall only recollect a few poſitions publiſht by him and his friend <hi>George
Whitehead</hi> the Quaker (whom he would prove to be no Papiſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that <hi>no Papiſt is a Quaker</hi>) and then leave <hi>Mr.</hi> D. to turn over his
<hi>Aethiopick</hi> Teſtament, <hi>all</hi> the books of Papiſts, and <hi>ALL</hi> their hiſtories;
and leave the Reader to judge how good Proteſtants this fit couple be;
<pb facs="tcp:167147:10"/>
                  <hi>H. D.</hi> and <hi>G. W. George Whitehead</hi> beſides thoſe particulars which are
mentioned in the Queries hereto annexed (eſpecially p. 14. and 16.)
maintaines theſe ſeven following Romiſh doctrines: 1. <hi>That justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is by inherent righteouſneſs:</hi> and ſo ſaith no Proteſtant but ſo ſaith
<hi>Bellarmin l. 2. de juſtificat. c.</hi> 3. 2ly. <hi>That a man may perfectly keep the
law without ſin:</hi> ſo ſaith (not <hi>Proteſtants</hi> but) <hi>Bell: l. 4. de juſtif. c.</hi> 11. 12. 13.
14. 3ly. <hi>G. W. denies the imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt for justification:</hi>
ſo <hi>Bell: l. 2. de juſtif. c.</hi> 7. 4ly. <hi>G. W.</hi> affirms that <hi>Scripture is not the
ſupream rule for trial of ſpirits:</hi> ſo <hi>Bell: l. 3. de verbo Dei c.</hi> 4. 5ly. <hi>G.
W.</hi> hath writ an whole book againſt Mr. <hi>Clapham</hi> to prove that the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
word is but a dead letter, and carnal. So ſaith <hi>Coſterus in enchyridio. p.</hi> 44.
6ly. <hi>G. W.</hi> pretends to <hi>immediate Revelations and pretended miracles</hi> (ſee
<hi>Clapham</hi> and the century of queries) ſo do the Papiſts: unchurching them
who pretend not to them as triall of a Church. 7ly. <hi>G. W.</hi> and the
Papiſt both alike <hi>place much of their holineſs in their beggarly apparrell, in
going openly with ſackcloath and barefooted,</hi> which I find taxed by the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Fathers of the Church. Thus far <hi>G. W.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>59. Now, for Mr. <hi>Hen. Denne;</hi> I hope the Reader hath ere this obſerved,
that though this book of his before us be entituled for the <hi>Quakers,</hi> &amp; (as
I am told) was offered to them at the Bull and Mouth in <hi>Aldersgate-ſtreet</hi>
for <hi>their</hi> preſs, yet it is indeed <hi>all</hi> in behalf of the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and conteins
not one word (from the firſt to the laſt) to the advantage of any ſect
under heaven but only the Romiſh: That the very ſame arguments, and
the very ſame expreſſions are uſed now againſt the Church of <hi>England</hi> by
the Anabaptiſt and by the Papiſt, ſo that he who anſwers one of them
anſwers both. I might take notice alſo of ſuch <hi>words</hi> in this <hi>Quaker no
Papiſt,</hi> as cauſe the Author thereof whoever he be (H. D. or J. W. or
W. J. for I take them to be <hi>all</hi> one man) to ſmell of a forrein Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey:
as when he ſpeakes of the <hi>Justice of peace in his District, p.</hi> 10. and
calls the ſame man <hi>Batchelour of Divinity and Master of Arts,</hi> putting this
after that, and the like: but to let this paſs I ſhall only mention a few of
Mr. <hi>Hen. Dennes</hi> poſitions delivered by him in this tract (for I have not
leaſure to look into <hi>Mr.</hi> Robothams <hi>Den of theeves</hi>) and then leave our
Diſputant and Scholar to read his <hi>Aethiopic</hi> books. Some of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
printed in this book entituled <hi>Quaker no Papiſt,</hi> are theſe,</p>
               <p>60. 1. That Mr. <hi>H. D.</hi> does not know whether Purgatory be revealed
in Scripture or not. <hi>p. 12. l. penult.</hi> 2. That 'tis clear who ever takes
the oath of abjuration doth forſwear the priviledges of Parliament. <hi>p.</hi> 14.
<hi>medio.</hi> 3. That <hi>in good earneſt</hi> he thinks thoſe who had their ordination
from the Church of Rome and do not obey the Pope, are <hi>Rebells, diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
