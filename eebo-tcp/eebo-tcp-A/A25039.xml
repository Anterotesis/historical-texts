            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>YEſterday Morning His Majeſty received the News of the entire defeat of the Rebels; of which we have the following account.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>ON <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning the Earl of <hi>Feverſham</hi> marched from <hi>Somerton</hi> to <hi>Weſton,</hi> within three Miles of <hi>Bridgwater.</hi> He Quartered his Horſe and Dragoons in the ſaid Village, and Encamped his Foot in an advantageous Poſt near it, fronting towards a Moor, (being a ſpacious Plain,) and having a Ditch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. In the Evening he had notice that the Rebels were draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Town, which made him keep his Troops in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſend out frequent parties to obſerve them. The Rebels ſo ordered their March, and with ſo great ſilence, that they found a quiet paſſage into the ſaid Moor; and there towards Morning form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Foot in Battle, to the number of between 5 and 6000. the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> being at the head of them, and marched near to our Camp: My Lord <hi>Feverſham</hi> having notice of it, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly put His Majeſties Forees, being about 2000 Foot, and 700. Horſe, Granadiers and Dragoons, into a poſture to receive them. The Rebels began with a great Volley of Shot and Shouts, which was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Ours in the ſame manner. In the mean time the Rebels were bringing their Horſe to ſecond their Foot, but were hindred by a Party of Horſe Commanded by Colonel <hi>Oglethorpe,</hi> who engaged them till my Lord of <hi>Oxford</hi>'s Regiment and the Detachements of the Guards came in to form the Line. The Reſiſtance of the Rebels Horse, which were between 1000 and 1200 Commanded by the late Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> was very inconſiderable, being never drawn up in a Body, but giving way before all that charged them, and ſoon after quitting the Field. All this while the Foot ſtood very firm on both ſides, and exchanged great Volleys, the Ditch beforementioned hindring them from cloſing; But our Cannon coming up, and our Horſe breaking in upon them, they were at laſt entirely routed, and three pieces of Cannon, all they had there, taken; About 2000 of them were killed, and many taken Priſoners: The moſt remarkable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe are Colonel <hi>Holms,</hi> and <hi>Perrot</hi> his Major, the Conſtable of <hi>Crookhorn,</hi> and <hi>Williams</hi> Servant to the late Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi> who had about him 200 Guineas, all the Monvs he ſays the ſaid late Duke had left; the Coat which he uſually wore was likewiſe taken.</p>

                  <!-- PDF PAGE 14 -->
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Feverſham,</hi> His Majeſties Lievtenant-General, was du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Action every where preſent, giving the neceſſary Orders with great Readineſs and Conduct: My Lord <hi>Churchil,</hi> who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded next under him, likewiſe performed his part with all the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Gallantry imaginable. The Duke of <hi>Graſton,</hi> and all the Commanders of Batallions and other Officers, behaved themſelves with great Reſolution and Bravery.</p>
                  <p>Of His Majeſties Forces there were about 300 killed and divers wounded, of whom a farther account will be given in a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Relation that will be publiſhed of this Action.</p>
                  <p>After the Field was cleared of the Rebels, the Earl of <hi>Feverſham</hi> marched with 500 Foot, and ſome Horſe and Dragoons to <hi>Bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water,</hi> the Rebels that were left there having fled and diſperſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſeveral places. His Lordſhip left theſe men in the Town, under the Command of Colonel <hi>Kirk;</hi> and hearing that the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was fled with about 50 Horſe, the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Rebels that were left together, he ſent out ſeveral Parties in Purſuit of him.</p>
                  <p>My Lord <hi>Feverſham</hi> intended to match yeſterday with His Majeſties Forces to <hi>Wells,</hi> and this day to <hi>Bath.</hi>
