            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

kinde, yet though I am innocent, I am not clear till abſolved by your mouth; My Lord, I was happy once (and rejoyced in being ſo) for ſome little reputation which your own goodnes had given me with you, for I had nothing in my ſelf to deſerve it: But if I have nothing in my ſelf to forfeit it neither, I beſeech your Lordſhip that I may preſerve it ſtill, that it may preſerve me ſtill; Your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe has ſeldom denied me in my interceſſions for others, I hope I ſhall not be only unhappy when I plead for my ſelf; I doubt not but divers have taken the advantage of my abſence as well as of my actions, to leſſen your eſteem of me: and 'tis not only that one thing of the Caſe of Tranſplantation, I hear they have miſrepreſented me in; I dare ſay it is miſrepreſentation, if any thing therein has diſpleaſed your Lordſhip, who can be no more offended with any thing that's juſt, then they can be pleas'd with any thing then what's otherwiſe: My Lord, it is your favour I crave, not theirs; before you to appear blameleſſe, not them, which I ſhall never do whileſt I oppoſe their intereſt and deſires of Arbitrary Power, which I eſteem my ſelf bound in duty to do, whileſt I have either power or intereſt, ſo far as it ſhall ſeem to me to oppoſe the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths good.

            <head>A Juſt VINDICATION of the AUTHOR and CASE of TRANSPLANTATION, from the unjuſt Aſperſions and Cenſures of <hi>RICHARD LA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RENCE.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hilſt any thing of Reputation might have been the effect of writing the Caſe of Tranſplanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I was content to take the labour to my ſelf, and leave the good to others: This was the reaſon of ſilencing my Name at firſt; and indeed the thing it ſelf had never invaded the Preſs, if a diffidence of my own Judgement had not made me willing to expoſe it to better, and the requeſt of ſome of the members of the Parliament that it might be throughly peruſed by them all. But now what I intended for good, is come to be thought ſo ill, I muſt leave that reſolution, and aſſert my own act to try if I can aſſert my innocence: yet I could have wiſht that he who undertook to confute me had uſed more of Reaſon and leſs of Paſſion; it being unlikely that ſhould make me ſee, which it ſelf had firſt blinded him.</p>
            <p>But though I did not think fit then to put my Name in Print, yet did not that Trifle ſteal out in ſo clandeſtine a way, as that the Parent was hid from all: but being laid at my door, I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116738:4"/>
owned it (when challenged) and the rumour ſpread like a train, ſo that I beleeve even Col. <hi>Laurence</hi> had a jealouſie, if not certainty who Writ it; which I am the more confirmd in by <hi>p. 17. line</hi> 10. of his book. The more I wonder, how not having (that I know) any perſonall ſpleen againſt me, or (I hope) not being lead by ſuch things, if he hath, he ſhould fall into ſuch foul defamations of me, as to go about to perſwade others ſuch things to be true of me, as he himſelf muſt believe moſt of them to be falſe: As that I am an abettor of the Iriſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, a Malignant, an incendiary, an oppoſer of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to which I ſhall ſay little now, becauſe they were fixt on a <hi>chimera</hi> before (my Name being concealed.) But hereafter, if he ſhall think fit to continue that wrong, the way will be more open to do my ſelf right: Surely from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer actings of my life he could not have charged me with all this guilt; and if in this laſt I happened to tread awry (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was not ſo ſharp ſighted as he) my ignorance ought rather to have been pitied, then my maliciouſneſs cenſured; I am not the firſt that hath done ill (once) if I had done ſo, and firſt faults do not uſe to be ſo rigidly treated, eſpecially by friends. I am not offended with Col. <hi>Laurence</hi> becauſe he is not of my minde, why ſhould he be that I was not of his? The unhappineſs is great enough that I was not ſo, he might have ſpared the attending ſeverities.</p>
            <p>I believe there is no perſon but would think it eaſie for me to make him loſe that pleaſure in ill hearing, that he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in ill ſpeaking: But I am both a Chriſtian to pardon, and a man not to ſcold; my aim is at truth, not victory; to have the beſt, not the laſt word; and this reſolution will ſhrink what of his Book is fit afterward to be anſwered, into a very little room, the carkaſs being but ſmall, when the guts and garbadge are thrown away: My civility obligeth me to wait upon him in the way, but not to tumble with him into the kennell.</p>
            <p>The firſt piece of juſtice that I owe to my ſelf, is to wipe off an aſperſion caſt on me by the Prologue, that uſhered Col. <hi>Laurence</hi> Book on the Stage; which though I ſhall not at random make him the Author of, I may prove my ſelf not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:116738:4"/>
to have deſerved. And this is no ill place for it now I am at the Bar, to anſwer (if I can) altogether.</p>
            <p>Letters in the Diurnall come from <hi>Ireland,</hi> which tell us, That there are certain ſummes of Money raiſing for Iriſh Agents in <hi>England,</hi> among whom the Author of <hi>the Caſe of Tranſplantation</hi> is believed to have a conſiderable ſumme, a reward propor<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ionable unto the greatneſs of his deſerts from them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Author preſents his moſt deſerved thanks to the kinde Gentleman (if he be one) for his gratefull intelligence, which he profeſſeth elſe he had been a ſtranger ſtill unto (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſo nearly concerning him) unleſs his civility had thus informed him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He is bold upon the account of his former un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provoked goodneſs to a ſtranger, to requeſt a new favour for one whom he now knows; namely, that he would be pleaſed to enquire more fully after that report (doubting it may be too good news to be true) and if he be ſo happy to finde it out, and pleaſe but to give the Author of the Caſe of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation an aſſurance of the truth of it from himſelf, and pleaſe but to take off his vizard and ſhew who himſelf is, the Author of the Caſe doth hereby engage himſelf to call that Gentleman to an account for the ſlander, if he will not him for the bribery; and this he hopes may provoke him either to make good his impeachment, or by his ſilence to aſcertain others of his malice: but it is to be doubted that perſon hath got more by [Lying] there, then I ever have or ſhall by ſtaying here. And I do here not only challenge him, but all perſons in the world to prove that ſince ever I ſerved the State, I was corrupted by the value of a penny, but have for their ſervice expended many pounds of my own.</p>
            <p>I return now to Col. <hi>Laurence,</hi> whoſe reſolution I cannot but admire in the beginning of his Book, or rather his irreſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, in receding from the Title to his Book; there he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes an Anſwer to that ſcandalous, ſeditious Pamphlet (as he is pleaſed modeſtly to call the Caſe of Tranſplantation penned by me.) And indeed I muſt confeſs, if it were a ſcandalous, ſeditious Pamphlet, he hath anſwered it in ſome ſenſe, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116738:5"/>
is, as the image in the glaſs anſwers the face out of it; or the Echo the voice, by compoſing a rhapſody, as like a ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, ſeditious Pamphlet, as poſſibly may be; nay I will grant him more, he hath really made moſt of my Book appear falſe; that is, he hath repreſented very many things not truly: But if he be ſerious, then he did well in his Title to ſay he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it as an Anſwer; but ill to change his intentions before he had diſengaged his word pawnd: for here he tels you on the contrary, <hi>p.</hi> 1, &amp; 2. that he will not give an orderly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the diſcuſſors Arguments and Objections as they ſtand (and it ſeems for him are like to do ſo ſtill) in his Book; but for brevities ſake paſs them by as impertinencies: And that he may not take notice of the aſperſions and reflexions caſt by me on Authority.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I deſire the Reader to reflect on the heads of my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, what they were, before he do on his cenſure of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency: They are Conſiderations drawn, 1.

A Land where neither Religion ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by them as Chriſtians, nor advantage thought on as men, nor ſecurity reſpected as creatures: This is a new mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell of a Church and State beyond either <hi>Plato</hi> or S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Thomas Moores</hi> conceptions; Sure the world in the Moon have this Government among them, which is the cauſe of her ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent changes: But I believe the godly that intend for <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> will look on Religion with another eye; and the eſtated man will think profit a very pertinent argument to promote his journey; and ſafety, I ſuppoſe, when they come there will not be lookt on as ſo looſe a thing by any. In the mean time 'tis but a ſad conſideration that follows Col. <hi>Laurence</hi>'s Ho yes for <hi>Ireland,</hi> that he is of ſuch a judgement that invites

them thither, that he regards neither Arguments drawn from Religion, Intereſt, or Safety, by what Arguments ſhall they move him when he has them there?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Surely this was a good brief way indeed, a ſhort method of anſwering all the books in the world in a moment, to wave their Arguments as impertinencies for brevity ſake: But it is only orderly anſwering that he avoids: This ſure is a ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem from warre, the ſtouteſt ſouldiers love alwayes to charge ſcattered troops; But <hi>(Sir)</hi> you ſhould have firſt routed my Arguments; why what needs that? he has diſordered them without that: O that the weakeſt Armies could be but uſed as the ſtrongeſt reaſons; then Collonel <hi>Laurences</hi> ſword might be as famous as his pen, what victories ſhould we have, which now we muſt reſt our ſelves content to want? Surely I expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, where ſo much was promiſed, ſome performances; the Reader will not be converted without better demonſtrations from you; and if you carry the Tranſplantation, he'll think 'twas by reaſon of your force, not by the force of your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but you do it to be courteous to me, to paſſe by my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on Authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Surely, if your kindeneſſe, have obſerved ſo many of my defects in this kinde (for every leaf almoſt is dapled with malicious, ſcandalous, ſlanderous, weak, malignant, impudent incendiary, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> 'twas well for me your cruelty was aſleep; you have hidden this fault, as a Lady does a little pimple, by placing over it a great ſpot, which makes her more remark't, how ill or deſervedly that will hereafter appear.</p>
            <p>Leaving Reaſon therefore he deſcends to write a Hiſtory, 1. Of the Authority by which this was done. 2. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of it. 3. The Manner in it. 4. My Miſtakes; and then with a ſingle Argument he pickeers on the States behalf, and attempts the anſwering ſome Objections.</p>
            <p>And ſurely the firſt three of theſe (to ſo mean an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as mine) might have been put into the rank of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies, and not inſiſted on by him; for I think no body queſtions but there was Authority for this reſult, and I never thought, nor any ſave their enemies, but that they did it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on grounds and motives, and with good intentions: and what
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116738:6"/>
has been in purſuance thereof hitherto acted in <hi>Ireland,</hi> was not examined by the caſe of Tranſplantation, nor cenſured; but only what might happen if tranſplanting ſhould be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on (generally) in probability pointed at, according to my judgement. I reaſoned concerning the good or bad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Tranſplantation, and produced Arguments to prove the latter; To anſwer all which, he tels us great wonders, 'Twas reſolved on by Authority, and that for ſome reaſons too, and has been purſued in <hi>Ireland,</hi> things which all men know, but how they need to be inſerted here, I know not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But that's my ignorance, for this was cauſed by my ſelf; who blame the Authority in <hi>Ireland</hi> for its Obedience to the Authority in <hi>England,</hi> and accuſe both for cruelty and weakneſſe, <hi>pag.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. of his Book, and many wayes in mine reflect on both: To which I anſwer.</p>

               <hi>Laurence</hi> is ſo indulgent, as not to preſs me with the proof of any of them; His Aſſertions therefore I ſhall confront with my Actions, and leave the Reader to judge the truth of the firſt, and the honeſty of the ſecond. Having had the honour to be choſen a Member of the laſt Parliament, among many other things, the great Affair of tranſplanting the Iriſh, came to be the matter of ſome diſcourſe: Being imployed thither (for <hi>Ireland)</hi> I did not foreſee, I confeſſe, that it would be a ſinne of ſo deep a die, as it ſeems it is, nay be a complication of ſo many groſſe enormities, if I did happen to ſpeak my minde in that affair; and not dictate Magiſterially, but ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the beſt reaſon that I had to back it; This I did, and at the requeſt of ſome Members, that it might paſſe the Teſt of the reſt, caſt it into that Paper wherein it was publiſht, with as honeſt an intention (I dare ſay) as Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> prints the defiance to it, though (it may be) not with ſo good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe: They that have ſo much time to waſte, in reading my folly and his wiſdom in our papers, will without being bribed by either of us, quickly paſſe ſentence who abounds moſt in abuſe. Was there ſuch an <hi>Hidra</hi> of miſchiefs (as he cha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ges on me) in venturing to debate a reſolution not yet commenc't
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116738:6"/>
into Action? This was the Parliaments fault with me. Why did not the Parliament underſtand the horridneſs of this fact? and if wiſe to underſtand it, why not juſt to puniſh it? It was their Authority enacted it (according to Collonel <hi>Laurence)</hi> and ſo (if any) theirs was oppoſed, cenſured, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not that in <hi>Ireland;</hi> Now what the Parliaments thoughts were of this, the Gentleman that uſhered in Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi>'s book with his letter, tell us, <hi>That the Iriſh had great hopes in that Parliament,</hi> but God be thanked they were blaſted by their happy diſſolution; Thus Parliaments are made by ſome men to go with ſcrews to be ſet higher or lower, as may pleaſe their fancies or ſerve their humours.</p>
            <p>But is this the reverence this Reſpondent has for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment likewiſe (whom he pretends in ſome places ſo much for) thus to abuſe the Members of it, as he hath me? Beſides, by the Reſpondents law, nothing (though never ſo ill done) ſhould be reverſt, though on grounds never ſo well ſpoken, when even things but in motion may not be ventilated? How long has Authority been ſuch a tender eye with this perſon, that it might not be toucht? Sure 'tis but ſince he has got to be in a little himſelf; and all others but ſo far regarded, as they may exalt his, elſe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Laurence</hi> (probably) may finde Arguments of another nature; they are but men like others, The ſervants of the people, God reſpects not perſons, nor muſt we make an Idol of man, <hi>Not many mighty, but God hath choſen the fooliſh to confound the wiſe; Chriſt muſt rule,</hi> &amp;c. I deſire to know of the Reſpondent, if he hath never interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Reaſons in publick State affairs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to which he was not call'd, as the Diſcuſſor was to the Parliament?</p>
            <p>You ſee what the Authority is that he does ſo revere (him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his contrivances and intereſts) and the oppoſing this, is to be an Incendiary, Malignant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and you muſt take this for a general Rule in the Affairs of <hi>Ireland;</hi> that if in the leaſt thing you happen not point-vice to cloſe with Collonel <hi>Laurence,</hi> but O if you ſhould have the unhappineſſe and the impudence both to oppoſe what comes from this <hi>Tripos!</hi> If you diſpleaſe but a Landprizado that is in his Livery, that very day you commence an enemy to the State, and the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116738:7"/>
ſad influence will ſit cloſer to you then if you were born under a three-peny planet; You are blaſted for ever, and your infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my fires in a train; he that never-ſaw you ſhall rail at you for a Malignant upon Publick Faith; and you are ſlain with the white pouder of ſecret whiſpers, you cannot tell by whom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But now on the contrary, how all things are lawfull for ſome men, nay are virtues, nay a duty, and the more exorbitant you are, the more excellent (as not fearing the perſons of men) ſo farre is it from contemning Authority?</p>
            <p>Can you hardly reade Engliſh, and ſo not likely to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the language of the Law in French or Latine? Or are you a fool, and do not underſtand the reaſon of the Law? Or have you a minde to rule arbitrarily your ſelf? why then you may rail and petition againſt the Law according to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome to have it pull'd down: Yet this is not maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though ſo long (and by ſo much Authority) ſetled, though it be an Ax to cut off the neck of all Authority at one blow? Have the Dominions of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> a minde to reward the ſervices of their principal Commander<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the honour of Protector; why you may, nay you are bound, ſay ſome, to bear their Teſtimony againſt it, and yet I never heard that Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> was ſo offended as to vindicate Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt theſe in print; if the leaſt crum go but awry with him, he may have Petitions framed, remonſtrate, conſult, complain, and yet be no Incendiary; O that <hi>Achilles</hi> mother had dipt us all, that ſo we might have become invulnera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble! But alas we are of <hi>Adams</hi> image, ſinfull and naked like him. Indeed if Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> has ſuffer'd for his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by the Author of the Caſe of Tranſplantation, he may glory in it, as being the firſt Martyr of his Judgement upon the fyle for ſuch a Cauſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though (Collonel <hi>Laurence,</hi> having accuſed me only in general terms, without ſhewing in particular wherein this great Malignancy lies, or what my reflections on Authority are) I might content my ſelf with this general Anſwer, yet becauſe, though it is the ſafeſt way, for a ſlanderer to make his charge general as he hath done; yet it is not ſo for him that can fully manifeſt his innocence, and anſwers: I ſhall take
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:116738:7"/>
leave (not to anſwer him, but others whom he may have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with this opinion of me, becauſe it may be they are ſtrangers to me, and that Authority that is in <hi>Ireland,</hi> both Civil and Martial, whom he intimates to have reſented ſuch a dealing from me) to annex theſe enſuing lines in order to their Satisfaction, and my own fuller vindication.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That I have not the leaſt ſiniſter opinion of the Civil Government of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or the Army, but on the contrary did, and do juſtly honour the wiſdom and juſtice of the Lord Deputy and Councel, and the godlineſſe, courage and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Officers and Souldiers in general; and therefore had no ſecret embers in my breaſt from whence any flames a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them might break forth, and no contrivements or deſigns againſt them, but rather their profit and higheſt reputation in my eye, and to ſet it up and advance it in my place, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my mean abilities, knowing thoſe perſons to have been the inſtruments of many glorious things for the time paſt in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and my deſires are they may be ſo in their poſterities there for many generations to come. The greater have their ſlanders been, who taking the advantage of my being in <hi>England,</hi> have made it their buſineſſe to ſtir up animoſities in the Army of <hi>Ireland</hi> againſt me, as if in my being here, I had negotiated divers things prejudicial to their Intereſt, and in particular that by my means relief was obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from being ſent unto them; My innocency in which, as I muſt here plead to them, and to all moderate perſons, not already ingaged as my enemies; ſo I do here publickly diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow all acts of the like kinde againſt them, as horrible calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ſpread abroad to my danger and defamation by malicious perſons privately, who dare not offer themſelves to juſtifie the leaſt part of their Libels in publick. But on the contrary, I do hereby promiſe to make it appear before any perſons of piety and honour, either of the Army or out of it, that all that ever I propounded in <hi>England</hi> did exceedingly tend to advance the intereſt of the Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> of which had I been the moſt eminent member, I could not have told for my life how to have ſtudied the good of it more; The truth of which I do not doubt but a little time will manifeſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:116738:8"/>
Yet I ſhall not deny but when I was in a civil imploiment for the State in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I had ſome ſharp conflicts with ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Officers for dealing unjuſtly with the Countrey, which I did and can make appear, and I thought I was bound not to fear a man with a Sword, but defend the oppreſſed, according to the truſt repoſed in me; I confeſſe I did not flatter ſuch men, nor never ſhall vail to any diſhoneſt courſe, but yet what I did I did openly, and maintained legally, and am ſo far from repenting, that on the like occaſions I ſhould repeat the like actions; This gained me thoſe enemies, who never having any thing that they durſt defend againſt me openly, have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to taint my reputation with private whiſpers. I deſire ſuch ſecret murderers of my fame may finde no credit, whoſe very private way of ſlandering, will among judicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons beget a greater jealouſie of themſelves then me: If they ſpeak truth, why do they not juſtifie it publickly? If a lie, why do they attempt to ſneak it into mens thoughts pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately? Why do they not oppoſe my plainneſſe with plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and urge me publickly, as I have done them? Theſe are the perſons, and theſe the wayes whereby I am endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be made an enemy to the State and Army; The Engliſh of which is, Becauſe they hate me, but cannot hurt me, they will entitle the State to the cauſe when it is their own private, believing then, men will condemn me, who elſe would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them; Suppoſing them to defend the States innocence, when indeed they only vent their own malice; for Collonel <hi>Laurence,</hi> though no juſter, yet he has been a nobler enemy, he has ſpoken loudly; I would he had plainly (nay ſometimes) truly; he ſayes, I reflect much on Authority! But, 1. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect is a hard word, and of a wide ſignificancy, who can write thing but ſo good a wit as his joyned with ſome diſguſt againſt the perſon may draw it to reflect on any thing? 2. Reflecting is the obſcureſt way of injuring; and if Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> had not been too nice a Critick on the behalf of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, plain men, who only ſee down right abuſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it may be might not have ſeen thoſe reflections. And laſtly, If they be but reflections, they are the immuteſt injuries that may be; but I am ſure he hath not (reflected) but fallen down
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:116738:8"/>
right outragiouſly on me for that which himſelf confeſſes is but a reflection, without proof that it is, or naming what it is; and I believe upon examination will be found not to be my refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but his miſinterpretation; He would have helpt me mightily, if he had named any particulars, but his negligence has awakened my diligence both to reperuſe that trifle of the Caſe of Tranſplantation, and to enquire diligently after what others might think or have heard theſe reflections were; for I can avow my heart to have been ſo clear from intending any thing of this nature, that I am aſſured it muſt be either mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking my meaning, or my own unhappy expreſſing of it, or my enemies wilfull perverting of it, that can engage my words to a ſenſe (not only ſo different from, but) abhor'd by my very thoughts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All therefore that I have heard from others, or can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine my ſelf in the leaſt degree to be in thoſe papers miſtaken or perverted to a reflection on Authority, I ſhall ſet down here faithfully, with the meaning I intended them, that ſo (which is of higheſt conſequence) Authority may be cleared by me, and (which is as much my deſires as hopes, that) I may not be eſteemed guilty by Authority.</p>

               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. The grinding of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> (ſpoken of there) with heavy preſſures, to the deſtruction of more Families a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, under our Protection, then out of it. To which I anſwer.</p>
            <p>That this was a Narration of what has happened to them, not a complaint that it has befallen them, nor an accuſation of thoſe inſtruments by whom it has befallen, but brought in here to ſhew they are hardned in their Superſtition by it, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever cauſe it ſprung from: Here is nothing ſpoken, that the cauſe of this aroſe not from themſelves, or not from neceſſity and juſtice in us, but the contraay is often expreſſed in that Book, in theſe vindicating phraſes, the States wants, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies neceſſities, <hi>pag.</hi> 23. Now it is not the doing of a thing,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:116738:9"/>
but the grounds on which it is done, that makes moſt actions unwarrantable, which grounds are ſo far from being condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on the part of Authority in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that they are not queſtioned, but ſuppoſed as clear to all; for it is obvious to common underſtandings, that the warre againſt thoſe Rebels was juſt, and therefore juſtly to be proſecuted; and this could not be done without money; and for <hi>England</hi> to defray the whole charge of a numerous Army ſo long to attend that war, could not be expected, eſpecially its own warre with <hi>Holland,</hi> and many other great additional expences intervening: who then ſhould ſuffer, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, or the <hi>Iriſh</hi> inhabitant? The laſt ſure, ſuppoſe him in the capacity of a Rebel it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to deſtroy him; and ſuppoſe him in the condition of a Subject, it was juſt for him to preſerve us; The <hi>Engliſh</hi> were large contributers there, why ſhould not the <hi>Iriſh?</hi> The <hi>Iriſh</hi> begun the Rebellion, they were the fitteſt to help to end it; Now that this went ſo cloſe with them, as to undo them, aroſe from our neceſſity, not will; and from their precedent po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty in maintaining the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army againſt <hi>England.</hi> That more Families were undone among us then them, aroſe hence, That ſingle men became Souldiers among them, and fought againſt us, generally thoſe that had Families came in, and ſo fell among theſe preſſures; and therefore, I ſaid, more Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were undone under our Protection then out of it. Now that I did not ſet down all theſe things punctually in that Treatiſe, was not becauſe they were not true, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not pertinent; My buſineſſe was not there to write a Panegyrick for the State, and accumulate all their Praiſe-worthy actions, nor to write any thing in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, whom I ſaw no honeſt man accuſe, but to give a ſhort account of the matter of Tranſplantation, and an hiſtorical report of fact where it was neceſſary in order thereto, without putting in my cenſures or approbations of every ſingle act, or rendring the reaſons of each particular, which would have ſwell'd it to a Volume; I was not aware, I confeſſe, of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Interpreter, who would take my words abſolutely, and not conſider the account they were brought in upon, for thus we may make what we will of any thing, Loyalty may be

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It may do ſo, but it muſt be only with thoſe that are reſolved pertinaciouſly to cleave to miſtakes after they have read what I write, whatever they did before; For this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
            <p>What is it that I am proving there? 'Tis, that after Juſtice is done on a Community, Mercy may take place; which Mercy that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> may taſte of, I ſhew Juſtice is done on them; To make which appear, I inſtance all theſe particulars. Is not this to ſhew the State hath done juſtly, and what they have ſuffer'd, they have ſuffer'd juſtly? Where's the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt our Governors and Government? Is it that they have done juſtly? Do I not there prove, that Juſtice muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily precede Mercy; and then prove, that it hath done ſo? And is the proving of Juſtice done, the proving a thing done unjuſtly? If any be condemned there 'tis the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> be abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, 'tis Authority; Who uſes to ſuffer Juſtice? the guilty: to do it? the innocent; And yet (by this miſtake) to ſay, the State has done Juſtice, is to make them guilty, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> has ſuffer'd it, to make them innocent: This is to make the Judge the Thief, and the Thief the Judge; Pray put but the word Juſtice to every part of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſuffering there mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then ſee what you can charge me for charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the State with; The frowns there mentioned are reſtrained (by the word ſome) to particular perſons, and ſuch, I ſay, ſtill there are, though they frown more on

me. Nor have their diſguſts herein terminated in me, but moderate, equitable perſons even of eminency in the Army it ſelf, have born their part with me, in particular the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Cork</hi> for his (in tenderneſſe of the States honour) defending from injury ſuch poor <hi>Iriſh,</hi> as put themſelves under their ſhelter, has ſuffer'd many unjuſt defamations, becauſe he labour'd to preſerve others from injuſtice.</p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>Pag. 24. line</hi> 6 I write of the incredible oppreſſion of the Souldiers, and ſeem to intimate the like of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, by ſaying, The people have juſt cauſes to fear to complain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I do believe that the Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> is the beſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin'd Army in the world, except that in <hi>England,</hi> whereof it is a part: Yet I believe likewiſe, that there never was an Army (except of Angels, where the Lord of Hoſts was Captain) that had not ſome that ſwerv'd from the integrity of the reſt. I ſaid no more (but ſome) and I believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will ſay no leſſe, I do not accuſe all, neither will they excuſe all; and for theſe things going unpuniſhed for their juſt fear to complain, it touches not the moſt ſubordinate, much leſſe the Supream Officer: for the Officers not knowing it, keeps him juſt; and yet the private Souldiers power over the peaſant, may make his fear juſt too; for though it lie in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> mans power to complain of a firſt injury, yet it lies in the pooreſt Souldiers power to do him another, that ſhall put him (it may be)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> paſt complaining, or put ſuch a ſpecious colour on it, as may give it the face of Juſtice, and then who will not believe an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Souldier, rather then an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Teige, if the matter ſhould come to diſpute; So then, though the cauſe be unjuſt in the Souldier, yet it may be juſt in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer, who may fear juſtly to complain of injury, leaſt he be injur'd more by complaining.</p>
            <p>Theſe were all the things ſubject to ſcruple in that Treatiſe (which I could either conjecture or learn from others) ſave what is referrible to the ſame heads, and ſo being the ſame Objections, the ſame Anſwers will aſſoyl them; If I could have met any others, I ſhould as eaſily have untied them, as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:116738:11"/>
theſe, but not able to divine what they are, muſt leave them to the Readers wiſdom and charity, who from what I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered already may reaſon to what I might to the reſt, and will perceive how unjuſt thoſe multiplications were of my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Authority, which are ſcatter'd every where in Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Laurence</hi> his Book, and his unworthy cenſures on me, ſuppoſing me ſo to have done. I reverence Authority as highly, as I prize Col. <hi>Laurence</hi> ſlightly, who has diſcovered but his own weakneſſe or malice, whileſt he attempted to blaſt my innocence; And ſurely he is more beholding to his Buckler then Sword; The States cauſe (which he pretends to maintain) then his own, which he is not able; for had he not interwoven his ſo many abuſes of me with the colourable pretext of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, ſo that 'tis a hard matter to touch him but he will cry they are wounded, I ſhould not have ſpared the unripping of a multitude more of his obſervable indiſcretions then I have done in this Book; which were ſtuft in by him without any reaſon, and are overpaſt by me for this reaſon.</p>
            <p>Thus I hope I have evidenc't that I have not injured Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in general; This may ſatisfie them; but I cannot my ſelf, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe I do right eminently unto one eminent particular perſon in it, who has no leſſe merited from me, then he deſerves to do from all others; I mean his Excellency the Lord Deputy that now is of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who as he had the chiefeſt power in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging this buſineſſe of Tranſplantation, (as of all other things tranſacted in that Land) ſo if any thing were ſaid by me that intrencht on Authority, it might ſeem more directly to reflect on him; and therefore I hold my ſelf obliged particularly to give ſome account of my ſelf in this thing, as of his integrity in that; Not ſo much that he needs my doing him right, as to ſhew how much I abhorre the doing him wrong; And all men muſt ſee this now to ariſe from neceſſity not flattery. He is certainly a fountain of much good to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſtands in the gap between that poor people, and much ill; A perſon made rich with thoſe excellent endowments that inable men to command, and prepare others to obey; One of whom I ſhould ſay more, but for fear to injure his modeſty, and of whom I could ſay no leſſe to defend my own innocency.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:116738:12"/>
I muſt as a percloſe to this, keep the Reader from being miſlead by ſome <hi>Errata</hi>'s in this his Hiſtory, which are not reſerved (as in other Books for the latter end) but enter at the beginning, and diſperſe themſelves throughout.</p>
            <p>1. He here begins with a ſolemn tale of the Authority by which this was enacted, a Parliament. 2. Nay ſeveral Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments. 3. On mature deliberation, and on this ground loads me with calumnies, that I ſhould deſpiſe ſo great power, ſo much wiſdom. But the Reader muſt know, that this is all otherwiſe, to ſpeak modeſtly of it; for, Tranſplantation was given out in Orders by the Councel of State. 2. Ratified only by the little Parliament. 3. Not long by them debated, for it was never ſo much as once read. 4. But it was not yet put in execution. 5. That it might not, the addreſſe was to the Parliament by a Member call'd lawfully to ſpeak his minde, only his reaſons given for his apprehenſions; where is the Malignancy, ſingularity, ſlander (in all this) that he every where belcheth out againſt me?</p>
            <p>But I perceive by what he writes at the bottom of <hi>p.</hi> 3. That 'tis not my writing ſo much as my ſelf, that he quarrels with; for before, laying to my charge, that I aſperſt Authority, he is here offended with me for acquitting Authority, and is reſolved neither to be pleaſed with my doing one or the other; I muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment my hard fate, and admire his dexterity, that can manage a cauſe both for and againſt the Commonwealth, and yet be ſtill Champion for Authority; and on the contrary, whether I argue againſt, or for it, I muſt ſtill continue an enemy to Authority.</p>
            <p>He is ſo eager on Tranſplantation, that he tranſplants my very Book, the latter end here to the beginning, and my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning (or Arguments) to the latter end, <hi>pag.</hi> 3. of his, where his intention is to take away the force of thoſe reaſons, which I produce in the behalf of Authority, to juſtifie their enacting the Law of Tranſplantation, though I apprehended inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies in the executing of it, and this is the firſt eſſay of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Authority, the endeavouring to diſprove my juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them, and the proof he gives them of my malignan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: but to view it more particularly.</p>
            <p>1. He is offended <hi>Pag.</hi> 4. (who pleaded for Authority all this
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:116738:12"/>
while) that I did not lay the ill conſequents of Tranſplantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on them directly and ſolely, but force in others to take off the envy from them, he hugely magnifies the Parliaments wiſdome above being ſo hoodwinkt by others, and miſlead by ſtrangers (as I ſeem to ſay) whom floutingly (he continues) they needed not ſend for into <hi>Ireland</hi> to conſult with, having had enough in <hi>England</hi> to adviſe with that were ſtrangers to that Land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. He takes it for granted, that the Parliament gave life to the Order for Tranſplantation, which is a miſtake, for 'twas the Councel of State, as was ſhewn before. But</p>
            <p>2. It was approved by the Parliament, nay ſeveral: that is another miſtake, for we have had but one ſince, and they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved it not.</p>
            <p>3. Not raſhly, but upon a twelve moneths deliberation, he ſaith, which is a third miſtake: for how long they would have ſa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, I know not, but all <hi>England</hi> knows the little Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did not ſit a year, and when they did ſit, did they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate on nothing but the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Tranſplantation.</p>
            <p>4. This Gentlemans memory or intelligence has much failed him, for the Inſtructions for Tranſplantation never were read in Parliament, but only confirm'd in another Act by the ſmall Parliament.</p>
            <p>5. He tels you (I ſay) there were ſome ſent for out of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to adviſe with, before Orders were given for the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation; but I ſay not any ſuch thing; and this in ſo little (but fertile ground you ſee) is his fifth (but I believe will not be the laſt miſtake.) And now I conceive you may gueſſe the reaſon, why in the entrance of his Hiſtory <hi>(Pag.</hi> 2.) he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes memory and underſtanding (as the Poets do their Muſe) 'tis ſurely that whenever his miſtakes were detected, he might eſcape through theſe back-doors, though with the diſreputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of loſſe of underſtanding and memory both.</p>
            <p>6. In <hi>Pag.</hi> 4. of his Book, he threatens me with ſome thing no leſſe dire, and as obſcure as the influence of a Comet, if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> happen to rebel by my means, who yet ſhall be quel'd by his, and have their rebellious bloud let out. But I ſhall neither be diſturb'd at his railing <hi>(Pag.</hi> 5.) nor terrified with
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:116738:13"/>
his threatning <hi>(Pag.</hi> 4.) of letting bloud, though I know him to have been one of the engines of death; In the mean time, Let others be cautioned by my miſery, how they prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticate any effect, though never ſo clear in the cauſe, left they be made the cauſe themſelves: as here he would feign me to inſtigate a people to rebell <hi>(Pag.</hi> 4.) becauſe I ſay ſuch a courſe is likely to provoke them to it. Indeed I ſhould intreat Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> out of his great charity, to help the people of <hi>England,</hi> to have Juſtice done (who did ſuffer much this winter from inundations) upon the Almanack-makers, for they fore-told there would be great rain, and thereof certainly muſt be as much the Authors, as I, if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> rebel, of their inſurrection; But I pray God in ſuch evil likelihoods, that I may ever be miſtaken. I deſire not to have a Countrey rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to have Prophecies verified.</p>
            <p>Secondly, At <hi>Pag.</hi> 5. he is offended, that I ſay, the face of things, is much differed in <hi>Ireland</hi> (it may be I ſaid differed, but is <hi>differed</hi> is non-ſenſe, and his own term) but tell him not whether to the better or the worſe: yet he tels you my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I muſt mean to the worſe.</p>
            <p>And ſurely, 1. Then he hath ſhewed himſelf a charitable man, (a thing hanging doubtfull between two conſtructions) to interpret it to the worſe part: But a horſe-flie will only ſettle on a gall.</p>
            <p>2. Had I been thus impertinent, ſo much as to debate, whether <hi>Ireland</hi> could be in other then a better eſtate, then before, after an Army had quite ſubjected it, in which ſo war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and buſie an Officer as Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> was, I might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly have incurred ſo terrible a thing as his diſpleaſure; but what my meaning was, might in likelihood be beſt colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the end for which that ſentence was produc't, and that was, as he tels you, that the Tranſplantation need not be urg'd, becauſe the face of things in <hi>Ireland</hi> was much altered; Now was it a rational collection (or rather like one of his) to ſay, The <hi>Iriſh</hi> are as much, or more rebellious then ever, as high, as numerous, as powerfull, Therefore have pity on them, do not tranſplant them: Or rather thus, Their courage is exhauſted, their numbers decay'd, their Souldiers (moſt of them) ſent
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:116738:13"/>
beyond ſea, their Prieſts baniſht, the remainder lie at your feet, therefore do not tranſplant them (though heretofore you thought on that courſe) ſince now there is not the ſame neceſſity which made it then fit, but many expedients which make it now unfit; this diſcourſe he might have found more at large <hi>pag.</hi> 13. Of the caſe of Tranſplantation, which would ſufficiently have acquainted him with my meaning. But 'tis a hard matter to make one that ſtops his ears hear, or him that ſhuts his eyes ſee. He ends this Paragraph like the Moneth of <hi>March,</hi> which comes in like a Lamb, and goes out like a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: he roars againſt Incendiaries and their impudence in the concluſion, till he become all on fire himſelf, nay and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiary too, labouring to kindle the fire of diſcord in the pacifick hearts of thoſe in <hi>England.</hi> But (though I do, yet) I hope the Commonwealth ſhall not ſuffer by any flames of my kindling; for if I carry fire Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> can bring water. But I would intreat him to make uſe of it to allay the heat himſelf is in, and I will undertake to ſatisfie for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever detriment the Commonwealth ſuſtains by thoſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</p>
            <p>But his oppoſition to that which he cals my third Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the behalf of Authority (for it ſeems I am become Defendant, and he is Plaintiff in their ſuit) preſſes in for room to be heard, <hi>Pag.</hi> 5. of his, wherein mark his Rhetorick now, By a fiction of the perſon, he introduces me ſpeaking thus, That becauſe Authority did not in their goodneſſe execute, what in their wiſdoms they order'd, therefore they have ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died to make the people miſerable, that they might have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſhewing them mercy; And this is the Summe of my defence ſo farre as he can make it (hang) together. Me thinks my Arguments repriev'd from the amazement unto which it may be his threatning of hanging them together puts them, ſpeaks more recollectedly then that diſtracted ſenſe which he takes as their confeſſion from the gallows; To ſhew him this in the myſteries of his own Science; When he that is now Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> was a Marſhal, had he never a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd perſon under his juriſdiction, whom gracious Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity reſcued from execution by a mercifull reprieve, hoping
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:116738:14"/>
afterward they might have cauſe to increaſe it to pardon? O, but this ſayes he, is to bring the man into miſery to have an opportunity to ſhew mercy? No, <hi>Sir,</hi> but it is to intend mercy to a man that brought himſelf into miſery; The <hi>Iriſh</hi> caſe ſeem'd to me thus, They by an imparalell'd crime, merit an unparallel'd puniſhment, and are for a long time ſo high in their obſtinacy, that nothing but extreams can work on them. This I ſaid might put Authority on thoſe Reſolutions which was juſt in them to do (indeed) and for the other to ſuffer; but yet they loved mercy to, and will ſhew it if they may (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cruelty to themſelves) even to the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> nay, when not only the good of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> but of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> their peace, plenty and ſafety is combined with it, as was endeavoured to be ſhewn in the caſe of Tranſplantation; but as impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies theſe Arguments were not vouchſafed an Anſwer by this Gentleman; they reſpite therefore the execution of this, to ſee if any other way will bring about their ends, to ſhew, that nothing but neceſſity puts them on ſo rigid a one as this; To ſay then Authority is clement and deliberative, is to expoſe them to laughter, as he thinks, with whom theſe are ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous things; as Religion, Intereſt and Security before were impertinencies; But if that perſon that writ the Caſe of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation (after ſo much cauſe of penſiveneſſe, as he hath from the tyranny Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> wit has exerciſed over him, and the fear his power will execute his threatnings) if he could be ſtill ſo ſanguine as to recreate himſelf with a ſportive humour, he profeſſes he ſhould quit Authority, and labour to make the Collonel ridiculous rather, as being the ſafer, and by farre the eaſier task; but he needs not, he can make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo.</p>
            <p>This is the Summe of <hi>Pag.</hi> 3, 4, 5. From the 6. to the 9 he goes on in telling a ſtory what was acted in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in order to Tranſplantation; which being a tale, and not reaſon; a matter of fact related, but no Argument produced for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity or expediency of Tranſplantation, is to be put upon the ſyle of things without this Queſtion, which is not What was done, or not done; But upon a ſuppoſition of the Tranſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to be done, What is likely to follow? From which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:116738:14"/>
he argues very remotely, who tels you, what is paſt, when I ſpeak of what's to come. The Gentleman is much miſtaken, I had nothing to ſay againſt what was done in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but I had ſomething to ſay againſt what was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in <hi>England</hi> at that time when I might ſpeak, and before them to whom it was proper to ſpeak: My deſign was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent what might be done, not cenſure what was done: which things, if this perſon had not confounded but kept ſeparate in his underſtanding, he had not fallen ſo often deſperately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and foully in his own undertaking. But it ſeems he muſt politiquely make the Commonwealth an enemy, to ſhew himſelf a friend; and feign ſome body to accuſe Authority, that he might write an Apology in their Defence.</p>
            <p>And now how faithfull has Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> been to his firſt ingagement (to wave impertinencies) when we have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to had nothing at all elſe from him? which that it may appear evidently, I ſhall joyn his premiſſes as farre as we have gone, and his concluſion together, and ſee how ſtrong influence the one has upon the other.</p>
            <p>All the Inconveniences urged by the Author againſt general Tranſplantation (ſayes he) are vain terrors and panick fears, that's the concluſion: And why? For it was not the Authority of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but in <hi>England</hi> that projected it <hi>(Pag.</hi> 1.) and doubtleſſe they intended it for the <hi>Engliſhs</hi> good <hi>(Pag.</hi> 3.) and the Authority in <hi>Ireland</hi> has proceeded ſlowly in it <hi>(Pag.</hi> 7, 8.) Theſe are his Premiſſes, the Connexion is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
            <p>Well, but this is but the forlorn hope of his Book, the main body is reſerved for <hi>pag</hi> 9 where he intends to make ſtrange Diſcoveries of nothing but miſtakes in the Author of the Caſe of Tranſplantation; To which I have only thus much to ſay in general.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it ſeems he hath only ſhewed his own miſtakes all this while.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Granting mine himſelf but miſtakes, he ſhould rather have pitied a poor mans weakneſſe, then have laid ſo much malice and miſchief to his charge as he does. But ſuppoſe</p>
            <p n="3">3. The miſtakes ſhould reſt on his part ſtill. What a gulf
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:116738:15"/>
of errour has he plung'd himſelf into? Let us ſee where to fix them right.</p>
            <p>My firſt miſtake is (ſayes he, <hi>Pag.</hi> 16.) the ſuppoſing a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Tranſplantation, when but a particular was intended, and is to be practiſed.</p>
            <p>1. If this be ſo, I wonder how the Collonel came ſo to fall out with me; he intends only a particular Tranſplantation, and I write only againſt a general one; and yet he writes againſt me, and rails at me ſufficiently for writing for it; and now we are friends again; and he tels me, he intends to put in practice what I deſire; O <hi>Aedipus</hi> unfold this myſtery: Tell where the difference lies; This is like a drunken quarrel, which none can trace to the occaſion; Or like the feud between <hi>Martin Luthers</hi> Scholars, becauſe one was the Diſciple of <hi>Martin,</hi> and the other of <hi>Luther;</hi> and yet you ſee how zealouſly he maintains the ſcuffle; Surely people will take us for a couple of diſſembling Atturneys, who ſquabble at the Barre in the Court, and are agreed at the Barre in the Tavern; or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That if there was one miſtake, there were two mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes: if I was miſtaken in the Queſtion, then he muſt be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in the quarrel.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, The perfect way for his evidencing my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in this; had been to have cited the Acts and Orders for Tranſplantation, in which the Reader might have ſeen either his miſtake or mine, by the general or particular current of them; but ſince you may refuſe to believe him, if you will not take it on his credit, I ſhall deſire your aſſent no further then my witneſſe compels; Thus then runs the Order of the Councel of State, in their Inſtructions, entituled, <hi>Further Inſtructions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That all Perſons who have right to Articles or Mercy, held forth by any qualifications in the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tranſplant themſelves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>except only ſuch as did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the Rebels at any time before</hi> September 1643. <hi>and have ever ſince profeſſed the Proteſtant Religion; and women who married Engliſh Proteſtants ſince the ſecond of</hi> December 1650. <hi>and themſelves become Proteſtants.</hi> I would now deſire Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Laurence</hi> to ſpeak ingenuouſly and roundly, how many <hi>Iriſh</hi> he believes in the whole Land fals within the compaſſe of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:116738:15"/>
the exception from Tranſplantation, and whether upon ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration, he will defend (that) for a meaſured truth (which it may be come unweighed from him, <hi>pag. 17. lin.</hi> 19. of his Book) that the twentieth man was not by Order to be tranſplanted, beſides Souldiers, of which many are gone beyond Seas? I appeal to thoſe who knew the condition of <hi>Ireland</hi> in thoſe times, whether thoſe Inſtructions adhered to, would not tranſplant almoſt every man? How is it poſſible to be otherwiſe, when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were hem'd in to their very gates, and the whole Land became a wilde rode for the Rebels, if it were poſſible for any conſiderable number to be innocent, it muſt be thoſe who inhabited with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in their Towns? And yet (to take the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Inhabitants of <hi>Kinſale</hi> for example) theſe were judged ſo clearly tranſplantable, that in order thereto their whole Eſtates had been diſpos'd of, had not the timely clemency of his Excellency the Lord Deputy ſtept in for their relief.</p>
            <p>3. The Authority there makes but two diſtinctions of men, 1. Thoſe that are to die. 2. Thoſe to be tranſplanted; From whence is it not rational to ſay, all thoſe are to be tranſplanted that are to live; and do they not name expreſly plowmen, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when they ſay they ſhall not die? There is no <hi>Medium</hi> in that Article between dying and tranſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>But fourthly, I ſhall make him, who has been my accuſer all this while my Judge now (And if you judge of what's to come by what's paſt, you may think he will not be partial on my ſide;) if you pleaſe to look into <hi>pag.</hi> 11. of his Book, there you ſhall ſee in a different Character theſe words, <hi>That all perſons who have right to Articles, or any favour or mercy held forth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>All and every the perſons afore-ſaid, ſhall before the 1 of</hi> May, 1654. <hi>tranſplant themſelves into Connaught,</hi> &amp;c. I wonder what reſtriction or limitation is here to deny a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tranſplantation; All pardoned for life and eſtate are to go; What can be more general, unleſſe he will ſuppoſe thoſe that loſt their lives might go too by a more then Pythagorick tranſmigration? Nay, what he here denies, and makes the root of all my Errour, what will you ſay if himſelf grant, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:116738:16"/>
ſay the ſelf-ſame thing elſwhere? View <hi>Pag.</hi> 7. of his Book, <hi>lin. 10. For though the Parliament in their (Inſtructions) included all perſons within any the qualifications in the Act of Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> &amp;c. Is not this to grant what I ſay, to conclude the Parliament included all? They are their words, as he quotes them himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be ſaid, This is foul play to diſmember a ſentence; Hear what he ſayes after <hi>(Yet in their Declarations thereon, they confine it to Propriators of Land or Perſons, who had been in actual Rebellion,</hi> &amp;c.) this turns the currant againſt me again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I believe he intended it ſhould do ſo, but yet it does not; You may ſee by his gloſſe he had a good minde to have corrupted the Text, for theſe laſt are his words, not Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as you may ſee by his next words <hi>(or to uſe their own words)</hi> i. e. the Parliaments; Now what are the Parliaments words (according as he was feign to cite them?) Reade on there, and they ſay thus, <hi>That all Perſons that had contrived, adviſed, promoted, acted, or voluntarily aided, aſſiſted or abetted the Rebellion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Or have been in actual Arms;</hi> Good Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Laurence</hi> are none but Propriators of Lands or Perſons in actual Rebellion intended here to tranſplant? Pray firſt of all tell us, What you mean by actual Rebellion, for I perceive you intend this fig<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leaf to hide your nakedneſſe withall; you ſeem to mean thoſe that were actually in Arms? But then if Propriators of Land and Souldiers were only intended, what's the meaning of theſe additions <hi>(adviſed, promoted, aſſiſted, or abetted)</hi> do they ſignifie ſomething, or are they the Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologies of Authority? They may be inſignificant now they are urged againſt you; but I warrant them recover their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, when you come to lay the Law to the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> or do you mean a third ſort, beſide the Propriator and Souldier (by being in actual Rebellion?) Indeed this is the true ſenſe of the word; there is no middle between Loyalty and Rebellion; to adviſe, promote, aſſiſt, abet, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> is Rebellion (if it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally only, it comes not under mans cognizance) and if actual, 'tis actual Rebellion? The Collonels meaning then is this, That though the Inſtructions of Authority include all, yet in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:116738:16"/>
their Declarations they confine it <hi>(To all)</hi> this is a ſtrange oppoſition, a pretty univerſal reſtriction: 'Tis ſtrange Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority would let their Inſtructions and Declarations run ſo at odds, and interfere ſo mightily: Sure I am he muſt mean one of theſe two ſenſes, unleſſe perhaps to evade me he'll ſay he means non ſenſe: if the firſt; then he becomes an Advocate for the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and excuſes them all from actual Rebellion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Landedmen and Souldiers; if the ſecond, then (which he dreads more) he pleads for me, and againſt himſelf, excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing none from Tranſplantation; if the firſt, he abuſes Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, if the ſecond, his Reader; into theſe difficulties has he ingaged himſelf, to ingage me; <hi>Sir,</hi> How much reaſon have we here to invoke your truth and modeſty, as in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you did your memory and underſtanding; I beſeech you hereafter learn to ſpeak leſſe confidently, or reſolve to ſpeak more truly; Though your paſſion may prompt you to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict me, yet let your reaſon curb you from (thus groſly) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting your ſelf.</p>
            <p>5. Obſerve, That though you may perceive Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> to be a very learned man by the many Books he quotes in his Tract (as the <hi>Act of Settlement, Further Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Orders,</hi> &amp;c.) Yet he has been very unhappy in his apprehenſion of them (as many times great Readers have ſmall judgements) for the truth is, Authority in that Act of Settlement in the part cited by him, ſpeaks not of tranſplanting thoſe that were in Rebellion, or had adviſed, aſſiſted, abetted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into <hi>Connaught,</hi> but ſomewhat further even out of the world; as you may ſee the words in the cloſe of the Act of Settlement, <hi>Artic. 1. All thoſe before, nay thoſe who have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed Money or Victuals (which they cannot make appear to have been taken away from them by meer force) ſhall be excepted from pardon of life and eſtate;</hi> How ſhall we ſalve this cruell capital miſtake for Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> (truly I know no way but this) That though this be not an account of Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi>'s reaſon, it is of his faith; that he is no <hi>Sadducee,</hi> he holds there are Spirits, and that they can walk, and may be tranſplanted, and poſſeſſe Eſtates: Yet I believe, becauſe they are Spirits, they need not ſuch bodily proviſions
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:116738:17"/>
as we doe, and therefore are to be ſent into <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. There has been lately a Petition by ſome in ſeveral Counties in <hi>Ireland,</hi> preferr'd to the Authority there, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> might be generally tranſplanted, becauſe the Orders of the Councel of State did ſo require. It ſeems I am not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle in the conſtruction of thoſe Orders.</p>
            <p>I have the longer inſiſted on this, for that it is the hinge of the whole controverſie between the Reſpondent and me, who fals vehemently upon me, that I ſhould abuſe Authority with an Act they never intended; inforcing this every where into his Book, and impoſing it upon the Reader with ſuch ardour and frequency, that he is almoſt afraid not to think it to be true; yet upon examination of Records it appears falſe, his own teſtimonies make him give up the Bucklers; and upon thoſe proofs I crave the ſentence of all unprejudicated perſons, Whether I had not reaſon (being a Member of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for <hi>Ireland)</hi> to repreſent my ſenſe to them of ſuch an Order (as Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> will not abuſe them with once intending to act in?) Or whether he had juſt provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo to abuſe me, and himſelf too? This then which he cals my miſtake proves to be his; and he cals it my firſt (which acknowledgement from an opponent is worthy of thanks) but he muſt excuſe me from making him the like civil return, for it is not his firſt by a great many.</p>
            <p>There is one Objection againſt me from <hi>Pag.</hi> 9. and 10. of his Book, that ſuppoſing the Orders to be general; however there is no ſuch thing in preparation or practice in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but rather that they have admitted conſcientious and prudent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates concerning it; To which I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then it ſeems they condemned general tranſplanting, and I deſired (and endeavoured) only againſt that. I hope then Authority there, will not own Col. <hi>Laurence</hi>'s clamours againſt me, who moved in their own ſphere; nor cenſure my ſubſerviency to themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> told you, they had Orders out of <hi>England</hi> for doing this, and I do not underſtand what place is left for the conſultation of Inferiours, after the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:116738:17"/>
of Superiours, eſpecially who cry up their own obedience ſo much as he. Let him anſwer this Objection, I cannot for him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But now he ſpeaks more broadly, and ſayes, They are reſolved on a particular Tranſplantation, and you ſaw <hi>England</hi> reſolved on a general; which is to ſay, he reſolves not to obey; ſome men may ſay any thing, but I tremblingly now repeat it after him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If this be the reſolution, I know not, that I deſerved ſuch rude thanks for endeavouring to obtain an Order for it; But however I ſhall be glad of the event (being poſſeſt of my poor deſign in it) and leave it to ſome more turbulent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, to diſpute whether it be by Order or not.</p>
            <p n="5">5. 'Tis his Reſolution, and 'tis not his Reſolution: It is his Reſolution for the preſent; but it may be not for the time to come; The Tranſplantation may be but particular now, but it may be general hereafter; Hear his intimation of it, <hi>pag.</hi> 10. of his Book. When (ſayes he) there ſhall as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon appear for tranſplanting the whole as a part, then the Diſcuſſer may offer his Arguments, and the Actors their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, but (for the preſent) no ſuch preparation. He tels you only then what is reſolved at the preſent, not what may be acted for the future, when any man ſtarts new reaſons, but <hi>p.</hi> 17. he ſpeaks more plainly; whether all ſhall go at one time or not (ſayes he) is diſputable.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Conſider if this be likely (whatever may be done at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) from theſe two Propoſitions put together; He tels you, <hi>Pag. 17. lin.</hi> 19. the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to be tranſplanted are not the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of the Nation, nay ſo inconſiderable they cannot be miſt, but as one friend may miſſe another; and yet almoſt all <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught</hi> is laid out for them.</p>
            <p>Let us proceed to what he cals my ſecond Miſtake, which is (as he ſaith) my Arguments againſt a promiſcuous Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation without reſpect to merit or behaviour, and that (ſayes he) is not ſo. In anſwer to which conſider</p>
            <p>Firſt, I think it had been a Miſtake to have written for a Tranſplantation without reſpect to merit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I conceive none to oppoſe it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:116738:18"/>
Secondly, If it was a miſtake in me to write for it, it will be a greater in him to act for it, which yet he profeſſes to do; and I am glad he complies with me in his deeds, though he ſeems to be at variance by his words.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If the Orders ran for a generall Tranſplantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then for a promiſcuous one doubtleſſe, for non-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous makes a difference, and general ſuppoſes none; but the firſt was proved before, and therefore the ſecond needs no proof now.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As the Reſolution is pious in the Authority there to make a diſtinction, ſo I wiſh the Obedience may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be cheerfull in the Executioners to perform it; the merit is ſo ſmall on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> part, that their rewards will be more juſt then coſtly; But unleſſe this Rule be better kept (generally) for the time to come, then it has been in ſome particulars (that I could name) for the time paſt (but I am confident) without the fault, or ſo much as knowledge of Authority, we ſhall have no cauſe to boaſt of our ſignall recompences, nor the poſſeſſors to rejoyce in them: But I have better hopes for the time to come; to reſolve well is to begin to do well; and this the Gentleman profeſſes, and I ſhall in charity believe him till his actions diſingage me.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Then it appears that this is no poiſoned Arrow ſhot by me at Authority, as he ſayes <hi>(Pag.</hi> 10. of his Book) but rather that his cenſure is a bolt of his, too ſoon let flie at me.</p>
            <p>My third Miſtake (he tels you) is, that I think Tranſplanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was principally propoſed as a puniſhment for murther, and thereupon grounds a large Diſcourſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I was not ſo fooliſh to think my ſelf ſo wiſe, as to pretend to know the reaſon of Tranſplantation, which (though I have ſince heard the Reſpondent ſpeak, 'tis my dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) I do not even now conceive; but then, though I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the State has reaſon for it above my apprehenſion, or if they had not, I ſhould yet in duty ſubmit, looking upon it as a work (to my poor capacity) of very threatning conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, I thought (if it were done) it muſt be on very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringent
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:116738:18"/>
motives; and I thought there were none more bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding then Religion, Profit and Safety; the firſt of which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted from <hi>Pag.</hi> 1. to the 15. under which head comes the paſſage that he aſſaults here.</p>
            <p>2. Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> will be but an ill Souldier if he cannot diſcern his friends from his enemies; What confuſion may he bring upon an Army? 1. It cannot be my ground (for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes) I reaſon againſt it: 2. But it is one that I have heard from thoſe of his judgement often inculcated, and I believe he that denies this to be the reaſon, will not ſuddenly be prepar'd to aſſign a better.</p>
            <p>3. He is again miſtaken, for this, that Tranſplantation was done on the account of puniſhment, was not a poſition, but a ſuppoſition, not an aſſertion faſtned on Authority, or any one elſe, but an indefinite Objection which might have been uſed by any body, and (it may be) was by ſome body, or if not, yet might have been, or may be, and it ſhews only his care that writ the Caſe of Tranſplantation, not to pretermit any thing that might poſſibly be ſaid againſt him, ſo farre was he from his Antagoniſts humour, to ſlide by all the Arguments againſt him as impertinencies; which different proceeding (it may be) was that which moſt offended this Gentleman, looking on it as his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
            <p>4. He ſayes, This was not the Reaſon of Tranſplantation; then it ſeems there is one reaſon leſſe for it then I thought there had been.</p>
            <p>5. If it was not, it might have been; It may be the Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent did not perceive its force, and ſo (not knowing how it could ſerve his turn) disbanded it; for certainly he has ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not much reaſon to ſpare in this controverſie, or it lies in ambuſh for us; and indeed I ſhould be much ſurpriz'd to ſee it.</p>
            <p>6. I have only his bare word, That puniſhment was not a principle of Tranſplantation; and ſo firſt I am left to my good nature, whether I will believe him or no. 2. I have no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to believe him, for then I muſt believe my ſelf a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, incendiary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> having the ſame Author for both.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:116738:19"/>
3. I have reaſon not to believe him; for, 1. He was in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> (and this Order came from <hi>England,</hi> and therefore) was not at the debates, and ſo could not know the motives fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then it ſhould expreſſe them it ſelf, which it does not; And yet in the confidence of this Negative Argument, he is ready to cry <hi>victoria,</hi> pag. 11. where having cited the words of the Act of Settlement, he triumphs thus, <hi>Is there in all this one word of tending to ground-tranſplantation upon principles of puniſhment?</hi> Juſt as if I ſhould argue, Is there in all this one word of reaſon given for Tranſplantation (as indeed there is not) therefore Authority had not one reaſon for their action? Or as if I ſhould ſay, there is ſcarcely a line of ſenſe in Col. <hi>Laurences</hi> Book, from whence another ſhould collect, there is ſcarce any ſenſe in Col. <hi>Laurence?</hi> What a deſperate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion would this be? But, 2. Though it was not expreſt that it was their reaſon, yet he could not tell that it was not; for as they do not affirm it, ſo they do not deny it; they might diſcloſe ſome of their reaſons, and conceal others. 3. I would know if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had not thus treſpaſſed, whether they ſhould have been tranſplanted? If he ſay, No (as he muſt and does, <hi>Pag.</hi> 11.) then their Tranſplantation was the effect of their Rebellion; and what is puniſhment but the effect of ſinne? But he ſaith, it was to preſerve the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and might it not be for to puniſh the <hi>Iriſh</hi> too? May not one cauſe have many effects? Were not the <hi>Engliſh</hi> preſerv'd by the ſlaughter of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and yet they puniſht for their Rebellion too? O won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull acuteneſſe of judgement, that can thus divide a hair, that can oppoſe things ſubordinate, nay inſeparable! For could the <hi>Engliſh</hi> be ſafe without the puniſhment of the <hi>Iriſh?</hi> Why then was not ſo much bloud and treaſure ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? Am I now miſtaken? Or am I not rather taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe?</p>
            <p>7. After all this buſtling, which was onely to ſhew his ſtrength, and that he will be compell'd to nothing; yet to ſhew he is maſter of good nature to, and can be flexible, he meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſigns up the Concluſion at the foot of <hi>Pag.</hi> 11. admitting this in ſome degree to be done upon the account of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; But his inducement is remarkable, <hi>For the further
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:116738:19"/>
clearing up the Juſtice and Rationality of this work</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Tranſplantation, admit,</hi> &amp;c. He confeſſes he cannot fully clear up the Juſtice and Rationality of this work without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it to have been done on a principle of puniſhment; and yet was diſpleaſed with my ſaying it was done on this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that is, becauſe I did not ſay, this work was unjuſt and irrational; And now in meer compaſſion to my credit, and his own eaſe, he reſolves to diſcover no more of my miſtakes; I would he would be equally courteous to himſelf, and diſcover no more of his own neither.</p>
            <p>But now, <hi>Tam Marti, quam Mercurio;</hi> The Hiſtorian throws away his Gown, and the Collonel draws his Sword; he is Polemical as well as Practical. Like a Plaintane leaf, as he heals on one ſide, ſo he draws on t'other; as he has ſmiles for his favourites, ſo he has frowns for his enemies: Among whom he has the greateſt Antipathy againſt the Author of the Caſe of Tranſplantation (that is) anger, of which there can be aſſigned no reaſon.</p>
            <p>With whom he is reſolved to diſpute <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> 1. Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing his Arguments againſt me. And ſecondly, Reſolving to anſwer moſt of my ſwaying Reaſons, that is, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thoſe, that he can beſt make anſwer to, and are leaſt ſwaying.</p>
            <p>In the purſuing this deſign of his, I muſt here premiſe this one thing; that I do not condemn Authority, but acquit my felf; that I am not oppoſing what they ſhall do, but main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining what I have formerly ſaid; that I cenſure not their actions, (which are good) but Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi>'s Reaſon's, which are bad; That though Tranſplantation be fit to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in, yet doubtles they do it on better grounds and reaſons then thoſe maimed ones that he produces for them; 'tis him, not them I diſpute againſt.</p>
            <p>That he may do the firſt, he is feign to beg my lately ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed principle, That this Tranſplantation was grounded on puniſhment, which now it ſerves his turn, he tricks very fine and gay, and enlarges its Baſe at <hi>pag.</hi> 12. and 13. of his Treatiſe, that ſo it may uphold the figure of Tranſplantation to be ſet on it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:116738:20"/>
But his Order is full of very fine confuſion and mazes; it is ſport to ſee how he is loſt in his own labyrinth; I will but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat his own words; at the end of <hi>Pag.</hi> 11. there are five or ſix lines of moſt incomprehenſible Seraphical ſenſe; Thus they enter, <hi>For the further cleaning up the Juſtice and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionality of this work, admit it in ſome degree to have been done upon the account of puniſhment, which in a ſenſe may be admitted, for had they never offended, they had never been liable thereto; Therefore conſider what puniſhment it was they did incurre by their offence, which will be the better done, 1. by,</hi> &amp;c. Is not here a fine civil wilderneſſe with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite art contrived, for a man to loſe himſelf thus many times in poor five lines, as you ſhall ſee.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Here's <hi>Peleon</hi> tumbled upon <hi>Oſſa;</hi> All the degrees of compariſon jumbled together; he will clear up the Juſtice and Rationality of this work, which that he may do, he will admit it to have been done on the account of puniſhment; which that he may do, he will enquire what puniſhment it was they incurr'd; which that he may do, he will conſider firſt the offence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Cannot a ready Maſter now cut out pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently work enough for nine Journeymen? Why here's a circuit taken in, as if the <hi>Pyramides</hi> were to be reedified, Riſe up Tranſplantation, and go to your Conſideration, for your Conſiderations Conſideration has a Conſideration: O for a Midwife! What a thing it is for a man to have a coſtive brain; But</p>
            <p>Secondly, As we have ſeen this Maſterpiece of Art ſhew ſo well together, ſo no leſſe curioſity is in every limb, if you view it aſunder.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He admits the Tranſplantation in ſome degree to be done on the account of puniſhment; Pray to what is in <hi>(ſome degree)</hi> referred, to Tranſplantation? There are no degrees in that, it is a continued act, and of one kinde: unto <hi>(To be done)</hi> the action I hope will be perfect, and not admit degrees; <hi>To puniſhment,</hi> it is very remote from that; beſides, are there future ſufferings propheſied (beſides it ſelf) which is ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of puniſhment, but not all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Having thus begun his ſentence, and brought it, to a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:116738:20"/>
Colon, he makes one Parentheſis ride in the neck of another <hi>(which in a ſenſe may be admitted) (for had they never offended, they had never been liable thereto)</hi> and ſo ſweetly and moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodiouſly concludes the Period. Did ever two Parentheſis's finiſh a ſentence before? This is juſt like a horſe, that (running full ſpeed) ſtops on a ſudden, and throws his rider over his neck.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>conſider what puniſhment it was they did incurre by their offence; Wherefore? What did juſt now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede? Becauſe if they had never offended, they had never been liable thereto; Therefore conſider what puniſhment they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre by their offence;</hi> And very good reaſon too; an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent connexion! Juſt like ſuch an introduction as this, becauſe if the Angels never had ſinned, they had never fallen, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us conſider the Nature of Hell: A ſublime Preface! O that the Maſters of Rhetorique wanted ſo fine a Platform to commend to their boyes for the patern of an <hi>Exordium;</hi> Me thinks a ſpeech would begin moſt gracefully and heroically in ſuch a flow ſpondee pace as this; becauſe moſt noble hearers, if <hi>Paris</hi> had not taken <hi>Helen</hi> away from <hi>Menelaus, Hector</hi> had never been kill'd by <hi>Achilles;</hi> Therefore be pleas'd to hear the Tragedy of the warres of <hi>Troy;</hi> This is a Marriage between Eaſt and Weſt; Juſt as if this Gentleman ſhould deſire one to peruſe his late elaborate piece, for this reaſon, becauſe if I had not writ againſt Tranſplantation, he had not writ for it; Who will deſpair but that the Poles may meet and hang about one anothers neck, ſince they ſee as unlikely conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions?</p>
            <p n="4">4. To conſider their puniſhment, he muſt firſt conſider their offence; and after the firſt, the Reader will look for a ſecond; But his paſſionate Diſcourſe, quite drowned his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory: So that he forgets to introduce that ever after; though this were a fault in the literal ſenſe, yet it may be in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery 'tis not; which doubtleſſe was to ſhew, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence was ſo great, that there could be never another found to ſecond it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. After he has painted out their offence in good and true colours (to give every thing its due) he tels you not, but
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:116738:21"/>
leaves you to your own gueſſes concerning their puniſhment, though this Diſcourſe was begun for that end, tumbling again, <hi>Pag.</hi> 13. into the conſideration of Tranſplantation; this cannot it ſelf be the puniſhment he intended, 1. Becauſe he will hardly yield it a puniſhment: And ſecondly, were it one, it is not ſure commenſurate to the offence treated of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally; Of this Preface, I ſhall onely adde this one thing more, That as he very feelingly deplores the ſufferings of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> dead, ſo that he would exerciſe ſome of his compaſſion towards thoſe that are living, is my deſire, and may it be his practice; God will require it, if any ſhall ſo farre mock him, as to puniſh the <hi>Iriſh</hi> for being cruel to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be ſo too; There were Phariſees that abhorr'd their fathers killing the Prophets in old time, and yet themſelves ſlew them in their own time; What mean thoſe words, that the old Proteſtants are as bad, nay worſe then the <hi>Iriſh?</hi> yet they are too common in the mouths of ſome in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus, if from good beginnings we may flatter our ſelves with a fair iſſue, then ſure Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> may not deſpair, who in five lines has fallen but five times, as he was entring on what was material; But it may be he does this as a Souldier like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, who having now drawn down his Artillery to play on me, threw up this blinde work before, for their ſecurity.</p>
            <p>But now, Arm, Arm; The Alarm is given, the enemy is near; <hi>Long lookt for comes at length;</hi> now near half of his book is done, he will prove (that which he ſhould have done at the beginning) that the Tranſplantation is neceſſary; for which end he produces but a brace of Reaſons, <hi>Pag.</hi> 13. 1. It is the moſt probable means to ſecure the preſent <hi>Engliſh</hi> intereſt. 2. To maintain one for the future without charging <hi>England</hi> either in men or money.</p>
            <p>To prove the firſt, His Argument runs thus, That which was the ruine of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> chiefly in the laſt Rebellion, ought for the future to be avoided: But the living mixedly with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> was ſo; on the ſhewing of which he dilates, <hi>Pag.</hi> 14, 15, 16. Therefore they ought now to be ſeparated. To which I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:116738:21"/>
1. That I do anſwer, and not call his Argument an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency (which doubtleſſe I might) as he does mine, ſo in ſafety to eſcape him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That here he fights againſt no enemy (at leaſt of me) for I was not againſt a particular Tranſplantation (rightly ordered) though it may be I thought it not ſo abſolutely neceſſary; my whole Book runs againſt, what the Order ran far, A general Tranſplantation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But yet I think the reaſon on which he affirms it, weak, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That the mixtion of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was the cauſe; and ſecondly, though it was a cauſe heretofore, that it ſhould be a cauſe now, is a <hi>non ſequitur:</hi> For the firſt conſider,</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is irrational, That the ſcattering of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> among the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was the cauſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ruine; for whileſt they continued ſcattered, they wrong'd them not, but when they became imbodied, they did the miſchief; which is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign this Gentleman purſues; and therefore provides doubti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſafety, from that which was the cauſe of their deſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it was their numbers and power which was the cauſe, and the cohabitation with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> gave them oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to make uſe of theſe by way of ſurprize, which tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted they cannot do, <hi>p.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is not prevented by the Method which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent propounds neither; hear himſelf ſpeak, <hi>pag. 17. lin.</hi> 19. The Proprietors, and all relating to them, cannot be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally judged to be <hi>(near)</hi> the twentieth part of the people of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and there are none to go beſides (according to him) but thoſe that have been in arms; More then 19 parts then of the people are to remain among us, and cohabit with the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> there's no great danger of them; but if the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth ſtay, we are all undone: Look to <hi>lin.</hi> 29. of <hi>pag.</hi> 17. and he puts it out of all queſtion, where he muſters all to be (in his opinion) tranſplanted, both Proprietors and men in arms, and his rolls give us this account of them; any man that knows (ſayes he) the ſtate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> muſt acknowledge they <hi>(i. e.)</hi> all to be removed, are ſo inconſiderable, that hey will not be
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:116738:22"/>
miſſed or diſcerned as to the numbers in the Countreys from which they remove, further then one friend, may want ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Is not here great ingenuity, and rare wiſdom? Ingenuity, to tell you the <hi>Iriſh</hi> muſt be tranſplanted, becauſe mixing with them ruined the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and yet afterwards to tell you the number tranſplanted will not be ſo conſiderable as to be miſt. Prudence, to foreſee the cauſe of a miſchief, and to remove it by letting what produc't it remained ſtill: Yet theſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſolutions ſerved him in their proper ſtarions, the firſt to oppoſe me, That numbers in <hi>Ireland</hi> muſt be tranſplanted, leaſt they ruine the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for the time future: The ſecond, to mollifie the Reader, and take off his hard conceptions of Tranſplantation, that the number would be ſo inconſiderable, as could not be miſt. Indeed it was uncivilly done of me to be peeping further into a mans meaning then he expected, and unkindely to bring his witneſſes thus to confront one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther face to face, which he as little deſired.</p>
            <p>2. But on the contrary, Cohabiting with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> was a means probably to have quaſht the Rebellion, if other whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome concurrents (appointed by Law) had been duly executed; as, 1. Care taken for ſpreading the Proteſtant Religion, the neglect of which left them to their own, the ſtrongeſt incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to Rebellion, and tie to unanimity in it, and this would do well to be heeded for the time to come, which would work a change in their mindes, for changing of place will never make them honeſt. 2. Educating their Gentry in Civility and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, for which the Court of Wards was erected, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe was then convenient there for that Nation. 3. Suppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Language, Manners, Laws, Septs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Many more are obſerved by Hiſtorians. Theſe and ſuch like things negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, next (the provocation of the Divine Majeſty by the ſins of the <hi>Engliſh)</hi> were the cauſes of that horrid bloudy Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and not their dwelling among <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which if helpt with the aſſiſtance of ſuch proviſions as the Law did make, might probably have produced the contrary; that I am not ſingular in my opinion, but the Gentleman in his: Hear our Hiſtorians themſelves, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Joh. Davis,</hi> of the cauſes of former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:116738:22"/>
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> 1. The intollerable oppreſſion of the Armies <hi>(p.</hi> 28.) 2. Too large proportions of Land given to the Souldiers, though they warred at their own charge <hi>(p.</hi> 133.) contrary to the practice of other Generals, as <hi>Scipio, Pompey, Caeſar (pag.</hi> 156.) 3. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſeating themſelves in the rich plains, and driving the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to mountains and barren Lands <hi>(pag.</hi> 160.) 4. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> being together, making their conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies undiſcoverable <hi>(pag.</hi> 161.) 5. Their cohabitation gave them power to riſe <hi>(pag.</hi> 173.) 6. A diſcretionary way of governing them, more martial then civil <hi>(p.</hi> 253.)</p>
            <p>3. Though this ſhould in likelihood prevent ſurprizes to come, and that Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> ſhould not be taken nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, yet it prevents not Rebellion, and ſo is too narrow a plaiſter to cover the ſore of <hi>Ireland;</hi> nay it ſeemed to me to lay the ſeeds of an everlaſting feud, 1. By perpetuating the diſtinctions of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> Proteſtant and Papiſt. 2. By joyning <hi>Iriſh</hi> forces, to make them conſiderable. 3. By ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtring them, to give them the advantage of privacy in all their conſpiracies.</p>
            <p>4. If he had nothing but ſafety before his eyes, without either conſidering any thing elſe (which I believe was farre from Authority) then he might have thought on a ſafen way yet, which was to knock them all on the head, that will make them ſure, and us ſafe for certain.</p>
            <p>5. If we will believe thoſe that write the Hiſtory of <hi>Ireland,</hi> they tell us, this Gentlemans remedy of ſevering the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> wholly, wrought not that ſafety for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> which he fore-tels; the account they give of it, is; In the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were wholly ſubdued, and all or the greateſt part of them, ſaith <hi>Spencer,</hi> ſhut out by the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour into the mountain part of the Land; but in the Diviſion of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> the great <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men repaired to the aſſiſtance of their friends, which advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage the baniſht <hi>Iriſh</hi> taking, came down, and vanquiſhing the remaining <hi>Engliſh,</hi> repoſſeſt themſelves of the Land again: we cannot alwayes promiſe our ſelves the guard of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, of which we ſee ſome are drawn into <hi>England</hi> already, nor aſſure our ſelves againſt ſuch changes as have been.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:116738:23"/>
His inſtance of the Britiſh preſervation of themſelves by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imbodied, is <hi>Cauſa pro non cauſa,</hi> and a falſe allegation of Story beſides: For, 1. It aroſe not from thence, but from the diſſimulation of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who fearing to deal with both parties, gave out at firſt, that their quarrel was only againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whom whilſt they were worrying, the others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived their own preſervation.</p>
            <p>2. Sir <hi>John Davis</hi> ſayes expreſly, that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> was a mixt Plantation of Britiſh and Iriſh.</p>
            <p>3. What he ſayes of fact is falſe too, for 100000 were murther'd in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> in three dayes, and this he cals preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>6. Yet this does not conclude ſo great a neceſſity of this courſe as he layes upon it; that it is eſſential to their ſafety, as neceſſary as the ſtopping a leak in a ſhip to its preſervation (that is, without which it cannot be) for the bare compaſſing his end by this, does not exclude the attainment of it by other means; Now it may be, all the conſiderations in the world that conduce to ſafety, may not one time come into his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, if ſome of them be not above his underſtanding: But I am ſure he has not been pleaſed to think one of them worth the mention, and ſo they cannot be juſtly condemned before they are heard: The ſafety of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> may be compaſſed by the tranſplanting of the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> Therefore by no other way, is juſt ſuch an Argument as this, <hi>Richard Laurence</hi> is a Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel in <hi>Ireland;</hi> Therefore there's never another Collonel but he: I am ſure the Argument is as pitifull, as that Land would be, if it were ſo; Our old doting Anceſtours thought Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion one of theſe wayes; Where had been our Empire (ſayes <hi>Seneca)</hi> if wholſom Providence had not mixed the conquered with the Conquerours? And <hi>Livy,</hi> The State of <hi>Rome</hi> was advanc't by receiving their enemies into them.</p>
            <p>But I muſt proceed to the other head I propoſed, which was to ſhew the <hi>infirmnes</hi> of his conſequence (as well as the errour of his Propoſition) That though the <hi>Iriſh</hi> mixing with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were the cauſe of their eaſie perpetrating their bloudy reſolutions, yet there is no ſuch danger of the like in time to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:116738:23"/>
come, and ſo his reaſon is no reaſon; this will appear by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how the caſe is changed with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> from what it was then, in a double reſpect.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, Their inability to do us harm; they were ſtrong, they are weak; they were numerous, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by Sword, Peſtilence and Famine; they were hearty, they are out of courage; they were rich, they are poor and beggarly; they had Souldiers, they are left naked; they had Cities, ſtrong-holds, they have now but cottages to put their heads in; they had civil power, they have loſt it; they had Prieſts to harden them, they are baniſhed; the Tables are juſt turned; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are what the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were; rich, high, powerfull, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were, poor, few, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> never had ſo great a ſtrength in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſince the conqueſt of it, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> never ſo ſmall; now the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are changed, mens expectations may be likewiſe; What can they do? What may not they be made ſuffer? What fear is left for us, or hopes for them? Our condition is not ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, as that we need run to extreams to guard it; we may ſafely taſte the good of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> without fearing the ill; they have more reaſon now to fear ns, then we had to fear them.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, Advantages we have of doing them good; they are few, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> many; we may overſpread them, and incorporate them into our ſelves, and ſo by an oneneſſe take away the foundation of difference and fear together; we may breed up their youth, habituate them to our cuſtoms, cauſe a diſuſe of their Language: we have opportunities of communicating better things unto them, and probabilities they may be received, the Prieſts being gone that did harden, and affliction on them which may ſoften: I had no temptation to ſay theſe things, other then proceeded from a prompting reaſon, and a convinced conſcience; I have loſt as good an eſtate almoſt, as Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> has got by them; They could neither ſerve me by their power or riches: The Lord knows I ſpoke only from the bowels of a man towards men, and the charity of a Chriſtian to miſerable blinded Chriſtians, and one who had read a little what has happened to others
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:116738:24"/>
by this practice, and therefore would that we ſhould avoid their rocks: My end was good, if I had been miſtaken in the means.</p>
            <p>If I had thought it would have brought the leaſt damage upon the intereſt in <hi>England,</hi> I would have abhorr'd what I writ with my heart, and burrt it with my own hand: But if Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> and I were not of one judgement, I know no reaſon but we might have preſerved one affection.</p>
            <p>I expected now to have untied his ſecond Argument he propoſed for Tranſplantation, <hi>viz.</hi> from the future intereſt of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but either he had a horrible treacherous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, (and 'twas a ſtrange careleſneſſe, that having but two Arguments in a Cauſe, wherein he is ſo violent, and was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed with above twenty, he ſhould loſe one of them by the way) or a great obſtinacy, that he will neither ſhew his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, nor change his minde: Well it ſeems (though I finde him a bitter enemy, yet) he can be as good a friend, for he never forſakes where he once takes; if he carry not a cauſe 'tis not his fault but his evidences (whom he has ſummon'd) but they refuſe to appear; he will not forſake his one truſty Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was faithfull to him when all the reſt forſook him, but in his great humility marches up (though a Collonel) but with one after him, which is a command too ſmall for a Corporal.</p>
            <p>Well, having offered his ſervice to his cauſe, with this one Melancholy ſtray Argument, <hi>pag.</hi> 17. ſcorning to tread all rodes and beaten paths, he findes out a new way of reaſoning, altogether unknown either in the Schools or at the Bar; for they, fond men as they are (which of it ſelf is a ſufficient quarrel againſt Univerſities and Innes of Court) firſt tell you a long tale, which they call opening the Caſe, or ſtating the Queſtion, and then they offer their Reaſons, or (as they call them) Arguments for or againſt; But he skirmiſhes with his ſingle Argument firſt, and then after begins to ſtate the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: Juſt as if Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> ſhould in a quarrel draw his Sword, and then looking about him, ask, what's the matter? Or as if a man ſhould aim at nothing, or go to no place, or a dog ſhould hunt no game; or laſtly, an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:116738:24"/>
(as his does) conclude nothing; but it was but one, and not very conſiderable, he may hazard it as he pleaſe, for the loſſe cannot be great.</p>
            <p>Yet let us do our ſelves ſo great a courteſie, as to hear him reade his <hi>Theſis,</hi> and firſt his diſtinctions are many, ſharp and new.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion is confined (ſayes he) to the extent and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that's ſharp; by extent he means perſons (as you may ſee) and by manner time and place, as if time and place can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be extended, and perſons could be tranſplanted, and it be done in no manner; his branches are appoſite, but not oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite: 2. Confined to extent, it is univerſal or partial: This is new; to be confined to a univerſality: 'Tis juſt as if a man were a priſoner to the Univerſe. 3. Partial Tranſplantation is two-fold, 1. What part. 2. Which part: This is high again, ſo high, I confeſſe, that I am not able to reach the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I wonder if himſelf can finde a difference between what part, or which part.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I would fain know, what's the meaning of his asking Queſtions, and diſputing now? If the manner be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on, 'tis paſt diſpute; If it be ſtill diſputable, why has he ſo often aſſerted, that Authority reſolved on ſuch a particular Tranſplantation? Even in this very page he ſayes, 'tis out of queſtion, and yet daſhes it with a <hi>proviſo:</hi> So farre as I or he know, who are not acquainted with the myſteries of State; What does the State publiſh one thing, and intend ſecretly another? This is a myſtery indeed; yet this Gentleman takes the boldneſſe to publiſh it: But I will not too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, So farre as I or he knows, who (he addes) are but private men; If he knew the Author of the Caſe of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation, then he knew whom he ſo often called Malignant, Incendiary, and ſo muſt know himſelf miſtaken; if he did not, why does he here ſo poſitively ſay, he is but a private man?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If Authority have reſolved on the manner, how comes he to offer his opinion here? If they have, 'tis need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; If not, why was it ſo criminal in the Author of that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:116738:25"/>
Caſe, to offer his? How comes the ſame thing to be a virtue in the Reſpondent, and a vice in me?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, He ſayes, 'tis diſputable whether all ſhall remove at one time; it ſeems then, that though a part only be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted now, yet the reſidue may happen to follow hereafter; and ſo he contradicts himſelf, who ſayes elſwhere, <hi>A general Tranſplantation is reſolved againſt;</hi> and ſo I had reaſon to write againſt general Tranſplantation, which may happen (it ſeems) if not at this time, yet at ſome other.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, He is unſatisfied with the Orders of Authority, as well as he thinks I am; for if I doubted of the exceſſe, he ſcruples at the defect; he judges a leſſe number then what is intended is not ſafe (if ſo little.) Nay, in another place, it is not ſafe to let above the fifth part ſtay, and yet, he ſayes, it is reſolved, that not above the twentieth part ſhall go; From whence the reſult will be this eaſie Concluſion, that Authority have given out Orders, which in Col. <hi>Laurences</hi> judgement are not ſafe.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, He contradicts himſelf again, when in <hi>Pag.</hi> 17. (he ſayes,) The twentieth part of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are not to remove; and yet (ſo near as <hi>Pag.</hi> 16.) ſayes, It is not ſafe to admit above the fifth part of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts to ſtay.</p>
            <p>But ſince he is able to ſay nothing for himſelf, he is reſolved to anſwer what can be ſaid againſt himſelf; To which purpoſe he propounds four Objections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. That putting them together, may inable them to make a war.</p>
            <p>He anſwers, <hi>Pag.</hi> 18. Firſt, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are not afraid of Armies, but Tories; But I reply, That is not the Queſtion, Whether the <hi>Engliſh</hi> fear them? But whether it would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to warre, to put them all together? He ſaid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> imbodied need not fear the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and why ſhould the <hi>Iriſh</hi> imbodied fear the <hi>Engliſh?</hi> Does U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſtrengthen one, and weaken t'other?</p>
            <p>2. He anſwers, That united they will require leſſe forces to ſubdue them, then turning Tories to purſue them; I reply,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:116738:25"/>
1. Either they have a minde to turn Tories or not; if they have, then beſides our forces to defend <hi>Connaught,</hi> we muſt have others to attend the Tories out of it, and ſo the charge will not be leſſened but doubled; if they have not a minde to turn Tories, then an unneceſſary charge will be upheld ſtill, to attend them with an Army, leſt they ſhould raiſe a warre; Tranſplantation cannot hinder thoſe that will be Tories; Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranſplanting cannot further thoſe that would not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Does not this oppoſe all the reaſon in the world, that a power united ſhould require leſſe force to oppoſe it? Yet this is the Gentlemans paradox; We uſe to ſay, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited force is ſtrongeſt;</hi> and does that which is ſtrongeſt require only that which is weak to overcome it? <hi>Divide and reign,</hi> ſaid the ſeven Wiſe-men; but the eight, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite your enemies, if you would reign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. I would intreat this Gentleman to ſubmit the trial to ſenſe; Are a few ſparks of fire hardlier quencht then a flame? Is a bank againſt the Sea eaſier made then againſt a puddle? Is a river weaker in the unparted channel, then in the rivol<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

Let him try if he can break a faggot quicklier bound, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied; What ſhall we ſay to him, that bids battel to all the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks together? And yet he that cannot pretend to ſenſe, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to nibble at wit in the cloſe of this anſwer, <hi>Thus by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into a body</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>we play our game in</hi> Engliſh <hi>with them, but by leaving them diſperſed, we play our game in</hi> Iriſh <hi>with them;</hi> Playing in <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and playing in <hi>Engliſh;</hi> Do men uſe <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o play in games, or at games? You may know by his terms of Art, that he is but a bungler, and that if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had not met with ſhreuder gameſters then himſelf, they had never in likelihood been ſo ſoundly beaten, as they have been.</p>
            <p>2. The next Objection he anſwers, is only theſe two words of mine ('Tis ſtrange) he names the Tories indeed, but having devoured them in the laſt, he will not chew the cud in this, <hi>Pag.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis ſtrange! ſo 'tis indeed a ſtrange Objection, Who made it? He aſſails a poor Parentheſis in its trenches, O valiant, the Fortification about it was not able to reſiſt him!
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:116738:26"/>
But he relinquiſhes the Objection that it will make Tories: It ſeems the Collonel likes not that ſport: that's above his ſtrength; nor ſayes a word to the Objection, that's above his reaſon: So I have ſeen a young Spaniel ſolemnly purſuing his game with the reſt of the dogs, when on a ſudden, a Bird ſpringing out of a buſh diverts him from the company, and he runs barking and ſtaring after that: If the Tories do riſe, who can help it? let others look to that: he's reſolved to run down the poor parentheſis.</p>
            <p>3. But the Collonel foreſees his credit is ingaged, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore back again he turns, and will not let thoſe Tories go ſo; he will venture to ſpeak with them at leaſt; thus he ſhuffles and cuts, run backwards and forwards: this is neither good pace, nor good trot; Well, What ſayes he at length? What if they will not go but turn Tories? He anſwers to this <hi>pag.</hi> 20. that he ſhould be loath to force them, if it be impoſſible or hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous; but if from a rebellious ſpirit they refuſe, he judges it beſt to put it to the tryall, before the Army diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. He is kind, he will not force men upon impoſſibilities; but by his good leave I think he offers a little force to ſenſe; for if a man be forc't on't 'tis poſſible; if it be impoſſible, the force is ſo likewiſe.</p>
            <p>2. If it be a deſperate hazard, he will not force them; this is kinder yet, he deals as he would be dealt with; he loves not deſperate hazards.</p>
            <p>3. But the condition of this preſent Obligation is, That the above bounden <hi>Richard Laurence</hi> be convinc't of theſe things, otherwiſe this Act and Deed of his to be null, and of no force: This will I fear reſcind his former Conceſſions. There are but two wayes of convincing a man, by reaſon or experiment; the firſt has been uſed, and though he cannot anſwer it, yet he can reject it; I can adviſe him no other way then the ſecond; That he vouchſafe the perſons tranſplanted his company in a ſutable equipage to them, and that will better inform him of the hazards.</p>
            <p>4. But if they will turn Tories, he ſaith, 'tis beſt put it quickly to the tryal; His anſwer ought to have been, That
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:116738:26"/>
this is not a way to make them Tories: but it ſeems his reaſon can dictate no ſuch thing to him, and therefore he muſt try it before he can anſwer you; till when he grants the Concluſion. But <hi>Sir,</hi> ſome trials are dangerous (as if fire will burn) and ſuch things it is better to keep from tryal; you have forgot you ſaid before, that Tories have been ſo deſtructive to our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; now you will have our Army be as deſtructive to them; but yet I perceive you are wiſe for your ſelf; it is enough for you to give counſel, the executing of it as a Legacy you kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bequeath to others; the Army muſt try before more be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sbanded; But why may not Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> try it after, who fears not disbanding? No, the Ape will have coals out of the fire, but ſhe will pull them out with the Cats foot; This Gentleman is like a Cypher, joyned with an Army, he adds much to them, but take him by himſelf, and he ſignifies juſt nothing.</p>
            <p>5. In ſtead of anſwering, he wonders <hi>(pag.</hi> 20) that the buſineſſe of Tranſplantation ſhould engage them to a new war; ſo ſlight a thing, and yet <hi>pag.</hi> 19. he ſayes, It is not ſtrange that they ſhould reſent it more then death it ſelf, and gives many reaſons for it; Strange that they ſhould (fight) againſt it, and yet not ſtrange that they ſhould (die) againſt it: <hi>Apollo</hi> reconcile me theſe two; Thus 'tis done in a word, Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> had rather die then fight it ſeems.</p>
            <p>The Reſpondent affects confuſion as much in word as deed, and therefore has ſuffered two Objections to ſtraggle from their company, to the rear of his Book, <hi>Pag.</hi> 26. which I ſhall deſire to march up into their proper place, that ſo I may take a view of them with the reſt here, and the Reader ſee the whole ſtrength he muſters at one view.</p>
            <p>1. The laſt and great Objection (he ſayes) is the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Tranſplantation, which I prove not (he thinks) but impliedly, 1. In ſaying, they may have ſtill a dram of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious bloud left: And ſecondly, That the power and ſtrength of <hi>England</hi> is but a ſcare-crow, and Hat on a ſtick, fit to drive Geeſe; To the firſt he anſwers, it may ſhew it difficult, but not impoſſible, becauſe they can let that out;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:116738:27"/>
and for the ſecond, his Anſwer is to the ſame (or no) purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. I muſt take off the calumny the Reſpondent layes on me, That I reſemble the power of <hi>England</hi> to a ſcare-crow, or a Hat on a ſtick, fit to drive Geeſe; Is it not enough that he feigns me to abuſe Authority in <hi>Ireland?</hi> But he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell my words to an abuſe of the Authority of <hi>England:</hi> Strange ignorance never to underſtand me, or malice alwayes to pervert me! When will he leave wronging himſelf, for me he cannot? 1. Scare-crow is a word of his own foiſting in. 2. There is not a word ſpoken there (in that paſſage) of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, either in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland.</hi> To any perſon of an uncraz'd brain, my meaning was very obvious, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> would not go according to Orders, nor drive by force, for ſo that innocent Proverb only ſignifies, and is as harmleſſe as thoſe creatures I uſed in the compariſon: I have too high an eſteem of the Army to give them ſuch language, I know their worth, and the greatneſſe of their actions and ſufferings in <hi>Ireland;</hi> of which I wiſh they may be near an end, to enjoy rewards proportionable to their very great deſerts.</p>
            <p>2. He had no reaſon to be offended that I did ſuppoſe a dram of rebellious bloud to lie ſtill in the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> I would there were no more: But he is hard to be pleaſed; if I ſpeak chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably of them, then I am a friend to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and if I ſpeak ill of them, then I am an enemy to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and incite the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to rebell; and as he uſes me, juſt ſo he does them: For when he muſt juſtifie Tranſplantation, then they are the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedeſt people in the world; but at another time pretty honeſt. There are two paſſages which brought together make him a good Advocate for the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> pag. 11. of his Book, he ſayes, <hi>All Perſons that had contrived, adviſed, promoted, aſſiſted, or abetted the Rebellion, muſt tranſplant:</hi> yet <hi>Pag.</hi> 19. he ſayes, <hi>Thoſe to go will hardly be miſt being not near the twentieth part of the people (beſides Souldiers.)</hi> Now ſurely we have done the good honeſt people wrong all this while, for we ſlandered them, as if few of them were honeſt; and it ſeems not above the twentieth part were otherwiſe; well but all their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty ſhall not ſave them from going to <hi>Connaught,</hi> and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:116738:27"/>
ſo he makes us amends for the commendations he gave them.</p>
            <p>3. I ſaid, 'tis impoſſible to make them go if they would not; To which he anſwers, 'Tis not impoſſible, for he can let out this dram of Rebellious bloud in them: What then? And will that make them go, or not? They will not go when they are alive, and can they go after they are dead? He cannot make them when 'tis poſſible, but he will make them go when 'tis impoſſible. He does ill ſure! This is the third time (as I remember) that he has frightned us with theſe Stories of dead folks walking.</p>
            <p>4. Did not I prove this (and he approves it likewiſe) when I ſhew'd they abhor'd this more then death it ſelf; Can you compell a man to an act that prefers death before it? Compell him before you cannot, he will die or you can but kill him, compell him after you cannot, he is dead.</p>
            <p>I have given a ſingle Anſwer to both his, becauſe they ſhrink into one likewiſe, and for his making me the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rager of a ſecond Rebellion, I think that worth none; like a Hedge-hog 'tis his nature to roll up and down, and to prick.</p>
            <p>You might imagine that I had now put in my final Anſwer, having untied his to the laſt, and great Objection, as he terms it; but he that (you may remember) before makes a firſt without a ſecond, findes out ſomething here after the laſt, which is this; It may be objected, he ſayes, that yet this Tranſplantation will be the deſtruction of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation, having nothing to ſubſiſt on, either in their journey, or when they come thither. This he anſwers, 1. With examples of tranſplanting in others.</p>
            <p>2. With the tender care of Authority for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in this, <hi>Pag.</hi> 27, 28. To the firſt Anſwer I reply,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the Reſpondent had pleaſed he might have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of my proofs, where I lay down this Propoſition, but thoſe had fore-ſtall'd his Anſwer; he loves to uſe bare affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations himſelf without proof; and if others will not do ſo too, it had been as good they would; for he'll deny their Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, but not trouble himſelf to anſwer their Arguments.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:116738:28"/>
2. Unleſſe it were (upon ſo fair an occaſion offered) to give us an account of his reading in Hiſtory, he need not have travell'd ſo farre for examples to confute me withall, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this by his own example, ſince he could not by his reaſon; Might he not too have oppreſt us with inſtances of all ſorts, whereas he only culs a few that are ſelect? Do not flowers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their loſt colours by removing? Fruits and berries come to their gratefull taſte: Is not Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> fortune much bettered, ſince he was tranſplanted? And does not <hi>change of paſtures make fat—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Is the Gentleman in jeſt or ſerious? If the firſt, and it be only to ſhew his wit, he maintains paradoxes, good leave have he, ſince theſe occaſions return not often upon him; But if he does not ſhew his wit in it (as I believe indeed he does not much) then I wonder how he could be deceived himſelf, or deceive others with ſuch examples as he produces, which do as much illuſtrate the things they are brought for to prove, as a dark Lanthorn does the Candle that is in it; nay are ſo extreamly different, as light and darkneſſe are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd further aſunder; View but theſe few parallels, and that will ſhew their agreement: 1. Sayes he, <hi>The</hi> Engliſh <hi>are to remove into</hi> Ireland, <hi>the</hi> Engliſh, Dutch, French <hi>have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted themſelves into</hi> America; <hi>which are greater journeys, then from one part of</hi> Ireland <hi>to another, yet theſe were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by it, thoſe we hope will not be:</hi> This indeed has a ſhadow of reaſon to ſtrangers, but cannot delude thoſe that look tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into it. For</p>
            <p>1. Does he make no difference between thoſe that go out of a place, and thoſe that are driven out (as the <hi>Iriſh)</hi> between thoſe that hope for gain by it, as thoſe Nations, and thoſe that receive puniſhment in it (which is the <hi>Iriſh</hi> condition) why does he not let the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſtay till the ſame invitations that drew other Nations to tranſplant, invite them alſo? Did he not confeſſe heretofore, That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were as willing to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace death as going into <hi>Connaught?</hi> and proves, that they had good reaſon ſo to do: yet here (having forgot what he ſaid there, and it being for his behoof to ſay the contrary) he ſcruples not at the contradiction, but would make you believe,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:116738:28"/>
That Tranſplantation is ſo facil a thing, that 'tis but like going out of <hi>England</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> nay leſſe; Thus occaſion is the winde, and his invention the ſail, and as that veres, ſo he hands and ſhifts this without any dread at all of doing violence to truth, or injury to his Reader; going is but going with him, 'tis no matter how or where.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, Thoſe Nations that tranſplanted themſelves into forreign parts, did not thereby loſe thoſe Eſtates they left behinde them, but get thoſe they found before them, nor change one for another, but adde one to another: Do the <hi>Iriſh</hi> thus?</p>
            <p>3. They had all neceſſary proviſions and accommodations along with them, elſe they might have refuſed to have gone, but the <hi>Iriſh</hi> muſt go, whether they have them or not; Does not this make a difference?</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> that made forreign Tranſplanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were rich and full of treaſure, commencing their actions either on their Kings account, or the ſtocks of united Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, ſo to improve their new poſſeſſions; but the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are beggars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an und one people, they have nothing to begin with; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that are to come are men that have bought Eſtates, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> that go are men that have ſold or forfeited them: Does not this vary the caſe ſomewhat?</p>
            <p>5. Thoſe that you ſay tranſplanted themſelves, went into places where either none were to oppoſe them, or they had power (at leaſt as they conceived) to force their poſſeſſions: But the <hi>Iriſh</hi> go naked and unarmed to be ſetled upon other mens Lands, in <hi>Connaught;</hi> who (to their encouragement I believe the Collonel ſpeaks it, <hi>Pag.</hi> 19. of his Book) will bid them (he ſayes) ſuch welcome, as they will bid the Souldiers and Adventurers upon their Land.</p>
            <p>6. Thoſe Planters he ſpeaks of, went with a Commiſſion as large as their power could write for them, to take what they would, do what they could, but the <hi>Iriſh</hi> go with chains at their heels, as priſoners at large; when they are there, they muſt not on ſuch a penalty come near the Sea, or a Gariſon, or cut a ſtick of wood to build a houſe without particular licence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I write not this as if the Commonwealth injured them in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:116738:29"/>
putting ſuch conditions on them, but to ſhew the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel abuſes his Readers in producing ſuch compariſons to them.</p>
            <p>7. Theſe Planters did only ſubdue, not turn out the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons where they came; What would the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Indies be worth him elſe? The <hi>Romans</hi> mixed their Colonies with the Natives (ſayes <hi>Roſinus)</hi> nor did the <hi>Engliſh</hi> pale in <hi>Ireland</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate any of this practice (as his pitifull ignorance in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry makes him ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 26.) for <hi>Campion</hi> tels us, 'twas the <hi>Engliſh</hi> neceſſities not will made that diſtinction: His words are, <hi>When the Iriſh had raiſed tumults continually againſt the Engliſh planted here with the conqueſt: at laſt they courſed the Engliſh into a narrow circuit of ground, out of which they durſt not peep, whereupon it was called their pale:</hi> 'Tis wonder he did not tell us of a like deſign of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> for the <hi>French</hi> Hiſtory tels us, (but he wanders not ſo far I hope in his reading) <hi>That in the time of our</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, <hi>there was an Engliſh Pale in France, which reacht from the river</hi> Charent <hi>in</hi> Xantoirgue <hi>to the</hi> Pyrenaees; and yet I hope the <hi>French</hi> were not tranſplanted, but it ſhewed how farre the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, who would believe that a man in ſuch eminent place as Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> is, ſhould be ſo weak to hope to convince any body with ſuch childiſh Sophiſms as theſe? Therefore what he begins his Anſwer withall, <hi>pag.</hi> 27. That if this were the true ſtate of the Caſe, there were much in it; I ſhall conclude mine, ſince it appears that this is the truer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtate of the Caſe, by his own confeſſion it remains, that there is much in it; and ſo I paſſe to the ſecond branch of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which is</p>
            <p>2. The Authority in <hi>Ireland</hi> has a tenden regard of them; To which I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That his Excellency the preſent Lord Deputy in <hi>Ireland,</hi> has had a tender regard unto them, as he has unto all perſons, and of all actions; and 'twas well for the Natives he was there, for elſe I doubt the fingers of ſome had been heavier on them then his loins.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But yet he muſt exerciſe this kindeneſſe to them in what
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:116738:29"/>
he may, not in what he will, he muſt do according to orders, not his own intentions, unleſſe he have a ſecret unlimited power, which this Gentleman has taught me to ſay, he and I being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men are not in a capacity of knowing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The bending of Tranſplantation ſo hard on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> does not altogether ſo much reſt on the perſons that are to execute it, as on the nature of the thing it ſelf, and the perſons to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo it, and the place to which, and the condition how they muſt abide there: The Lord Deputy may make ſome alleviati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (and will I am ſure as many as he can) but cannot take off the burden; He may delay their going but not hinder it; he may (like a good Phyſician) give them ſome eaſe.</p>
            <p>And thus I have been patient to attend particularly upon all Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> hath ſaid that reſpects me in his Book, a ſhort Scheme of which I ſhall here offer to the Readers eye for the confirmation of his memory; He hath attempted to bring one Argument for Tranſplantation, and anſwer four Objections againſt it, and a poor Parentheſis; with what ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe the Reader may judge, if any ſhall be ſo much at leiſure, and will be ſo friendly as to hear the cauſe of this Difference; This <hi>Modicum</hi> is the meat he hath invited his friends to, the reſt are feathers to choke me, Railings, Threatnings, Falſities, Miſtakes, and Self-contradictions; Theſe ſwell the Volume<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> elſe his <hi>Iliads</hi> might have been put into a Nutſhell; Theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of mine he throws by as impertinencies; ſome drawn from Religion, ſome for profit, and ſome for ſafety, which branch into above twenty ſeveral heads; If he have ſatisfied himſelf with this kinde of dealing, I believe he has not others, I am ſure he has not me; his friends may cling to his perſon, mine to me, but perſons unintereſted in both, or intereſted in the Tranſplantation will be ſwayed by reaſon, and will not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied without it.</p>
            <p>But the thing is now beyond conſideration, being put into action; which I ſhall ſubmit unto as freely as Collonel <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;</hi> and what I here write is not to condem it, but to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my ſelf. States and Governours have grounds and reaſons for their actions better then, and above ordinary comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; ſuch I doubt not theirs are that eſtabliſh this, which as
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:116738:30"/>
they are not bound to give an account to any of, ſo 'twere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence to demand it, and impudence not to obey them; I binde up my reaſon in theirs, and ſhall condemn my own ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then theirs; I wiſh them all happineſſe in this, as well as their other Counſels, and doubt not but to finde from them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reception, or at leaſt a milder interpretation of that which was aim'd only at their ſervice, then from Collonel <hi>Laurence,</hi> if I happened to tranſgreſſe in ſome particulars through frailty, not malice.</p>
            <p>Beſides, that Authority as it is more benign and powerfull then commonly private perſons are, ſo there are two things I here preſent them that may invite them to it:</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that when that firſt Paper of Tranſplantation was penned by me, it was intended not in oppoſition, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in ſubordination to the pleaſures of his Excellency the Lord Deputy, and Councel of <hi>Ireland,</hi> not by way of preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, but ſubmiſſion to their wiſdoms; nor in retrenchment of what they had done, but to be preſented to them for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and liking, in caſe they ſhould judge it expedient; It was not an appeal from, but to them, which in caſe it had been further conſidered of here in <hi>England,</hi> would have been remitted to them for their cenſure or approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, That that Paper being a draught only of Reaſons, and briefly, made ſome things to appear in a rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hue, then if attended with thoſe qualifications that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in that Book, and was ready to have preſented to the Parliament in caſe they had required them; which qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it was not ſeaſonable to publiſh with the Book it ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it might have given too timely a notice of what would have been acted by them: And after their Diſſolution it was too late, the thing being paſt all debate: But is not too late for me to alledge to manifeſt my own innocency, nor for his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency the Lord Deputy and Counſel to conſider of, to ſhew the juſt reſpect had by me to their Authority, however others have labour'd to ſuggeſt unto them the contrary; I ſuppoſe I have hitherto ſerved the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> above being now liable to the juſt cenſure of Malignity againſt them;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:116738:30"/>
and although my actions have not been ſo conſiderable, as my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf deſired they ſhould be; yet neither can I think they ought to be ſo ſlighted in compariſon of Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> and his Adherents, as if they were the only men, the pillars whoſe ſtrength upheld all: ſo I have ſeen at the entrance of ſome magnificent building, a carved antick groan with bowed ſhoulders, as if he ſuſtain'd the whole weight, as if he upheld the houſe, whereas the houſe upholds him; This I take to be their caſe.</p>
            <p>The reſt of his work (not yet taken notice of) is only a ſhort Catechiſm compoſed by him from <hi>pag.</hi> 20. to <hi>pag.</hi> 26. for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to learn as they travel unto <hi>Connaught,</hi> having little elſe to do, put (but not digeſted) into Queſtions and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers; or Caſes of Conſcience to ſatisfie the ſcruples of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who are ſomewhat troubled in minde at their being tranſplanted; where himſelf asking the Queſtions, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Anſwers, it may be thought he will be more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet then to poſe himſelf (whatever another robuſtiouſly may do:) And yet I have heard ſome young Novice conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, have raſhly rais'd ſpirits, which after they could not lay; and it may be this may be his caſe, I ſhall examine it, and (that he may not complain of any part of his Book being rejected, as impertinent, for he that had taken up that reſolution, had diſcarded the whole) ſet down ſome ſhort Obſervations on it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Why the Landlord muſt go, not the Tenant; He anſwers, he is not tranſplanted <hi>quâ</hi> Landlord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. He tels you of his not tranſplanting, when the Queſtion was moved of his tranſplanting.</p>
            <p>2. The Queſtion asks (why) he is tranſplanted; he anſwers (How) he is not; <hi>i. e. quâ</hi> Landlord.</p>
            <p>3. He anſwers, he is not tranſplanted <hi>quâ</hi> Landlord, but tels you not whether he be tranſplanted <hi>quâ</hi> Tenant, or <hi>quâ</hi> man, or <hi>quâ</hi> Rebell; Well though the <hi>quâ</hi> may be doubtfull, yet the beſt on't is, the tranſplanting will be certain.</p>
            <p>4. 'Tis ſtrange that he is not tranſplanted <hi>quâ</hi> Landlord, when moſt of the Landlords are to be tranſplanted; if it be a lot, the Dice runs ſhrewly againſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:116738:31"/>
5. They are not to be tranſplanted <hi>quâ</hi> Landlords, and yet the Tenants go not though they are men and Rebels as well as the Landlords; This is a likely ſtory.</p>
            <p>6. He forgets himſelf, for afterward <hi>p.</hi> 22. he there tels you the Reaſons why the Landlords go, they had more means, and more influence, and therefore are to be tranſplanted; and had they not this as they were Landlords? and as having this he grants they ſhall be tranſplanted, and yet denies they are as Landlords tranſplanted. He has a notable Metaphyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal head (it ſeems) thus to be able to abſtract things; if he were a Chymiſt he would either finde out the Philoſophers ſtone, or knock out his brains againſt it, he's ſo good at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
            <p>7. As a Landlord he is not to be tranſplanted: that is it may be, if he had not been a Rebel; and ſo he ſtarts a curious new notion, that all men that have Lands in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhall not go to <hi>Connaught;</hi> and that this is the ſubtilty he ſprings, his own words aſſure us <hi>pag. 22. lin.</hi> 21. It is not their having Land is the fault, but miſ-improving the ability it gave them.</p>
            <p>8. He goes not away as a Landlord; I am confident now I have hit on his ſenſe, and this is it; for he has loſt his eſtate by forfeiture before he goes, and ſo is none.</p>
            <p>His ſecond Queſtion, Whether the Tenants have not been equally guilty, and yet are not tranſplanted; and then this is with childe of another young queſtion; If this be not partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; To the firſt he anſwers nothing: To the ſecond, No.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. This queſtion ſeems to be to the former, like one of <hi>Hopkins</hi> or <hi>Sternholds</hi> Pſalms, Another of the ſame.</p>
            <p>2. Yet now I rub my eyes, methinks I ſpy a glimering dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; for his firſt queſtion was before, Why the Landlord ſhould be tranſplanted, and not the Tenant? But his ſecond is, Why the Tenant is not tranſplanted, but the Landlord? and between theſe two you know there's a vaſt difference; Juſt as much as was between Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> and the Marſhal-General, though not ſo much as between a horſe-mill, and a mill-horſe; though they are terms convertible.</p>
            <p>3. His ſecond Anſwer is true, if he can prove his ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That Tranſplantation is a free meer act of grace, but that's not true. For</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:116738:31"/>
1. He muſt remember that (before) he granted it (in ſome ſenſe) a puniſhment; and if ſo, 'twill then come to be (in ſome ſenſe) injuſtice, where an offence is equal to make the ſuffering unequal according to his own reſolution.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is this now an act of grace, which himſelf ſayes <hi>Pag.</hi> 19. the <hi>Iriſh</hi> have reaſon to accept of death rather? Is not this to make the State ridiculous, to tell men they hold forth great acts of grace to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> ſuch as they have reaſon rather to die then accept of?</p>
            <p>His third Queſtion; What are the Reaſons the Landlord is tranſplanted, not the Tenant?</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſpeak to this, 1. in general; and then, 2. in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to his Anſwers, which (as the Legion ſaid of himſelf) are many, and yet there was never a good one.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I obſerve this is the the third concoction of this queſtion, whereby you may perceive (though his Book ſhews his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack's very great) his digeſtion is not very good; What has an <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> met him, that he ſtrayes thus up and down? Nothing but the ſame queſtion? 'Tis a conjecturers circle, and he cannot get out on't. But it may be I have the myſtery on't; 'Tis a knotty queſtion this, and fit to be ſearch't into; But his invention is obſtinate, and will confeſſe nothing directly, and therefore he reſolves to circumvent her with multiplying and varying the forms of the ſame queſtion; It may be thus he may pump out ſomething out of her at length; Well howſoever, what he cannot furniſh you with in anſwers, he ſupplies in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He now anſwers what the Reaſons are of this act; and yet before he askt the ſame queſtion twice, and pretended to give anſwers; What's the reaſon of this act of his? Why you muſt underſtand that now he is come to his anſwers with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and thoſe before are his anſwers without reaſon. His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. The Landlords maintain'd the Rebels; Therefore merit to be tranſplanted moſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> And the Tenants maintained the Landlord, and the Rebels too; The firſt, Immediately, the ſecond, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:116738:32"/>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. The Landlords, maintaining the Army ſhould have had an equal ſhare in the booty; and to juſtifie this he brings Scripture to confirm the <hi>Iriſh</hi> dividing the goods after they had plundered the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But how know you they ſhould? Have the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Landlords that maintained the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army had an equal ſhare in the booty they got? Or are the Rebels acts which were lookt on as inhumane, now become ſacred, and parallel to <hi>Davids</hi> actings in the Scripture? The plundered <hi>Engliſh</hi> will hardly believe the Preacher that brings this Divinity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. It will break their Septs, which I confeſſe to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, <hi>Pag.</hi> 22. of the Caſe of Tranſplantation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I did, and do ſo ſtill, by which he may ſee I was for the good of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and therefore needed not have been in ſuch choler with me.</p>
            <p>2. Yet it does not infer his Concluſion; for the Septs will be broke if the Tenants be tranſplanted, and the Landlords ſtay.</p>
            <p>3. Yet are not the Septs broke by this, for only Proprietors going, their eldeſt ſons and other ſtay, who when their fathers die will ſtill head their Septs of parties.</p>
            <p>4. The Law has provided for this (without tranſplanting) <hi>An. 5. Ed.</hi> 4. as by taking ſirnames, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for breaking their dependencies, <hi>An. 11. Eliz.</hi> but this Gentleman ſtudies only martial Law.</p>
            <p>5. The Septs may be broke by removing the Landlords mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually out of their own into remoter Counties, which was the way of Tranſplantations our Hiſtorians ſpeak of, and former Stateſmen advis'd to.</p>
            <p>3. But if it be only this he intends to put in execution, I ſhall not quarrel with him. But how to ſalve this proceeding with publick Orders already given out, I confeſſe I know not; Thoſe being general, if I have either eyes or ears; and for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Orders (if there were any) they were only to be taken notice of, by thoſe to whom they were no ſecrets, and ſo could not by me; Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> then being reſolved to condeſcend to me in the thing, I ſhall not quarrel with him for differing from me in words; for what he knows I writ for him
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:116738:32"/>
before; And I am ſure he acts for me now, if his ſayings and doings differ not. Choler in him began the quarrel, or a worſe principle; neceſſity made me take it up; I muſt either ſubmit to thoſe crimes he charges me with, or by a reply diſcharge my ſelf; If he had uſed fewer ill words, he had not received ſo many; which though perhapsſharp, are neither ſcolding nor lies.</p>
            <p>If he had ſtayed to right Authority, till I had wronged them, he had never been an Apologiſt; nay, it may be he has wrong'd them more (in ſcribling ſo weakly for them) then another could in writing ſtrongly againſt them. If a conceited injury done to others made him thruſt himſelf into print, a reall one done me ſpeaks my excuſe: Let no poor ſufferer by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> betray his Reaſon or Religion to his paſſion here, to think no evils can be too great to be brought on the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> It was their being cruel makes thee hate them ſo much; to puniſh them, do no not run into their ſin, leaſt God puniſh thee; Do not think that he that writes this, and the Caſe of Tranſplantation pleads for them, but thy cauſe; 'Tis ſafe, profitable for thee, that ſome be removed, not all; This Collonel <hi>Laurence</hi> ſayes ſhall be done, this I deſired might be done; Where is my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt Authority more then his, my love to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> more then his, or my care of thee leſſe then his; I was far from being moved by them to do what I have done, but by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> intereſt, as I apprehended; I was by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale</hi> and <hi>Bandon</hi> choſen a Member of the laſt Parliament, and though their generoſity was ſuch, as by their own disburſments to offer to defray my journey for <hi>England,</hi> yet I accepted it not; 'tis unlikely the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſhould corrupt me, and 'tis a lie whoever ſhall ſay it, becauſe he wants ſomething elſe to ſay; But I have tired my ſelf to refute ſlanders, and am glad I ſhall now end.</p>
