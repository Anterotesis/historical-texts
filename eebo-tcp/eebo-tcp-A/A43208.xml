            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>This King took quiet poſſeſſion of the Throne, and had an interrupted Series of Tranquility for a time; but by degrees the diſtractions came on, that turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Land into a ſeat of War for many years: <hi>Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win de Redners</hi> was the firſt that openly began to declare himſelf in favour of the Empreſs <hi>Maud,</hi> and hereupon the <hi>Welſhmen</hi> took up Arms, and falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> not altogether provided, gave them a conſiderable overthrow: Nor did <hi>David,</hi> King of the <hi>Scots,</hi> forbear to invade this Kingdom; and the <hi>Weſh</hi> incouraged by their former ſucceſs, continued to ſpoil the Frontiers, and under the favour of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Invaſion, wherein, under the leading of their King, the <hi>Scots</hi> committed almoſt unparallel outrages.

But the <hi>Scots,</hi> inſtead of aſſiſting theſe Lords, making many other Invaſions, made great ſpoil and havock of their Houſes, Caſtles and Eſtates, ſeeming rather to aim at a conqueſt than any thing leſs: So that thoſe in the <hi>North</hi> marched againſt them, and being animated by <hi>Thurſtan,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> by whoſe Authority <hi>Ralph</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> being made General, undertook (but by what Warrant I

King <hi>Stephen</hi> thus made a Priſoner, was carried to <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> where the Empreſs expected him, and from thence ſent Priſoner to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> whereupon all but the County of <hi>Kent</hi> acknowledged her as their Soveraign, ſo that going to <hi>Wincheſter</hi> in ſtate, ſhe there received the Regal Crown, and paſſing to <hi>London,</hi> ſhe was met with Proceſſion, and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of the people, but the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> Brother to the Empreſs, being taken by ſome of the Nobles that ſided with King <hi>Stephen,</hi> and Impriſoned at <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> ſearing if any violent Death befel the King, he ſhould run the ſame Riſque, he ſo far ſolicited the matter, that an exchange was made, and both the one and the other had Liberty, after which the Earl went for <hi>Normandy,</hi> which had revolted from <hi>Stephen,</hi> to raiſe Forces to ſecure what was gained; but whilſt this was doing the <hi>Londoners</hi> being diſpleaſed, as not
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:46420:43"/>receiving the ſatisfaction they expected, and the Nobles thinking themſelves ſlighted by her, the reſtleſs Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> ſet the Nation again into a Blaze of diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, making a ſtrong Party for King <hi>Stephen,</hi> beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Empreſs in the Caſtle of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſter</hi> ſeven weeks, and then the better to work his advantage, feigning a Peace, and cauſing it to be proclaimed, ſet open the City Gates, but ſhe and her followers almoſt ſtarved out with Famine, were ſcarce departed, when he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to be purſued, in which purſuit many were ſlain, and taken Priſoners, and amongſt them Earl <hi>Robert,</hi> who by this time was returned with a ſlender Train, and others taking Sanctuary in the Nunnery of <hi>Worwell</hi> were burnt together with the Houſe, nor did the Biſhop ſpare <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> but fired it for taking part with the Empreſs.</p>
               <p>The Empreſs eſcaping this Storm, betook her ſelf to the Caſtle of the <hi>Devizes</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> but being cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſſed by the prevailing party, and out of all hopes of relief, ſhe contrived a Stratagem to prevent her fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into their hands, <hi>viz.</hi> Incloſing her ſelf in a Coffin and making it known to a few of her Truſty Friends, under pretence it was the dead Body of a Perſon, whom the Beſiegers knew to be dead in that place, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing a paſs for the burial of it with its Anceſtors: She was in a Horſe-litter carried to <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and there joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully received by thoſe of their Party. But finding it not ſafe to continue there, ſhe haſted to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where being ſtraightly Beſieged by the King in the depth of Winter, and the Suburbs gain'd, ſhe found her ſelf in no capacity longer to defend the place; but taking the advantage of a Snow that had fallen, ſhe put on white Garments, and by that means in the dusk of the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſed alone undiſcovered to <hi>Abington</hi> on Foot, and from thence to <hi>Wallingford</hi> on Horſeback the ſame Night, (ſo ſweet is a Crown, that no Difficulties, or Dangers are thought too much to attain it.) It was

However that he might aſſure the Succeſſion of his Son <hi>Euſtuce,</hi> he called a Council at <hi>London,</hi> commanded <hi>Theobald</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> to Anoint him King; but having received the Pope's Mandate to the contrary, he refuſed it, for which he was obliged to leave the Land, and flie to <hi>Normandy;</hi> yet the King for this refuſal ſeized upon his Poſſeſſions. But ſhortly after, Prince <hi>Euſtace</hi> dying, the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more inclinable to an agreement with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. The death of this Prince is by ſome Hiſtorians thus reported, <hi>viz.</hi> Having ſet fire to the Corn Fields belonging to the Abby of <hi>Bury,</hi> becauſe the Monks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to ſupply him with a ſum of Money for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion, after that at his firſt ſitting down to Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, upon the firſt bit of Bread he touched he fell diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and died in that fit, but this ſeems a Fable of the Monks to terrifie people from medling with their <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> or the abundance of Treaſure they in thoſe days of Ignorance ſcraped to themſelves even from thoſe that had far greater need: However the Kings hope dying in this Prince, he was content to adopt <hi>Henry,</hi> by ſome called <hi>Fitz</hi> Empreſs, though indeed <hi>Plantaginet;</hi> for his Son and Succeſſor, to whom at <hi>Oxford</hi> in the great Aſſembly held there for that purpoſe, the Peers did Homage, as to the undoubted Heir, and the Prince ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the King as his Father, and after whom he was to Reign; nor did <hi>Stephen</hi> live long when this was done, for being afflicted with the <hi>Illiack paſio,</hi> and the <hi>Haemorhoids</hi> worn out with Labour and continual toil, left the Crown which he had worn with ſo much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and variety of Fortune, to young <hi>Henry</hi> dying at <hi>Dover, Anno</hi> 1134, and was Buried at <hi>Feverſham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> though afterward his Body (only for the value of the Lead that incloſed it) was caſt into the River by the covetous Sexton.</p>

               <p>THis King, from the place of his Birth, was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>Caernavon;</hi> he began his Reign <hi>anno</hi> 1307, and proſecuting the Wars of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he obliged many of the Scotch Nobility to doe him Homage at <hi>Dumſreize,</hi> and upon his return he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned <hi>Walter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chester,</hi> ſeizing upon all his Goods and Credits, for cauſing by his Complaint the Baniſhment of <hi>Gaveſton,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, as likewiſe himſelf to be reſtrained in his diſorderly way of living: Then paſſing the Seas, he at <hi>Bulloign</hi> in <hi>France</hi> married young <hi>Iſabel,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Philip the Fair.</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and returned with her in a moſt ſplendid manner, bringing back
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:46420:63"/>with him <hi>Gaveston,</hi> his darling Favourite, who was a Gentleman Stranger brought up with him in his youth, and now under the Influence of the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be ſo imperious, that the Nobility was ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, yet the King, who thought nothing too dear for his Minion, not only upheld him, but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied him with Treaſure to the higheſt Profuſeneſs, giving him his Jewels, and wiſhing nothing more than that he might ſucceed him in the Throne, which obliged the Parliament to paſs an Act for his perpetual Baniſhment, but had much difficulty to get it paſſed by the King; nor did he doe it but to paſs another, giving him a great Summe of Money, however with reluctancy he ſigned it; yet he would ſuffer his Privado whom he had made Earl of <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall</hi> to be no farther from him than <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he maintained him in a ſplendid manner, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a while called him to Court, and married him to <hi>Joan</hi> of <hi>Acres,</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> his Siſters Daughter, which made him more inſolent than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, conſuming the King's Treaſure in Feaſts, Plays, and other Riotous Proceedings, at ſuch a rate, that there was not enough left to ſupply the neceſſities of the Court, drawing the King likewiſe into ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries, that the Queen finding her ſelf ſenſibly injured, reproved him at firſt with mildneſs, but finding that ineffectual, ſhe openly complained; ſo that <hi>Gaveston</hi> was a third time baniſhed; yet he ſtaid not long before the King privately ſent for him, making him principal Secretary of State, which ſo incenſed as well the Biſhops as the Temporal Lords, that they reſolved to expell him by Force of Arms, chuſing for their Leader <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and at <hi>Dathington,</hi> whither his Fear had driven him, he was ſurprized by <hi>Guy</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed him to <hi>Blacklow,</hi> where ſeveral of the Nobles conſulting, that if he was ſet at Liberty he would work their Ruine with the King, they proceeded to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:46420:64"/>prevent it, and without any formal Tryall cauſed his head to be ſtruk off, which greatly incenſed the King, and raiſed in him a mortal Enmity againſt thoſe Lords, yet by the Mediation of <hi>Gilbert</hi> Earl of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> they were ſeemingly forgiven.</p>
               <p>The Scots about this time riſing in arms under <hi>David Bruce,</hi> whom they had choſen their King, or Leader, entering <hi>England,</hi> and doing great Miſchief in <hi>Northumberland.</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> marched againſt them; but in this expedition many of the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Lords refuſed to aid him, under pretence that he had delayed to ratifie their Liberties and Charters, through which defect he received a great overthrow near <hi>Bannocksbourn;</hi> for there the two Armies joining, the crafty Scots had in divers places made deep Trenches, covering them with rotten Hurdles and Earth, ſo that the Engliſh Chavalry preſſing on, fell into thoſe Pits, and were gored up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſharp Stakes that were placed at the bottom; and although the King behaved himſelf with much bravery, refuſing to leave the field till he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thence by his Friends, yet the Earl of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> the Lord <hi>Clifford,</hi> and about ſeven hundred Knights and Eſquires, with a great number of common Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, were ſlain, many Nobles taken Priſoners, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a large Booty; and this was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Advantage the Scots ever gained over the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, which encouraged them to make deeper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads with whom ſome of the diſcontented Engliſh joined, while King <hi>Edward</hi> in the moſt ſolemn Pomp interred the Body of <hi>Gaveſton</hi> at <hi>Kings-Langley</hi> in <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi> and ſoon after inſtead of one he raiſed up two Privadoes, or Favourites, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Spencers,</hi> Father and Son, who perceiving themſelves high in the King's Favour, inſtead of taking warning by the Fate of <hi>Gaveſton,</hi> they ſtrove to exceed him to pride and Arrogance, which ſoon procured them the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the Nobles to ſuch a degree, that the King
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:46420:64"/>could not conſider himſelf in Safety till he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to their Baniſhment. But now the Queen, who had hitherto been a Mediatrix between the King and his Barons, being denied a Night's Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one of the Baron's Caſtles, ſhe ſo highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Affront, that her former good Offices were changed into Studies of Revenge; and in this humour ſhe laboured with the King to ruine thoſe ſhe a little before had ſought to protect; and the King eaſily exaſperated, ſoon conſented to pleaſure her to his Power; and therefore to croſs the Barons, he cauſed the Judgment againſt the <hi>Spencers</hi> to be reverſed.</p>
               <p>Some of the delinquent Lords, fearing the Storm that threatened them, ſubmitted to the King, others were taken Priſoners as the two <hi>Roger Mortimers,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son, and committed to the Tower, but the reſt reſolved to ſtand out under the Leading of the Earl of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> but they were overthrown at <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough-bridg</hi> where <hi>Humphrey de Bohun</hi> was ſlain by a Spear from under the Bridge. And the Earl, with other principal Men to the number of Ninety, or upwards, moſt of them Barons and Knights were taken Priſoners by <hi>Andrew de Herkerly,</hi> Captain of <hi>Carliſle;</hi> for which Service he was afterward created Earl of that place.</p>
               <p>Theſe Noble Priſoners were not long confined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they too ſenſibly felt the King's Anger, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puſhed on by the Queen, the <hi>Spencers,</hi> and other Court Favourites; he cauſed the Earl of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> his Unkle to be beheaded at <hi>Pontefract,</hi> where he ſtayed five hours upon the Scaffold before the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff could procure an Executioner, and the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons and Knights were hanged and quartered in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places. And here the Queen had her Revenge; for the Lord <hi>Badelmere,</hi> who refuſed her the Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, being taken amongſt others, was hanged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it; ſo that by this rigorous Execution moſt of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:46420:65"/>the Noble Engliſh Bloud ſupplyed the thirſty Earth with too precious a draught: But it appears that this Cruelty was rather an Act of the Courtiers, than done by the King's natural Inclination; for one of a mean family being taken in the Rebellion, and the Favourites pleading earneſtly for his Pardon, the King, in a great rage reviled them in theſe terms, <hi>viz. A plague upon you curſed Whiſperers, malitious Backbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, wicked Counſelors! Intreat you for the Life of a moſt notorious Knave, who would not ſpeak one word for the Life of my near Kinſman, that moſt noble Knight, Earl</hi> Thomas? <hi>By the Soul of God this Fellow ſhall dye the death he has deſerved;</hi> and accordingly he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1322. The King, to revenge former Injuries, marched with a great Army into <hi>Scotland,</hi> but through the neglect of his Purveyors a great Scarcity of Proviſion happening, he was conſtrained, without performing any memorable Action to make his Retreat; nor was the Scots ſo contented, but falling on his Rear, not only cut off a great many of his Men, but obliged him to leave his Baggage, with much Treaſure, as a Prey to them. But now the Pope, in favour of <hi>England,</hi> having interdicted <hi>Scotland,</hi> a Truce was concluded between the two Kingdoms for thirteen Years, and ſo ended this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious War, and the King had leiſure to make his Progreſs through the ſeveral Counties of <hi>York, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter,</hi> and the Marches of <hi>Wales,</hi> puniſhing ſuch as had been in the former Rebellion, and amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Andrew de Herkerley,</hi> was drawn, hanged, and quartered, for taking part with the Scots. But now a greater Storm began to gather; for young <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> making his Eſcape out at a Window, and ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> fled beyond the Seas, and joined himſelf to other Fugitives, and baniſhed En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh; and not long after the <hi>Spencers</hi> oppreſſing the Kingdom, and ſetting the King againſt the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:46420:65"/>Queen, ſhe, under a pretence of Viſiting her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Court at <hi>Paris,</hi> found means, with her Son <hi>Edward,</hi> to get beyond the Seas, and refuſed, upon the King's ſending for her, to return, till ſhe, joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with <hi>Mortimer,</hi> her dear Fovourite, and other Lords, raiſing a conſiderable Power, and holding Correſpondence with the Lords that yet were diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in <hi>England,</hi> landed in a hoſtil manner, and marched againſt the King, who was preparing to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her, ſeizing upon many conſiderable Towns.</p>
               <p>The King by this Proceeding finding himſelf in diſtreſs, and that the <hi>Londoners,</hi> and many of the Lords, had declared againſt him, ſetting the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners every where at Liberty, and recalling thoſe that were baniſhed, thought it good to avoid co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Battel; whereupon the Queen, with her Forces, ſate down before <hi>Briſtol,</hi> took it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Spencer</hi> the Elder, whom ſhe cauſed to be cut up alive, after being dragged through the Streets for the Satisfaction of the People, who mortally hated him. And now the King finding himſelf in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner forſaken, fled into <hi>Wales,</hi> and there for a time lay ſecret in the Abby of <hi>Neath;</hi> but in the end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcovered, and with him the younger <hi>Spencer, Robert Baldok,</hi> Chancellour, and <hi>Simon de Reading;</hi> the King hereupon was conveyed to <hi>Kenelworth</hi> Caſtle, and the Lords to <hi>Hereford,</hi> where the Queen lay, and there <hi>Spencer</hi> and <hi>Reading</hi> being condemned by Sir <hi>William Truſſel,</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they were hanged.</p>
               <p>The Confederates with the Queen having in this manner impriſoned the King, and not conceiving it ſafe to ſet him at Liberty, reſolved amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to make <hi>Edward</hi> his Son, a Prince of about thirteen years of Age, King, and thereupon ſent Sir <hi>William Truſſel</hi> to the Caſtle where the King was Priſoner, to acquaint him with what was intended, which put him into a mortal Agony, from whence
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46420:66"/>being recovered, he greatly lamented and bewailed his hard Fate; however <hi>Truſſel</hi> being inſtructed what to doe, proceeded to unking him in theſe words: <hi>I</hi> William Truſſel, <hi>in the Name of all Men of the Land of</hi> England, <hi>and of all the Parliament, Procurator, do reſign to thee</hi> Edward <hi>the Homage that was made to thee ſome time, and from this time forward I deprive thee, and defie thee of all Power Royal, and I ſhall never be tendent to thee after this time.</hi> Anno Dom. 1327.</p>
               <p>And here, following the Rule of other Hiſtorians, we put an End to his Reign, though he lived in Captivity, as we ſhall have occaſion to mention in the Reign of his Son.</p>

               <p>Upon theſe Conſiderations the young King, eight days after his Father's Reſignation, was crowned with the uſual Ceremonies; but the old King being yet alive, and the People compaſſionating his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, his Depoſers thought themſelves no ways ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, eſpecially <hi>Mortimer,</hi> who was ſuſpected to be over familiar with the Queen, and from that time they fell to plotting his death; in order to which <hi>Mortimer</hi> procured an expreſs from the young King to remove him, under pretences of Friendſhip and Advantage, but indeed that he might put him into ſuch hands as he was ſure would diſpatch him, and thereupon he was conveyed to <hi>Berkley</hi> Caſtle, when by the way, for fear he ſhould be reſcued by the People, who had yet ſome remains of Love for him, they ſet him on a Mole-hill, in order to ſhave him, for the better diſquiſe, and in an inſulting manner told him, That the Water of the next Ditch ſhould accommodate him for that purpoſe, to which the ſorrowfull King replied, That there ſhould be warm Water whether they would or not, and thereupon

As for the French Army, the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Alanſon,</hi> had the charge of the Van-guard, King <hi>Philip</hi> of the Main Battel, and the Earl of <hi>Savoy</hi> of the Rear; and no ſooner the Charge was ſounded, but a bloudy Conflict enſued, whilſt King <hi>Edward</hi> ſtood upon a hill with his Battalion to behold the Event, and at the beginning the French Horſe charging with great Fury, made the Prince give way, and had allmoſt encloſed his Battalion, which made the Nobles that had the care of his Perſon ſend to the King, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertize him of the danger his Son was in, when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding only whether the Prince was alive, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified

               <p>This Treaty proving ineffectual, the King took the Town of <hi>Ponthois,</hi> and gave large ſpoil to his Soldiers, which obliged the French King to remove his Court from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Troyis</hi> in <hi>Champaigne;</hi> and now to facilitate the Engliſh Conqueſts, the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin having put a ſenſible Affront upon the Queen, his Mother, ſhe conceived a mortal hatred, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to ruine him, confederating with the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and procuring her ſelf, by reaſon of the King's Imbecility, to be made Regent of <hi>France;</hi> and ſoon after the Dauphin cauſing <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> to be ſlain in his preſence, as he came to doe him Homage, for contriving, as he ſaid, the death of <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> that he might the better ſway the Kingdom under an infirm King. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> the young Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> to revenge his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's death, cloſed with King <hi>Henry,</hi> and proceeded to perſuade <hi>Charles,</hi> the French King, to diſinherit the Dauphin, and give the Lady <hi>Katharine</hi> in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to the King o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>EDward</hi> the eldeſt Son to <hi>Richard,</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> in the beginning of his Reign, found great oppoſition from the <hi>Lancastrians,</hi> who pitying the Misfortune of pious King <hi>Henry,</hi> raiſed Forces in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts; he was crowned at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> but the Citizens, who had been the greateſt Sticklers for him, not finding him anſwer their expectations, in performing the Promiſes he had made them, began to decline his Intereſt, however he marched againſt the Forces raiſed in the North, giving the Lord <hi>Fitz-walter</hi> battel at <hi>Ferrybridg,</hi> near <hi>Pontefract,</hi> but not being able to maintain it, he was there, with moſt of his men, cut in pieces by <hi>Henry</hi>'s Forces, when both Armies facing on the Plain between <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and <hi>Saxton,</hi> on the 28th of <hi>March</hi> they joined Battel, that of <hi>Edwards</hi> conſiſting of 48660 men, and <hi>Henry</hi>'s of 60000, but by the <hi>Lancastrians</hi> miſtaking Stars for Suns, being the Cognizance of each Party, and doubting ſome Treaſon in the caſe, many of them fled; ſo that thoſe who remained loſt the field; and in this Battel were ſlain the Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> the Lords <hi>Clifford, Neuel, Wells, Scales, Beaumont, Dacres, Grey, Willoughby, Fitzhug,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſons, of Quality, about 357, and in all 35091, being the moſt bloudy and obſtinate Battel that had been fought; upon this Overthrow <hi>Henry,</hi> with his Queen and Son, fled into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and were
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:46420:88"/>honourably received by King <hi>James,</hi> whoſe Siſter Prince <hi>Edward</hi> not long after married.

               <p>The Queen, a Woman of a Martial Spirit, by her Intereſt in <hi>France</hi> had by this time gotten a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable number of Men; but ſailing for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards making for <hi>England,</hi> her Fleet was ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a Tempeſt; ſo that ſhe and her Husband were left ſolely to the Aid of the Scots, and with what Forces they could gather, marched as far as the Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham;</hi> but the Forces of the Scots were defeated at <hi>Hegely</hi> Moor, where Sir <hi>Ralph Percie</hi> dying, ſaid in alluſion of his Oath to King <hi>Henry.

               <p>This way not ſucceeding, the Mayor was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Summon the Citizens to meet at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> made ſeveral Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to perſuade them to reject the Line of King <hi>Edward</hi> and own the Protectour for their King, but all he could obtain, was only the Shouts of ſome Servants and Foot-boys, who were ordered to be there for that purpoſe, which the Duke laying hold of as the Conſent of the People, he told them it was a very goodly Cry; and then whilſt the Citizens ſtood amazed at his diſcourſe, he deſired them to make their humble Petition to the Protectour, that he
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:46420:95"/>would receive the Crown, and take upon him the Kingly Government; and accordingly the next day the Mayor, Aldermen, and ſome of the Commoners with abundance of Rabble at their Heels, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and ſome other Lords to <hi>Bainard</hi>'s Caſtle, where the Protector kept his Court, and ſending in their Meſſage, the Protector appeared in the Balcony, as ſeeming to fear ſome danger of his perſon, if he give them nearer acceſs, feigning an Ignorance of their coming, and when <hi>Buckingham</hi> (having firſt intreated his Graces Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and a Licenſe to acquaint him with the cauſe of their coming) declared it was to beſeech him to take the Crown and Government upon him; he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked angry, and diſſembled an amazement at ſuch a requeſt, proteſting againſt it, and was forced, (if you will believe it) to be threatened into an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of what he had ſo paſſionately ſought; for by <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s declaring, that none of <hi>Edward</hi>'s Race ſhould Reign over them, and therefore they had offered the Crown to him, which if he refuſed, they would give to another of a different Family that ſhould be worthy of it: Hereupon with a ſeeming unwillingneſs; he told them, ſeeing they were ſo bent againſt the Linage of his dear Brother, which he was ſorry to hear; rather than they ſhould be deſtitute of a King of the Royal Bloud, in the houſe of the Plantagenets, he ſhould be content to ſubmit to their deſires, and take the Government upon himſelf.

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who had been mainly Inſtrumental in raiſing <hi>Richard</hi> to the Throne, ſoon after this Murther fell into diſcontent, ſome ſay, for that the King refuſed him the Duke of <hi>Herefords</hi> Lands, to which he pretended himſelf rightfull Heir others, becauſe he was not looked upon and eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at Court as he expected, but he declared it was from a Remorſe for the Murther of the two Princes, of which he could not but conceit himſelf ſomewhat Guilty, becauſe he had raiſed one to the Throne that had cauſed them to be Murthered though he was ignorant of the Fact, or its Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and hereupon leaving the Court, he retired to his Caſtle of <hi>Brecknock,</hi> and there conferring with Biſhop <hi>Morton,</hi> that crafty Clergy-man, to gain his entire Liberty, ſo fed the Dukes Ambition, who was naturally of an aſpiring Spirit; that after having founded his Inclinations, he plainly told him that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing grived him ſo much, ſince there was ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a perſon allied to the Crown, that a Tyrant and Murtherer ſhould ſit upon the Throne, commending the Duke to be a perſon of ſuch rare vertues, that none merrited to wear the Crown ſo much as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and although the Duke excuſed it, in telling him <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Richmond</hi> had a right before him, he was prompt enough to harken to ſo pleaſing a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Theſe debates, that ſeemed at firſt in jeſt, came at laſt to earneſt, for <hi>Buckingham</hi> reſolving (if poſſible) to diſplace King <hi>Richard;</hi> Communicated

               <p>Theſe Matters were not carried ſo privately, but the King got notice of them, and ſent a very kind Meſſage to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to invite him to Court; but he excuſing it, by reaſon of pretended Indiſpoſition; an Expreſs was ſent to command him to come, or he would fetch him dead or alive, by this he knew it was time to ſtand upon his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and returned anſwer that he would not come to his Mortal Enemy, and thereupon ſending for <hi>Thomas</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Dorſet</hi> out of a Sanctuary, and gathering ſuch power as he could in the North, whilſt Sir <hi>Edward Courtney</hi> and his Brother the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> raiſed another in <hi>Devonſhire</hi> and <hi>Cornwall,</hi> as likewiſe did Sir <hi>Richard Guilford</hi> and other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in <hi>Kent,</hi> they reſolved to joyn their Forces; but before it could be effected, the King marched directly againſt the Duke with a great power, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his little Army moſtly conſiſting of Welſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, diſbanded, and left him to ſhift for himſelf, ſo that he was forced to hide him in a poor diſguiſe putting himſelf into the hands of one <hi>Humphrey Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,</hi> that had been his Servant and raiſed by him to what Eſtate he had, and with him he lived for ſome time as his Gardener; but the treacherous man upon the Kings putting out a Proclamation, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

               <p>The meaſures of the Confederacy thus broken, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were impriſoned, and put to death, and the King fearing an Invaſion, cauſed the Sea Coaſts to be guarded and fortified, and then aſſembled a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> wherein the Earl of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and all his Adherents that had fled the Land, were attainted, and proclaimed Enemies of the Country, their Goods and Poſſeſſions were confiſcated; nor did <hi>Richard</hi> delay to uſe the ſame Practices his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had done, ſending his Agents to the Duke of <hi>Bretaigne,</hi> in whoſe Court the Earl reſided, with ſtore of Gold, and many Preſents, to perſuade that Duke either to ſend <hi>Richmond</hi> Priſoner into <hi>England,</hi> or if he refuſed that, to keep him a Priſoner there, and miſſed but a little of ſucceeding; for the Duke lying ſick, and <hi>Peter Landois,</hi> his Treaſurer overcome with the Preſents, had delivered him into the hands of ſuch as were appointed to receive him, had not the Earl had notice of the deſign, and made his Eſcape; but the Duke highly blamed this Action of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, and diſcharged him his Office.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> knowing whilſt his Brother's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were alive, that his Title was but ill grounded, and therefore to ſtrengthen it he propoſed (though Queen <hi>Ann</hi> his Wife was living) to marry <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Niece, by that means to croſs <hi>Richmond</hi>'s Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,

               <p>The King being of a martial Spirit, and impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of Eaſe, ſent his Heralds at Arms to the French King, there in his Name, and as in right belonging to the Engliſh Crown, to demand the Dutchies of <hi>Normandy, Guine, Main,</hi> and <hi>Anjou;</hi> but they being refuſed, he failed into <hi>France</hi> with a conſiderable Army, beſieged <hi>Terwin;</hi> and thither came <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> the Emperour, as a voluntary aider to the King, and ſerved under the Engliſh Standard as a Knight of the Order of the Garter, and the French advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing with a conſiderable power to the relief of this place, were routed allmoſt without fighting; ſo from their cowardly running away, being moſt Horſe, it was called in deriſion, The Battel of Spurs;

               <p>King <hi>Hen.</hi> victorious in <hi>France,</hi> the French ſought all Ways for an Accommodation, and at laſt, Pope <hi>Leo</hi> becoming Moderatour, a Peace was concluded; and ſoon after <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. married <hi>Mary,</hi> the King's younger Siſter, at <hi>Albeville,</hi> with great ſplendour; yet he lived but 82 days after; for being aged, and infirm, and over ſtriving himſelf to pleaſure a beautious, lively, young Lady, it no doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the haſtening his End; and upon his Death the Queen returning for <hi>England,</hi> was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately married at <hi>Callais</hi> to <hi>Charles Bradon,</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> her firſt Lover, and from whom ſhe had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly parted, to fall into the Arms of Majeſty. And now by the too free Acceſs of Foreigners Trade greatly decreaſing, one <hi>John Lincoln,</hi> and other ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved perſons, put up a Bill of Complaint, and it was read by the Miniſter at the Spital Sermon.

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:46420:104"/>the Houſes of the Strangers, committing many Outrages on their Perſons: Nor was the Magiſtracy able to quell them; for being all in an uproar, the Lieutenant of the Tower, who had no Good-Will for the City, played the Great Guns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; but the Rage of the Multitude ſpent, they retired to their reſpective Habitations, yet ſeveral were taken and tried, of which number <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and 13 more, moſt of them youths, were hanged in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places of the City, and about 200 Men and Boys, and 9 Girls and Women, went in their Shifts only, being bare headed, footed, and legged, and Ropes about their Necks, to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where at the upper end of the Hall the King ſate, and after he had ſharply reproved them, and they on their knees had begged Mercy, <hi>Wolſey,</hi> by the King's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, pronounced their Pardon, whereat with a joyfull Cry they threw up their Halters, in token of deliverance from death, and this day ever ſince is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Evil <hi>May</hi> day, and ſoon after <hi>Tournay</hi> was reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the French, in conſideration they paid the King 600000 Crowns in twelve years, and the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin to marry the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when ſhe ſhould be of ſufficient years of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; but if the Marriage took no effect, then the City to be reſtored, and <hi>Wolſey,</hi> who by this time had bought him a Cardinal's Cap; to have 1000 Marks a year for the profits of the Biſhoprick; and <hi>Wolſey</hi> having power with the King to doe all, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring a former Affront put upon by <hi>Edward Stafford,</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> he uſed his intereſt to the deſtruction of that great Peer, who was behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> upon pretence of aſpiring to the Crown.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1521. the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> V. in his way to <hi>Spain</hi> landed at. <hi>Dover</hi> for Refreſhment, and at the King's earneſt Requeſt came to <hi>London,</hi> and was royally entertained with all the Magnificence

               <p>All hopes by this means, and other diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, being loſt to the Papiſts of bringing their Deſigns about, by Clandeſtine ways, the Pope ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to Invade the Kingdom, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it him as the Patrimony of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing him ſucceſs, whereupon he gathered his huge Armado, which he named Invincible, even whilſt there was a Treaty of peace on Foot, yet the Queen having notice from <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, King of <hi>France,</hi> what was intended againſt her, prepared by Sea and Land, to expect the Storm, pitching her Camp at <hi>Tillbury</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> conſiſting of 15000 Horſe, and 22000 Foot, and for her own Guard out of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Countys ſhe drew 23520 Horſemen and 34500 Foot-men, and in the remarkable year 1588, on the 20th. of <hi>July,</hi> the Spaniards with their huge Hulks, which appeared on the Sea, like floating Caſtles paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Plymouth</hi> towards <hi>Calais</hi> to joyn the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Neitherlands</hi> for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> but were diſperſed with a mighty Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, yet gathered again, but were ſo beaten by the Engliſh, under the command of the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> Admiral, Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> and others, that of 134. great Ships that Sail from <hi>Lisbon</hi> only 53 returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo that there were miſſing 81 Veſſels, 13000

               <p>For this great deliverance the Queen gave pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Thanks in St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Church, and the Spaniſh Priſoners and Streamers were brought to <hi>London,</hi> and the Queen reſolving to be even with the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard for this Treachery, ſent Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> and others into the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> where they took many Spaniſh Towns and Ships, with great ſtore of Gold and Silver, and after that ſhe aſſiſted <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> the expulſed King of <hi>Portugal</hi> to recover his right, whereupon they burnt <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and the Shiping in the Harbour worth five Millions, took ſeveral Towns in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and marched to the very Gates of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> againſt which the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> breaking his Lance, demanded the proudeſt Spaniard of them all to come and anſwer him.

And upon his firſt ſitting in Council he made a Speech, in which amongſt other Expreſſions are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>I ſhall make it my endeavour to preſerve this Government, both in Church and State, as it is now by Law Eſtabliſhed: I know the Principles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are for Monarchy, and the Members of it have ſhewed themſelves good and loyal Subjects: Therefore I ſhall always take care to Defend and Support it. I know too that the Laws of <hi>England</hi> are ſufficient to make the King as a great a Monarch as I can wiſh, and as I ſhall never depart from the Juſt Rights and Prerogatives of the Crown, ſo I ſhall never In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade any Man's Property. I have often hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ventured my Life in Defence of this Nation, and I ſhall ſtill go as far as any man in preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, in all its Juſt Rights and Liberties.</q>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:46420:126"/>Nor was it long before a Proclamation was Iſſued forth to give notice the King intended to call a Parliament, inculcating therein the ſettlement of the Revenue for the ſupport of the Crown and Government; that there was a neceſſity for the maintenance of the Navy for the Kingdoms defence, and the advantage of Trade, in order to which he deſired that the ſettlement of the Cuſtoms due in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, declaring it was his will and pleaſure that the Duties ſhould be Collected accordingly, and that he did not doubt of the ready complyance of his Subjects therein. This being given forth, the Merchants did not diſpute the payment: And the next thing taken in hand, was the preparation for the funeral of the deceaſed King, all perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to, or having buſineſs at the Court being commanded, by an Order of the Earl Marſhal, to put themſelves into decent Mourning, and indeed the loſs of a Prince that ruled ſo much in the hearts of his Subjects found a ready complyance, for not onely the Courtiers were in Mourning, but all the reſponſible perſons of the Kingdom; and his Royal Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Denmark,</hi> on the tenth of <hi>February,</hi> took his place at the Council Board, as a Privy Councellour of this Kingdom.</p>

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:46420:127"/>the Ceremony was performed with much Magnificence; and the Parliament, according to appointment met; when the King, in his Robes, went to the Houſe, and being ſeated on the Throne made a Speech in which, amongſt other things, He informed them that the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> was Landed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with the men he brought with him from <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp;c and ſoon We had notice that that Earl had levyed conſiderable Forces in <hi>Argyleſhire</hi> and other places, which obliged the Militia to riſe in Arms, and ſeveral Troops were ſent from <hi>England,</hi> and more had gone had not the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> landed at <hi>Lyme</hi> in <hi>Dorcetſhire,</hi> with about fourſcore men, and a conſiderable quantity of Arms and Amunition, declaring his intention to deliver the Kingdom from the danger it was likely to be brought into by the prevailing power of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, under the influence of a King who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelf openly to be of the Roman Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, &amp;c. and divers of his Declarations were printed and ſcattered abroad, for printing which, one Mr. <hi>Deſney,</hi> a Councellour was ſeized and Tryed at the <hi>Marſhalſea,</hi> upon an Indictment of High Treaſon; and being by the Jury found guilty he was ſentenced and executed; his head being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward placed on <hi>London</hi> Bridge.</p>

And divers Prieſts and other diſaffected perſons were ſeized in ſundry Counties, and committed to ſeveral Priſons; and the Circular Letters ſent abroad, the Papiſts were commanded to depart the Citys of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminster:</hi> And many eminent Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> upon notice that the Treaſury was Exhauſted, lent towards the defraying the Charges of the Publick Affairs of the Kingdom, about 300000 <hi>
                     <abbr>l</abbr>
                  </hi> which was paid in at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> for the uſe of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer: Nor was the <hi>Scots</hi> ſlow in making their Addreſs for Protection; which many of the Lords and Commnns did, and were kindly received, with a promiſe at their Requeſt, of Iſſuing out Letters for the meeting of a Convention of the Eſtates on the 14th day of <hi>March,</hi> at <hi>Edenburg,</hi> which gave a general Satisfaction to <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 22d of <hi>January,</hi> 1688. According to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:46420:130"/>appointment, the Convention met at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where the Lord Marqueſs of <hi>Hallifax</hi> held the place as Speaker, in the Houſe of Lords, <hi>Henry Powell,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> did the like in that of the Commons: And after ſome Debates and Conſiderations for the Settlement of Affairs, they made an Addreſs of Thanks for the Royal Care and Conduct; and at their Intreaty a further continuation of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration was Accepted; and the days were Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for a Publick Thankſgiving for the great Deliverance of theſe Kingdoms. But in <hi>Ireland</hi> things went not on ſo proſperouſly, for the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> greatly oppreſſed the Proteſtants, ſuffered the Papiſts to plunder their Houſes, every where diſarming them, and putting them out of places of Truſt; however in ſeveral parts of that Kingdom the Proteſtants, under the leading of Noblemen and others, gave them notable overthrows. But the Popiſh party relying upon the Succours they expected from <hi>France,</hi> gave not over their Ravages and Outrages. However great preparations were made in <hi>England</hi> to reduce that Kingdom to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſome Stores of Ammunition and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions ſent from <hi>Scotland;</hi> and care was taken to ſtop ſuch as were going over, and a prohibition was laid on <hi>French</hi> Goods and Manufactures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now the deſire of the people being to ſee their preſent Majeſtys on the Throne, a great number of worthy perſons, in the Citys of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> Petitioned, ſetting forth it was their humble deſire it might be ſpeedily done; and ſoon after Her preſent Majeſty, upon the earneſt Invitation of the Eſtates, Embarqued for <hi>England,</hi> attended by a Squadron of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Men of War; and arrived ſafely at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> on the 12th of <hi>February,</hi> 1688. to the inexpreſſible Joy of the people, and was ſaluted all the way Her Yatch paſſed by the Forts and Ships in the Road,

               <p>Matters prepared in readineſs for ſo great and ſolemn an Occaſion; the Lords and Commons on the 13th of <hi>February,</hi> having acquainted them with what they had done, and obtained their Conſent. About Eleven of the Clock they went to <hi>White-Hall</hi> Gate, where the Officers and Serjeants at Arms, Trumpets and other perſons being preſent, Sir <hi>Thomas St. George</hi> Knight, Garter Principal King at Arms, receiving the Proclamation, and the Officers at Arms, by the Lords being ordered immediately to Proclaim it; <hi>York</hi> Herauld Proclaimed it at <hi>White-Hall</hi> Gate, after the Trumpets had thrice ſounded, <hi>Garter</hi> reading it by periods in the preſence of the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:46420:131"/>Lords and Commons, and a great concourſe of people, and the ſatisfaction conceived was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by loud ſhouts and general Acclamations of Joy; and in good order they proceeded to <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> where having informed the occaſion of their coming; they had the Gates opened and all, except the Bailiff of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and his men entred and were received by the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder, Sheriffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When having made a Second Proclamation, they paſſed to <hi>Wood-ſtreet</hi> end in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> and there Proclaimed a Third time, and the like was done before the <hi>Royal Exchange</hi> in <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,</hi> and immediately the great Guns made it known to remote parts; the Evening being conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Ringing of Bells, Bonfires and other demonſtrations of Joy. Nor was it leſs upon the like Proclamation of their Majeſtys in the principal Burroughs and Towns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales.</hi> And two days following his Majeſty was pleaſed to give the two Houſes a further Aſſurance of his Care and Protection for the preſervation of their Religion, Laws and Liberties; and that he was deſirous to concur with them in any thing that ſhould be for the good of the Kingdom, and do what in him lay to advance the Glory and Welfare of the Nation. And thereupon publiſhed his Royal Declaration to reſtrain diſorderly perſons, who took the liberty to kill the Deer, and cut down the Timber in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Chaces and Foreſts, cauſing the Ports in the Weſt facing <hi>Ireland</hi> to be ſtopped, to prevent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected perſons from paſſing over to <hi>Tyrconnel:</hi> And the City of <hi>London,</hi> by the Lord Mayor, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, and divers of the Commons, Congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Majeſtys upon their happy Acceſſion to the Throne; and on the 18th of <hi>February</hi> the King went to the Houſe of Lords, Royally attended, and too his Place on the Throne: when the Gentleman <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſher of the Black Rod, had order to Summon up
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:46420:131"/>the Commons, and they accordingly attending at the Bar of the Lords Houſe, his Majeſty let them know how ſenſible he was of their kindneſs; and how much he eſteemed and valued the confidence they had Repoſed in him, giving them Aſſurance that at no time he would do any thing that might leſſen their good opinion of him, recommending to them the Care of the Allies abroad, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſtate of <hi>Ireland, &amp;c.</hi> And ſoon after his Majeſty being waited on by the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> and about 100. of the <hi>London</hi> Clergy, with an humble Tender of their duty, and fidelity he was pleaſed to expreſs his Gracious promiſe of Protection and Encouragement. And the two Houſes reſolved into a free Parliament; his Majeſty gave the Royal Aſſent to an Act intituled an Act for the removing and preventing all queſtions and diſputes about the Aſſembling and Sitting of this preſent Parliament; putting out his Royal Declaration for bringing in and reſtoring Arms, imbezled during the disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and diſorder, in the late King's Army.</p>
               <p>During theſe proſperous proceedings, we had frequent news from <hi>Ireland,</hi> that the Earl of <hi>Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connel</hi> laboured to increaſe his Army, and to draw away thoſe that yet remained unſhaken; to prevent which, his Majeſty was pleaſed to Iſſue out his Proclamation, offering a pardon of Indemnity to all thoſe that would lay down their Arms and retire to their reſpective habitations, and there quietly and peaceably behave themſelves, and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Law, they ſhould enjoy their Eſtates and Poſſeſſions; likewiſe thoſe of the Roman perſuaſion to have all the liberty of private Exerciſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that the Law allows, with a promiſe of calling a Parliament in that Kingdom: But if any refuſed they were proclaimed Rebels and Traytors and their Lands forfeited, to be diſtributed to thoſe that ſhould be aiding and aſſiſting, to the reducing
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:46420:132"/>the Kingdom. But on the other hand <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> as much as lay in him to hinder this Gratious offer, prevented its being diſperſed in many parts of that Kingdom, and publiſhed a Declaration of his own, wherein he promiſed them wonders, if they would perſevere, and laid before them the danger if they laid down their Arms, whch animated them to great Outrages, however the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants defended <hi>Sligo</hi> and other places, making ſtrong oppoſition, eſpecially in the North, expecting Succours from <hi>England,</hi> where extraordinary Levys were making, and the King the better to encourage his Subjects, conſented to the taking away the Act of Harth Money, which had been a long time very grievous to the poorer ſort of the Nation; for which he received an Addreſs of Thanks from both Houſes, and an other wherein they reſolved to ſtand by him with their Lives and Fortunes, in ſupporting his Allies abroad in reducing <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to ſecure the Proteſtant Religion in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which was very Graciouſly Received; and his Majeſty declared his Opinion, as to what was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for the ſupport of the Nations Glory abroad and at home: And the two Houſes, for declaring to ſtand by his Majeſty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had two humble Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes of Thanks from the City of <hi>London,</hi> and they likewiſe tendred their Addreſs of Thanks to his Majeſty, upon his Condeſcending to have the Harth Money taken away, which was ſhortly after taken away by an Act for ever, onely a Clauſe reſerving to be collected, what was due to the 25th of <hi>March</hi> before the publication of the ſaid Act.</p>
               <p>During theſe proceedings, the King had an Expreſs that a conſiderable number of Soldiers of the Regiment, once commanded by the Lord <hi>Dumbarton,</hi> and ſome Companies of Fuziliers had had mutined near <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> and marched away with the Money ſent to pay them and four Field Pieces,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:46420:132"/>in their way proclaiming King <hi>James;</hi> when to prevent the diſorder, upon the Addreſs of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament they were proclaimed Rebels, and a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable force of Horſe and Dragoons ſent to ſuppreſs them; and accordingly upon their incloſing thoſe mutinous Soldiers, they after ſome ſhew of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, threw down their Arms and ſurrendred them yielding upon diſcretion; when being diſarmed they and their Officers were diſpoſed of in divers priſons, and an Act paſſed the Royal Aſſent, impowering his Majeſty to apprehend ſuch perſons as he ſhould find juſt cauſe to ſuſpect were conſpiring againſt the Government, and an other to take off the Attaindure of <hi>William Ruſſell,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> commonly called <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Ruſſell;</hi> and many other Acts condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to the good and ſettlement of the Kingdom, were ſoon after paſſed.</p>

                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> ſince Sir <hi>Thomas Pilkinton,</hi> was Elected at the <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> and preſented to the Commiſſioners of the Great Seal, and Sworn at the <hi>Huſtings,</hi> and after that by the Lieutenant of the Tower, by reaſon at that time there was no Court held at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>

                  <hi>Scotland</hi> at this time was not wanting, for the Convention purſuant to the King's Circular Letters meeting, <hi>March</hi> 14th, and chuſing Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> their Chairman, they earneſtly laboured for the ſettlement of that Kingdom, which was fallen into ſome diſorder upon the Grand Revolution, Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning the Duke of <hi>Gourdon</hi> to ſurrender the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburg,</hi> and upon his refuſal Proclaimed him and his adherents Traytors; on great penalties prohibiting any to have intercourſe with him, ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring divers ſuſpected perſons, and raiſing Forces to ſecure the Kingdom, with many other things too many here to be incerted.

And now the Coronation day drawing near, the Parliament conſidered of the Coronation Oath, and the Royal Aſſent given to an Act intituled an Act for Eſtabliſhing the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation Oath, to be Adminiſtred to all the Kings and Queens that ſhall Succeed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm, upon their reſpective Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations by one of the Arch-Biſhops to be done in Publick; ſo that nothing being wanting to perfect the Royal Ceremony of the Coronation; on <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 11 of <hi>April,</hi> the King and Queen landing at the Parliament Stairs, went to the Princes Lodgings between 10 and 11 in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and the Peers and Peereſſes being in their Robes, and having their Coronets, their Majeſtys came to <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> (the Proceſſion being put in order) and there taking their Seats on a Throne under a Cloth of State, the Regalia was preſented and delivered to thoſe Noblemen, by whom it was to be born, and the Earl Marſhal, Kings at Arms and Heraulds, having put the Proceſſion in order, it paſſed on through the Guard of Soldiers that made a Lane, blew Cloth being ſpread and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with ſweet hearbs; their Majeſtys, under a Canopy of State, in their Royal Robes, the King in a Velvet Crimſon Cap, and the Queen with a Circlet of Gold on her head, the Peers and Peereſſes
