         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

weighing the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
eſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this Kingdome is
now reduced, with
the confuſion which
threatneth an ineuitable ſeparation,
and iuſtly dreading that the Enemies
of the ſame, aſwell Domeſtique, as
Strangers, will make their vſe by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayling
through the ruine thereof, if
good and ſpeedy order be not taken,
haue thought, that during the Kings
minority, and the keeping priſoner of
<pb facs="tcp:2705:3"/>
the firſt Prince of the Bloud, there was
no remedy more proper, to preuent,
and ſtop ſo great an euill, then to vnite
our ſelues moſt ſtrictly together, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
theſe Articles which follow.</p>
            <p>FIRST, We proteſt to continue
conſtant, and neuer to depart from
that loyall Obedience, and moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Submiſſion which we owe as true
and naturall Subiects of this Crowne,
to the King our Prince &amp; Soueraigne
Lord.</p>
            <p>And becauſe it is well knowne, that
Strangers and ſuch as fauour them,
haue ſeized on the ſacred Perſon of the
King, and on the whole Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and abſolute Gouernement of
the Kingdome, which they doe moſt
vniuſtly vſurpe, and exerciſe, with
great Tyrannie and Oppreſſion, and
doe violently detayne the Prince of
<hi>Conde</hi> priſoner, for no offence or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
cauſe, againſt the publique faith of
the Treatie of <hi>Loudun,</hi> it is moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
that they haue no other end, then
<pb facs="tcp:2705:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to deſtroy the houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> which
now only remayneth of all the Royall
Houſes, and doe ayme at the death of
our Princes, and in it, the change and
ſubuerſion of the State: For theſe
cauſes wee doe faithfully promiſe to
employ with one mind all our power,
goods, and liues for the conſeruation
thereof, and to hinder the miſerable
effects of ſo pernicious deſſignes;
and to take the publique Authority
from them who vſurpe the ſame, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
the King vnto the dignity of his
Crowne, to keepe and maintayne it in
all ſincerity, and integrity; to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
his Maieſty from their wicked
purpoſes, and to keep him out of their
hands; to ſet the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
to repaire the wrong done him,
by puniſhing the Authors of this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
to reuoke all thoſe Offices and
Dignities which haue been beſtowed
ſince the with-holding of them from
thoſe to whom of right they belong:
And to reduce the State into a due
<pb facs="tcp:2705:4"/>
forme, to eſtabliſh vnder the Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Authority of the King, the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Counſell of the Princes of his
bloud, of other Princes, and Officers
of his Crowne, and of thoſe ancient
Counſellers of State, who haue gone
through many great and important
charges, and ſuch likewiſe as are deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
from Noble houſes, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
of great antiquity, who by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
affection and particular intereſt
do affect the preſeruation of the State,
to whom during the minority of our
Kings, or by reaſon of their indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Adminiſtration, Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Direction of publique af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
ought to be referred, by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and fundamentall Lawes of the
Kingdome, by which, both Women
and Strangers are debarred from it.
And if it ſhould ſo happen (from
which GOD in his mercy keepe vs)
that the King ſhould depart this life,
we doe by theſe declare, that wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
after his deceaſe for our
<pb facs="tcp:2705:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
King and Soueraigne Lord, my Lord
the Duke of <hi>Aniou,</hi> which is the true
and lawful Heire and Succeſſor of this
Crowne, and during his minority, my
Lord the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to be lawfull
Regent and Gardian of the Kingdom,
to whom as firſt Prince of the bloud
this preeminence doth belong, with
the Councell before mentioned for
the common direction and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of the affaires of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and not to ſuffer any other to
be admitted vnto the Regency, no not
the Kings Mother, to the preiudice of
the Lawes of this State. And if it
ſhould ſo happen that theſe Vſurpers,
who are moſt expert in limitting the
terme of life, and in plotting the death
of thoſe who ſerue for obſtacles to
their deſſignes, and enterprizes, who
ordinarily in ſuch caſes do vſe Kniues,
and Poyſon, to haſten their Deuilliſh
ends, ſhould attempt (by theſe moſt
deteſtable meanes) to take away the
Kings life, or the Prince of <hi>Conde's,</hi> we
<pb facs="tcp:2705:5"/>
proteſt before the Almighty, both to
ſeeke, and proſequute the iuſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
thereof, by all lawfull meanes
to the vttermoſt of our powers, not
only vpon themſelues who are the
chiefe Actors, but vpon their Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
alſo, domeſtique Seruants, and
Strangers, that in their perſons we
may leaue a memorable example vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſucceeding ages, as well of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
and affection of true Subiects,
as of the iuſt puniſhment of ſo abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
diſloyaltie and impietie.</p>
            <p>And to this purpoſe we will employ
both our Reuenues, and Liues, euen
as long as one drop of bloud remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
in our bodies, and will aduiſe our
poſterity to doe the like after vs. And
that we may prouide for ſuch an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and for the ſafety of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
againſt the plots of Strangers,
and for the Gouernement, and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of the ſame; in caſe we want
a Prince of the bloud, we will call a
Parliament to be aſſembled in a free
<pb facs="tcp:2705:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
place, whither we may haue ſure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
to the end we may proceede
with that order which is conuenient
and neceſſary.</p>
            <p>We doe faithfully promiſe to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
exactly, and obſerue inuiolably
the Lawes of this Kingdome; and in
particular the Treatie of <hi>Loudun,</hi> for
the common good of all the orders of
the State, and for the ſecurity of all the
good and faithfull Subiects of the
King.</p>
            <p>We will maintayne, and continue
the ancient Alliances, Treaties, and
Confederations, renewed by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
King, with forraine Princes, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates,
&amp; Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealths, Friends,
Allies, and Confederates, who are in
the protection of the Crowne, that we
may reeſtabliſh in the conduct of the
affaires of State the ancient maximes
of the late King, which he ſo happily
vſed during his raigne, for the ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his State, and the publique peace
<pb facs="tcp:2705:6"/>
of Christendom, the which many men
haue left since his death.</p>
            <p>We doe further promise, that we
will oppose vnder the Kings authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
by all meanes possible, and namely
by our iuſt Armes, and with the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
of all the Allies, and Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
of this Crowne, all thoſe who
would hinder the effect of this our V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
wherin we haue no further end,

and the dignity of his Crown,
to eſtabliſh his Scepter in his hand,
and in the hands of his lawfull Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors;

            <p>And that we may with the more
ſecurity proſequute ſo laudable and
<pb facs="tcp:2705:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
neceſſary a deſſigne, for the common
defence of the State, the obſeruation
of the publique, and priuate Lawes
thereof.</p>
            <p>And for the deſtruction of thoſe
who are Enemies both to the King
and Kingdome, and by a firme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
entertayne a true and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
concord, and liue together as true
members of one, and the ſame body,
vnder the head which ſhall be elected
by vs; and following the rules which
by vs hereafter ſhall be made, we doe

his hand one to other, whereof God is

all men.</p>
            <p>And to this purpoſe, we doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb facs="tcp:2705:7"/>
all particular intereſts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,

            <p>This Vnion and Aſſociation ſhall

            <p>And to auoide all diuiſions, and
diſcontents which may happen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

we doe ſubmit our ſelues to the

DISCOVRSE VPON
THE SVRRENDRY
OF THE SEALES INTO
THE KINGS HANDS
by M. du Vaiz.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, I willingly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
into your hands,
the charge which it
pleaſed your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie
to honour mee
withall; and with
the ſame countenance that I receiued
it without demanding, I redeliuer
without any griefe at all. The lawes
had ſufficiently inſtructed mee, what
obedience I owe to your Maieſtie; ſo
that you needed not ſend the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
<pb facs="tcp:2705:9"/>
of your Guard with twenty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
to fetch me. Violence ought to
be vſed but againſt ſuch as reſiſt, and
not againſt mee that know how to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
my <hi>Prince,</hi> and haue euer thought
this honour rather to bee an heauy
burthen, then a Dignity, which neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
I did accept for the good of
your ſeruice, becauſe euery vertuous
man doth owe his care and time to
the publique good, and it had beene
a ſhame to haue refuſed to die with
the Sterne in my hand, being able ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to hinder, or at the leaſt to keepe
off awhile the ſtorme that threatens
vs. God grant, Sir, that I be the Man
that ſuffereth moſt by this disfauour,
and that your Maieſtie and the State
be leaſt intereſſed. I am not taken at
vnawares in this accident, hauing euer
foreſeene, that as my beſt endeuours
were ſtil emploied, to follow ſo neere
as poſsible I could, the integritie and
vertue of <hi>Monſieur de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>illeroy,</hi> and the
preſident Monſieur <hi>Iaunin,</hi> ſo ought I
<pb facs="tcp:2705:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
alſo to expect a fortune like to theirs.
Your Maieſties commandement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
in that with the choice my
ſelfe ſhould haue made, if I had beene
at mine owne diſpoſing; deſiring,
rather to be a companion of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
if I may ſo terme freedome
from troubleſome Employments,
then to be vſed in the gouernment of
the State, with thoſe who now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,
being ſubiect in time, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſing
with them, to haue to touch
of their bad tincture, whoſe proſperity
I enuy not, nor the augmentation of
their authoritie, which is giuen vnto
them at my coſt. For I haue neuer
beene accuſtomed, to giue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
euery morning by ſtealth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will I ſuffer any man to preſcribe
me what I ought to doe, if the good of
the State and reaſon doe not aduiſe
me vnto it. It is more honorable for
me, then the ſealing of a bill of eight
hundred thouſand pounds, in this
great penuriouſneſſe of th' Exchec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,
<pb facs="tcp:2705:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to furniſh his turne that bluſheth
not at it: Nay, who beſides this, is not
aſhamed to demand the Duchie of
<hi>Alançon</hi> for a pawne, which is the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a ſonne of <hi>France,</hi> and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the office of Conſtable, which
the deceaſed King would expreſſely
haue ſuppreſſed, after the Death of the
late <hi>Monſieur de Montmorency.</hi> Beleeue
not, Sir, that becauſe I would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to theſe things, I would oppoſe
your Maieſties authoritie. I know, it
hath no other limit then your owne
will. Yet you are obliged to gouerne
your ſelfe according to reaſon, and
follow the counſell of thoſe, that are
entred into the managing of the
State, by the choice of the deceaſed
King, as being more capable to giue
it vnto you then new-commers, drawn
from the dregs of buſineſſe and of the
people. This exchange which is made
from vs to them, is as Woolues vſe
ſheepe, when the Dogges are abſent.
Doth not your Maieſtie perceiue it?
<pb facs="tcp:2705:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
dare you not remedy it for feare of
diſobedience? Sir, by nature you owe
it to them that preach it vnto you, but
they owe the ſame to you, both by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
and humane Lawes. When you
ſhew them the leaſt obedience, they
haue giuen you but too much exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Remember if you pleaſe, that
you are paſt fifteene yeres of age, and
Kings are Maiors at fourteene, <hi>Iſaac</hi>
did follow his father <hi>Abraham</hi> willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be ſacrificed, becauſe he was not
of yeres to feare any thing. I beleeue,
that had he beene a perfect Man, and
had foreſeene the danger, hee would
not haue carried the wood on his
ſhoulders. Theſe are but deceitfull
ſacrifices, I pray God keep your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie
in theſe occaſions from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
For when I ſee that the authority
of the Court is made to moue when
they will, that they create and diſpoſe
of the Officers of the Crowne, and
none ſeeke to hinder them; The
Princes of the bloud, ſome being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned,
<pb facs="tcp:2705:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and others retired for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie
of their perſons; when I ſee
that amongſt the Lords thoſe that are
ſhewed but the ſhaddow of ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fortune, lend their hands to their
owne ſeruitude. Thoſe that haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to any eſtabliſhment in this
ſtrangeneſſe, doe maintaine it for
feare to returne to the miſery of their
firſt condition; ſo that it ſeemeth, the
people and Prouinces doe ſuffer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in this exchange, by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the great Ones, ſeeing that the
helpe of Lawes are vnprofitable, all
being in diſorder, through bribes,
through violences, and through cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
The <hi>Louure</hi> it ſelfe hath taken
a new face, as the Officers haue done.
There is nought of the old Court re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
but the wals, the vſe whereof
is alſo changed, for they were wont to
ſerue for the aſſurance of Princes, but
now they ſerue for their priſon, and (it
may be) for yours, if I may freely ſay
ſo. It is not without ſome plot, that
<pb facs="tcp:2705:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they giue you when you goe forth, a
company of light-horſe-men choſen
by a ſuſpect hand. Theſe are your
Gards, after the manner of the <hi>Baſtille:</hi>
this diſtruſt counſelleth you ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what you ought to doe, and there
needs no other aduice. They hiſſe at
me, they mock me and my diſcourſe:
ſo was <hi>Caſsandra</hi> ſerued in <hi>Homer,</hi> when
ſhe fore-told the deſtruction of <hi>Troy.</hi>
Sir, I haue nothing remaining to ſerue
your Maieſty but my tongue. If I were
ſo happy as to draw your Maieſtie out
of the errour wherein you are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed,
I would a thouſand times
bleſſe my diſgrace, which had giuen
me the boldneſſe to ſpeake freely, yea
in a time when words themſelues are
puniſhed. The falſhood of the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
is no otherwiſe authoriſed, then
becauſe it is forbidden to be ſpoken of
on paine of death. Their vſurpation
vpon your Maieſties authoritie hath
no other footing, then the danger of
telling you freely of it. Conſider if
<pb facs="tcp:2705:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you pleaſe, Sir, that thoſe who vſurpe
this power ouer your Maieſtie, are of
that Countrey, where euery one will
Raigne, neither is there any towne on
that ſide the <hi>Alpes</hi> that hath not his
Republique or petty king: And if
your Maieſtie had ſomewhat yeerely
looked into your <hi>Hiſtorie,</hi> you would
haue learned, that the bloudieſt Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies
that euer haue been in France,
came from thoſe parts, the laſt furies
are the ſubiect of a little booke that I
publiſhed, of conſtancie and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
of publique calamities. I
feare, that contrary to my intent, it wil
be a worke for your Reigne, if God in
his goodnes haue not mercy vpon vs.
Thinke not, Sir, that ſorrow to ſee my
ſelfe depriued of emploiments, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
me to ſpeake ſo boldly. If I had
beene grieued for it, it is like married
people, that weepe when they muſt
go from their parents power, to enter
into the equalitie of Marriage: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
it is true, that owing my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
<pb facs="tcp:2705:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vnto your Maieſty, I ſhould haue
receiued greater content to haue em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
it in your Councell of State
then in your Parliament, where mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are of leſſe importance. For I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that if the Carpenter who made
the caruing worke for the Admirall,
where <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at the Battell of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> had
knowne that it ſhould haue ſerued for
ſo important an occaſion, whereon
depended the ſafety of the reſt of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
he would haue taken more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in making of it, then if it had been
a Veſſell ordained for commers.
Notwithſtanding ſeeing your Maieſty
commandeth me to retire, in a good
houre be it. The leſſer Starres are part
of the perfection of the world, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they do contribute leſſe then
doth the Sunne and Moone. In what
condition ſoeuer I liue, I will alwaies
to the vttermoſt of my power, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the good of your Maieſties ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.
But if there be any of thoſe who
<pb facs="tcp:2705:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are neere you, that lament my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue,
for my ſake: I will tell them
freely, Weepe for your Children of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
that for want of courage ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
your Maſter to be betrayed, and
not for me, that haue not offended,
vnleſſe, in being an honeſt Man.
Wherefore I take my leaue of you,
Sir, praying God that he will haue
pittie of your State, and
care of your edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>

all acceſſe vnto your Perſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

diſcouer the cauſes, and propound the

beſeech your Maieſtie to take in good

which cannot but well befit
their mouthes, ſithence it doth teſtifie
nothing but fidelitie and affection vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your ſeruice, to the conſeruation of
your Sacred Perſon, and the good of
your States. And it is by ſo much the
more conuenient, becauſe they are
thereunto obliged, both by Diuine
and Humane Lawes, by the Oath
which they haue taken, and the dutie
which they owe vnto your Crowne.
We are not ignorant, that the euill is
diſguiſed by thoſe who doe it, and
who labour by all poſſible meanes to
couer it, as well as commit it, ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuouring

ſeruants for Enemies. But the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of their Tyrannicall carriage is
growne to that exceſſe, that it cannot

mouing your compaſſion to releeue

his Wife is the only cauſe of the euils

            <p>This is the vlcer which hath feſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
yea, ſpoyled the whole body of

            <p>This is the complaint of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt

haue true French hearts: who ſeeing
themſelues compaſſed about with

and for to free your Crowne
from the many diſaſters, which now

            <p>The remedy <hi>(SIR)</hi> is in your own

to giue way vnto Iuſtice, that it may

and Charges, your Fauours, and
Pardons; becauſe hee would bee the
ſole Iudge of Honours, and Dignities,

diſcord betweene them, are not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne;

impriſon your chiefe Officers, and

Deſſignes, ſeeing that, through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme

violated the publike faith of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of <hi>Loudun;</hi> vpon the obſeruation
of which did depend the repoſe and
tranquillity of your State, which he
had rather plunge into the calamities
of a Warre, then to haue the maske

and vſeth it as an Inſtrument, for the
deſtruction of your moſt faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are ſo manifeſt, &amp; his

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2705:17"/>

            <p>Hee complaineth of ſome iniurie
done him by one of his Tenants; and
that in contempt of the dignity of his
Office, he cannot freely exerciſe his

            <p>He hath proſecuted an execution
of ſome feodal rights within his owne

<pb facs="tcp:2705:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Iuſtice, as vnwilling to loſe that which

defence and keeping of them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

            <p>Theſe lawfull and neceſſary cauſes
are wreſted to his rebuke; nay, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to him as a haynous crime and
Rebellion.</p>
            <p>We haue ſeen the Declaration that
hath bin publiſhed againſt him, vnder

trampling thus inſolently on the

in his hands the firſt Prince of
your Bloud, treading vnder foot both
Lawes and Magiſtrates, emptying
your Coffers by his profuſions, conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
your people with exceſſiue
charges, and cauſing your Subiects to
be trecherouſly murthered, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

their Age, their Vertue, and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts
