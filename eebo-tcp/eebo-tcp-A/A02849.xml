            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO
THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S Contemplation
in generall, is a
pure act of the
soule; so contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of diuine
things, is most proper vnto it.
This is the heauenly <hi>Manna,</hi>
whereon it feedeth; heereby it
groweth, heereby it is loosened
from the knots of flesh &amp; blood;
heereby it mounteth aboue the
narrow confines and limits, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the sordide things of this
<pb facs="tcp:27770:4"/>
world, aboue either the threats
or promises thereof; and both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth
to the originall from
whence it came, and applieth it
selfe to the end whither with
swift celerity it paceth. And
this is an inuincible argument
of the diuine nature of the soule,
if it takes delight in matters di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine;
if it be busied therein, not as
in other mens affaires, but as in
the owne. Assuredly, in nothing
else <hi>man</hi> is so much <hi>man,</hi> as
in contemplation of heauenly
things. Oh! how contemptible
a thing is <hi>man,</hi> if hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanceth
not aboue humane cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:27770:4"/>
But conceiue heere with (gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Reader) that contemplation
is but a fruitlesse action of the
soule, vnlesse it be thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
to loue. Contemplation
is a worke of the vnderstanding,
&amp; hath no perfection in it selfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but is a way and meanes to some
degree of perfection, by eleuating
the will to a diuine loue and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with <hi>GOD.</hi> The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
giueth not foode to
the soule, but prepareth it onely
for the taste of the will. <hi>Good</hi>
is the proper obiect of the will.
And therefore when the will fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
an infinite depth of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in <hi>GOD,</hi> it shalbe excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:27770:5"/>
icie, if it burne not like a
Phoenix, in the fire of diuine loue,
which by contemplation is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
kindled. Wherefore, if thou
wilt contemplate sweetely and
profitably, erect the forces of thy
will, to loue that which thou doest
vnderstand: for otherwise, thou
shalt bee but a cold and curious
speculator; thou shalt neuer ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue
at the true end of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.
For the end of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating
is not in speculation of
the vnderstanding, but in an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
loue of the will.</p>
            <p>Now because of all diuine
things none is more Noble then
the worke of our redemption;
<pb facs="tcp:27770:5"/>
none wherein GOD so much ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
his goodnesse, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
none so fit to enflame
our loue: I haue addressed my
Sabbaoth exercises this present
yere, to this prayer of CHRIST
vpon the Crosse for his enemies.
Hoping notwithstanding, that
the residue of the penitentiall
Psalmes, not yet comprised in
my <hi>Dauids Teares,</hi> shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
bee in the like manner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted;
either by my selfe (if
life continue) or by some other
more happie and industrious
hand.</p>
            <p>Assuredly, man is too <hi>mortall,</hi>
either to handle or to knowe
<pb facs="tcp:27770:6"/>
things <hi>immortall:</hi> As <hi>wee
know but in part,</hi> so wee can
expresse but a part of what wee
know; and must haue many part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in our labours therein. A
man should so endeauour to liue,
as he may doe good to all: But
if that cannot bee, yet to many:
and if not that, yet to some: and
if not that, at least to himselfe.
My desire hereby is to doe good
to all; euen to him, whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frict
malice hath much wronged
both me and himselfe; in case he
hath either conscience or shame
to bee wounded by a lasting me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of his dishonest dealings.</p>
            <p>But albeit, I esteeme both
<pb facs="tcp:27770:6"/>
these to bee almost impossible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like;
yet I make no doubt, but
hereby I shall doe good to many:
and the rather, because manie
haue acknowledged to mee great
good, which they haue receiued
by my former writings in this
kinde. But as in the same
meddow, the oxe seeketh grasse,
the hound a hare, and the storke
a lizard: so I expect that in this
worke some will hunt after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
some after cauils; but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wil find good pasture for their
soules. Of these I expect no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
recompence, but their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for mee; of which I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
I stand much in need.</p>

sacrificing of his life; consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
seriously (O my soule)
what he did, what he said, in
what thoughts he was busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
First consider his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:27770:12"/>
torments, in that
he was depriued of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts;
both <hi>externall</hi> from
others, and <hi>internall</hi> within
himselfe. If he stirred any
part of his body, his wounds
were thereby made more
grieuous. If hee remained
quiet, besides that immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
is a terrible torment,
one of the torments of hel<note n="*" place="margin">Bind him hand and foote, and cast him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vtter darkenesse.</note>;
the very weight of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
did teare his wounds wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Then consider how
in those extremities, the first
time he opened his lips, the
first voyce which his tongue
did forme, was in making in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession
for his enemies:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:27770:13"/>
               <hi>Father forgiue them, for they
know not what they doe.</hi> They
mocked, reuiled, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
but hee prayed: the
more they burned in hate,
the more was hee enflamed
with loue. <hi>Out of the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of the heart the mouth
speaketh:</hi> and from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance
of his loue did
this prayer proceed.</p>
            <p>But thinke not (O my
soule) that these were all the
words which IESVS spake,
that this was all his prayer
at large; but rather a sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary

with strong crying and teares.</hi>
And therfore when he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
silent, when his voyce
was not heard, when happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
his lippes did not moue;
whilest the Iewes were busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

(O my soule) that thy

was wholy attentiue in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his heauenly <hi>Father:</hi>
for them, for thee, and for all
sinners. And so, his members
being strongly streyned vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

made such tunable harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,

               <p>O Most iust, most mercifull,<note place="margin">His praying.</note>
most holy Father! thou
seest what a weighty worke I
haue begun: and now I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into two of my great offices.
The office of a Priest, as well in
offering my body for a sacrifice,
as in making supplications for
the people: and the office of an
Aduocate; in pleading the cause
of sinners before thee. In both
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:27770:14"/>
these heare me, I pray thee. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Father, load this bruised
body of mine with thy stripes;
powre foorth the full measure of
thy wrath vpon it: I am ready
to indure whatsoeuer charge it
shall please thee to impose. But
forgiue them, I beseech thee, for
whom I thus suffer. Let mee
not in this cruell maner lose my
blood, and lose them also for
whom I expend it: the price be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
paied, suffer me, I pray thee,
to enioy my purchase.</p>
               <p>O my eternall Father! In
recompence of my obedience to
thy will, in recompence of my
comming into the world to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
it to thee, in recompence
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:27770:15"/>
of all my trauailes ouer-paced, in
recompence of my present tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and death: I intreat no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of thee, but that thou wilt
pardon these mercilesse sinners.
I am well content that thou
wouldest not yeelde to my natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
desire when I prayed for my
selfe, that this cup might passe
from me; but denie mee not (I
pray thee) in praying for these.
For I esteeme the benefit grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that they be forgiuen, then
that this cup should haue passed
from me; I regard more the
good that they liue eternally,
then I regard the hurt that for
the present I die. O my good
Father! there is a time to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:27770:15"/>
and a time to punish: but
if euer there be a time to pardon,
it is now. Euen now, when I aske
forgiuenes at the very end of
my life; now whilest my blood
freshly runneth for forgiuenes,
whilest the sacrifice is in offring,
for which thou shouldest forgiue.
For now thou doest publikly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
thy pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: mercy &amp; truth,
iustice &amp; peace, do now embrace,
and kisse kindly together. Thou
didst once forgiue the Israelites,
O my Father! when <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>Aaron</hi> offered a little incense
for them; and wilt thou not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
these for whom I wholly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
my selfe? Thou didst once
grant victory when <hi>Moses</hi> held
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:27770:16"/>
vp his hands vnto thee; and
wilt thou nothing regard the
stretching foorth of my bleeding
hands? Father! I am come into
the world, I now suffer death in
the world to appease thine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
but what profit will ensue of
my comming and of my death, if
men should be still charged with
thy hate? If my death cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease
thy wrath, what then can
doe it? What then can make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement
betweene thee and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?
O my good Father! when
I came into the world by thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
when by thy appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I vndertooke to die: thou
diddest promise that thy wrath
should bee extinguished by my
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:27770:16"/>
death; that thy wrath and my
life should determine together.
Wherefore to discharge thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and because my life is more
precious to thee then thy wrath;
forgiue, I pray thee, and bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased.
Loe heere I set my selfe
in the breach;<note place="margin">Ezek. 22.</note> loe heere I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
betweene sinners and thee.</p>
               <p>BVT, O great Mediator!
wherfore doest thou so
earnestly entreat for sinners?
What ease is this to thy tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
what good to thy
selfe? In case thou wilt not
reuenge thy wrongs, yet
wherefore doest thou not
leaue them to thy fathers
pleasure? wherefore should
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:27770:17"/>
not Iustice run her course?
The Law sayth, <hi>Eie for eie,
hand for hand, life for life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
And what auayleth it thee,
that these offendours must
now be forgiuen?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O! YES:</hi> I am well content
O my Father! that thou load me
with thine anger, in what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
thou thinkest fit: but so, as
nothing may remaine vnrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to thee; so as my redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may not bee imperfect and
maimed: so as there may remaine
in man no fault to bee redeemed,
and in thee no anger to bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased.
O good Father! Charge
me freely (I say) with thy stripes,
set them so surely and seuerely as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:27770:17"/>
thou wilt: but suffer not my suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
to bee vnfruitfull; doe
not double my griefe, by causing
me to lose the benefit of my grief.
For it would be a greater griefe
to mee that these sinners should
perish, then are all the torments
where with they teare mee: euen
as a louing mother sorroweth
more at the losse of her childe,
then she did at her trauailes for
his birth. By suffering and by
pardoning the redemption of the
world must bee wrought: and
therefore pardon them, O good
Father! For whom I suffer;
or else no redemption can follow.
And if the death which now I
suffer, if the life which now I
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:27770:18"/>
                  <hi>offer</hi> bee not sufficient, I will

I am so farre from desiring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
that the more earnestly
they endeauour with many tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to destroy mee; the more
earnest am I, both in praying and
pleading for their saluation. For
alas! they are ignorant; I pitie
them with my heart, and from
my heart desire thee to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
for them. Giue them
time and meanes to bee instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
open their vnderstanding
to know mee, and to know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:
but as the case now stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
forgiue them, I pray thee;

the wrong, at whose suit will thy
iustice prosecute? What hath
Iustice to doe when no man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines?
Thou knowest right
well, that nothing can bee ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
an iniurie, which is not done
against our will. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I willingly suffer, and that
in obedience to thy will and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
to performe a most
necessary worke for the world:
remaine not thou displeased with
those, by whose hands my owne
will is performed, and this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:27770:19"/>
great worke accomplished.</p>
               <p>BVT happily it may bee
said,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> that as this action in it
selfe is the most heinous sin
that euer was committed;
so are these, in regard of
themselues, the most vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

               <p>Be it so.<note place="margin">Answ.</note> But O holy Father! Do
I die only for small offenders? is
not my death sufficient for all?
Doe I die for any other end, but
that all offenders may bee forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen?
And wilt not thou regard
more my sufferings, then any
mans sinnes? more my charitie
in dying for my tormentors, then
their malice iu putting mee to
death? It is true indeed, that if
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:27770:20"/>
thou wilt punish them according

but therefore it is better
freely to forgiue them. For as
there was neuer sinne compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

haue the like occasion to manifest
thy mercy. O my Father! see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my blood is shed by thy will,
imploy the same to the best ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
let not any man be depriud

For the greater offenders thou

Thy smart, thy faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

in hand to kill thee: they
will not returne into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

Albeit thou haddest

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:27770:26"/>

O blessed SAVIOVR!
when thou wert on the
Crosse all things forsooke
thee,<note place="margin">The patience and loue of CHRIST.</note> except onely thy pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and thy loue. By thy
patience thou didst endure
all extremities of torments;
by thy loue thou didst offer
vp supplications with strong
cryings and teares. The
Iewes prouoked thy Father
to take vengeance vpon
them, in saying, <hi>His blood bee
vpon vs:</hi> but thou didst
pray him to remit that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
because thy blood
was shed for them. They
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:27770:26"/>
caried thee before the high

haue thee condemned; but
thou didst present them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thy Father, that they
might bee pardoned. They
cried against thee, <hi>Let him be
crucified;</hi> but thou prayedst
for them, <hi>Father forgiue them.</hi>
Certainly, O my SAVIOVR!
It is so great a mysterie that
thou didst pray for those
who did blaspheme thee;
that thou didst pardon those
who tormented thee to
death, without sorow, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
intreatie; and that thy

               <p>By this strong crying thou

a most forcible affection,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:27770:29"/>
with deepe groanes, with a
violent intention of desire

hee is saide to pray aloude,
whose soule is fired with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent

whose thoughts are neither
distracted nor remisse, but

There is no strong crying to

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:27770:30"/>
either of loue or of

most forcible in our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOVR
vpon the Crosse.
Loue, for <hi>compasion</hi> towards
others; griefe, for the <hi>passion</hi>
which hee felt in himselfe.
He was enflamed to loue, by
his mysticall members; his
naturall members enforced
him to griefe. From this
loue and this griefe his crie
must needes bee exceeding
strong. And besides; it must
bee a violent voyce that was
heard for all men; that did
silence and drowne the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of all sinnes. For it was
not for his tormentors only,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:27770:30"/>
but it was for all men that

what earthy spirit would

once to smite thy Fathers
cares with thy prayers, and
to mollifie his heart with thy

Redeemer! Albeit thou didst
pray to thy Father for the

demanded of him; yet if
thou hadst desired a greater,
thy blood was so abundant,
thy cries so strong, thy teares
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:27770:31"/>

               <p>FIRST he began with the
sweet word FATHER.
Hee did not terme him
LORD; for that was a name
of seuerity and iustice; but
FATHER, which is a name
of pity and mercy. If he had
sayd, LORD, forgiue them,
as Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> prayed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
it might haue seemed
that hee had referred their
pardon to the curtesie and
iudgement of iustice. But
FATHER is a name of
compassion, a name of the

which by the blood and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits

of our IESVS, we may
challenge to vse towardes
hm. That, as he pleased
to bee our brother: so hee
would thereby make vs the
sonnes of his FATHER. And
therefore hee vsed the same
worde in praying for vs,
which hee did in praying
for himselfe: For as he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for himselfe; <hi>Father into
thy hands I commit my spirit:</hi>
so he prayed for vs; <hi>Father
forgiue them.</hi> As if he should
haue said:</p>
               <p>O my Father! acknowledge
me now for thy Sonne, thy onely
Sonne, thy Sonne in whom thou
art well pleased, thy Sonne to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:27770:34"/>
whom thou wilt denie nothing:
for as I am obedient to thee, as
to my Father; so I expect to bee
heard of thee, as thy Sonne.
Father, I am therefore come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this world, that sinners also
should be receiued for thy sonnes;
and therefore heare mee now in
praying for them. If euer thou
wilt heare them praying to thee
in my Name, heare now my
owne prayer for them. So deare
a Sonne as I am to thee; so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable

If thou hearest not the prayers of

endure to abolish a greater euill:
that is, to appease thy wrath, and
to make sinners accepted for thy

hee cryed, not onelie as a
Priest, but as a sacrifice;
which neuer demandeth
free forgiuenesse, but brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
satisfaction with it.
And not only he cried with
his mouth;<note place="margin">With how many mouthes CHRIST craued for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse.</note> but his wounds
cryed, his blood cryed, his

Wee giue thee blood and smarte

Let there now bee <hi>mercy with
thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 130.</note> for this is <hi>a plenteous

namely, that a most indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent

forget the cruell death of his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:27770:36"/>
demands it: he demands it with

all his sufferings he demands it.</p>
               <p>Not vnder any condition,<note place="margin">Not conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally but absolutely.</note>
as hee prayed for himselfe in the

positiuely and absolutely he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
thee to <hi>Forgiue.</hi> His owne

thy pardon hee doth absolutely
intreat. He put it to thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
whether hee should die or
no; but he leaueth no consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
no choice for thy granting of
forgiuenesse: his prayer for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse
is so absolute, as it
may not be denied.</p>
               <p>Hereby thou mayest
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:27770:37"/>
learne (O my soule!) that
remission of sinnes, and all
diuine graces are to be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of GOD without condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
because this prayer is
alwayes referred to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of GOD. Also, that
whensoeuer thou forgiuest
thy enemies, thou doe it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely,
without reseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Neuer accompt it a
Christian forgiuenes, when
it is with exception; that
thou wilt not speake to him,
that thou wilt not conuerse
&amp; be familiar with him. For
thy SAVIOVR did not pray
for his enemies vpon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or in part: hee prayed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:27770:37"/>
absolutely for all, and for all
offences of euery one. GOD
also is so noble in pardoning,
that hee cannot forgiue one
sinne, either alone, or in part:
hee neuer pardoneth to
halfes; he cannot but either
wholly pardon, or wholly
punish: If any one sinne be
vnpardoned, the sinner must
be charged with all. O gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
IESV! thou didst abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
pray for all sinners,
and therewith offer thy
blood, as a sufficient ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
for all sinnes: For all
sinnes might bee numbred,
but thy precious blood
could not be valued.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:27770:38"/>
And it was not onely
<hi>absolutely,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Presently.</note> that thou diddest
pray to thy Father, but also
that hee would <hi>presently</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue:

giue day, it must bee foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with:
<hi>remission</hi> must bee

Thou wert then neere the
point of thy death: but thou
wouldest not die vntill par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
was granted: thou
wouldest not make paiment
of all thy blood, vntill thou
hadst thy bargaine in hand;
vntill peace were composed
betweene GOD and Man.
Thou art not like many
worldly Parents, who leaue
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:27770:38"/>
small inheritances to their

times with debts, suits, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
incumbrances: but for
the heauenly inheritance
which thou hast giuen vs,
thou hast made ready pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
cleared all reckonings,
remooued all difficulties and
charges, and concluded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
peace with thy Father
before thy death; saying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, FORGIVE! and
that presently, O my Father!
for euen now is the time ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued
to forgiue. This is the
houre of sacrifice, the day of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
the day of remission,
I am euen now readie to lay
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:27770:39"/>
downe my life, and I make

to thee shall bee this; <hi>FATHER
forgiue.</hi> O heauenly <hi>FATHER,</hi>
as thou louest thy Sonne, so
hold him no longer in torments;
for I must not die vntill thou
forgiue.</p>
               <p>Neither did hee pray to
the Father to forgiue the
sinnes only which then had
been committed,<note place="margin">For all sinnes past, present, and to come.</note> but simply
to <hi>forgiue;</hi> euen those sinnes
also which afterward should
be committed. For his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuters
had not then satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselues with blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
and scornes; they had
not then offered him a

spunge dipped in vineger;
they had not then opened
his side with a speare; they
had not then feasted their
eyes with sight of his dead
bodie: and yet he prayed as
well for these as for all the
cruelties which before they
had done: Yea, for all sinnes,
not onely past and present,
but to ensue, hee powred
foorth this prayer; <hi>Father

sacrifice, but prayer: hee
was not onely a sacrificer,
but an intercessour for the

               <p>Which example if thou

If thou wilt regard more the

euery action; if thou
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:27770:42"/>
wilt (which is a property of
GOD) draw good out of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill;
thou shalt neuer hate
any enemie, but rather loue
him for the good that hee
worketh. A great mans son
will wel endure to be taught
and reproued by his school<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master:
But there is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
schoolemaster then an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie;
who beareth an eie
ouer thy actions, and wilbe
nimble to reprooue thy
faults. If thou wouldest
liue warilie and in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
pray to GOD to send
thee an enemie, and thou
shalt need no schoolemaster;
hee will spare thee that sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:27770:43"/>
An enemie is the
bridle, a friend is the couer
of sinne. Friends puffe vs
vp; but enemies humble vs,
and make vs vigilant and
wise. Hee who hateth his
enemie, striketh one that is
sicke; killeth a dying man.
Triacle is made of poison.
Take the malice of thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
temper it with loue to

thou makest an excellent

               <p>BVT O gracious Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our!
who were they for
whom thou diddest pray?
what <hi>them</hi> didst thou meane?
what <hi>them</hi> wouldest thou
haue forgiuen? were they
thy cruell crucifiers? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
then diddest thou not
terme them bloodsuckers,
paricides, sacrilegious hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
or whatsoeuer other
name either cruelty or impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
could deserue? For two
especiall causes. One, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
vs, that wee abstaine
from reprochfull speeches;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:27770:44"/>
The other to declare, that he
esteemed no man to bee his
enemy. Vndoubtedly, the
Sonne of GOD did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
his executioners for
his enemies, but for his
friends, for his brethren, for
his owne flesh and blood:
and therefore hee preached
vnto them during his life,
and at his death prayed for
them. They hated him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
but in so doing, they
hated the most louing friend
they had in the world: one
who could not bee angrie
with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whose loue could
not be, either withdrawne,
or abated from working
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:27770:44"/>
their good. In case he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked
any thing they did, it
was not in regard of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
but of his FATHER: and
therefore he prayed his FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER
to forgiue them. He
who was nothing offended
with iniuries against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
as regardlesse both of
torment and scorne; was
most sensible of the iniuries
and despite which reached
to his FATHER: not to haue
them punished, but forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
               <p>Also he vsed the generall
word <hi>them,</hi> not onely for
<hi>them,</hi> who were the present
actors of his death; but for
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:27770:45"/>
all <hi>them</hi> besides, who by their
sins gaue cause to his death.
And thou, O my soule, art
included in this prayer,
whose sinnes also are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the cause of his death.
Thou hast thy part in his
prayer, thy part in his remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
especially if thou ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne
thy prayer with his.
For if his prayer was profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to <hi>them,</hi> who neither
prayed with him, nor intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him to pray for them; it
will bee profitable for thee,
in case thou doest both. For
verily his prayer was profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to those who desired
no pardon, who did abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:27770:45"/>
refuse it. For how
could they desire to bee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
who would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that they did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend?
who cast all the blame
vpon IESVS? who held
him to haue deserued worse
then he suffered? Those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
Iewes were so
farre out of their wits, that
they did not onely forbeare
to aske pardon for their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
but repelled pardon
so much: as they could: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not onely not sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for the mischiefes they
did, but grieued because they
could doe no more. They
were not content to goe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:27770:46"/>
without pardon, but they
demanded vengeance for
that which they did: <hi>His
blood be vpon vs, and vpon our
children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O sottish Synagogue!
wherefore doest thou desire
that the blood of CHRIST,
appointed to redeeme thee,
should bee turned to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
thee? O vnfortunate
Iewes! O cursed people! if
the Sonne of GOD had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
your demand. But
hee appealed from it, hee
would not consent to your
reprobate request: he would
in no case consent, that his
blood should be shed against
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:27770:46"/>
you, but for you. You cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vpon you the most cruell
curse that could bee; <hi>his
blood be vpon vs;</hi> but he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
it with his merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

pardon him if hee repent;

them, who would not
be pardoned, who despised

was it not sufficient, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

then was the worke of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The reason is plaine:
Because there is not so great

a distance betweene <hi>nothing</hi>

infinitely. And therefore
GOD produced <hi>all things</hi> out
of <hi>nothing,</hi> only by his word:
but to reduce sinners to

were required. To teach

to appease thy Fathers

death. Behold my <hi>Priest,</hi>
who need not bee sprinkled
or sanctified with other
blood, but gloriously gliste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in his owne. Behold,
my pleasing and perfect <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice;</hi>
odoriferous and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to thee. Behold my
<hi>Aduocate</hi> whome I haue dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to plead my cause be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee. Heare him, I
pray thee, and regard the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
that hourely hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
for me. Grant, O piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
FATHER! that I may
alwayes haue him for my
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:27770:72"/>
                  <hi>Aduocate,</hi> whom by no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of mine, but by thy pure
grace thou hast giuen for
my Redeemer.</p>
               <p>O omnipotent FATHER of
my LORD! what I could find
most precious, most highly
to bee esteemed, I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly
presented to thee:
<hi>Compose</hi> thy selfe now, to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi>
thy grace and mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
mee. And albeit I
am vnworthy of thy rich fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
in regard of my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
yet remember thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
remember thy promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
remember the inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
merits of my Redeemer:
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:27770:73"/>
remember what hee hath
done, and what he hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
euen from his Cratch
to his Crosse; not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
but for me. All which
I heere offer to thee, most
gentle FATHER! as a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
for my sinnes, and
for all my necessities:
for whatsoeuer I require of
thee, it is in his name, and
for his sake; it is for the loue
thou bearest to him, and for
the loue that hee beareth to
thee.</p>
               <p>Thou hast promised to
honour fathers in their sons,
and sonnes for their fathers.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:27770:73"/>
O fauourable LORD! honor
now thy onely Sonne, by
doing good to moe, for the
loue thou bearest to him.
For he is my FATHER, my
second <hi>Adam;</hi> and I am his
sonne, albeit vndutifull; yet
because, in trueth, I am his
sonne; for the loue thou bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
to him, be fauourable to
mee. For assuredly, he hath
payd for mee much more
then I owe. No offence can
bee so grieuous, for which
his sorrowes, his sufferings,
his obedience, and aboue all
his profuse loue, hath not
amply satisfied: which his
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:27770:74"/>
large riuers of blood cannot
wash away; which may not
bee drowned and deuoured
in his death.</p>
               <p>O heauenly FATHER!
there is nothing in my selfe,
which I dare presume to
present vnto thee. For what
can proceed from this cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is not noisome?
what fruit canst thou expect
from this earth, which thou
hast cursed from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
but thornes and briers?
And therfore I offer this my
SAVIOVR and Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
thy most blessed Son;
and the vnmeasurable loue
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:27770:74"/>
whereby thou didst send
him into the world, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled
with my flesh, to free
mee thereby from eternall
death. Beseeching thee, to
accept his humble and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
prayers, for my dry and
dull deuotions. Accept his
teares, for the torrent of
teares which I should powre
foorth; but by reason of the
hardnesse of my heart, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.
Accept his incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
dolours and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which thou onelie
perfectly knowest; for the
sorrow &amp; contritio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which I
am bound to performe. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:27770:75"/>
accept his sharpe and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurious
life, with all his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes
and exercises of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
accept his cruell death,
and all his passions, as a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to thy glorious Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty;
for all the euill workes
which I haue done, and for
all the good workes which I
should haue done.</p>
               <p>Feede mee with his flesh,
inebriate me with his blood:
let his griefe enter into my
soule, that I may bee resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
wholly into his loue.
Away all forraine loues; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with the multitude of
worldly phantasies and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:27770:75"/>
dreames: let me be crucified
with him to the world; let
me so die with him, that my
life may bee layde vp in thy
diuine treasury. Thy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
compareth all worldlie
things to <hi>dung:</hi> and may bee
likened to the swallowes
dung,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> which fell vpon the
eyes of <hi>Tobias,</hi> and made him
blinde. For we cannot see
spirituall things, so long as
our eyes are daubed with

               <p>O my life! O desire of
my soule! hide mee from
the world; obscure me from
the fawning fauours there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and take me into the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret

to dwel. <hi>One thing is necessary;</hi>
and that doe I desire. <hi>My

                  <note place="margin">Cant. 6.</note> My CHRIST
IESVS, my GOD, my spouse
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:27770:76"/>

                  <note place="margin">Cant. 6.</note> Let mee neither
