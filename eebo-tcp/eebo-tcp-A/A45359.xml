            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>That there is in us a Principle of life and motion wholly independent upon matter, and which by an intrinſick vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue actuates this ſtupid and heavy body we carry about us; I think, there are few ſo groſs and ſenſual as to deny: At leaſt, if there be any ſuch, I ſhall not now concern my ſelfe with them, but take into conſideration that odd Hypotheſis which ſome have fallen upon, who fancy the ſoul (though diſtinct from the body) to fall into ſuch a profound ſleep, as never to be awakened but by that ſhril-ſounding Trump which ſhall eccho through the arched roof of Heaven, and rouz the dead from the ſilence of their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96883:3"/>
dormitories, to appear before the juſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of the Son of God. Which if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined to the bottom will prove little leſs than a piece of Epicuriſm and a branch of new—modell'd Atheiſm, to exclude and baniſh all hopes of a future reward in thoſe immortal regions of love and joy out of the minds and ſpirits of men. It will be neceſſary as well for the promoting of righteouſneſs and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as the diſcouraging vice and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, to ſhew the lubricous and brittle foundation upon which this doctrine is built.</p>
            <p>In order to which,<note place="margin">Argum. 1.</note> we may conſider the Soul of man as a ſpiritual Eſſence ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of acting and ſubſiſting (if God ſo pleaſe) after ſhe is diſengaged from this weight of dull mortality, to which by a vital harmony and eſſential congruity ſhe became at firſt united. Which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Craſis being worn out by the length of time, or diſcompoſed through the violence of a diſeaſe, or ſome other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered motions in the body, that ſweet Tye is preſently diſſolved and broken, and the Soul, freed from her terreſtrial pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becomes a denizon of another world. For, what cords or ſprings can retard a ſpirit? Or what walls can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96883:4"/>
and impriſon ſo ſubtil and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive a Being as the Soul of man? For, that the Soul at any time ſeparates from the body, is not from her own actual will, but from the vitiated temperament of the body ſhe is united with, which by harſh and uneven motions becomes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unpleaſant and diſharmonious to her inward ſenſe or plaſtick life, ſo that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once looſened from the body ſhe regains a vital energie or power far more vigorous than before, and attains to a clearer perception of things than when cloyſtred within theſe walls of fleſh. No law of Fate or Immutability, can ſtop her flight from the inſenſate Corps which is no longer in a capacity of entertaining it's departing Gueſt. So then, this ſleep of the ſoul muſt be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the ceſſation of her operations upon her diſunion with the body: For, Death, ſay they, quite obliterates and wipes off all thoſe various phantaſms with which the mind was ſtored here below: which being excited and ſtirred up in her by the preſence of their ſeveral objects, now that ſhe is diſpread and fallen back, as it were, into that univerſal Life, can never re-enter her knowledg, nor can ſhe be conſcious of ought, but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96883:4"/>
muſt lye thus ſenſeleſſe for ever, unleſs that benign Spirit which firſt brought her into Being, awaken her from this mortal Sleep.</p>
            <p>But he that ſhall conſider thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral powers and faculties the great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the World who made all things well, beſtowed upon the Soul of man; and how orderly in their due time and place they awaken into act, will be forced to confeſs, that Infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome has ſo happily contrived it, that ſhe ſhall never want proportionate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of action, whatſoever ſtate the various revolutions of an unerring Providence ſhall place her in. Thoſe clear eyes of Heaven and divine Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience foreſeeing all the poſſible fates of men, beheld them not only as being inhabitants of this terreſtrial World, but as thoſe that were not farr removed from the confines of eternity, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of dwelling in that Kingdome of light and glory which no mortal eye can behold and live, and to this end, endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with ſuch powers as ſhould make them happy both in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of themſelves and God, in that condition of Being wherein they are. While we are here in this Region of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96883:5"/>
mutability, we are in a ſtate of baniſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment from our native home, and the life of the body grown ſo powerful and vigorous that the gentle touches and ſoft vibrations of our more divine part are ſcarce perceptible within us: Thoſe fatal Inclinations which at firſt pent up our ſpirits which lay wide as the World, embracing the Creation in an extenſive love, and ſunk them down to a bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs indulgence and regard of ſenſe and corporal pleaſures, are now moſt lively and active, and the more near approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es we make to this muddy life, the more groſs and feculent are the apprehenſions and Idea's of our minds. The ſcorching flames of Envy and degenerate Malice dry up the gentle dews of heaven that enlarge and widen the ſoul with a divine fertility; the vile and impure motions of Luſt bemire the internal beauty of this Daughter of heaven; and every cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive affection captivates her to a new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented pleaſure, and a further deflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from her Original and Primitive good. This is the loweſt degree of life that is ſeated in the Soul of man, this is that pleaſing Magick which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witches and enchants the Mind with theſe poor and contemptible Goods:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96883:5"/>
Thus <hi>Adam</hi> loſt his Paradiſe by liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the charming voice of his new eſpouſed Bride; and thus we fell with him, and became mancipated and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved to the body; and that eternal Fire which was firſt kindled from heaven, ſenſibly decayed and vaniſhed, and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs took away the light of the day and hid the beams of truth and righteouſneſs from our eyes, leaving us wandring in a night of error, without any guide, ſave that now and then a ray of glory pierced through thoſe clammy miſts, and left an impreſſion upon us ſufficient to let us know that it ſprang from an heavenly ſource and fountain. But when the edge of this luxuriant principle ſhall be taken off, and men dye to their groſſer bodies, another and farr more ample degree of life ſhall awake in the Soul. For, there being in the ſpirit of man ſuch a gradual ſubordination of faculties and all ſo cloſely connected to their indiſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pible head and center, 'tis very natural to conceive, that, upon the extinction or ceſſation of a lower power, a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and enlarged Capacity ſhould ariſe and ſpring up in its room. Thus, Death being nothing but a Conſopition
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96883:6"/>
of ſome inferiour faculties, will be ſo farr from drawing over the whole man this benumming drouſineſs, that it will bring into play thoſe hidden powers, which like ſome keys in muſick lay dead and ſilent, till ſtruck by the careful hand of Nature to keep up that Vniverſal Harmony which the Eternal Mind wrought in the eſſential contexture of the Creation. All the powers of the Soul do not operate at once with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual degree of intenſeneſs and vigour, but, as the dull and heavy life of ſenſe and corporeity is emacerated by repeated acts of mortification, and made ſequaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and obedient to the dictates of the intellectual man, ſo the mind and divine life becomes more ſubtil and abſtracted from matter, aſſimilating its ſelf to that Holy One whoſe perfection it is, to be wholly ſpiritual and immaterial. And we our ſelves plainly perceive, that when the mind is bent and fully carried out upon the contemplation of an object, the external Senſe is very much debilitated and abated, ſo that the Vibrations of corporeal motion upon the Organs both of ſight and hearing are for a time ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended and unconcerned, which plainly inferrs that the Soul cannot attend to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96883:6"/>
two diſtinct powers at the ſame time in their higheſt actings and capacities, but that, as the operations of the one are brought low and decreaſe, ſo the other are invigorated and augmented. And who can rationally averr that the actings of the ſoul ſhall ceaſe when diveſted of theſe garments of mortality, ſince that there is a gradual declenſion &amp; derivation of all her powers from the perceptive part or firſt and primary ſubſtance of ſuch an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially-incorporate Spirit as the ſoul of man? For, the higher life contains and includes the lower, and ſtill as we aſcend upward life is more large and compleat till we arive at the higheſt of all: which whoever hath throughly awakened, is inſtalled in the greateſt Happineſs, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature is capable of; flying beyond the regions of death and diſſolution, and ſeated above the reach of envy and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, in the great diffuſions and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications of heavens glory and beatitude. All life is not deſtroyed at once, nor can the power of death and the grave exceed the diſſolution of the Souls vital con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity of actuating a terreſtrial body: whatever looks beyond this remains ſafe and ſecure as the laws of heaven; ſo that we need not fear, an eternal oblivion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96883:7"/>
ſhould creep upon us, or that we ſhould ſlide out of being when we ceaſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with men, and have our Aſhes crowded into their narrow urns. To carry on this Argument a little further, and to pleaſure and gratifie our fancies: we may conceive the Soul of man to be a Circle whoſe Center is that noble and divine part full of eſſential Intellect and perception; the Area, thoſe exterior branches or eſſential emanations from the firſt central power and activity, which deſcend <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by abatement from the Primary ſubſtance, the will and Reaſon being the neareſt the ſource of life and vigour, the Imagination a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree lower, from whence we go down to the Senſes which take cogniſance of external objects and make a true and faithful repreſentation of them in the ſeat of perception: and ſtill the further they are removed from their origin and Spring, the more ſtraitned and confined they grow till they arrive to the Periphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wihch is the Plaſtick and deepeſt or loweſt power, and the moſt narrow and contracted of all: Thus we ſee how all the powers of the ſoul lye in a natural graduality and ſubordination to the eye and Center of this little World, which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96883:7"/>
like the Sun, the bright Eye and Center of the world, fills the whole Aire with rayes of light, to its utmoſt confines and circumference. Having thus illuſtrated the Nature and Powers of the Soul, it's eaſie to imagine (ſhe not being an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, homogeneal Maſs like a lump of matter, but one part the gradual reſult and efflux of the other) that ſome vital congruity may be layed aſleep, and Death may cauſe a ceſſation of the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ſome faculties, without the total conſopition of the Soul.</p>
            <p>The Moral ſtate and condition of the ſoul after death is ſuch,<note place="margin">Argum. 2.</note> as to every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderative and ingenuous Spirit will give ſufficient ſecurity againſt thoſe irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fears of her Sleep and ſenſeleſneſs when ſhe has left the body.</p>
            <p>Though men here ſtrayed from God the fountain of their bliſs and happineſs, and defaced the beautiful Image of their Creator by a vigorous proſecution of the exorbitant motions and pleaſures of ſenſe, yet he regards and careth for them, remembers that his own good hands firſt gave them being, and pities the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy miſcarriage of ſo noble a part of his Creation. And therefore, as a tender Mother ſhoves off her prety infant from
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96883:8"/>
her that it may return again with freſh and more ardent embraces; ſo God the benign Father of Spirits is pleaſed for a while to baniſh his own dear Offspring into this region of mortality, that he may more endear them to himſelf, and enhance the price of heavenly joy, by begetting in them an impatient deſire and breathing after it. And to this end that All-compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive Wiſdome which made all things well, and fitted the capacities of his Creatures to thoſe ſeverall ſtates they were to run through, hath cloathed the ſouls of men with coats of skins, and made them inhabitants of the Earth; not that they ſhould make the Paternal bounty and indulgence of God an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a riotous licentiouſneſs, and take heart from his kindneſs to be the more vitious, but to curb their lawleſs wills, and reſtrain their irregular appetites, refine and purifie their minds and Spirits to a high degree of Generoſity, Sobriety and Goodneſs: For, in this life it is that men lay the Trains and Seeds of their future happineſs or miſery, and that juſt Nemeſis, which paſſes through the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and intereſtes it ſelf peculiarly in the affairs of rational Agents, will inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably ſeize on the Soul when departed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96883:8"/>
from her decayed tenement, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey her to that place and ſociety which the rectitude or obliquity of her moral Nature hath fitted her for. There are two oppoſite Principles or contrary Natures in the World, between which there is an eternall and irreconcilable Feud, <hi>viz.</hi> Sin &amp; Righteouſneſs; to one of which every man ioyns himſelf, and becomes a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a ſociety or body Politick; and carries on <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> an immortal warr, Sin is nothing but a deflection from the divine Nature, a tranſpoſition or undue connexion and diſ-harmonious union of ſome principles in the Creation, which raiſes a perturbation and diſorder in the Soul of man, and, when confirmed by repeated acts, becomes a habit, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſsates &amp; obnubilates the mind, crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into narrowneſs and ſervility: But righteouſneſs is a concord or agreement and ſuitableneſs with thoſe living laws impreſsed upon every moral agent, when the Soul acts adequately and conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to thoſe innate notions of truth and holineſs, and this enlarges and ſets free the Spirit of man from Tyranny and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. And hence it comes to paſs that the actions of men are not as the tranſient effects of neceſsary cauſes, as a ſtone to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96883:9"/>
fall downwards; but, being the reſults of ſpontaneous principles have a moral influence of good or evil upon their future ſtates and conditions: For, men arrive not to the utmoſt degrees and completion of goodneſs or iniquity in a moment; but, as in Naturals, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Morals there is a latitude required; and things aſcend gradually to their perfections: and conſequently the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or righteous Nature reſpectively dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preads it ſelf and incorporates and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns the Soul either with Hell or Heaven in this life. For Hell in a moral ſenſe is nothing but an Orbe of ſin and unrighteouſneſs, a ſtate of penury &amp; anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety, and ſucks in and draws, as it were with hidden cords and ſtrings, every thing that is like to it ſelf; ſo that every wicked man truly carries the beginnings of Hell and mi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The Spirit is ſaid to be in Hades becauſe it partakes of the dark nature and void of light. But Heaven is the region of ſerenity and quiet, a ſtate of righteou<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

own Nature, elevating and winding the ſpirits of men off from their commerce with vice, and the alluring objects of ſenſe, and transforming them into it's own beauteous Image and pulchritude; and the further they recede from the Cuſpis of the love of wickedneſs and the unrighteous Nature, the more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they find; and when once they are ſo farr riſen that the utmoſt projections of this dark ſhadow cannot touch them, then are they arrived to an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and boundleſs freedom.</p>
            <p>Every man therefore ſo fatally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning himſelf either to Heaven or Hell in this life, it will inevitably fall to his ſhare to be happy or miſerable when departed out of it; which cannot be, except the Memory and Senſe of his paſt actions return, upon his ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the body: And that it does ſo, is not only a probable but neceſſary conſequence from the Nature of the Soul: For, Memory being a radicated faculty of the Soul, and having no greater dependance upon the body than all other exertions and operations of the mind whatſoever, it will remain ſafe and entire, notwithſtanding the various turnings and transmutations of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96883:10"/>
corporeal principles: Indeed, were Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and thoſe other Faculties, which not without great reaſon we attribute to a knowing and intelligent Principle, the ſole effects of the re-action or tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulous motions of certain pieces of matter ſtriking upon each other; it were a neceſſary deduction from thence, that Death ſhould ſpoil their ſport and quite deface and obliterate whatever their nimble friskings and incertain agitations might repreſent unto us: but this is already ſufficiently demonſtrated to our hands, to be both frivolous and preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious by an excellent Perſon, who has diveſted Matter of all cogitative powers and properties. And if we well weigh the ſtate of the Soul after death, it will appear that Memory will then be more vivid and lively; and Conſcience, which is nothing but a reflexe act of Memory, more ſenſible and awakened: For the great cauſe of all our weak and imperfect actions in this life, is the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs and inobſequiouſneſs of matter to the powers of the Soul, whereby they become dull, languiſhing, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active; but when death ſhall give us entrance into another World, and the Soul united to a more ductil and pliable
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96883:10"/>
vehicle, her operations will become more ſprightly, and the Memory bring into view many and diverſe things which, before it was not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; &amp; the Conſcience afflict or cheer according to her deportment in the former life. Neither is this any more than what we find already in the natures and cauſes of things: For, if Memory being loſt by the violence of a diſeaſe or ſome other extraordinary indiſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body; yet returns and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained upon the ceſſation and amotion of the diſtemper, and reduction of the ſpirits to their priſtine temperament: I ſee no reaſon, why it ſhould thus to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally be deſpoiled by Death, there being oft-times a greater change and perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſome malignant diſeaſes, than we ſee happen to ſound and healthy perſons, whom the caſualties of Warr or other ſudden Fate hath brought to an untimely end. This only difference is aſſigned (which yet when ſeverely examined carries no great moment with it) that when Nature or Art hath expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the morbifick matter, and reſtored the body to a healthfull vigour, and the ſpirits depurated and rectified from their vitioſity, become accommodate
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96883:11"/>
inſtruments for the operations of the Soul, her vital union with matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, which in Death (ſay they) is totally loſt and diſſolved; and how the Soul unbared from all commerce with matter can be capable of acting, ſeems utterly unintelligible: Whether there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Soul does, or does not act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of matter, when her gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of mortality are laid aſide, is not my preſent purpoſe to diſcuſs: Only I ſhall caſt in this by the way, that no man can be demonſtratively certain that the Soul cannot act without the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of matter, but if he remind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of that intimate dependance the Soul hath upon matter in this life even in her ſublimeſt exerciſes, (for I omit here the power of moving the body, which is likewiſe performed by the motion of matter directed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will and pleaſure of the Soul) as alſo her ſympathy with the mutations and alterations of the Air, whereby the mind becomes more ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and ſerene, or cloudy and dull, and thoſe infinite varieties likewiſe which a man may obſerve in his own temper and conſtitution, not to inſtance in any other but thoſe of an extraordinary joy

God. Suppoſing then the Soul vitally united with matter after death, ſhe will both act, and alſo be capable of pleaſure or pain, which are the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable concomitants of her tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions in this life: For, can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that God will put a ſtop to the courſe of Nature, and alter that order and conſtitution of things which bears upon it the ſignature and Image of his eternal Wiſdome? Surely, it cannot be that he ſhould fruſtrate the hopes and expectations of men, when all things ſo favourably conſpire to give them an energetical and vital reception into the other World. And if God do not drench the Souls of men in this lake of oblivion and ſoporiferouſneſs (which we have all the reaſon in the world to believe, and ought to be confident that he will not) they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly be inſtated, upon their dereliction of their earthly bodies, into a condition of happineſs or miſery, which will altogether take away that fanciful dream of their ſleep till the great day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For, although here the voice of Conſcience may be drowned by the clamours of Senſe, and thoſe many Diverſions ariſing from the preſent
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96883:12"/>
ſtate of affairs in this life; yet, when death ſhall draw aſide the curtain of mortality; and thoſe various objects, which ſo often preſented themſelves to our view, paſs away like a ſhadow, leaving nothing to the Soul but the vaſt proſpect of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Tragedy; the conſcience will then awake, and pierce her with an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary reſentment and vexation: For, beſides that the Soul ſhall ſee all her wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked attempts and deſigns blaſted upon Earth, the memory of her name curſed and deteſted, and become throughly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of the miſcarriage and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her paſt life, and have a full and clear ſight of all her impious actions, ſtript of their painted gloſs and varniſh, &amp; in their proper colours and genuine circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; beſides this, I ſay, the Fame of her unrighteous demeanour will go before her into the other World, and quickly be diſpread over the ſecret regions and receptacles of Spirits, by thoſe vigilant ſpectators, who take cognizance and give intelligence of humane affairs: which cannot but afflict her even unto death, to ſee her ſelf abandon'd both of good Angels, and the ſpirits of juſt and holy men, and confined to the ſociety of degenerate Fiends and Daemons

And theſe fiery ſtings and gripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of conſcience ſhall rage perpetually, and, if we can imagine any intermiſſion, it will be but like the ſleeps of the wind in a ſtorm, or the broken ſighs of a tempeſt, to recover its exhauſted ſpirits, and return with a greater impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs and fury. But to take a view of thoſe good and holy perſons whom the Father of ſpirits has called out of this preſent life, who yet are in as ſmall a probability of being overtaken by this long night as the other, there wants not ſufficient employment to keep them vigilant and active: For, whether it be that they delight in converſe and ſociety, they will find thoſe immenſe tracts of ſpace, not empty deſarts and wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, but repleniſhed with diverſe ſorts of Beings, ſome equal to, others more noble than themſelves, who all ſtudiouſly endeavour to promote and carry on that great and general deſign of the diffuſion of the Life and Nature of God over the whole Creation; they may there likewiſe meet with many of their departed Friends and Relatives, with whom they may again renew their antient leagues of friendſhip, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96883:13"/>
entertain an amicable correſpondence and familiarity: or, whether they be contemplative, and affect a ſolitary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiredneſs and receſs from the reſt of the World, they may there call to mind their almoſt obliterate Speculations, and pleaſe themſelves in the exertions of the innate Idea's and notions of their minds, and raiſe within them a high ſenſe of joy and delectation in finding out many choiſe Theorems of Nature and Providence; beſides many other advantages which are not allowed or permitted to this ſtate: So that, there is no fear the Soul ſhould ſleep or ceaſe from acting, when looſened from this earthly body.</p>

And as it was with him, ſo ſhall it be with us, in our order, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and proportion; Chriſt our head lives, and is ſeated at the right hand of God in the higheſt glory and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, (for he there makes interceſſion for his Church;) and becauſe he lives, we his members ſhall live alſo.

put all his enemies under his feet; are very ſilent in delineating and depaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out to us, the ſtate and condition of the Soul between Death and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. Yet this we are aſſured of in general, That the Souls of Good and Holy Men, are alwaies under the careful eye of Heaven, and live in joy and felicity, farr above the troubles and diſcontents that attend this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and evanid life they lead on Earth: and on the contrary, That ſhame and miſery await the refractory and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimable ſpirits of Impious perſons, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſeparation from their terreſtrial bodies. But, whether the one be in Heaven, properly ſo called, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of thoſe great diffuſions of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which ſhall be conferred on the children of the Reſurrection; and the other in Hell, that is, in that place of torment <hi>prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> or into which Death and the Grave ſhall be caſt, when time ſhall be no more, immediately upon their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union from their Bodies; the Sacred Writ hath no-where determined. He therefore, who will ſeek further, may indeed light upon ſome probable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, which may bear the viſage

and phiſnomy of truth, but can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver poſitively aſſert them as convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and indubitable. The only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in Speculations of this Nature, is, To decide them by free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced Reaſon and Philoſophy: and if by that light and conduct, the mind of man fall upon any concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſentient with the Attributes of God, or thoſe eternal and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble laws, implanted and wrought in the eſſential frame of the Creation; though I do not ſay, it is impoſſible for him then to erre, yet his miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage will be exceeding pardonable, pleaſant, and ingenuous. I confeſs, the world hath been long contented to live in an eaſie and affected ignorance; and men, either out of a deplorable proclivity to vice and impiety, or from a ſtupid and blockiſh zeal to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, willingly profeſs, that all things are uncertain, and ſit down in this, that we can know nothing; as if the wiſe and benign Author of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings had made the very eſſential prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our Natures, fallacious; and that we ſhould then be moſt of all deceived, when we think we have the cleareſt apprehenſions, and moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct

               </gap> to diſcriminate between truth and falſhood: And though it be true, that an honeſt and ſincere heart be dear and precious in the eyes of God, and ſufficient to inſtate a man in that happineſs which attends the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful adherents of the Kingdome of Light; yet he that employes his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in ſearching out ſuch conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable truths in Nature and Providence, as may benefit the world, and do good to the generations of men, ennobles his Soul, and widens it for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of ſome greater good and influence, from that inexhauſtible Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which gave life and being to the whole frame of Nature. But I fear my Pen has been too luxuriant in pleading for the free uſe of Natural Reaſon, and I have need of your pardon, and ſhall make amends, by falling imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the Queſtion in hand.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96883:19"/>
ſeparation from the body; but that there is ſome middle State of Being between Death and the Reſurrection. And that you may not think I take in the aſhes of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſeek to revive and blow up that ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory;</hi> I ſhall crave leave to tell you, that by this middle State I mean no ſuch condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Being, as that wherein a man from his impious tranſactions in this life, ſhall undergo very ſharp and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute torments, the protraction or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviation of which yet, depend upon the will and pleaſure of his Holineſs and mercenary Prieſts; and after ſuch a time of penance and purgation, be delivered, and tranſlated into Heaven: but, ſuch a ſtate, wherein, by a due purification of their minds, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugation of thoſe ſtubborn luſts and deſires which exalt themſelves againſt the life of God, and which were not throughly tamed in this life, the Soul of man becomes wholly dead to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inordinate affection, and daily kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles that fire of Divine Love, till at laſt it ariſe to a perfect flame, and triumphantly carry up the duly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared ſoul, like <hi>Elijah</hi> in his fiery cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Argum. 1.</note>And this is no more than what Reaſon it ſelf aſſures us of; For, he that ſhall conſider, that the operations of the Spirit of God upon mens hearts, and their progreſs in Holineſs and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, are wrought ſucceſſively by parts, and diſtant proportions; and that a man is not a Saint in an inſtant, or by the Piety and Religion of a day; but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and reaches to that glorious Crown by patient continuance in well doing, and that by ſharp and unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried conflicts with Luſt and Sin, by habitual and perſevering acts of Virtue, and an undaunted Reſolution, he muſt demonſtrate himſelf a true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſciple and ſouldier of the Son of God: muſt neceſſarily conclude, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the infinitely far greater part of men are damned, yea, thoſe who have had very ſmall, and few opportunities of doing good to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others in this life; or elſe that there is a time and place of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering themſelves, and where that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign Spirit, who expreſſed his dear compaſſion in hovering over the new born world, will be as ready to help
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96883:20"/>
forward the tender inchoations of the life of God, and perpetually raiſe and lift up thoſe fettered ſouls into the true liberty of the ſons of Heaven and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. As the efformations of the ſpirit of Nature out of fitly-prepared Matter, are not inſtantaneous, but gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually arrive to their perfection and maturity; So are the operations of that Univerſal Spirit of Love and Goodneſs upon the hearts of men, where-ever he meets with fit and kindly diſpoſitions and capacities. And ſurely no man can, without blaſphemy, think that God ever was, or will, at any time or place, be wanting to the faithful endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and attempts of ſincere perſons, after the participation of his own I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and the renovation of their minds and ſpirits into that divine frame and temper, which is dearer to God than any thing in the world. Nay, he can never do it; for it is as poſſible for the Sun to withhold his beams from ſhining upon the earth, and leave the diſconſolate world to an eternal night of ſorrow and darkneſs, as for God, the Sun of Heaven, to be divided from that which is his own life, and ſuſpend his kindly influence from the tender
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96883:21"/>
productions of his Nature. I can ſooner believe, that darkneſs ſhould deſert it's black and pitchy caverns, and ſport with light and the day; or that the Elements ſhould change their natures, and the Frame and beauteous order of things be tumbled into an eternal confuſion; as once to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a thought that God ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and ſevere to the pious breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of an innocent and harmleſs Soul. There being therefore in the world ſo many truly Religious perſons, who affectionately pant and aſpire after a greater communication of the life of God, and yet are denied thoſe oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of perfecting their minds, which others enjoy, by reaſon of that place and ſtation aſſigned them, by the wiſe, and unerring Providence of God, in this tranſitory life; there being likewiſe ſo great a part of the world lying yet under a ſquallid barbarity, wholly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and loaden with the ruines of their broken Natures, whom yet the Son of God thought not unworthy his care and love: ſurely it would be a great eye-ſore and blemiſh in Heavens righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Oeconomy and diſpenſation in the World, if there were really no time
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96883:21"/>
or means allowed for the recovery of theſe lapſed Souls: whoſe condition, though it be very ſad and calamitous, yet it is not deſperate, nor are they ſunk below the compaſſions of their Maker, but ſtill lye under a benign aſpect: and though the Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſeem to ſet in a cloud, and leave their Hemiſphere to a night of darkneſs; yet there is hopes that there will come a time (if it be not already) wherein he will riſe again with healing in his wings, and viſit the deſolate and dejected regions of the world, with his chearing heat and vigour, and their entangled pinions be again ſet looſe, and their plumes freely diſpread in the open and boundleſs tracts of Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and Joy. It is not the will and pleaſure of God that any innocent perſon ſhould periſh; and therefore we may conclude, that there is ſome time and place, where the young and tender efformations of God's holy life, in the more harmleſs Pagans, and ſuch who lived in the dark and ignorant age of the world, ſhall be brought to their due meaſure of maturity and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For, to think they are damned,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96883:22"/>
is not ſuitable to that everlaſting Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is the ſource and root of the Divine Perfections; And that they are not immediately tranſlated into Heaven, properly ſo called, will appear from the Oeconomy of Providence in the world, and the Nature of the thing it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Arg. 2.</note>As an Appendix to this, we may add, That Heaven is rather a State than a Place, and conſiſts in the frame and temperament of a mans mind and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and if we could imagine a degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and ſinful perſon taken up into Heaven, unleſs God did likewiſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly change and alter the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent temper and diſpoſition of his mind, it would be a pain and affliction to him, and he would be no more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of dwelling in that glorious bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than Owls and Night-birds to face the Sun, and ſteadily behold that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing luſtre. When the benign Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of all things produced the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fabrick of Heaven and Earth, and repleniſhed all the empty regions of the World, and the vaſt capacities of immenſe Space, with diverſe ſorts and degrees of Beings; he ſo wiſely order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96883:22"/>
and diſpoſed every thing, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould act beyond it's ſphere, but proportionately to thoſe powers and faculties it became inveſted with; for ſo the order and frame of the world required. Thus, the beaſts of the field cannot live perpetually in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor fiſh in the air, becauſe the vital congruities of the one are adapted to the groſs and more compacted body of the Earth, the other to the fluid and yielding Element of the Water. The Angels, which are an Order of Spirits above the rank of Humane Souls, cannot actuate and inform a terreſtrial body; nor can man, in his earthly ſtate, become an inhabitant of the thinner tracts and regions of pureſt <hi>Aether.</hi> When therefore in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God created Mankind, foreſeeing that they would not alwayes continue in the immortal manſions of Paradiſe, but eat and dye, and inſtruct them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by unhappy experiments, in the frail and imperfect fate of this lower World; he fitted them with ſuch vital powers and congruities, as might ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitate them for action, that ſo the revolutions of the wheel of Providence
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96883:23"/>
(though wide, and ſeemingly intricate and perplext) may at laſt appear equal and unerring. There being then a peculiar Craſis or congruity required to inform that heavenly Body, which ſhall be the reward of departed Saints at the Day of God, (and that not to be awakened but by a long and regular depuration of the Mind, and perfect ſubmiſſion and reſignation to the will of God;) we cannot rationally ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that any one ſhould paſs imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from the Body, to thoſe regions of Light and Glory, before this Divine Principle be ſufficiently invigorated, and the others perfectly laid aſleep. And to think that God will immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call forth into act this Aethereal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity of life in the ſoul of every pious Man, departed this life, is to ſet the miraculous power of God at a very cheap and eaſie rate. Beſides that, it deſpoils the Nature of the Creature, and renders uſeleſs and ineffectual ſuch Faculties as, without this ſupernatural check and controul, would, in their due time, awake, for the orderly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of that, to whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction we entitle the immediate opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96883:23"/>
of the Divinity. Nor doth it leſs entrench upon the Wiſdom of God, by drawing ſuch a Scheme of things, wherein God muſt continually unbare his arm, and upon every occaſion exert his eternal power for the effecting of that, which would certainly ariſe in it's order and proportion, by the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and operations of rational agents, accompanied with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence and aſſiſtance of divine grace and benediction. For ſo we ſee that God works in men now; and we may as well think that God ſhould take every man immediately into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon his firſt embracing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and by his infinite power make him a perfect Saint, as that he ſhould do the ſame for them upon their death-beds, or upon their diſ-union from their bodies. Farr be it from us to entitle ſuch precarious, and unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table actions to the Deity; but rather believe, that the conſtancy and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of his Nature is ſuch, that he alwayes works orderly, and according to thoſe Laws and Rules he hath placed in the World, unleſs a viſible and certain good of a part, or the whole
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96883:24"/>
Creation intervene, and cannot ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly be effected by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of Natural Agents. And now let us conſider how very few there are that have arrived to ſuch eminent degrees and meaſures of virtue, as to be capable of this exalted ſtate of mind; and what multitudes of ſincere and hearty lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of truth and righteouſneſs are ſnatcht away by the rude arms of death, before the luxuriant branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Animal or Brutiſh life are taken wholly away; and Reaſon will extort this confeſſion from us, that there muſt be a time of purgation in ſome ſtate on this ſide Heaven, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the infant productions of the Divine Nature may ariſe to their full maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and perfection. For, it cannot conſiſt with that eternall Goodneſs which is the rule and meaſure of all the actions of the Deity, to ſend the greateſt part of Mankind into the World, there to lead a frail and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and, at beſt, but a ſhort life, ſubject to infinite caſualties and imperfections, and (which yet blemiſhes Heaven's righteous Oeconomy) having but very
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96883:24"/>
few, and thoſe weak means and inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual helps, as to the recovering the broken and decayed Image of God in their Souls, for the want of which notwithſtanding they ſhall be thrown into everlaſting miſery: I ſay, it cannot conſiſt with the Benignity and Goodneſs of God, to deal thus with his Creatures: Wherefore, if we will not admit of this, we muſt ſeek out ſome other <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> to ſalve up thoſe flaws and defects which otherwiſe will appear in the beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Order and miniſtration of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
            <p>Not to omit any thing which might give light to the preſent Queſtion, I ſhall conſider the uſe of thoſe terms and expreſſions in Holy Scripture, which by many are extended and drawn to the contrary Senſe; and me-thinks from thence ſome few glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings ray forth, on purpoſe, as it were, to allure the lovers of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to a diligent ſearch and inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after it. <hi>In my Fathers houſe</hi> (ſayes the Son of God) <hi>are many manſions: but I go to prepare a place for you.</hi> The whole world is the houſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96883:25"/>
of the great King, and in it are many Outer-Courts and different Places, both higher and lower Rooms, fitted for the ſeveral capacities and ſtates of all his Servants; and yet, there was a place whither all holy Souls ſhall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, and which was not then ready. From whence 'tis plain, that the Souls of the Patriarchs, and holy men, which lived before the Coming of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> were not entred into the <hi>Coelum Beatorum,</hi> that is, into Heaven, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called; but were in a ſtate of joy and happineſs, (which the Greek Fathers call <gap reason="foreign">

And this is the Receptacle of all good men, in whom the fire of Divine Love is not ſo enflamed and kindled, as to melt their leſs pure bodies into a Celeſtial ſplendor. And to this accords that ſpeech of Chriſt to

            <p>I conſider therefore, the whole World, under God the great Monarch of the Creation, (ſo many, I mean, as participate of Reaſon and Intellect) to fall under a Political Government; and it ſeems altogether neceſſary, that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96883:28"/>
among the aereal Inhabitants it ſhould be ſo; for they being a mixed, and heterogeneous number, of good and bad, if there were not a due executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe Eternal and Sacred Laws enacted by the Counſel of Heaven, for the promoting and eſtabliſhing Piety and Virtue, and the everting and eradicating Vice and Impiety, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all good and holy men would be unſpeakably grievous and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; there being ſo many degenerate Spirits, who are only awake to the life of the Body, and being wholly dead to all ſenſe of Pity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, pleaſe themſelves in wreaking the rage of their furious and exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Luſts upon the Innocent and Virtuous: whoſe calamity muſt needs be Eternal, ſhould not that juſt <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſis,</hi> which pervades the eſſential con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>textures and inmoſt capacities of the whole Creation, erect a Polity and Kingdom of Light, to preſide over, and curb the lawleſs actions of the dark Aſſociates. And as the Condition and ſtate of ſeparate Souls is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner quite different from ours, ſo their Laws and Mulcts are diverſe, and are
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96883:28"/>
beſt known to thoſe that live under them: But whatever they are, 'tis moſt certain, their Penalties are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely executed upon offenders. And, for the due effecting of this, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the peace and quiet of this great Empire of Intellectual Agents, there are Aethereal Princes ſet over the ſeveral Kingdomes of the World; and, in ſubordination to them, are, the Governours, or tutelary Angels of Provinces, and little Exarchats; and laſt of all, every mans particular Genius, or guardian Angel: ſo that this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment reaches even from Heaven to Earth, and none can, through ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty or power, free themſelves from it. Conſidering therefore, The blew Arch, or Concave of Heaven, is ſo full of eyes, and careful Inſpectors of the ſeveral actions and demeanours of ſeparate Spirits, and their puniſhments ſo ſharp and heavy, 'tis not to be thought that they will eaſily be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to violate any of their Laws, (of which, perchance this may be one, of concealing their ſtate from us Mortals) unleſs ſome one begg a Patent or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, to ſatisfie the importunity
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96883:29"/>
of a relict Friend, or diſcharge the obligation of an Oath. And this may be one reaſon why we hear ſo little news from the aereal Regions.</p>
            <p>Another great Cauſe of their ſo ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome appearing to us, may be the d<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fficulty and uneaſineſs of incraſſating their Vehicles; Thus have I ſeen, of twenty boyes, bathing and waſhing in the ſtreams, ſcarce one delight in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the bottom; and if perchance he do, his ſtay is ſo ſmall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, that, had he been ſent on Embaſſie to the Fiſhes, the time would ſcarce permit him to have Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, before he were conſtrained to diſappear. And I am the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in this perſwaſion, from thoſe aſſiduous Apparitions of Spirits among the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> whoſe Air being groſs and clammy, 'tis no hard matter for a <hi>Daemon</hi> to condenſate it to viſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and from hence it was, that thoſe people uſed to interr their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Friends under their hearths, that ſo the warmth and heat of the fire, accelerating the putrefaction of their bodies, and rarefying the Craſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of the Air, might prohibit their
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96883:29"/>
otherwiſe more frequent Viſits. And he that ſhall recollect ſome, of thoſe many ſtories of Phantaſms, and the Apparitions of Spirits, which every age ſupplies us with; and take notice of thoſe artifices and wayes, which, in all probability, they make uſe of, when they intend to ſhew themſelves to the frail eyes of men: he cannot but conclude it to be a pain and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, to conſtipate and hold toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the groſs particles, and glutinous ſuffuſions of their Vehicles, for any conſiderable time. Hence it is, that thoſe <hi>Spectra</hi> which infeſt the Earth, are generally maleficent <hi>Daemons,</hi> whoſe ſpirital part, grown fat and dull, through a perpetual indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to their lower Faculties, like Swine, they take a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency in dabling and ſoaking their vehicles in the miry, and caligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous tracts of the Air; and often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come viſible, by fermenting and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the ſtagnant blood of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable bodies they left behind them, and which the charity of men laid to reſt in the Earth. And, by the way, this is the reaſon why ſometimes the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96883:30"/>
               <hi>Spectra</hi> have never been ſeen or heard of, after the burning and conſuming of their bodies, which furniſhed them with effectual inſtruments and proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their gameſome or wicked at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts. But if this be not ready at hand, they deſcend into the naſty Caverns of the Earth, and attract to them the thickeſt fumes and exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; or elſe ſuck in the impure and fulſome ſteams ariſing from the blood of ſlain beaſts, like the <hi>Zabii,</hi> licking the blood of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Sacrifices, which is, nor only a kind of Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their vehicles, but the moſt likely means to transform themſelves into whatſoever viſible ſhape they pleaſe. To this purpoſe is that of <hi>Porphyrie,</hi>

moſt part horrid and gaſtly, like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they appear to them. From the conſideration of theſe evil <hi>Genii,</hi> we may proportionably gueſs at the ſtate of thoſe better Souls, who have nothing more to do upon the Earth, when they are once departed from it; or, if they appear again, it is upon a great neceſſity, and for a weighty occaſion; and then they ſcorn and abhorr thoſe ignoble wayes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king themſelves objects of our Senſes; and having effected their deſign, they are no more heard of, but reſt in peace and quietneſs; chiefly aiming at the looſening and freeing themſelves from their commerce with the impurer parts of matter. For, as the other do delight in incraſſating, ſo theſe are continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intent upon attenuating their Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicles, and awakening to life their ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereal congruity; which having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, they become inviſible to the Aereal Inhabitants. And, as when we traverſe the hills, and ſuck in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer guſts of air, we are more vivid and cheerful, and 'tis an affliction to ſtay in a thicker and unwholſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; ſo theſe purer Spirits, having
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96883:31"/>
free acceſs to the tops of mountains, and more ſerene Quarters of heaven, find themſelves ſenſibly pained, when they deſcend into theſe lower tracts, and coagulate their looſer bodies into a viſible conſiſtency.</p>
            <p>To give ſome further light to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical conſideration of this Argument, in reference to the Apparitions both of Good and Bad Spirits; it may be, it will require almoſt as deep a degree of Fancy, to conſtipate their aery Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to viſibility, as it doth to attain to that <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or ſeparation and disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Soul from this terreſtrial Body without Death, and then it is no wonder if ſo few appear to us: For, though the matter of their Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicles may be very pliable, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily formed into any ſhape, yet the efformation of it into this, or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, depends not ſo much upon the will, or arbitrarious power, as upon a very ſtrong imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, impreſſed upon, and reaching the plaſtick Faculty; and it ſeems to be no more in their power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſe their Bodies into viſibility, than it is in ours, to rarifie our Blood into
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:96883:31"/>
Steam and vapour. Their bodies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, naturally falling into humane ſhape, and retaining the characteriſtical perſonality they bare in this world, if at any time they conſtrain them to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent another effigies, or contract and conſtipate the laxe and diffuſe particles of their vehicles, ſo as to become ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us, it cannot be counted a ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous action, that is effected by an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power, but depends upon the ſtrength of Imagination which, although it act more quick and perceptibly upon their tenuious bodies, yet all effects are not equally produced by the ſame degree of Fancy or Imagination: Thus the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature, or impreſſion of a Cherry upon the <hi>Foetus</hi> in the womb, is more eaſily produced, than the transformation of all it's members, into thoſe of a Cat or Dog.

               </gap>; ſo I deny not but ſome ſeparate ſpirits, may, by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and the aid of the Spirit of Nature, which may not improbably be thought aſſiſtant at ſuch Feats as theſe, without any great pain or trouble become viſible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:96883:32"/>Having given you this brief account of the Queſtion, I ſhall digreſs a little (if I may call it ſo) to another Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, not unlike the former, and that is, <hi>Why Good Angels, and pure and defecate Souls, whoſe exalted State makes them no leſs lovers of Men, than when their radiant Goodneſs was clothed with Humanity, and dwelt among them; ſhould nevertheleſs hide it, by their ſhort, and ſeldome Converſe with the World?</hi> The great Cauſe of it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeems to lye in the general wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs and impurity of mens lives, inſomuch that wickedneſs has delug'd the World; and Impiety and Vice, like a mighty torrent, ſwept away the ruinous and broken remains of Virtue, and defaced the air and features of the Divine Image, ſo that Holineſs looks like a ſtrange and unknown thing, as if it were as much forſaken of God as deſpiſed of men. For ſurely, did a real Spirit of truth and righteouſneſs prevail in the hearts of mankind, and were they inoffenſive and harmleſs, as the Sons of God and virtue, laying aſide all Envy, Pride, and Self-intereſt, and expelling the principles of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96883:32"/>
Nature, and becoming in all things conformable to the mind and temper of the Holy Jeſus; there would be no ſuch ſtrangeneſs between Heaven and Earth, but the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the Divine and Terreſtrial Nature would be more frequent; and the Holy Angels, and the departed Souls of Juſt Men, would deſcend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, and viſit the World, and Men would be made one Polity with them; and to Dye would be no more than to walk out of a cloſe Priſon, into the free and unbounded Air. For, what elſe can there be that ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede, or put a ſtop to ſuch happy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments, ſince their pretenſions and deſigns on both parts are the ſame, that is, the carrying on the Divine Life in triumph, to its utmoſt comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and perfection, and the utter ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Kingdome of Sin and Darkneſs? The Angels, though much more noble than we, yet are no nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and ſelf-contracted Beings, ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves in the circles of their own glory, in an utter oblivion, or abhorrence of the poor and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous condition of the Inhabitants of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96883:33"/>
the Earth, but full of love and benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, remembring them as thoſe who were once inveſted with the ſame hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs themſelves now enjoy; and therefore are careful Obſervators of them, and Promoters of their felicity; Nor can we imagine, that Death can alienate the affections of pious and holy men departed this life, from their fellow mortals, or make them leſs compaſſionate and ſtudious of their good and welfare, but rather increaſe, and fann their Love into Flames and gentle Ardors, and having more knowledge, and a greater reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their wants and neceſſities, become not unintereſſed Spectators, but earneſt Abettors of their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and faithful attempts, in reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering their ancient glory. 'Tis to be hoped therefore, that the time will come, before the periods of this World are run out and unra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd, that the Divine Life ſhall have a general conqueſt over the hearts and minds of men, and a Spirit of Love and Righteouſneſs overſpread the face of the Earth; and men ſhall be fully aſſured and convinced even to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96883:33"/>
outward ſenſe of the immortality of their Souls, and the joyes of a future life, by the frequent entercourſe and converſe of holy and benign Spirits with them in theſe regions of the Earth.</p>
            <p>To reſume and conclude my former argument: That the apparitions of ſeparate Souls are rare and infrequent, proceeds from the cauſes above reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but, that there have been ſome in all ages, ſerves to carry on that great deſign of Providence, in aſſuring men of the future ſubſiſtence of their Souls, and confronting that dull and ſottiſh ſpirit of Atheiſm, which is gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad into the world; That there is ſomething in us that looks beyond the periods of this fleeting life, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives our aſhes, and is capable of acting freely and nobly, when theſe carneous fabricks ſhall fall aſunder, and be cramm'd into their narrow Urns. The Soul of man, while 'tis held captive in the ſhackles and fetters of fleſh and blood, is but in a Sleep, or a longer Dream; and the expiration of this terreſtrial period, which we call Death, is the expergefaction, or awakening thoſe

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:96883:34"/>
concerning the lawfulneſs <hi>of Praying for the Dead,</hi> and, <hi>Whether the mutual obligations of friendſhip ceaſe, when they are removed from the ruinous fabricks of their Earthly Bodies?</hi> And truly, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, it is a Problem worthy your eximious and generous mind, which is not contented only to make uſe of all the inſtances and opportunities of doing good to mankind in this life, but your pious charity would likewiſe follow them into the next; and, if it might be, make them as happy as God at firſt created them. For (as I have often heard you diſcourſe) it is a pain and affliction, great as the tearing and rending our bodily life, to a noble and free ſpirit, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade himſelf, that, when our Piety hath committed our dead Friend's bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the Earth, its common Parent, and beſprinkled his Hearſe with a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral tear, and, it may be, for ſome ſmall time after, breathed out a freſh gale of Sighs upon the ſight of a Picture, or any thing, which, with his laſt words, and dying groans, he recommended to us as his Memorial; that then he ſhould be baniſhed out of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96883:35"/>
our minds, and no more regarded, than if he had never lived in the world, or were now quite extinct, and put out of Being. I cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore attribute this unconcernedneſs for the ſtate and condition of departed Souls, to any thing elſe, but to that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and narrowneſs of ſpirit, which makes men look upon themſelves as private, and particular Beings, ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world to promote and advance their ſelf deſigns and little intereſts, in contradiſtinction to all the reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, forgetting that they are a part of Gods Creation, and members of that great Body Politick which reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es from Heaven to Earth, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended every way through the vaſt comprehenſions of immenſe Space; and therefore, that all the Creatures ought to have a ſhare in their love; and that the more perfect their Natures are, the more they ought to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened and enlarged in Charity, and an univerſal Benignity towards all, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially towards mankind, in promoting, to their utmoſt power, the completion of their happineſs. For, although men, when they go away hence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96883:35"/>
inviſible to us, and we are in part at loſs, in reference to their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and concerns; yet nevertheleſs we are aſſured they are in Being, and members of that great Society, of which we our ſelves make a part; and therefore are not to be accounted ſuch ſtrangers to our thoughts and devotions: and if their Prayers can at all prevail, and be effectual in our behalf, I do not ſee why the Prayers and Oraiſons of a Good and Holy Perſon upon Earth, may not enter the eares of Heaven, and derive a bleſſing upon them, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them to ſtand in need of thoſe things he deſires in their behalf. That ſeparate Souls are not unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of us when they have left the priſons of Fleſh and Blood, and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit a new and ſtranger freedome, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily be denied; unleſs we will ſay, that the more perfect they grow, the leſs charity and love they retain towards thoſe who want thoſe degrees of felicity they have arrived unto. 'Tis true, thoſe holy Spirits which depart hence, are ſeated far above the reach of Envy or Paſſion; and the dead Wife is not troubled at the ſongs
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96883:36"/>
ſung at the next Bridal Feaſt, nor grieved to ſee another inherit the Joyes of her Husbands-bed; but yet they are not removed ſo farr, as to beget in them an utter oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe they have left behind: nor doth the augmentation of their Happineſs, diminiſh their love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us Mortals, who begin our lives with weeping, as a ſure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of our future calamities; and the fi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſt tribute we pay to the light of the Sun, is to preſent him with a tear, and watry eyes. There is then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt a Relation continued ſtill, which, not only the laws of their Friendſhip, but their own native good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which diſpreads it ſelf every way, when freed from the contagion of Earthly Concretions, will never ſuffer them to reſcind: To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Joſephus</hi> brings in <hi>Abraham</hi> thus beſpeaking his ſon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> before that fatall ſtroke deſign'd to let out that pure Soul into the Skies; <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96883:36"/>
St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> gave ſome things in charge to his dying brother <hi>Satyrus,</hi> that he ſhould do for him in the other world. And as they preſent themſelves before the Throne of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in humble Petitions for us, ſo certainly ſomething belongs to us to do for them; and we muſt, by all thoſe wayes we can, preſerve, and continue the memory of our dead Friends, and of all good men: which can no wayes be better done, than by deſiring God, with hearty and conſtant Prayer, to call home his baniſhed to him; that thoſe <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>thoſe little particles, and ſhreds of Divinity,</hi> (as <hi>Epictetus</hi> calls the Souls of men) may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered up, and re-united to the firſt, and al comprehenſive Good; and when the periods of this world ſhall be expired, they may have a joyful Reſurrection, and a perfect conſummation of their Bliſs, in the Immortal Regions of Glory and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> prayed for <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiphorus,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.18. <hi>The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day;</hi> who, 'tis probable,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:96883:37"/>
was at that time dead, becauſe the Apoſtle ſalutes the houſe of <hi>Oneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus,</hi> and not <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> himſelf; who, doubtleſs, had he been alive, and part of his family, would have been named particularly in the firſt place, and not afterwards, diſtinct from his Houſe. But I do not lay ſo much ſtreſs upon this: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the dead are in a ſtate and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of being bettered, (as I think I have ſufficiently proved they are, by what I have ſaid in anſwer to your ſecond Queſtion) they may likewiſe receive good and advantage by our Prayers. For, to think that the Soul of man is immediately ſnatched up into the higheſt bliſs and happineſs in Heaven, or depreſſed into the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell, is not only contrary to Reaſon, but repugnant to the ſenſe of Antiquity, which unanimouſly determines a time, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> before ſhe can be admitted into the ſociety of the Spirits <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:96883:37"/>
upon them in the other. For, let any man that thinks otherwiſe conſider, what he means by Heaven, and if he have any congruous, and rational apprehenſion and Idea of it, he muſt neceſſarily conclude it to be a ſtate of the higheſt purity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and the fartheſt removed from the infectious pollution of Mortality, and dreggs of the Terreſtrial Life, and then let him reflect upon the moral Natures and Diſpoſitions of the greateſt part of Mankind, when they leave this world, and ſee how many vitious habits and inclinations towards the complacencies and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate pleaſures of ſenſe remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified, how ſtubborn and inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their wills are yet to ſincere Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Righteouſneſs, and how vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous the Animal and bodily Life is, notwithſtanding the continual contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and oppoſitions of Reaſon, and higher principles; and how ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few of thoſe which are ſincerely good and righteous, to their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt powers, have brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the Divine Life, ſo as to awaken in them that high and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:96883:38"/>
principle of Life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality: let him, I ſay, conſider theſe things, and then tell me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he can rationally averr, That the Souls of men, immediately upon their ſolution from their bodies, are carried into thoſe degrees of happineſs which are competible only to Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally good and Virtuous Spirits. Nor can this enervate the force of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation, to ſay, That all the ſins which a good man is guilty of in this life, proceed from his union and conjunction with this terreſtrial Body, which continually adminiſters fuel to the flames of inordinate Paſſions and irregular Deſires and Actions; and conſequently, when he is freed from the ſtrait and narrow Laws of Mortality, he will become neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Good; and it will be as impertinent to pray for his emendation, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in Holineſs, as when we ſee the Sun leaving our Hemiſphere, to pray that he may riſe, and enlighten the world again to morrow. For, beſides the ridiculouſneſs of ſuppoſing the Soul of man, immediately upon it's relinquiſhing the Body, to ariſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:96883:38"/>
to ſuch prodigious degrees of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Wiſdom, and Goodneſs, that ſhe becomes an Angel, or Demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>god, or, I know not what tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Being, and ſo perfectly cleared, and purified from all ſpots and defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments contracted in this life; as that glorious Eye of Heaven, the Sun, cannot eſpie a blemiſh in her; beſides this, I ſay, one may well queſtion, Whether the Soul of man will be ſo Neceſſarily, and Fatally Good, in the other ſtate, as the Objection ſeems to inferr; ſince that ſhe is never out of the reach of danger, till ſhe hath attained her heavenly Body, which Chriſt, the righteous Judge, ſhall beſtow upon her at the general Reſurrection; but is alwayes encompaſſed about with the ſame inviſible enemies, which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended her in this life; (there being a mixture, and complexion of good and bad Spirits, as of Mankind upon Earth): nor can ſhe be totally freed from the extravagant impulſes, and motions of her body, though it be farr more paſſive, and yielding to thoſe gentle impreſſes and ſtrokes ſhe layes upon it, to countermand it's luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96883:39"/>
ſollicitations to Impurity and Vice: And, though we ſhould grant her to be Heroically good, (which is all that can be deſired) yet her own Will, the principle of her firſt Rebellion and Apoſtacy, ſtill remains, and ſhe can have no greater ſecurity of her non-retrogradation, and falling back again, then the Angels, or ſhe her ſelf enjoyed, before her unhappy lapſe: ſo that even here, there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a timely care and vigilancy; and, if the moſt virtuous Perſon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, may ſtand in need of Good Mens Prayers, to be excited to this careful induſtry and inſpection over his wayes, then may they likewiſe in the other world. The Similitude therefore is ill applyed, from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and inevitable laws of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and corporeal Motion, to the emergent and ſpontaneous effects of free Agents; for, unleſs we will make thoſe bright Suns of Immortality, the Souls of men, to be purely Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Contrivances, and deſpoil them of all liberty and innate principles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to guide, and determine their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; we cannot imagine, that their
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:96883:39"/>
Apogee's and Perigee's, the exceſs and diminution of their rayes, and beams of Righteouſneſs, ſhould be ſo fatal and determinate, as the Riſing and Setting of the material Sun, which illuminates the World. But, laſtly, If we are to pray for nothing, which we are certain will come to paſs whether we pray or no; I do not ſee how any man can ſay thoſe Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in that moſt excellent Prayer our Bleſſed Lord himſelf hath taught us, wherein we deſire, God's <hi>Name to be hallowed, his Kingdom to come,</hi> and <hi>his Will to be done;</hi> for all theſe things will certainly be effected and accompliſhed, although we never pray that they ſhould: Or, what need we pray, as our Church enjoyns us, in her compleat, and exact Service and Office of Burial, that God would ſhortly accompliſh the number of his Elect, and haſten his Kingdom? Will not ſuch Prayers as theſe, according to this Rule, be wholly uſeleſs and inſignificant? Did not Chriſt pray for his Apoſtles, in the dayes of his Fleſh, whom yet he knew certainly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere, and continue faithful unto
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96883:40"/>
Death? But I need not multiply In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in this caſe. He that will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low therefore the duct of Reaſon, which alone ought to be Judge in this caſe, where the Scriptures are ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, muſt neceſſarily ſubſcribe to this, That thoſe who go out of this Body with love and affection to Sin and Vice, muſt receive a puniſhment proportionable to the inequality and obliquity of their ſpirits; and be fatally carried to ſuch places of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, as are ſutable to the courſneſs of their tempers; and, ſo on the contrary, That Virtuous minds ſhall be rewarded with ſuch degrees of Felicity, and take up their ſtation in rhoſe Habitations which are moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous and agreeable to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Genius<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s; and, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that thoſe, who have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered their Luſts, nor ſubdued their rebellious Habits, but are taken away in the conteſt between the law of Sin, and the law of the Mind, that is, when the man is neither wholly alive to God nor Sin, but in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate ſtate, carrying a warr with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, and acting perpetually with a
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96883:40"/>
reluctancy, and adhering ſometimes to the one, and then to the other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, according as the ſtrength of Natural corruption, or the auxiliaries of Reaſon prevail upon him; he muſt conclude, I ſay, that ſuch Perſons as theſe, dying, cannot be immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with the Bliſs and Glories of Heaven, becauſe they have not as yet performed the condition upon which that Felicity is entail'd; which is, to be changed and renewed in the ſpirit of their minds, to be purified through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and become holy as God is Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, partaking of his Nature, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming in all things conformable to the Holy Jeſus, as to a perfect and compleat Copy of all Virtue and Righteouſneſs; Nor will the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Almighty God, whoſe Spirit is alwayes taking hold of every heart, that retains any capacities and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the reception of it's own Nature, fruſtrate ſuch auſpicious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, but rather cheriſh and fold them, like a tender mother, in it's loving arms, till it bring them to that due perfection, which alone can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them the proper ſubjects of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96883:41"/>
and Life. It will follow then, that ſuch as theſe (and ſuch are the greateſt part of mankind) are fit and adequate objects of our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; Nor can the ſmall, and only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural knowledg which we have of the ſtate of ſeparate Souls, make us ever a whit the more remiſs in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming theſe exerciſes (which are the only ones we can ſhew) of love and charity to our departed friends, if we remind our ſelves of what I before hinted, and ſhall now further proſecute; <hi>viz.</hi> That the unfallen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and the Spirits of good and holy men, departed this life, and all juſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon Earth, who are daily breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after, and aſpiring to the higheſt pitch of a Chriſtian life, are one Polity, Society, or Corporation, which reacheth from that Bleſſed and Glorious Seat of Majeſty, which we more eminently call Heaven, to this Globe of earth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we live; ſo that, all thoſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundane Spaces are repleniſhed with ſeveral ranks and orders of inviſible Agents, who are, as the benign-eyes of God, beholding the adminiſtration of the affairs of the Earth, and protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96883:41"/>
the ſincere lovers of truth from the tyranny and invaſion of the Airy Principality; and there is no need we ſhould fancy them beyond the Stars, when they have quitted their bodies; where all that they can do (if haply they can attain ſo much), is, to be compaſſionate Spectators of our Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, being unable to afford the leaſt relief or ſuccour, but look upon them as not farr diſtant from us, where they may not only behold the ſeveral tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of men, but really aſſiſt and abette their innocent and pious attempts after the divine life and Nature. And the more good and purified they are from the contagion of mortal concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the more compaſſionate and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign Inſpectors will they be of humane affairs and more concerned in their behalf for their advantage and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p>
