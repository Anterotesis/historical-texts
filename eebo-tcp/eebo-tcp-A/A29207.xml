            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>hath not</hi> David <hi>rather sent his servants to search the City, and to spye it out?</hi> They spake not altogether without reason, Ambassadours are often honourable spies; but in this case their suspicion was groundlesse. You see we are not the first Nation, whom needlesse Jealousies have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, or imaginary Feares have plunged into reall dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Evill Counsellors who infuse malignant notions into the eares of Princes, are like those who poyson a common Fountaine, whereof all the City doth drinke. On the other side, Blessed is that Kingdome, where the Kings friends are <hi>Alexanders</hi> friends, where the favourers of the Common-wealth, are the favourites of the Prince; Such may be truly called, the <hi>Worse-men and Chariots of Israel,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 13.14.

Evill counsell in the end proves worst for them that give it. By seeking to prevent <hi>David,</hi> they invite him to their owne ruine. Thus the will of God is fulfilled, even whil'st it is shunned. Yet these evill Counsellors were not <hi>in nubibus,</hi> in the clouds, the fact was evident. If it were sufficient to accuse, who should be innocent?

First, against the light of nature, to punish upon a bare suggestion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proofe or discussion, whereas in criminall causes the proofes ought to be clearer then the noone-day light. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, against the Law of Nations, To use Ambassadours in that barbarous manner, whose office is sacred, and ought alwaies to protect their Person: yet we see how Gods Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours have often met with the same entertainment. Thirdly, against the rule of policy, First to disgrace and provoke men of parts and power, and then to dismisse them: which errour cost the <hi>Samnites</hi> deare, when they had the <hi>Roman Consuls</hi> and <hi>Legions</hi> in their mercy, cooped up at <hi>Caudium</hi>: They did neither dismisse them honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, to oblige the <hi>Romans,</hi> as they were first advised, nor cut them off every mothers sonne, to disable the <hi>Romans</hi> to revenge, as they were advised in the second place, but caused them, after they had disarmed them, to passe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefully under the yoke, and so dismissed them with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30743:4"/>
which they revenged soone after with the ruine of the <hi>Samnites.</hi> Fourthly, against piety. By the Law, torne garments were proper to Lepers, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13, 45, They were forbidden to <hi>round</hi> their <hi>heads or to marre the corners of their beards, Lev.</hi> 19.27. But the <hi>Ammonites</hi> thought to put a jeere upon the Jewish Religion, even as some of late have ludibriously abused those holy Garments, and Bookes, and Vessells, which we use in the service of God. The <hi>Ammonites</hi> found that it was not good to jeast with edge-tooles: Profane <hi>Lucian</hi> was torn in pieces with dogs, and the other will find, that God is a severe avenger of such impious scoffes.</p>

If the <hi>Syrians</hi> be too strong for me, thou shalt help me, And if the <hi>Ammonites</hi> be too strong for thee, I will help thee. As when one foot trippes, the other is ready presently to sustaine it. And here in my Text, By encouraging one another to play the men, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to play the man, As it is said of the Children of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> that they went out as one man, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.7. That is, with one heart, and one soule, animated with the same desire of the publicke good. The left hand doth not stand more in need of the right, then an Army doth of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of its Commanders; where I see this blessed sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, I cannot but eccho out that of the Psalmist, <hi>Behold, how good and joyfull a thing it is, brethren to dwell together

But where men are drawne into action as a beare to the stake, by force or feare; where a little base Plunder is preferred before Honour, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; where there is Faction, Envy, and Emulation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst great Officers, it portends Destruction, and Dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation; The God of heaven and earth ever blesse this Army from it. And if there be any person within the sound of my voyce, who are conscious to themselves of such sinister respects, or of any other impediment, which may retard our hopes of an happy Victory, either by offending God, or disabling them to doe the duties of their places, I doe here beseech them by that service which they owe to God, by that allegiance which they owe to His Majesty, by that love which they owe to their native Countrey, to sacrifice them this day to the common Cause, or at least with the Serpent to deposite them so long, till this Army returne againe in peace.</p>

This is certaine, No City in the Universe can have a more glorious title then this in my Text, to be one of <hi>the cities of our God.</hi> But why are the cities of <hi>Israel</hi> called <hi>the cities of God?</hi> For two reasons, First, because the Lord had a peculiar inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in this land above all other lands, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.23. <hi>The land shall not be sold for ever, for the land is mine, ye are stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and sojourners with me</hi>; So the Lord was the true owner, the <hi>Israelites</hi> were but the usufructuaries. Secondly, because they were the Church of God, <hi>Juda was his Sanctuary, Israel his Dominion,</hi> in them he had <hi>put his name. Solomon</hi> knew the true mother from the feigned, by her love to the childe, So a genuine sonne of the Church may be distinguished from a counterfeit, by his affection to the Church. <hi>By the rivers of Babylon we sate downe and wept, when we remembred thee O Sion.</hi> And <hi>Arise, O Lord, and have mercy upon Sion, for why, thy servants thinke upon her stones, and it pittieth them to see her in the dust</hi>? But the Church requires not onely our affections and supplications, but our best endeavours, It is recorded of <hi>Theodosius</hi> that good Emperour to his eternall honour, that upon his death bed, he was more solicitous <hi>for the cities of God,</hi> that is, the Churches, then for himselfe, or

his posterity. And when ordinary endeavours will not serve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the sword is never more justly drawne then to defend Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: As we reade of those builders of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> who labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with their trowells in the one hand, and their swords in the other hand, <hi>Neh.</hi> 4.17.

A private man may lawfully keep the possession of his house or land against all acts of violence, much more may a whole Church hold the possession of their Religion. Three sorts of losses principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerne a man, First, in his estate, that is but chaffe; next in his body, that is but branne; lastly in his soule, that's the flower, and there is the greatest losse: <hi>What shall it profit a man to winne the whole world, and lose his soul?</hi> We do not reade of any Wars among the Heathen for Religion, except to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Sacriledge. The reason was partly in their Gods, which were sociable to admit fellowes. When <hi>Tiberius</hi> made a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Senate to have Christ admitted into the number of their Gods, it was answered, that he was <hi>impatiens consortis,</hi> not like their Gods, he would admit no companions: And partly in themselves, many of them were of opinion, that as variety of instruments makes the sweetest consort, so variety of Religions makes the best harmony in the eares of God. But now see how the world is turned, Sacriledge is grown a principall part of Gods service, (or else some have but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle share of Religion, who yet despise all others as profane.) Now <hi>uva vel faba,</hi> a Grape or a Beane is too too much for Gods service, though <hi>David</hi> was of a more generous dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,

If he see it be good for us to be Conquerers, we shall be Conquerers, If not, we shall die gloriously; however <hi>Blessed be the name of the Lord.</hi> Men never prosper who deale too magistrally, and will needs be their owne carvers with God.

But leaving them to their superstitions, It is an happy conflict which is undertaken for a good cause, where they neither fear sinne from the slaughter of their enemies, nor danger from their own deaths, where they kill securely, and are killed more securely, being defended with armour without, and with a good conscience within.

               <hi>Syrians</hi> are first beaten, and presently thereupon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the hearts of the <hi>Ammonites</hi> faile them: they never looke into the field againe. <hi>Rabba</hi> the royall city of <hi>Ammon</hi> is taken by King <hi>David,</hi> and upon this occasion <hi>Syria</hi> is absolutely subjected to the Crowne of Israel. Let the successe prove answerably to all that hate his Majesty, and let the application be to his Enemies. But <hi>let those that love him be as the Sunne when he goeth forth in his might.</hi> So and never but so shall this <hi>Land have rest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Exhortation will be somewhat longer. It was wisely said, <hi>Externus hostis unitatis vinculum,</hi> A forreigne enemy is or ought to be a composer of Domesticke differences. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth teach us to unite our selves for our owne preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Cast water into a dusty place, and it will contract it selfe into round globes to save it selfe, An Embleme of asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation; yet this is contrary to it's owne disposition. Humid bodies are easily conteined in other bounds, difficulty in their owne. <hi>Vomitio vomitionem sedat, &amp;c.</hi> If a veine be broken within the body, the ready way (say the Physitians) to stay the bleeding, is to open another without. If a Forreigne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my doe not cure our rancorous dispositions one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I can say no more, but <hi>Quos perdere vult Jupiter hos pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os dementat,</hi> whom God will have destoyed he first infatuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Simple and prepossest people, may be seduced by Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Protestations, to beleeve that their comming is really for the good of this Kingdome, I deny not but it may so accidentally fall out, But I desire to know when did ever any Nation that intended War, want such pretences? <hi>Am I now come up without the Lord against this land? The Lord hath said unto me, goe up against this Land,</hi> said <hi>Senacherib, Isay</hi> 36.10. Can the vast charge and the bitter fruits of the last voyage be so soone forgotten of us? When the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> once made a reasonable suite to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> even in their owne judgement, yet they rejected it, in this respect,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30743:10"/>
least they should teach their neighbours of <hi>Lacedem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> the way in like cases to <hi>Athens,</hi> or give them an haunt to make such suits. What I pray you would they have done, if the suite had been unjust and unlawfull, if their neighbours had made such a motion in a chargeable, commanding, hostile manner?</p>
            <p>I have seen their latest and shortest Declaration, sent from <hi>Barwicke</hi> by the Commissioners, in a Letter to <hi>Sir Thomas Glemham,</hi> to satisfie their brethren of <hi>England</hi> in these three things, concerning their present Expedition. First, of <hi>the justnesse of their Cause.</hi> Secondly, of <hi>the lawfulnesse of their calling thereto.</hi> Thirdly, of <hi>the faithfulnesse of their carriages therein.</hi> If they faile in any one of these, their Expedition is unjust, and cannot be approved in the judgement of a <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> for <hi>bonum ex singulis circumstantiis, malum ex quolibet defectu.</hi> But if they faile in every one of these (as they doe,) what good shall we expect from such a voyage. <hi>Doe men ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grapes of thornes or figs of thistles? Mat</hi> 7.16. First for the <hi>justnesse of their cause.</hi> Hearing them so often tell of their <hi>cleare demonstrations,</hi> who would not have expected some downe right authorities, and presidents from the Word of God, or at least some authenticke proofes from the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Lawes of one or both Kingdomes? These are the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard and measure of <hi>Justice</hi> to us. Who would not have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that they should at least have endeavoured to have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the late <hi>Acts of Pacification,</hi> so solemnely passed in both Kingdomes? But for all these behold a deep silence. If silence be not a plenary consent, yet in this case it implies strongly, that they know in their owne consciences, that the Lawes of God and man are both against them. But in stead of these, they professe <hi>before God and the world, that their hearts are cleare from all sinister intentions,</hi> that <hi>the love of Christ requireth Christians to heare one anothers burthens,</hi> that <hi>he Law of nature doth challenge their care and endeavour to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30743:10"/>
prevent their owne danger, which is wrapped up in their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi> Alas, what poore bulrushes are these to beare the weight of so much Christian bloud as is like to be shed in this Cause? That Plea taken from <hi>their owne danger</hi> shewes us plainly, that howsoever they pretend the <hi>love of Christ,</hi> yet their charity begins at home. Indeed there is no fence for feare, but what cause have we given them to feare? <hi>Nihil ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendum video, sed timeo tamen.</hi> Unlesse it be that of the wise man, <hi>Wisd.</hi> 17.11. <hi>Wickednesse condemned by her owne witnesse is very timerous, and being pressed with conscience, alwayes fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casteth grievous things.</hi> But let us take their words for once, seeing we can have no other assurance of their <hi>intentions.</hi> It is not a good <hi>intention,</hi> nor a pretended <hi>love of Christ,</hi> nor a supposed <hi>necessity,</hi> nor any one of these, nor all of these to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that can justifie an unlawfull action, <hi>It is not lawful to doe evill that good may come of it.</hi> Charity and Justice goe alwayes hand in hand together, this is for feare of an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine danger, to run into a certaine sinne. But they tell us that they come <hi>to rescue the Kings Person out of the hands of evill Councellors, who are enemies to Religion.</hi> In serious cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses it is dishonourable to trifle with pretences: Doe they thinke, or can they thinke, that the King is kept in durance against his will? or necessitated to do any Act contrary to the dictate of his owne reason? I appeale to their owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. It were greatly to be wished, that they would once speake out and name the <hi>evill Counsellors.</hi> The History of this Kingdome doth shew that Treason hath often put it selfe into this Dresse, seeking to hide it's deformity from the world, under this painted maske of removing <hi>evill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors</hi>; God be blessed His Majesty hath now the flower of both Houses of Parliament about him, (I hope these are not the <hi>evill Councellors,</hi>) and daily more and more are repairing to him, so many for number, so venerable for their condition, that all your Committees put together, doe not deserve to be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30743:11"/>
named upon the same day. If we look backe to former Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, we shall find the most of these, <hi>Great Confessours,</hi> and in will <hi>Martyrs</hi> for this Common-wealth. Some of them clapt up into the Tower, others into the Fleete, others dis-justiced in the Countrey, and disabled to leave all offices, for their love to their Countrey, and shall we now be frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from them with the name of <hi>evill Councellors</hi>? But yes perhaps they are <hi>enemies to Religion</hi>; It may be so, to that Religion which innovations would introduce by force of Armes, but not to that Religion which is established by the Lawes of this Kingdome, and which God hath so long blessed to us and our fathers with peace and happinesse.</p>
            <p>In the next place they goe about with the same successe, to <hi>justifie the lawfulnesse of their calling.</hi> An hard taske, seeing <hi>England</hi> is quite without the Spheere of their activity. Here I expected that they should have cited some fundamentall league of both Nations to this purpose, or something that might have satisfied conscience. But all they say in defence of their calling, (except the iterated Pleas of their own ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, and mischievous Counsells, which they insert here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,) may be reduced to this briefe summe, That this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is desired by our <hi>Parliament,</hi> and concluded by the consent of their <hi>Committee</hi>: We will for the present suppose that which we know to be otherwise, and they once never able to prove, that the two Houses were full, and free, both from force, and feare. Yet there are three maine imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in their calling, First, nothing can give what it hath not, but it is cleare by our Lawes that the two Houses never had, nor have any power of Armes, but his Majesty alone. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the Parliament had power to call, yet they being Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, have no power to entertaine such a motion without the consent of their Soveraigne, notwithstanding all their vowes and Covenants; which never bind a Subject contrary to his Allegiance, nor a child contrary to his filiall duty. Thirdly,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30743:11"/>
it is as cleare that the <hi>Parliament</hi> can give no such <hi>conclusive</hi> power to a <hi>Committee.</hi> They themselves are but Proctors for our Shires, Cities, and Burroughs, and by the Law, <hi>a Deputy cannot make a Deputy.</hi> Then let all men judge what a calling this is like to be, where the Cause is without all efficacy, the Object without capacity, and the Meanes without idoneity.</p>
            <p>Their last labour is to cleare <hi>the faithfulnesse of their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages herein,</hi> And that is by <hi>their promises.</hi> A weake tenure, any man may be rich in promises. The Pipe playes sweetly whilest the Fowler is about his prey. But they goe farther, to give <hi>the Publicke Faith of the Kingdome of Scotland.</hi> It seemes they thinke that <hi>English</hi> men are to be catched with chaffe. What is the <hi>Publicke Faith of a Kingdome</hi> worth without the concurrence of the King? especially being given by a Committee. There was a time when such a thing called <hi>the Publicke Faith,</hi> would have passed currently, though not with a Scrivener, yet with some credulous Citizens, but now they will as soone trust a Knight of the post. They know not how to implead the <hi>Publicke Faith,</hi> or to arrest the <hi>Publicke Faith,</hi> or to imprison the <hi>Publicke Faith.</hi> The Declarers appeale to their former voyage, <hi>How little dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage was occasioned by their meanes, how little disorder was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by them.</hi> But to passe by many things that might be justly alledged, in respect there is <hi>an Act of Oblivion,</hi> Then they were well paid, with a large <hi>overplus,</hi> (I hope it was not for a <hi>Come-againe,</hi>) now they can expect no paiment in mony, and in such a case how is it possible that the souldiers should be kept from disorder? Lastly, they ingage themselves that this Expedition <hi>shall be made no use of to any other ends, then are expressed in the Covenant, and in the Treaty subscribed by the English Commissioners.</hi> What not accidentally by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular persons? What <hi>Committee</hi> can undertake that? Wee have not seen any <hi>Covenant</hi> of theirs to invade <hi>England,</hi> If they have made any such, it binds them neither more nor
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30743:12"/>
lesse, then <hi>Herods</hi> oath did bind him to cut off <hi>John Baptists</hi> head, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.7. Or that desperate vow, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.12. did bind the Jewes to murther <hi>Paal.</hi> But we have seen a Copy of the <hi>Treaty,</hi> If it be true, it is the highest burthen that ever was imposed upon a Kingdome. The <hi>English Commissioners</hi> know how to cut large swatches of other mens Cloth. But who shall tie the bell about the Cats necke? It gives them <hi>all the Lands and Estates of all Popish Prelaticall persons, and of all Malignants who have assisted or contributed to the King</hi> (That is of all men) <hi>betweene</hi> Trent <hi>and</hi> Tweede, <hi>untill all the Arrerages for</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>and the charge of the War be satisfied,</hi> With Caution, <hi>that the Army shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part till then out of</hi> England, that is untill the Day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But all the craft is in catching; this is like one of the Popes Donations, it wants the consent of the right owners. Men will fight hard before they be stripped of their lively-hoods. Who ever heard that a conquering sword was capable of any distinction betweene persons? <hi>Luculenta fortuna,</hi> a good estate will be found more dangerous then a different o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion either in Religion or Pollicy. All the favours their English friends can expect, is <hi>Poliphemus</hi> courtesie to <hi>Vlysses,</hi> to be last eaten up.</p>
            <p>The case being thus, Give me leave for one Word to your <hi>Excellence. Be of good courage, and let us play the men, for our people, and for the cities of our God.</hi> Repell the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and the <hi>Ammonites</hi> will soone turne their backes. We may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture safely now, where the strength of this <hi>Sampson,</hi> this great Rebellion hath laid all this while, If the Lord returne you againe with Victory, you shall bring back both a Lawrell Garland to decke your owne Temples, and an Olive-branch of Peace in your hand, for our happinesse.</p>
            <p>I have another Word to the Auditory, <hi>Be of good courage, and let us play the men, for our people, and for the cities of our God.</hi> In this case, I wish to every true English-man, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:30743:12"/>
and affection of that Souldier, who having his legs cut off in fight for his Country, yet desired to be cast into the breach, that he might dull the edge of one sword more. It is better to die, then survive the honour of our Nation, and to suffer these things which are worse then death, Schisme, Slavery, Beggary, and whatsoever an insulting Enemy can inflict upon a degenerous people. <hi>Dulce &amp; decorum est pro patria mori,</hi> It is a sweet and comely thing for a man to die for his Country, and for his Religion. <hi>Quam gloriosi revertuntur victores de praelio, quam beati me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuntur martyres in praelio?</hi> How gloriously they returne Conquerers from the battell? Or how blessedly they die Martyrs in the battell? If they overcome, they are crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a Lawrell Garland, If they die, with a crown of Martyrdome, saith Saint <hi>Bernard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If wee compare our present condition, though heavy through Assessements, and some disorder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of a necessitous unpaid Army, with what it was within the circumvoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the last Yeer, or little more, when we were blocked up almost on every side, and this City now a patterne of loyalty to the whole Kingdome, was even ready to have been made a nest of Rebellion, we shall find that we have cause to blesse God and the Instruments of our safety. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the burthens of the Country have been great, but how collected, how distributed, how ordered, all men are not satisfied. This is evident, that those who have <hi>born the greatest heat and burthen of the day,</hi> those that have <hi>jeopar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their lives unto death in the high places of the Field</hi> for our protection, have had the least share. I say no more, nor would have this construed to the disrepute of any well deserving Patriot.</p>
