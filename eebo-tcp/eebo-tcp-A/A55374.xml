            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THE variety and differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Religion, between
Protestant and Papist, distract
the minds and trouble the hearts of
all that have any sense of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Concernments. In this distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
every serious man that hath
any care of his Souls health, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
choose but heartily desire and
seek for resolution: To obtain
this, there can be no better way
than to understand and examine
the Pretensions and Grounds of
both Religions: In order to this,
I have endeavoured faithfully to
<pb facs="tcp:109465:3"/>
represent, and duly to weigh
them in the following Discourse.</p>
            <p>Wherein though I have not
discussed all the Points in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
between us and them,
yet I have selected the most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial,
and have discoursed of
most, if not all, their weighty
and plausible Arguments against
the Protestant Religion. And
this, I may say, and no knowing
Papist, I think, will deny it; all
the other Points will follow the
fate of those which are here exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
and live or die with them.
I know it will be pretended, that I
have managed the Work with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
and deceit, and that I make
the Papist speak what I please, not
what they think. This must be
<pb facs="tcp:109465:3"/>
said of course, else the <hi>Romanists,</hi>
lose their old wont: Nor shall
I, at all think it strange, if in stead
of solid Answers, they return Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies:
their cause requires it;
and no wonder if they that want
Truth in their Religion, make
lies their Refuge.</p>
            <p>To silence all clamours, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
all jealousies will be impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
I shall never attempt it.</p>
            <p>But for satisfaction of such as
are rational and ingenuous, I shall
give this following account.</p>
            <p>1. God is my witness, that I
did diligently endeavour to pick out
the strongest Arguments I could find
in their best Authors in each
Point; nor have I willingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
any thing of moment in the
<pb facs="tcp:109465:4"/>
Questions here debated: If any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist
think otherwise, let him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
their greater strength, and
I hope he shall find it fairly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
            <p>2. The several Discourses, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
and Answers which I put
into the Papists mouth; are such
as were first taken out of their
mouths, and so it is but a piece
of Iustice and Restitution to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
them thither. They are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
such as are either known
to be their opinions, and by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
owned, or else delivered in
the sense, and very oft in the words,
of their most approved Authors,
whom I have quoted in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent:
But here I expect the old
clamour of false Quotations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="tcp:109465:4"/>
they have been so often taken
tardy, that they must now look for
the common infelicity of—not to
be believed if they should chance to
stumble upon Truth. All the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
I desire in that case is, that
the Reader who is able to do it,
would examine them with his own
eyes, and that will be my best ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.
I shall detain thee no
longer, but commend thee to the
good Spirit of Truth to enable
thee to discern between good and
evil.</p>

            <head>TO THE
PEOPLE
OF THE
Romish Church.</head>
            <p>THE Controversies between your
Church and ours, are by Gods
blessing upon the endeavours of
his Ministers, brought to this pass, that I
am perswaded there is nothing wanting to the
Conviction of divers of you, but a free and
diligent perusal of theri Books, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
and partiality: This your Priests
knowing, it is their great design to keep
you from looking into them; and to that
end, to possess you with this Principle,
<hi>That you need not trouble your selves
to inquire into Books, you are safe
enough, so long you believe as the
<pb facs="tcp:109465:6"/>
Church believes, and follow the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of your Priests and Fathers:</hi> if
this be an Errour, it is a dangerous one,
and may prove Damnable; That it is so,
and that it will prove but a broken reed,
when you lean upon it, I hope you will see
there is reason to believe, if you will but do
your souls that justice, not prodigally to
cast them away upon blind and wilful
mistakes, and take the pains to read these
ensuing lines.</p>
            <p>1. If your Church be not infallible, then
this Principle is rotten; howsoever, you
cannot with safety or discretion venture
your souls on it, till you have examined at
least this one point of the Churches Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility:
do but examine that, and if you do
not stifle both Reason and Conscience, you will
see it is a meer cheat.</p>
            <p>2. If the Church (<hi>that is,</hi> a Pope with
a Council) were infallible (which is all
that your great Champions plead for) yet
all confess, that your particular Priests
(upon whose conduct you hazard your eternal
wel-fare) are fallible and subject to mistakes.
It is most certain that divers of your Priests
<pb facs="tcp:109465:6"/>
and Confessors lead you into many (and some
<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f them damnable) Errours. Thousands of <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>our
 Priests and learned Doctors do charge
the Iesuits with poysoning the souls of the
people with divers pestilent and damnable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
such as these: <hi>That a man may
venture his soul upon any probable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and that is probable, which but one
of their learned Doctors affirm. That a
private man may kill his enemy to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his honour, though not by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.
That a Priest may absolve even old
and inveterate sinners, and such as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
incorrigible. That affliction or
sorrow for sin, arising meerly from fear
of punishments, is sufficient for salvation:
and, that the affection of loving God is
not absolutely necessary to salvation.</hi>
All these and many more are clearly
proved out of their own words and writings
in the Provincial letters, otherwise called,
the Mystery of Iesuitisme: See the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Edition set forth and defended by <hi>Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drockius.</hi>
Now if the Iesuits may, and do,
so damnably deceive those thousands of you
that depend upon their counsel and conduct,
why may not other Orders deceive you in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things? Or what is there that can give
you any reasonable security? Is it their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb facs="tcp:109465:7"/>
prudence, pretended devotion, or honesty, or
any other such like quality? Why, divers of
the Iesuits have given as plausible testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of those things (so far as men can judge)
as most of the other Orders; or will you say,
all other Orders are infallible, the Iesuits on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
excepted?</p>
            <p>3. Nothing can be more evident (if the
Bible be the word of God) than that the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
or misguidance of the Priest, will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
the sin of the people. To satisfie you in
this, I beseech you consider these few reasons.</p>
            <p>1. The Scripture condemns, and God
severely punished those people, which did
follow the errours of their Priests. This did
not excuse the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Aarons</hi> time, that
they were misled by <hi>Aaron, Exod.</hi> 32.
nor those in the times of the wicked Kings of
<hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> that their Priests did uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
deceive them, and poor <hi>Elijah,</hi> and so
<hi>Michaiah,</hi> were left alone; nor those in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachy's</hi>
daies, that <hi>the Priests caused them
to stumble at the Law, Malac,</hi> 2. 8. nor
the Crucifiers of Christ, that they obeyed the
decrees of their Priests and Rulers.</p>
            <p>I list not to repeat what I have said else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where:
therefore read Nullity of Romish Faith
<hi>ch. 2. sect.</hi> 12. And will you yet stumble at the
same stone!</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:109465:7"/>
2. The people will not be excused by their
Priests misguidance, because they neglect
their duty. If indeed there were no duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
upon the people but to believe what your
Priests say, and do what they require, then
your Church speaks reason. But that none
but a mad man will say.</p>
            <p>There are several duties required of the
People, no less than of the Priests; the Law
of God was not given only to the Priests, but
to all the People; God publisheth this law in
the hearing of all the people, and speaks in
the singular number to every one of the people,
<hi>thou shalt do or forbear</hi> this or that; and
the curse is threatned to the people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.
26. <hi>Cursed be he that confirmeth not
all the words of this law to do them, and
all the people shall say</hi> Amen. Which
the Apostle repeats, <hi>Gal. 3. 10. Cursed
is every one,</hi> not Priests only, but the People
too, <hi>that continueth not in all things
which are written in this book of the law
to do them.</hi> If the Priests <hi>then</hi> should have
taught the Israelites (as your Priests now
teach you) <hi>thou shalt worship a graven i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi>
when God saith, <hi>thou shalt not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
a graven image:</hi> can any serious man
think this would have freed them from
<pb facs="tcp:109465:8"/>
that curse; and that it was safer for them
to obey the Command of men than of God?
O the impudence of your Priests that dare
say so! O the blockishness of those people that
will believe them when they say so! your
<hi>Pope</hi> may well contend with <hi>us,</hi> for it seems
your <hi>Priests</hi> will contest with <hi>God</hi> for <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy:</hi>
When the Priests and Prophets in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saiahs</hi>
daies were generally corrupt, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are not advised to believe all that they
taught, and to obey all that they decreed (which
is the strain of your Church) but are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
immediately to go <hi>to the law and
to the testimony,</hi> and <hi>if any speak not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to them,</hi> they are to be rejected,
<hi>because there is no light in them,</hi> Isa. 8.
20. Even people are required <hi>not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
every spirit,</hi> but <hi>to try the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
1 John</hi> 4. 1. Nor did the Apostles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
themselves and their doctrines from this
<hi>Tryal,</hi> but allowed, commended, and required
it in the people.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Beraeans</hi> are not reproved and censured
(as they would certainly be, that should tread
in their steps at <hi>Rome</hi>) but commended for
examining the Doctrine of S. <hi>Paul</hi> by the
Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 11. And the same A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
allows the <hi>Galatians,</hi> not only to try
his Doctrines, whether they were agreeable
<pb facs="tcp:109465:8"/>
to what they had received; but in case
they find them contrary, he gives them Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to censure and anathemize him,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8, 9. And he bespeaks the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
in this language, <hi>I speak to wise
men, judge you what I say, 1 Cor. 10.
15.</hi> And he commands the <hi>Thessalonians</hi>
to <hi>prove all things</hi> (without exception)
as well as to <hi>hold fast that which is
good, 1 Thess.</hi> 5. 21. Consider these things,
I beseech you, and do not wilfully cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
your precious souls upon trifles. God
hath given the Scripture as a rule to try
things by (and this was written for the
Ignorant, and the people, as well as the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and the Priests, <hi>John</hi> 20. 31.) he hath
given people reason to try things with, if
you will hide these Talents in a Napkin,
at your peril be it. The Prince was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to <hi>read and meditate in the Book
of the Law, that he might observe to
do all that is written therein,</hi> Iosh. 1.
8. Can you seriously think that if the
corrupt Priests had agreed to teach him to
do contrary to all that was written therein,
that this would have excused him before
God? then that Precept was both super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
and dangerous; and if you do not
think so, (as you must needs if you have
<pb facs="tcp:109465:9"/>
any Conscience) then neither will it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
your people; for according to the
Doctrine of your Church, Prince and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are alike in this, both tied to believe as
your Church believes. God commands eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Christian to <hi>prove his own work;</hi> and
tells us, that <hi>every man shall bear his
own</hi> burden, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 4, 5. and, that <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man shall give an account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to God,</hi> Rom. 14. 12. (Do not think
your Priests account shall serve turn) and
all the Christian people of <hi>Corinth</hi> are
commanded to <hi>examine themselves whether
they be in the faith, 2 Cor.</hi> 13. 5. And
dare you still live in the wilful breach of all
these Commands, and blindly give up your
Souls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Consciences by an implicite faith,
to the conduct of your Priests to lead them
whether they please?</p>
            <p>3. The Scripture hath given you full
warning of your danger. Read but two
places, <hi>Ezek,</hi> 33. 8. (where God assures us,
that the <hi>wicked shall die in his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
though he perished through the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
fault) and <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 14. (where
Christ confutes this very opinion of yours,
which was also the opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
that they were safe enough while they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owed
<pb facs="tcp:109465:9"/>
their Priests Decrees and Counsels:
and tells them. <hi>If the blind lead the
blind, both shall fall into the Ditch</hi>) and
doubt of this, if you can or dare.</p>
            <p>In a word, if this senceless Doctrine
were true, not only Men would have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over our Faith, contrary to express
Scripture; (<hi>Be not ye called Masters,
for one is your Master, even Christ,</hi>
Matth. 23. 10. <hi>Not that we have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over your faith,</hi> said the great
Apostle) but also Christ should lose his
dominion, and have no authority in his
Church, but as your Priests please; and
it seems he shall not have this favour from
you, to continue in his Office <hi>quamdiu bene
se gesserit,</hi> but <hi>quamdiu vobis placuerit;</hi>
and Christs power is apparently limited to
your Interpretation; but the power of your
Church is absolute and unlimited, and the
People obliged to believe them, <hi>quamcun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
sententiam tulerint,</hi> whatsoever they
shall decree, as <hi>Gretser</hi> expresseth it. If
this be not to make the word and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of God and Christ void, through your
Traditions, I know not what is. I will
trouble you no further. If you be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Counsel, take warning, and suffer
not your selves to be lead hoodwinckt to
<pb facs="tcp:109465:10"/>
Hell, to serve a Carnal Interest of some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you; but quit your selves like men,
and by the grossness of this delusion, learn
to suspect the rest; and with humble and
honest hearts, read what is here proposed to
you for your Souls good, and God give you
light. Let my Soul prosper no otherwise
than I heartily wish the good and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of you all; but if you will still persist
in your blindness, and add further obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
to your Errours, I shall comfort my
self in this, that I have delivered my own
soul, your blood be upon your own head, for
there it will assuredly fall, and not upon
the Priests only.</p>

               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>DEar Friend I am glad to
meet with you after so long a
separation; for I remember
we were brought up at the same School, and I
rejoyce in the opportunity of renewing our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
I desire a little discourse with
you, to understand how it is with you in point
of Religion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>I am of the Protestant reformed
Religion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>I am heartily sorry for it in regard
of our old intimacy; but if you will give me
leave, I do not question, but in a very little
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109465:12"/>
time to give you such reasons as will force you
to leave those damnable Errors, and to return
to your antient Mother the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>With a very good will shall I
yield my self to your Instruction, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
nothing more than true Information;
I know I have a Soul to save, which is of
infinite worth, and I am not fond of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
therefore if you give me better
grounds than I have, you shall not finde
me obstinate: but this I must tell you,
you must not put me off with fancies and
bare affirmations; but I shall expect so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
proof of what you say from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
or Reason, and now speak what you
please.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>First, my dear Friend, I must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
you to consider that which your own
Ministers teach you, to wit, That there
is no Salvation to be had out of the true
Catholick Church, which is the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>That none is saved out of the true
Catholick Church, I grant, (for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church includes all Believers in
the world) but a man may be saved that is
no Member of the <hi>Roman,</hi> nor of any
particular Church; for although you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gross
to your selves the name of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, nothing is more clear,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109465:12"/>
than that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is at best
but a part of the Catholick Church, and
that a very unsound one too; and there
is a false Church (in which salvation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ordinarily be had) as well as a true
Church (out of which it cannot ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be had) and I have heard more to
prove yours to be this false Church, than
I am able to answer, or you either, as I
suppose: therefore this being only a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
(and so an unconcluding) Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I desire you to come closer to the
point.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>Then I intreat you to consider the
danger of your way, and the safety of ours;
since all your Ministers confess, That a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholick may be saved in his Religion;
but all our Church unanimously declare,
That you are damned if you live and dye in
your Religion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>You call us Schismaticks; but
by this Argument you prove your selves
to be so: For I have oft heard it, that in the
very same manner those infamous Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
the <hi>Donatists,</hi> argued against
St. <hi>Austin</hi> and the Catholick Church, that
he confessed Salvation was to be had in
their Churches, which they affirmed was
not to be had in the Catholick Church;
and this very thing was by St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109465:13"/>
the Church of that age, condemned as
their great Schismatical Principle. But
let that pass. To come to your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Remember the condition I made
with you, that you do not put me off with
Fancies and bare Affirmations, for I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
you shall make good every word
you say. Now here I find you under a
great Mistake, and though I have heard
it most confidently delivered by divers
of your Brethren, yet you must give me
leave to believe my own eyes and ears:
I read it in divers Books of our Learned
English Divines, and I have heard it from
divers very able Scholars and Ministers,
That Popery in these times and places of
light, is to those that may see that light
and will not, not only dangerous, but
damnable; nor do I pin my Faith upon
their sleeves, but they have given me
not meer Affirmations as you do, but such
Arguments as I confess I cannot answer:
yet if you can, I shall be ready to hearken
to you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>It is easie to say in general, that our
Religion is dangerous or damnable, but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you shew me wherein; which are those
Doctrines and Practices of ours wherein the
danger lies?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:109465:13"/>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>I will instance in few of many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>First, That Idolatry is a damnable sin,
your own Authors grant, and Scripture
expresly affirms, <hi>Idolaters shall not inherit
the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10. and
Rev. 21. 8. &amp; 22. 15. And that your
Church is guilty of Idolatry, especially in
the Worship of Images, and of the Host, or
Consecrated Bread in the Sacrament, is
the Doctrine of all Protestant Churches,
and I shall prove it before you and I have
done.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the Worshippers of the
<hi>Babylonish</hi> Beast, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. and 14. are in a
damnable condition, you all grant, and it
is affirmed by God himself, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 8, 9,
10, 11. And that <hi>Rome</hi> is that <hi>Babylon,</hi> the
most and Learnedest of your Doctors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
only some of them pretend it is <hi>Rome
Heathen</hi> as it was; and others, that it is
<hi>Rome Iewish,</hi> as it shall be in the end of
the world; both which conceits are
fully refuted by divers of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that it is highly dangerous to
trust in Man, and to trust in our own
Righteousness, sufficiently appears from
<hi>Ier. 17. 5. Cursed is he that trusteth in
Man;</hi> and from that dreadful example of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109465:14"/>
the <hi>Iews,</hi> who <hi>going about to establish their
own righteousness, did not submit to</hi> (and
therefore lost the benefit of) <hi>the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Faith,</hi> Rom. 10. 3. and that you
are guilty of this sin, in trusting to Saints
and to your own Merits, shall appear in the
following Discourse.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is dangerous to add to the
Word of God; and this your Church is
not only deeply guilty of, in adding their
Traditions (<note n="*" place="bottom">Concil. Trident.</note> 
               <hi>to be received with equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
to the holy Scriptures</hi>) but obligeth
all its Members to justifie those additions,
and thereby intitle them to the same
plagues with themselves.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, (to name no more) it is highly
dangerous to <hi>break any of Gods commands,
and to teach men so, and to make the word of
God of none effect by humane Traditions,</hi> we
know what woes Christ pronounceth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Pharisees for these things. And
this your Church is deeply guilty of, as in
many other particulars, so most eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in this, that you profess no men are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to receive the Scriptures as the word
of God, nor to believe any thing in it, but
for the testimony of your Church<note n="†" place="bottom">See my <hi>Nullity of Romish Faith,</hi> Chap. 2. Sect. 4.</note>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:109465:14"/>
By this it apears, that you have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to boast of the safeness of your way.
And as for your threats of Damnation to
all that do not submit themselves to your
Church and Pope, however they may
terrifie silly people; yet toke it from me,
to prudent men it is rather an argument
of the falseness of your Religion. For
such will be apt to conclude, that your
Faith is not right, because your unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness
is so notorious, and monstrous,
in condemning all the world besides your
selves, and that too upon such frivolous
pretences. This argument therefore of
yours hath little weight.</p>
            <p>Let me hear what further you have to
say against our Religion.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>Then consider seriously of this, that
your Church confesses, that she is Fallible, and
that you have no Infallible Iudge among you,
whereby Controversies may be ended; but our
Church is Infallible.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>I confess now you speak home;
make this good, That it is necessary the
Church should be Infallible, and that
yours is so, and I shall ease you of the
trouble of further Arguments: But I
must ask you two Questions: 1. What
is the meaning of this Proposition? and,
2. How you will prove it? For the first,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109465:15"/>
I ask you how you understand it? What
is this Church which you tell me is Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible?
Are you agreed among your selves
in that point? To tell me of an Infallible
Judge, and not to give me infallible assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
who this Judge is, is to deceive me
with vain words, and will no more end
Controversies than to tell me there is an
Infallible Judge in Heaven: For where
I pray you shall I finde your Infallible
Judge? Now I am in quest of him, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
your counsel and direction. Tell me
then, Is it the body of your Church, and
multitude of Catholicks that is your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falible
Judge? Do you make your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
the Judge of Controversies?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>No, For we all agreed the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church is Monarchical.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Are you then agreed that the
Pope alone is the Infallible Judge? speak
the truth, and the whole truth, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the truth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>I will deal truly with you, we are not
all agreed in that point, the <hi>French</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
generally deny it, and divers of our emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Doctors and Writers, as (<hi>Bellarmin</hi>
confesses<note n="*" place="bottom">De Pontifice, l. 4. c. 2.</note>) and among the rest a Pope, <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
by name, denies it, and even they that seem
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109465:15"/>
to be better minded towards the Pope, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that <hi>it is no heresie to deny this, and
that divers good Catholicks deny it, and
that it is but a disputable point</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Cressy in Exomolog.</hi> In the Appendix, Chap. 4. num. 7. <hi>Holden de Resolutione fidei, l. 2. c.</hi> 1.</note>.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Is it then a General Council that
is infallible? Are you agreed in that?
deal truly and clearly with me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>Then I must confess we are not all
agreed in that neither: For the Pope will deny
this, and all the Iesuites and <hi>Italian</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
and others, who ascribe this Infallibility
to the Pope only.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Who then is this Infallible
Judge?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>The Pope and a General Council a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
together.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Is there then at this time any Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> or elsewhere, which
doth agree with the Pope?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>No, but though there be no Council
now in their persons, yet there is in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and the Pope agreeing with them is
infallible.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>But I have been told that all your
Doctors agree in this, that no Writing
can be a judge of Controversies: If you
deny this, I should think the writing of
God (which you all acknowledge the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109465:16"/>
Scripture to be) might challenge this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
as well as the writings of any
Council or men. You all plead for the
absolute necessity of a living Infallible
Judge.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>Though Catholicks are divided in
the manner of expression, yet all are agreed
in this general Proposition, That our Church is
Infallible.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Call you this only a difference in
manner of expression, for one to say the
Pope is Infallible, another to say he is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible?
for some of you to affirm the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
of Councils, others utterly to
deny it? I beseech you remember, I am
inquiring after Particulars (and therefore
do not put me off with deceitful Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals)
who, and where is the man or men,
to whom I must go to be infallibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
in all Controversies? For if the
King should tell his people he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a Judge to end all their civil
Controversies, this would be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
unless he should tell who that Judge
is, So that till I hear you are agreed in
this particular, my doubts and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
must needs remain. And then for the
next point: I ask you, how you prove this
Infallibility which you pretend to, I must
tell you since it is the very foundation of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109465:16"/>
your Faith, I expect very clear and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
Proofs, I pray you bring me two
or three of your strongest Arguments.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>In this you speak reason, and I shall
comply with your desires, I shall give you two
or three plain and evident Scriptures to prove
it. 1. That of <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18. Hence I thus
argue, The Church is said to be built upon
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> he is the Rock spoken of; and this
Rock doth together with S. <hi>Peter</hi> include his
Successours, and the Church built upon this
Rock, (that is united to, and built upon the
Pope) is infallible, for it is said, <hi>The Gates
of Hell shall not prevail against it.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Not one of all these things is
true.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>1. It is more probable that not <hi>Peter</hi>'s
Person, but his Doctrine or his Confession
concerning Christ, (which now he made)
is the Rock upon which the Church is
built; Scripture is its own best Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
It is not <hi>Peter,</hi> but Christ which is
the foundation of the Church, as he is
called, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 16. compared with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 6, 7, 8. It is expresly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11.
<hi>Other foundation can no man lay but that
that is laid, which is Iesus Christ;</hi> and this
is the more considerable, because, he
speaks against those that made the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
foundations, one saying, <hi>I am of Paul,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109465:17"/>
another, I of Apollos, I of Cephas.</hi> And if
this were spoken of <hi>Peter,</hi> no more is said
of him here, than is said of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apostles, <hi>Ephes. 2. 20. Ye are
built upon the foundation of the Apostles and
Prophets</hi>—And besides, if by this Text
<hi>Peter</hi> had been made supreme and Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Head of the Church, and Judge of
all Controversies, no Man in his wits can
believe that St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have treated
him so irreverently (to speak the least) as
he doth <hi>Galat.</hi> 2. (which is more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
because then Christ was dead,
and <hi>Peter</hi> in the actual exercise of his
Headship and Government, and if we
may believe you, publickly and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
owned for such) that he would have
equalled himself with him as he doth,
<hi>Verse 7. The Gospel of the Vncircumcision
was committed to me, as the Gospel of the
Circumcision to Peter:</hi> And that he would
have spoken promiscuously of <hi>Iames, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi>
and <hi>Iohn,</hi> that they <hi>all seemed to be pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi>
Ver. 9. and not a word of <hi>Peters</hi> being
the rock and foundation; and that he
would have <hi>withstood</hi> St. <hi>Peter to his face,</hi>
as he did, <hi>Verse</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>2. If this were meant of <hi>Peter;</hi> yet this
is nothing to his Successours. You must
first prove that St. <hi>Peter</hi> had a Successour
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109465:17"/>
in that supposed universal Headship,
which will be very hard to perswade
any understanding Man, for, 1. That au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
which the Apostles had over all
Churches, was peculiar to them, and died
with them: we see God did not think it
necessary to leave a successour to <hi>Moses,</hi>
(in his full and absolute Authority) no
more was it necessary to leave any after
<hi>Peter</hi> and the Apostles: and the reason
is the same, because the work of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
was finish'd, and those that came
after were tyed to the execution of their
Laws. 2. Besides, if <hi>Peter</hi> did leave a
Successour, what prudent man can believe,
that he would not have left some notice,
thereof to the world in one of his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles?
I find he saith, <hi>I will endeavour
that you may be able after my decease, to
have these things in remembrance,</hi> 2 Pet.
1. 15. How easie had it been to have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<hi>to that end I leave a Successour, whom
you must hear in all things?</hi> I find <hi>Moses</hi>
was very careful to leave a Successour,
and so was <hi>Elias,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and Christ
(<hi>as my Father sent me, so send I you</hi>):
Was <hi>Peter</hi> the only careless person, that
would not be at the expence of a word
to prevent all those Heresies, Schisms,
and Contentions which were even then
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109465:18"/>
broached, and most likely to increase af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the death of the Apostles in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
world?</p>
            <p>3. If any did succeed St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his
Head-ship, one would think it should
have been one of the surviving Apostles,
especially St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> who lived above 20
years after him; for who can believe
(that regards what he believes) that
<hi>Linus</hi> or <hi>Clemens</hi> who is said to be
St. <hi>Peters</hi> successour, should be superiour
to St. <hi>Iohn;</hi> yet the foundation of all
your Religion is built upon this non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensical
opinion: And if this priviledge
did belong not only to <hi>Peter,</hi> but some
of his successours; yet to say, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to all following Popes (divers of
which are acknowledged to be Apostati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
and most wicked wretches) and that
such Monsters as were the true slaves of
the Devil, and brands of Hell, should
be the foundations of the Church, by
whom the Church was to be secured
from the gates of Hell, will not find be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
with serious Men till East and West
meet together: and besides, when our
Divines say, The Pope is Antichrist, and
the Man of sin; you use to answer, that
these expressions, <hi>the Antichrist,</hi> and <hi>the
Man of sin,</hi> must needs point at a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109465:18"/>
Man, and not a whole Order of Men;
which if it be true, the expression there
used of <hi>this Rock</hi> (especially being so par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
levell'd at <hi>Peter,</hi> as you will
needs have it) cannot with any colour be
thought to mean a succession of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of persons. And sure I am, whatever
the Text speaks of <hi>Peter,</hi> it speaks not one
word of <hi>Peters</hi> Successours, and therefore
it is as easie for me to deny it, as you to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it.</p>
            <p>3. Whatever this promise or privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is, it belongs no more to the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than to the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> the name of one is heer as clear
as the other; It is a general promise ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to the Church at all times and
places, signifying, that God will have and
maintain a Church to the end of the
World: And if this place concerns only
those that are built upon St. <hi>Peter,</hi> you
grant the Church of <hi>England</hi> once was,
as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now is, built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him too, when it was subject to the
Pope. And if their being built upon
St. <hi>Peter</hi> did not secure them from Falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Apostacy (as you say it did
not) then consequently the building of
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon St. <hi>Peter</hi> did
not make them infallible, but they might
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:109465:19"/>
(as we say and prove they did) fall away.
And certainly one of these two things
must be granted, either that every Church
which did once adhere to <hi>Peter,</hi> or the
Pope, are secured by this Text from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
away; or else, that notwithstanding
this Promise, every Church that now is
subject to the Pope may fall away from
him, and so the Pope may be a head with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Body, a Shepherd without so much
as one sheep: For if this Text did prove
what they desire, that all that do adhere
to the Pope, whilst they do so, are Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
yet it doth not prove, that they all
shall constantly adhere to him (which is
quite another thing.)</p>
            <p>4. If this Promise and Priviledge did
belong to any particular Church, and to
yours (in a special manner) yet it doth
not prove your Infallibility: This place
concerns Doctrines no more than Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and secures your Church no more
against damnable Heresies, than against
damnable Practices, since the gates of
Hell prevail by one as well as by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and since you acknowledge that
<hi>Peters</hi> successours have lived and died in
damnable sins, they might as well die in
damnable Heresies: Besides, if this Text
did prove the Popes Supremacy, yet here
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109465:19"/>
is not one word concerning his Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
which is quite another thing.</p>
            <p>5. If this Text did prove any Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
it doth not prove the Popes Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
(which you alledge this Text for) but
the Infallibility of the Church which is
built upon it.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>But that Church is Infallible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they adhere to the Rock, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pope
who therefore must needs be more Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Then it seems the foundation of
all your Infallibility is in the Pope, as
<hi>Peters</hi> Successour, whom multitudes of
your own Learned and approved Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
acknowledge to be Fallible. I have
heard you all confess, That your Popes
may erre in Manners and Practice. Is it
so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>Yes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Then whatsoever he thinks, he
may speak lyes, and deceive the World,
in telling them he is Infallible; and
surely if a Man will deceive for any thing,
he will do it for such an Empire as
the Pope holds: but I have heard
also your Popes may erre in matters of
Fact.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>That we do all agree in.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Then he may mistake and erre
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109465:20"/>
in these Questions, whether <hi>Peter</hi> left
a Successour? and, whether the Bishop
of <hi>Rome</hi> be the person? and, whether
there hath been that uninterrupted suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
in the Papal Chair, which you
pretend to be necessary, which must be
Infallibly certain, or else the Pope holds
his Authority only upon courtesie; so this
place will not stand you in much stead.
Let me hear if you have any better Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>There is another place, which if you
were not an obstinate sort of <hi>Men,</hi> would
satisfie you all, and that is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15.
where the Church is called, <hi>The pillar
and ground of truth,</hi> and therefore is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Let me first ask you, What
Church is there spoken of, which you
say is Infallible? Is it the Church of
<hi>Rome?</hi> Was <hi>Timothy</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> or
no?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>No, he was Bishop of <hi>Ephesus:</hi> But
why do you ask that Question?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>This place apparently speaks of
that Church, in, and over which <hi>Timothy</hi>
was set: so if it speak of any particular
Church, it must be that of <hi>Ephesus</hi> (which
you confess was Fallible) not that of
<hi>Rome;</hi> or if it speak of the Universal
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:109465:20"/>
Church, that might be Infallible, though
the Pope and all the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
(truly so called) should fail and perish.
Tell me, I beseech you, in particular,
What is that Church, which from this
and other places, you conclude to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>It is the Pope with the General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
as I have told you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Then I pray you make sense of
the verse; for to me it is meer non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense—<hi>Timothy</hi>
is here advised to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
himself rightly in the house of God,
which is the Church of God, and the Pillar
and Ground of Truth:</hi> According to your
opinion, this is the sense of it, <hi>That thou
mightest know how to behave thy self in the
Pope and a General Council.</hi> I pray you
tell me truly, Was there a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
then sitting.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>No: there was no General Council
from that time, till two or three hundred
years after, when the Councill of <hi>Nice</hi> was
assembled.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Then it seems to me a most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
thing to say, that <hi>Paul</hi> directs
<hi>Timothy</hi> how to behave himself in a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council (which was not then in
being, nor like to be) and that he doth
not direct him how to behave himself
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:109465:21"/>
in that body, the Church in which he then
resided and ruled.</p>
               <p>Besides, I pray you, where is the Pope
or a Council called the House of God?
If they have any thing to do there, they
are the Governours, the Stewards, the
Officers of the House, but are never cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the House of God, but this name is
alwayes ascribed to the multitude of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
and Professors, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 5,
6. where <hi>Moses</hi> (whose place in the
Church the Pope pretends to) is not the
House, but the <hi>Servant, the Officer of it;</hi>
so <hi>Heb. 10. 21. Having an High-Priest
over the house of God;</hi> so 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 5. Ye
as lively stones are built up as a spiritual
house:</hi> And if you know any one place
where it is otherwise used, I pray speak;
if not (as by your silence I see you do
not) all understanding men will conclude
that neither Pope nor Council are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in this priviledge. But besides, let
me further ask you, Can you give me as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
that these words which <hi>is the
ground and pillar of Truth,</hi> imply Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>It is true, the words are figurative
and metaphorical, but that is the meaning of
them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:109465:21"/>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>My old Friend, can you advise
me to venture my salvation upon a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor?
or that that is the true and only
sense of the words? Prove it, and I am
your Prisoner; but it seemeth to me far
otherwise: God saith to <hi>Ieremy, I have
made thee an Iron Pillar,</hi> Jer. 1. 18. Was
<hi>Ieremy</hi> therefore Infallible? Peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that was too mean a metal to amount
to Infallibility; but your Church is a
brazen Pillar, and so it seems by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
of your assertions. I read in
<hi>Eusebius,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. 5. Cap. 1.</note> That the Saints of <hi>Vienna</hi> and
<hi>Lyons,</hi> called <hi>Attalus</hi> the Martyr, <hi>a
pillar and ground of the Truth,</hi> yet you
will not allow him to be Infallible; by
which and divers other passages it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
evident, that a Pillar in the
Church is no more than a man that is well
rooted and grounded and strong in the
faith, as he is a reed that is tossed to and
fro with every winde of doctrine; let me
therefore hear if you have any better ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then</hi> John 16. 3. <hi>is an express pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi>
When the Spirit of truth is come,
he will guide you into all truth, <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Chuch is infallible.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:109465:22"/>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Tell me I pray you, Is not this
promise made to the Apostles only? If so,
What is that to you? If you say other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
How do you make it appear that it
concerns their Successours?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>That appears by comparing another
place with it, <hi>John 14. 16. The Comforter
shall abide with you for ever,</hi> not surely in
their persons; for, they were to die in a little
time, but in their Successours.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>I expected a place which had said
at the least, that the Spirit Should lead
them into all truth for ever; but this is
quite another thing; you dare not say,
that every one with whom the Comforter
abides is infallible; but to forgive you
this great mistake: Tell me truly, Is it
then your opinion, That all the Successors
of each of the Apostles, <hi>viz.</hi> all Bishops,
or all Ministers are infallible?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>No, in no wise, for it is only S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
Successours, or the Pope, who is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and others only so far as they depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him and cleave to him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Then this Text is not for your
turn; for if it do extend to the Apostles
Successors, it extends either to all or none;
for sure I am, this Text makes no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
Besides, how do you prove that
these words of the Spirits leading into all
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:109465:22"/>
truth, if they do reach further than the
Apostles, do imply Infallibility. Then all
Believers are infallible, for they are all
led by the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 14.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>True, but here they are said to be
led into all truth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>You know the words <hi>all</hi> and <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
are often taken in a limited sense, as
when the Gospel is to be preached to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
creature, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. And you may
as well conclude the omnisciency of all
Believers, from 1 <hi>Iohn 2. 20. You know
all things;</hi> and <hi>v. 27. The anointing teacheth
you all things,</hi> as the Infallibility of your
Popes or Councils from that phrase: and
one Answer serves for both places, <hi>viz.</hi>
that they speak of all necessary truths.
But why do I hear nothing of <hi>Luke 22.
31. Simon, Simon, Satan hath desired to
winnow you, but I have prayed that thy faith
fail not.</hi> I have heard that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> useth

and fall into the damnable error of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
Christ to be the Messias, or was
it only an error or miscarriage of his
tongue, which spoke against his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Judgment?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>Far be it from me, to say that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
did so damnably erre in his judgment, I
know no Catholick who saith so; all do all agree
that it was only an error of his tongue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
and practical denial of Christ.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Very well: Hence then I gather,
that Christ prayed for his practical, not
for his doctrinal Faith, and that his grace
of faith might not be utterly lost by his
fall: so that, if this Text and Prayer reach
to your Popes, it should rather secure
them from damnable Apostacies in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
(which you confess many of them
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:109465:23"/>
fell into and died in) then from Heresies
(of which this Text speaks not at all.)
But have you no other Arguments?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, there is one more, which were
sufficient if there were no other, and that is
from Gods Providence; It is unbecoming the
wisdom of God to leave his Church without
a guide, or infallible Iudge, by which means
there would be no end of Controversies: and
since you do not pretend to have any such in
your Church, it must be in ours, or else there
is none in the world.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>I had thought you would have
only taught me, but now it seems you will
teach God how to govern the World. It
should seem to me, that God was not of
your mind; he did not think fit to end all
Controversies, but to permit that <hi>there
should be Heresies,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 19. And if
God in his wisdom thought an Infallible
Judge necessary, certainly that same
Wisdom would have named the place,
person, or persons, where people should
have found this Infallibility. Was it
ever known, since the beginning of the
world, that any Prince constituted Judges
in his Kingdom, not so much as giving
notice to his people who they were, to
whom they must resort for Justice? this
God hath not done; for you do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:109465:24"/>
a particular place which settles this
infallible Judge at <hi>Rome,</hi> but only some
general and fallacious Arguments, as I
have proved; and besides, it is so far
from being evident, that your selves are
not agreed about it: but some seek for
this infallible judgement in the Pope, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in a General Council; and these
do as fiercely dispute one against another
in this point, as you do against us in many
others; and therefore it is much more
rational for me to conclude thus; God
hath not nominated and appointed such
an infallible Judge in the Church; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is none, and it is not fit there
should be one, than sawcily to undertake
to be the Counsellor of the Almighty, and
to tell him what is fit to be done, and
then conclude that it is done. In short,
For Controversies about Fundamental
and necessary things, God hath provided
sufficient meanes for the ending of them,
having clearly enough determined them
in his Word for the satisfaction of all that
are diligent and humble, and teachable:
And for Controversies of lesser moment
there is no necessity of having them end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
nor would they be much prejudicial
to the peace of the world and the Church
if men would learn to give any allowance
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:109465:24"/>
for the infirmities of humane nature, and
exercise that great and necessary duty of
Charity and mutual forbearance. But
since this is all you can say upon this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
I pray you, let me hear what other
Arguments you have against our Church
and Doctrine.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>Then another Argument against
your Church and way, is taken from the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty
of it; As for our Religion, it hath had
possession in the world ever since the Apostles
days; but you are of Yesterday, and know
nothing; your Religion is an upstart Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
never heard of in the world till <hi>Luthers</hi>
days.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>First, let me ask you this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
If you had lived in the days of
Christ, or of the Apostles, or of the
Primitive Fathers, what would you have
Answered for your self? you know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than I, that this was the very Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> urged
against the <hi>Christians</hi> then; they charged
Christ with not <hi>walking after the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Elders,</hi> Matth. 7. 5. And the
<hi>Athenians</hi> said to <hi>Paul, May we know what
this new Doctrine is?</hi> Act. 17. 19. And
the <hi>Pharisees</hi> had Antiquity on their side,
being <hi>zealous for the Traditions of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
Gal. 1. 14. And though it be true,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:109465:25"/>
that the Apostles had the first Antiquity
for them, delivering nothing but what for
substance <hi>was in Moses and the Prophets,</hi>
Act. 26. 22. (which also is our case) yet
the <hi>immediate and latter antiquity</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, and for divers ages together
these Doctrines had been in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
obscured and unknown. What then
would you have Answered to a <hi>Iew</hi> or a
<hi>Heathen,</hi> objecting this Novelty to you?
Learn from Christ, who when the <hi>Iews</hi>
pleaded for the continuance of their old
practice in the matter of Divorces; he
accounted it sufficient confutation, that
<hi>from the beginning it was not so,</hi> Mat. 19. 7.
And to all the pretences of the <hi>Pharisees</hi>
from antiquity, he opposeth this one
thing, <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> John 5. 39.
So you dispute against us with the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which the <hi>Pharisees</hi> used against
Christ, and we answer you as He answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them: Besides let me ask you this
Question, If I could clearly prove to you
all the points of our Faith, and disprove
the points of yours, from the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
tell me, Would you then acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the truth of the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
notwithstanding all this pretended
Novelty?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:109465:25"/>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>Yes certainly, for we all confess the
truth of all that is contained in the holy
Scriptures.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Hence then it follows undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
that the main thing that you and I
must look to in our faith is, that it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to the holy Scriptures; and if
ours be so, (as I am fully perswaded it is)
and yours the contrary, neither antiquity
is any argument for you, nor Novelty
against us. Besides, when you charge our
Church with Novelty, I suppose you mean
that our Doctrines are new.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>I do so.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Then you cannot justly charge us
with Novelty; for,</p>
               <p>1. You confess the Antiquity and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of most of our Fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
and your selves do approve them,
only you make additions of your own to
them; you own all the Scriptures in our
Bible, only you add the <hi>Apocrypha:</hi> you
acknowledge Scripture the rule of Faith,
only you add Tradition: we believe all
the Articles of the Apostles Creed (the
<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Potter</hi> and <hi>Chillingworth.</hi>
                  </note> belief whereof the Antient Fathers
thought sufficient to Salvation). And the
Doctrine of the four first General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:109465:26"/>
as you do also: You own our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Christs satisfaction and Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Christ and Faith, only you add
your own works and satisfaction: Our
two Sacraments you approve, only you
add five more: Our Doctrine of the two
states of Men in heaven and Hell you own,
only you add Purgatory: You own
Christ for your Mediatour and Prayers to
God through him, only you add other
Mediatours; Our worship of God you
own, only you add Images. These are
the principal points of our Religion, and
dare you now say that our Doctrines are
new?</p>
               <p>2. Many of your ablest Doctors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that divers of the peculiar Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of your Church are new and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to the Antient Fathers; and it
is most evident and undeniable concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Indulgences, Purgatory, Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in one kind, Worship in a strange
tongue, the receiving some of your Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal
books, Transubstantiation (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
as an Article of Faith) the
Popes Infallibility, Worship of Images,
denying of the reading of Scriptures to
the people and others. And will you yet
brag of the Antiquity of your Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:109465:26"/>
3. These Doctrines wherein we differ
from you have been not only proved
from Scripture, but from the plain testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Antient Fathers, as I think none
can doubt that, (laying aside prejudices,)
shall read what our <hi>Iewel,</hi> and <hi>Morton,</hi>
and <hi>Field,</hi> and others have written; How
then can you have the confidence to
charge us with Novelty?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>Your Church is new in this respect,
that although some others before you might
own some of your Doctrines, there was no
Church that owned all your Doctrines, both
positive and negative.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>That is not necessary. I hope
every alteration of Doctrines of less mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
doth not make the Church new;
if it doth, it is most certain, that your
Church is new also; for nothing can
be more plain, than that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, nay even your own Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> did not antiently, in former
ages hold all these Doctrines which now
she owns (as your own greatest Authors
confess) this is sufficient, that the
Church of God, in most former ages,
hath owned all our Substantial Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.
But what have you further to
say?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:109465:27"/>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>It is sufficient against you, that your
Church is Schismatical, and you are all guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Schism in departing from the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, which is but one, and that is
the <hi>Roman.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>I desire to know of you, Whether
in no case a man may separate from the
Church whereof he was a member with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Schism?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>Yes certainly, if there be sufficient
cause for it, for the Apostles did separate
from the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> after Christs
death, and the Orthodox separated from the
<hi>Arrian</hi> Churches, and all Communion with
them, yet none ever charged them with
Schism.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Since you mention that instance,
I pray you tell me, Why they separated
from the <hi>Arrians?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>Because they held this Heresie, That
Christ was a Creature, and not the true
God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Very well: hence then I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That if your Church do hold any
Heresie, and require all her members to
own it too, it is no Schism for us to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>That must needs be granted, but
this is but a slander of yours, for our Church
holds no such Heresies.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:109465:27"/>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Your Church doth not hold one,
but many dangerous Errours and Heresies,
as I do not doubt to manifest e're you and
I part: And if you please, we will leave
the present Argumeut to this issue, if I
do not prove your Church guilty of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
and the imposition of it too, I am
content you should charge us with
Schism; if I do, you shall mention it no
more.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>You speak reason, let it rest
there.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Besides, methinks, you deal bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barously
with us, you drive us out from
you by your tyranny, and then you blame
us for departing; as if <hi>Sarah</hi> had call'd
<hi>Hagar</hi> a Schismatick for going out of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s
family, from which she forced
her: Tell me, I pray you, if the case be
so that I must depart from the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church, or from God, What must I do?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>The case is plain, you must rather
depart from that Church.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>This is the case, If I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from your Church, she will force
me to live in many mortal sins. I must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
a hundred lies, I must worship the
Cross and Relicks, and Images, which
God commands me under pain of his
highest displeasure not to worship. I
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:109465:28"/>
must worship the Sacrament with divine
worship, which I am assured is no other
for substance than bread; for your
Church is not content to hold these opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
but she enjoyns these practices
to all her members. And if things be thus,
I think you will not have the confidence,
any more to charge us with Schism for
obeying the command of God to come
out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> since you force all your
members to partake with you in your
sins, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 4. Besides all this, let me
ask you upon what account you charge us
with Schism.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>For departing from the Catholick
Church, and from your Mother Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and from the Pope, whose Subjects
once you were.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>If then I can prove that we are
not departed from the Catholick Church
nor from our Mother Church, nor from
any of that subjection we owe to the
Pope, I hope you will acquit us from
Schism.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>That I cannot deny,</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Then this danger is over: For
1. We never did depart from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, which is (not <hi>your particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>
Roman <hi>Church,</hi> as you most ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:109465:28"/>
call it, but) <hi>the whole multitude of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
and Christians in the world:</hi> Nay, the
truth is, you are the Schismaticks in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
all Communion with all the
Christian Churches in the world, except
your own, (which are equal to yours in
number; and many of them far superiour
in true piety.) Next, we do not own
you for our Mother: <hi>Ierusalem</hi> which is
above, (not <hi>Babylon</hi> that is beneath) is the
Mother of us all. If we grant now you
are a true Church, yet you are but a sister
Church.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>You forget that you received the
Gospel from our hands.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Suppose we did really so; Doth
that give you authority over us? If it did,
not <hi>Rome,</hi> but <hi>Ierusalem</hi> should be the
Mother Church, from whom you also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Gospel: This you deny, which
shews that you do not believe your own
Argument to be good. And for the Popes
Universal and Infallible Authority which
he pretends over all Christians, I have
diligently read your Arguments for it;
and I freely profess to you, I find your
pretences both from Scripture and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
so weak and frivolous, that I durst
commend it to any understanding and
disinterested person as a most likely means
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:109465:29"/>
to convince him of the vanity and false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of that Doctrine; that he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
any of your best Authors, and the
very sight of the weakness and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
of your Arguments would abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
satisfie him of the badness of your
cause.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>You have no Ministers, because you
have no uninterrupted succession from the
Apostles, as we have, and therefore you have
on Church, and therefore no Salvation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>I observe you take the same
course that the Adversaries of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
ever did, who when they could not
reprove the Doctrine of Christ and his
Apostles, they quarrelled with them for
want of a Calling, as you may see, <hi>Iohn. 1.
25. Mat. 21. 23. Act.</hi> 4. 7. But the good
Christians <hi>of that time</hi> took another
course, and examined not so much the
Call of the persons, as the truth of the
Doctrine, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 17. It seems to me a
secret confession of your guilt, and the
Error of your Doctrine, that you are so
careful to turn off mens eyes from that to
a far meaner point. But tell me, Do you
believe that such an uninterrupted Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of Ministers from the Apostles, is
absolutely necessary to the being of a
Church?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:109465:29"/>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>Yes verily, or else this Argument
signifies nothing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>How then can you convince me
or any other Christian, that you have had
such an uninterrupted Succession in your
Church? You must produce, and, it
seems, I must read all those many hundreds
of great Volumes wherein such passages
are mentioned. In those you must shew
me a perfect catalogue of the several
names of those Popes, and others who
have without interruption succeeded one
another ever since the Apostles days, and
this catalogue must be such that all your
Authors are agreed in, (whereas I am
told for certain, they differ very much in
their reports therein) and are not so much
as agreed among themselves who was <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
next Successor, (whether <hi>Linus</hi> or
<hi>Clemens,</hi> or some other person they know
not who,) and those Historians that report
these things, you must assure me that they
were infallible (which you do not pretend
they were) or else they might mistake
the things themselves, and mis-report
them to me; and I have heard and read
that there have been divers interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Schisms even in your Church, one
Pope set up against another, and each
pretending to be the true Pope, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annulling
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:109465:30"/>
all the Acts of the other, and
that the Christian people were then wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
divided, some cleaving to one, others
to another; but it may be this was a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
of our Ministers; therefore tell me,
Was this true or no?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>I confess it was true, after the year
of Christ 1300. there were several Popes at
the same time, one at <hi>Rome,</hi> another at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vignon.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>And how long did this difference
last?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>For about 50. years.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>And is it true that I have heard,
that your great</hi> Baronius <hi>reports that</hi> for
150 years together the Popes were rather
Apostates than Apostolicks, and that they
were thrust into the Papal Chair by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Harlots, and the violences of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Tuscany.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>I must be true to you, <hi>Baronius</hi> doth
say so at the year 897.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Then never hence forward be so
impudent to pretend to such a lawful, clear
and uninterrupted succession; but blush
that ever you mentioned it. But besides,
I have heard that divers of our first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
and reforming Ministers too, were
such as had received Ordination from and
in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and from your Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiops.
Is it true, or is it not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:109465:30"/>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>I will be ingenuous, Our Doctors
confess it; but if your Ministers, or some of
them had a call from our Church, yet they
were only called to Preach, not to overturn
the world (as they did) and to undertake the
Reformation of the whole Church.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>You have said enough: if they
were called to the Ministry, their Work
and Office was to bear witness to the
Truth; and therefore to undeceive the
world in those many Errors and Heresies,
which you had brought into the Church:
and Ministers are set for the defence of
the Gospel; they were therefore bound
by their Office to edeavour the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Church, and salvation of
Souls: and as in a great Fire (especially
where the publick Officers neglect their
Duty) every man brings his Bucket to
quench it; so, in that miserable estate,
into which you had brought the Church,
(when the Pope and Bishops would not do
their duty) it was the duty of every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
to endeavour, and to stir up the
Kings and Magistrates of the World to
endeavour a Reformation. Surely you
cannot pretend to an higher priviledge
than St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and yet he gives all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and Christians this leave and charge,
that <hi>if he himself should bring any other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:109465:31"/>
than what he had delivered,</hi> any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
(though happily such a one as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his calling from him) or Christian
might not only forsake him, but <hi>judge him
accursed.</hi> I shall only adde this, our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
are in a very hard case. I have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
with Anabaptists, who have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
against our Ministers as no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
because they had their calling from
<hi>Rome;</hi> and now you will make them no
Ministers, because they had no Calling
from <hi>Rome.</hi> (How shall they please you
and them too?) But what have you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to say?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>I have this further (which is indeed
unanswerable) namely, the horrible divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of, and in, your Churches: Here is Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an and Calvinist, Episcopal and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian,
Independent and Anabaptist, and
Quaker, and Socinian, and Familist: and
what not? so that a man that would turn to
your Church, knows not which to turn to:
but our Church is one and entire, at perfect
unity in it self.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>I pray you tell me in the first
place, are divisions a certain Argument
to prove any Church not to be true?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot say so; for it is plain, the
Iewish Church in Christs time was full of
Divisions; there were Pharisees, Sadduces,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:109465:31"/>
Essenes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so was the Church of
<hi>Corinth</hi> in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> time, while some said,
<hi>I am of Paul,</hi> others, <hi>I of Apollo,</hi> others,
<hi>I of Cephas;</hi> and some denyed <hi>Pauls</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
and Apostleship, and some denyed the
Resurrection.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Very well, then you may blush
to use such an Argument: I am told that
the old Heathens did use this very Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against the Primitive Christians.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>It is true, they did.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>What a shame is it that you are
forced to defend your cause with such
weapons as were used by the Pagans, and
wrested out of their hands by the Antient
Fathers?</p>
               <p>But besides, you talk of our Divisions,
I pray you let me ask you, will you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
me to father all the opinions of every
Papist, I read or talk with, upon your
Church?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>No, in no wise, Let our Church
speak for her self. It is one great fault of
your Ministers, they catch up every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Opinion of any Private Doctor, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
charge our Church with it; though it
be such as she hath condemned: whereas they
should judge of our Church only by her own
Decrees and Councils.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Very well, I desire only the same
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:109465:32"/>
justice from you; Do not father upon
our Church those Opinions which she
dislikes and abhors: Socinians, Quakers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are yours rather than ours, and joyn
with you in abundance of your Doctrins:
Judge of our Churches by their publick
Confessions; and there also you would
find, that our divisions are generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable,
being almost all about a
Form of Government, or oft-times, but
a manner of expression, and none of them
in fundamental Points. But since you
talk of Divisions, let me ask you, are all
the Members of your Church of one
mind? I have been told otherwise: We
hear great talk every day of the difference
between the Jansenists, and the Jesuits:
and (if we may believe either of them)
it is a Fundamental difference, and such
as concerns the very life of Religion. I
will not trouble you with other things:
But are you agreed in that, which is the
foundation of your unity, I mean, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Supream Infallible Judge of
Controversies? I remember your self told
me, that some of you thought it was the
Pope, and others a Council: And I have
read, that Popish Nations, and Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and Doctors, are all together divided
about it; and for the Pope, I have heard
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:109465:32"/>
that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> reckons up the several opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and amongst others, that the Pope
(if he be without a general Council)
<hi>may be an Heretick, and teach Heresie: and
this</hi> (saith he) <hi>is the opinion of divers Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
and is determined by a Pope himself,</hi>
Adrian <hi>the 6th by name, in his question a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Confirmation:</hi> Is this true, or is <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi>
bely'd?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>It is true, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> doth say so
much,<note n="*" place="bottom">De Pontific. <hi>l. 4. c.</hi> 2.</note> and moreover, that <hi>this opinion is
not heretical, and is tolerated by the
Church:</hi> but withall he tells you, that he is
of another opinion, which is also the common
opinion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>However, that is sufficient for
my purpose. This one difference among
you being far more considerable, than all
those points wherein Protestants differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves: for though they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in other and lesser things, they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in this great means of Union, that
they own the Holy Scriptures to be the
<hi>Iudge</hi> (or more properly the <hi>Rule</hi>) of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies:
and therefore if you please,
let this pass, and let me hear what further
you have to say against us, or for your
selves?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:109465:33"/>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>This further I say, the true Church
must needs remain visible perpetually to the
end of the world, such our Church hath been,
whereas yours was invisible and (as I said
before) unheard of in the world till <hi>Luthers</hi>
dayes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>I do not well understand you;
Do you think the Church must needs
be visible at all times to the whole
world?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot say so, for she was not
always visible to many great and famous parts
of the world, as <hi>China</hi> and <hi>America;</hi> it may
suffice, that she is visible in some Kingdom or
part of the world, and that she remains so in
all ages.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Then the Church may remain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
to the greatest part of the world,
and so your argument reacheth but a
small part of the world: How I pray
you must the Church be always visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>There must be in all ages, in some
eminent place, a great company of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
visibly united together, in the worship of
God in one body and Congregation, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by their successive Pastors under the

            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Very well: now I know your
mind: and first I deny, that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:109465:33"/>
for the true Church to be
so visible in all ages: Do you prove
it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>That I shall easily prove, from those
many and glorious promises made to the
Church; the Church is called a <hi>great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
and said to be <hi>exalted above other
mountains,</hi> Isa. 2. She is <hi>a City set upon
a hill that cannot be hid,</hi> Mat. 5. Christ
hath promised <hi>to be with her to the end
of the world,</hi> Mat. 28. <hi>The gates of Hell
shall not prevail against her; Christs
Kingdom, is an everlasting Kingdom,</hi>
Psal. 88. Dan. 2. A few invisible and
dispersed Christians, cannot make a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Your proofs are impertinent,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 2. doth prove that the Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the New Testament should be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
(that is spiritually) and prevalent:
so it was (and we trust will be) but he
saith not, the Church should always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in that condition (which is the point
that you should prove) <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. If it speak
of the Church, Christ only tells us what
the Church then was, not that it should
always remain such; besides he speaks
of their duty, not their condition: and
<hi>Mat.</hi> 28. proves that Christ will be with
his Church, but not so as that it shall
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:109465:34"/>
always be illustrious and united in a great
body: this, neither that, nor any of your
other Texts, prove, nor can you. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that Christ had made such a promise
that his Church should be visible in all
Ages in a considerable body; How do you
prove that our Church hath not been so
visible in all ages?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>If you affirm that it hath been vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
in all Ages, you are bound to produce a
Catalogue of your Churches in all successive
Ages.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>That is not necessary neither:
If I did positively affirm that our Church
had been visible in such manner in all
Ages, then I confess I am bound to prove
it. But if I leave it in doubt as a thing
which (for ought you or I know) might
be true or false, he that affirms it was
not so, is bound to make it good; and
if I deny your Proposition, by all Laws
of dispute, you must prove it: I will shew
by an instance how unconvincing your
argument is; There are several Prophesies
and Promises in Scripture, the execution
whereof is not recorded there, nor any
where else; suppose an Atheist comes to
you, and offers this Argument against the
Scripture; If the Scripture be true, and
the Word of God, then all its Prophesies
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:109465:34"/>
and Promises were accomplisht; but there
are several Prophesies and Promises there
which never were accomplished within
the time appointed, therefore it is not
true; What would you answer?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>I would deny this Proposition, <hi>viz.</hi>
That there are any such Prophesies or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
there which were not accomplisht.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Suppose then he urge it thus, If
they were accomplisht, then you must
shew when and how they were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisht
either in Scripture or other Stories,
if you cannot, I shall conclude they never
were accomplisht.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>I should tell him, That he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to shew they were not accomplisht, not
I to shew that they were accomplisht; I
should tell him that they might be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisht,
though the accomplishment of them
were never put into any writing (and being
but an Historical Tradition, might easily be
lost) or if it were put into writing, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
might be lost by the injury of time, as
thousands of other Books have been, so that
no prudent man will believe this mad Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
That nothing was done in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ages that was not mentioned in the
Records which we have. But if it were
possible that some particular things were not
recorded, or w<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re lost, yet it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:109465:35"/>
that so eminent and publick a matter as a
Succession of Churches should lie hid.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>I confess it is not so probable
that a large and glorious Church should
so lie hid; but since it was sufficient for
the making good of Christs promise of
being ever with his Church; if there
were some few Congregations and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
though scattered in divers places,
that these should not be recorded, is not
at all strange nor improbable to any one
who considers, 1. How many matters of
far greater note are recorded only in
some single Author, which if he had been
lost (and that he was as lyable to, as they
that were lost) the memory of those things
had perished with him. 2. How woful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dark and ignorant some ages of the
Church were, as you all confess, wherein
there was not much reading, but to be
sure, there was little or no writing. and
that little that was written, was written
by men of the times, who would not do
their Enemies that honour or right to put
them into their Histories: 3. If any did
mention such things, it is not at all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable,
that such Book or Books where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they were recorded, might either be
lost by the injury of time, (as thousands
of other Books were, which was much
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:109465:35"/>
more easie before Printing was found out,
or suppressed by the tyranny of your
Predecessors, who made it their business
(as <hi>Israels</hi> enemies of old) that the name
and remembrance of true Christians
might be blotted out of the earth. So
then, if Christ did indeed promise the
perpetual visibility of his Church, I will
conclude he made it good, though Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
be silent in the point; nor will I
conclude it was not done, because it is not
recorded: But I pray you let me further
ask you, Is it true that I am told, that in
the former ages there were many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
and Ministers whom your Church
did persecute and burn for Hereticks?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>That cannot be denyed.</p>

               <p>This shews there were not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

I have read in the History of

more general, for there is almost no Land in
which this Sect doth not creep. 3. That
whereas all others by the immanity of their
blasphemies against God, do make men abhor
them, these having a great shew of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
because they do live justly before men,
and believe all things well of God, and all
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:109465:36"/>
the Articles which are contained in the Creed,
only the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>they do blaspheme
and hate.</hi> Behold here out of your own
mouths, a plain Confutation of your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
and a testimony of the perpetuity,
amplitude, visibility, and sanctity of our
Church; for it is sufficiently known that
our Church and Doctrine is for substance
the same with theirs. Now tell me, I pray
you, if this History of them had been
lost, and no other mention of them made
in other Records, Had it been a truth for
you to affirm, that there never were any
such men and Churches in that time?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>No surely, for the recording of
things in History doth not make them true,
nor the silence of Histories about true Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
make them false.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Then there might be the like
Companies and Congregations in former
ages for ought you or I know; nor can
you argue from the defect of an History
to the denial of the thing: And all this I say
not as if there were no Records which
mention our Church in former Ages; for
as I said before, it is sufficiently evident,
that all our material Doctrines have been
constantly and successively owned by a
considerable number of persons in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Ages, but only that you may see
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:109465:37"/>
there is a flaw in the very foundation of
your Argument. Moreover, I finde in
Scripture several instances of such times
when the Church was as much obscured,
and invisible as ever our Church was, as
when <hi>Israel</hi> was in <hi>Egypt,</hi> so oft-times un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Judges, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 2. 3. and so under
divers of the Kings, as <hi>Ahab,</hi> when
<hi>Elijab</hi> complained he was left alone, and
the 7000. which were reserved, though
known to God, were invisible to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;
and under <hi>Ahaz</hi> and <hi>Manasseh,</hi>
and so in the <hi>Babylonish</hi> captivity: and so
under <hi>Antiochus;</hi> read at my desire, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi>
15. 3. 28. 24. 29. 6, 7. 33. 3, 4. so in the New
Testament, how obscure, and in a manner
invisible, was the Christian Church for a
season! Nay, let me add, this perpetual
visibility and splendour is so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a note of the true Church, that on
the contrary, it is rather a sign that yours
is not the true Church, as appears thus:
Christ hath foretold the obscurity and
smallness of his Church in some after
ages; he tells us that there shall be a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Apostasie and defection from the
faith, 2 <hi>Thess. 2. 1 Tim.</hi> 4. I read of
a woman, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. and she is forced to
flee into the Wilderness; and I am told
your own Expositors agree with us, that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:109465:37"/>
this is the Church which flees from Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
into the Wilderness, and secret
places, withdrawing her self from perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
Is this true?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>I must confess our Authers do t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

it so.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Then it seems you do not believe
your selves, when you plead the necessity
of perpetual visibility and splendour, for
here you acknowledge her obscurity;
and really this place and discourse of
yours does very much confirm me, that
that obscurity which you object against us,
is an argument that ours is the true Church
though, according to this Prediction, the
Pope this Antichrist, did drive our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors
into the Wilderness, I read of
<hi>a Beast rising out of the Sea.</hi> Revel. 13.
which your own Authors, <hi>Menochius, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus,</hi>
and almost all Expositors (as <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berus</hi>
saith) acknowledge to be Antichrist,
and this Beast <hi>all the Inhabitants of the
World do worship, except those whose names
are written in the Book of life,</hi> verse 8. that
is, excepting only the invisible Church;
if any Church be visible and glorious at
that time, it must be the false and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
Church; and now I speak of
that, I have heard that you your selves
confess, that in the time of Antichrist
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:109465:38"/>
the Church shall be obscure, and all
publick Worship in the Churches of
Christians shall be forbidden and cease:
Is it so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>It is true, it shall be so, <hi>i. e.</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time of Antichrists reign, as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
acknowledgeth<note n="*" place="bottom">De Pontif. l. 3. c. 7. Denique quod,</note>, but that is only for
a short moment, for three years and a half,
which is all the time that Antichrist shall
reign.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>I thank you for this, for now you
have exceedingly confirmed me in the
truth of my Religion; for since you grant
that the Church shall be obscured durings
Antichrist reign, I am very well assured
that your opinion of the Triennial reign of
Antichrist is but a meer dream, and that
he was to reign in the Church for many
hundred of years, for 1260 <hi>dayes, Rev.</hi> 11.
3. &amp; 12. 6. (that is, <hi>years,</hi> it being a very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
thing to put <hi>dayes</hi> for <hi>years,</hi> in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
Writings.) But if the Church may
be obscured for three years, why not for
thirty, yea, three hundred? Did Christ in
his supposed promise of perpetual Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
in the Church, make an exception
for these three years? I trow not: And
tell me, I pray you, should you live till
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:109465:38"/>
that time when Antichrist shall prevail,
and your Religion no less than ours be
obscure and invisible; if any of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Antichrist should dispute against
you, that yours was not the true Church
because not visible, Would you grant it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>God forbid I should be so wicked to
deny my Mother, and Church, because of her
Afflictions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Then I see you your selves do not
believe this to he a good argument, and
that you do not make perpetual visibility
a necessary token of the true Church.
To this I add, there is no need we should
shew a constant succession of Protestant
Churches ever since the Apostles dayes,
(as you pretend is necessary) the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that you pretend in your Church is
sufficient for ours, and so long as we ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
agree that your Church was a true
Church (till later years) though wofully
corrupted, and our Predecessors continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in it, till your wounds stunk and became
incurable, we need no other succession
than yours; but when your impiety came
to the height, then we visibly departed
from you, and have given such reasons for
it, as you will never be able to answer;
In the mean time let me hear what you
have further to say.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:109465:39"/>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>For as much as all your Ministers
confess our Church was once a true Church,
I pray you tell me how, and when she did
fall? you cannot tell either the time when
she fell, or the manner how, by Apostacy, or
Heresie, or Schism; if you can, name your
Authors.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>This is a most unreasonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
A friend of mine had the Plague
last year, and died of it I askt him when
he was sick, how and when he got it, he
said he knew not; Shall I then conclude
he had it not? Shall I make Christ a lyar,
and dispute that there were no tares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were <hi>sown when men slept,</hi> Mat.
13. 25. and so could not know when or
how they came? Shall I believe no He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie
to be an Heresie, unless I can shew
how and when it came into the Church?
What if the Records of these things by
the injury of time are lost, and their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
left in obscurity; shall I therefore
say, it is now become no Heresie? I
beseech you answer me freely this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
Suppose I could bring plain and
strong evidences from the holy Scripture,
and from antient Tradition, or the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
testimonies of the Antient Fathers,
that your Doctrine of Merits (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance)
is an Heresie, your Doctrine of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:109465:39"/>
worshipping Images is Idolatry; and that
you are in divers particulars apostatized
from that faith which the Scriptures and
Fathers do own; in this case, Would
you not confess, that you are guilty of
Idolatry, Heresie, and Apostasie?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>If it were so, and you could really
bring (as you falsely pretend you can, but
indeed cannot) any such solid proofs, I must
and will confess it: For all our Writers agree,
that although we must believe many things
that are not contained in the Scripture, yet
we must believe nothing contrary to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
nor to the consent of the antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Very well, hence then I gather
that the only question between you and
me is, Whether we can evidently and
solidly prove the particulars now menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
which if we can do, as I am satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
our Ministers have done, you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
in your own Conscience, and will
confess your self and your Church guilty
of Heresie, Idolatry, and Apostasie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I can tell the manner or time, or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of this doctrine or no.</p>
               <p>Therefore leaving these frivolous and
impertinent questions, let me hear what
you have to say more against our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and whereas your discourse I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:109465:40"/>
hath wholly run upon Generals, I
beseech you come to some particulars,
and shew me the falshood of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of our Church. But it doth not
a little confirm me in my Religion, that
you confess (as I shewed before) most of
our Doctrines to be true, and grounded
upon Scripture, whereas yours are addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of your own devising. Now if things
be thus, you shall not need to trouble
your self about many particulars. But
if you please single out some of our
principal Heresies, (as you call them) and
let me hear what evidences you can bring
against them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>Your Heresies are very many, but
I shall mention one which may be instead of
all, and that is your rule of Faith and Iudge
of Controversies, which you make to be the
Scripture only.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot,</speaker>
               <p>I am glad you have fallen upon
so material a point, the deciding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
may make other Disputes in great part
useless. Tell me then what you have to
say against this Doctrine.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>I will urge four Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it. 1. Scripture hath no authority
over us but from the Church. 2. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
know what Books are the holy Scriptures,
or part of it, but by the Churches report.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:109465:40"/>
3. If neither of these were true, yet Scripture
is not a sufficient rule for your faith without
Tradition. 4. If it were sufficient, yet it is so
obscure, that you cannot know the sense of it
without the interpretation of the Church. You
see here is a fourfold cord, which you will find
is not easily broken.</p>

Let me hear your Proofs.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>For the first then, I say, that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
hath no authority over us but from the
Church: neither you nor I are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Scripture to be the word of God, nor
can any man know it or prove it to be so, but
from the testimony of our Church concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>I pray tell me, if you were to
discourse with an Atheist, who utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
the holy Scriptures and the Church
too, Could you not prove against him
that the Scriptures are the Word of
God?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>God forbid, but that I should be able
to defend the truth of the Scriptures against
any adversary whatsoever.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>How then I pray you would you
prove it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>I need not tell you the Arguments
which in this case our Doctors use, and I
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:109465:41"/>
stand by them in it, they alledge for the truth of
the holy Scriptures the testimony of all ages
and all sorts of persons, the miracles wrought
for it acknowledged even by the Enemies of it,
the martyrdom, that so many thousands (and
many of them wise and learned men) did run
upon in the defence of them (who living so near
the time of the writing of them were best able
do discern the truth) and the wonderful pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
that goes along with them in convincing,
converting, and comforting or terrifying sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Do you believe these are solid
Arguments, and that the Atheist ought to
yield to them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>Yes doubtless, for every man is bound
to receive the truth, especially when it is so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
and proved to him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>It seems then by this, when you
list, you can prove the Scripture to be
the Word of God without taking in the
Churches Authority; I hope you will
allow me the same benefit. But again
let me ask you, your Church that you
talk of, which believes the Scripture to be
the Word of God; Doth she believe it to
be the Word of God upon solid grounds
or no?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>Yes doubtless, our Church is not so
irrational as to believe without grounds; nor
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:109465:41"/>
do we pretend Revelation, but she believes it
upon solid Arguments.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>I wish you would give me a list
of their Arguments: But whatever they
be that are sufficient to convince your
Church, why should they not be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to convince any private man, Popish
or Protestant, or Atheist? And therefore
there is no need of the Churches testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
Or will you say, the Church hath no
other sufficient reason to believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
but her own testimony, <hi>that is,</hi> she
believes because she will believe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>God forbid that I should disparage
the Church, or give Atheists that occasion to
scoff at the Stripture.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Then I also may be satisfied
without the Churches testimony, that the
Scriptures are the Word of God; and I
am so, by such Arguments as your self
mentioned; but really I cannot but smile
to see what cunning sophisters you are,
how you play at fast and loose: The same
Arguments for the Scriptures are strong
and undeniable when you talk with an
Atheist, and are all of a sudden become
weak as water when a Protestant brings
them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>But if you can prove in the General,
That the Scriptures are the Word of God,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:109465:42"/>
yet you cannnot without the Churches Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
tell what Books of Scripture, or which
are Canonical, and so you are never the

               <p>Here also I must ask you again,
How doth your Church know which
Books are Scripture and Canonical, doth
she know this by Revelation?</p>

the Books which you call Apocryphal, so that

if they be not, you are no less guilty in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

Whether these Books be a part of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>First then, for the judgment of
the Antient Church, let us try that; I

infallible, especially in matters of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;

               <p>We do so, and the Infallibility of the

one of our principal Arguments for the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility

               <p>Then only these Books of the old

               <p>Then your cause is lost, for it is

his Apostles did accuse them of breach

am told (and surely in all reason it must
needs be true) that the Canonical Books
of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church were written in the

               <p>What is true I will acknowledge; It

               <p>Either that Church did believe

if they did, then they lived in a mortal

               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>Well, what soever the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church
did, I am sure the Antient Christians and

the Canonical Scriptures.</p>

               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>I doubt I shall take you tardy
there too; I am told that the Council of
<hi>Laodicea,</hi> (in the year of our Lord 364.)
drew up a Catalogue of the Books of the
Scripture, in which (as in ours) the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal
Books are rejected.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>It is true, they did not receive them,
nor yet reject them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>If they did not receive them, that
undeniably shews that they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them to be Canonical, and yet they
diligently scanned the point, and the
Books had then been extant some hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of years, and they were far more
likely to know the truth than we at this
distance, having then such special oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of knowing the judgement of the
antient Church, both <hi>Iewish</hi> and <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:</hi>
Besides, I am informed that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Bishop of <hi>Sardis Melito,</hi> (a man of
great judgment and venerable holiness, as
your <hi>Sixtus Senensis</hi> saith) did take a

journey to the Eastern Churches (where
the Apostles principally preached) to
find out the true Canon of the Scripture,
and returned with the same Canon that
we own; but for the Apochrypha brought
home a <hi>Non est inventus:</hi> And moreover
that divers of your greatest Champions
do confess, that a great number of the
Antient Fathers were of our opinion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
which themselves reckon <hi>Melito,
Origen, Athanasius, Eusebius, Ruffinus,
Hierom,</hi> and <hi>Amphilocius,</hi> so say <hi>Canus</hi>
and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and <hi>Andradius;</hi> and in the

<hi>the Antient Fathers were of our opinion.</hi> Are
these things so?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>I will not deny the truth, it is so;
but you must know that other Fathers were
of another minde, as <hi>Clemens, Cyprian,</hi> and
<hi>Ambrose,</hi> and especially St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and the
Council of <hi>Carthage.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>The Fathers of our opinion, were
both far more numerous, and such as
lived nearest the Apostolical Times, and
Churches: The Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> was
more antient than that of <hi>Carthage,</hi> (and
therefore of greater Authority) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the sixth Council of <hi>Constantinople</hi>
doth expresly confirm all the Decrees of
the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> among which
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:109465:45"/>
this was one) and the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi>
too doth not your work: For in their
Catalogue there is both more than you
own, to wit, the third Book of <hi>Esdras,</hi>
(although they call it the second, as the
<hi>Greeks</hi> did) and less too, for they shut
out <hi>Baruch</hi> and the <hi>Maccabees;</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all this, I am told that very many of
your most eminent Doctors have disown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
these Books which we reject, as the
<hi>Parisian</hi> Divines, and Cardinal <hi>Ximenius,</hi>
with the <hi>Complutensian</hi> University, and
<hi>Aquinas,</hi> and <hi>Lyra,</hi> and <hi>Pagnim,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others. Is it so?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>I confess this is true.<note n="*" place="bottom">

true, he must have lived twice as long,
for he saith he was taken captive by <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manasser,</hi>
Chap. 1. and 2. and 14. and when
he was about to die, he saith, the time
was near for the return of the <hi>Israelites</hi>
from their Captivity, and the re-building
of the Temple which was burn'd: If the
Books of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> say true, <hi>Antiochus</hi>
his soul had a lease of his body for three
lives, and he was killed thrice over, (I
commend the Author, he was resolved
to make sure work of him.) 1. He dies at

is stoned in the Temple of <hi>Nanea, 2 Mac.</hi>
1. Lastly, he dyes in the Mountains

            <sp>

               <p>Such as these, the Doctrine of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,

though in my opinion when your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions

               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>First, then I note, you forsake your
cause, and it seems a writing is now made
a rule for your unwritten Traditions; if
it may be so, let me beg your favourable
opinion of the Apostles writings; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
those Writers which record these
Traditions, were they infallible?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>No, we do not hold any particular
Writers Infallible, especially not in matters
of Fact, such as reporting a Tradition or
use of the Church undoubtedly is.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Then they might mistake false
Traditions for true: Besides, how can I
tell what the Antient Doctors did agree
in, since most of them never wrote; and
many of their writings are lost; and yet
all of them had equal liberty of voting in
this case? besides, I have heard that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the Antient Fathers did report
several things to be Apostolical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
which your Church now reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
as <hi>that Infants should receive the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and that Christ should reign on earth
a thousand years,</hi> and many others: I am
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:109465:48"/>
told also, that your great <hi>Baronius,</hi> writing
concerning the Apostles, professeth, <hi>He
despairs to find out the truth, even in those
matters which true Writers have recorded;
because there was nothing which remained
sincere and incorrupted:</hi> Is it so?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>You shall find me ingenuous; it is

            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Then truly I shall bid Tradition
(in your sense) good night: For as to
your Traditions I see there is no certainty
in them. <hi>Shall I forsake the certain and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
verity of the Scripture for such
trash?</hi> God forbid.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Again, I pray you tell me, doth not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
wise man that makes any thing, make
it sufficient for its end? If you build an
house to live in, will not you make it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for that end? If a man makes a
Sword to cut with, a Coat of Male to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is he not a fool if he doth
not, if he can, make them sufficient for
their end and use?</p>

               <p>That must needs be granted.</p>

               <p>And was not our Instruction and

               <p>God himself tells me so, <hi>Iohn</hi>
20. 31. These things are written that you

               <p>S. <hi>John</hi> speaks there of Miracles, not of

               <p>He speaks of Miracles, which
were done in confirmation of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

not to be excluded: besides, I suppose
you will not say that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote the
Doctrines of Christ for one end, and the

appears, both that this was the end for

               <p>Whereas you pretend your
Church certainly knows the true sense of
the Scripture, and this Church you say
is the Pope, or a Council, and if these
be infallible, you say they are so in their
Decrees: If this be so, how comes it to
pass that none do more grosly mistake, and
mis-apply Scripture than divers of your
Popes and councils have done, even in
their Decrees, and decretal Epistles
(which you reverence as the Gospel)?
Your Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the first, proves his
Supremacy from that Text, <hi>Arise Peter
kill and eat:</hi> small encouragement to us
to become his sheep, if he so use them;
and from hence, that <hi>Peter drew to the shore
his net full of Fishes,</hi> your Pope <hi>Boniface</hi>
the eighth proves it from <hi>Gen. 1. 1. In the
beginning God created Heaven and Earth,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:109465:50"/>
therefore the Pope hath power in Temporals
and Spirituals: and this</hi> (saith he) <hi>you must
hold, unless with the Manichees you hold
two principles:</hi> And your councils are not
more happy Expositors. The council of
<hi>Lateran</hi> proves the Popes power from <hi>Psa.</hi>
72. (which speaks of <hi>Solomon</hi> and Christ)
<hi>All Kings shall fall down before him.</hi> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
council of <hi>Nice</hi> alledges these Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
for the Worship of Images, that
<hi>God created man in his own Image,</hi> Gen. 1.
<hi>Let me see thy countenance,</hi> Cant. 2. <hi>No
man when he hath lighted a Candle covereth
it under a vessel,</hi> Luk. 8. 16. In my opinion
they spoke like a council, expecting that
the world should receive their Decrees,
not for any solidity of Argument (that
had been pedantick) but meerly for the
Churches Majesty and Authority. Nay,
the jest is, when their Adversaries had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of these absurd impertinencies,
up steps <hi>Pater Noster,</hi> Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> and
he saith, he will maintain it (in spite of
fate) that they alledged them rightly and
excellently: So here we have a Pope and
council joyning together (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
undoubtedly infallible) in these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.
Nay, the council of <hi>Trent</hi> it
self (when one would expect they should
have grown wiser, though not better)
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:109465:50"/>
prove the unequal power of Popes, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and Priests, from <hi>Rom. 13. 1. The
powers that be are ordained of God; that is,
digested into order.</hi> I hope ere you have
done, you will put forth an entire Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the whole Bible, which I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
you will be the rarest book that ever
saw the light. But further, I desire to
know of you how your Church comes to
have this true and certain sense of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
hath she it by Revelation or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>No, we pretend to no such thing;
but she comes to know it by the diligent use of
means, by prayer, by reading, and comparing
Scripture, by consulting ancient Interpreters,
Analogy of Faith, the coherence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
even the Pope himself, when he set forth his
Translation of the Bible, He professes to all
the world, that he did it in the very same
manner, and by the same helps, that other
Translators do; that is, by advising with
learned Men, and consulting Antient Copies,
and the like<note n="*" place="bottom">Sixtus <hi>the</hi> Fifth, <hi>Pope, tells us in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to his Translation of the Bible, that</hi> He pickt out of the Cardinals, and almost out of all Nations, a Colledge of most learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men, who advised him in that work;
They (<hi>saith he</hi>) consulted, and I chose
that which was best. <hi>And he adds these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
words,</hi> It is most evident, that
there is no surer, nor stronger Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than the comparing of ancient and
approved Copies. <hi>And (he tells us) that</hi>
he carefully corrected it with his own
hands. <hi>And then the Pope imposeth this
Translation upon all the world,</hi> to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without adding or diminishing, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering,
under pain of Excommunication.
<hi>And yet (that you may see how they abuse the
peoples credulity to make them believe the
Popes Infallibility which themselves do not in
earnest believe.) About two years after comes</hi>
Clement <hi>the Eighth, and he puts forth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Edition and Translation of the Bible,
differing from, and contrary to the former E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in two thousand places, as Doctor</hi>
James <hi>hath proved, by producing the places,
as they are in</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">In his <hi>Bellum Papale,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it.</note> 
                     <hi>both E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.
And which is
more than all this, in
the Preface to his last Bible
of</hi> Clement <hi>the Eighth, we have these
words;</hi> Receive, Christian Reader, this old
and vulgar Edition of the Scripture cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
with all possible diligence, which,
though in respect of humane weakness it
be hard to affirm, that it is every way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat;
yet it is not to be doubted, but it
is more pure and corrected than all that
hath gone before it. <hi>I think this were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
evidence (if there were no other) how
great a cheat it is, that you pretend the Pope
to be the infallible Interpreter of Scripture.
For here we have one of those infallibles
directly contradicting and overturning the
other: and besides, instead of that Divine,
(or, after a sort divine) infallibility, which
you ascribe to the Pope, we have here a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
acknowledgment of his imbecillity: nor
dare he affirm his work to be perfect, which
it must needs have been, if he had been infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
guided in it (as you pretend he was) nor
would he have said so, if he had believed his
own infallibiliy.</hi>

               <p>Very good, Then I pray you tell

the Pope himself.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>The reason is plain, because the Pope
is guided by the infallible assistance of Gods
Spirit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>You ought not to rant at this
height, until you have solidly answered
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:109465:52"/>
what our Divines have wrote against
this Infallibility. And I heard before the
woful weakness of your arguments; for it
is to me the vainest thing in the world to
pretend a promise of the Spirit of God
infallibly to guide such men, as (if the
Scripture be true) have not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christ in them, being (as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
many of your Popes and Bishops
were) <hi>sensual, not having the Spirit:</hi> and
having apparently no other spirit in
them, but the spirit of the world, the
spirit that lusteth to envy and all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
But since you pretend the Scripture
is so dark, I pray you tell me, what was
the end for which God designed the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture?
Sure I think it was for our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;
my Bible tells me, that <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
things were written aforetime, were
written for our learning, Rom.</hi> 15. 4 But if
you say true, it seems God meant only to
put forth riddles: Gods Law was design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him for <hi>a light, and that even to the
simple,</hi> Psal. 19. 7, 8, 9. and 119, 105.
And in a word, the Gospel is so clear, that
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> pronounceth, <hi>it is hid from none
but them that perish,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 3, 4. And
Saint <hi>Luke</hi> wrote his Gospel, that <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi>
(and with him other Christians)
<hi>might know the certainty of those things
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:109465:52"/>
wherein they had been instructed,</hi> Luke 1. 4.
and generally every discreet man that
writes a Book, writes it so, as it may be
understood; especially if it be for the
benefit of the ignorant, as well as the
learned (which the Scripture assuredly
was.) Tell me then I pray you, why
should God write his mind so darkly and
doubtfully as you know whose Oracles
are said to be delivered? was it because
God could not write plainer (and wanted
the gift of utterance) or because he would
not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
               <p>Notwithstanding all this, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,

            <sp>

               <p>I do not deny this: but those
things which are obscurely delivered in
one place, are more clearly delivered in
another; and those dark places generally
are about Prophecies, and such other
things; the knowledge of which is not
necessary to salvation, But for necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

                  <p>1. That your Church declines all

Judgment but her own, and makes her self
Judge in her own Cause; you do not allow
Scripture to be Judge, nor the Antient
Fathers (for all your talk of Antiquity)
nor indeed any but your selves, the Pope,
or a Council of your own, and your
Church it seems must determine, whether
she be a true Church or no, and whether
she be pure or corrupted, or whether
she be Infallible or no; Is this so?</p>

Judge (though they might as justly and
reasonably do it as you) but they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
willing to submit to other Judges,
they refer themselves to be judged by
the Scripture, which is acknowledged to
be a most indifferent Judge; If that do
not please you, they refer themselves to
the Fathers for the first six hundred
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:109465:54"/>
years, till your abominations had leaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the world, according to what was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 8.</p>
                  <p>II. My second consideration is this;
You do not only decline the Scriptures
judgment, but you infinitely disparage and
vilifie it. I meet with several passages quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out of your Authors to that purpose.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>Possibly you may out of some incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
ones, but not out of any of note and
name in our Church.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, out of your prime Authors,
I read that Cardinal <hi>Hosius</hi> in his <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement
to King Sigismund</hi> hath this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
<hi>If they</hi> (that is, the Hereticks)
<hi>say, It is written, that is the voice of the
Devil, speaking in his members</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">De expresso Dei Verbo.</note>. But
that it is below a Cardinal to read the
Bible, he would have found the words
also in Christs mouth. I read that <hi>Coste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
calls the Scripture by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<hi>Paper and Parchment. God</hi> (saith
he) <hi>would no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

always understand the Papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
<hi>now depend upon Paper and Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as</hi> Moses <hi>made the carnal</hi> Israelites:
And again, <hi>That which is written in the
heart of the Church, doth by many degrees
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:109465:55"/>
excel the Scriptures: First, because that
was written by the finger of God, but this by
the Apostles</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Enchiridion, cap. 1.</note>, as if the Writings of the
Apostles were only a device of man. I
read that Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> writing to <hi>Henry</hi>
the Eighth, saith thus, <hi>What an absurd
thing is this, that thou dost attribute more
authority to the Scripture than to the Church,
since the Scripture hath no authority but for
the decree of the Church</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="bottom">De primatu Romanae Ecclesiae, fol 92.</note>? (He means
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.) I see we are highly
concerned to please your Church, else we
are like to have no Scriptures. I read that
<hi>Pighius</hi> saith, <hi>The Apostles did never intend
to subject our faith to their writings, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their writings to our faith</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="bottom">Eccles. Hierarch. lib. 2. cap. 2.</note>. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
he saith, <hi>The Scriptures are (as
one said, not more pleasantly than truly) a
nose of wax which suffers it self to be drawn
hither or thither, as a man pleaseth</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="bottom">Ibid. l. 3. c. 3. fol. 103.</note>. I
read that <hi>your Bullenger</hi> saith; <hi>The Scripture
is the Daughter, the Church the Mother,
which gives being and sufficiency to her she
begets.</hi> (No wonder then, the Church
makes bold with the Scripture to add, or
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:109465:55"/>
alter, or dispense with it. We all know
the Mother may correct the Daughter.)
I confess, when I read those passages
produced by our Writers, I suspected
they wronged them. Are these things
true?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>I acknowledge it, and it is a vain
thing for me to deny it, for the Books and
those passages in them are extant under their
own hands: And I must confess, these Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
are as considerable and approved as any
we have. But you ought to put a favourable
sense upon them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>I would not strain them, nor
make them worse than they are. Take
them as you will, they are abominable
expressions, and (to me) a great evidence,
that the Scripture is no friend to your
Church. And I conclude this to be one
accomplishment of what Christ hath said,
<hi>Every one that doth evil hateth the light,
neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds
should be reproved,</hi> John 3. 20. And if this
be the spirit by which your Church is
guided, I am sure it is not the Spirit of
God and of Truth; for that teacheth men
reverence and love to the Scriptures:
You seem to do like <hi>Herod,</hi> who being
convinced that he was not of the Royal
race of the <hi>Iews,</hi> did burn their Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:109465:56"/>
and Records, that his false pretences
might not be confuted by them. And just
so do you endeavour to do by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures:</p>
                  <p>III. My third Consideration against
your Religion is this; That your Cause
is such as dares not abide tryal: This is
the honour and happiness of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
We are allowed to examine all that
our Ministers say, and we have a Rule
(which we may peruse) to try them by,
<hi>viz.</hi> the holy Scriptures, which you dare
not suffer your people to read. And this
I take to be a secret confession of your
guilt; and I am told your <hi>Alphonsus de
Castro</hi> saith, <hi>That from the reading of the
Scripture all Heresies come</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Contra haereses, l. 5. c. 6.</note>.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>I think your experience hath justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that expression, You see what you get by
the reading of the Scriptures, even this, that
you are crumbled into a thousand Sects.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>Our Saviour was not of your
mind, for he thought not acquaintance
with, but ignorance of the Scriptures
was the cause of Error; <hi>Ye erre, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scriptures,</hi> Mat. 22. 29. Nor did
he only allow, but command the <hi>Iews</hi> to
<hi>search the Scriptures,</hi> without any fear of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:109465:56"/>
this inconvenience, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 39. Had
S. <hi>Paul</hi> been of your mind, he would
not have commended, but reproved the
<hi>Beraans</hi> for searching the Scriptures, and
examining his Doctrine by them, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.
11. If any of your people should do as
the <hi>Beraeans</hi> did, they would be sent to the
Inquisition. I do not deny, but too many
make a bad use of the Scripture, and
wrest it to wicked purposes, which is
to me no better an argument than this;
Wine makes many men drunk, therefore
no Wine must be sold. The Doctrine of
Free Grace was abused by thousands (as
we read) therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> did ill in
preaching of it. The light of the Sun
hurts sore eyes, therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> was
mistaken, when he said, <hi>It is a pleasant
thing to behold the Sun.</hi> But since you
speak of this, I pray you let me ask you
one question; Were not most of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies
that ever were in the Church,
brought in by learned men?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>I cannot deny that, for it is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
known.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>Then you shut up the wrong
door; for, it seems, it is not the unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
mans reading, but the learned mans
perverting the Scripture, which is the
true cause and fountain of Heresies:
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:109465:57"/>
And besides, you must not do evil, that
good may come out of it, nor defraud
people of their greatest treasure, nor keep
them from their duty, for fear of some
inconveniencies. This is to make your
selves wiser than God.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>But indeed you slander us in this
point: We do not absolutely forbid reading
of the Scriptures. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
it, provided you can get the Bishops
leave.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prot,</speaker>
                  <p>It is true, that Council pretends
to give some such liberty; but they take
away with one hand, what they gave with
the other; for in their Index of forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Books, they have this passage: <hi>Since
experience sheweth that the promiscuous read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Bible brings more evil than good,
therefore if any man shall dare to read, or
have a Bible without license from the Bishop,
or Inquisitor, he shall not be capable of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">In fine <hi>Concil. Trident. Reg.</hi> 4.</note>
                     <hi>unless he part with his Bible.</hi> But
in truth, this pretended License is but an
handsome blind: For in that very place
there is this Observation added to that
Rule, That <hi>the power of giving such Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censes
of reading, or keeping the vulgar Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
is taken away from such Bishops and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:109465:57"/>
Inquisitors, by the command and usage of
the</hi> Roman <hi>and universal Inquisition.</hi> At
best, it seems, I must not obey Christs
command of <hi>searching the Scriptures,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the Bishop give me leave. But I pray
you tell me; Do your people use to ask,
and the Bishops to give them leave to
read the Bible?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will not dissemble with you, They
do not. And, the truth is, an approved
Writer of ours,</hi> Ledesima <hi>puts the question;</hi>
What if a man should come to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
and desire liberty to read the Bible,
and that with a good intention? <hi>to which
he replies, that</hi> the Bishop should answer
him in the words of Christ, <hi>Matt.</hi> 20. 20.
Ye know not what ye ask, and Indeed
(<hi>saith he, and he saith it truly</hi>) the root
of this demand is an heretical dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note n="*" place="bottom">De Sacris vernaculis.</note>.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>Then I perceive in this, as well
as in other things, you are more careful
to deceive people with pretences, than
to inform them. But indeed, you tell
me no more than I had read, or heard
out of your own Authors. It was the
speech of your Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> That <hi>the
Mountain which the Beasts must not touch
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:109465:58"/>
is the high and holy Scriptures which the
unlearned must not read</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Cap. cum ex injuncta. Extra de haeres.</note> and your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
commonly affirm, that people must
not be suffered to read the Scriptures,
because <hi>we must not give holy things to Dogs,
nor cast Pearls before swine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My fourth General consideration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
your Religion is this, That it
grosly contradicts the great designs and
ends of the Christian Religion, which all
confess to be such as these, the glorifying
of God, and his Son Jesus Christ, and the
humbling and abasing of men, the beating
down of all sin, and the promoting of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
holiness. Are not those the chief
ends of Religion?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>I do freely acknowledge they are,
and our Religion doth most answer these
ends.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>That you and I will now try
And for the first: Your Religion doth
highly dishonour God sundry ways. What
can be a greater dishonour to God,
than to make the holy Scriptures (which
you confess to be the Word of God) to
depend upon the Testimony and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of your Pope, or Church, and to
say, that the Word of God is but a dead
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:109465:58"/>
letter, and hath no authority over us
without their Interpretation and Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation;
By which means malefactors
(for such all men are, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 9, 10. your
Pope not excepted) are made Judges of,
and superiour to that Law whereby they
are condemned. Tell me; would not
the <hi>French</hi> King take it for a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour,
if any of his Subjects should say,
That his Edicts and Decrees had no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over his People without their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation?</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>Just so you deal with God: and
what can be a fouler dishonour to God,
than that which your great <hi>Stapleton</hi>
affirmed, and <hi>Gretser</hi> and others justified,
and your Church to this day have never
disowned it: <hi>That the Divinity of Christ
and of God</hi> (in respect of us) <hi>depends upon
the Authority of the Pope?</hi>

more dishonourable to God than what

that is, in plain terms, the Pope is to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed

dishonorable to God, to give the Worship
which is proper to God, unto the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
I confess the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> hath
convinced me of it, <hi>Isa. 42, 8. I am the

                  <p>I also am of the same mind; but
it is a scandal of your Ministers, to say we

God (for he knew he was but Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster)
yet <hi>Peter</hi> durst not receive it. It was
an inferiour Worship which the Devil

which Christ saith God hath forbidden, to
be given to any Creature. You are a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant

you, do you not worship the Bread in the

                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>We do so, and that upon very good

                  <p>In like manner, to that which
the Apostle there saith, <hi>there is but one
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:109465:60"/>
God;</hi> it might be said, there are other
secondary gods, and so we might intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Heathen gods into the Church.
It is the great Prerogative of Jesus
Christ, that he is the Redeemer of the
World; yet your <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to communicate this honour to the
creature, and expresly saith, <hi>It is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd,
that holy men be called our Redeemers
after a sort</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>De indulgentiis,</hi> cap. 4. <hi>sub finem.</hi>
                     </note>, and more of the like stuff
we shall meet with before we part: yet
again, your Religion as it depresseth God,
so it exalts the creature. I will instance
but in one thing, and that is your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Justification by the merit of
good works: A doctrine, which S. <hi>Paul</hi>
affirms, gives unto a man matter of boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and glorying, Rom. 3. 27. <hi>Where is
boasting then? it is excluded, By what
Law? of Works? Nay, but by the Law of
Faith,</hi> &amp; Rom. 4. 2. <hi>For if Abraham were
justified by works, he hath whereof to glory.</hi>
Next, you grant, That it is the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
and intent of Religion, to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and beat down sin, which your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
doth exceedingly incourage by
your Doctrines and Practice in Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Indulgences. In my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:109465:61"/>
I have known several Papists that
have wonderfully encouraged themselves
in their wicked wayes from this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
especially when <hi>Easter</hi> drew near,
because they knew they should very sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
be shriven, and absolved, and be
(as they said) as sound and clean as when
they came first into the world. I have
known also divers of our loose Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
that have turn'd to your Religion,
that they might have greater liberty for,
and the security in sin; and in my Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
If I would let my lusts choose a
Religion for me, they would presently
lead me to your Religion: And so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
your Religion doth not at all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
serious holiness, but the soul and
spirit of it is dwindled away into meer
formality: What can be of more pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
consequence to true holiness than to
tell a man, that the saying so many <hi>Pater-Nosters,</hi>
or <hi>Ave-Maries,</hi> (though it may
be he is talking, or gazing about in the
midst of his Devotions) will procure him
acceptance with God? Is it true, that
your great and devout Doctor <hi>Suarez</hi>
saith, That <hi>is it not essential to Prayer, that
a man should think of what he saith?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:109465:61"/>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>It is true, he doth say so in his Book
of Prayer.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>Then I confess, your Religion
hath the advantage of ours, for a man
may do two businesses at once: It hath set
me much against your Religion, since I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
that you turned that great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Repentance into a meer forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
What a sad Doctrine is it that your
great Masters teach, that Repentance is
not necessary at all times, but only on Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-daies,
(as some of your Authors say)
only once in a year, that is, at <hi>Easter</hi>
(as others.) Nay indeed, once in all his
life, and that in danger of death (as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var,</hi>
and <hi>Cajetan</hi>)? what an encouragement
is this to wickedness, to tell men that a
thousand of their sins are venial, which
though not repented of, will not exclude
them from the favour of God, and from
Salvation; but I will rake no farther into
this kennel.</p>
                  <p>I think this may serve turn, to let you
see, that I had warrant to say, That your
Religion contradicts the design, and end of
all Religion.</p>
                  <p>V. The fifth Consideration that sets
me against your Religion, is the desperate
issues that you are driven to in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:109465:62"/>
of your Cause; as for example, in
the great point of Infallibility, I observe
your learned Doctors are beaten out of
all their former Assertions and Opinions;
you have been driven from Scripture to
the Fathers, from them to the Pope,
from him to a Council, and thence to the
Pope with a Council, and (as a further
sign of a desperate cause) the Jesuits are
brought to that exigence, that they are
forced to affirm the Pope to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in matters of fact, which is confessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a new, upstart, and indeed, monstrous
Opinion; and yet those piercing wits
see their cause cannot be defended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it: and others seeing the vanity of
all their former pretences, have been
forced to resolve all into the present
Churches testimony.<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Nullity, Chap</hi> 5.</note> So for the point
of Idolatry, you are driven to those
straits, that you cannot excuse your selves
from Idolatry, but by such pretences as
will excuse both Jewish and Gentile Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters;
and one of your ablest Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
is brought to this plunge, that he is
forced to affirm, that <hi>some Idolatry is
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:109465:62"/>
lawful</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Greg. de Valentiâ.</note>: I might instance in very many
others, but I forbear.</p>
                  <p>VI. A sixth consideration is taken
from the partiality of your Religion;
That Religion which is from God, is
doubtless agreeable to the Nature and
Will of God. But so is not your Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for it is guilty of that respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
which Scripture every where denies
to be in God, <hi>Act. 10. 34. Rom.</hi> 2. 11.
<hi>Iob</hi> 34. 19.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>How is our Religion guilty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of persons?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>I might shew it in many things,
but I will confine my self to one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;
and that is, in point of Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
The Souls of all that die in venial
sins, are doomed to those terrible pains
of Purgatory, there to continue none
knows how long (by the way, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but take notice of the great unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of those Christians, that lived and
died in the dayes of Christ and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
that have been multitudes of them
frying in Purgatory to this day, and are
like to be so as long as the World lasts;
whereas those that live nearer the end
of the World, must needs have a far shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
abode there, so men are punished
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:109465:63"/>
with continuance of their torments, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the circumstance of time of their
birth; but this is not the thing I aim at,)
from these pains of Purgatory, there is no
way to deliver a man but by indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and these indulgences must be
bought off with money, and wealthy
men may buy off those corporal pains,
(which the rascal herd must suffer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
bail or main-prise) and turn them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a fine of the purse. So I see it was not
without reason, that <hi>Solomon</hi> said, <hi>Money
answers all things.</hi> I have heard that your
tax of the Apostolical Chancery (put
forth by the Authority of your Church,
where there is a price put upon all indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,
and upon all kinds of sins) hath
this expression, <hi>Diligently note, that these
graces</hi> (of Indulgences) <hi>are not given to
the Poor, because they are not, and therefore
cannot be comforted</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Diligenter nota quod eujusmodi gratia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> non dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. pauperibus, <hi>quia non sunt,</hi> ideo non possunt
consolari. Taxa Cancellariae Apostolicae. <hi>Tit. De Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniali.</hi>
                     </note>; by which I see,
that if St. <hi>Peter</hi> himself should rise from
the dead, and come to his Successour,
with his old tone, <hi>Silver and Gold have I
none,</hi> if he were a thousand <hi>Peters,</hi> he
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:109465:63"/>
must into Purgatory without mercy. I
am told that another of your Authors,
<hi>Augustinus de Ancona,</hi> an Author of great
note with you, tells us, <hi>that Indulgences are
for the relief of the Churches</hi> (that, is the
Popes, and their Prelates) <hi>Indigencies,
which</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="bottom">Nam Indulgentiae fiunt ad relevandam indigenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Ecclesiae, quae non relevatur per solam voluntatem dandi, sed per datum. <hi>De Potestate Papoe, quest. 30. art.</hi> 3.</note> 
                     <hi>is not relieved by a willingness to
give</hi> (which is all that any poor man can
pretend to) <hi>but by the gift it self.</hi> (It seems
your Church is not of Gods minde; for,
if <hi>there be a willing mind, he accepteth it for
the deed, 2 Cor.</hi> 8. 12.) And a little after
(as I am told) he saith, <hi>as to the remission of
punishment which is procured by indulgences,
in that case it is not inconvenient, that the rich
is in a better condition than the poor, for there
it is not said, come and buy without money</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="bottom">Quantum ad remissionem poenae quae acquiritur per indulgentiam, in tali causa non est inconveniens quod dives, sit melioris conditionis quâm pauper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ibi enim non dicitur, Venite &amp; emite sine,pecuniâ. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                     </note>.
I confess that were a dangerous speech,
and would utterly undoe all the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi> It is sufficient that <hi>Isaiah</hi> once said
it, and Christ again, <hi>come and drink freely.</hi>
People should have been wise, and taken
them at their word, for they are never
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:109465:64"/>
like to hear it a third time. Is this true?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>They do indeed say so; and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of our Church manifests to all the world,
that Indulgences are sold for money, and the
condition of the rich, in that, is better than
the poor. But what great matter is that, as
to the Pardon of Sin, and eternal Life, or
Death, both rich and poor are alike. This dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is only as to the pains of Purgatory.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>Is that nothing to you? you speak
against your own, and all mens sense: we
see how highly men esteem to be freed
from a painful, though short, disease here;
how much more to be freed from such
pains as you all confess to be unspeakably
more sharp and grievous, than all the pains
that ever were endured in this world: It
is so considerable a thing, that I assure
you, it is to me matter of wonder (if
Christ and the Apostles had been of your
minde) how it came to pass so unluckily,
that the poor only should receive the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;
whereas, if the men of that Age
had not been all Fools, the rich would
have been most forward to entertain it.</p>
                  <p>VII. But to proceed. My seventh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
against your Religion is taken
from its great hazard, and utter uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.
According to the doctrine of your
Church, no man can be sure of his salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:109465:64"/>
(without a revelation) but he must
go out of the world, not knowing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he goes. Indeed there is nothing but
hazard and uncertainty in your Religion;
I suppose you grant that all your Faith, and
consequently your salvation depends upon
the infallible Authority of your Church.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>That is most certain.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>Are you then infallibly certain,
that your Church is infallible, or do you
only probably believe it?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>I am but a private Priest, and
therefore cannot pretend to Infallibility; but
I am fully satisfied in it, that the Church is
infallible in it self.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>Then I see you pretend to no
more certainty than I have; for I know
(and you grant) that the Scripture is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
in it self: and I know its infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
as certainly as you know the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
of your Church. But, I pray you
tell me, what is your opinion? I know
your are divided: but where do you place
the infallibility, or where do you lay the
foundation of your Faith?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>To deal freely with you, I place it in
the Pope; who when he determines things <hi>out
of his Chair,</hi> is infallible: for S. <hi>Peter</hi>
who was supream Head of the Church, left
the Pope his Successour.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>Then it seems your Faith doth
wholly depend on these things, that Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and died there,
and that he left the Pope his successour in
his supream and infallible Authority.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>It doth so.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>How then are you infallibly assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of the truth of these things, which are
all matters of Fact?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>Because they are affirmed by so many
of the Ancient Fathers and Writers.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>Were those Fathers or Writers
infallible persons?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>No.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>Then might they, and so may you,
be mistaken in that point; and so indeed
you have nothing but a meer conjecture
for the foundation of your Faith. But
again, are you infallibly sure, that Saint
<hi>Peters</hi> intention was to leave his Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to the Pope? For I do not read that
S. <hi>Peter</hi> left it in his last wil. I tell you true
it is strange to me, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> should
write two Catholick Epistles, and (as I
observed before) not leave one word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this matter. For my part I shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
rather question the Popes Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
than S. <hi>Peters</hi> fidelity or discretion, in
omitting so Fundamental a Point when he
put in many of far less concernment. But
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:109465:65"/>
further, I demand, How are you assured
that St. <hi>Peter</hi> intended to leave his power,
and did actually leave it to his Successors?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>By the unanimous consent of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>I wonder at your confidence, that
you dare affirm a thing which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Maulin, Reinolds</hi> against <hi>Hart,</hi> and others.</note>have so clearly proved to be false.
But suppose it were so, that the Fathers
had said it; tell me, are the Fathers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible?
at least are they so in their reports
of matter of Fact?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>No: we confess that it is only the Pope
or Council that are infallible, not the Fathers;
&amp; to be true to you, even the Pope himself is
not infallible in his Reports of matters of Fact.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>Then you have nothing but a meer

already,</hi> Thou are Peter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Simon, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
I have prayed that thy Faith fail not,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>I have already shewn how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdly
these Texts are alledged. But I
beseech you, how is the Pope infallibly
assured that this is the true meaning of
those Texts? You confess it is not by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>He knows that, by considering and
comparing Scripture with Scripture, and by
consulting the Fathers, and Prayer, Diligence,
and Obedience, &amp;c.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>All these things are very good,
but any other man may use these means as
well as the Pope, and hath as full promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
from God, as any the Pope pretends to
as <hi>Ioh. 7. 17. If any man will do his will, he shal
know of the doctrine, whether it be of God;</hi> and
the Spirit of Truth is promised to all that
ask it, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 13. So if this be all you
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:109465:66"/>
have to say, God deliver my soul from
such a desperate Religion, wherein all the
certainty of its Faith depends upon his
infallibility, that is not certain of his own
infallibility.</p>
                  <p>But I need say no more of this; It is to
me an undeniable argument, that there is
no certainty at all in this foundation; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(as you confess) so many hundreds of
your ablest Schollars do utterly reject it.
But once more, in my opinion you run a
dreadful hazard in the point of worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Creaturers, Images, Saints, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
the Bread in the Sacrament, in
which you run other hazards besides those
I spoke of. I am told, that your Doctrine
is this, That it is necessary to the making
of a Sacrament (and so to the conversion
of the Bread into Christs Body) that the
Priest intend to consecrate it. Is it so?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes doubtless, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and all our
Authors largely dispute for that.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>And can I be sure of another
mans intentions? It is sufficiently known,
that divers of your Priests are prophane,
and atheistical wretches, others envious
and malicious, and some actually Jews.
What assurance have I, that my Priest is
not such an one, and that he doth not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of a contempt or hatred of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:109465:67"/>
or malice against my person, intend
to deceive me, and not make a Sacrament
of it? Sure I am, they intend to deceive
their people in the preaching of the
Word, and why they may not do so in the
Administration of the Sacrament, I know
not.</p>
                  <p>VIII. My eighth and last general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
is this, that your Religion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys
even the principles of morality:
which true Religion is so far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying,
that it improves and perfects it.
I confess, the bloodiness of your Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath ever made me both suspect and
loath it. I find that Christ is a Prince of
peace; though he whipt some out of the
Temple yet he never whipt any into
his Church; that he drew in his Disciples
with the cords of a man, of conviction
and perswasion; and so did his Apostles
after him: but your Religion (like <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co's</hi>
laws) is written in blood. I perceive
you answer our Arguments with Fire and
Faggot: besides this, your Religion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes
all civil Faith and Society; your
principle is known, and so is your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of equivocation, and keeping no
faith with Hereticks.</p>

because of <hi>John Husse</hi> who after he had the

                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>This I say you must not charge upon
our Church, the opinion of some few private
Doctors, since others disown this, and have

                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>It seems it is a disputable point
among you, whether you ought to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
or not: but I have heard that <hi>Iohn
Husse</hi> was condemned by the Council of
<hi>Constance,</hi> and that when the Emperour
scrupled to break his Faith, they declared
he might do it, and ought to do it. Is it
so?</p>

                  <p>And you hold Councils (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
where the Pope joyns with them as
he did with that Council) to be infallible;
and therefore this I may confidently
charge upon you as a Principle of your
Religion. I cannot but observe your fine
devices: At other times when we alledge
passages out of any of your learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
which make against you, you tell us
they are but private Doctors, and we must
judge of you by your Councils. Now

                  <p>These discourses of yours are only

                  <p>You shall find me ingenuous and
docible, only remember I expect not
words, but solid Arguments. I think our

points of your Religion, and examine
them; for the rest will either stand or fall

                  <p>First then, if you please, we
will begin with the sacrifice of the Mass,
which you say is essential to the Christian
Religion.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is so, and</hi> Bellarmine <hi>rightly

no Religion.</p>

                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>Therefore, I pray you, let me
hear one or two (for those are as good as

                  <p>I approve your motion, and I shall
only insist upon two Arguments: First, the
Sacrifice of the Mass was appointed by God,
or Christ, in the words of Institution of the
Sacrament, <hi>do this in remembrance of
me.</hi> It is the great Argument of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent</hi>

                  <p>I adore the fruitfulness of your
Churches Invention. It seems they think
these two words, <hi>do this,</hi> contain no less
than two of your Sacraments, to wit, that
of <hi>Orders,</hi> which makes Priests, and that
of the <hi>Supper.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>They do so.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>That, no sober man will easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
nor that Christs meaning in the
words mentioned was this, <hi>Sacrifice me in
remembrance of me.</hi> But let me hear how
you prove the Institution of the Mass
from these words.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>Christ bid his Disciples, <hi>do this,</hi> viz.
that which he did: Christ did in that last
Supper truly and properly offer up himself to
his Father, his Body under the shape of Bread,
his Blood under the shape of Wine; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were truly and properly to offer up, or
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:109465:69"/>
Sacrifice Christ in the Sacrament. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is <hi>Bellarmin's</hi>

                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>How do you prove that Christ
did in that last Supper truly and properly
offer up his Body and Blood to his Father?
I read that <hi>Christ offered himself but once,</hi>
Heb. 8. 27. and 9. 25, 26, 27, 28. and
10. 14. and that was upon the Cross; nor
do I find that he offered any thing at all
to God in that Supper, but only to his
Apostles: And what, did Christ Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
himself, and imbrue his hands in his
own Blood; and did he eat up his own
Body? did he take his whole Body into
his Mouth? these are Monsters of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
But how prove you that Christ did
then offer up himself to God?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>Because Christ speaks in the present
tense, <hi>This is my Body which is broken,
Blood which is shed:</hi> he doth not say which
<hi>shall be</hi> broken, and shed; and therefore it
must be broken and shed at that very time.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>What a vain Argumet is this?
you know nothing is more usual in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
than to put the Present Tense for
the Future. Christ saith, <hi>I do lay down my life</hi>
when he means, I will do it shortly, <hi>Iohn</hi>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:109465:69"/>
10. 15. <hi>I do go to my Father, Iohn</hi> 16. 28.
that is, I shall go shortly: <hi>Do that thou dost,</hi>
that is, <hi>art about to do,</hi> John 13. 27. And
in <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. Christ saith of his Blood, <hi>This
is my Blood which is shed for many for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sins;</hi> and yet I suppose it was not
shed at that time; for you all profess the
Sacrifice of the Mass is an unbloody Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:
But again, tell me, I pray you,
when Christ said, <hi>do this,</hi> did they not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
Christs command at that Supper?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>I cannot deny that.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>Thence unavoidably follows, that
this <hi>doing</hi> concerns the Communicants, as
well as (if not more than) the Minister;
and so it is not meant of Sacrificing
Christ, but receiving of him; and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if this Text do not, there is no other
which doth, enjoyn Communicants to
receive; which he that can believe,
hath got a good mastery over his Faith:
Besides, what Christ here commands his
Apostles, I finde St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands the
Corinthians, and expounds <hi>doing this</hi> by
<hi>eating and drinking,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
if the words <hi>do this,</hi> were the words
which did ordain both <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice,</hi>
who can think that two of the Evangelists,
<hi>viz.</hi> both <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> would have
omitted them in mentioning the words of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:109465:70"/>
Institution; and therefore this may pass.
I shall only adde, that if our Divines
should prove their Doctrines no better
than by such wrested Scriptures and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
as this, we should hiss them out
of the Pulpit: but I suppose you have
some better Argument, therefore let me

                  <p>Consider then that irresistable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Christ is a Priest, after the order of

                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>Not at all; for his being Priest
evidently relates to that which follows,
<hi>and he blessed him, and received Tythes of

a Sacrifice, was Jesus Christ obliged
to offer the same kind of Sacrifice that he
did? for Christ was to offer up himself,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. (which none of his Types did.)
Tell me first, Was <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> a Type of

                  <p>Yes doubtless, and this was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
thing, in respect of which Christ is called

else I say nothing.</p>

                  <p>Then tell me, how can any man

spends so much of his Epistle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews;</hi>

who picks up the very smallest circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
as that he was <hi>without father,</hi> &amp;c.
Should not speak one word of this, which
(if you say true) was the principal thing?
Besides all this, If <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> was a type
of Christ in that action, Did Christ offer
Bread and Wine as <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> did?</p>

                  <p>Then first, I argue thus, The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of Christ was perfect, and did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
all Believers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it need not, and ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
for the Apostle proves the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
of Levitical Sacrifices, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were repeated, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1, 2.
<hi>Where remission of sin is, there is no more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
for sin,</hi> Heb. 10. 18. Either then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
was not obtained by his once offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or there must be no more offering;
either Christs offering upon the Cross
was insufficient, or yours in the Mass is
unnecessary.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>It is not properly repeated, for it is
the same Sacrifice, for substance, which was
offered upon the Cross, and is offered in the
Mass<note n="*" place="bottom">Cornelius à Lapide in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 28.</note>.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>How is it of the same kind, when
you say, the one is bloody, the other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloody;
the one offered by Christ, the
other by a Priest; but if it were of the
same kind, so were the Levitical Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
and all had relation to Christ
(as you pretend all Masses have) and
yet the Apostle makes their Repetition
an evidence of their Imperfection, <hi>Heb.</hi>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:109465:72"/>
9. 10. And moreover, the Apostle denies
not only the repetition of other Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but also of the same Sacrifice, and tells
us as plainly (as man can speak) that Christ
was to offer up himself but once, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.
25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas you wil needs over-rule
the Apostle, and force Christ to offer up
himself thousands of times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>It is true, there is but one Sacrifice
of Redemption, and Expiation for Sin, and
that was the Sacrifice of the Cross; but there
are other Sacrifices of Application to apply that
to us.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>I hope the Word, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Spirit of Christ, are sufficient
to apply Christs Sacrifice; must we have
one Sacrifice to apply another? who
ever heard of one plaister made to apply
another? or a ransome paid the second
time to apply the former payment? And
you seem to me quite to forget your
selves, to destroy the nature of your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:
for the business of a Sacrifice is
oblation to God, not application to men.
Besides, I have one Argument more
which fully satisfies me; if the Mass be a
real and proper Sacrifice, then the thing
sacrificed must be really and properly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed?</p>

                  <p>He is not so destroyed, for we tell
you, it is an unbloody Sacrifice; yet he is in a
manner destroy'd by the Priest's eating of
him: for thereby Christ ceaseth to be where
he was before, that is, in the species of Bread

                  <p>Call you this a destruction, for one

to cease to be where he was before? this
is ridiculous; and yet this<note n="b" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> fantastical
and mock-destruction is all which you can
bring, instead of that real destruction,
which you confess necessary to the very
essence of a Sacrifice. And as for the
Bread and Wine they were destroyed by
Transubstantiation, not by the Oblation
or Sacrifice which comes after it.</p>
                  <p>And now having mentioned that, let us
discourse concerning your Doctrine of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:109465:73"/>
Transubstantiation. And first, tell me what
is the Doctrine of your Church?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
you, which declareth,</hi> that by Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the whole substance of the Bread and

                  <p>How is it possible for the Bread
to be converted into Christs Body, which
was made already before the Bread? That
Christ could turn Water into Wine was
possible, but that he should turn that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into such Wine as was in being before
that change, this is impossible: but let
that go: My next question is, if a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
did actually receive Christs Body
and Blood, tell me, what profit hath he by
it? I cannot believe that God would work
so many Miracles (as you affirm he doth in
this Sacrament) to no purpose: Scripture
and Reason tells me, and your Council
of <hi>Trent</hi> confesseth<note n="b" place="bottom">Sess. 13. cap. 2.</note>, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is a feast for my Soul, and not for
my Body. Is it not so? Now, what is my
Soul the better for eating the very Body
of Christ? When the woman cryed out
to our Saviour,<note n="c" place="bottom">Luke 11. 27, 28.</note>

                  <p>I will do so, and our Church proves
this point, especially, from two places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<hi>John</hi> 6. and the words of Institution.
I begin with the sixth Chapter of <hi>John,</hi> where
our Saviour oft tells us, that <hi>the Bread

                  <p>I have heard, that divers of your

speaks not of the Sacrament: Is it so?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>I will not dissemble with you. That

                  <p>Certainly, This Argument is not
likely to convince a Protestant which
could not satisfie your own ablest Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.
But I will not press that farther.
Tell me then, do you judge that Christ
speaks here of a bodily eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his very Flesh and Blood?</p>

                  <p>I confess some of the Antient;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:109465:74"/>
were of your mind, I mean the Jews.
But with submission, I am rather of Christs
Opinion, who plainly destroys that gross
and carnal sense, telling them, it is the
<hi>Spirit that quickneth, the Flesh profits no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
vers. 63. Again, doth not Christ
press this as a necessary, and present duty,
upon all the Jews that then heard him?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>That must be granted.</p>

                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>Then certainly Christ speaks not
of the Sacrament which was not then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,
and therefore they could not
partake of it. I demand further, is this
Sacrament of such efficacy, that all that
receive it are saved; and of such necessity,
that all that do not take it are damned?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>No, our Church utterly condemns
both those Opinions.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Port:</speaker>
                  <p>But this eating of Christs Flesh
is such, that Christ saith, all that eat it are
saved, <hi>v.</hi> 24. and all that do not eat it are
damned, <hi>v.</hi> 53. Therefore surely he speaks
not of a Sacramental eating: besides the
whole Laity are utterly undone, if your
sense of this Chapter be true; for I find
that drinking of Christs Blood is no less
necessary to life eternal, than eating of
his Flesh; and therefore woe to them to
whom you do not allow to drink of the
Cup in the Sacrament. I am told this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:109465:74"/>
is so considerable, that it forced
divers of your Doctors (sore against their

therefore this will not do your work: but
I presume you have better Arguments.</p>

                  <p>We have so. I shall urge but one,

surely Christ would speak plainly to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding

after the manner of a Spirit, to conceive
of a body without bigness, long without
length, broad without breadth, broken
whilest it remains whole (all which you
profess to believe.) This is to turn Christs
plain speech into a bundle of Riddles; and
to call this the plain sense of the words
which is (as you see) a heap of Figures,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:109465:76"/>
is a greater figure than all the rest; but
they did well enough understand the
words in our sense, because they were well

                  <p>Besides, you cannot think strange,
if there be Figures in the first part, <hi>This

are Figures in the last part, <hi>This is the
New Testament in my bloud.</hi> Here are not
one, but divers Figures in it. The <hi>Cup</hi>
you grant is taken for the liquor in it,
there is one figure: The Wine in the
Cup is taken for the Bloud, which was
not in the Cup; there is a strange figure
indeed (Logicians call it <hi>Non-sense.</hi>) This
Cup, or Wine, or Bloud (if you please)
is the New Testament or Covenant;
whereas it was only the Seal of the New
Testament, as is most manifest, because it
is called, <hi>The Bloud of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the New Testament in my Bloud.</hi>
Besides other strange figures, which I
shall have occasion to speak to by and by.
Here is figure upon figure, and yet you
have the impudence to reproach us for
putting in but one figure, which you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess

Heavens, and judge O Earth, whether

confirm the truth in this point, than to
consider into what absurdities this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

<hi>the Bloud of Christ is properly the Covenant or

                  <p>Yes surely, or else we do ill to reproach

                  <p>The words are not true in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>First, for the word <hi>this,</hi> it is most
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:109465:78"/>
evident that it is meant of Bread: It is
impossible for words to express any thing
more plainly, than that by <hi>this,</hi> is meant
the Bread. It is said expresly, that <hi>Christ
took Bread and brake it, and gave it, and said,
Take eat,</hi> THIS <hi>is my Body.</hi> Where <hi>this</hi>
necessarily relates to that which Christ,
took, and brake, and gave. After Christ
came the Apostles, and particularly Saint
<hi>Paul,</hi> and he expounds the mind of Christ
(and I hope you do not think he was
so bad an Expositor, that his Comment
was harder than the Text) and he tells
us thrice in a breath that it is Bread,
1 Cor. 11. 26. <hi>As oft as you eat this Bread,</hi>
and <hi>whosoever shall eat this Bread,</hi> and <hi>so let
him eat of that Bread.</hi> And again, 1 Cor.
10. 16. <hi>The Bread which we break, is it
not the Communion of the Body of Christ?</hi>
And the participation of the Sacrament
is called, <hi>breaking of Bread,</hi> Acts 2. 46.
&amp; 20. 7. which your Authors undertand
of the Sacrament: and besides <hi>this,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it is, is broken, as it follows; but
you dare not say, Christs Body is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
Now then, since it is most evident,
that this is meant of the Bread, I hope,
you will not say, this is properly Christs
Body.</p>

                  <p>No: We are not so absurd to say, this
Bread is Christs body, for that is false and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>By <hi>This,</hi> I understand neither the
Bread nor Christs Body, but in general this
substance which is contained under this spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

                  <p>What do you mean by that? I
pray you tell me, Do you believe that
there are any more substances under those
species, besides the Bread first, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
the Body of Christ? Do not you
profess, that as soon as ever it ceaseth to be
Bread, it becomes the Body of Christ?</p>

                  <p>Then surely if it be a substance,
according to you, it must be either Bread,
or the Body of Christ; but you allow it
to be neither, and therefore it is no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
at all. In the next place, for the
word <hi>is,</hi> I have shewed, you do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand

                  <p>Then sure I am, the word <hi>Body</hi> is

                     <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Place de la messe.</note>How can you say that it is properly a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,

the great Argument for Christianity (as

work, if you may not credit the reports of

Argument is, that your Doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation

things absolutely impossible, and
gross contradictions.</p>

prove any real impossibilities which this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
forceth us to believe I must yield, for
we joyn with you in condemning the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran

because it is an impossibility, and we therefore
expound those words, <hi>I am the Vine, I am

Substance? I think the Mother is as good

to make Christs words
good, I know what work you would have

                  </p>
                  <p>But to give that over, I will shew you,
that there is such an heap of contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

I profess (when I set my wit at work) I

God himself cannot make a man to be

make the whole to be less than a part
of it: he cannot make three to be more
than threescore: he cannot make a Son
to beget his Father: he cannot make the

in like manner he cannot make the same
body to be in two several places; for this

                  <p>True, but this is your hard hap;
this Doctrine of yours is against Scripture
as well as Reason, and indeed against many
Articles of Religion.</p>
                  <p>And first, it is against the Scripture, in
as much as it is highly dishonourable to
Christ, whose honour is the great design
of the Scripture. What a foul dishonour
is it to him to subject him to the will of
every Mass Priest, who, when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
can command him down into the
Bread? What a dishonour is it, <hi>that the
very Body of Christ may be eaten by Rats or
Worms, and may be cast up by Vomit,</hi> and the
like, as your <hi>Aquinas</hi> affirms<note n="a" place="bottom">Sum. qu. 80. art. 3.</note>. And
that your Church in her <hi>Missals</hi> hath put
this amongst other directions, that if <hi>worms
or Rats have eaten Christ Body, they must be
burned; and if any man vomit it up, it must
be eaten again, or burned, or made a Relick;</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="bottom">Can. 39. Glossa in Can. c. 2. De Consecratione.</note>and yet this is no more than your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
will force you to own: for if you
will believe Christs words, in one place
as well as in another, he assureth us, that
<hi>whatsoever</hi> (without exception) <hi>entreth
into the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is
cast forth into the draught,</hi> Matth. 15. 17.</p>

                  <p>You mistake wofully; for though
in the dayes of his flesh, it was no dishonor
to him (and it was necessary for us) that
he suffered so many indignities, and died,
and was crucified, yet now, that he is risen
from the dead, <hi>he dies no more,</hi> Rom. 6. and
it is a dishonour to him to be crucified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and to be brought back to those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
which he long since left; and all
this to no purpose, and without any profit
to us, (as I shewed.) Again, the Scripture
approveth and useth this argument, that a
body cannot be in two places at once: it is
the Angels argument, <hi>He is not here, for he
is risen,</hi> Mat. 28. 6. sufficiently implying,
that he could not be here and there too:
or must we say, that the Angels argument
is weak or deceitful, that yours may be
strong and true?</p>

                  <p>It seems, if a man being sought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
should hide himself with you in some
corner or hole in your room, and the
pursuers should ask for him, you could
answer with good Conscience, <hi>He is not
here,</hi> because he is invisible. Our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Saviour every where makes these two
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:109465:83"/>
opposite, his being in the world, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to heaven, Joh. 13. 1. <hi>The hour was
come that he should depart out of this world
unto the Father:</hi> It seems you could have
taught him the art of going thither, and
keeping here too. I promise you, I durst
not venture to buy an Estate of any of you,
for it seems you could tell how to sell it
to me, and keep it to your selves. You
may remember, once you and I made our
selves merry with a passage that one used
in a speech; that since he could not give
content, neither by <hi>going</hi> nor <hi>staying,</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
he would neither <hi>go</hi> nor <hi>stay.</hi> It
seems you have as good a faculty as he
had; for you know how a man may both
<hi>go from a place,</hi> and <hi>stay in it,</hi> at the same
time. I know not what can be more plain
if you did not shut your eyes: Christ
saith expresly, <hi>me you have not alwayes,</hi> that
is, <hi>here, Mat.</hi> 26. 11. Besides, your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
destroyes the truth of Christs Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature. I read of Christ, that <hi>he
was in all points like unto us, sin only excepted;</hi>
his Body was like ours, and therefore it is
impossible it should be in a thousand se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
places at once (as you pretend it is;)
this turns Christs Body into a Spirit: nay,
indeed you make his body more spiritual
than a Spirit; for a Spirit cannot be in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:109465:84"/>
places divided from it self. The
soul of man, if it be entire both in the
whole and in every part of the body,
yet it is not divided from it self, nor from
its body, nor can it be in two several bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
at the same time, as all confess; and
much less can it be in ten thousand bodies
at once (as by your Argument undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
it may). When ever an Angel comes
to earth, he leaves heaven: and so this
every way destroyes the truth of Christs
Humane body.</p>

                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>Much of what you say was true of
Christs Body in the dayes of his infirmity;
but when he was risen from the dead, then he
received a Spiritual Body, as it is said, ours
shall be at the resurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>To this I answer, First, that you
ascribe these monstrous properties to
Christs Body before its Resurrection;
for you say, The Flesh and Bloud of
Christ were really in the Sacrament,
which the Disciples received while Christ
lived. Secondly, Christs Resurrection,
though it heightned the perfections, yet
it did not alter the Nature and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of his Body, nor give it the being of
a Spirit; for after he was risen, he proves
that he was no Spirit, by this Argument,
<hi>Handle me and see, for a Spirit hath not flesh
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:109465:84"/>
and bones, as you see me have,</hi> Luke 24. 39.
By this it appears, that your Doctrine
destroys the Truth of Christs Humanity,
at least it destroys the main evidence of
it (against those who affirmed, that Christ
had only a phantastical Body) namely,
that he was seen, and felt, and heard; for
you say, sense is not to be believed. Again,
you destroy the truth of Christs ascension
into Heaven. For Christ is not ascended
if he hath not left the world; for these
two are joyned together, <hi>Ioh. 16. 28. I
leave the world, and go to the Father:</hi> but if
you say true, he hath not left the world,
but is here in every Sacrament; nothing
can be more plain, than that Christ did vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
and locally leave this world when he
went up into heaven, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 9, 10. that
being once there, <hi>the heavens must receive</hi>
(or <hi>contain) him, until the time of the resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of all things,</hi> Acts 3. 21. and that at
the last day he shall come visibly and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
from heaven, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 7. but that
he should come down a thousand times in
a day, at the command of every Mass-Priest,
is such a dream, as the Scripture
speaks not one syllable of, nor can any
rational man believe it: Moreover, your
Doctrine destroys the very Essence of a
Sacrament, which consists of two parts, an
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:109465:85"/>
outward element or sign, and the inward
grace signified by it; and this I am told
your Doctors acknowledge<note n="a" place="bottom">Bell. de Sacramentis in genere, lib. 1. c. 9. &amp;c. 11.</note> I shall
forbear mentioning further particulars,
these are more than enough to shew the
falseness of this Doctrine of Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, pray let me hear
what you have to say for your great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of praying to Saints.</p>
                  <p>But, first, I am told divers of your

to pray to Saints, but only convenient: Is
it so?</p>

I will rather urge other Considerations.</p>
                  <p>1. Humility and Discretion adviseth us
to this duty, for I suppose, if you have any
request to the King, you do not sawcily rush
into his presence, but make use of some of his
Courtiers.</p>

his Subjects to <hi>call upon him in the day of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:109465:86"/>
trouble, to come to him freely,</hi> and upon
all occasions, <hi>to pour out their complaints to
him, not doubting but he will receive and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
them,</hi> and this King were always at
perfect leisure to hear their requests, and
the oftner they come to him, the welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
they are; and he appoints his own Son
the Master of the Requests, from time to
time, to receive all the Petitions of his
Subjects; and both the King and the
Prince are ten thousand times more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate
than the Courtiers; would you
not in this case account him a fool (and
somewhat else too) that should spend his
time in petitioning this and the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Courtier to gain access to the
King?</p>

                  <p>Then your Church hath need to
make use of that counsel, James 1. 5: <hi>If
any man want wisdom, let him ask it of God;</hi>
they rather choose to ask it of Saints, and
that is the reason they go without it. Most
plain it is, this is the very case, and such
a King God in all points is, and infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
better than all this, and such a Master
of Requests Christ is: but for the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
you talk of, I think therein you do
prudently; for I remember the worship

that shall argue so absurdly: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
it seems very unlikely to me, that the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:109465:90"/>
Cherubims were ordained to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the people, because they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
seen by the people. You put the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
which you worship in the most visible

                  <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                  <p>Yet no man could worship the Ark but
he must worship the Cherubims, for they were
over the Ark.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>In that case the Cherubims were
not at all worshipped, unless you will
say, that he that worships one of your
wooden Images, worships also the Spider,
(which peradventure is paying its devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
there, and got into the Saints mouth.)
Besides, it doth not appear that the Ark
it self was worshipped, for that also was
not so much as seen by the people, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not like to be worshipped. All that
we read is, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> did and
ought to worship God toward the Ark;
and so they are said to worship God <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the whole Temple, and toward Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
and towards the Holy Mountain, and
towards Heaven.</hi> Yet I presume you will
not say all these places were to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiped,
and if God was to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
towards these places; because he
tells us expresly, his special presence was
there. What is this to Images? which God
banisheth from his House and presence:
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:109465:90"/>
and to conclude this, I pray you tell me,
Is it lawful to worship every place where
God is in a special manner present?</p>

                  <p>In that case certainly the King is

                  <p>You say right. And so God will

Commands, upon pretence of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
If a King require such reverence
to be given to his Presence-Chamber, it
is fit that he should be obeyed (seeing it is
only a civil, and not a religious respect:)
and if God forbid any such reverence,
any Religious worship should be given
to any graven Images, good reason his
prohibition too should be obeyed. You
talk of honouring God, but for the way
or means of honouring God, whether it
be most reasonable to take an estimate
from the Rules and Practices of all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Idolaters (who have all justified their
Idolatry from this pretence of honouring
God) or from the Commands of Gods,
Word, and the practices of the godly Jews

                  <p>Well, but this I am sure is true, we

they could not be so brutish, as to think
that Golden Calf, which <hi>they brought</hi> out

                  <p>You use also to call an Image by

The Heathens also excused their Idolatry

<hi>We do not worship the Images of Gold or Brass,</hi>

                  <p>They worshiped wicked Men; but we

                  <p>Then Saint <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 10. and
the Angel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. and Saint <hi>Paul, Acts</hi>
14. might have received that adoration
(as being the friends of God) which they
so utterly rejected. <hi>Moses</hi> was the friend
of God, yet God hid away his body, lest
the Israelites should worship him. And
I have heard that the Fathers charged the

of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="bottom">Epiphanius Haeresi. 97. per totum.</note> and the <hi>Arrians</hi>
for worshipping Christ, whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to be but a creature (though all
agreed they were the friends of God.) I
suppose if any man should attempt to
give the honour, proper to the King, to his
Brother, or Friend, this would not excuse
them from Treason; nor will it excuse
any Adulteress that she lay with her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
dearest Friend or Relation. Again,
it matters not much to this point, for what
reason you worship Images: the only que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is, whether you do worship Images?
for the very doing of that (whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

pretences it may have) is Idolatry.
Besides, if you worshipped God alone,
and not the Image, your excuse would
have some colour; but it is most evident,
that you worship not only God, but the
Image too. I am told that your own <hi>Azo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>

in them.</hi>

                  <p>Then I see the vanity of your
pretences, and that you only seek to raise
a mist before the eyes of ignorant people;
for in truth you worship the Image it self,
though happily not for its self: as if a
Heathen Emperor commanded his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
Religiously to Worship such a Vice-gerent
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:109465:93"/>
of his; no man, who did worship
that Vice-gerent, could deny that he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
him, though he did it only for the
Emperours sake. Tell me, I pray you, do
you not hold, that there are two kinds of
Religious Worship; namely, absolute,
(which you give to God or the Saints)
and relative, (which you give to their
Images)?</p>

                  <p>Then it is horrible impudence to
say, you do not give worship to the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
since you give one of these two kinds
unto them, and unto them only: besides,
if all you say were true, this would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
you from Idolatry; for your Church
professeth and commandeth the Worship
of the Images of Saints, as well as of God
and Christ; and since it is Idolatry to
give Divine Honour to any creature (as I
before proved) you are no less guilty in
giving it to the Saints themselves, than to
their Images, and so you are double-dy'd
Idolaters.</p>

                     <speaker>Pop.</speaker>

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:109465:94"/>
that you did not your work so grosly, that

                     <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                     <p>Then my first answer is, That this
Command was peculiar to the Iews, who were
most prone to Idolatry<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Vasquez</hi> de adoratione.</note>.</p>

                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>This is not true. It sufficiently
appears that the Gentiles were under the
obligation of this Law, from those pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
which God inflicted upon them
for their transgression or breach of it by
Idolatry, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. But <hi>where there is no
Law, there is no transgression.</hi> Besides,
Christ tell, us, <hi>He came not to destroy the
Law,</hi> (the Moral Law) <hi>but to fulfil it,</hi>
Mat. 5. 17. Belike, you are not of his
mind; and dare you say the Jews, as soon
they believed in Christ, were dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from this command, and allowed to
worship the Images which that command
forbad?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                     <p>I will not say so; but I have a
second Answer; The thing prohibited here is
not <hi>Images,</hi> (which are representations of
real things) as you falsly render it, but
<hi>Idols,</hi> which are the Images of false gods,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:109465:95"/>
which are not, and never were in the world.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>The Text its self is full against
you; for the Images there prohibited,
are not said to be the Images of the false
gods of the Heathens (whereof many ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had any being) but the Images <hi>of any
thing in heaven or earth,</hi> &amp;c. Moreover,
divers of the Heathen gods were men
whom they deified. I hope their Pictures
were Pictures of real things, yet these are
Idols.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                     <p>Though they really were Men, yet
their pictures were made to represent them as
gods, and such they were not really, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were Idols.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>The learned Heathens knew (as
well as you and I do) that <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and
<hi>Mars,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> and the rest, were
meer Men, (and they smiled at the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of their Vulgar, that thought other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise)
only they thought of them just as
you do of the Saints, that the great God
had put some of his honour upon them,
and therefore they might worship them;
you cannot be so silly to think, the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Heathens thought <hi>Augustus</hi> was a god
really, when he was dead; yet their
worship of his Image was Idolatry. And
they that worshipped the Image of <hi>Caligu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>
(while he lived) were not so sottish
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:109465:95"/>
to take him for a god (whom they knew
to be a foolish and wicked man) yet I
hope you will not excuse them from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.
But further, as the Jews did uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
understand this to be a prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all manner of Images; so all the
Prophets, and Christ, and the Apostles
were so far from reproving them (which
they would have done, if it had been an
Error) that they every where strengthen
them in this opinion, by declaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all worship of Images, without any
distinction. And tell me, I pray you, if
any Jew had at that time made (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance)
an Image of the Sun not looking
on it as God, but as a glorious creature of
God, and therefore fit to be religiously
worshipped (as you think of the Saints
and Angels) and had bowed down to it and
worshipped it: Do you think he had not
broken this Law?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                     <p>I dare not deny but he had broken
it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>Yet this had been no <hi>Idol,</hi> but
an <hi>Image,</hi> according to your sense of it.
Besides, I find that all manner of Images
are forbidden, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 1. howsoever, to me
you seem to venture your salvation upon
a nice point, for the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Image</hi> nor <hi>Idol,</hi> but <hi>Pesel,</hi> as a <hi>Divine</hi>
                        <pb n="170" facs="tcp:109465:96"/>
told me; and this, I understand is diversly
translated; some render it an <hi>Image,</hi> others
an <hi>Idol.</hi> Now you ventrue your soul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, that the last is the only true Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation,
which is a dreadful hazard; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is otherwise rendred, not only
by Protestants, but by the most and best
ancient interpreters<note n="*" place="bottom">Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion, Sic Iosephus <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>I cannot deny it, for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
themselves would confute me; But
one thing I have to say, you must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
one Scripture so as to agree with
another: Now I find God himself allows and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:109465:96"/>
prescribes some Images, as those of the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims;
either then he contradicts himself,
or he doth not forbid all Images, but Idols
only.</p>

                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>Though I might say, God may
make an exception to some of his Laws,
when no man can (as in the case of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi>
offering up <hi>Isaac,</hi> and the <hi>Israelites,</hi>
spoiling the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> of their Jewels)
yet I need no other answer but this; I
directly deny that here is any contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
at all: For our question is not about
the making of Images (whether by Gods
order or Mans) but about the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of them. And albeit there were such
Images made, yet they were not made to
be worshipped, as I before proved; nor
was there any danger the people should
worship them, because they were not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to see them. But I pray you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
me this one question, I am told that
divers of your own Authors confess, that
the Jews indeed were; though Christians
are not forbidden the use of Images by
this command. Is it so?</p>

                     <p>If this Text proves the pardon
of any sins, it proves the pardon of that
sin no less than others, because the sin
against the Holy Ghost is here spoken of
as the only sin which is unpardonable in
both worlds: Besides, Christ speaks thus
in opposition to a corrupt opinion, which,
I have heard, now is, and then was rife
among the Jews, to wit, that divers of
their sins were pardoned after this life,
and that this was one of their antient
Prayers, <hi>Let my death be the expiation of
all my sins:</hi> for they thought the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of this life and death, the last of
them, did free them from the punishments
of the other life: And I have heard that
it was one of their sayings, That <hi>every Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite
hath a part in the future life:</hi> Are
these things so?</p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>
                        <hi>To deal freely with you. This is not
only true, but it is one of our Arguments for
Purgatory, that</hi> Jason <hi>the</hi> Cyrenian (<hi>who
lived long before Christs time) expresly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
that</hi> it is profitable to pray for the
dead, that their sins may be pardoned,
2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 12.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>I think that is impertinently al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
for Purgatory: for the sin those
men died in, was a mortal sin, (as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess)
and therefore not pardonable in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.
But I thank you for this; for now
I am satisfied that it was an antient opinion
among the <hi>Iews,</hi> and so Christ had just
occasion to use this expression, to confute
that vain expectation of theirs. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the meaning of this phrase, <hi>Shall not
be forgiven,</hi> is, that <hi>it shall be punished in both
Worlds:</hi> this is a frequent phrase in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
Thus <hi>Exod. 20. 7. God will not hold
him guiltless,</hi> that is, he will severely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish:
<hi>To accept persons in judgment is not
good,</hi> that is, <hi>is very bad; The father of a fool
rejoyceth not,</hi> that is, <hi>grieveth much.</hi> I hear
S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> expounds it thus<note n="*" place="bottom">In locum.</note>, and a
greater than he, S. <hi>Mark 3. 29. He hath
never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal
damnation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="178" facs="tcp:109465:100"/>
Besides all this, we all agree that there
is a kind of forgiveness of sin after this
life, and at the Day of Judgment, Acts
3. 19. <hi>Repent, that your sins may be blotted
out, when the times of refreshing shall come
from the presence of the Lord;</hi> for then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the pardon of sin is compleated and
fully manifested. And it is a common
phrase in Scripture to speak of a thing as
done, when it is only declared and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested,
as the Apostle saith, those words,
Psal. 2. <hi>This day have I begotten thee,</hi> were
fulfilled in Christs Resurrection, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.
because that declared him to be the only
begotten Son o God, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
                     <p>To which I might add, that by <hi>the
World to come,</hi> Christ may very probably
understand the time of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which begun at Christs death. The
<hi>Iews</hi> (I hear) oft use this expression of the
days of the Messias. Nay, the Apostle
himself doth so, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 5. This also I
have read, that the <hi>Iews</hi> did generally
expect a more plentiful and glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sins at that time, and so Christs
meaning may be this, That <hi>this blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
shall not be forgiven,</hi> neither in that time
nor state of the Church, (in which Christ
then was) nor in the time of the Gospel
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:109465:100"/>
and Kingdom of the Messias which began
at his death (as I said) when, though there
should be many great sins and sinners par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
(as we see there were) yet this
should not. I hope you will not brag much
of your Argument from this place, let me
hear your other place.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>My second Argument is from,</hi> 1 Cor.

                     <p>It seems you understand this fire
properly, which is something strange
when the whole place is metaphorical, or
figurative; <hi>The Gold and Silver, Hay and
Stubble,</hi> all are metaphorical, and so doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
is <hi>the fire.</hi> I hear your <hi>Bellarmin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth,
that <hi>the fire</hi> mentioned, <hi>v. 13. The
fire shall try every mans work,</hi> is not meant
of Purgatory.</p>

                     <p>That is enough to overthrow this
Argument, for it is most evident that the
fire, <hi>vers.</hi> 13. and 15. is one and the same.

                     <p>I shall urge only two.</p>
                     <p>First, Christ hath fully paid our debt,
and satisfied Gods Justice for all our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:109465:101"/>
and therefore it were injustice in
God to require the payment of any part
of that debt in Purgatory. Christ is a
compleat Saviour, <hi>His blood cleanseth us
from all sin,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 7. <hi>He is able</hi> (and sure
he is no less willing) <hi>to save to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
those that come to him, Heb.</hi> 7. 25. God
<hi>laid all our sins upon him, Isa.</hi> 53. and he
<hi>bare them all in his body, 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 24. In short,
either you make Christ but an half Saviour
and believers wash away part of their own
guilt; or if Christ hath fully washed away
their guilt, you make god both unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,
and unjust, and untrue too; so dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to punish innocent persons, and those
too his own children (as you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)
whom he declares he hath freely
and fully pardoned; and to do this for sins,
which you confess venial, and such as do
not deserve the loss of Gods favour, and
that without any necessity, This is not the
act of a Father, especially so tender a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as God is.</p>

                     <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                     <p>Christ is a sufficient Saviour, and
hath fully satisfied, but his satisfaction is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to us by the pains of Purgatory.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>If Purgatory only apply Christs
satisfaction to us, then he satisfied for our
<hi>temporal</hi> as well as our eternal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and if he did so, surely he did
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:109465:102"/>
it fully, or not at all. Besides, you need
not trouble your heads about the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
God hath provided for us more
comfortable means of application, on his
part, <hi>the Word, Sacraments, and Spirit;</hi> on
our parts, <hi>Faith.</hi> You may keep Purgatory
for your own use, it is not fit you should
be pestered with any Hereticks there. But
was ever such an application of Gods
Grace heard of since the World began;
that God should apply his Mercy, and the
Grace of Christ Jesus, by such exquisite
torments? This is (as one truly saith) <hi>as
if a man should apply Physick by poison, or
apply the light of the Sun, by putting out our
eyes.</hi> God deliver us from such appliers.
This is as if a Prince should pretend a free
pardon to a Malefactor, and apply it by
putting him upon the Rack.</p>

Sin. Scripture fully condemns this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
It tells me that <hi>the wages of sin</hi> (all
sin, without any difference) <hi>is death,</hi> even
that death which is opposite to eternal
life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. that <hi>He that shall break the
least of Gods commands, and teach men so,</hi>
(though peradventure he do it ignorantly
and so according to your opinion, it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
sin) <hi>shall be called the least in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven;</hi> that is, he shall have no
portion there. It tells me, <hi>Cursed is every
one that continueth not in all things written in
the Book of the Law to do them, Gal.</hi> 3. 10.
And he speaks of that curse which Christ
underwent for us, and redeemed us from.
It tells me, that <hi>for every idle word that men
shall speak, they shall give an account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in the Day of Iudgment,</hi> (and <hi>by such
words,</hi> if not repented of, <hi>they shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned)
Mat.</hi> 12. 36, 37. So now your
foundation, and one of the Pillars of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
is gone. And as for your other
fansie, that Christ did not satisfie for our
temporal punishments, I pray you tell me,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:109465:103"/>
did not Christ suffer temporal afflictions?</p>

                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>Surely all that Christ suffered, he
suffered for us, both in our stead, and for
our good. He was cut off, <hi>not for himself,</hi>
(but for our sins) <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 25. It was for
our sakes that he bare that temporal part
of the curse, to <hi>be hanged on a Tree;</hi> and
all that pain and shame was but a temporal
punishment, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. I read, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.
that <hi>Christ bore our griefs, and carried our
sorrows, v.</hi> 4. which was not only accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
in this, that he bare the guilt of our
sins, as <hi>S. Peter</hi> expounds it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24.
but also in this, that he delivered them
from sicknesses and temporal afflictions,
as St. <hi>Matthew</hi> expounds it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 16, 17.
and both these consist well together, since
Christ removed both sin the cause, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
the effect of it.</p>

                     <p>If Christ had satisfied for our tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
punishments, then Believers should be free
from all pains, and loss, and death, which it
is apparent they are not; and therefore not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the fulness of Christs satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they may be liable to pains in Purgatory as
well as in this life.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>To this I answer three things.
First, Your inference from the pains of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:109465:103"/>
this life to the torments of Purgatory is
weak, and false. I may, and must believe,
that God afflicts his people here, because
Scripture and Experience put it out of
doubt. But that Cod will punish his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in Purgatory after this life, no Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
affirms. You that can multiply your
instances of the sufferings of Believers
in this life, and can tell us of <hi>Adam,</hi> and
<hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and many others,
have not to this day been able (though of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
urged) to produce one instance of the
sufferings of any one Believer, after this
life (which one consideration is sufficient
to overthrow this Argument in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of any indifferent man.)</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There is not the same reason
for the sufferings of believers here, and
those which you suppose in Purgatory, nor
are they of the same nature. The present
sufferings of Believers are necessary,
(1 <hi>Pet. 1. 6. You are in heaviness if need be</hi>)
both for Believers themselves to subdue
the Flesh, which in this life is potent, and
altogether needs such a curb. <hi>By this shall
the iniquity of Iacob be purged,</hi> Isa. 27. 9.
and to prevent their eternal damnation,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 32. as also for the terror and
caution of other offenders. So that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
Christ hath fully paid the debt, yet it
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:109465:104"/>
is upon other accounts convenient that
they should smart and suffer here. But
there is no such necessity nor use of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
sufferings, neither for Believers
themselves (since there is no mortification
of corruption after this life, no tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to sin there, no improvement of
grace, no fear of eternal damnation)<note n="a" place="bottom">In Purgatorio animae nec mereri nec peccare pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunt, <hi>Bel. de Purg. l. 2. cap.</hi> 2. Animae in Purgatorio certae sunt de suâ salute, <hi>ibid. cap.</hi> 4.</note>
nor for example and warning to others;
For their fellow-sufferers in Purgatory,
you do not pretend they are at all edified
by their sufferings; and men here, they
neither see nor know any thing of these
pains, nor hath God revealed any thing
concerning them; but when God makes
any examples to others, he sets them in
the view of others, or at least acquaints
them fully therewith, as he did with Hell
torments to this end. It were a sensles<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
thing to hang up a man in <hi>Iamaica,</hi> for
the terror of those that live in <hi>England.</hi>
Besides, the sufferings of Believers here
do come from the love, and faithfulness
of God, <hi>Heb. 12. 6. Whom the Lord lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
he chasteneth, Psal. 119. 75. In faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
thou hast afflicted me.</hi> Accordingly,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:109465:104"/>
good men have looked upon them as
choice mercies, <hi>Psal. 97. 12. Blessed is the
man whom thou chastnest,</hi> and <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 67.
<hi>It was good for me that I was afflicted:</hi> and
the denial of afflictions is threatned as a
grievous punishment, <hi>Is. 1. 5. Hos.</hi> 4. 14. 17.</p>
                     <p>But now the sufferings of Purgatory
are in all points contrary; they are pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vindictive, and the effects of meer
wrath: nor do you esteem those sufferings
a mercy, and your happiness, but freedom
from them. And therefore your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
from the pains of this life to those
in Purgatory, is foolish and absurd.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Believers suffering here do
not at all derogate from the fulness of our
Redemption by Christ, because (as I have
shewed) admitting that to be compleat,
yet they are necessary for other purposes.
But your Purgatory sufferings do, by
communicating at least some part of his
proper work to your selves. You pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
they wash away part of your sins,
which is Christs peculiar honor, <hi>He washed
us from our sins in his own blood, Rev.</hi> 1. 5.
You make them a part of the curse of the
Law <hi>from which</hi> (and not only from a part
of it) <hi>Christ hath redeemed us, himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made a curse for us, Gal.</hi> 3. 13. You
make them a real satisfaction in part to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:109465:105"/>
Gods justice (which is not satisfied by all
that Christ did or suffered without them.)
And, in a word, you make men in part
their own Redeemers and Saviours I hope
by this you see how weakly you reason
from present troubles, to Purgatory tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and that notwithstanding your
objection, my first Argument stands good
ag<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>inst Purgatory.</p>
                     <p>My second Argument is this, that the
Scripture every where speaks of the state
of Believers immediately after death, as
happy and blessed; and that all the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of Believers are confined to this
life; and of this we have many expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and examples too in Scripture, and
not one to the contrary. <hi>The sufferings of
this present time</hi> (saith S. <hi>Paul) are not
worthy to be compared with the glory,</hi> Rom. 8.
18. He knew no other sufferings: the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
of Believers are <hi>light, and but for
a moment,</hi> and they too are in <hi>things that are
seen, 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 17, 18. and therefore he knew
of no sufferings in the invisible world,
unless happily you will say that S. <hi>Paul's</hi>
Travels were in another road into the
third heavens, and so he was ignorant of
Purgatory. <hi>Lazarus received his evil things
in this life,</hi> Luk. 16. 25. <hi>But now he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,</hi>
therefore surely not in Purgatory.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:109465:105"/>
                        <hi>If our earthly house of this Tabernacle be
dissolved, we have an house in Heaven,</hi> saith
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 1. <hi>We are no longer absent
from the Lord, than present in the Body,</hi> saith
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 5, 6, 7, 8. The Prophet as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
us, that when righteous men die,
<hi>they enter into peace, they rest in their beds,</hi>
Isa. 57. 1, 2. I tell you, their beds are
very hard, and the Prophets mistake was
very great, if they be frying in the flames
of Purgatory. The <hi>Beggar died</hi> (and it
follows immediately) <hi>he was carried by
Angels into Abrahams bosom.</hi> I cannot think
these Angels mistook their way: the Theif
was to be with <hi>Christ that day in Paradise,</hi>
Luke 23. 43.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                     <p>The Thief was a kind of Martyr,
and so had that priviledge.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>His death was so far from being a
Martyrdom, that it was a just punishment
for his evil deeds, as he confesseth, <hi>v.</hi> 41.
But because some of your Martyrs (as you
call them) were indeed Malefactors;
therefore to salve their honour; you make
this Malefactor a Martyr. I will give you
but one place more of many, and that is
<hi>Rev. 14. 13. Blessed are the dead that die in
the Lord, from henceforth, that they may
rest from their labours.</hi> A place so clear,
that I am told, a famous Doctor of your
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:109465:106"/>
own, and one of the <hi>Sorbon</hi>-Colledge,
<hi>Picherellus</hi> by name, did ingenuously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> had in these few words put
out the fire of Purgatory.<note n="a" place="bottom">De Missâ p. 156.</note> And I am
perswaded you would have been ashamed
to have kindled it again, but that by this
craft you get all your living.</p>
                     <p>I think I need say no more to this point,
let us now go to another. We have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
of Purgatory: Now if you please,
let us discourse of the ways whereby you
pretend to free men from it, which is by

                     <p>It is well you mention that, for I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
you it is a matter of salvation and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
our Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that it is <hi>by divine right necessary,</hi> and
as attrition alone (which is a grief for sin,
arising only from a fear of hell) will save a
man where confession to a Priest follows; so all
the repentance in the world will never save
him, <hi>without this Confession</hi> to a Priest, <hi>viz.
actual</hi> where it may be had, or <hi>in desire</hi> when
it cannot be actually had.</p>

                        <hi>I will give you that in the words of
the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>as near as I can: they
say, That</hi> every Christian is bound under
pain of damnation, to confess to a Priest
all his mortal sins, which after diligent
examination he can possibly remember;
yea, even his most secret sins, his very
thoughts; yea, and all the Circumstances
of them which are of any moment<note n="a" place="bottom">

                     <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                     <p>You shall: Our two great Arguments
are these; First, Priests are by God made
Iudges, and intrusted with power of the
Keys for the Remission of Sins: but no Iudges
can exercise judicature, unless they know and
understand the cause; and the Priest must
know all the particular sins, and their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
by the mans own confession, or else
he knows not whether to bind or loose him, to
forgive or to condemn him: This is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
upon which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>
builds their Decree<note n="b" place="bottom">

                     <p>Tell me I pray you; Is it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to Salvation, to confess every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:109465:107"/>
mortal sin? What if a man unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
forget some of them?</p>

                     <p>In that case we confess they may be
pardoned without it, and it may suffice to say

                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>Now your Argument is quite lost:
For it seems in this case (which may be in
many hundreds of sins, especially in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of bad memory) your Judge can pass
sentence without knowing the particular
Cause, and therefore such knowledge is
not necessary to his giving Absolution.
Moreover, tell me, I pray you, may not a
Priest absolve him from his sins, whom
Christ hath absolved?</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>And is not every Priest bound to
believe, that Christ hath absolved every
person that is truly penitent?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                     <p>There is no question of that.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>Suppose a sinner hath visibly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
all his wicked wayes and company,
and lives a very holy life before he comes
to the Priest, and the Priest is certainly
informed of this: Is not the Priest bound
in that case to believe he is truly peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:109465:107"/>
                     <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                     <p>I should be most uncharitable if I

                     </speaker>
                     <p>Then he may without any more
ado upon his desire absolve him, because
it appears that Christ hath absolved him,
It is not at all necessary to a Priest to this
purpose to know whether a man be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or a less sinner, since the grace of God
is offered unto great as well as little sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
and therefore seeing this is your
strong argument, and that learned Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
could find no better, I see your cause
is very low and bad; but I suppose you
have some other Argument for it.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>Is this your strong argument?
here is not a word of the Priest, nor of
Confession to him, but only to our fellow
Christians; this confession is mutual, and
it will as well prove that the Priest is
bound to confess his sins to the People,
as that the People are bound to confess
to the Priest: the very next words are,
<hi>Pray one for another;</hi> what are we bound to
pray only for the Priest? It is one thing
that sets me against your Religion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what pitiful arguments you rely

weakness of your arguments for it, might
save me the labour of mine against it;
therefore I shall only offer to your
thoughts these two considerations.</p>
                     <p>1. Your doctrine makes that necessary
to salvation which God hath not made
necessary. There is no command of God
or Christ for it, as your eminent Doctors
acknowledge,<note n="ast;" place="bottom">

from the vanity of your proofs for it;
you confess it was not necessary in the old
Testament, and yet there was as much need
and use of it then as now, and Christ hath
made the condition of his Church not
more, but less burthensome than it was
before. Many commands and exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to repentance there are in Scripture,
not one which either commands this auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
confession to a Priest, or declares the
necessity of it, produce one place and I
yield; there are many instances of <hi>Iohn</hi>
the Baptist, and Christ and the Apostles,
either actual giving, or in Gods Name
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:109465:108"/>
proposing and offering remission of sins
upon the conditions prescribed in the
Gospel<note n="a" place="bottom">Luk: 18. 13. Mat. 9. 2. Act. 2. 38. &amp; 3. 19, &amp; 22. 16.</note> among which not one of them
requires this auricular confession: Bring
one instance to the point and I yield.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>I will give you two instances,</hi> Matt.
3. 6. The Pharisees were baptized—
confessing their sins: and, the conjurers
confessed their sins, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 18.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>These places do both speak of
publick confession and in case of scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
sins (which we acknowledge to be a
duty) but what is this to auricular confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?
will you never speak to the purpose?
besides these places cannot be meant of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular
confession for that was not then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,
as your council of <hi>Trent</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.
Well, I see you can bring neither
instance of this confession nor precept for
it, and therefore I am sure there is no sin
in the neglect of it, for <hi>where there is no
law, there is no transgression,</hi> Rom. 4. 15.</p>
                     <p>2. Your doctrine makes that insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for pardon and salvation which God
makes sufficient. The great God assureth
us. <hi>That he that confesseth and forsaketh his
sins shall find mercy,</hi> Prov. 28. 13.</p>

first. That there are divers Saints who have
not only merit for themselves, but a great
deal to spare, and all their merits are put
into one treasury. Secondly, That these
merits are appliable to others, so as God
will pardon <hi>Thomas,</hi> for example, for <hi>Iohns</hi>
merit. Thirdly, That God hath put this
treasure into the Churches, that is, the
Popes hands, and from him into the hands
of all Priests, who have a power to apply
these merits as they see fit.</p>

that there is no Purgatory, there
is your foundation of indulgences gone;
next I hope ere we part to shew, that
there is no such thing as merit in good
works, which is another of your founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Next, that <hi>any mans merits</hi> (except
Christs) may be applied to another, I
pray you inform me, for I have learned
quite otherwise: I read that <hi>every one

                        <hi>Hence it appears that</hi> Ministers <hi>are
made judges, and intrusted with full power and
authority of binding and loosing; so as</hi> Christ
doth not loose (<hi>or forgive</hi>) a sinner by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but only by the Priest, <hi>as</hi> Bellarmin
<hi>saith.</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="bottom">Ia 3. partem Thomae qu. 84. art. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>And to speak properly, as our most
learned</hi> Vasquez <hi>affirmeth,</hi> God doth not
properly loose a sinner, but only approves
of the Priests loosing of him (<note n="b" place="bottom">Ia 3. partem Thomae qu. 84. art. 3.</note>).</p>

                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>Now in my opinion, it were good
manners to make the Priest come after
God, and not to make God depend upon
the Priest. It seems then, if the Priest,
should grow surly or envious, and deny
me a Pardon, Christ cannot help me, for
he hath given the power out of his hands:
So you make the Priest the Judge, and
God only the Approver. The Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
this spirit of Blasphemy. Again,
nothing is more familiar in Scripture than
for Gods Ministers to be said to do that,
which they do only authoritatively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that God will do. Thus God saith
to <hi>Ieremy, I have set thee over Kingdoms to
root out, and pull down, and destroy,</hi> that is,
by declaring that God would do it: In like
manner Gods Ministers are said to bind
and loose, because they have from God
authority, to declare a Sinner to be bound
by his Sins, or loosed from them, which
(if they declare truly and according to
Gods word) God in heaven doth and will
make it good. As for this Text, it saith
nothing but this, that every one whom
they bind or loose, that is, proceeding
according to their rule, (which is always
to be understood) shall be bound or
loosed in heaven; but it doth not say that
no man is bound or loosed, but they whom
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:109465:112"/>
the Priest bindeth and looseth.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <p>But besides, if all these things were
granted, how doth this Text prove that
the Priest or Pope can absolve or release
any souls out of Purgatory, if there were
such a place? I pray you tell me, can the
Pope binde any soul and keep him in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory?</p>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                     <p>No, we do not pretend to that.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>Then he cannot loose a soul nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of Purgatory; for I am sure
binding and loosing are of the same extent.
But upon second thoughts, I must own
your discretion; for the binding of souls
in Purgatory was an invidious and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
work, and would have bound up
mens hearts and purses: It is only the
loosing of them out which opens their
purse strings, &amp; tends to the edification of
the Church, that is, the Pope and Priests (as
they always understand that word.) In
sober sadness, it is enough to make any
serious Christian abhor your Church, that
your Pope should not be content to usurp
a power over the whole visible world, but
that he should extend his Authority to the
other world, even to Purgatory. In my
opinion he had done more wisely to have
extended his empire to Hell, for there
are many of his Predecessours (so far as
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:109465:112"/>
can be judged by any mans life) whom he
might have appointed his Deputies: but
there is never a Pope in Purgatory; for
they who can release others at pleasure,
will certainly deliver themselves: But
now I speak of that, I pray you tell me
if it be true that I have heard, that the
Pope when he dies, receives Absolution
from his Confessor, and that after his
death the Cardinals give him Absolution,
and give order for the singing of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Masses?</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>It is true, I was at</hi> Rome <hi>when the
last Pope died, and it was so then, and our
Books justifie it.</hi>

                  </sp>

                     <p>I am much pleased with your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity,
so the Pope gives the Priest a
power to pardon himself; methinks he
might save the charges of a Confessor;
it were enough to say, <hi>I absolve my self.</hi>
But tell me, do you say Masses for any that
are in Heaven or in Hell.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                     <p>No, we utterly disclaim that.</p>

                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>Then I perceive the Pope goes
into Purgatory. I see your Popes are not
self-seeking men (as they are slandered to
be) that help so many thousands out of
Purgatory, and leave themselves in.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <p>But really, this is to me a convincing
Argument, that you do not believe your
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:109465:113"/>
selves, but deceive poor silly people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
your Consciences: For else you
might be assured the Pope would never
come into Purgatory; for you say he can
keep himself out, and no man doubts of
his will to do it. Besides, your Doctrine
usurps upon God's Prerogative. I had
thought it was only my Father in Heaven
to whom I should have prayed, <hi>Forgive us
our Trespasses:</hi> Now it seems we must pray
so to one of these <hi>Padre's</hi> upon earth. You
make Subjects the supream Judges of all
Offences committed against their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
and your Priests sit as Umpires be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and the Sinner, and determine
what Satisfaction God shall have, and
what Penance the Sinner shall undergo.
Methinks they are brave fellows; and
I now see it was not without ground that
Father <hi>Cotton</hi> bragged, That <hi>he could do
any thing when he had his God in his hand,</hi>
(that was the Sacrament) <hi>and his King upon
his knees</hi> (in Confession.) I think you
will bring Christ upon his knees too, for
it seems you have resolved, that he shall
stand to your Priests Arbitration.</p>
                  <p>I might add to this, that you leave the
souls of people to endless perplexities;
you confess, that Indulgences profit not,
<hi>If a man be not in the state of grace</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Bell, de Indulg. l. 1. c. 13.</note>,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:109465:113"/>
(which you say a man cannot certainly
know) or <hi>if a man have not made a free

                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Concil. Trident. de Poenitentia.</note>and who knows when he hath done
these things sufficiently?) or <hi>if the Priest do
not intend to pardon him</hi> (and who knows
another mans intentions?) and yet you
would have me so desperate to venture
my soul upon such sandy foundations,
that your selves are afraid and ashamed
of. But, to leave this, I perceive that
this, and divers of your other Doctrines
are grounded upon that of the merit of
good works, which because I judge a
very pernicious and dangerous Doctrine;
let me hear what you can say for it:
but first, let me understand your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:
for I have heard some of you
cry out, that our Divines slandered them,
and profess that they did not hold Merit
strictly, but cast the honour of all upon
Christ and the grace of God; therefore
I pray you inform me.</p>

                     <p>I thank you for this objection: I
have scarce had any thing from you like
a solid Argument but this: It deserves
an Answer; First then, this will not reach
our case: The great hinderance of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in our works is, that the best of them
are imperfect, and a debt we owe to God
before hand; but Christs works are of
another kind, they are compleat and
perfect, and in part no debt; for though
when Christ was made Man, he was a
debtor to God, and bound as a creature
to fulfill the Law, yet this was a voluntary
act, and no debt to God, that he would
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:109465:115"/>
become Man, and so put himself under
the Law. Besides, the dignity of his
Person made his works proportionable
unto all the glory he received; whereas
<hi>all our sufferings are not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with our glory,</hi> Rom. 8. 18. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
It might be both an Inheritance and
Parchase in Christ in divers respects;
because he had two natures; as he was
God, or the Son of God, it was his Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
and belonged to his Manhood on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as united with the Godhead; as he was
Man, he might purchase it, by what he
did and suffered in the flesh: But in us
there are not two natures, nor any of
these pretences to merit. Moreover Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
speaks of two kinds of Rewards,
the one of Grace, the other of Debt,
and withal affirms, that the reward which
God gives to good men is meerly of
grace, (as we profess) and not of debt
(as you pretend) <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4.</p>

                     <p>It is true; but still the reward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be of grace, because it is alike to
him that came at the last hour, as to them
that had born the heat and burden of the

of Justice, and a due debt, (as you profess)
this Text proves not, and other Scriptures

                     <p>Not so neither; for since <hi>God

he may still keep the proportion, and to
them to whom he gives more grace here,
he may give more glory hereafter; and
yet there is no more merit in this addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
reward than in the rest. Again, I
may as well conclude, that the blind
men merited their sight, because Christ
saith, <hi>Be it unto you according to your faith,</hi>

                     <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> did not think this a good
Argument; for though he knew that it
was said of <hi>Abraham, Because thou hast
done this, I will bless thee,</hi> Gen. 22. 16, 17.

I hope you do not think his ignorance
merited mercy: The King saith, <hi>I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
thee all that debt, because thou desiredst
me,</hi> Mat. 18. 32. Did his asking deserve
it? Besides all this, if God did reward

                     <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> was not of your mind;
what good work is there but it lies either
in willing or doing? yet both these <hi>God

power of believing, but the act too, (and
suffering also) is <hi>the gift of God, Phil.</hi>
1. 29. and St. <hi>Pauls</hi> abundant labours
in the Gospel, which certainly amounted
to merit, if there were ever such a thing

<hi>I laboured, yet not I, but the grace of

                     <p>First, Why you defraud us of the
Cup.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Why you order Prayer to
be made in a language that many, nay,
most of us do not understand: For the
first, you rob us of one half of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:109465:120"/>
                        <hi>viz.</hi> of the Cup; what can
you say to acquit your selves from sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge?</p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>

to it.</hi>

                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>First, I remember you disputed
for Transubstantiation out of <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.
which, you said, spoke of the Sacrament;
now if you say true, there is a passage in
it, verse 53, <hi>except you eat the flesh of the
Son of man and drink his blood, you have no
life in you;</hi> if this be spoken of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
(as you say it is) and the wine be
really his blood, then you do no less than
murder all your people, by robbing them
of that which is necessary to their
life.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Not so, (for as I shall shew you) you
have the blood in the body (or bread.)</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>If it be so, yet my taking it in
that manner cannot be called a drinking
it, unless you will say that every man that
eats rawish meat, may be said to drink the
blood which he eats in it; but further, I
think we have as great right to the cup
as your Priests, we have Christs <hi>do this,</hi> and
you pretend no more; in short, we have
both the legacy and command of Christ
fortified with this strong reason, <hi>this cup
is the new Testament in my blood which is
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:109465:120"/>
shed for many for the remission of sins;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it sufficiently appears, that the signe
belongs to all that have interest in the
thing, and are capable of discerning the
Lords body; and this command of Christ
is express and positive, <hi>Mat. 26. Drink
ye ALL of it,</hi> it is remarkable that he
doth not say, eat ye <hi>all</hi> (though they were
to do so) but drink ye <hi>all</hi> of it, as fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
the sacriledge of your Church;
what can you say to this?</p>

                     <p>

an institution only.</hi>

                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>I understand no subtilties; but
if you say, this was no command of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
then it was no command of eating,
to say, <hi>take, eat,</hi> and so the Sacrament is
not commanded: but people may receive
or refuse it as they please, and Christs
<hi>do this</hi> is no more than <hi>do as you list;</hi> for
my part I shall never know when Christ
commands any thing, if this be not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
for no command can run in more
express words.</p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>
                        <hi>If this be a command, it concerns only</hi>
Priests, <hi>for such the Apostles were, and they
only were present.</hi>

                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>Since it is evident, that eating
and drinking belong to the same persons,
if the one be restrained to the Apostles;
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:109465:121"/>
so is the other, and because you confess
the eating belongs to the people by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of this precept. [<hi>Eat of it</hi>] by the
same reason also doth the drinking reach
to them also by vertue of that precept,
[<hi>Drink of it.</hi>] Besides the Apostles though
they were <hi>Ministers,</hi> yet in this act they
were in <hi>the peoples</hi> stead, and Christ was
the <hi>Minister</hi> or dispenser of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and they only the <hi>receivers</hi> of it at
this <hi>time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Besides, as they were <hi>Ministers</hi> he bad
them <hi>do this,</hi> that is, take and distribute
bread and wine to the people as he had
to them; If <hi>Ministers</hi> be under any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of administring and giving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
certainly it is here (for no
command can be more express) and if
they are commanded to give the bread to
the people, they are commanded to give
the wine also, for here is no difference at
all.</p>
                     <p>Adde to this that St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath put
this out of doubt, and he expounds this
of, and applies it to the people, for thus he
writes to all the Corinthians, <hi>Let a man
examine himself, and so let him eat of that
bread and drink of that Cup,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.
28. in four verses together, <hi>viz.</hi> 26, 27,
28, 29. eating and drinking are insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:109465:121"/>
joyned together, which you have so
wickedly divided: If it be a Command,
<hi>Let a man examine himself,</hi> (which none
will deny) then it is a Command (which
immediately follows) <hi>so let him eat this
Bread, and drink this Cup.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                     <p>It doth not appear, that there is an
absolute command of drinking, but only that
as oft as they do drink it, they should drink it
in remembrance of Christ.</p>

                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>If this be so, then here is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
for the Priest, either to Consecrate
the Cup, or to Receive it. And further,
then here is no command for his Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating
or receiving the Bread neither;
for there is no more than a <hi>Do this,</hi> and
that is for the Wine as well as for the
Bread.</p>

                     <p>Here is a difference, for he saith of

the forms of Bread and Wine—And although
in the Primitive Church this—Sacrament was
received by the faithful under both kinds</hi>—Yet
they make a Canon that it shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
under one kinde only. Is this so?</p>

                     <p>This was a wise Council indeed,
wiser than Christ and all his Apostles;
but I should think we are on the safest

Scripture is against you, and the Antient

here is as much said of the <hi>People,</hi> as of
the <hi>Ministers</hi> drinking of the Cup, that

                     <p>You need not be troubled so much

Cup: If I should dip bread in drink
and eat it, no man will say I drink
the bread. Again, this destroys the
main end of the Sacrament, which is to
shew forth Christs death, and the shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of his blood; and this was the
reason why Christ appointed the Bread
and Wine apart, as the fittest means to
bring to our memories, the pouring of
his blood out of his body for us; and
as God would have us to remember the
thing, so he commanded us to use this sign
of drinking the Cup.</p>

                     <p>1. In some Countries Wine is not to
be had. 2. Some there are who have an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
against Wine, and cannot drink any.
3. There is great danger of spilling the Wine,
which is the Blood of Christ.</p>

                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>Are these your weighty Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
I see the Reason and Religion of
<hi>Rome</hi> are both of a Complexion. But I
pray you how came it to pass, that
Christ and his Apostles, and all the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Christians for so many hundreds
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:109465:123"/>
of years should prescribe and use the
Cup, notwithstanding those reasons?
surely if these reasons are strong now,
they were so 1660. years ago: Wine
was as scarce then (as now it is) in some
Countries; abstemious persons were then
as well as now; the Wine might be spil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
then as much as now. But they
feared none of these things; either they
were all stupid that did not see these
things, or your Church is audacious,
that dare in effect teach Christ and his
Apostles, what they should have done.
It might peradventure be added, that in
such places where Wine cannot be had,
or for some persons who cannot drink
Wine, some other thing proportionable
to it may be allowed; but if it might
not, or if in such special cases they
were confined to one kind, I am sure it
is a ridiculous consequence, that because
they must be content with the Bread
that cannot drink of the Cup, therefore
they that can, shall go without it; and
because it may be omitted where it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be had, therefore it shall be omitted
where it may be enjoyed. And for the
danger of spilling of the Wine, there
is also danger in dropping some of the
Bread, and so that should be denied:
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:109465:124"/>
By this Argument also the Priest should
not meddle with the Wine, for he may
spill it; but indeed such phantastical
Reasons as these deserve no Answer;
they make me almost sick to hear them.</p>

                     <p>Well; then he tells us that what

2. Yet again, the Apostle commands that

must be interpreted, <hi>vers.</hi> 27. you disobey
this command. 3. He argues that Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Prayers are so to be made by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
that the People may say <hi>Amen, v.</hi> 16.
And he also tells us that no man can say

                     <p>You dispute not only against me,
but against the Apostle himself; but <hi>Amen,</hi>
though an <hi>Hebrew</hi> word, is by common use
sufficiently known to us all, to express our
consent to his Prayers, and confidence
that God will hear them. 4. Yet again, he
argues that strange Tongues are design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only for the Conviction of Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
not to be used be Believers amongst
themselves, unless interpreted, <hi>v.</hi> 22. What

                     <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                     <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks not of the ordinary
service of the Church, but of extraordinary
Hymnes and Songs.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>That is false; he speaks of the
ordinary service of the Church, though
at that time there was something ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:109465:125"/>
in it; and besides, his reasons
reach to all times and services, ordinary
or extraordinary; must we not look to
the Edification of the Church in the one
as well as the other? Must not the people
say <hi>Amen</hi> in one as well as the other? Let
me hear therefore what you have to say
for your selves.</p>

                     <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                     <p>Preaching ought to be in a known
language; for the end of that is the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Edification, but Prayers are made to
God.</p>

                     <p>Though they are made to God,
yet they are made by the Church, who
are to joyn in those Prayers, and to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
their consent by saying <hi>Amen,</hi> which
requires their understanding: And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
that Chapter speaks as expresly of
<hi>Praying</hi> as it doth of <hi>Prophesying</hi> in the
Church. Surely the people went not to
Church to sit there like senseless Images,
but to offer up a reasonable service, and
to tender their <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Praises</hi> unto
God by the mouth of the Minister, as
they did, <hi>Act. 4. 24, They lift up their
voice with one accord.</hi> And if we pray with
you, we must understand; else we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pray in faith (as it is our duty to do)
and we shall fall into their error to ask we
know not what.</p>

                     <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                     <p>You need not concern your self about
that; you may rely upon the wisdom and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Church, who takes care that your
prayers be right.</p>

                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>I confess there is this great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
for it, that your Church, it
seems, is wiser than St. <hi>Paul:</hi> but as a friend
I advise you to give this Counsel of rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon your Church to the <hi>Indians,</hi> or
some remote places, for they that know
her will never trust her. For my part, my
Saviours words make me cautious, <hi>If the
blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the
ditch.</hi> If I had no other argument of your
Churches Fallibility and Apostacy; this
one point were a sufficient evidence of
them both. But what have you more to
say?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pop.</speaker>
                     <p>I will give you then a Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
The Priests prayed in the Temple
when the People waited without, <hi>Luke</hi>
1. 21.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                     <p>What is this to the purpose? I do
not read, that the Priest prayed at all, but
only went in to offer Incense; but if he
did pray, he did it alone, not with and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the people, as your prayers are; you
might as well plead thu; Those Priests
said nothing at all, and therefore your
Priests need only make a dumb shew, and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:109465:126"/>
may serve their Latin (as well as their Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish)
which may be good counsel for many
of them, that have so little to spare.</p>
                     <p>But seriously can you, or any rational
man think, these reasons of sufficient
weight to oppose against that great Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
rule of Edification, and the express
words and plain arguments of St. <hi>Paul;</hi>
God deliver me from such a besotting
Religion.</p>
                     <p>Besides what I have said, I shall leave
this with you at parting, that you do not
only oppose Scripture, but also that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Church which you pretend to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and to follow her steps, and your
practice is contrary to the Church in all
antient times.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Iews</hi> in publick, were
alwayes made in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue, and in
that Tongue God gave them those forms
of Prayer and blessing which were then
used, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. 10.</p>
                     <p>God gave the gift of Languages to that
end, that the Apostles might establish the
Worship of God in every Nation in their
own Language: And I am told, that
<hi>Origen</hi> reports this, to be the practice of
the Church in this time (as well as his own
Judgment) That <hi>every one did pray to God
in his own dialect, Greeks in Greek, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:109465:126"/>
in Latin,</hi> &amp;c.<note n="a" place="bottom">

<hi>Whereas in many places there were mixed
