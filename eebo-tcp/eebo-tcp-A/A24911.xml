            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ON <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 4th inſtant at 10 in the Morning, the whole Fleet Anchored about 4 Mile without the <hi>Quince Channel,</hi> which leads to St. <hi>Malo;</hi> about Noon a Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal was made for the Commanders of the Bomb Veſſels to come on Board my Lord <hi>Berkley.</hi> It was ordered that 3 Engliſh and 6 Dutch Bomb-Veſſels ſhould batter the <hi>Quince Rick,</hi> and Fort called <hi>Dambour,</hi> and that the other Nine Engliſh Bomb Veſſels ſhould go in and batter the Town; accordingly about 4 in the Afternoon, Captain <hi>Benbow,</hi> who had the Command of them and of the Frigats that were to ſupport them, ſtood in, being himſelf on board the <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and battered the <hi>Quince,</hi> which he continued till it was Dark; one or two of our Bombs fell upon the Rock, and did the Enemy ſome damage. The 5th about 4 in the Morning, the Fleet weigh'd and went in nearer, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly my Lord <hi>Berkley</hi> made the Signal for the ſmall Frigats and Bomb Ships that were to Attack the Town, to go in; Captain <hi>Benbow</hi> went by his Lordſhips Order on board the <hi>Charles</hi> Galley, and there hoyſted a broad Pendant; at 6 they were all under Sail, and about the ſame time the <hi>Charles</hi> Fireſhip Commanded by Captain <hi>Durly,</hi> and a Dutch Fireſhip, were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to go and lie cloſe to the <hi>Quince</hi> Rock, and there to blow up their Ships, which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed very Gallantly, and ſoon after the Fort took Fire, (whether occaſioned by the blowing up of the Fireſhips, or the falling of a Bomb, we cannot tell) which laſted near two Hours; and during that time we ſaw ſeveral Blowings up, which we ſuppoſe was by ſome Powder taking Fire; and we conjecture ſome of their Guns were likewiſe diſmounted thereby, for they did not fire upon us afterwards ſo much as they did before. About 7 in the Morning, our Bomb Ships and Frigats were laid to Paſs, and plaid on the Town, the Bomb Veſſels lying ſo near, that they were forced to abate of their Powder, for otherwiſe the Bombs would have gone over the Town. About 10 they ſet Fire to the Eaſtward part of it, which broke out in two places; and at two in the Afternoon, we ſaw another Fire about the middle of the Town, which continued till it was Dark, blazing over the tops of the Houſes, but at laſt it was put out by the blowing up of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes near it. The Ships that went in were 6 Engliſh and 4 Dutch men of War, 9 Bomb Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, 14 Well-Boats, 2 Brigantines, and one Spy Boat, who lay in the midſt of the Enemies Batteries, and received the Fire from 9 or 10 of them, and returned the ſame with great Bravery and Reſolution; but moſt of the Enemies Shot went over us; and their Gallies and Guard Boats which were ſent out to annoy us, took care never to come within point blank Shot of us: My Lord <hi>Berkley</hi> was himſelf in the hotteſt of the Fire, going in his Boat to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage our Men, and to give ſuch Orders as he thought neceſſary. The Frigats and Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boats appointed to attend on the <hi>Bomb</hi> Veſſels during the Action, being placed by Captain <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow,</hi> were very ſerviceable to them, both in ſecuring them from the Enemy and ſupplying them with Ammunition. We Fired 900 Bombs and Carcaſſes into the Town, a great part of which is certainly burnt or beat down. and we believe there is little part of it free from ſome ſhare in the Deſolation. Several of the Enemies Shot were taken up in our Ships and Veſſels, ſome of which were ſhot from Canon of Seven, the leaſt from Demy-Canon; one of their Bombs fell into the <hi>Carc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>About 7 in the Evening, a Signal was made for the Bomb Veſſels and Frigats to come off, as they did, after having Bomb'd 11 Hours, and done all that could be expected from them. In this Action we had about 60 Men killed and wounded; one of our Bomb Veſſels called the <hi>Dreadful,</hi> being very much ſhatter'd and diſabled by the Enemies Cannon, the Commander and his Men quitted the Veſſel, after ſetting her on Fire; Three of the Well-boats were Sunk, and 3 or 4 other Boats.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> the 6th, Captain <hi>Benbow</hi> was Detach'd with 8 Bomb Ships, and as many Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats to Bombard <hi>Granville;</hi> and my Lord <hi>Berkley</hi> with the reſt of the Fleet Sailed to <hi>Jaſey.</hi>
