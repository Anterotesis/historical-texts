            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>For the Estate of the Commons,
that they all in a Christian obedience,
towardes each and euerie of their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,
and in a godly loue, with the
frutes and duties there of one towards
another, maye walke worthie of that
glorious calling whereunto they are
called. And that the blessings of the
Lord may not only be with vs for our

to our posterity: let vs beseech
God, that he will visit with the spirite
of his grace, the two Vniuersities,
<hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> all Schooles of
<pb facs="tcp:293:10"/>
learning, and places of education of
youth: that they being watered with
the deaw of his blessing, maye yeeld
foorth such plants, as may both serue
for a present supply of the Churches
need: and also in such sort furnish the
generations that are to come, that our

the Lord, for a holy seede, and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

               <p>And thus recommending our selues vnto
the praiers of Christ his Church, as wee haue
commended Christ his whole Church by our
praiers vnto the Maiestie of Almightie God,
reposing our trust and confidence, neyther in
our owne prayers, nor in the Churches pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
but in the alone mediation of Christ Iesus
our Aduocate: Let vs vnto him, (as vnto our

            <p>THen was Iesus led aside of the Spirit
into the wildernesse, to be tempted of
the diuell.</p>
            <p>2 And when he had fasted fortie daies
&amp; 40. nights, he was afterward hungry.</p>
            <p>3 Then came to him the Tempter, &amp;
said, If thou be the Sonne of God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
that these stones be made bread.</p>
            <p>4 But he answering said, It is written,
Man shal not liue by bread onely, but by
euerie word that proceedeth out of the
mouth of God.</p>
            <p>5 Then the diuell tooke him vp into
<pb facs="tcp:293:12"/>
the holy Cittie, and set him on a pinacle of
the Temple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>6 And saide vnto him, If thou be the
Sonne of God, cast thy selfe downe: for it
is written, that he will giue his Angelles
charge ouer thee, and with their handes
they shall lift thee vp, least at any time
thou sholdst dash thy foot against a stone.</p>
            <p>7 Iesus said vnto him, It is written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy

the glorie of them,</p>
            <p>9 And saide to him, All these will I

by the second, hee entred bound for
the performing of it. All was to this
end, that he might restore the worke
<pb facs="tcp:293:14"/>
of God to his originall perfection. In
the bringing of which to passe, it was
decreed by God in the beginning (as a
thing necessarie) that the head of the
Serpent (by whose meanes it was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
and defaced) should bee brused.<note place="margin">1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ioh. 3. 8</note>
And <hi>For this cause</hi> (saith Saint Iohn)
<hi>appeared the Sonne of GOD, that hee
might loose the workes of the Diuell:</hi>
whereof this was the first. For in
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. wee read, that his first worke
after his fall, was enuiously to tempt
our first parents, and thereby to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow
all man-kinde. And heere,
streight after our Sauiour was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
hee with like enuie setteth on
him. Christ therefore first beginneth
with the ouercomming of that: and
for that purpose he is heere led forth
to be tempted, that so being tempted
he might ouercome.</p>
            <p>Our Sauiour makes this question,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 7. vpon their going out to
see <hi>Iohn Baptist, What went yee out to
see?</hi> As if he should haue said, They
would haue neuer gone out into the

wildernesse, except it had been to see
some great and worthie matter: and
behold a greater and a worthier mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

to behold, this is a matter much wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie

worthy the hearing, it is worthy our
attention to heare; not <hi>Michael</hi> the
Archangel disputing about the body
of <hi>Moses</hi> with the diuell, <hi>Iude</hi> 9. but
our owne matter, argued by two such

            <p>Though there shuld come no profit
to vs by the victorie, yet were it worth
the sight, in this respect, onely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
how these Champions behaue
themselues; that so we may be warned
before hand, by seeing the strength of
our Aduersarie: and that also seeing
the manner of his fight, and of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours
defence, we may be instructed
how to arme our selues, and how to
ward accordingly. For let vs be sure,
that since the Diuell spared not to
tempt our Sauiour, he will bee much
more bold with vs: If he haue doone
this to the greene tree, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of the drie? <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 31. If hee
haue sought our ouerthrow in Christ,
how much more will he doo it in our

2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. then is it behoouefull
for vs, to haue some intelligence of our

is said to be the holy Ghost: 4. the end,
which was the conflict it selfe, that is,
to be tempted: 5. the day of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,

               <head>I.</head>
               <p>First, for the partie defendaunt,
Christ, who (as God) giueth food to
euerie liuing creature, <hi>Psal.</hi> 136. 25. and
(as God and man) with fiue loaues &amp;
two fishes fed 5000. besides women
and children, <hi>Matt.</hi> 14. 11. He that is
said to be the verie meate it self, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we liue eternally, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. is here said
to be hungrie. He, before whom thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
thousands are said to minister, &amp;
10000. thousands are said to stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 10. hath heere for his
companions the wilde beasts: for so
saith <hi>Mark.</hi> chapt. 1. 13. He, to whom
the Angels minister, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. is heere
assayled with diuels, which offer vnto
him matter of great indignitie; and
the indignitie which he suffered, leads
vs to the consideration of the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uousnes
of our sinnes, &amp; of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of his loue, both which are mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
by the greatnes of those things
hee suffered for vs; as that hee was
cast out from among the company of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:293:16"/>
Angels (for so <hi>Marke cap. 1. vers.</hi> 12.
hath it) into the Desert, to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
of beasts, and so led foorth to
bee tempted; where hee suffered in
his bodie hunger, in his soule tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
what is it else, but a proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of his great loue toward vs? As
if hee should (exulting) say, What is
it that shall seperate mee from the
loue of men? Shall temptation? shall
solitarinesse? shall hunger? shall
wearisome labour and trauell? shall
watching? shall anguish of minde,
and bloudie sweate? shall mockes?
shall whippes? shall nayles? shall
speares? shall principalities? That
wee also might vse the same chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
which <hi>Paule</hi> dooth in the 8.
Chapter of his Epistle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi>
the 35. verse, <hi>What shall sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
vs from the loue of Christ? shall
tribulation? shall anguish? or persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
These two profitable poynts
grow out of the consideration of the
person of the defendant.</p>

               <head>II.</head>
               <p>Secondly, the partie assailant is the
Diuell, who is so called, by reason of
his foule mouth in defaming: for so
dooth the word <hi>Diabolus</hi> import,
whereby we haue occasion to detest
the sinne of infamie: and it sheweth
what name they deserue, and how to
be esteemed of, in whom that quality
is found. S. <hi>Paule 2. Tim.</hi> 3. 3. foretold,
that in the latter daies there should be
men diuels, foule mouthed men, euill
speakers: and 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 11. he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of women diuels, because of their
calumnious speaches. In the tongue
wherein Christ spake these words,
namely the Syriack, the fittest woord
that he could finde to signifie the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells
name, is a word that signifieth
<hi>Diuulgator:</hi> so that a publisher of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
reports, is good Syriacke for
the diuell; as when a man lightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaues
a reproach, either forging it
himselfe by misconstruction, or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulously
receiuing it vpon the report
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:293:17"/>
of others, and then is not sorrie for his
brothers ill, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 22. but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulteth;
not considering<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
may fall into the like temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>Galat.</hi> 6. 1. and so becomes puffed
vp, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2. and at last falls a blazing
his brothers imperfections, 3. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10.
these come right to the diuells quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
they take vpon them the abetting
of the diuels quarrell.</p>
               <p>It is the Diuells occupation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame
vs first with God, as he did <hi>Iob,</hi> as
if he had been an hypocrite, and had
serued God onely for gaine, <hi>Iob.</hi> 1. 9.
and so stands he continually accusing
vs, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12. 10. and he also defameth
God with vs, as if he were a God that
did enuie our good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1. and so he
here defameth God to Christ, as if he
were carelesse in prouiding for him,
in suffering him to be hungrie. And
from these two defamations proceeds
all euill whatsoeuer, aswell that which
the Diuines cal <hi>Malum poenae,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi>
1. 12. accusing <hi>Iob,</hi> that he would curse
God if he handled him roughly, and
<pb facs="tcp:293:18"/>
so got power ouer his goods: as that
which they call <hi>Malum culpae.</hi> For
his defaming God with vs, was the
cause of all sin: and euerie where still
we see hee laboureth to perswade vs,
that God is an vnkinde God; that so
we may burst forth into those termes,
<hi>This good did I get at Gods hand, 2. Ki.</hi>
6. 33. to wit, hunger. To this doth he
tempt Christ <hi>vers.</hi> 3. And as to despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
so sometimes to the contrarie,
presumption, as <hi>vers. 6. Cast thy selfe
downe, &amp;c.</hi> by bringing vs to haue a
base conceit of God, defaming him as
if he were a God of cloutes, not to be
reckned of, as if he were a man to wait
vpon vs, and to take vs vp as oft as we
list to throw our selues down, that we
may say in our harts, as they that were
frozen in their dregs did, <hi>Sophon. 1. 12
He neither dooth good nor hurt, it is all
one to serue him, and not to serue him.</hi>
Hee tells vs (as <hi>verse.</hi> 9.) that hee will
giue vs all this, if wee will fall downe
and worship him, as though he were
verie liberall in rewards, &amp; as though
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:293:18"/>
God were vnkinde or vngratefull, not
once regarding vs for all our seruice,
but suffers vs euen to starue. Which
brought men to that passe, as to say,
<hi>Malach.</hi> 3. 14. that <hi>It is but in vaine to
serue God, what gaine is in his seruice?</hi>
If he cannot preuaile this way against
vs, then he will trie another way: for,
when (seeing that this temptation suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
not) the diuell left Christ, he
departed not for altogether, but went
to come againe (as appeareth in the
fourth of <hi>Luke,</hi> verse. 13. he departed
for a time. Christ was too cunning
for him in disputing; he meant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to take another course: for as
<hi>Iames</hi> noteth, chapt. 1. vers. 14. there
bee two sorts of temptations, one by
inticement, as a Serpent; another by
violence, as a Lyon; if he cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
as a Serpent, he wil play the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Hee had also another hower at
Christ in the garden, the hower of
darknesse, <hi>Luc.</hi> 22. 53. there he brused
his heele.</p>

               <head>III.</head>
               <p>Thirdly, we are to consider the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<hi>He was led by the spirite.</hi> In which
wee are to note fiue things: not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any question, but that it was the
good Spirite, for so it appeareth in
<hi>Luke.</hi> 4. 1.</p>
               <p>First, that the state of a man rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
by Baptisme, is not a standing
still, <hi>Matt. 20. 6. He found others stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
idle in the market place, and he said
to them, Why stand ye idle all day?</hi> We
must not only haue a mortifying and
reuiuing, but a quickening and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
spirite. 1. <hi>Corin.</hi> 15. 45. which will
mooue vs, and cause vs to proceede:
wee must not lye still like lumpes of
flesh, laying all vppon Christs shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 16. wee must walke for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
for the kingdom of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
not in words, but in power, 1. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint.</hi>
4. 19.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as there must bee a stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
so this stirring must not be such,
as when a man is left to his owne vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:293:19"/>
or naturall motion: we must
goe according as we are lead. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
giuen our selues to God, we are
no longer to be at our owne dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or direction: whereas before our
calling, we were Gentiles, and were
carried into errours, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2. wee
wandred vp &amp; down as masterles or
carelesse, or else gaue heede to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of diuels, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 4. or else led
with diuers lusts, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6. But now
beeing become the children of God,
we must be led by the spirite of God:
for so manie as be the sonnes of God,
are led therby, <hi>Ro.</hi> 8. 14. We must not
be led by the spirite, whence the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation
came <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 22. from
whence reuelations of flesh and blood
doo arise: but by the spirite from
whence the voyce came, <hi>This is my
beloued sonne, in whom I am well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi>
It came not by the spirite that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistreth
wise counsell, but by that
which came downe vpon them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the manner of leading, is
described to be such a kind of leading
<pb facs="tcp:293:20"/>
as when a shippe is loosed from the
shoare, as <hi>Luke.</hi> chapter 8. verse. 22.
it is called launching forth: so in the
eighteenth chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> the
31. verse, <hi>Paule</hi> is said to haue sailed
foorth.</p>
               <p>The holy Ghost driuing vs, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to a gale of wind, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 8. which
teacheth vs, that as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wind blo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth,
we must be readie to hoyse vp
sayle: so must we make vs readie to be
led by the spirit. Our hope is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to an anchor, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 19. which
must be haled vp to vs; and our faith
to the saile, wee are to beare as great a
sayle as we can. Wee must also looke
to the closenes of the vessell, which is
our conscience: for if wee haue not a
good conscience, wee may make ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke
of faith, religion, and all, 1. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth,</hi>
1. 19. And thus are wee to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
in our iourney towardes our
Countrey, the spirituall <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as
it were sea-faring men. <hi>Actes.</hi> 20. 22.
<hi>Now behold I goe bound in spirite to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem:</hi>
to which iourney the loue of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:293:20"/>
Christ must constrayne vs. 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi>
5. 14,</p>
               <p>Fourthlie, that hee was led to bee
tempted. His temptation therefore
came not by chance, nor as <hi>Iob</hi> chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
5. vers. 6. speaketh, out of the dust,
or out of the earth, nor from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
for hee had no power without
leaue, not onely ouer <hi>Iobs</hi> person, <hi>Iob.</hi>
1. 12. but not so much as ouer his
goods, <hi>verse</hi> 14. He had no power of
himselfe so much as ouer the hogs of
the <hi>Gergashites,</hi> who were prophane
men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 31.</p>
               <p>Hence gather wee thys com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
that the Holie Ghost is not a
stander by (as a straunger) when
wee are tempted, <hi>Tanquam otiosus
spectator:</hi> but hee leades vs by the
hand, and standes by as a faythfull
Assistant, <hi>Esay</hi> chapter 4. vearse. 13.
Hee makes an issue out of all our
temptations, and will not suffer vs
to bee tempted aboue our strength,
1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> chapt. 10. vers. 13. And hee
turneth the worke of sinne, and of
<pb facs="tcp:293:21"/>
the diuel too, vnto our good, <hi>Ro.</hi> 8. 28.
So that all these shall make vs more
warie after to resist them: and hell,
by fearing it, shall be an occasion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, to auoyd that might bring vs to
it: and so they shall all be fellow-hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
to our saluation. So that tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
whether they be (as the fathers
call them) rods to chasten vs for sinne
committed, or to trie and sift vs, <hi>Mat.</hi>
3. 12. and so to take away the chaffe,
the fanne is in the holie Ghosts hand:
or whether they bee sent to buffet vs
against the pricke of the flesh, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi>
12. 17. or whether they bee as matters
seruing for our experience, not onely
for our selues, that we may know our
owne strength, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3. and to work
patience in vs: but to the diuell also,
that so his mouth may be stopped, as
in <hi>Iob. 2. 3. Hast thou marked my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
Iob, how vpright he is, and that in
all the world there is not such a one?</hi>
Howsoeuer they be, the Diuell hath
not the rodde or chayne in his hands,
but the holy Ghost to order them, as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:293:21"/>
may best serue for his glorie and our
good: and as for the diuell, he bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him fast, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 20. 2.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, by the Greeke word heere
vsed, is set foorth the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the temptations of the Saints,
and reprobates. In the Lords Prayer
one petition is, <hi>Lead vs not into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</hi>
but there, the Word import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
another manner of leading, than
is heere meant. Wee doo not there
pray against this manner of leading
heere, which is so to lead vs, as to be
with vs, and to bring vs backe againe,
<hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. 20. but we pray there, that he
would not cast or driue vs into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;
and when we are there, leaue
vs, by withdrawing his grace and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Spirit, as he doth from the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
and forsaken.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="part">
               <head>IIII.</head>
               <p>The fourth point, is the end, that is,
the Conflict, as it concerneth Christ,
insomuch that he was led to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
In which temptation <hi>Augustine,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:293:22"/>
saith, <hi>Habemus &amp; quod credentes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neremur,
&amp; quod videntes imitamur:</hi>
There bee two things for faith to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,
and two things for imitation to
practise.</p>
               <p>First for faith, that the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Christ, haue sanctified temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
vnto vs: that whereas before
they were curses, like vnto hanging
on a tree; now, since Christ hath bin
both tempted and hanged on a tree,
they be no longer signes and pledges
of Gods wrath, but fauours. A man
may be the childe of GOD notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and therfore he is not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
anie discouragement by anie of
them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, besides the sanctifying, it
is an abatement, so that now when we
are tempted, they haue not the force
they had before: for now the serpents
head is brused, so that he is now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so strong (as he was) to cast his
darts. Also the head of his darts are
blunted, <hi>1. Cor. 15. 55. Death, where is
thy sting? Hell, where is thy victorie?</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:293:22"/>
For as his death and resurrection had
a mortifying force against the olde
man, and a quickening force toward
the new man: so hath his temptation
a dulling force to the Diuell, and a
strengthning force to vs.</p>
               <p>For our life and imitation, there are
also two. First, Compassion: for
Christ knowing in what sort we were
tempted, as hauing felt by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
both how strong the assaylaunt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
was, <hi>Psa.</hi> 118. 13. who thrust sore at
him that he might fall; &amp; how feeble
our nature is to make resistaunce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothing
but dust, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 103. 14. he is
mooued thereby to lay away seuerity,
and to put on the bowels of compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
So that <hi>Now we haue not a high
Priest which cannot be tempted with our
infirmities, but was tempted in like sort,
Heb.</hi> 4. 15. So we, (which were before
stonie Iudges, and too rough for phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians)
ought in like sort (hauing bin
tempted our selues) to looke vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
defects with a more passionate
regard.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:293:23"/>The second thing we are to imitate,
Christ is our fellow-helper in all our
necessities and temptations; who, as
hee sheweth vs his sleights and darts,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 14. so he teacheth vs how to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd
them. This is no small comfort
to vs, when we consider that he is with
vs, and will bee till the ende of the
world, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. 20. who hath ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the world, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 16. 33. and the
diuell: If anie temptation happen,
that he will beare vs out, we may bee
of good cheere. This was it that did
so animate <hi>Iob, Doo thou but take my
part, and who shall touch me? Iob.</hi> 17. 3.
When as both Christ and wee drawe
together in one yoke, <hi>Matth,</hi> 11. 29.
what can hurt vs? Yet if we be afeard
for that we see the enemie comming;
let vs call for the help of our assistant,
and as it is said in <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 1. we shall
see <hi>God will arise, and his enemies shall
be scattered: they shall vanish like smoke,
and melt like waxe.</hi> When they are
readie to attach vs, let vs say, <hi>Saue mee
O God, for the waters are entred euen
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:293:23"/>
into my soule. Psalm.</hi> 69. 1. When wee
are feeble, then let vs say with <hi>Exeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
O Lord it hath oppressed mee, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
me, Ezek.</hi> 38. 14. Or though they
haue wounded vs, let vs say with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
Bring out thy speare, and stop the
way against them that persecute mee.
Psalm. 35. 3. Say yet to my soule, I am
thy saluation.</hi> So that wee haue not
onely an example, but a comfort too.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="part">
               <head>V.</head>
               <p>The fift poynt, is the day and time
when this was done, in which we are
to note two things. The word <hi>Then</hi>
relateth as well to the ende of the
chapter next going before, as to the
present instant.</p>
               <p>First then, when as Christ was but
newly come out of the water of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
and immediately after the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
had opened vnto him, and the
holy Ghost descended vppon him in
the likenes of a Doue, and while hee
was yet full of the holy Ghost; did
the Diuell set vppon him. When as
<pb facs="tcp:293:24"/>
the voyce from heauen had pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
<hi>This is my beloued sonne, in whom
I am well pleased;</hi> the diuell straight
addeth, In whom I am ill pleased: &amp;
so addresseth himselfe agaynst him.
And it is Gods propertie to looke for
much at his hands, to whom hee hath
giuen much. When he giues a man a
large measure of grace, hee giues the
diuell withall a large patent. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
had great gifts, and the diuell
is like a theefe, that will venter most
for the greatest bootie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in regard of the present,
wee are to note, that in 30. yeares the
diuell did nothing to our Sauiour:
but now when he goes about to gyrd
himselfe with our saluation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Psalm.</hi> 45. 3. then doth the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
gird on his sword also; that is as
much to say, as the better the worke
is, the more resistaunce it shall haue.
Ten repulses did the <hi>Israelites</hi> suffer,
before they could get possession of
the promised Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> and
as manie did <hi>Dauid</hi> endure, before he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:293:24"/>
was inuested in the promised King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Manie lets came before the
Temple was reedified, as is to bee
seene in <hi>Esdras</hi> and <hi>Nehemias.</hi> Yea?
(saith the diuell) Hath God annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him with the oyle of gladnesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
his fellowes? I will see if I can
annoynt him with the oyle of sadnes
aboue his fellowes. Hath hee beene
baptised of water and the holy ghost?
I will prouide another Baptisme for
him, namely of fire. Hath God sent
downe the holie Ghost vppon him in
likenes of a Doue? I will cause tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation,
and a crowne of thornes to
light vpon his head. Hath a voyce
come downe from Heauen, saying,
<hi>This is my beloued Sonne?</hi> I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
a voice for him, that shall ascend
from the foote, that shall say, <hi>If thou
bee the Sonne of God, come downe from
the Crosse.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="part">
               <head>VI.</head>
               <p>The sixt is the place, the Lystes,
to wit, the Wildernesse, that so hee
<pb facs="tcp:293:25"/>
might be alone, and that there might
be no fellow-worker with him in the
matter of our saluation, that he alone
might haue the treading of the wine-presse,
<hi>Esa.</hi> 63. 3. So in his Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in the mount, he was found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
<hi>Luc.</hi> 9. 36. So in the garden in his
great agonie, he was in effect alone;
for his Disciples slept all the while,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 40. that vnto him might bee
ascribed all the praise.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we will note heere, that
there is no place priuiledged from
te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptations, as ther be some that think
there be certain places to be exempt
from Gods presence, (as was noted in
the dreame of <hi>Iacob</hi>) so the Monkes
and Heremites thought, that by auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
companie, they should bee free
from temptations; which is not so.
For, although Christ were alone in
the wildernes, and fasting too, yet
was he tempted we see. And yet it is
true, that he that will liue well, must
shunne the companie of the wicked,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:293:25"/>When the Angells had brought <hi>Lot</hi>
&amp; his familie out of the doores, they
charged him not to tarie, nor to stand
still, nor once to looke backe. So af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Cocke had crowed, and put
<hi>Peter</hi> in minde of his fall; hee went
out of the doores and wept bitterly,
<hi>Matt.</hi> 26. 75. his solitarinesse was a
cause to make his repentaunce the
more earnest, and helped to increase
his teares: and companie is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a hindrance to the receiuing of any
good grace, and to the exercising and
confirming vs in anie good purpose.
But as true it is, that temptations are,
and may as well be in the deserts, as in
publike places: not onely in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes,
but in the mountaines, <hi>verse</hi> 8.
and not onely in the countrey, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in the holie Citie, <hi>vers.</hi> 5. yea, and
sometimes ful, and sometimes fasting,
yea, in paradice and in heauen it self;
for thether dooth the diuell come and
accuse vs before God: wee are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
alwayes to stand vpon our gard.
For in the II. chap. of <hi>Luke</hi> verse. 24.
<pb facs="tcp:293:26"/>
He is said to walke through drie pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
least happily some might be esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
from him thither: and though
wee could goe whether hee could not
come, we should not be free: for wee
carrie euer a tempter about with vs.
And when wee pray to bee deliuered
from temptation, it is not onely from
the diuell, but from our selues, we ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
fire within vs. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil</hi>
were of that minde once, that by
change of the place a man might goe
from temptation: but afterward they
recanted it, affirming that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to auoyde temptation, yea,
though he went out of the world, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he left his hart behind him also.</p>

It may seeme strange,
that beeing about to
present himselfe to the
world, as Prince, Priest, and Prophet,
that he would make his progresse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Wildernesse, and begin with a
fast: for this was cleane contrarie to
the course and fashion of the World,
which vseth when any great matter is
in hand, to make a Preface, or <hi>Praelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
with some great solemnitie. As
<pb facs="tcp:293:27"/>
when <hi>Salomon</hi> came first to his crown,
he went to the chiefe Citie, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
a solemne conuent. So Christ
should rather first haue gone to <hi>

                  </gap>ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
the holy Citie, and there should
haue been some solemne banquet. But
Christ from his Baptisme began his
calling, and fasted fortie dayes &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
nights. This his fast (by the new
Writers) is called the entraunce into
his calling: by the olde Writers, it
is called the entraunce into hi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict.</p>
            <p>The manner of the Church hath
alwayes been, that at the first institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or vndertaking of anie great and
weightie matter, there hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie
fasting. So <hi>Moses</hi> (<hi>Deut.</hi>
9. 9.) when he entred into his calling,
at the receyuing of the Lawe, fasted
fortie dayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So <hi>Elias</hi> (1. <hi>King.</hi> 19. 18.)
at the restoring of the same Law did
the like. And so when they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the reedifying of the Temple,
as appeareth <hi>Esdr.</hi> 8. 49. So in the
new Testament, at the seperation of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:293:27"/>
               <hi>Paule</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Act.</hi> 13. 3. And
(as <hi>Ierome</hi> reporteth) Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>
would not vndertake to write the
the diuine woorke of his Gospell,
vntill the whole Church (by Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
had recommended the same vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God.</p>
            <p>So likewise at the entraunce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a conflict, for the obtayning of
some Victorie, as <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> did
when hee ouercame the <hi>Amorites,</hi>
2. of the Chronicles chapter 20. the
3. verse. So did <hi>Hester</hi> when shee
went about the deliueraunce of the
Iewes, as in the fourth of <hi>Hester</hi> the
sixteenth verse. And <hi>Eusebius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth,
that when <hi>Peter</hi> was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
disputation with <hi>Simon Magus,</hi>
there was fasting of the whole Church
generally.</p>
            <p>Whether at the entraunce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a calling, or to resist the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel,
Saint <hi>Peters</hi> rule mentioned in his
first Chapter and fifth verse, ought
to take place, we must vse prayer and
fasting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:293:28"/>
And as at all times wee are to vse
watchfulnesse and carefulnesse: so
then especially, when wee looke that
the diuell will be most busie; and the
rather, for that in some cases, there is
no dealing without fasting, as <hi>Mar.</hi>
9. 29. there is a kinde of diuell that
will not bee cast out, without prayer
and fasting.</p>
            <p>As for the number of dayes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he fasted, iust fortie, Curiositie may
finde it selfe worke enough: but it is
daungerous to make Conclusions,
when no certaintie appeareth.</p>
            <p>Some say, there is a corresponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
betweene these fortie dayes, and
the fortie dayes wherein the World
was destroyed by the Deluge: but it
is better to say, As <hi>Moses</hi> fasted for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
daies at the institution of the law,
and <hi>Elias</hi> fortie at the restauration: so
Christ heere. And because hee came
but in the shape of a seruaunt, hee
would not take vpon him aboue his
fellow-seruaunts: Contrarie to our
times, wherein a man is accounted no
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:293:28"/>
bodie, except hee can haue a quirke
aboue his fellowes. But it is more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall,
to see how it concerneth vs.
It is a thing rather to bee adored by
admiration, than to be followed by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
imitation.</p>
            <p>This fast heere was not the fast of
a day, as that of <hi>Peter,</hi> and of <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
Act.</hi> 10. 9, 30. but such as <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 2.
describeth, he did eate nothing al that
time. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist (though
his life were verie strict) did eate Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs
and wilde honnie, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 4.
Ours is not properly a fast, but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation
of meates; and therefore
there can be no proportion betweene
them: but as it is, what is to be thought
of it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> record, that at
the first, the Church did vse to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
but one day in remembrance of
Christes Fast; till after, the <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi>
(a certaine sect of heretikes, who
thereupon were called <hi>Eucratitae</hi>) rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it to fourteene dayes; the zeale of
<pb facs="tcp:293:29"/>
the Clergie after increased it to fortie,
after to fiftie, the Monkes brought it
to sixtie, the Friars to seuentie; and if
the Pope had not there staid it, they
would haue brought it to eightie, and
so haue doubled Christs fast.</p>
            <p>When the Primitiue Church sawe
the Heretikes (by this outward shew)
goe about to disgrace the Christians,
by this counterfet shew of holinesse;
they vsed it also: but (saith <hi>Augustine</hi>
and <hi>Chrisostome</hi>) they held it onely a
positiue law, which was in the church
to vse or take away, &amp; not as any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of godlines.</p>
            <p>Onely a doubt resteth now, because
of the hardnesse of mens harts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were better left or kept. Some
would haue abstinence vsed, and one
day kept for the Saboth, but left to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
mans libertie what time &amp; day,
&amp; tied to no certaintie: but that were
(vpon the matter) to haue none kept
at all.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding, the reformed
Churches (as that of <hi>Fraunce</hi>) haue
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:293:29"/>
vsed their libertie in remoouing of it,
for that they sawe an inclination in
their people to superstition, who
would thinke themselues holier for
such fasting; like the Pharisies, <hi>Luke</hi>
18. 12. The Church wherein we liue,
vseth her libertie in retayning it, and
that vpon good reasons: for sith God
hath created the fishes of the sea for
man, and giuen him an interest in
them also, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 2. as well as in the
beasts. Sith the death of fish was a
plague wherwith God plagued <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi>
and so contrariwise the encrease
of fish is a blessing: God will haue
fish to bee vsed, so that hee may haue
praises as well for the sea as for the
land. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 104. 25.</p>
            <p>If wee looke into the ciuill reason,
we shall see great cause to obserue it.
See <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 22. the abundaunce of
flesh that was consumed in one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.
The maintenance of store then
is of great importance, and therefore

&amp;c.</p>
            <p>Before wee come to the particular
temptations, wee haue foure generall
poynts to bee considered. First, the
changing of the diuels name, from <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell</hi>
to <hi>Tempter:</hi> secondly, that it is
said, <hi>He came vnto him:</hi> thirdly, that
he came when he was fasting: fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the diuersitie &amp; order of the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>I.</head>
               <p>First, in <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 13. it is said, that
GOD tempteth no man; and yet in
<hi>Deu.</hi> 13. 3. it appeareth, that God doth
tempt some; we must then make dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betweene temptations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Gods temptations, and the
diuels. The diuell indeede tempteth
vs, but God (as our English translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath it) trieth vs. The latter is to
commend vs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 5. or rather that
our tribulation may bring forth pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb facs="tcp:293:31"/>
and patience hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3. It
makes vs knowe that to bee in our
selues, which before we knew not, as
we see in <hi>Iob.</hi> So the Lord proued the
<hi>Israelites,</hi> to see if they loued him or
no, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 3. The diuells temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is to knowe our corruption: for
knowing the innocencie of <hi>Adam,</hi> he
went about to corrupt him. It is lyke
the <hi>Israelites</hi> proouing of Manna, to
trie conclusions. Gods is like the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
of golde, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7. which the oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
it is tryed. the purer it Waxeth:
the diuels, like that of Manna, which
stinketh and corrupteth by triall.
Gods is like the triall of the fanne,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 12. the diuells like that of
the siue, <hi>Luc.</hi> 22. 31. which lets go the
flower, and keepes the branne.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="part">
               <head>II.</head>
               <p>Secondly, the Diuell hath two
shapes; in the one he tempteth and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lureth,
(and in that came hee now to
our Sauiour): in the other, hee assay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs, that is, by assault and violence,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:293:31"/>
                  <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 11. The first is the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of hypocrites: <hi>Matth. 22. 18. Shall
we pay tribute to Caesar?</hi> The second, of
<hi>Iudas,</hi> who in the garden assaulted our
Sauiour, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 70. So sathan sets on
Christ by violence. Hee came vnto
Christ, by casting sparkes of fire into
him; for he was deuoyd of anie wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and vaine thoughts comming
foorth of him.</p>
               <p>Two waies may a man be tempted:
either by doubts arising in our hearts
out of vs, <hi>Lu.</hi> 24. 38. or by a sop entring
into vs. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 27. Christ could not be
tempted the first way: for he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd
of any wicked &amp; vain thoughts
comming forth of him. To vs the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
needes bring but a paire of bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
for he shall finde fire within vs:
but to Christ hee was faine to bring
fire too.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="part">
               <head>III.</head>
               <p>Thirdly, he then came to him when
he was fasting, which discouereth the
diuels desperate boldnesse, as also his
<pb facs="tcp:293:32"/>
craftinesse, in that he waited his time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to stay till he was hungrie. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
Christ was newly come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
his Baptisme, and was full of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Ghost, and euen now in his exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of mortification, yet had the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
courage to set vpon him. There
is no place so holie, nor exercise so
good, as can represse his courage, or
giue a stay to the boldnesse of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
as we see <hi>Mark.</hi> 4. 14. The
word is no sooner sowen, but Sathan
comes immediately, and takes it out
of their hearts: which must needes
be done in the Church, for the word
is out, before they bee out of the
Church: so that hee is not afraide of
hearing the word, but can abide it wel
enough, yea, better than manie. And
though they carie the word out of the
Church, he will waite on them home,
and choake the word with cares, and
riches, and voluptuous liuing, like the
seede that fell among thornes, <hi>Luke</hi>
8. 14.</p>
               <p>And no more doth the care for the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:293:32"/>
exercise of prayer: for euen then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after the repetition of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes,
when wee haue made euen
with all the world, when GOD hath
forgiuen vs, and we others; then doth
the diuell giue vs occasion to say, <hi>Lead
vs not into temptation,</hi> as standing by
there readie to tempt vs.</p>
               <p>And as little cares he for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
for presently after they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
the Sacrament, and sang the
hymne, Christ tells them they shall al
be offended in him that night <hi>Mat.</hi>
26. 31. Thus we see his courage serues
him at all times, nothing is able to
quaile it.</p>
               <p>As this ought not to discourage the
children of God, hauing so faithful an
assistant to take their part: so it giueth
them this caueat, that they bee at no
time secure, but alwayes to keepe a
sure gard. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> in the midst
of a Sermon was sollicited to vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorie,
because he thought he pleased
his auditors and the thereupon brake off
his speech, and turned it to the diuell
<pb facs="tcp:293:33"/>
saying; <hi>Non propter te hoc opus coeptum
est; nec propter te, nec in te finitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as hee is couragious, so is hee
subtile: for notwithstanding his eager
desire, he staid the fittest time, wherin
consisteth a chiefe poynt of wisdome.
So when he tempted <hi>Eue,</hi> hee stayed
till her husband was away, and till he
could shew her the fruite, which was
so pleasing to the eye. So when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
lay with <hi>Bethsheba Vrias</hi> wife, hee
tempted him in the euening, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his sleepe, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 12. a verie fit
time for the purpose. So when they
were a sleepe, the enemy sowed tares,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>And as hee is warie in choosing his
time, so is he as cunning in choosing
the meanes, obseruing the dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men. For wanton and volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
men, he hath the daughters of
<hi>Moab,</hi> a bayte fit for their humours,
whereby to tempt them to idolatrie,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 1. For men secure and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
hee hath a net that suffiseth to
throwe ouer them, <hi>(2. Tim. 2. 26.)</hi> &amp;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:293:33"/>
snare them in. For others, that haue
more care to seeke and inquire into
things, he hath quills to blowe them
vp, as knowledge, which puffes vp, 1.
<hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1. Yea, euen the best things can
he make serue for his purpose, and to
be occasions of temptations; so that
hee may finde better entertainment,
for the good exercises sake that come
with him. He will come sometimes
shrowded in the necessity of nature, as
heere; for when a man is hungrie, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
requireth somwhat to asswage it.</p>
               <p>Prayer, no man doubteth to bee a
godly exercise: yet thereby he temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them that loued to pray in the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues,
and make much babbling,
and repetition, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 5. 7. In like
sort doth he abuse the name of good
counsell, as in <hi>Peter</hi> to Christ, <hi>Matt.</hi>
16. 22. who (as a frend) wished him to
spare himselfe, and liue out his time.</p>
               <p>Thus can he put on a faire shew, the
sooner to beguile: &amp; for good reason,
for if hee should come vnmasked in
his owne likenesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he would bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected;
<pb facs="tcp:293:34"/>
as if <hi>Iehoram</hi> the king of <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>
had come himselfe without <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaphat,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Kin. 3. 14</note>
                  <hi>Elisha</hi> would not haue looked

               <p>Now we are to consider the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
and order of the temptations, &amp;
then will we handle them particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And first wee are to note, that
though there are but these three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
yet he endured diuers others.
His whole life was full of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as may appeare by <hi>Luke,</hi> 22. 28.
It is said <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 2. that hee was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
fortie dayes of the diuell, whereas
these three Temptations heere set
downe, were not till after the ende of
fortie daies. These onely are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but there were other not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
as diuers of his miracles are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written,
<hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n 20. 25. Onely so much was
written, as was expedient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These three are a briefe abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all his Temptation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As it is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:293:34"/>
true that <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that Christ resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<hi>Adam,</hi> and was made a quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
spirite, as <hi>Adam</hi> was a liuing
soule, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 45. And the bringing
of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
by being called out of <hi>Egypt, Matt. 2.
15.</hi> So may Christ and <hi>Adam</hi> be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
in these three temptations. For
they both were tempted with concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence
of the flesh, concupiscence of
the eie, &amp; pride of life, 1. <hi>Io.</hi> 2. 16. In <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
the diuel first broght him into a
conceipt, that God enuied his good,
and of purpose kept him hood-win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
least he should see his good, as we
see Faulconers put hoods ouer hawks
eyes, to make them more quiet &amp; ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Secondly, he luls him on to a proud
conceipt of himselfe, by perswading
him, that by eating he should bee lyke
God. Thirdly he sheweth the fruite,
which was pleasant. So in Christs te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
first, hee would haue brought
him to murmur against God: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to presume: &amp; thirdly to commit
Idolatrie,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 5. 6. 7.</note> all which are set downe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:293:35"/>And vnder these three heads come all
temptations, <hi>Numb. 14. &amp;</hi> 21. and
<hi>Exod.</hi> 32.</p>
               <p>To some of these extreames will
the diuell seeke to driue one. First, by
distrust hee will seeke to driue vs to
vse vnlawfull meanes, for the obtayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of necessarie things, as bread is
when a man is hungrie. Or if we be
in no such want, that that temptation
cannot take place, then (through su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie)
he will tempt vs to wanton
and vnnecessarie desires, as to throwe
our selues down, that the Angels may
take vs vp: and hauing preuayled so
farre, then hee carieth vs to the diuell
and all. <hi>All this will I giue thee,</hi> there
is his <hi>All: Fall downe and worship me,</hi>
there is the Diuell with it: so (that in
this respect) may it well be sayd, that
<hi>The way of a Serpent is ouer a stone,
Prouerb.</hi> 30. 19. Hee goeth so slylie,
that a man seeth him in, before he can
tell what way, or how he got in. First
hee wrappes himselfe in necessitie,
and thereby wyndes himselfe in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceiued:
<pb facs="tcp:293:35"/>
then he brings vs to make
riches our God.</p>
               <p>Now let vs see his Darts. The
first is, of making stones bread. This
may well be called the hungrie temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
The streame of the Doctors,
make <hi>Adams</hi> offence the sinne of
gluttonie: but <hi>Bucer</hi> thinkes, that this
temptation is rather to be referred to
distrust and despaire. There is small
likelihood, that one should sinne in
gluttonie by eating bread onely. The
diuels desire was onely, that the stones
might be turned into bread, and that
after so long a Fast: and then if the
temptation had beene to Gluttonie,
Christs answere had been nothing to
the purpose; the Diuell might well
haue replyed against the insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of it. For gluttonie is to be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by a text willing sobrietie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
this text which Christ answereth
by, containeth rather an assertion of
Gods prouidence: and therefore our
Sauiour should haue seemed verie
<pb facs="tcp:293:36"/>
vnskilfull in defending himselfe. The
temptation therefore is to distrust.</p>
               <p>This standeth well with the diuels
cunning in fight: for by this he shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
first euen at the throate, and at
that which is the life of a Christian:
to wit his faith; as a man would say,
<hi>Iugulum petit,</hi> euen at that which ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
the world, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 5. Hee
tempted him to such a distrust, as was
in the <hi>Israelites, Exod.</hi> 17 7. when they
asked if God were with them or no.
So he made <hi>Adam</hi> think, God cared
not for him: so heere the diuell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth
a doubt to shake his faith,
wherein Christ made no doubt, <hi>Si fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Dei es.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed you heard a voyce say, you
were the beloued Sonne of God, but
are you so indeede? or was it not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a delusion? You see you are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
starued for want of bread: wel,
would God haue suffered you so to
be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if you had been his <hi>Filius dilectus?</hi>
No, you are some hunger-starued
childe. So <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 31. Christ prayed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:293:36"/>
that <hi>Peters</hi> faith might not faile. It
was that the diuell shot at. Hee is a
roaring Lyon seeking to deuoure vs,
whom wee must resist by faith, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi>
5. 8.</p>
               <p>It is our faith that hee aymes at, 1.
<hi>Thessal.</hi> 3. 5. For hauing overthrowne
that, disobedience soone will followe.
Hauing abolished the stablisher of
the Law, <hi>Roman.</hi> 3. 31. the breach of
the Lawe must needes follow. Hee
hath then fit time to set vs a worke, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
making stones into bread, that
is, to get our liuing by vnlawfull
meanes. First, shipwracke of faith,
then of obedience.</p>
               <p>The Diuell heere seeing him in
great want and hunger, woulde
thereby bring in doubt, that he was
not the Sonne of GOD, which is
not a good argument. For whether
wee respect the naturall tokens of
Gods fauour, wee see they happen
not to the wisest and men of best
and greatest knowledge, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in the ninth <hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>Eccl. vers.</hi> 11.
<pb facs="tcp:293:37"/>
or the supernaturall fauour of GOD,
we shall see <hi>Abraham</hi> forced to flye
his Countrey into <hi>Egypt</hi> for famine,
<hi>Gen,</hi> 10. 12. so did <hi>Isaack, Gen.</hi> 26. 1. &amp;
<hi>Iacob</hi> likewise was in the same distres,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 43. 1. Notwithstanding that God
was called <hi>The God of Abraham, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saack
and Iacob;</hi> yet were they all three
like to be hunger-starued. Yea, not
only so, but for their faith, manie were
burned and stoned, <hi>of whom the world
was not worthie, Hebr.</hi> 11. 37. So fared
it with the Apostles, they were hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie,
naked, and a thirst, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 11.
But what doo we speake of the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
sonnes of God, when as his owne
naturall Sonne suffered as much, nay,
fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e more? Heere we see he was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie, also hee was wearied with tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and faine to rest: <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4. 6. hee
had no house to hide his head in,
whereas foxes haue holes.</p>
               <p>If thou be the Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>The heathens haue obserued, that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:293:37"/>
in Rethoricke it is a poynt of chiefest
cunning, when you would out-face a
man, or importune him to do a thing,
to presse &amp; vrge him with that, which
he will not, or cannot for shame denie
to be in himselfe: as by saying; If you
haue anie wit, then you will doo thus
and thus: if you be an honest man or
a good fellow, doo this. So heere the
diuell (not being to learne anie poynt
of subtiltie) comes to our Sauiour,
saying, <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God,</hi> (as
it may be doubted, you beeing in this
case) then, <hi>make these stones bread.</hi> No,
no, it followes not: a man may be the
sonne of God, and not shew it by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
such arte. So when <hi>Pilate</hi> asked,
who accused Christ? they answered,
<hi>If hee had not been a malefactor, wee
would not haue brought him before thee,
Iohn</hi> 18. 30. They were iolly graue
men, it was a flat flatterie: and in <hi>Ioh.</hi>
21. 23. there is the like. This ought
to put vs in minde, when we are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in like manner, that we take heed
we be not out-faced.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:293:38"/>In the matter it selfe we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
these poynts: First the diuel sets
it downe for a ground, that (followe
what will) bread must needes bee
had.</p>
               <p>Therefore Christ first closeth with
him, Admit he had bread, were hee
then safe? No, <hi>We liue not by bread on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi>
so that bread is not of absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie.
Well, what followes of that?
Bread you must needes haue, you see
your want, God hath left off to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
for you. Then comes the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
Therefore shift for your selfe as
well as you can. First he solliciteth vs
to a mutinous repining within our
selues,
as <hi>Hebr. 3. 8. Harden not your
hearts, as in the day of temptation, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
whereby he forceth vs to breake out
into such like conceipts, as <hi>Psalm. 116.
11. I sayd in my distresse, that all men
be lyars:</hi> and <hi>Psalm. 31. 22. I said in my
hast, I am cast off.</hi> Thus closely he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strusted
God, in saying, his Prophets
prophecie lyes, till at last, we euen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:293:38"/>
our mouths against God himself,
and say, <hi>This euill commeth from the
Lord, shal I attend on the Lord any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?</hi>
2. Booke of Kings, chapter 6. and
verse 33. Hunger and shame is all
wee shall get at Gods hands. And
so hauing cast off God, betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to some other Patrone, &amp; then
the diuell is fittest for their turne. For
when we are fallen out with one, it is
best seruing his enemie, and to retaine
to the contrary faction. Then we seek
a familiar (with <hi>Saule</hi>) to answere vs,
1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 7.</p>
               <p>But what did the diuel than tel him?
did he bring comfort with him? No,
he tells him, that to morrow he &amp; his
sonnes should dye. So heere dooth
the Diuell bring a stone with him.
<hi>What Father</hi> (sayeth Christ) <hi>if his
Sonne aske him bread, would giue
him a stone? Matthew</hi> the seauenth
chapter and in the ninth verse: yet
the Diuell doth so; Christ was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grye,
and the Diuell showes him
stones.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:293:39"/>Heere is the Diuels comfort, here
bee stones for thee, if thou canst de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
anie waye to make these stones
bread, thou art well; whereas we doo
not vse to make bread of stones, but
of wheate, to worke it with the sweate
of our browes. To get it so, we learne
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
               <p>By extortion and vsurie wee may
make stones into bread, that is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
Alchymistrie: or happily we may
make bread of nothing, when a man
gets a thing by anothers ouersight,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 43. 12. Or els, what and if wee
can ouer-reach our brother in subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and goe beyond him with a tricke
of wit or cunning? <hi>Let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud
or oppresse his brother in anie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
for the Lord is auenged of all such,
1. Thessal.</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. The one is called <hi>The
bread of violence and oppression, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbs</hi> 4. 17.
The other, <hi>The bread of

               </p>
               <p>They are indeede both made of

For though in the beginning
such bread be pleasant, <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 20. 17.

that <hi>Elisha</hi> (2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 6.

of the traynes layd for
him, when they lay in
Ambush agaynst him. And euen
this is the first vse that wee haue
of our Sauiours Temptations.</p>
            <p>It warnes vs afore-hand of the

diuels comming, so that we may haue
time to prepare our selues according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
For as at that time the diuel came
vppon Christ when hunger pinched
him: so where we are in any distres,
wee are to looke for temptations.</p>
            <p>This temptation hath two parts.
First comes <hi>(Si)</hi> a distrust: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
followes vnlawfull meanes. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
laid this foundation, that bread
is necessarie to bee had when one is
hungrie, he inferreth, that God help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not, nor supplieth thy want:
therefore God is not thy Father, <hi>Mat.</hi>
7. 9. and therefore depend no longer
on him, but shift for your selfe. This
is the effect of the diuells argument.</p>
            <p>The Fathers vpon the words <hi>Eph.</hi>
6. 16. <hi>(Take the shield of faith, to quench
all the fierie dartes of the Diuell:)</hi> doo
note, that about euery one of the darts
or temptations of the diuell, there are
(as it were) balls of wylde fire. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to assault our obedience, &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that faith is our shield: to that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:293:41"/>
end he vseth the arrow-head, which
is distrust in God; about which is
fire, to wit, the vsing of vnlawfull
meanes, to consume our obedience,
which will consume our shielde of
faith, and so make way for the dart to
kill or wound vs. So that his drift is,
to bring our adoption or Son-ship to
a <hi>Si.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no doubt, but Christ was
able to haue turned stones into bread:
but why would he not then folow the
diuels aduice? The diuell by saying,
<hi>Say vnto these stones,</hi> seemeth to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that hee had the force to
haue done it, euen by his bare word:
for euen stones are said to heare the
voyce of God, and to obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement;
and not onely Gods,
but euen Gods seruants, as 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 13.
5. when the man of GOD had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
that the aulter should rent
in sunder, it did so. And <hi>Matt.</hi> 27.
51. when Iesus cryed out with a lowde
voyce, the vayle of the Temple rent
in twaine, the earth did quake, and the
<pb facs="tcp:293:42"/>
stones were clouen. The dead men
are worse than stones, yet they in
their graues heard his voyce.</p>
            <p>And not onely was he able to turne
stones into bread, but into men also,
as Children to <hi>Abraham</hi> of stones,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 9. If therefore it had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him, hee was as well able at this
time to haue turned stones into
bread, as after hee turned water into
wine, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 10.</p>
            <p>It was no lesse possible to him (no
doubt) to haue saued himselfe, when
the <hi>Iewes</hi> scoffingly bad him, <hi>Matt.</hi>
27. 42. as to haue saued others; and to
haue come downe from the Crosse
being aliue; as it was after for him, not
onely beeing dead and buried, but a
great stone beeing ouer him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue
it, and come out of the graue,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 2. Hee had power to both,
but not will alike to both.</p>
            <p>But why would he not here vse
his power, for the satisfying of his
hunger, and followe the diuells ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:293:42"/>In setting downe the Historie of
turning water into wine, it is thus far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
said, that he did it, <hi>that his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
might beleeue in him, Iohn</hi> 2. 11.</p>
            <p>That was the reason that moued him
to the working of that myracle: and
because there was no such cause here,
hee did it not. For the Diuell would
not beleeue in him (he knew) though
hee had done it. The Diuell desired
him, but to haue him shew what hee
could doo, for a neede onely, for a
vaunt of his power. Wherein wee
see the humour of pride, that made
him at the first to fall.</p>
            <p>It is the same temptation that his
kinsfolkes vsed, <hi>No man dooth anie
thing secretly, that seeketh to bee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous:
if thou doost these things, shewe
thy selfe to the world.</hi> But see how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly
the Temptation hangeth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
He should rather haue said, <hi>If
you be hungrie;</hi> than <hi>If you be the sonne
of God:</hi> and then rather haue bid him
fast fortie dayes more, than turne the
stones into bread.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:293:43"/>If it had been to haue made a Sonne
of God, Christ would haue done it:
but not to haue shewed himself to be
the Sonne of God.</p>
            <p>But it may be asked, why did Christ
vouchsafe to giue him anie answere at
all; whereas hee might haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
him to silence, and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him before his time, and haue pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
him for his sawcines? When
<hi>Peter</hi> te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted him, he cut him vp verie
sharply, saying; <hi>Come behinde me Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
Mark.</hi> 8. 33. Why did hee not
answere the diuel so? He might haue
enioyned him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and throwne him into
the bottomlesse pit, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 31. or at
the least bidden him, <hi>Auoyde Sathan,
vers.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augustine</hi> answereth this doubt,
that Christ answered in the like time,
to teach vs to aunswere: willing vs
thereby (as <hi>Abimelech</hi> did his souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers)
to doo as hee had doone before,
<hi>Iudg.</hi> 9. 48. So Christ is our example,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 15. and bids vs doo as he hath
done. Christ is our Captaine, he hath
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:293:43"/>
gone before vs, and shewed vs how to
behaue our selues in fight: when the
diuell assaulteth vs with distrust, then
are we to ward it off with a Text of
Gods prouidence; and so of the rest,
as he hath done before vs.</p>
            <p>Our Sauiours shield, whereby (we
see) he beareth off all the diuels darts,
is couered all ouer with <hi>Scriptum est.</hi>
Wee haue here a briefe viewe of the
Churches armorie, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 4. of the
Tower of <hi>Dauid,</hi> built for defence.
Here be the shields wherewith <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
Temple was hanged, and which
<hi>Paule</hi> calleth <hi>The weapons of our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,</hi>
2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. not carnall, but migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
(through GOD) to cast downe
holds.</p>
            <p>They are in number fiue. First, a
preparation of our selues by the vse
of Gods Sacraments, that we may be
the more strong to sustaine and beare
off temptations, and to holde out to
the ende without fainting. Secondly,
a withdrawing our selues into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
or some other solitary place, there
<pb facs="tcp:293:44"/>
(by Meditation) to kindle good
thoughts, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 39. 3. Thirdly, fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Fourthly, watchfull prayer, <hi>Mat.</hi>
26. 41. Fiftly, the perfecting of our
selues in the Scriptures. These be the
fiue shields wherewith <hi>Salomons</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was hanged.</p>
            <p>Now as for the Scripture, we are to
note, that where God speaketh of any
good that we are to receiue out of it,
it is reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended to vs as a storehouse,
whether we are to make our resort for
the bread of life, and the water of life,
<hi>whereof he that tasteth, shal neuer thirst.
Ioh.</hi> 6. 35. And from thence are we to
draw the waters of comfort, out of the
fountains of saluation, <hi>Esa,</hi> 12. 3. When
there is anie ill spoken of, which wee
are to resist, then is it commended to
vs as an Armorie, whence wee may
fetch anie kinde of weapon which we
shal need, either offensiue, as a sword,
<hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. 12. or defensiue, as a shield,
<hi>Pro.</hi> 30. 5.</p>
            <p>The Scripture is the broad plate,
that is to beare off the darts: our faith
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:293:44"/>
is the braces or handle whereby wee
take hold, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 16. and lift it vp to
defend our selues withall. For the
Scripture is a shield <hi>Non quod dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
sed quod creditur. Dicitur;</hi> there
is the strong and broad matter, fit to
beare off: and <hi>Creditur,</hi> that is the
handle or braces to it. <hi>God spake once
or twice, I haue heard it, power belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vnto God. Psalm.</hi> 62. 11. So that it
suffiseth not that it bee spoken onely
by God, but we must heare it too: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
must we heare it as the voice of a
man, (as <hi>Samuel</hi> at the first did; who
when God called him, thought it the
voice of <hi>Eli)</hi> but as the voice of God,
that we which were dead in our sins,
vs hath he quickned &amp; forgiuen vs al
our trespasses, 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 13. This is the
perfection of our faith.</p>
            <p>Generally of the scriptures, this is
Christs opinion, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by his own
practise; that if the diuell come as a
serpent, here is a charm for him, <hi>Ps.</hi> 58.
5. or if he come as a lion, here is that is
able to preuaile against him, 1. <hi>Pe.</hi> 5. 8.
<pb facs="tcp:293:45"/>
And that the Diuell knowes well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
as appeareth by his mallice
that he hath alwayes borne it, before
it was scripture, when it was but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Dictum.</hi> For so soone as God had
said, Let <hi>vs make man in our likenes,</hi> that
word was straight a whetstone to the
diuells enuie. And after the fall, when
the seede was promised, that was, and
is the cause of all the diuells enmitie,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. So when the promise was
reitterated, <hi>Genes.</hi> 22. 18. that was the
cause hee so turmoyled all the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs.</p>
            <p>But when the words was to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and to become Scripture, then his
malice began to grow verie hot, in so
much that he caused it for anger to be
broken, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 19. For the Fathers
are of opinion, that all the diuels bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
endeuour, in making the <hi>Israelites</hi>
to commit idolatrie with the golden
Calfe, was to the ende, that he might
so heate <hi>Moses</hi> in his <hi>zeale,</hi> as that in
his anger hee should breake the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of the Law, by casting them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stely
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:293:45"/>
out of his hands. We are to note
therefore, that there is a forceable
sound in the word, which the Diuell
cannot abide; &amp; not onely the sound,
but the sight also.</p>
            <p>It is written of <hi>Augustine,</hi> that ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sicke on his bed, he caused the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
poenitentiall Psalmes to be pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on the wall ouer against him, in
great letters; that if after hee should
become speechles, yet he might point
to euerie verse when the diuell came
to tempt him; and so confute him.
<hi>Blessed is hee that hath his quiuer full of
such arrowes, they shall not bee ashamed.</hi>
Blessed is hee that hath the skill to
choose out fit arrowes for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
as the Fathers speake out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,</hi>
49. 2.</p>
            <p>Christ saith affirmatiuely of the
Scriptures, that <hi>in them is eternall life,
Iohn</hi> 5. 39. negatiuely, that the cause of
error, is the not knowing of them,
<hi>Mark.</hi> 12. 24. Dauid saith, it was
that that made him wiser than his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb facs="tcp:293:46"/>
than his teachers, and than the
Auncients, <hi>Psalm. 119. 98. 99. &amp;</hi> 110.
Knowledge of the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the way to
amendment after a fall, 2. <hi>Timot.</hi> 2. 26.
There is much calling now a daies for
the word, and others finde fault as
fast, that it is no better harkened vnto:
for as the want of obedience and al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
abuses (which are so much cried
out against) proceede not onely from
the not hearing of the word, but as
well from the not mingling of faith
with it, (without which mixture, it is
nothing worth) it profiteth not, <hi>Heb.</hi>
4. 2. so the error of the former times
was, in yeelding too farre to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
policie, by sealing vp the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and locking the storehouse and
armorie of the people.</p>
            <p>It is the policie Christ tells vs of
in the eleuenth chapter of Saint <hi>Lukes</hi>
Gospell, the two and twentieth verse.
A strong man puts the strong armed
man out of his house, and takes away
his armour from him: then hee needs
not feare him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:293:46"/>The like policie we read of 1. <hi>Sam.</hi>
13. 19. when the <hi>Philistines</hi> had taken
away all smythes and armour, then
they thought they were safe. So in
the time of darkenesse, the Diuell
might let them doo their good works,
and what they list, and yet haue them
still vnder his lure: for hee might of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
them at his pleasure, that had no
armour to resist him.</p>
            <p>All the Children of GOD, had
a right and propertie in the Lawe of
God, as appeareth by Christs words,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 34. hee answered them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in your law?</hi> As though he should
say, the Scripture is yours.</p>
            <p>To the young man (in the tenth
Chapter of Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> Gospell, and
twentie sixe verse) that asked Christ
what he should do to be saued? Christ
answereth, What is written in the
Law? how readest thou? Whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
to answere, that we cannot read,
or that the booke is sealed vp, <hi>Esay</hi>
29. 11. is as the diuell would haue it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:293:47"/>Then hath hee a fit time to offer vs
stones to make bread of. But this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
with our Sauiour Christ wil not
be allowed of.</p>
            <p>Now come we to the speciall point
of Christs answere, <hi>It is written, Man
liues not by bread onely, &amp;c. Deut.</hi> 8. 3.</p>
            <p>There is no better kinde of reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
than that, when one graunts all
that hath been said by his aduersarie,
and prooueth it to make on his part;
and vpon a new conceipt, auoyds all
that his aduersarie said. Here our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
might confesse all that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
obiected; as that he is the sonne
of God: and admit the stones were
made bread, and that bread were of
absolute necessitie, and that it were so
to be come by (which is vntrue,) were
we then in good case?</p>
            <p>This indeede is the diuels position,
wherewith hee would perswade all
those that haue <hi>animam triticeam,</hi> (as
the Fathers call it) that those exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
things are necessarie to be had:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:293:47"/>
and that if they haue enough thereof,
they are wel enough; as we see it to be
the minde of the rich man, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.
19. This man hauing a wheaten soule,
hauing corne enough, bad his soule
take rest, and liue merily for manie
yeares. But Christ goeth further, and
saith; Though the stones bee made
bread, it will not auayle, except it
please GOD (by the blessing of his
word) to giue vertue, and (as it were)
life vnto the bread, there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene it and a stone.</p>
            <p>It is not the plentie or qualitie of
victuals, howsoeuer some doate vpon
such external meanes, as they did,
which sacrificed to their net, &amp; burnt
incense to their yarne, <hi>Abac.</hi> 1. 16. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
by them their portion was fat,
and their meates plenteous. For what
saith <hi>Iob cap. 31. ver. 27. If I reioyced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
my substance was great, this had
been an iniquity.</hi> So that our life is not
maintained by bread onely, descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
out of the mould of the earth.</p>
            <p>The nature of bread &amp; stones are not
<pb facs="tcp:293:48"/>
much vnlike, they come both out of
one belly: that is to say, the earth. <hi>Iob</hi>
28. 5. 6. and of themselues, the one of
them hath no more power than the
other vnto life: for wee know that the
<hi>Israelites</hi> died, euen while the flesh of
Quayles was in their mouthes, <hi>Num.</hi>
11. 33. &amp; <hi>Manna</hi> (heauenly fare) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
far better than our bread. It is the
diuels craftie policie, to burie a mans
life vnder a loafe of bread: and (as it
were) to fetter the grace of God to the
outward meanes; whereas they of
themselues are of no more efficacie,
without the operation and grace of
the word, than a hammer and a sawe,
without a hand able to imploy them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dauid</hi> saith (<hi>Psalm. 104. 28.) The
eyes of all things waite on God for theyr
meate in due season, &amp; thou fillest them:</hi>
With what? with bread? No<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
<hi>with thy blessing and goodnesse.</hi> Our
hearts must be stablished with grace,
not with meates. <hi>Hebr. cap. 13. verse</hi> 9.
It is Gods prerogatiue, that as all
things had theyr beginnings from
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:293:48"/>
him, <hi>Coloss. cap. 1. vers.</hi> 17. so hee sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
and sustaineth them, <hi>Hebr.
cap. 1. ver.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>This is a further point than all phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie
teacheth vs. For they hauing
layd downe the foure elements, bare
and simple essencies, <hi>tanquam materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi>
by compounding or tempring of
them, they bring foorth a certayne
quintessence or balme full of vertue.
But Diuinitie leadeth vs to a quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
without which, all the quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences
and balmes in the world can
doo vs no good.</p>
            <p>To the question that <hi>Ieremie</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth,
<hi>Is there no balme at Gilead?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ierem. 8. 22</note>
               <hi>Is there no Phisitian there?</hi> The aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
may be, Mans health is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
by balme or phisicke onely,
<hi>but by euerie word that proceedeth out
of the mouth of</hi> GOD, if wee weigh
Christs argument aright: for we may
see 2. <hi>Chron. 16. 12. Asa dyed</hi> for all
his Phisitians that were about him. So
if it be asked, Are there no horses nor
chariots in <hi>Cilead?</hi> we may answere,
<pb facs="tcp:293:49"/>
warlike victory consisteth not in war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
furniture onely, but in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
the name of our Lord GOD.
<hi>Psalm.</hi> 20. 7. A horse is a vaine thing
to saue, without the power of this
word. And so when a man thriues not
or prospers not in his actions; it is
not often for want of labour or care:
<hi>Psalm.</hi> 127. 1. tells him, <hi>Except the Lord
build the house, &amp;c. Augustine</hi> aduiseth
his Auditorie, to beleeue it in time,
least (by wofull experience) they find
it to be true, when as they shall haue
such a consumption, that no meate
shall doo them anie good; or such a
dropsie, that no drinke shall auayle
them.</p>
            <p>The power and vertue of this word
is called, <hi>The staffe of bread, Leuit.</hi> 26.
26. and it is meant of a chiefe staffe,
such a one as is set in the middest, to
beare vp all the Tent.</p>
            <p>The plainest similitude I can vse, to
make you vnderstand the force there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
is this: When we goe to Phisicke
for anie disease, we are bidden seethe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:293:49"/>
such hearbs in running water, &amp; then
to drinke the water; we know it is not
the water which helpeth, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
of infusion. So it is not the
bread (considered barely in it selfe)
that nourisheth vs, but the vertue and
grace of the word infused into it. We
are not therefore to sticke to the
meanes, like the Glutton, <hi>Luc.</hi> 12. 19.
but to pray for this blessing.</p>
            <p>And to this end, God (in the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
of nature) hath thereout re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
foure speaciall prerogatiues to
his word.</p>
            <p>As first, with a verie little of the
meanes, to goe farre in operation, 1.
<hi>Reg.</hi> 17. 14. with a little oyle and a little
wheate, he fed <hi>Elias,</hi> the poore wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and her sonne a great while; &amp;
<hi>Matt.</hi> 17. 14. Christ made fiue loaues
and two fishes serue fiue thousand.
The heathen man thought no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
proportion was to be set down
for a familie, because when a heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hunger commeth on men, they eate
<pb facs="tcp:293:50"/>
more at one time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than at another. But
whatsoeuer the heathen haue spoken
wisely, we haue farre more wisely vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
by the holy Ghost, in one place
or other. In <hi>Psalm.</hi> 17. 14. this is set
downe, where there is mention made
of a certaine hidden treasure, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
mens bellyes be filled, and <hi>Agg.</hi>
1. 6. saith, <hi>Men eate much, yet haue not
enough; dri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ke much, but are not filled.</hi>
This is the First p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erogatiue.</p>
            <p>His second is, he takes order as wel
for the qualitie, as for the quantitie;
course meates and fine are al one with
him; for the <hi>Israelites</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Quayles and Manna, dyed:
and <hi>Daniel</hi> and his fellowes, that fed
vppon course meates, looked better
than all the Children that were fed
with the Kings owne dyet, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. 15.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, without meanes he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
somet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mes. Therefore <hi>Asa</hi> had
said little or nothing to the purpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e,
2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. 11. if hee had said, <hi>God
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:293:50"/>
helpeth by manie or by few:</hi> if hee had
not put in too, <hi>and sometimes by none.</hi>
For there was light before anie Sunne
or Moone, <hi>Genes.</hi> 1. 3. though after
(<hi>verse</hi> 14.) it pleased God to ordaine
them as instruments. And so <hi>Genes.</hi>
2. 5. the Earth was fertile, when as
then no rayne had falne on the Earth,
nor anie such ordinarye meanes.
Let <hi>Moses</hi> be on the Mount, and
but heare GOD, and he needeth no
bread.</p>
            <p>The fourth is, that he can bring his
purpose to passe, euen by those means
whose natures tend to contrarie ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;
as, to preserue by stones.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Colloquintida,</hi> beeing ranke poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
(in eating whereof is present
death) was (by the Prophet) made
matter of nourishment, 2. Booke of
Kings fourth chapter &amp; fort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th verse.
So Christ, by those things which were
fit to put out a seeing mans eyes, as
dust; made a blinde man recouer his
sight, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:293:51"/>And so doth hee make light to shyne
out of darknesse, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
out of another. Thus wee see
the diuell answered. Now let vs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
these things to our selues.</p>
            <p>Christs aunswere doth import two
words, and so two mouthes, and two
breaths, or spirites: and these two bee
as two twinnes. He that will be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the one, must seek after the
other. The first word is the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
whereby the course of nature is
established, according to <hi>Psalm.</hi> 147.
15. <hi>He sendeth foorth his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vpon the earth, and his word run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
verie swiftly: he giueth snow lyke
wool, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the other is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>Iames cap. 1. vers.</hi> 18. speaketh: to
wit, the word of truth, wherewith (of
his owne will) he begat vs. The one
proceedeth from the mouth of Gods
prouidence, creating and gouerning
all things, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 33. 6. hee but speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the word, and it was done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:293:51"/>The other proceedeth out of the
mouth of Gods Prophets, who are
(as it were) his mouth, <hi>Ier. 15. 19. Thou
standest before mee, as if thou wert my
mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the first word, al things haue
their beginning and beeing; as when
he sent forth his spirite or breath, they
were created &amp; had their beginning:
So <hi>Psalm.</hi> 104. 29. he teacheth vs, that
so soone as God hides his face, they
are troubled. And if he takes away
their breath, they dye, and returne to
dust.</p>
            <p>The other spirite, that is, the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
Spirite, ministreth vnto vs su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
life, <hi>Esay</hi> 59. 21. Now
therefore to set them together, euery
man is thus to thinke with himselfe.</p>
            <p>If I get my liuing contrary to Gods
word, that is, by any vnlawful meanes;
surely Gods other word will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie
such gotten goods. That is,
these two words bee twinnes: if wee
<pb facs="tcp:293:52"/>
get not our goods by the one woord,
we shal want the blessing of the other
word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then we were as good eate
stones: it will bee but grauell in our
mouthes, or quailes. We are then to
vse the meanes, according to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> (wee see) went foorth to
sacrifice, according to Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Genes.</hi> 22. the Word was his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:
therefore when <hi>Isaac</hi> asked
where was the Sacrifice? hee might
boldly answere, God would prouide
one; as we see euen at the verie pinch
he did: whereupon it came to bee a
prouerbe, that euen <hi>In monte, Iehoua
prouide bit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Israelites</hi> went out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> by
the warrant and appoyntment of
Gods Word. How then? First, they
had a way made them (where neuer
was anie before) through the Red-sea,
<hi>Exod. cap. 14. vers. 21.</hi> they had bread
downwards out of the clowdes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it vseth to rise vpwards out of the
earth: their garments in fortie yeares
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:293:52"/>
neuer waxed olde, <hi>Deuteron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the eight
chapter, third and fourth verses: they
had water whence water vseth not to
come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by striking the Rockes, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
gushed forth:<note place="margin">Num. 20. 11.</note> so that it is true
which the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> saith in
the ninth verse of the foure and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
Psalme, <hi>There is no want to them
that feare God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though GOD (peraduenture)
will not vse the same meanes hee
did for the <hi>Israelites;</hi> yet the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of GOD (walking after his
will) shall haue some way of reliefe
a wayes.</p>
            <p>And therefore Christ would not
distrust the prouidence of GOD:
for hee knew hee was in the worke
and waye of GOD. For we read,
that hee was led into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
by the Spirite, and therefore
could not lacke; as indeede he did
not, for the Angells came and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
vnto him: as it followeth in the eleuenth verse of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:293:53"/>So either the Crowes shal minister to
our wants, as they did to <hi>Elias:</hi> or
our enemies, as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did to
the <hi>Israelites:</hi> or els the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
as they did here.</p>
            <p>But to grow to a conclusion, Let vs
seeke the Kingdome of God, and all
other things shall be ministred vnto
vs. And in all like temptations, wee
may learne a good aunswere out of
<hi>Dan. cap. 3. vers. 17. That God that we
serue is able to releeue &amp; deliuer vs, euen
from the burning fire:</hi> But if it should
not be his will so to doo, yet wee will
not vse vnlawfull meanes, or fall to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie,
or turne stones into bread.</p>
            <p>In this aunswere (againe) Christ
would teach vs heere to bee resolute,
howsoeuer Gods blessing dooth not
concurre with our gettings, as it doth
not when wee get them by indirect
meanes, contrarie to God word. To
goods so gotten, God will adde sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row:
for <hi>The blessing of the Lord ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
rich, and he doth adde no sorrowes
with it. Prouerb.</hi> 10. 22. When GOD
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:293:53"/>
giues riches, he giues quietnes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
but if God giue them not, wee
were as good be without them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they bee gotten by oppression or
violence, <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 4. 17. or by fraud &amp;
deceipt, <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 20. 17. For these two
be the quick-siluer and brimstone of
the Diuells Alchymistrie. God will
adde sorrowe to them: for though
they be pleasant at the first, <hi>Prouerb.</hi>
20. 17. and money gotten by stinking
meanes, smels like other money (as an
Emperour said): and bread so gotten,
taste like other bread: yet in the end
a plaine conclusion and experiment
will make it manifest, that it was made
of stones, and had sorrow mingled or
added to it. And therefore it shall be
either an occasion or matter of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
called the <hi>Stone</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they shall finde such a grudging
and torment in their conscience, that
they will wish that they had starued

suffer them to die in their beds,
without anie remorse of conscience,
like blockes, or like an Oxe dying in a

as throw our selues into anie danger,
and he will not forsake vs: by the one
he puts vs in feare (as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith)
<hi>Deum defuturum, et iamsi promisit;</hi> by
the other, in hope <hi>Deum adfuturum,
vbi non promisit:</hi> by the one, he slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
GOD vnto vs, as if hee were a
God of straw, of base condition, and
subiect to our becke; by the other, as
if he were a God of yron, that would
not encline, though wee requested
him.</p>
            <p>Now to the Temptation: wherein
we are to consider three things. First,
the g<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound the Diuell chose for the
woorking of this Temptation. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
<pb facs="tcp:293:57"/>
the temptation it selfe; to wit,
the diuells speech. Thirdly, Christs
answere to it.</p>
            <p>In the place, three things are to be
noted: first, the place it self: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the diuel chose it: thirdly, that our
Sauiour followed him thether.</p>
            <p>For a new Temptation hee makes
choyce of a new place. Indeed for a
temptation to presumption, the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes
was not a sit place: first it was
not high enough, and then it was not
populous enough. It was a melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
place: when a man is vnder the
crosse in affliction, or in some anguish
and sorrow for want, death of frends,
or otherwise; and generally for all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie
men: the hungrie temptation
is fitter, than this of presumption.</p>
            <p>As long as <hi>Noah</hi> was in the Arke
in the midst of the waters, hee had in
him no presumptuous thought: but
sitting vnder the vine in his vineyard,
he was ouercome therewith. And iust
<hi>Lot (2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>et.</hi> 2. 8.) in <hi>Sodome,</hi> had no fit
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:293:57"/>
time or place to bee presumptuous;
but when he dwelt in the mountaine
in securitie, then he committed incest
with his Daughters, beeing made
drunke by them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dauid,</hi> so long as hee was persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Saule,</hi> and tossed vp &amp; downe
from post to piller, had no leasure to
be presumptuous: but in the top of
his turret, when he was at rest in his
pallace, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 2. presumption
gaue him a blow. So heere the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes
was no fit place, but the Pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
is a very fit place for one to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
on. It is as good as a stage
to shew himselfe vpon, to see and to
be seene.</p>
            <p>In the Wildernes there was small
warrant for one that would bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous:
but from the Pinacle hee
might discerne farre and neere, both
the inner Court and outward Court,
and see a whole Clowde of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
and haue some warrant of
example of all estates, high or lowe,
wise or noble.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:293:58"/>For what abuse soeuer be in him, bee
he neuer so presumptuous, hee shall
see some as prowde, stout, and high
minded as himselfe: be his hayre ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so long, or his ruffs neuer so great,
he shall finde some as farre gone ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
as himselfe.</p>
            <p>If wee marke the foure gradations
that it hath, wee shall finde it to bee a
verie fit place. As first, before hee
could come to the Pinacle, hee must
goe out of the Wildernesse into the
Citie: secondly, not anie Citie, but
the holy Citie: thirdly, into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Citie: and fourthly, out of
the Temple vp to the Pinacle.</p>
            <p>First, (hauing got him to leaue the
Wildernes) hee brought him into the
Citie, that there hee might saye vnto
him: you see such &amp; such graue men,
how they behaue themselues: why
should you seeke to bee holier than
they? This was a good ciuill temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
hee brought him not to <hi>Cesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea</hi>
or <hi>Samaria,</hi> but euen to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:293:58"/>
the holie Citie: for that addition is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
it, <hi>Luc<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he brought him into the Temple,
where euen the verie ground was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Fourthly, not to anie other place
of it, but to the verie top and pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
which was ouer the <hi>Sanctum San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who would not tread hard there?
and take vpon him being in such a
place, where if a man will be carried
away with example; hee may see <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias</hi>
the high Priest, renting his
cloathes, at the hearing of things that
sounded like blasphemie, <hi>Mark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 14.
63. and yet buying his Bishoprick for
money; who will not then be bold to
doo the like? And <hi>Herod</hi> a Prince,
such a one as heard <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi>
preach; yea, and with much delight,
to commit adulterie, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6. 20 who
would feare to doo the like? There
he may see the Pharisie, vnder showe
of great holines, tything mynt and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
and vnder colour of long prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
deuoure widowes houses, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:293:59"/>
in by extortion, and sending out
by excesse, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 14. 21.</p>
            <p>And so in this Citie, one may see
some men, both great frequenters of
Sermons, and yet great vsurers; gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen
misshapen in theyr attyre.
Seeing this, who will not be as bolde
as they, the place being so holie? And
beeing thus warranted by example,
surely we must needs commend the
diuels wit, for his choyce.</p>
            <p>Out of this arise two notes.</p>
            <p>First against some phantasticall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
who say, Can that bee an holie
Citie, where there be dumbe dogges?
There were so in <hi>Ierusalem, Es<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 56. 10.</hi>
where the leaders be blinde, <hi>Matth.
15. 14.</hi> They were so where <hi>Iudas</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
the Sacrament, where there is
diuision and debate amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 2. Can this (say they)
be the holie Citie? And thereuppon
they forsake the fellowship, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.
25. whereas they (notwithstanding
the former abuses, and notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:293:59"/>
the eleuen Tribes were Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stataes)
did yet name it the holie
Citie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, on the other side wee are
to be instructed, that though a man
be on the battlements of the Church,
yet hath he no sure footing, or cause
to be secure; but rather to feare the
more: for euen there doth the diuell
stand at his elbow, watching his ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.
There is no place (we see) pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledged
from temptations, no Desert
so sollitarie, but the diuell will seeke it
out: no pinacle so high, but the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
is a Bishop ouer it, to visit and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlooke
it.</p>
            <p>To conclude, though in <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
sit the abhomination of desolation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
(whereof <hi>Daniel</hi> spake) yet it is the
holy Citie stil. And though the place
bee neuer so holy, yet is that no cause
of priuiledge; but euen there may sit
the abhomination of desolation Both
are prooued out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 15.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:293:60"/>The second thing that wee obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in the circumstaunce of place, is,
that the Diuell assumpted Christ:
which, to those that are weake (as
<hi>Gregorie</hi> also collecteth) may be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue,
in giuing them to thinke, that
the Diuell had such power ouer
Christ as to carie him whether he list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But when they shall consider, that
euen the lymbes of the Diuell haled
and harrowed him too and fro, from
<hi>Annas</hi> to <hi>Caiphas,</hi> from <hi>Caiphas</hi> to <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi>
from <hi>Pilate</hi> to <hi>Herod,</hi> and from
him backe againe to <hi>Pilate:</hi> and how
spitefully and contemptuously he was
vsed in all these places, and at last ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to execution: what meruayle
wil it be to see him (as <hi>Augustin</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth)
<hi>In monte duci a capite, qui a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris
traditur, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things doo indeed (as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his sufferings) set forth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the loue of GOD towards vs.
Of God the Father, that would giue
his onely Sonne; yea, appoint him
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:293:60"/>
this worke of our saluation, and giue
the Diuell such a power ouer him,
<hi>Luc.</hi> 20. 53. Of God the Sonne, that he
would bee content to suffer such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7. as to be obedient to
the death of the Crosse.</p>
            <p>The reason of all these his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
as also that he would bee bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
of <hi>Iohn,</hi> a weake and sinfull man;
was (as himselfe declareth it) to fulfil
all righteousnes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 15. So heere
he was to suffer it, els Gods righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
would not haue been fulfilled, nor
the worke of our saluation. And as
he suffered this Assumption, so after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<hi>Luk. 9. 51.</hi> his second Assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
was to goe to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to suffer;
and so at the last he came to his third
and last Assumption, to be receiued
vp into glorie, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. And by
the very same steps and degrees, must
we be assumpted. And this is his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of suffring, which brought
him to glorifying.</p>
            <p>The third thing is, that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb facs="tcp:293:61"/>
our followed; whereby wee are to
marke, not so much his courage, that
durst encounter with the Diuell in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
place wheresoeuer he list to carrie
him: and that hee was not onely the
God of the valleyes, but a God of the
mountaines also, contrary to their sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize,
<hi>1. King. 20. 23.</hi> That (I say) is not
so much to bee marked, as that our
Sauiour would at all stand vpon a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle.</p>
            <p>There be some that would make vs
beleeue, it is a sinne to stand vppon a
pinacle: but then if that had been so,
Christ would neuer haue stood there.
And since Christ stood there, it is no
more sinne for anie man els to stand
there, than it is to stand in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes:
for it is lawfull for vs to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his foot-steps, &amp; to tread where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
he hath trod before vs; yet such
places be not priuiledged. For as it is
true, that manie mens table &amp; wealth
is their snare, <hi>Psalm. 69. 22.</hi> so euen the
good guifts and graces of God, bee
turned to a mans hurt, as knowledge
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:293:61"/>
may serue for a quil to puffe him vp,
and make him swell, <hi>1. Cor. 8. 1.</hi> Nay,
euen that godly sorrow, which is so
much to be wished for, hath in it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of temptation, least men bee swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
vp with too much heauinesse,
<hi>2. Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 7.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scriptures themselues (wee
see) are subiect to the abuse of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell:
whereby it should followe, that
they are to be refused, if euerie thing
bee to be refused which brings matter
of temptation. But as <hi>Augustin</hi> saith,
<hi>Non est laus stetisse in pinaculo, sed ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisse
&amp; non cecidisse.</hi> In euerie place to
answere the diuell, is praise-worthie.
Indeede it is daungerous for one that
hath a light and giddie brain, for such
as are dronke, <hi>Esa. 51. 22.</hi> (though not
with wine) to stand so high.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iob</hi> could stand there without fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
for he had a more settled braine,
<hi>Iob. 31. 27.</hi> Such places are for the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
and sagest men. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> stood
not there, but yet he could haue stood
there, for he had the trick or skill of it,
<pb facs="tcp:293:62"/>
as himselfe confesseth, <hi>Phil. 4. 12. I can
be abased, and I can abound, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now come we to the Temptation
it selfe, which hath three generall
heads. First, the ball of wilde fire;
which is to consume his faith. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the dart, <hi>Cast thy selfe downe;</hi> which
is to peirce the soule. Thirdlie, hee
tempereth the head of his dart with
some stronger mettal; which is, <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
est.</hi>
            </p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>I.</head>
               <p>First, <hi>Si filius Dei es.</hi> This is a great
mote in the diuells eye, hee vseth the
same terme in the former temptation,
and here he is vp with it againe. And
al is to this end, that by often bringing
it into question whether we bee the
sonnes of God; hee may at last make
it out of question or doubt, that wee
are not the sonnes of God: that by &amp;
from <hi>Si sis,</hi> he may bring it to <hi>Ne sis;</hi>
and so we may be like himselfe.</p>
               <p>For to this end is al his compassing
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:293:62"/>
of sea and land, to make one Proselyte
like himselfe, according to the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor
of the Pharisies, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 15. who
did in like sort, and when he is made,
yee make him (two-fold more) the
childe of hell, than your selues: as on
the other side, Christ would haue vs
the sonnes of God like him. But see
what a dexteritie the diuell hath, in
making things serue for his purpose:
he maketh one selfe same thing serue
for two seuerall, yea, contrarie purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
What a goodly grace he hath in
the first Temptation? Hee vseth it
there to procure vs to desperation: he
maketh it heere serue for presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But indeed there be two manner of
<hi>Si es,</hi> or <hi>Ifs:</hi> the one is a questioning
or doubting <hi>Si,</hi> as, <hi>If thou be the sonne
of God, shew vs a signe,</hi> Mar. 8. 12. <hi>Lord
if thou wilt, thou canst make me whole.
Mat.</hi> 8. 2. The other is a plaine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,
as <hi>Phil. 3. 11 If by any means
I might attaine to the resurrection of the
dead:</hi> where we are sure he made no
<pb facs="tcp:293:63"/>
doubt thereof. So here the diuell saith
<hi>If thou be the Sonne of God,</hi> as I now
graunt indeede. I was in some doubt,
but now I confesse thou art: I am of
the voyces minde, that pronounced
thee so at thy Baptisme.</p>
               <p>The diuell (in the former tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
came out like a malecontent, or
a murmurer: heere hee comes lyke a
flattering parasite, he will <hi>pinguare ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put
eius oleo,</hi> make his head euen swim
in the oyle of ostentation. But though
it be not the same temptation, yet it is
the same diuell in both places: for
both by the one and other, he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the downfall and destruction of
man: and though his two <hi>Ifs</hi> bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
in themselues, yet are they both
also contrarie to the will and word of
God: for he would not in any case we
should distrust him, neither would he
that at anie time wee should cast our
selues downe. And therefore hath he
caused battlements to bee made on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
house top, that none might bee
slaine with falling downe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 8.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:293:63"/>
Now hee would haue him shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
(thereby) to bee the Sonne of
God, for hee is now in the sight of all
<hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is said, that Christ comes now to
put too a spark of fier, that is of faith,
&amp; that his will was, it might burne &amp;
be maintained. The diuell on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, labours by all meanes possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to quench and put it out: and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
water would not doo it in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
temptation; he goeth now about
to see, if he can make the verie oyle it
self to put it out, euen that very thing
whereby it were to be maintained: as
indeede it will, if wee powre out too
great a quantitie. Or if hee cannot
quench it, either with water or oile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he
wil see if he can blow it vp with gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder.</p>
               <p>As<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seeing the water of distrust will
not extinguish his faith, but that hee
would trust in God: he endeuoureth
now by Scriptures (that magnifie the
prouidence of GOD, and the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
we are to put in him) to set him
<pb facs="tcp:293:64"/>
as farre gone in the other extream, by
presuming or trusting too much, that
so the fier, which before hee would
haue quenched, maye nowe so flame
out, as, not to keepe it selfe within the
chimnie, but to set the whole house on
fier. This is the ball of wilde-fier of
this second Temptation: and so both
we see tend to the consuming &amp; nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying
of our faith.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="part">
               <head>II.</head>
               <p>The dart it self is, <hi>Cast thy self down:</hi>
which consisteth of two poynts. First,
the casting downe: secondly, that hee
himselfe was to cast downe himselfe.</p>
               <p>For the first, it is generall, the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of ordinarie meanes; as heere:
whereas the ordinarie way was down
the staires, he would haue him leap,
or throwe himselfe ouer the Battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And heere a man maye see to
what ende the Diuells halting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth:
he brings a man vp by little &amp;
little to some high place, that so hee
may send him at once with his head
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:293:64"/>
downward. All the preferments that
he bestoweth on a man, is not to anie
other intent, but that hee may doo as
the diuell himselfe did, (who beeing
on high<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did cast himselfe downe) and
so bee like him. <hi>Io.</hi> 8. 23. that is, from
beneath, not from aboue: who fell
from heauen like lightning, <hi>Luc.</hi> 10. 18
So that howsoeuer in outward showe
he may seeme to befrend vs, yet this is
his inward intention and scoape. As
the <hi>Edomites</hi> in time of the prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> pretended great
good will to them: but in the day of
their calamitie, they were they that
cryed, <hi>Downe with them, downe with
them, Psalm.</hi> 137. 7.</p>
               <p>Gods manner is, when he meaneth
to exalt a man, hee will first humble
him, and make him low, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 12.
The diuels manner is (we see) cleane
contrarie, <hi>Esa.</hi> 14. 14. to lift them vp to
the clowdes, that he may bring them
downe to the graue, yea to the lowest
graue, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 86. 13. He carieth them
the higher, to throwe them downe
<pb facs="tcp:293:65"/>
with the greater violence. He lifteth
vp <hi>Adam</hi> with a conceipt, to bee like
God, to the verie top of perfection to
the intent he might bee like the beast
that perisheth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 49. 20.</p>
               <p>The second hath some matter of
comfort: the Diuell is here a suter to
him, to doo it himselfe. Why doth not
the diuell cast him downe? First, it
was not in his power; or if it had, yet
would not that haue serued his turne:
then there had been no sinne of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
in it. There must bee two
persons that must concurre in our
downfall: well may the diuell induce
and mooue vs to it; but vnles we our
selues be consenting, &amp; cast our selues
downe, there can be no downe-fall to
hurt vs. For as <hi>Chrisostome</hi> saith, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
laeditur nisi a seipso:</hi> so <hi>Nullum pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitium
nisi voluntarium.</hi> The Diuell
did not cramme <hi>Eue</hi> with the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
frute: but when shee saw it, shee

therefore we are to looke for
<pb facs="tcp:293:66"/>
some great matter: he bringeth scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that he may be the better credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
He speaks not now after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of men, <hi>1. Cor. 9. 8.</hi> so that it is not
he now that speaketh, but Scripture,
as <hi>Paul</hi> reasoneth there. <hi>You see</hi> (saith

               <p>The diuell knewe well by his owne
fall, how dangerous the sinne of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
is, it cost him dearely, and
so did <hi>Dauid</hi> likewise, and therfore of
all other, he praieth God to keep him
from presumptuous sinnes: <hi>Psal. 19.
13.</hi> He knew also what it was to abuse
the goodnes, patience and long suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of God, <hi>Rom. 2. 4.</hi> Therefore he
auoucheth it by scripture: he tels him
it will be long to goe downe the stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and teacheth him a nearer waye,
but a iump, or to cast himselfe down,
and to feare no hurt, for the Angells
haue charge of him.</p>
               <p>And euen so hee perswadeth men
now a dayes; that they neede not goe

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:293:66"/>
trembling, but to deferre all till theyr

they be Gods darlings, and God doth

               <p>If euer the diuell came in his like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
it was here. In the first of <hi>Sam.

Saule among the Prophets?</hi> it might
haue been said, What, is the diuell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the prophetes? But heere hee
hath vsed himselfe so cunningly, that
if euer hee was transformed into an
Angell of light, here it is verefied. <hi>1.
Cor. 11. 14.</hi> for he commeth here lyke
a white diuell, or like a Diuine, hee
comes with a Psalter in his hand, and
turnes to the place, &amp; shewes our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
<pb facs="tcp:293:67"/>
the 91. <hi>Psalm. vers.</hi> 11. and <hi>12.</hi>
wherein first we are to noate, that the
diuell readeth Psalmes, as well as we,
and hath the wordes of Scripture in
his mouth. And <hi>1. Sam. 28.</hi> he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited
<hi>Samuel</hi> so right, and vsed the
verie words that he had vsde, that they
could not know him from <hi>Samuel:</hi> so
heere hee counterfeited the voyce of
<hi>Dauid, Act. 19. 15.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This will make vs shake off secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
considering that God doth (for
our tryall) sometime deliuer the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie
the keye of the Armourie,
whereby he is able to hold argument
with an Archangell, <hi>Iude 9.</hi> yea, with
Christ himselfe, as we see here. How
carefull therefore had we need to be,
to finde out a fit answere for him? For
onely to assault vs doth hee reade the
Scriptures: yea, but not to anie good
end, but euen thereby to deceaue the
simplicitie of men; as heere, to make
them put their soules in aduenture to
the last hower.</p>
               <p>He hath indeed a grace with some
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:293:67"/>
vaine youths of the Court, &amp; vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
Atheists, to set them a scoffing at
the Scripture, as <hi>Esay 28. 22.</hi> But with
others, that haue the Scriptures in

the sauour of death, <hi>Roman. chapt. 7.
vers. 10.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words which hee vseth in the
name of <hi>Samuel,</hi> hee vseth to make
<hi>Saule</hi> dispaire: and here he vseth <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi>
words to cause presumption, and
to make them our bane. And not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
Scripture: but if there bee anie
Scripture more full of heauenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
than another, that of all other wil
the diuell abuse; as indeed the psalms
are; and of all the Psalmes, this <hi>91.</hi> es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially:
and in that part, if anie one
sentence be sweeter than another, that
of all other will the diuell abuse.</p>
               <p>Mark the second verse here cyted.
<hi>He shall giue his Angells charge ouer
thee, to keepe thee in all thy wayes.</hi> These
last wordes the diuell leaues out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they make not for his purpose.
<pb facs="tcp:293:68"/>
                  <hi>They shall beare thee in their hands, that
thou dash not thy foote against a stone.</hi>
And we shall see nothing can be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
more comfortablie: as first, in that
it is said, that the Angels haue charge
ouer vs in all our wayes: <hi>Exod. 23. 20.
Behold I send my Angell before thee, to
guide thee in the way,</hi> and to comfort,
and confirme vs: as when <hi>Iacob</hi> was
in feare of his brother <hi>Esau,</hi> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
met him, <hi>Gen. 32. 1.</hi> and to defend
vs in all dangers, and succour vs in all
necessities, spreading their winges o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
vs, and pitching their tents about
vs, <hi>Psal. 34. 7.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, this charge not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
our head and principal mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
but also our feet: yea, Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
reacheth euen to the haires of
our head, for they are numbred, <hi>Mat. 10. 30.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, this charge of theirs is not
onely to admonish vs when daunger
commeth, but they are actually to
help vs, as it were putting their hands
betweene the ground and vs. <hi>Mat. 13.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:293:68"/>
41.</hi> they shall take the rubs and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
out of our way.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this doo they not of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,
as being creatures giuen of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to loue mankinde, but by speciall
mandate and charge they are bounde
to it, and haue a <hi>praecipe</hi> for it, yea, the
very beasts &amp; stones shalbe in league
with vs. <hi>Iob. 5. 23.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Psalme, and these verses con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining
such comfort, hath the Diuell
culled to perswade men, that beeing
such sweete Children of God, they
may venture whether and vpon what
they will; for the Angels attend them
at an inch. He bids them put the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in aduenture, and then but whistle
for an Angell, and they will come at
first: he carieth them vp to the top of
the pinacle, and shewes them theyr
owne case in <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Herod;</hi> and
tells them God will require no more
of them, than he did at their hands: &amp;
all the way as they goe vp, he singeth
them a Psalm of the mercies of God:
<pb facs="tcp:293:69"/>
he carrieth them vp with a song, that
Gods mercie is aboue all his workes,
<hi>Psalm. 145. 9.</hi> And with <hi>Psalm. 103. 8.</hi>
how gracious and long-suffring God
is, who rewardeth vs not according to
our deserts: and <hi>Psalm. 136. That his
mercie endureth for euer:</hi> God therfore
beeing so full of mercie, will take all
things in good part. But this mercye
the diuell tells them of, differeth from
the mercie <hi>Dauid</hi> meant: for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<hi>Dauid</hi> speaketh of, is coupled with
iudgement, <hi>Psal. 101. 1. I will sing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and iudgement to thee O Lord:</hi> and
<hi>Psal. 85. 10. Mercie &amp; truth are met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
Iustice and peace haue kissed each
other.</hi> Thus I say they shall haue mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sique
al the way, &amp; if any at the height
thinke it a great way downe: no, saith
the diuell, you need but a iumpe from
your baptisme into heauen, you shall
need no staires at all.</p>

himselfe to answere. Wee see
<pb facs="tcp:293:70"/>
that a message comming in the name
of the Lord, this verie name abashed
<hi>Nehemias, (Nehe. 6. 10.)</hi> at the first
hearing, till hee perceaued it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to the law of God, and so came
not from him: which here we see to
bee the cause, why Christ dooth not
yeeld by and by, vpon the hearing of
the Woord, but sets himselfe to make
answere: forsomuch as the word is not
of force, <hi>Quia dicitur</hi> onely, but <hi>Quia
creditur,</hi> as <hi>Augustine</hi> noteth. If there
bee not the mixture of faith with it,
(whereof <hi>Paule</hi> speaketh, <hi>Hebr. 4. 2.)</hi>
it is nothing worth. And therfore the
badde spirite was nothing abashed or
daunted, at the hearing of the bare
names of <hi>Iesus</hi> and <hi>Paule, Act. 19. 15.</hi>
but answered, <hi>I know them, but who are
ye?</hi> They did not beleeue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could doo them no good, but
were wounded themselues: glorious
names would not serue the turne. So
was it here vsed without faith.</p>
            <p>When the Scripture is heere vrged
against one, a man would thinke it
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:293:70"/>
were not to be answered by cyting an
other place of Scripture; but by some
tradition of the Elders, <hi>Mark 7. 1.</hi> or
some glosse, or other shift; but wee
see our Sauiour answereth here no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way but by Scripture.</p>
            <p>Because the wolfe comes somtimes
disguised in a sheeps skin, it is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that therefore the verie sheepe
should lay away their fleeces: so here,
because the diuell vseth the word, as
the slaying letter, <hi>2. Corin. 3. 6.</hi> or as the
sword to kill men with; it is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why Christ may not therfore vse
it in his owne defence. Why then (wil
some say) one of these two inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
will followe; that hereby we
shall thinke the Scripture is of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells
side, aswell as of Christs side, &amp;
so diuided; as in like sort they make a
diuision of Christ, when one holdes
with <hi>Paule,</hi> another of <hi>Apollos, 1. Cor. 1.
13.</hi> No, it is not so, Christ alleadgeth
not this Scripture in that sort, as one
nayle to driue out another: but by way
of harmonie and exposition, that the
<pb facs="tcp:293:71"/>
one may make plaine the meaning of
the other. For albeit the diuell shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
himselfe to be the diuell, in cyting
that Text so, as might best serue for
his purpose: in that, whereas the
Psalme whereout he taketh it, hath it
thus, <hi>That he might keepe him in all his
wayes;</hi> which words hee leaueth out.
For if he had cyted that, he could not
thereby haue enforced anye casting
down: for the Angels haue no charge
ouer a man, but in his wayes; &amp; from
the toppe of the pinacle there was no
way, but down the staires on his feet.
He was not (relying on the Angells)
to cast himselfe downe with his head
forward. But the diuell hath a wrest,
to make the string sound hie or low,
as he list; or if that will not serue, hee
hath a racke to stretch them out, as
some did Saint <hi>Paules</hi> Epistles, <hi>2. Pet.
3. 16.</hi> He can set them on the tenters,
to proue, that downe the staires, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the battlements, all is one, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
shall safe-gard him.</p>
            <p>Though this (I say) be the Diuells
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:293:71"/>
corruption, which the late Wryters
haue well spyed: yet Christ (we see)
is not willing to take aduauntage of
that, but vseth a wiser course; for so
are we to think, that he went the best
way to worke, that is, the conference
of Scripture with Scripture, which
Christ here practiseth, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vnto vs.</p>
            <p>In euerie Arte, all propositions are
not of a like certaintie, but some bee
grounds and principles so certaine, as
that no exception is to bee taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them. From them are others
deriued, by a consequence called <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,</hi>
not so certaine as the other:
from these againe others, to the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
hand. So is it in Diuinitie. Christ
here reduceth the diuels argument &amp;
place, to a place most plaine to bee
confessed. For the Iewes valuing of
the meanes, had to consider, that God
fedde them with Manna, which they
knew not, to teach them, that <hi>Man
liueth not by bread onely, Deut. 8. 3.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
the same: and in <hi>Deut. 6. 16.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:293:72"/>
bad them they should not tempt their
Lord their God, as in <hi>Massah,</hi> when
they cried for bread. The Lord cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
him, that maketh flesh his arme,
and with-draweth his hart from God,
<hi>Ierem. 17. 5.</hi> They sacrificed vnto their
yarne, because their portion was plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull,
<hi>Abac. 1. 16. Iob</hi> condemneth the
making golde our hope, or the wedge
of golde our confidence, <hi>chap. 31. ver.
24.</hi> As then wee must not deifie the
meanes, attributing all sufficiencie to
them: so we may not nullifie them, &amp;
thinke too basely of them, but vse
them, that we tempt not God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his word.</p>
            <p>Out of these two grounds, may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
question be resolued: for euerie
proposition must be prooued out of
the ground. So that, as wee may not
thinke the arme of God to be so shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened,
that he cannot help without
meanes: so are we not to thinke base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of God, for ordaining meanes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we heard, that the diuels
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:293:72"/>
allegation was taken out of the psalm,
and one of the most comfortable pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of all the Psalme. Christ by not
standing in Disputation about the
words and meaning of the text, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth
to vs the safest and wisest
way to make answere in such like ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
Our Sauiour would warne vs, that
the psalme 91. is not fit matter for vs
to studie on, when we are on the top
of the pinacle: he therefore chooseth
a place of a contrarie kinde, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoise
himselfe, standing in that tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
place.</p>
            <p>The Law (we know) is a great coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
to presumption. If one tamper
much with the Psalmes, beeing in the
case of confidence, hee may make the
fier too bigge. Faith is the fier which
Christ came to put on the earth, and
it is seated betweene two extreames,
Distrust, and Presumption. Distrust
is as water to it, which if it be powred
on in abundance, it will make it to be
smoaking flaxe, or vtterly quench it:
Presumption (on the other side) is a
<pb facs="tcp:293:73"/>
gunpowder to it, which being thrown
into it, it will blowe it vp, and make it
flye all about the house. Christ was to
take heede of ouer-heating his faith.
<hi>Luther</hi> vpon the <hi>Galathians</hi> saith, the
91. Psalme is no meete studie for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
mens humors in our dayes: they
had more need of a corosiue, to eate
out the soare of the roote and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.</p>
            <p>Now to the Answere, which consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
of sixe poynts. First, what it is
to tempt God: secondly, wherein:
thirdly, the manner how: fourthly,
this proposition, <hi>Thou shalt not tempt:</hi>
fifthly, the reason why wee may not:
sixtly, though he be our God, and we
on the pinacle, these be no arguments
for vs to presume.</p>
            <div n="1" type="part">

               <p>First, whosoeuer will not vse such
ordinarie means as God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
tempteth God: if hee vse extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie,
(as heere the Diuell would
haue Christ doo) when no body went
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:293:73"/>
about to thrust him downe, wilfullie
to haue cast himselfe downe, were
great madnes: or when a man hath a
faire paire of staires to go downe by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to call for a Cherub to carrie him, or
for the winde to flye downe, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 18.
10. were great wantonnes.</p>
               <p>There is an humor in man, that we
are all giuen vnto by nature; to bee
meruailous desirous to trie conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in matters that are rare, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
vnto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> contemning things
common, and to be fond after strange
nouelties. It was told them as plaine
as could be, that they should not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
of the Manna till morning, and
they needed not to haue reserued it,
they had flesh euerie day: and yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth
they would needes keepe it, if it
were but for an experiment sake, to
trie whether it would stink or no, <hi>Exo.</hi>
16. 20. And though they were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to gather on the Sabaoth day, and
on the euen had enough for two dais,
and it was told them they should find
none; yet they must needs try. When
<pb facs="tcp:293:74"/>
a thing cannot bee had without great
difficultie, it is our manner to haue a
vehement longing after it, as when
<hi>Dauid</hi> was in a holde, and the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

               <p>Now followe the reasons why wee
may not tempt God. There be two
sorts of tempting: the one, by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:293:79"/>
the other by vnbeliefe. It is the
manner of Surgeons, when they are
to dresse a wound, and know not how
farre, nor which way it goeth, to tent
it: In the same manner is God (after
the manner of men) said to tempt vs,
sometimes to prooue what is in our
harts, and whether we will keepe hys
commaundements, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 2. as hee
did the <hi>Israelites</hi> fortie yeeres. To this
end he both made them hungrie, and
fed them with Manna. We sometimes
tempt God, as if the arme of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
had receiued a wound, or his eye
a hurt, as if he could not helpe or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern
our wants, aswel now as before,
because he brings vs not water out of

now are not agreeing with his
will, which must content vs: hee
will haue mercie on whom hee will

not despise the riches of his bounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes

which leadeth to repentaunce,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. The Lords hand is not shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened,

that it cannot saue; nor his eare

(when he would not beleeue the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel

signe for incredulitie: he had been as

               <p>The second kind of tempting, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
of ouer-much familiaritie,
when as we thinke wee may bee bold
with God, and that hee will take it in
good part, and therefore wee will put
him to it, (as we say) we will try both
him and his Angels, what mettall is in
them, and what they can doo. Wee
are to thinke vpon the name of God,
as of a heauie and weightie thing, that
is not vpon euery small occasion to be
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:293:80"/>
taken vp and remooued. We are not
to accompt it as a feather, that wee
may lightly tosse vp and down at our
pleasure: &amp; euen so are we to esteeme
of the mercie of God. It is not to be
aduocated vppon euerie vaine trifle,
for that were to vse God as wee are
wont to vse our Iuglers. Come on let
vs see what you can doo, shewe vs a
myracle, say they, <hi>Exodus chap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. ver.</hi>
11. So <hi>Herode</hi> desired to see Christ,
that hee might see some myracle of

when afterwards in the two &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth

him, and bad him read who stroke
him. We our selues wold not be so v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,

especialy not to be made a pack-horse

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T the first ouerthrow,
we had the first <hi>Again:</hi>
and when Christ ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threwe
him then also,
yet would not the diuel
leaue then neither, but hee commeth
with his second <hi>Againe:</hi> he comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
and againe. The first <hi>Againe,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:293:84"/>
was an argument of his courage and
stomacke: this second, is an argument
of his importunitie.</p>
            <p>The first repulse could not driue
him away, nor the second neither, no,
nor this third for altogether: for <hi>Luke</hi>
saith, <hi>He departed for a season, Lu.</hi> 4. 13.
So that as Christ saith, <hi>Iohn 16. 16. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a while ye shall see mee, and after a
while you shall not see mee:</hi> so saith the
diuel also, <hi>After a while you shall not see
mee, &amp; againe after a while you shal see
me.</hi> Which teacheth vs this lesson, that
it is not enough to haue preuailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his temptations twice or thrice,
&amp; so become secure: but we are alway
to stand vpon our gard, knowing how
the diuel wil successiuely, euery turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a hand, be with vs; &amp; that while
we liue, we shall neuer be at rest with
him: or if he tempt vs not, we shalbe
in as bad or worse case. For so long as
the Lord left other Nations among
the <hi>Israelits,</hi> to proue them by, &amp; to be
pricks to their sides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wel inough

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:293:84"/>
to liue in some security (hauing
for the most part subdued them) then
grew they to mutuall dissention. It is
the greatest temptation, to be without
temptation. Therefore <hi>Paule</hi> had the
messenger of satan to buffet him, 2. <hi>Co.</hi>
127 for then followes the pressing of
God by praiers. But whether we ioyn
hands with satan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or resist him, we shal
be sure he will set vpon vs, &amp; try by
faire meanes what he can doo, or if we
say nay, yet in the end he wil weary vs
as <hi>Dalila</hi> did <hi>Sampson, Iud.</hi> 16. 16. who,
because she was importunate, his soul
was pained to the death, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he told
her: or if we wil be obstinate in reiect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his temptations, giuing him at the

               <hi>Ie.</hi> 18. 18. he will be rough
with vs. If none of these will preuaile,
he will perswade vs, wee must be like
other men, &amp; that is as profitable or
plesant to vs, &amp; then say <hi>Samuel</hi> what
he can, we will haue a king, 1. <hi>Sa.</hi> 8. 19.
<pb facs="tcp:293:85"/>
And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue yeelded once, then
goes he to fetch companie, and takes
vnto him seauen worse spirites than
himselfe, <hi>Luc.</hi> 11. 26. So the last state
of that man is worse than the first.
Giue but an inch, and he will take an
ell: if he can get in but an arme, he wil
make shift to shooue in his whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
As we see<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the poynt of a nayle
haue once made entrie, the rest will
soone in.</p>
            <p>We see an example of his encroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
euen in <hi>Daiud, 2. Sam.</hi> 11. 4. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had once made him commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultrie
by some meane degrees wyth
<hi>Bethsheba,</hi> see how hee tolls him on
from one wickednes to another. She
was with childe, her husband beeing
in the seruice of God and the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
was by the King murdred to hide her
shame, and satisfie his lust. So did he
drawe on <hi>Peter,</hi> first hee made him
follow a loofe off; secondly, flatlie to
denie Christ; thirdly, to forsweare
him; and fourthly, to curse himselfe
if he knew him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:293:85"/>The Hebrue Writers note, that the
Diuells name <hi>Belzebub,</hi> signifieth a
great flesh flye, or a master flye: flap
him away neuer so often, hee will still
flie thether againe. So the diuell wyll
neuer cease molesting vs, till the smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
flaxe be quite quenched, and the
brused reed cleane broken, <hi>Esa.</hi> 42. 3.</p>
            <p>First, he twists certaine smal threds
together, and so makes a little cord of
vanitie, to drawe vs vnto him: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with a cart-roape or gable of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquitie,
he seekes to binde vs fast vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him for starting; either by the vice
of lust, or of enuie, or at least coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes.
But if all should faile, pryde is
sure to hold. <hi>Oh Lord, I thanke thee, I
am not like such and such, nor like this
Publicane</hi> (a degree further) <hi>nor lyke
this Pharisie, Luc.</hi> 18. 11.</p>
            <p>This may be a good caueat vnto vs,
that we stand alway vpon our gard, &amp;
that we be sure that wee make strong
resistance in the beginning, and break
it (if we can) while it is but a whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.
And to vse the like pollicie in a
<pb facs="tcp:293:86"/>
good matter, that the King of <hi>Egipt</hi>
did in a bad; who tooke order that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
male childe should be killed, to
keepe the <hi>Israelites</hi> downe betimes: &amp;
against the succession of temptation,
to entertaine the succession of prayer.</p>
            <p>Now to the matter. The Diuell
deales as with a Citie. In the first he
tells him, he must be famished, except
hee can turne stones into bread. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
he comes to make a traine of
Scripture to intrap him. Now hee
comes to the ordinary meanes of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
that is; when men striue about
anie thing, and both parties are loath
to yeeld, there will be some parley of
composition and sharing betweene
them. So here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the diuell seeing that
he cannot ouer-throw his faith, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
him to compound: and (on hys
part) hee is content to giue Christ all
the Kingdomes of the world, if our
Sauiour (for his part) will but fall
downe, and worship him.</p>
            <p>The diuel before came disguised in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:293:86"/>
the shape of a male-content, as that
Christ should bee in such hunger.
Next, he came in the habite of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine,
and that verie demurely, with
his Psalter in his hand. Now he comes
in all his Royaltie, like the Prince of
this world, as he is so called, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 30.
Hee dooth not stand pelting wyth
Christ, but goes roundly and franke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to woorke: hee offers all that hee
hath, (and that is no small matter)
to bring Christ but to one sinne, that
so hee might ouer-throwe all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</p>
            <p>He comes no more now with <hi>Si fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Dei es:</hi> for that we see is here left,
he would not haue him thinke on it,
hee would haue him now <hi>filius seculi.</hi>
This is called by Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching
Temptation, whereby men
become so foolish, as that after they
haue begun in the spirite, they wyll
ende in the flesh, <hi>Galath.</hi> 3. 3. Where
the Diuell cannot preuayle, eyther
by our owne concupiscence, or by hys
enticings: hee will see what hee can
<pb facs="tcp:293:87"/>
doo with his Dragons taile, and by
that meanes (say the Fathers) hee did
more hurt, than by the other. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
his tayle is said to drawe downe the
third part of the starres of heauen,
and to cast them to the earth. <hi>Apoc.</hi>
12. 4.</p>
            <p>Wee are heere to consider, first the
preparation that the diuell makes, by
taking him vp to an high hill, to make
the offer <hi>vers.</hi> 8. Secondly, the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it selfe, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. Thirdly, our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
answere, and the shield he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

of the conflict, the victorie, <hi>vers. 11.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the first we are to consider, first
the diuells methode: secondly, the
place and ground: thirdly, his polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
in not onely telling what he would
giue; but in shewing thereof: fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the things themselues which hee
offers, which are two; the kingdome
of the earth, and the glorie thereof.</p>

               <p>First, of his methode. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 14.
we are warned not to be wauering, &amp;
caried about with euerie wynd of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
by the deceipt and craftines of
men, whereby they lye in waite to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.
Craftines and deceipt then, be
the instruments which the Diuell v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth;
he brings Christ from the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse
to the Temple, and from the
Temple to the Mountain, to destroy
the Temple, which Mountain is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie.
So in aduersitie wee vowe to
God, that we will serue him; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
helpe, we breake it.</p>

            <div n="2" type="part">
               <head>II.</head>
               <p>Secondly, the lysts wher this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
was vsed, was the Mountaine.
The reason why hee chose this place
rather than anie other, is the fitnes of
it, in regard of the prospect. The wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes
(we know) was a melancholie
<pb facs="tcp:293:88"/>
place, and in no wise fit for this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
so, neither was the pinacle: for
besides that it might haue hindred the
working of this temptation, beeyng
the pinacle of the Temple; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
was not good enough. For
though it were high, yet there were
diuers hilles about <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> vvhich
would haue hindred the sight of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And though <hi>Sion</hi> were a
mountaine, yet in respect of Mount
<hi>Hermon</hi> and <hi>Lybanus,</hi> it is sayd to bee
but a little one, <hi>Psal.</hi> 42. 6. and <hi>Psalm.</hi>
68. 16. <hi>Basan</hi> is said to be the great hill.
Therefore, as good chose a conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
hill, both for height and neerenes,
where hee might behold the whole
Land of <hi>Chanaan, Deut.</hi> 32. 49. So here
the Diuell chose an exceeding high
mountaine, wher a high minde might
best take view and contemplate: such,
where his horizon might be as spaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as was possible, &amp; where his sight
might not be hindered by any meane
obiect.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, he sets before his eies al the
kingdomes of the earth. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so soone entised &amp; led awaye, as
the eye: it is the Broker betweene the
hart &amp; all wicked lusts that be in the
world. And therefore it was great
follie in <hi>Ezechias,</hi> to shew his roabes
and treasure, <hi>Esa.</hi> 39. 2. as he was told
by the Prophete: it stirred vp such
coales of desire in them that sawe
them, as could not bee quenched, till
they had fetcht awaye all that he had,
and all that his Auncestours had layd
vp euen till that day.</p>
               <p>It is the wisedome that is vsed nowe
a dayes, when men would haue one
thing for another, to shewe the thing
they would so exchange: as the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
sheweth his money, and the seller
his wares in the best manner that hee
can, each to entice the other (by the
eye) to the desire of the hart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:293:89"/>It is the diuels ancient sleight, he wold
not go about to perswade the matter
in words, till he might withall present
the thing to the eye.</p>
               <p>So he dealt with <hi>Eue, Gen. 3. 6.</hi> First
he shewed her how pleasant the frute
was, and the woman sawe it. So the
cause of the deluge was, <hi>Gen. 6. 2.</hi> that
the sonnes of God saw the beautie of
the daughters of men. <hi>Achabs</hi> seeing
of <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard, <hi>1. Kin. 21. 2.</hi> for
that it laye neere his house, was the
cause of all the mischiefe that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
This same foolish vanitie of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
(whereof I haue giuen so often
warning out of this place,) comes
from hence. <hi>I saw a fine Babilonish gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and desiring it, I tooke it,</hi> saith <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan,
Iosua<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 7. 21. So the seeing of the
brybe, blindeth the eyes of the Iudge,
<hi>Deut. 16. 19.</hi> So still the sight of the
eye, allureth the hart to desire.</p>
               <p>The Heathen man therefore wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that vertue and honestie might as
well bee seene with bodily eyes: for
then he thinketh, that <hi>Admirabiles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores

                     </gap>.</hi> So if we could as
well see that which God hath for vs,
as that the diuell here offereth vs: we
would not regard the diuels largesse.
<hi>Moses</hi> and the other Patriarchs saw
him which is inuisible, which had
prouided a better thing for them:
therefore he refused to bee called the
sonne of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter, <hi>Heb. 11.
27.</hi> and to enjoy the pleasure of sinne.</p>
               <p>But you are not so to take it, as
though it were a thing simplie ill to
behold such things, or to looke on a
cup-boord of plate, or to stand on a
pinacle, it is dangerous, but no sinne;
especially, it is vnfit for an vnstayed &amp;
an vngouerned eye. Therefore <hi>Lot</hi> &amp;
his wife were forbidden to look back
at the destruction of <hi>Sodome, Gen. 19.
17.</hi> To <hi>Abraham</hi> it was left at large,
without anie restraint: for that he was
a man of better ruled affections. For
as there must be one without, to take
view and to entice: so must there bee
one within, to hearken to it &amp; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discend.
Be sure of that within, that

Christs minde (as he thought) by
shewing him that he wold giue him:
now he comes in with a short and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
oration; <hi>All this will I giue thee.</hi>
Heere thou seest all thou canst wish
for: without thee shall no man lift vp
his hand or his foote in all <hi>Egipt,</hi> as
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> said to <hi>Ioseph, Gen. 41. 44.</hi> so as
he might make all Captaines, &amp; giue
to euerie one fields and vineyards, <hi>1.
Sam. 22. 7.</hi> that hee maye say to euerie
one what he list; <hi>Speakest thou to mee?</hi>
Seest thou not that I haue povver to
crucifie thee, or to let thee goe? <hi>Iohn
19. 10.</hi> that his fauour might rayse a
man so high, as <hi>Haman</hi> was exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all the Princes, <hi>Hest. 3. 1.</hi> and his
disfauour, or the least word of his
mouth quite ouerthrowe him, as <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
was <hi>verse. 7. 8.</hi> by picking some
small quarrell against him.</p>
               <p>But this is not all neyther: for
this same garish apparell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
manye doo delyght, is contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnder this <hi>Haec omnia:</hi> Not
onelye embroydered with golde, but
<pb facs="tcp:293:93"/>
euen gold it selfe, and smells of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
sent, <hi>Psalm. 45. 8.</hi> and <hi>9.</hi> And as
for the delights of the flesh, if he can
see anie that delight him better than
other: it is no more than with <hi>Dauid
2. Sam. 11. 4.</hi> to send for her, and haue
her, she was straight at his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.
Neither must any say, it was
vnlawfull: no, not <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> if hee
loue his head, <hi>Mark. 6. 17.</hi> Hee may
commaund what he list; if any gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say
it, he may dispatch him out of the
vvay: for hee maye kill and vvound
vvhom he list, <hi>Dan. 5. 19.</hi> hee maye
commaund all mens tongues, <hi>2. Sam.</hi>
14. 10. that they dare not once open
theyr mouth to speake against him.
Nay, he shall haue all mens tongues &amp;
pens readie to extoll all that he doth,
and say; The King is like an Angell
of God, <hi>2. Sam. 19.</hi> or that it is the
voyce of God, and not of man, <hi>Act.
12. 22.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why, then to haue all mens hands,
feete, bodies, faces, tongues, and pens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
this may be vvel said <hi>All,</hi> to haue not
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:293:93"/>
onely one kingdome, but all: to haue
all the power &amp; glorie of those king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes:
here is euen all the kingdome,
the power, and the glorie. He comes
not after a pelting manner, he shewes
himselfe a franke chapman: hee sayth
not that <hi>Godlines is great gayne, and a
minde content with his lot, 1. Tim. 6. 6.</hi>
and wills him to be content with food
and raiment, <hi>ver. 8.</hi> He comes not with
<hi>Illae,</hi> which we shall not once beholde
till another world come; and whether
there bee anie such or no, may doubt.
He shewes him a mount that may be
touched, <hi>Heb. 12. 18.</hi> hee comes wyth
<hi>haec,</hi> that is, with readie money in hys
hand: he not onely offers, but stakes
downe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and whereas God saith, that in
the sweate of our fore-head we shall
eate our bread, <hi>Genes. 3. 19.</hi> the Diuell
requires no such thing. This is a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiue,
<hi>Haec omnia dabo:</hi> What saye
ye now? Shall Christ take it, or no?</p>
               <p>The Heathen man saith, If a man
be to violate his faith for anie thing, it
is for a kingdome. Christ hath here
<pb facs="tcp:293:94"/>
offered him all kingdomes, a very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising
bayt: but is there neuer a hook
hidden vnder it? The woman was
fine and braue, and had a cup of gold
in her hand: but it was full of abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
<hi>Apoc. 17. 4.</hi> So heere, for all
these faire shewes, if you will gain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
thing by the diuel, you must wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him: that is the condition annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the graunt, it is no absolute gift,
the diuell is not so kinde, as to part
from all that for nothing. It is such a
gift as the Lawyers call <hi>Excambium,</hi>
that is, Exchaunge: I will giue you
this, if you will giue me that.</p>
               <p>But yet one would thinke it a verie
large offer, to giue so great a liewe for
so small a seruice: it is but a little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
reuerence, the bowing of the
knee; you may (notwithstanding) in
hart think what ye list. Well, we may thinke there was somewhat in it, that
the Diuell offered so much for so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and yet Christ refused it. Indeed
Christ had great reason to refuse it:
for hee should haue been a looser by
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:293:94"/>
the bargaine. I will stand to it, he had
been better to haue yeelded to either
of the two former temptations, than
to this: hee should full deerely haue
bought all his kingdomes, he had bin
better to haue cast himselfe dovvne
from the pinacle. For that which the
diuell here demaundeth is liew, is as
much worth, as both the glorie of
God, and the redemption of man.</p>
               <p>Of his glorie, God saith, That hee
will not giue it to another, <hi>Esa. 42. 8.</hi>
If to no other, then not to the Diuell
of all other. And therefore the Angel
would not haue a burnt offering of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to him, but to God, <hi>Iudg. 13. 16.</hi>
The Angell would not let <hi>Iohn</hi> fall
downe and worship him, but bad him
worship God, <hi>Reuel. 19. 10.</hi> for hee
knewe that God was varie iealous of
his honour, and stood precisely vpon
that poynt. If hee would not impart
this honour with the Angells, much
lesse would hee with the diuell: for
there are degrees in idolatrie, <hi>Roman.</hi>
1. 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:293:95"/>It is not so ill to turne the glorye of
God into the image of a man, as into
birds and beasts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if we looke into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
that he had to satisfie his auncient
enuie, by the destruction of mankind:
we must needes commend the diuells
wit, in making such a bargain. It had
been the best peny-worth that euer
was bought. For if wee marke how
Christ rateth one onely soule, we may
see, how he that to gaine all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of the world, shall loose hys
owne soule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 26. makes but a
foolish bargaine. Then what rate shal
be made of all mens soules, if one bee
worth kingdomes.</p>
               <p>All which had beene lost, if Christ
had consented to that which the diuel
here requireth: for then he could not
haue said, <hi>I restored that which I tooke
not, Psal.</hi> 69. 4. By his death he payed
the price for the sinnes of the whole
Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>: hee should then haue had a
score of his owne to haue payed, &amp; his
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:293:95"/>
death could haue beene sufficient but
for himselfe onely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If hee had fallen
downe, and worshipped him: hee
could not haue sayd, that the Prince
of this Worlde had nothing to saye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 3.</p>
               <p>Now let vs apply this to our selues.</p>
               <p>But wee will peraduenture say, the
diuell neuer made vs anie such offer:
and therefore what needes any admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
in this behalfe? But I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
though the diuell come not in
person to vs, as he did to Christ, yet he
comes by his instruments.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Balaac</hi> sent to <hi>Balaam,</hi> to
come and curse the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
him great rewards, <hi>Num.</hi> 22. 17.
it was not <hi>Balaacks</hi> messengers that
spake, but the diuell vsed them as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
to speake.</p>
               <p>So when <hi>Simon Magus</hi> would haue
bought the holy Ghost with money:
the Diuell therein tempted the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
with Symonie, <hi>Simon</hi> was but the
<pb facs="tcp:293:96"/>
trunk, through which the diuel spake,
<hi>Act.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Againe, there be some that will say,
they were neuer tempted with King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes:
it maye well be, for it needes
not, when lesse will serue. It vvas
Christ onely, that was thus tempted:
in him lay a heroicall mind, that could
not be allured with small matters.</p>
               <p>But with vs it is nothing so, wee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
far more basely of our selues:
we set our wares at a verie easie price,
he may buy vs euen dagger cheape, as
we say: he need neuer carie vs so high
as the mount, the pinacle is high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
yea, the lowest steeple in all
the Towne would serue the turne. Or
let him but carrie vs to the leades or
gutters of our owne houses, nay, let vs
but stand in our windowe, or in our
doores: if he will giue vs but so much
as we can there see, hee will tempt vs
throughly, we wil accept it, and thank
him too. He shall not neede to come
to vs with kingdomes, one kingdome
is too much, what say ye to half a one?
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:293:96"/>
                  <hi>Mar,</hi> 6. 23. No, will the diuell say, I
will giue ye halfe of one? If he would
come to vs but with thirtie pence,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 15. I am afraid manie of vs
would play <hi>Iudas.</hi> Nay, lesse than so
would buy a great sort, euen handfuls
of barley, and peeces of bread, <hi>Ezec.</hi>
13. 19. and <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 28. 21. Yea, some
will not sticke to buye and sell the
poore for a payre of shooes, as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah
in his eight chapter and sixt verse
speaketh.</p>
               <p>When he commeth then to tempt
vs, hee may abate a great deale of this
that hee offers Christ: he may stryke
out <hi>Omnia,</hi> and <hi>Haec</hi> too, and in stead
thereof put in <hi>Hoc,</hi> and say; Holde,
yee shall haue this to worship mee, I
will giue ye no more. I feare me wee
will make short woorke, and take it,
<hi>Hoc aliquid,</hi> a matter of halfe a crowne
or ten groates, a paire of shooes, or
some such trifle, will bring vs on our
knees to the diuell.</p>
               <p>Is there a pretie commoditie to be
<pb facs="tcp:293:97"/>
had? It makes no matter for breaking
faith and promise. This is that that
makes the diuell so good a husband
and thriftie, and to goe neere hand:
what neede he giue more, when so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
will serue? whereas, if we wil stand
hucking with him, wee might get a
great deale more.</p>
               <p>In this temptation (as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer)
there is both fire to consume our
saith, and a dart to wound our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.
The fire is the motion of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
that GOD is either a poore
God, not able sufficiently to rewarde
those that serue him: or else an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
God, that will not rewarde the
dueties that are perfourmed by those
that serue him. By this wee come to
say; <hi>Who is the Almightie, that wee
shold serue him? Iob. 21. 15.</hi> The wicked
are they that prosper and encrease in
riches. <hi>I haue cleansed my hart in vaine,
for daylie haue I been punished. Psal. 73.
12.</hi> Then this dart makes vs wearie of
well dooing: and then followes, that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:293:97"/>
we will serue the diuell Being discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with Gods seruice, we vndertake
the seruice of his enemie: he requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
nothing but a little falling down,
and then if <hi>Simon</hi> shall come, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
anye vnlawfull thing at our
hands, wee are readie (with <hi>Iudas</hi>) to
meete with him, and say; <hi>What wil ye
giue me, and I will doo it, Mat. 26. 15.</hi>
though it bee to the betraying of
Christ. The Diuell heere opens hys
meaning in this Temptation plainly,
(that he would haue him fall down &amp;
worship him) with a bare and bolde
face: before, hee came disguised, and
spake in parables. His meaning is not
when he saith <hi>Dabo,</hi> to giue them: but
to barter or exchange one thing for
another. It is no gift, but a flat bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
men vse not to account it a
gift, except it bee without rendring
backe either money or seruice. If hee
render here seruice back, he may well
thinke I haue solde my soule for <hi>Hoc
aliquid, Mat. 16. 76.</hi> He may think, as
<hi>Esau</hi> sold his birth-right for a messe of
<pb facs="tcp:293:98"/>
pottage. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 16. so hath hee sold
his soule, his birth right, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
for we were all bought wyth a
price, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 23. the same great high
Priest redeemed vs all with his bloud.
No sinnes are so carefully to be taken
heede of, as these, that haue annexed
to adoration, donation: he hath <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi>
with a ioynter. If he should haue
cast himselfe downe from the Pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
heere is all hee should haue had:
they would haue talkt of it, and haue
wondred a while at it.</p>
               <p>Well, we must bee thus perswaded,
that God is as well able and willing to
reward vs for anie seruice, as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
and better too. It is hee indeede
that reigneth ouer the kingdomes of
men, <hi>Dan. 5. 21.</hi> and placeth in them
whom pleaseth him: but when he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
or disposeth, hee giueth indeede
freelie, exacting nothing backe again,
vnlesse it be such things, as hee were
to haue without anie such gift, such
things as are due of meere right, with
out anie stipulation or hyre. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 5.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:293:98"/>
The Diuells <hi>Dabo,</hi> is, as Offices and
parsonages are giuen amongst vs; that
is, as vsually solde as horses in <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</hi>
But if we could bee content to
giue indeede, let that heroicall minde
that was in <hi>Abraham</hi> be in vs, <hi>Genes.</hi>
14. 23. that as hee would not take anie
thing of <hi>Melchisedech,</hi> so wee will
not bee a shooe latchet the richer by
the Diuell. If hee offer to make vs
wealthie, let vs answere him; <hi>Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia

either our Sauiour was vnwise in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing

            <p>Our Sauiour (we see) doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refuse the thing: but also giues him
hard words, for making the offer and
motion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For he doth not only confute
him here, by saying, <hi>Scriptum est:</hi> but
he addes words of bitter reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sion,
saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Auoyd Satan.</hi> He might haue
giuen faire words, as hee did before:
but here he seemeth to haue left hys
patience. The reason why hee vvas
more hot in this, than in the former,
is: for that this toucheth the glory of
God, &amp; the redemption of mankinde:
the former Temptations touched but
himselfe in perticular, as the turning
of stones into bread, but for myracle:
and the casting himselfe downe, was
but to trie God, what care hee had of
him: But this so much toucheth the
glorie of God, as he can hold no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
Also, his longing to redeeme
man, caused the same. Neither did he
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:293:101"/>
onelie aunswere the Diuell so: but
when his blessed Apostle, who meant
friendlie to him, mooued him to the
like matter, he rebuked him sharply.</p>
            <p>Two causes there are, wherein
Christ is verie earnest; one in counsell
ministred to him, tending to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payring
of Gods glorie: the other in
practises, tending to the impayring of
Gods Church, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 15. there he was
not onely vehement in woords; but
made a whippe to scourge them out.
And so in the olde Testament, it is
sayd of <hi>Moses, Numb.</hi> 12. 3. that hee
was a meeke man, aboue all the men
of the earth: yet when he came to a
case of Idolatrie, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 19. it is said
he threw the Tables out of his hands,
and brake them. And so farre did he
loose his naturall affection to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and Countrey men, that hee cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a great number of them to bee
slayne.</p>
            <p>And so in a case of the Church,
when <hi>Corah</hi> rebelled, <hi>Numb,</hi> 16. 15.
<pb facs="tcp:293:102"/>
then <hi>Moses</hi> wexed verie angrie: for
<hi>Glorie be to God on high, and peace on
earth,</hi> is the Angells song and ioy, and
the diuels griefe: as on the other side,
the dishonour of God, and dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Church, is the diuells ioy,
and griefe of the Angels.</p>
            <p>Now, besides that hee dooth in
woords rebuke him sharplie, he doth
no lesse in gesture also: as by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

            <p>Now to the Answere: <hi>Scriptum est.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The disputing or decyding of the
Diuells Title: that is, whether the
Kingdomes of the earth were his to
giue or no, Christ standes not vppon;
nor vppon this, whether the Diuell
were a man of his woord or no. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
it might well haue been doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
whether the Diuell be as good as
his woord: his promises are not <hi>Yea</hi>
and <hi>Amen,</hi> as the promises of God
<pb facs="tcp:293:103"/>
are. Wee maie take example by <hi>Eue,</hi>
to whome hee promised, that if they
did eate of the forbidden Frute, that
they should bee lyke Gods: but were
they so indeede, after they had eaten?
No, but lyke the beastes that perish.
And as true it is, that the Kingdomes
are his.</p>
            <p>If the Kingdome of <hi>Israell</hi> had
been at his disposition, wee maye bee
sure <hi>Dauid</hi> should neuer haue beene
King: as well appeareth by the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
hee raysed agaynst him. No, nor
<hi>Ezechias</hi> neyther, of all other hee
would neuer choose such. Wee may
see his good will in <hi>Iob,</hi> chapter se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
verse 7. hee could not onely be
content to spoyle him of all that hee
had, but also hee must afflict his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
and so vpon the <hi>Gergashites</hi> hogs
in the 8. Chapter, and 30. verse of Saint
<hi>Mathew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Kingdomes are none of his,
but they are committed to him in
some sort to dispose, as hee himselfe
saith in the fourth of <hi>Luke,</hi> the 6. vers.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:293:103"/>
Hee hath (as it were) an Aduowson

            <p>God must first put all the <hi>Iob</hi> hath

Officers. So wee see daylie in our

saith, Manie haue <hi>Panem quotidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anum,</hi>
that cannot come by <hi>Da nobis:</hi>
they come not to it by Gods gift: yet
all the interest that the Diuell hath, is
but to present <hi>Pro hac vita tantum.</hi> As
therefore it maye bee true, that in
some sort they maye bee gyuen

will.</p>
            <p>It is God onelie that can say so, for
his onelie they are absolutelie. <hi>The

than the thing is woorth, and restray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the benefite of his graunt with
vniust couenaunts. But Christ goes
not about to aunswere the Diuell that
waye: but by flying to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as to his surest holde. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Dauid</hi> prayes, that his minde

7. vers. 10. and to minister before him.
Hee hath a greater preheminence,
but wee are also heerein partakers of
the diuine nature, 2. <hi>Pet. chapt. 1. ver.</hi>
4. either because wee are fed by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
as <hi>Elias</hi> was, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 19. 5. or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by them, or watched of them.</p>
            <p>But sayth <hi>Esay, chapt. 18. vers.</hi> 28.
<hi>He that beleeueth makes not haste.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Christ was not hastie, but stayed
Gods good time: he would not make
his own bread, but staid till the Angels
ministred vnto him. Then there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
an Angell to comfort hym,
<hi>Luke.</hi> 22. 43.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:293:111"/>This wisedome must wee learne by
holding our tongue, <hi>Iob. chapt. 33. ver.
33.</hi> otherwise one of these two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames
shall wee come to: eyther
<hi>Extremum luctus gaudium occupat,</hi> or
<hi>Extrema gaudii luctus occupat,</hi> sayth
<hi>Barnard. Luke 16. 25.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The world is like <hi>Iaell,</hi> who meetes
<hi>Sisera, Iudg. chapt. 4. ver. 19.</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaynes
him at first verie friendly,
shee allures him to her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and giues him
drinke, and layes him downe: but so
soone as he was a sleepe, shee smites a
nayle into his temples. The world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes
with milke, and ends with a
hammer: but our Sauiours meaning
is cleane contrary. The world first vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth
good wine: &amp; when men haue
well drunke, then that which is worse.
<hi>Iohn chapt. 2. ver. 10.</hi> But Christ hath
kept backe the good wine till nowe,
<hi>chapt. 2. vers.</hi> 9. as <hi>Matthew</hi> sayth,
<hi>chap. 13. vers. 41. The Sonne of man shall
sende foorth hys Angells and they shall
gather out of his kingdome, al things that
offend, and them which doe iniquitie,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:293:111"/>
and shall cast them into a furnace of fire:
there shall bee weeping and gnashing of
teeth. Then shall the iust shine as the
Sunne in the kingdome of theyr Father.</hi>
Our Sauiours methode is, to giue bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
first, and sweete after: wherefore
we are to wish, that heere we may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
affliction, that wee may after bee
crowned by him.</p>
