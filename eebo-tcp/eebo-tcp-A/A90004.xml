            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat at the laſt Aſſizes they with all Loyall Dutie preſented a Petition to your
<hi>Majeſtie,</hi> and another to the Lords and Commons in <hi>Parliament</hi> aſſembled, containing
their humble requeſts for the declaration of ſuch meanes as might take away all diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and produce a bleſſed Union moſt neceſſary to this afflicted Kingdome which then
was, and we are confident yet is the earneſt Prayer and deſire of all in this <hi>Countie</hi> who
are well affected to your Majeſtie, the true <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, and the peace of your
Dominions. And ſince by a Letter from the Speaker of the Houſe of Commons di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to the Sheriffe wee are aſſured that we are accordingly framing their humble deſires to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,
ſuch as chiefly tend to the honour of God, the greatneſſe and proſperitie of your Majeſtie, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
good of the Common-wealth. Yet ſince (moſt gracious Soveraigne) with much ſorrow of heart wee
underſtand that a few Gentlemen of this <hi>Countie</hi> have taken upon them to anticipate theſe demonſtrations
of Dutie, which both Houſes are preparing, and your Majeſties gracious reſolution thereupon in the
name of the Gentry and Commons of the Countie of <hi>Yorke;</hi> whereas (indeed) they were a very ſmall part
of the Gentry onely, as we are informed in a Petition to your Majeſtie directly oppoſite to the Petition
of both Houſes of <hi>Parliament</hi> concetning the removing of the <hi>Magazine</hi> at <hi>Hull,</hi> tending to foment diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
betwixt your Majeſtie, and your great Councell.</p>
            <p>We therefore encouraged by that expreſſion from your Majeſties owne mouth concerning other Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
that you had not gone about to diſcourage them from petitioning in an humble way, and being
moſt aſſured that our loyall affections to your Majeſtie, your Crowne and Dignitie are not inferiour to any
of your Subjects whatſoever, and that wee have better ground and warrant to repreſent the ſenſe of the
Gentry and Commons of <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> then thoſe few Petitioners had; yet are we not poſſeſſed with ſo much
arrogancie as to beleeve that a few amongſt us, or all the Countie together can judge of the fitneſſe where
to diſpoſe that <hi>Magazine,</hi> or of the ſtate and ſafetie of this Kingdome and of your Majeſties Perſon ſo well
as your great Counſell, whoſe judgement we are bound to preferre before all private Counſells, and whoſe
endeavours have given us much aſſurance of their care and fidelitie to the publique, which we doubt not
all tend to the honour, ſatisfaction and greatneſſe of your ſacred Majeſtie and Royall Poſterity.</p>
            <p>And that your Majeſtie would graciouſly apply your ſelfe to all good meanes of Union, that thoſe
Duties which by the Lawes of God and men wee owne (expreſſed in our late Proteſtation) may not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
