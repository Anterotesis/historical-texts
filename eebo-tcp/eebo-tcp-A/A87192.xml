            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1 The Law of God ſaith, <hi>He that will not work, let him not eat:</hi> This would be a ſore ſcourge, and ſmart whip for idle perſons, if Gods Law were ſo executed, that none ſhould be ſuffered to eat, till they had wrought for it (if they were able) this would torment ſuch perſons (both back and belly) more then ten laſhes a day, and ſuch a reſtraint from victuall, would in time drive them to works whether they would or no, tho never ſo ſtubborn; for if ſuch
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117733:3"/>
ſhould be made to faſt that will not work, one or two dayes, before they eat, they will be glad to fall to his or her labour the third day; for hunger will tame the wildeſt Colt, and conſtrain him to come to hand for hey or ſtraw.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The Laws of the Land ſaith, <hi>He that is idle, and may work, and will not, let ſuch be ſent to the houſe of Correction, and there be imployed, and reſtrained from a begging idle life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are other good Laws made againſt incorrigible Rogues, which I will omit to ſpeak of, deſiring thoſe that would know more of them to ſearch the Statutes of <hi>England,</hi> which are very good in ſuppreſſing the idle, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the needy, onely if one thing might be added:</p>
            <p>That no luſty perſon ſhould have the benefit of a Paſſe if he lived abov thirty miles from <hi>London;</hi> the reaſon why I ſpeak of the diſtance of thirty miles, it is becauſe the Cariers come two or three times a week, and a letter from the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Pariſh, and the ſaid Carier that dwells neareſt to the Pariſh to cary it; and the Porter that is ſervant to the Carier, to cary the ſaid letter to the Pariſh where the Begger ſaith he was born, or laſt dwelled, and he to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it to the Conſtable or Collectors for the poor, and they without delay upon a penalty to return anſwer by the firſt or ſecond return of the Carier, and their hands with the hands either of a Juſtice or Miniſter of the Pariſh, of the truth, whether ever any ſuch perſon were born there, or inhabited amongſt them; by this means you will ſoon diſcover much falſhood amongſt beggers, and much care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſenes among Conſtables, in not guiding home the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to their Pariſh, a penalty on them will make them bee carefull; therefore if the Corporation do intend to do the work truly, faithfully, and with advantage to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, they muſt neither take the word of a wandring begger, nor the true ſervice of a careles Conſtable, for they are both ill members to a well-governed Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and will deceive; therefore two letters from the Corporation to the Pariſh where the Begger ſaith he was born, or laſt abode will be very neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> one to know the truth whether ever any ſuch perſon belonged to them,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117733:3"/>
by this means you ſhall have a true account whether the Beggers report be true: The other letter is when the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is ſent away with the Paſſe, to know whether he be come to his Pariſh, if not, you ſhall be ſure then to know what Conſtable was in the fault, that the Begger was not conducted to his Pariſh, ſuch Conſtables being fined, will make others beware, this will be little charge to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, and your work done very judiciouſly with care &amp; prudence; for ſome Beggers may commit ſome miſdemeanor in their Country; therefore it is a ſimple thing to take their word, for they will never tell truth; As for example,</p>
            <p>Suppoſe a Conſtable of <hi>London</hi> ſhould take up a Begger in his Precinct or Pariſh, &amp; ſhould ask him where he was born or laſt dwelt, the Begger ſhould ſay, at <hi>York,</hi> or <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> when as peradventure he was neither born, nor inhabited in any of the foreſaid Cities, and it may be he was never in that Country in all his life, yet upon the bare word of the Begger the Conſtable makes his Paſſe, corrects him, and ſends him away to the place of his birth, or laſt abode, as he ſaith, and when he comes thither, the inhabitants there will own no ſuch perſon, and ſo he muſt be brought back again to the great trouble of the Country, according to this I will give you a preſident.</p>
            <p>A Gentleman who is now one of the Corporation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſtable, a luſty Begger was begging in his Pariſh, he asked him where he was born, he ſaid at <hi>Dover,</hi> he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Beadle to whip him, and made him his Paſſe, and ſent him for <hi>Dover,</hi> when he came thither, the Inhabitants of <hi>Dover</hi> would not receive him, they had none ſuch born there, they ſent him back again to <hi>London</hi> from whence he was ſent; when the Conſtable ſaw him, he admired that the Laws were ſo defect; and he was ſory the Country was ſo much troubled, by carying, and re-carying to no purpoſe; then he asked the Begger where he did ever dwell, he ſaid at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> the Conſtable ſent him away for that place, and what became of him afterwards he could not tell.</p>
            <p>Herein we find it is a trouble to a Commonwealth, that a Conſtable hav no more proof concerning a wandering Rogues birth or abode, but onely his bare word, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117733:4"/>
may lye if he pleaſe, as well as tell truth.</p>
            <p>Conſider in the next place how a careles' Conſtable may prove an ill inſtrument to the Commonwealth; for if a luſty Begger paſſe through the hands of many Conſtables ſafe as he is carying along the Country; yet if at laſt he fall into the hands of a careles Conſtable he can make his eſcape and go into another part of our Nation, and continue ſtill a trouble and a danger to the Commonwealth, for ſome of them are very deſperate and envious; if a Farmer give not them an alms to their own mind, or a croſſe-word, they care no more to ſet his Barn and Ricks of corn on fire, then to light a pipe of Tobacco, ſo deſperate many of them are to do a miſchief by day or by night; wherefore in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion ther's no better way to guide Beggers to their homes then by way of the Carier, for ſome Cariers hav been complained of for bringing boyes and girles, and leave them at <hi>London</hi> upon the charge of this City.</p>
            <p>I conceive a Carier or Wagoner are the fitteſt men to convey Beggers, that dwell about 30 miles from <hi>London,</hi> for Trunk; provided the Pariſh pay the Carier for his paines, and if the Carier or Wagoner do not perform their care for the good of the Commonwealth, let a penalty be laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on them, by this means, the Conſtable will be freed, and the Country eaſed of ſuch perſons that are a peſt and trouble to our Nation.</p>
            <p>And if in caſe a luſty vagrant ſhould ſay he was born a hundred miles or more, not then to have a Paſſe, but rather be kept to work either in the houſe of Correction, or in the Gallies, or clenſing of ſtreets, I mean little narrow places where carts ſeldome come, with ſuch like imployment, till ſuch time they can be ſent to the Engliſh Plantations, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſuch can procure good ſecurity to live orderly.</p>
            <p>I have no more to ſay, but beſeech the Lord that your Lordſhip, with the reſt of the Corporation, may be tender fathers to the honeſt poor, and ſevere to the obſtinate, knowing, as I ſaid before, you have the Law of God, and our Nation to ſtrengthen your hands, and the power of Parliament to countenance you. For which ſhal be the daily prayer of him, who is <hi>Your humble ſervant,</hi> S.H.</p>

            <p>THat which ſets the chiefeſt Diadem upon great perſons, is not ſo much in their birth, and blood Royall, as in their Piety and Charity, ſuch perſons whoſe hearts God hath ſeaſoned with the graces of his holy Spirit, they are of a hyer bloud, then thoſe that are born from Emperors and great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſuch as they are but born of the fleſh, they are not born of the the Spirit: And Chriſt tells us, <hi>If we are not born of the Spirit,</hi> that eternall Royall ſeed, <hi>we ſhall never enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> By this we find <hi>(My Lord)</hi> that there is a neceſsity to ſeek after this ſecond birth, being of the Spirit, &amp; from the Spirit of God, as our firſt birth is of the fleſh, and from the fleſh of men; the firſt birth is a fading birth that ſhall periſh; the laſt birth is a laſting birth that ſhal never periſh, it ſhal never dye, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>viz.</hi> They ſhall never dye in the ſpirit, though they ſuffer death in the fleſh, and our Saviour Chriſt bids his peopl, <hi>Not to fear them that can but kill the body, but are not able to deſtroy the ſoul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> I hear many boaſt of their firſt birth, which is but from ſinfull man at the beſt; but I hear but few in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the other to boaſt or glory any thing in their ſecond, which is from the higheſt birth Royall of all, inaſmuch as the is none greater then he, who is not only called King of Kings, but King of the Saints, that is King of Kings to overpower them, <hi>for they are in hands like Rivers of water,</hi> that have their tydes, who have their flowings and ſwellings, eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117733:5"/>
and fallings, as pleaſeth the Lord; and he is alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the King of Saints, becauſe he is their Governor and Protector; therefore he is not aſhamed to ſay, <hi>I will be your Father, and you ſhall be my children;</hi> and Chriſt his dear Son, is not aſhamed to call them Brethren. By this we find that the Saints, whether rich or poor, noble or ignoble, are in great favour with God and Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And the Apoſtle St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>God loves the poor that are rich in faith;</hi> and the poor ſo qualified, through the grace of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, are in a capacity to hav a right to the hy birth-right of the Royall bloud of Heaven, which is the hyeſt birth and bloud of all: And truly, <hi>My Lord,</hi> whereas God and Chriſt loves the poor, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce when I ſee rich men, and great men love the poor that excell in vertue; And this I muſt ſpeak to the Honor of your Excellency, that both your ſelf, and the Officers of your Army, have been cordiall in propagating the cauſe of the poor, and their miſeries, in that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip upon requeſt of ſome wel-affected, to ſend two or three Letters, ſome of them to the Parliament, and one to the Lord Mayor of the City of <hi>London,</hi> late deceaſt, that they would improve their power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt for the carying on of this good work, That poor children that beg, may hav maintenance, imployment, and godly education; and all ſorts of wandring poor kept under a daily government, whereby God may be glorified, and good peopl hav joy and comfort in it; 'tis a mercy to a Nation when great men are good men, ſeeking to advance Piety and Charity more then their own honors, and we hav cauſe to bles God, that hath made you inſtrumentall for the honor of God, and the good of the poor, and for the continuance of theſe mercies to the Nation: It ſhall be my daily prayer, with the peopl of God, that Piety and Charity may never fail you to your dying day, and that you may then everlaſtingly enjoy that heavenly birth-right, and by bloud Royall ſpoken of before.</p>

Remember how much <hi>Dives</hi> Doggs were kinder to poor <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> then their Maſter, for they came and licked <hi>Lazarus</hi> Soars, when as their Maſter would not give a Penny towards the poor mans Cure, ſo farr in love with his money was he. <hi>But what was the end of his cruelty?</hi> Perpetuall woe and miſery, as the Scripture ſaith; and becauſe he had not a favour to the poor man, he loſt the favour of God.

            <p>The advance of this worke we hope will produce great joy to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and we hope that the Parliament will to their utmoſt ſtand for the honour of God, and the good of the peopl, which conſiſts in piety and charity; that is, by advancing the Goſpell of Chriſt, and ſeeking the peace of the Nation, for ſo in ſeverall Ordinances they have declared to doe.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. They will endeavour the releaſment of poor Priſoners that are not able to pay their hard hearted Creditors, and yet lye in Priſon for a ſmall Debt; and as for ſuch that lye in Priſon and are able to pay, and will not doe it, being the undoing of many a poor man and his Family, which doth occaſion great poverty upon the Nation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They will endeavour to appoint Friend-makers in all great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes of the Nation, that the mighty may not oppreſſe the poor; this is a worke of great concernment, and will prevent much poverty in the Nation, and bring glory to God, and honour to the Parliament: God is angry with oppreſſors, as he was with King <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and it was his end throuwe, and God ſaith, they that oppreſſe the Widdow, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe, the Stranger, the poor, he will take away their Oppreſſors with hornes, and fiſh-hooks, he will not heare their cry in diſtreſſe, but will Scatter them among all Nations, a fearfull judgement will fall on ſuch as neglect to ſettle a ſhort and ſpeedy way to right the poor againſt their oppreſſors; therefore it was a good ſaying of one, <hi>That quick Juſtice makes quiet Kingdomes,</hi> but <hi>Forma pauperis</hi> are oft times tedious to the undoing of many a poore man, and alſo many actions ariſing more from malice then matter, are a meanes to impoveriſh many a poor body.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Corporation appointed by Authority of Parliament for the well ordering of the Poor within the Citty of <hi>London,</hi> and the Liberties, that the honeſt poor who are willing to worke, may be countenanced, and the idle ſuppreſſed; and the ſaid Corporation I hope doth deſire to acquaint all well affected peopl that are willing to advance this pious and charitable worke by their liberall contributions what their intents and purpoſes are (by Gods aſſiſtance) to carry on the foreſaid good worke: And,</p>
            <p>Therefore to take off all jealouſies that none may have the leaſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their fidelity, as well in relation to the preſerving of the ſtock as alſo in performing the good worke ſo long deſired by many good peopl, ſhall be declared as a well wiſher to them in theſe particulars enſuing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They will endeavour that the Lord Mayor may be moved to ſend his precepts to the Marſhalls and Conſtables, and Beadles of the Citty of <hi>London,</hi> to bring all idle perſons to Bridewell and the Workhouſes, and to allow ſomthing to the Officers for every one they ſhall bring to the aforeſaid places; that the Corporation may know how the better to diſpoſe of them, either for Sea or Land.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I hope they deſire an unanimous conjunction with the Governours of Bridewell, <hi>London,</hi> that they may aſſiſt each other by taking up, and imploying to worke all the luſty poor they find begging.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I hope they will endeavour that the ſaid luſty poor be kept hard to worke, and not to depart thence at leaſt, till he or ſhee have beene there a Moneth, unleſſe they can give ſufficient ſecurity to the Corporation and Governours of Bridewell that they will behave themſelves civilly and orderly, leaving off the trade of a begging idle life.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:117733:7"/>4. I hope they will indeavour that all ſuch as are acquitted for petty Fellony may not be ſet at liberty, as formerly they have been, for within a Moneth or leſſe they have fallen to their old courſe of ſtealing, and brought to Priſon againe: therefore that ſuch upon the diſcharge out of Priſon, may be brought to the Houſes of Correction, whether it be <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Weſtminſter, Middleſex,</hi> or <hi>Surrey,</hi> where the party lived, or the theſe committed, or elſe imployed in the Shipps and Buſſes for the fiſhing Trade, the better to make them ſerviceable to the Common-wealth, by reforming their ungodly life.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They will endeavour that ſuch as are incouragable to have po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer from the Parliament to ſend them to the Plantations belonging to the Engliſh, beyond the Seas, to ſee whither God will be pleaſed to turne them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I hope they will take care that poore Children may be taught to write and read two houres in a day, ſo that by that time the Boys come to the age of 12.14. or 16. they will be able to read and write, fit for Apprentices, but ſuch as are quick witted to make Schollars, and accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, or what they delight in, either for Sea or Land.</p>
            <p>And I hope alſo, they will endeavour that ſuch poor that are willing to worke at home with their Children, that they may have <hi>Hempe, Flax, Cotten-wool,</hi> &amp; other materials to work upon at their own dwellings, they leaving a pawn, or bringing a friend for their ſecurity to returne ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls againe to the Steward of the Corporation, and not to ſell it, or pawne it away for Ale and ſtrong Beere, as ſome poor have done their Maſters worke.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I hope they will indeavour to uſe all meanes (ſome of them being Juſtices of the Peace) to prevent ſuch Familys from poverty, who are made poor by common drunken Husbands, ſuch drunkards bring miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and poverty in the Common-wealth in three relations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By it, they make their Familys poor.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By it, they are apt to charge and burthen their Pariſhes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By it, they impoveriſh the plenty of the Nation, by ſpending the plenty of it waſtfully, and ſo threaten a Famine upon us; for two drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards will ſpend more in drunkenneſſe in one night, then will ſerve two moderate men halfe a weeke.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I could wiſh, for the better ſanctifying of the Lords Day, for ſo I call it, eſpecially from Chriſts Reſurrection, becauſe then our enemy death was overcome, and our full redemption wrought, that the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter on every ſuch Sabboath, keepe the Children and others belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Work-houſe, from wandring the Streets and Feilds in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

time by exerciſing his gifts of Prayer, reading of Chapters, ſinging of Pſalmes, Catechiſing them in ſuch a Catheciſme appoynted by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; that Children may be prevented from errors, eſpecially that of Free-will, for a man is not ſaved by his owne works, but the chiefeſt hopes &amp; aſſurancet of his Salvation ſtandeth upon theſe helps enſuing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the free grace of God that pardoneth a ſinner of his ſins; as a mercifull Creditor forgiveth a poor man a Debt, when he hath nothing to pay, as Chriſt makes the compariſon of the Creditor and the two Debtors, that when they had nothing to pay, the Creditor forgave them, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.4. Meaning God the Creditor, and the two Debtors were <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> the <hi>Gentile</hi> was the greateſt Debtor, for he was for a time a Prodigall, yea without God in the World, having no feare of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes, but now the worke of grace by Chriſt Jeſus, hath wrought a great reformation in many a poor <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſoul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As God is the forgiver of ſin, ſo he is the giver of power againſt ſin, that is, by his holy and good ſpirit in converting a ſinner, which makes the Saints to rejoyce and wonder when the ſtrong holds of Satan in a ſinner are throwne downe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Means we are ſaved by faith, that is, beleiving that Chriſt Jeſus was the beſt Sacrifice that ever was offered to take away ſin from ſinners, therefore Chriſt hath gotten him this honour, that he is called the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted Lambe of God that taketh away the ſins of the World, that whoſoever beleiveth on him ſhould never periſh but have everlaſting life.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Meanes of Salvation is a mans works, where God hath given him ſome meaſure of his ſpirit, for to act. Therefore a man muſt be carefull not to deny his ſpirit by deſpiſing it; nor he muſt not greive the ſpirit, nor quench the ſpirit, if any doe, God will be angry with ſuch, for he hath made man a rationall Creature: therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, we are the workmanſhip of God, created unto good works; yet we are to know, that without Chriſt we can doe nothing that is good, no more then a body can live, when the ſpirit of life is departed from him; theſe are ſpeciall things for a School-maſter to inſtruct, and ſeaſon Children with, on Sabboath-days. Alſo the reading of good Sermons are very profitable, which I deſire may conſiſt of theſe heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Sermon concerning the holy Trinity, in their offices and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, needfull to be knowne in theſe erring times, for ſome deny a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ſome deny Chriſt, and ſome deny a unity or ſpirituall union.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Of the excellency of patience that makes a man intire.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Of contentedneſſe in a low condition, and affl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="9">9. Of the excellency of truth, which will caſt out of a man, lying and ſtealing.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Of the excellent Joys of Heaven, and chiefly wherein, <hi>Viz.</hi> In be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the beauty of God and Chriſt, as a Bridegroome delights in the faire beauty of his Bride, above all her riches.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The horror of Hell, and chiefly wherein, <hi>Viz.</hi> The loſſe of the glorious preſence of God, and his love and favour; this is a hell beyond the unquenchable fire. The Lord deliver us from it.</p>

            <p>The work of well-ordering the poor is a rare work, and by it three excellent things will be produced, toward a good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Gods honor will be ſet up, when that that is good is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.</p>

will ſtand for, againſt all their enemies, and he will make their enemies to be at peace with them.</p>
            <p>But as for ſuch that are enemies to this good work, either by oppoſing it in their words, and works, or by ſtarving it with their poor and ſmall charitys, I fear God hath a curſe for them here, or a wo for them hereafter, <hi>When Chriſt ſhall ſay, Go ye curſed into everlaſting fire prepared for the Devill, and it is angels:</hi> And Chriſt will ſay to ſuch, <hi>Inaſmuch as ye have not don it to the poor, ye have not don it to me:</hi> Such oppoſers of charitabl good works, when they ſhall com upon their death-beds, they will then wiſh they had given half their eſtates with <hi>Zacheus,</hi> that they could then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the love of a Chriſt, and the happineſs of a <hi>Zacheus,</hi> that ſalvation might com unto their houſe, as it did unto his; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wiſh all rich men that deſire to obtain the love of a Chriſt, to make their hands and their eys, their firſt executors, becauſe their laſt executors may deceive them, as ſom have don.</p>
            <p>Conſider, if children are kept under government and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are the fitter for Tradeſmen, &amp; others, and ſo therby, made ſerviceabl to the Commonwealth, ſo that the loſs of 200<abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> is the preſerving of 100 children from ruin: therefore we conclude, if the City of <hi>London</hi> ſhould loſe 1000<abbr>

               </abbr> 
               <hi>per annum</hi> in this work, yet they would gain by it, in the preſervation of 500 children, and more; for if children are not kept under a government, they will in time grow to a generation of ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wretches, having no fear of God before their eys, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a diſhonor to God, and a burden to the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>Therefore let us judge ſeriouſly, which will be the greateſt loſs, either mony or peopl to a Commonwealth? <hi>viz.</hi> whether 500 children ſhould periſh yeerly, rather then the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> ſhould loſe 1000 <abbr>

                  <item>2 To teach the children to read &amp; write, 2 hours in a day, one in the forenoon, the other in the afternoon, the reſt of the day to work</item>

            <p>When God ſhall be pleaſed to bring this Government, then rich and poore, affected with goodneſſe ſhal ſay, <hi>Happy art thou O</hi> England <hi>in this thy Reformation, and bleſſed be thy God for it.</hi>

            <p n="3">3 The office of the Cook or Sutler, to provide ſuch proviſion for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as the Corporation ſhall appoint.</p>
            <p n="1">1 By taking care, that all ſuch proviſion that ſhall be given weekly by well diſpoſed people, for the comfort of poor children, whether it bee Bread from Bakers, Beer and Broth from Taverns Innes, &amp; others, or what elſe any ſhall provide, for the maintenance and upholding this good worke.</p>
            <p n="2">2 For his better livelyhood, that he provide Bread and Beer, and ſuch like for the comfort of poor people that work in the houſe, for they will be glad to have it nigh them, that they may not be hindred of their work: beſides, the having of it by ſmall quantities, farthings and halfe penny worths, as they have need.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the cheifeſt things, that theſe three officers are to act, for the glory of God, the honour of the Corporation, and the comfort of the poor, that none may periſh for want of bread, as many have done of late; witneſſe ſome about <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> that lived upon Dogs and Cats theſe deer and hard times; others upon Beaſts blood and Brewers graines boyled together, and the poor woman that killed her child, and dyed for it the laſt Seſſions 1649. upon her exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſhe confeſt extream need and feare of famine occaſioned it.</p>
            <p>To conclude, for the better releife of the poor, it was well obſerved of one, who ſaid, that <hi>England</hi> had many hundred of Acres of waft and barren lands, and many thouſands of idle hands, if both theſe might be improved, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by Gods bleſſing would grow to be a richer Nation then it is now by far.</p>
            <p>A Parliament power would do much towards this work, to make it generall throughout the Nation, by cauſing all planting of Tobacco to be thrown down in <hi>England,</hi> which is a hinderance to the poor Engliſhmen beyond the Seas, and a wrong to the cuſtom, if they ſell it in other Countries for want of vent here, that ſuch lands may be imployed in ſowing Hemp, and Flax, and Roots, and planting of trees for fruit and fuel, all which would be a great ſuccour to the poor, as well to imploy them, as releive them; the Parliament have intentions to make this good worke of imploying and releiving the poor, generally throughout the Nation. The great God of heaven is able to make them to act and perform it for a generall good.</p>
