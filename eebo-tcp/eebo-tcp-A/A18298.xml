            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe 8. of Octob. being Saterday wee ſet ſayle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 3 of the clocke in the afternoone with a wind at north north eaſt.</p>
            <p>Vpon Sonday the 9. about 6 of the clocke in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, we fell with my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> my Vice-Admirall and thoſe shippes that were put into <hi>Famouth</hi> with him, and about 9 in the ſame morning, we diſcouered 7 ſayle that were Dutch shippes loaden with ſalt, the wind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued faire enough for vs all that day, to lye our courſe and till 12 at night. This day inſtructions were ſent to all the Admiralls, and to other Officers, and to diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shippes.</p>
            <p>The 10 being Monday we were becalmed.</p>
            <p>On Tewſday the 11 in the morning I called a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell for the ſetling of inſtructions for a Sea fight, as by the 7. and 10. Artikle contained in them may plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare viz:</p>
            <p n="7">
               <hi>7. Art.</hi> If the Enemies approach be in ſuch ſort as the Admirall of the Dutch &amp; his squadron or my Vice-Admirall of the fleet and his squadron may haue oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to begin the fight it shall bee lawfull for them ſo to doe vntill I come vſing the forme method and care foreſaide.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <hi>10. Art.</hi> If any shippe or shippes of the Enemies doe breake out or flye, the Admirall of any squadron that shall happen to be on the next, and moſt convenient place for that purpoſe shall ſend out a competent nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the fitteſt shippes of his squadron to chaſe, aſſault, and take ſuch shippe or shippes breaking out, but no shippe shall vndertake ſuch a chaſe without the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of the Admirall or at leaſt the Admirall of his squadron.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe it was ordred that 5 men should be put to a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8057:3"/>
meſſe with the allowance formerly giuen for 4 and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents directed to all the fleete to that ende.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday the 12 about 7 in the morning the winde came to north north weſt with faire weather, it ſerued well till 6 in the euening, the wind increaſing ſo much that it was not ſayle-worthy, yet being large we bore our foreſayle and ſpritteſayle. The Sea grew ſo high that we towed our long boate in peeces, and loſt her, and the loſſe of long boates was generall, I thinke all within 2 houres one of another, ſo that there was not one ſaued through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole fleete, and one Catch was ſunke, another by misfortune comming fowle of a shippe was likewiſe caſt away with 3 of her men, the reſt were ſaued, many shippes were in danger almoſt to deſpaire, the long Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert of <hi>Ipſhwich</hi> was drownd with 138 Land-men, 37 Sea-men, the Land-Captaines loſt in the wrack were Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher, &amp; Hackett a Scotch Captain, and Gurling the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the shippe.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe generall loſſes there was no shippe in her owne particuler that did not ſuffer more or leſſe in this ſtorme by leakes, loſſe of maſts, and by caſualties, and the like.</p>
            <p>In this Tempeſt we had experience of the Anne Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all her ſelfe, her maſtes grewe looſe, the maine maſt was in danger of rowling ouer board, two of her greateſt pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of 5000 weight a peece broke looſe in the Gunners roome, the danger was partly by the negligence of the Officers, that did not ſee carefully to the fitting of theſe things while we lay in Harbour, she would not Hul at all.</p>
            <p>The ſeparation cauſed by this tempeſt was ſo greate that on Fryday the 14 at noone, we ſawe but one shippe of the whole fleete, this day the ſtorme began to ceaſe. Then we made obſervations, and found we were in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8057:3"/>
latitude of 44 and 8 minutes, and after recouered 20 ſayle of shippes. The winde continued faire, and large with a gaile running ſome 7. leagues a watch, we ſteared away with a short courſe ſtaying for the reſt of the fleete.</p>
            <p>On Saturday the 15. about 9 in the morning, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered more that made 33. at noone we were in the height of 42 and 6 minutes.</p>
            <p>On Sonday the 16 bearing to the north eaſt, we ſteared away ſoutheaſt and by eaſt to gaine the shoare, at noone we found our latitude 39 and 54 minutes. The ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erne Cape then being by computation ſouth eaſt, I gaue order to ſome shippes, to goe and looke out for prizes, and diſcouery, and to returne in the afternoone. Now we began to make ready for extraordinary fight, and gaue the ſame order to thoſe that were with me, and the reſt, as by my generall inſtructions vnder my hand may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
            <p>The wind ſtill continued north eaſt, and the 17 on Monday we were in 38 and 48 minutes, from the toppe was diſcouered land, which was the Rocke of from <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> bearing eaſt and by north ſome 14 leagues from vs, I ſent now forth againe to diſcouer the Cape, with order not to diſcouer themſelves, and to come backe againe with intelligence, this day we had a chaſe, but miſſed it.</p>
            <p>Tueſday the 18 at noone our height was 37 and 36 minutes. This day I called a councell for the better reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing what courſe to hold for reuniting the fleete much ſeperated by the late ſtorme.</p>
            <p>This day the Captaines brought in the ſeuerall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of theire defects, as <hi>Sir Beuerley Newcombe</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Dreadnaught that the vpper beames had been broken, and did in fowle weather giue way, and the ſides of the ship opening receaued in ſo much water, that she
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8057:4"/>
was not able to ſubſiſt, Sir William Saint Leger writte a lettre that he ſuſpected the plague in his shippe, but it pleaſed God it proued not to be ſo.</p>
            <p>This day I gaue eſpeciall order to all the Captains, and Maiſters preſent to keepe more neare together, and to haile theire Admirall euery morning reprouing theire former negligence, and miſorder in that kinde, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe them theire orders, which should haue been giuen according to the date, but we were hindred by the ſtorme, wryting thus.</p>
            <p>The ſmall time we haue beene at Sea hath made me take notice of your diſorderly ſayling from your Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls of the ſeuerall ſquadrons you may perceaue how the Dutch squadron keepe themſelues entire, and apart. This is therefore to require you to fall into your owne squadron to attend ſuch directions as shall come from your Admirall and not to depart without licence from him, or his Officers to make one entire body, to ſayle in the day time in faire and cleare weather a league or more from anothers squadron, and towards night to drawe neare, to followe lights in your ſeuerall places, and to take an eſpeciall care that you doe not chaſe, but vpon a great poſſibilitie for hindring our ſpeede or looſing of time while the wind is faire, and that you in the day time beare all the ſayle you can to bring vs to the place deſired, and if any chaſe, it shalbe 2 or 3 of the beſt ſaylors in your squadron. Dated the 11 of Octob. Commanding them to pervſe theire other Artickles euery day that they might be expert in them.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday the 19 in the morning we were in the height of the Cape, and diſcouered 11 ſayle of shippes, which we chaſed thinking they had beene enemie, but they proued to be of our owne, being the Vice-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8057:4"/>
my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> alſo this day we diſcouered about 40 ſayle more which had loſt vs in the ſtorme, being my Lord <hi>Denbigh,</hi> my Lord de la <hi>Ware,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time my Lord of <hi>Denbigh</hi> mett with a ſmall Caruell a <hi>Portugall</hi> that came from <hi>Terceras</hi> we tooke him to haue beene our diſcouerer for the Enemie. but he was only driuen by the ſtorme from the <hi>Terceras</hi> going to an Iſland not farre diſtant called <hi>Gratioſa</hi> he told vs the plate fleete was not come, but that 5 Carrickes paſſed by that waye bound for <hi>Lisbon</hi> ſome 14 dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time, but that one of them was ſunke, if we had come ſooner out, they could not haue eſcaped vs.</p>
            <p>We vnderſtood by thoſe that came with my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> that they made fiers along the Coaſts, and vp the Countrie which when we drew nigher we diſcouered.</p>
            <p>Thurſday the 20 I called a Counſell and lay all day by the lee to gather our shippes together that were miſſing. The buſineſſe of the Counſell was how to put into Saint Lucas according to the intent of a Counſell held at <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> where his Majeſtie was preſent who vpon the doubtfullneſſe there of the reſolution thought good to referre it to our conſideration vpon the place when wee should be arriued vpon better inquirie of the conuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies &amp; diſaduantages both for going into the Harbour &amp; landing our Armie. It was deliuered by the opinion of moſt of the Maiſters that the Hauen of S. Lucas is ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as it is hard and dangerous both for the going in and comming out eſpecially for shipps of burthen as his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties are that they could not paſſe in nor out, but only in ſpring tides, in calmes ſeaſons, and with fauoring windes nor ride ſafe all weathers without the Bay. And it was obſerued by others: that the moſt part of the Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the fleete will hardly aduenture to carrie theire
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8057:5"/>
shipps in or out at Saint Lucas in the beſt tydes and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for want of perfect knowledge of the ſands and shoales that are there, and the right vſe of the landmarkes whereby that Pott is to be gained and quitted in ſafetie. Beſides it was feared that if we should put the whole fleete into ſuch a ſtraight, we should be more apt to be blocked vp by our Enemies then to annoy them, neither could any shippe come ſpeedily out to haue encontred with the plate fleete our cheefe deſigne. Then I demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded both of the Sea Captains &amp; Maiſters why they could not ſpeake of this difficulties before his Maieſtie. Their anſwere was, it is now in the deapth of winter &amp; ſtormy, and that they did tell his Maieſtie that it was a Barrd Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and dangerous to all men, eſpecially to thoſe that had not often paſſed it, and that being vpon the place they could conſider more perticulerly vpon the difficulties then diſcourſe of it when they were farre of. So that I could ſay no more to them, being I was no great Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and that I was ſtricktly tyde to theire advice that did profeſſe the Sea. Where vpon it being propounded by Sir Sam: Argall that Saint Mary Porte neare the Bay of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and not farre diſtant from Saint Lucas was a lowe shoare and more fitt for the landing of our men then any place about Saint Lucas (for we could find none there) and that our shippes might haue good riding there out of the danger of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and that from thence we might march to Saint Lucas by land, which was not 12 miles diſtant.</p>
            <p>There vpon it was reſolued and ordred by the advice of the Councell of Warre that the whole fleete should forthwith beare into the Bay of <hi>Cadiz</hi> &amp; that the whole fleete should ancker before Saint Mary Porte, as the fitteſt place to land in, and the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Vice-Admirall
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:8057:5"/>
is aſſigned with his squadron to anckor firſt, and to leaue birth ſufficiently for the reſt of the fleete, and that my ſelfe, and the Dutch Admirall should anckor next, that I might the better giue directions both to the Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall and Reare-Admirall who anckored ſome what short of me by order, to guard the whole fleete and to giue warning vpon all occaſions if any Enemie should approach.</p>
            <p>Fryday the 21 we ſtood according to directions, the wind ſcanted vpon vs all that day, about 8 or 9 of the clocke at night the wind shifted weſterly, we ſtrucke a hull (for that we could not put to leeward) till towards day, which appearing we ſett ſayle, and had a ſight of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado</hi> ouer <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and bore in accordingly with a good ſaile the wind being betweene the weſt ſouth weſt and the north weſt.</p>
            <p>Saterday the 22 after this, reſolution was taken, I gaue order as before when we diſcouered the Rocke, that euery shippe should breake downe their Cabines and cleare theire shippe of all impediments and to be ready to fight vpon all occaſions according to their generall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions giuen them to that purpoſe, for that we were to enter in at the Bay of <hi>Cadiz</hi> and knew not what ships might be there, and becauſe of the tyde that ſerued vs to goe into the Bay, I wrote to my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> to make all the haſt he could, and to hoyſe vp all his ſayles that we might ſaue as much of the tyde as we could, and that I would againe commaund his ſquadron to follow him, which I did but I muſt confeſſe they went the moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardly that euer I did ſee men, for they did not hoyſe vp all their ſayles as they were commanded. Seeing the Vice-Admirall packe on all his, I followed as faſt as I could, and cryed out to them to hoyſe their ſayles &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaunce,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8057:6"/>
ſome of them increaſed theire ſayles, but not much. But I could neuer learne by all the Seamen in my shippe to know thoſe shippes that were ſo backward and when I did inquire, euery man excuſed himſelfe ſaying it was not he, and our buſineſſe grew ſo hott that I could not immediately inquire after it any further not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the shippes one from another.</p>
            <p>This day we tooke 3 shippes that came from Saint <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi> which Captain <hi>Raymond</hi> brought in loaden with ſalt, wines, wooll, figges, raiſins &amp; ſome cutchaneale &amp;c. who ſaid they belonged to <hi>Hamburgh</hi> and to <hi>Calis,</hi> but were conceaued by much probabilitie to be <hi>Dunkerks</hi> goods.</p>
            <p>In our approach into the Bay we diſcouered 18 or 20 ſayle of great and ſmall shippes at anckor in the Roade which proued to be the Admirall of <hi>Naples</hi> and 5 or 6 more that brought men and munition into <hi>Cadiz,</hi> 6 other of the shippes came from <hi>Brazeile</hi> &amp; 5 or 6 more men of warre and Marchants shippes, we made ready and prepared our shippe for fight, but ſuch was the ſmalneſſe of the Gayle that it was 2 or 3 of the clocke before we could gett within the <hi>Porcas,</hi> alſo there came out of Saint Mary Port 15 ſayle of Gallyes whereof the Duke of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandina</hi> was commaunder; 5 of the Gallyes were by our shippes that came in forced to retire againe to Saint Mary Port, the other 10 recouered <hi>Puntall</hi> amongſt their shippes and preſently towed them vp toward Port <hi>Royall.</hi> And I was not ſo farre of, but I could ſee the Spanish shippes that did cutt their Cables by the haulſe, shoote firſt at my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and he at them, ſo likewiſe did my Lord of <hi>Valentia</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Chudeleigh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now when all the fleete came to anckor according to the orders that were giuen them, &amp; that we did ſee theſe shippes fledde from vs. I immediately called a generall
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8057:6"/>
counſell to looſe no time for it was late, and the opinion of the Seamen was, that if I could but cleare the 2 fortes to ſecure the fleete to paſſe in ſafety, I might haue a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way to vndertake the shipping. Then I demaunded of them what kind of forts they were, they told me that 20 Colliers with ſome of the Dutch would beate them to duſt before the morning, where vpon I &amp; the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell being caled did preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly reſolue that the ships warned and commaunded should goe vp to the forts, and that they should receaue directions from my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> that had order from me, and becauſe of that I ſent Sir <hi>Michel Geere</hi> for the better diſpatch to warne 20 of the next shippes that hee could meete with all, and to bring me theire names in writing, and Sir <hi>Thomas Loue</hi> offred him a man to goe with him to write them downe to be the more ſure of them, becauſe I meant, if they had failed in a ſeruice of that importance to haue punished them ſeuerely. But he neuer came backe to me nor ſent me any names, and when I ſent to him to know the reaſon, he told the meſſenger, he had warned them, but he knew not theire names.</p>
            <p>After this I ſent Sir <hi>Thomas Loue</hi> to aduance the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shippes and to ſee whether the Reare-Admirall had anckored in a convenient place for the ſecuritie of the fleete, &amp; to haue an eye vpon the Gallies that they should do no harme in the night, although there are ſome that are of opinion that they might haue beene ſtopped, but it ſeemes they are no great Seamen, or els that few of the Sea-men did vnderſtand how to ſtoppe them, for when Gallies can rowe againſt the wind I would faine know how shippes can do them any harme, or intercept them, and when they haue the wind with theire oares what shippe can fetch them vp, ſo that he that ſaith this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:8057:7"/>
ought firſt to learne thus much before he giue his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he likewiſe had order from me to fruſtrate all ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems of the Enemie which might happen by ſending fier amongſt our shipps, and to commaund and admonish the reſt of the commaunders to repaire to their ſeuerall places.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time I ſent Sir <hi>Francis Carew</hi> (who was ready vpon all occaſions) to the Dutch Admirall to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that 5 of his shippes might goe vp for the battering of <hi>Puntall,</hi> and that I would ſend twentie of the fleete to aſſiſt them, which he graunted willingly, and ſent them forthwith, it was by this time darke night and we could heare the Report of the Ordnance, and ſee the fier giuen on both ſides and knew no other but that the twentie shippes warned by Sir <hi>Michel Geere</hi> were all there at this, but ſending to ſee what was done, word was brougt to vs that there was none there but the 5 Dutch shippes which shewes the difference of men practiſed at Sea, and of them that are not, I was much troubled here at.</p>
            <p>Now vpon this neglect of Sir <hi>Michel Geere</hi> I did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly giue order that 40 ſayle of shippes should be liſted by name and commaunded to vſe all diligence to gett vp to the fort betimes in the morning as by the liſt may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare and by this warrant to that purpoſe viz:</p>
            <p>The Admirall doth ſtraightly charge &amp; commaund all the commaunders of theſe shippes vpon ſight of this or billets of it, that they be ready with theire shippes in the morning betimes to aſſaile the fort of <hi>Puntall</hi> to land men according to directions and to purſue the shippes of the Enemie with all diligence, and to follow ſuch directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therein as shalbe giuen to ſuch as shalbe appointed in that kind. Aboard the Anne Royall at 10 of the clocke at night 22 of Octob. 1625.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:8057:7"/>More ouer I made choice &amp; appointed 8 commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders out of the reſt, that if any of the Kings shippes fall of, they might take theire place to lead vp the other ships as well againſt the fort as the Spanish shippes &amp; Gallies.</p>
            <p>Afterwards Sir <hi>Thomas Loue</hi> and I did the ſame night aduiſe with certaine Captains and Maiſters beſt experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in that place, to perſwade them to conduct vp the shippes, which they would not vndertake neither had any of them been at <hi>Port Royall</hi> or were perfect in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell which was ſomewhat difficult for want of water.</p>
            <p>On Sonday the 23 I was vp by 3 of the clock in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning &amp; after we had all receaued the communion aboard the Anne Royall which was a weeke before ordained by the chaplaines, I was vnwiling to differ ſo good a motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being that it hindred no time and as ſoone as day came on, I commanded my Maiſter to carry vp the ship to <hi>Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,</hi> his anſwere was that there was not water enough to carrie her vp. Where vpon to looſe no time I tooke Barge with Sir <hi>Thomas Loue</hi> and thoſe Gentlemen that were with me in my shippe, and went from shippe to shippe crying out to them to aduance to <hi>Puntall</hi> for shame, and vpon paine of theire liues, and thoſe I could not ſpeake with all, I ſent Sir <hi>Thomas Loue</hi> to, with as ſtrickt a commaund as I could deuiſe, and finding ſome of them not very haſtie. I ſaw no other way to bring them vp but by example, it made me goe to my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his shippe, and gaue directions to his Lordship for his shippe to goe vp, &amp; to bring her as nigh <hi>Puntall</hi> as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly we could, telling my Lord that if we did not aduance, the reſt would come at leaſure, for that I did not ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny make haſt. Where vpon my Lord commaunded Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Argall to hoyſe ſayle and as ſoone as we came nigh the fort they shotte our shippe twice together thorough
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8057:8"/>
and thorough the very midſt of her within a foote at leaſt of the water and miſt no shippe they shott at, and kild as many commaunders of ours beſides ſoldiers as we killed in all of theirs.</p>
            <p>The fort of <hi>Puntall</hi> that I was told would be beaten to duſt in a night did receaue 1700 shott and not one ſtone remoued out of his place, and we endeauored to gett vp all the shippes we could, that we might make the more haſt to fire the Spanish shippes, that were retired to Port <hi>Royall</hi> according to my inſtructions that I gaue the night before to batter <hi>Puntall</hi> and to fier the ships at once as I haue shewne before.</p>
            <p>But I could not gett the shippes to come vp, and moſt of the Kings shippes were on ground, and it was almoſt night before the fort would yeild, at lenght it was not to the shippes that it yeilded but to the Landmen, and if the Captain had no more reaſon then I could perceaue he deſerued to haue beene hanged for yeilding that which we could neuer haue gorten without cannon, and we had no meanes to land Ordnance (wanting our long boates. And I dare ſay it before the beſt Soldier, that for the bigneſſe of 100 foote square, I did neuer ſee a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger nor better built, nor ſuch a kinde of ſtone, that no bullett did it much harme. We plaid vpon it with all the shipps excepting the Reare-Admirals squadron till about 2 or 3 of the clocke in the afternoone. I finding that it would not batter and our honours were much ingaged, I told my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and ſome other Officers that were there in the shippe that we should looſe our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and neuer gett the forte if ſome men were not lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to take it in by a <hi>Scallado</hi> and with <hi>Granadoes.</hi> I could find no man to contradict it. And Sir <hi>Iohn Burgh</hi> being next to me, I deſired him that he would vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8057:8"/>
the ſeruice, he told me very willingly, and deſired his owne Regiment, I told him that would ſpend to much time, and that it were better to take ſome of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies next him to make the more haſt with which he was contented ſo, I ſent to gett ſome 10 or 11 Companyes, he aſked me what directions I would giue. I directed him to land them as free from the canon as he could he made anſwer that directly to the Sco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (as he thought) was beſt. I then replied that I left it to his diſcretion for that I knew him to be diſcreete enough, &amp; that he muſt act it. But he ſending ſome Officers to land which were loſt by that direction it was found the way that I had ſpoken of was the better. When he had landed his men very well, and had advaunced towards the land there did aduaunce ſome horſe and foote with whome he sker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midged and put them to retreate and afterwards advaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced towards the forte, when the ſoldiers in the forte whereof <hi>Don Franciſco de Buſtiamente</hi> was Captain ſaw our men aduaunce and theire men retire they hung out a white flagge or hand kercher, there vpon we parlied, and ſo the fort was yeilded vpon ordinarie conditions and we Maiſters of it. Wherein was, only 8 peeces of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce whereof the Dutch had two, and we 6, and 10 or 15 Barrells of powder. This day was wholly ſpent in bringing vp the shippes, landing our men and taking the forte, ſo that nothing could be done againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies shippes which was theire aduantage. It was about 9 of the clocke before the forte was ours at which time I tooke my leaue of my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and went home aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring our ſelues that the shippes were our owne being Maiſters of the forte.</p>
            <p>Vpon Monday the 24 I went early in the morning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 6 of the clocke to my Lord of <hi>Denbigh,</hi> and ſpake
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8057:9"/>
thus to him: you are no ould Seaman, and therefore I would deſire you to make all the haſte you can, and to gather all the Seamen togither that are of the counſell &amp; others, and to deſire them to thinke of rhe beſt way how they might fier, or diſtroy thoſe ships of the Enemy, that fled from vs. There vpon he came backe with me, and promiſed to goe about that buſineſſe without any delay, which he did very carefully, and punctually, that was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my inſtructions, to giue preheminence to Seamen in Sea buſiineſſe, and vnto Landmen in land af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.</p>
            <p>Now I made no account but as they ſaid the shippes were our owne, and that becauſe they made ſo ſleight of it, they knew more then I did, how to ſett vpon them.</p>
            <p>Then I thought it not amiſſe to land ſome compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to ſecure Sir <hi>Iohn Burgh,</hi> to preuent that neither the Enemy from the Towne, nor from the continent might ingage them vnwares. As alſo that the shippes might be the more empty, and free to aſſault the Spanish ships and to refresh the Soldiers, and for taking in of fresh water; but with no deſigne of Cadiz, for that it was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to his Maieſtie before we went, that it was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary fortified, (as we found it when we came to viewe it) &amp; I haſtened this preparation the rather that our ships might ſpeedely putt in execution what courſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the Seamen should reſolue vpon. So order was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen preſently that all the troopes in my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his ſquadro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; in mine, were immediately landed but few of the Landmen of the Rere-Admiralls squadron were landed at all; for they were kept (that if we could haue found any meanes to be had for vndertaking of <hi>Cadiz</hi>) to be landed. After this moſt of the Land Officers of the feeld mett at the fort, and I tooke order for victualls
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8057:9"/>
for the Soldiers on land, to be brought to <hi>Puntall</hi> but I was much troubled at ſome of the Officers, that the Sold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iers with Sir <hi>Iohn Burgh</hi> had not carried biskett in their knapſackes, being that I gaue a generall order to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant Major Generall, that when any Soldier should land they should bring victualls with them, for that the knap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſackes were ordained for nothing els, as I did keepe mine owne order my ſelfe, for that all my voluntary Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſeruants did carry their victualls in knapſacks, yea not ſo much as my chaplin, but carried his knapſacke.</p>
            <p>The Officers of the feeld, and all conſidering what was to be done, and taking care for the prouiſion of the ſoldiers, Sir <hi>Michel Gere</hi> comes in, and tould the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell; the Enemy with many troopes were marching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, vpon this I tould the reſt of the counſell, if it were true, it would be more aduantage for vs to meete them farre off from the towne, then to ſtay till the towne and they should fall vpon vs both waies, where vpon euery one made himſelfe ready, and I gaue order that the troopes should be ready to march, for that we had newes by one that did ſee them march. There vpon we marched, but when we had marched ſome 6 miles or there abouts, I called to ſome of the Counſell of warre, &amp; tould them; it ſeemes that this alarme is falſe, and as the Counſell of warre was gathering together, came in my Lord of <hi>Valentia</hi> whoe rid before to diſcouer, and tould vs, that the Enimy was marching, then I commaunded the troopes to aduance, but no complaint made of any want of victuall, but by thoſe that landed with Sir <hi>Iohn Burgh,</hi> whoe in regard of that wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t had order to goe back. For they that would haue carried any, might haue had enough, there being ſtore at the fort, beſides the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall order I gaue, that no Soldier should land without
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:8057:10"/>
victualls. Within 2 miles of the Bridge, the Soldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to crye, they had neither meate, nor drinke, and the day they marched was a very hott daye, here I rode before to quarter the Army, and to diſcouer the avenues, and paſſages, and as I came backe one came to me and told me, there was ſomme wine in a ſeller, and that if it were deliuered out in order, it would ſerue to refresh the Soldiers that wanted both bred, and drinke. But little did I thinke that all the Cuntry was full of wine, &amp; knowing of no more then of one ſeller, I gaue order, that euery Regiment should haue a proportion of wine, which I did ſee deliuered with mine owne eyes. If euery Officer had ſeene it as well diſtributed as they were directed, it would haue done them good, not harme. But when other Magazines were diſcouered (for the prouiſion for the Weſt-Indies was rhere) there was no keeping of the Soldiers from it, but the beſt way we could deuiſe, was to ſtaue it, and lett the wine runne out, which Sir <hi>Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iam</hi> Saint <hi>Leger</hi> the Sergeant Major Generall beſtowed ſome time about; But when this was done, the Soldiers neuertheleſſe would drinke it in the ſand, &amp; dirty places.</p>
            <p>Now this diſorder, made vs of the Counſell of warre to conſider that ſince the going to the Bridge was no greate deſigne, but to meet with the Enemy, &amp; to ſpoile the Cuntry, neither could we victuall any men, that should be left there, and that the Gallies might land as many men as they would to cutt them off, &amp; that when my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> tooke <hi>Cadis, Coniers Cliſſord,</hi> was tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Sir <hi>Francis Vere</hi> (which is yet to be ſeen in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe written by himſelfe) to miſtake his directions, that were giuen him, to goe no farther then the troate of the land fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Town, which was not aboue 2 miles, where he might be ſeconded and relieued &amp; be ready to relieue others, but he went to the Bridge 12 miles off, ſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:8057:10"/>
there was no neceſſity, this diſorder happening and want of victualls, we reſolued to turne back againe, as wee did, and when the troopes were within 3 or 4 miles of the Town; I rode before to ſee if that which the ſlaues tould (which rendred them ſelues to me) were true; that the Bullworks were high, the town walls flankerd, and the dich was 20 foote deepe, cutt out of the Rock, but that I could not ſee, the Bullworks, and walls I did, which when <hi>Cadiz</hi> before was taken there was no ſuch thing. And I haue ben ſo long at the warrs, that I dare vndertake, that they whoe thinke that <hi>Cadiz</hi> was to be taken cannot tell how to come to it, without canon, if there were none but women in it.</p>
            <p>For in our profeſſion, there are but 3 waies to take any Town, the firſt by ſurprize, the ſecond by aſſault, &amp; the third by approches, &amp; we were no waies able to attempt it by any of theis meanes. Now after I had viſited as much as I could, the troopes being quartred (which I did my ſelfe) I deſired the Colonells to comme together, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre what was beſt to be donne, and to lett them know that now the troopes were quartred in a fitt place, if any out of his experience could thinke there were any way for vs to vndertake the Town of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> it would be a great honour to vs, and a ſeruice acceptable to our King, &amp; State. When I propounded this, we were all on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back ſtanding round in a Ring, but I found not one man of that opinion, that it was feaſeable, ſo wee quartred that night.</p>
            <p>On Tueſday the 25 in the morning there was a motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from Sir <hi>Tho: Loue,</hi> that if we would march ſome 4 or 5 miles diſtant we might recouer ſome boates, that would ſerue our turne in ſteed of long boats, which we condiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended vnto for our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity, &amp; that the Enemy should ſee, that we did not march back again to shunne them, ſo
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:8057:11"/>
we marched forthwards againe, &amp; brought thoſe boates to the water ſide, and made as much ſpoile as it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for vs to doe, of maſts, netts, and other prouiſions for fishing and shipping for the Weſt-Indies fleet to a good valewe, eſpecially the maſts that would haue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the greateſt shippe the King hath. Then we retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to our old quarter.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday the 26 in the morning, the Colonells mett at <hi>Puntall</hi> to conſider what we were beſt to doe; but before we did any thing, I ſent to Sir <hi>Samuell Argall,</hi> to knowe what he had done touching the fiering of the Enemies shippes, and that it ſeemed very ſtrange to me that the exploite which was ſo eaſy, was not done, he ſent me word that the reaſon whye he went no ſooner was becauſe of the winde and tyde, and that he thought he was not able to doe much, vnderſtanding by a Dutch boye that ſwam away from the Enimy, that they had ſunke diuers shippes, that it was not poſſible to doe any thing, which afterwards he diſcouered to be true, and if they had not ben blocked, I think it is a queſtion amongſt Seamen, whether they could haue been aſſaulted, for that the place was ſo ſtraight thar no more then two of our shippes could come in breſt to them, and was the reaſon that the late Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> who tooke <hi>Cadiz,</hi> could ſend no ships there to doe the Enemy harme, but what they did them ſelues.</p>
            <p>This being deliuered to me in the Company of the Colonells, made vs all much greeued. Where vpon it was thought fitte he should retire with the ſquadron, hauing reſolued to imbarque our Landmen, and to ſtay no longer in regard the time was now comme, that the plate fleete was expected. So order was giuen that euery Regiment should imbarque accordingly, as they did
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:8057:11"/>
quarter, and that the fartheſt Regiment should make their retreate, fighting and retiring. But (I know not how it happened) ſome of the troopes were ingaged farther then they had order or reaſon, yet at length they came off without any great loſſe.</p>
            <p>I ſent alſo Maiſter <hi>Ielf</hi> the Maiſter <hi>Gunner</hi> of the feeld to <hi>Sir Thomas Loue,</hi> that ſome men might be ſent to the fort to diſmount the ordinance, and the 6 peeces were putt a board the Conuertiue of his Maieſtie, I ſent to him likewiſe for all the boates to reshippe our men.</p>
            <p>After I had ſeen all the troopes imbarqued, I found ſome horſes left behind, I made the horſeboates shippe them that night, though it were late, and gaue order that the fort should be kept all night till we were ready, and likewiſe commaunded the boates should be brought to receiue all the Landmen, that had the watch in the fort that night.</p>
            <p>Fryday the 28 about 2 in the afternoone all the fleet fell downe from the fort, and came to anckor without the Diamond, a little belowe <hi>Cadiz</hi>: One of the Dutch men of warre being defectiue was burnt, the Enemie ſent a shippe full of wildfiere and combuſtible matters but we preuented it, tooke the shippe, and ſunke it. There came 3 of the fleet vnto vs here, whoe were left behind in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland and had not ben with vs before.</p>
            <p>After this, we tooke 2 things into our conſideration, eſpecially one, not to omitt the meeting with the plate fleete, if it were poſſible for vs to be ſo happy. The other was to haue landed at Saint Mary Port, if the wind should not ſerue the fleet to goe out of the Bay of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz,</hi> becauſe we would looſe no time but doe ſomewhat. But (as ill luck was) the wind came good euen as we were in counſell, and before we could fully conclude,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8057:12"/>
allthough all was reſolued to ſtand for the plate fleete. And if we had not taken the winde at that inſtant, it might haue ben, we had not come out in a long time, &amp; being imbayed &amp; in a great deale of danger, if a ſtorme had taken vs, we had ben likely to haue ben driuen vpon a liegh shoare.</p>
            <p>The reſolution in the Bay of <hi>Cadiz</hi> aboard the Anne Royall the 29 of Octob. was. That the whole fleete shall preſently ſett ſayle, and plye to the ſouthward Cape, and ſtand off to the weſtward 60 leagues from the land where I purpoſe to ſpend as much time as may be to looke for the Spanish fleet, that comes from the Weſt-Indies, and to keepe your ſelues as neare as you can, in the latitudes of 37 and 37½ and in the latitude of 36 and 26½, farther to the ſouthward I intend not to goe.</p>
            <p>What other inſtructions shalbe thought fitting you shall receiue as occaſion preſents, in the meane time charging all commaunders to obſerue this directions, &amp; to keepe company with me, and the fleet, and to looke out and ſeize vpon the ſubiects, and goods of the King of Spaine, or other Enemy.</p>
            <p>This afternoone a generall Counſell was called, for the reſoluing to ſend ſome the moſt defectiue shippes, with the horſe ships, and the prizes, with ſome land ſickmen, whereof there was great ſtore.</p>
            <p>Sonday the 30. we ſett ſaile againe though with a contrary wind, this day we had 4 shippes in chace but could not fetch them vp.</p>
            <p>Monday the laſt, the wind came weſterly, yet could we not come forth of the Bay.</p>
            <p>A generall Counſell was called touching the diuers complaints of the defects of ships as the Rainbowe, the golden Cock, and others, wherefore it was reſolued, that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:8057:12"/>
we should plye towards the Iſles of Bayon, to take in fresh water, and repaire our defects as well as we could. This day Tueſday the firſt of Nouember &amp; Wedneſday the 2 the wind was at north weſt faire wether.</p>
            <p>Thurſday the 3 the wind was at north eaſt and by eaſt, in the night we had a calme which continued all Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, &amp; by a Generall conſent (though wee were in great want of water nor hauing much beer, which was our onely defect) to ſtay till the 20 of November. But it pleaſed God ſo to lay his heauy hand vpon vs, that it made vs all aſtonished, for I could here of nothing, but that euery day there fell downe ſo many, and ſo ſodenly, that they had not men enough to handle their ſailes, and it is alwayes to be accounted 6 weekes to be allowed to any ship that is homewards bound.</p>
            <p>This day in the morning we diſcouered 3 ſayle of shippes to windward the Dreadnaught, being next vnto them, and being calme our barge was mand, and ſent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, whoe comming neere one of the shippes had ſpent her maſts, and was towed by the others vntill the barge came vp, then the other 2 ships forſooke her, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing pillaged, and cutt holes in her, but immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our men came a board she ſuncke, being laden with Suger and Tobacco, and the lyke, being therefore ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to comme from <hi>Braſiele,</hi> and the other 2 Turkish me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of warr, that had formerly taken her, our barge came back to the Dreadnaught &amp; ſtayed there all night, and in the morning came vp to vs.</p>
            <p>Nothwithſtanding I had ſundry times before ſtrictly commaunded the Captains and Maiſters to ſtay better by the fleet, which they obſerued not, I did againe charge them once more to obſerue their directions, that were preſcribed them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:8057:13"/>Againe diuers complaints were made of the wants, &amp; defects of the ships, and increaſe of ſickneſſe.</p>
            <p>Saterday the 5. the wind continued at north &amp; north north eaſt faire weather.</p>
            <p>Sonday the 6 we tooke a Turkishman of warre of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geere, whoe had taken 2 prizes one from <hi>Braziele</hi> Ioa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with Suger, with a Iury maſt the other a Scotchman one Iohn Iſack dwelling at Douer, whoe was fraugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with wood and Iron from <hi>Biskey</hi> for Saint <hi>Lucas</hi> by the King of Spaines ſubiects, and had an extraordinary fraught promiſed for his voyage, which showes the great want, that the King hath of Timber or shipping to carry it. The Turke had not offred him any violence, but onely made prize of his goods, and promiſed the Maiſter his fraught at Argeere; ſo I diſcharged him againe, taking out ſome English Renegadoes that were willing to leaue him.</p>
            <p>The night following, the Turke went away from vs with the Braziele prize, the Scotchma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtayed with vs ſtill.</p>
            <p>Monday the 7 we diſcouered 9 or 10 ſaile of shippes to the leward, we bore vp, and found them to be of our own fleet, whoe had careleſly loſt Company, which as now ſo diuers times before had occaſioned vs to chaſe our own men, whereby our courſe was much hindred.</p>
            <p>Tueſday the 8 a generall Counſell was held, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it was ordred, that 6 of the Coleships should preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goe for England, with 3 of the Dutch prizes, &amp; the horſe-shippes, whereof Captain <hi>Pokinhorne</hi> being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Admirall, had warrant, and inſtructions accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, but before their departure, the Rainebow being found very defective, and the Captain Sir <hi>Iohn Chidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi> being very ſicke, went home Admirall of theis shippes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:8057:13"/>One of the prizes called the Readhart whereof <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe Bullock</hi> tooke charge, was wanting this 2 dayes, and went for England without any order from me like an vnworthy perſon.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe one of the hoye-shippes caled the Trewe Loue was not ſeen in the fleet ſince we came forth.</p>
            <p>This day and wedneſday the 9 we being in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 37, laye theiſe 2 daies at hull.</p>
            <p>Thurſday the 10 Sir <hi>Michel Geere</hi> whoe had ben wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting 5 dayes came to vs whoe went willfully from vs, without leaue, and when his maiſter tould him of it, he beate him with a Cudgell, which is againſt all diſcipline, and reaſon, his Maiſter hauing had better commaund before, then euer he had.</p>
            <p>This day I gaue the Captains their inſtructions, if we mett with the Weſt-India fleet, how to diſpoſe and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them ſelues.</p>
            <p>This day I ſent aboard the Dreadnaught for 10 tuns of beere that were putt into her for the vſe of the Anne Royall, but the company aboard mutined, and would not deliuer it, neither would the Captain and Maiſter acknowledge who were the Mutineeres, ſo that we wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Iorny 50 tuns of beere which were carried for vs, which made vs liue many dayes vpon beueradge.</p>
            <p>Fryday the 11 of November I called a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, where it was ordred, that the Saint <hi>George</hi> of the Kings, who had 150 ſick men in her, for the ſafety of his Maieſties shippe, and of thoſe that were yet well, that euery shippe should ſpare them 2 men and take 2 ſick men in their ſteed, which they did.</p>
            <p>This day the shippes that were to goe for England were diſmiſſed, and ſett ſaile a little before night.</p>
            <p>A Soldier that belonged to the Antony, of Captain

               <hi>Blague</hi> was duckt at the main yarde arme of the Anne Royall for being mutinous againſt the Seamen.</p>
            <p>Saterday the 12 and Sonday the 13 faire wether, the wind north eaſt.</p>
            <p>Monday the 14 I called a Counſell occaſioned by the ſeuerall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints made of many ships, eſpecially the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiue of his Maieſties co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded by Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> hauing but 20 ſound men to handle their ſailes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was ordred that the Reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should ſend 6 me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboard her, &amp; one of the worſt Catches (being by ſuruey found vnable to continue the voyage, &amp; valewed at 55 pound) was ſunck &amp; the men put into the Conuertiue.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe there were 6 men taken out of other ships &amp; put aboard the Talbott. Captain <hi>Burden</hi> which ship was in great want of men, and generally all the shippes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the like defects.</p>
            <p>Tueſday the 15 and Wedneſday the 16 the wind nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly, &amp; much wind. Thurſday the 17 the wind north weſt faire wether. We gaue chaſe to ſome shippes that were farre a head of vs, whome we found to be my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and ſome of his ſquadron whome we had not ſeen in many dayes before. Nothwithſtanding the often &amp; great complaints before generally throughout, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the reſt came Sir <hi>Sam: Argall</hi> from my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> to lett me knowe in what bad eſtate his shippe was hauing but 15 in a watch to handle their ſailes, deſiring me that I would call a Counſell, for that he imagined other ships were in as bad eſtate as he, what we reſolued he would agree vnto. Where vpon a Counſell was called, at which Counſell I forbore to make knowen the defects of the An Royall, that were as much as any ship in the fleet, &amp; made me the rather beleeue the Generall complaints, as you shall vnderſtand when I ſpeake of my comming into Ireland, &amp; I deſired to know how euery ones caſe ſtoode,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8057:14"/>
&amp; whether it were not poſſible for vs to haue gone for the Iſles of Bayon. Then Sir <hi>Samuell Argall,</hi> &amp; the reſt of the beſt Seame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that were preſent (by whome we were to be guided) gaue their opinion, that if we went for the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of Bayo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this miſerable eſtate we were now in, we might as well perish there as at Sea, by reaſon we should find no relief there for our ſick men, nor should we gett on shore there for water in any ſtormy wether; and that wind which would carry vs for Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, would not ſerue to comme out of the Iſlands of Bayon, &amp; that if the wind should shorten going for England, we might at the worſt retorne for Bayon, &amp; that all men of experience did cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly affirme, that the Plate fleet, did neuer comme after Novemb. The Counſell of warre vpon this neceſſity of ſicknes, want of men &amp; ſundry co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints of want of beere &amp; water &amp; many leakes diſcouered, reſolued vpon the 17 of Nouember, to bend the courſe directly homeward, &amp; putt into Faimouth, Plymouth or Porthmouth, which could be firſt and moſt conveniently obtained, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution if we had not taken, we had enda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gered the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the whole fleet. Fryday the 18. Saterday the 19. Sonday the 20. and Monday the 21 many violent guſts of wind, and raine. Tueſday the 22 in regard of the contrary wind, and fearing a neceſſity, we came to a shorter allowance a board the Anne Royall.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday the 23. Thurſday the 24. Fryday the 25. and Saterday the 26 continuall vehement guſts of wind &amp; raine, and Saterday night the wether began to be more moderate. Euer ſince our firſt ſetting forward for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, the fleet hath ben ſcattred more and more, ſo that this day we had but 4 ships in Company with vs, which diſorder would haue ben aduantageous for the Enemy if they had ſett vpon vs.</p>
            <p>Sonday the 27 in the afternoone it began to blowe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8057:15"/>
hard, and about 2 of the clocke in the afternoone, our foreyard broake in fower peeces and our foreſaile rent.</p>
            <p>Monday the 28 we tooke downe our maine miſane maſt and fitted it for a foreyard.</p>
            <p>Tueſday the 29 our ſpritſaile rent, we were forced to take it downe, this day we had onely 2 shippes &amp; one Catch in our company.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday the 30 the winde weſt-ſouth-weſt faire wether.</p>
            <p>Thurſday the firſt of December and Fryday the 2 the winde being contrary we lay at leigh and fished our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt which we feared the breaking off.</p>
            <p>Saterday the 3 the wind Northerly, fowle wether.</p>
            <p>Sonday the 4 the wind ſouthweſt towards night more weſterly, the Sea ran exceeding high.</p>
            <p>Monday the 5 the wind weſterly, little wind.</p>
            <p>Tueſday the 6 the wind at eaſt, at night more ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly this night wee ſounded and had 80 fathome wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday the 7 Thurſday the 8 and Fryday the 9 the wind eaſterly about 4 of the clocke in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone vve diſcouered Silly vvhich did beare ſouth eaſt, then vve ſtood about to the ſouthward.</p>
            <p>Saterday the 19 the vvind continued at eaſt: The Maiſter and the Company vvere very earneſt to goe for Ireland, by reaſon the shippe vvas very leaky, the men vveake, and vve being to the leevvard of Silly, and the vvind ſtill contrary, and violent, and if we should haue ben driuen to the vveſtvvard of Ireland, vve might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the loſſe of the shippe, and our ſelues.</p>
            <p>Vpon this neceſſity I condiſcended there vnto, for that vve could not haue endured 4 dayes, ſuch vvas her leake, and about 10 of the clocke before noone vvee bore vp.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:8057:15"/>The 11 being Sonday, the vvinde at eaſt at 9 in the morning we diſcouered land at the going into Corke, ſo vve ſtood to the vveſtvvard, and at 3 in the afternoone came to an anckor at <hi>Kinſall,</hi> where vve found his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties shippes the <hi>Antelop,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Phenix</hi> whoe aſſiſted vs with their boates to bring vs into the harbour. And this my ill fortune turned to good fortune both for the releef of his Maieſties shippes, and the troopes and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I had but ſmall ſtore of mony (not hauing with me at the firſt but 2000 pounds w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was to victuall the shippes, and to releeue all neceſſities) which if I had not had, we had ben all in a miſerable caſe, yet I made shift to relieue the Soldiers, and the Officers (ſaue only a shippe of Captain <hi>Butlers,</hi> who fell vpon the North-coaſt of Ireland) without bringing the King into debt, vntill my Lord Preſident <hi>Villers</hi> of Munſter by order from your Lordships receiued them into his charge, where we receaued newes that Captain <hi>Burleyes</hi> shippe was foundred in the Sea, but moſt of the Officers were ſaued, as they were here I came, comming for the Coaſts of Ireland.</p>
            <p>Here I came with 160 ſick men in my shippe 130 caſt ouer board, with a leake of aboue 6 foote water in the hould, and her leake was not in one place alone, but in many, for when she was in harbour she was not ſo leaky, but when she was at Sea, she tooke in 3 foote of water in 24 howers, she was ſo ould and ſo decayed a shippe.</p>
            <p>Monday the 12 the ſick men were carried a shoare for their recouery and billetted.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday the 14 hauing landed our ſick men, we carined our shippe, ſtopped her leakes, and mended her as well as time and place would permitt, we tooke in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8057:16"/>
ballaſt, wood, water, beer, and other prouiſions, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our shippe for the firſt faire wind to be ready to ſett ſaile.</p>
            <p>On Sonday the 18 about 3 in the afternoone his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties shippe rhe Conſtant Reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, came into this Harbour, hauing ſpent both their fore-maſt, and main-maſt, and conſtrayned to cutt away their broken maſts, yards, ſailes and ropes, to preuent farther danger.</p>
            <p>The Reformation being ſo defectiue, that she could not goe home till she were furnished with maſts, and other neceſſaries, from England, for the eaſe of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties charge we tooke out her men, and putt them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Aune Royall, leauing her onely 120 men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many were ſuch ſick men, as of our shippe muſt otherwiſe be left behind, not able to doe ſeruice, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualled her out of the other ships for 4 moneths from the firſt of Ianuary.</p>
            <p>The Globe of <hi>London,</hi> whereof Captain <hi>Stokes</hi> was Commaunder, being at an ancker in the harbour at Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temore, was by extremity of fowle wether driuen a shore, and caſt away. I directed a commiſſion to Sir <hi>William Hull,</hi> and others for the ſafe cuſtody, of what could be ſaued in the behalf of the King, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priators.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Iohn Chidly</hi> being with his Maieſties shippe at Crooke-hauen, (who departed the 8 of November from vs, and was driuen into Ireland) there came in a ſmall barque laden with Iron from Bilbowe, wherein alſo were 4 Ieſuites, he made ſtay of the barque and preeſts, and by my order brought them into England.</p>
            <p>The 19 of Ianuary there came into Kinſall a shippe from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> loaden with ſalt 3 cheaſts of Suger, &amp; ſome Tobacco, and ſuſpecting them to be Dunkerkes goods,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8057:16"/>
brought them for England.</p>
            <p>The Dutch men aboard this ship whoe came from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and had ſerued the Spaniard, did certainly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, that they ſawe diuers letters from <hi>Cadiz,</hi> that the fleete came in 4 daies after our comming out of <hi>Cadiz</hi> Bay, and that there were 100 Caruells ſent to haue ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped them, but that none of them could meete with the Plate fleet, for they came by the coaſt of <hi>Barbary.</hi> So that if any of 3 accidents had happined that followe, we had ben Maiſters of the Spanish fleet. The firſt is if the Counſell had condiſcended to me to haue kept <hi>Puntall</hi> for 14 dayes; the ſecond if the wind had not changed, as it did. The laſt, if the Plate-fleete had kept the courſe they euer haue done theis 40 yeares, for they had no manner of newes of vs, and had then comme amongſt vs, and if we had ſtayed in the Bay, they had donne the like, but man propoſeth and God determines.</p>
            <p>The ſame men affirme that in Iuly laſt, there were not 4 barrells of powder in all <hi>Lisbon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I remained in Kingſall on ship-board (ſaue onely that it pleaſed my Lord Preſident of Munſter, and the Earle of Corke to doe me the honour to fetch me to Pohall, where I remained the holly-daies whileſt my shippe was making ready) till the 28 of Ianuary winde bound.</p>
            <p>Saterday the 28 I ſett ſaile about 12 of the clocke from Kinſall, there come out with vs ſix more of our fleete, the prize called the <hi>Greyhound,</hi> and the shippe from <hi>Lisbon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sonday the 29 about 3 of the clocke in the morning being a great ſtorme, and the wind contrary at ſouth ſouth eaſt we bore vp againe for Ireland, the wether was
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8057:17"/>
ſo foggy and darke, that we durſt not come neere the shore, but ſtood to the weſtward.</p>
            <p>Monday the 30 about in the morning, the wether clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vp we ſtood in for the shore, but about 10 in the fore noone it was raine and foggy wether, ſo we could not marke the land vntill we were to the Leeward of Crooke-hauen, which we could not recouer, but about 3 in the afternoone we came into Beere-hauen, with foule wether, and much winde, all the shippes loſt vs, but the next day (onely the 2 prizes) came in.</p>
            <p>I putt to Sea three times againſt all Seamens opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that deſired to ſee a wind ſettled before we should goe out. But my deſire was ſuch not to looſe any time, that I did not harken to any.</p>
            <p>From the 3 of February till the 19 we lay in Beere-hauen, hauing the wind ſtill contrary, and ſtormy we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The 19 of February, the winde being at north faire wether we weyed anckor, and ſett ſaile about noone, but ſo ſoone as we came out of the harbour, we found the wind north eaſt, and the night following was very much wind, raine, haile, ſnowe, and the wind va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable.</p>
            <p>Monday the 20 about 1 in the morning we ſtood in againe for the shoare, and about two in the afternoone came to an anckor at Crooke-hauen, with the wind at eaſt, where we found the Rainbowe of the Kings, the Dragon, and the Prudence.</p>
            <p>Finding the shippe very leaky, we mended her here the ſecond time, the harbour being fitter then any other, for the carining her.</p>
            <p>Here I ſtaid till the 24 of February and then putt to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8057:17"/>
Sea againe, intending to haue come for Porthmouth, but when we came vpon the Coaſt there aroſe a great ſtorme, and the vvether grewe very darke and foggy, that we could not marke the Iſle of Weight, ſo we ſtood for the downs, where we arriued the laſt of February, and after our long ſtay came in 5 dayes 500 miles.</p>
