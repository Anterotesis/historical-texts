            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>May it pleaſe your Honours,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WEE who have (for theſe two yeares, paſt) been by your honours conducted through many dangers, and by providence have been hitherto protected, who have often ſeen the devouring ſword of a raging enemy drawn forth againſt us, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning deſtruction to us, and now ſee them vanquiſht, and our ſelves ſeemingly ſetled in peace and ſafety, are yet ſenſible of a more dangerous ſtorme hanging over our heads, then ever the malice of our open enemies could have contrived or their fury c<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uſed to fall upon us, which unleſſe diverted, ſtrikes not only at our liberty, but alſo at our lives. To whom (next to our M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ker) ſhall we fly for ſhelter but to your honours, our Patrons, and Protectors, from what ſecondary meanes ſhall we expect our deliverance, but from that hand that hath ſo often been ingaged with us? And from that heart that hath as often been ſo tender over us; and carefull for our ſecurities.</p>
            <p>Can we ſuffer and you not ſympathiſe? Can we be proclaimed Rebels and your Honours remain ſecure? Ah, dear Sirs! Let your wonted care for us be further demonſtrated, ceaſe not to ſpeak for us, who together with your ſelevs, and in obedience to your commands, have adventured all that is deare to us, for the Kingdomes ſafety.</p>
            <p>Hath any thing been deſired by us that hath not been promiſed us, or then wee have juſt cauſe to expect, if there hath, then let it and the authors thereof periſh? But can the Parliament upon miſ-information paſſe us for enemies, and wee not therein perceive the deſignes of our Enemies? Can wee be ſatisfied with a complement, when our fellow Soldiers ſuffer at every Aſſize, for acts meerly relating to the Warre? Is it not our lives wee ſeek for? Where ſhall wee be ſecured, when the meer envy of a malicious perſon is ſufficient to deſtroy us? Were our Enemies in the field with their ſwords in their hands, wee ſhould expect no more then a bare command, and a divine protection in our ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voures to free our ſelves but it is another; and a farre worſe Enemy that wee have to deal with, who like Foxes lurke in their Dens; and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be dealt with, though, diſcovered, being protected by thoſe who are intruſted with the Government of the Kingdome; it is the griefe of our hearts, that wee cannot deſire our own ſecurity, without the hazard of your Honours, if but in ſpeaking in our behalfe: When ſhall we ſee Juſtice diſpenced without partiality, or when ſhall the weal publike be ſingly ſought after &amp; endevoured; can this Iriſh expedition be any thing elſe, but a deſign to ruine &amp; break this Army in peeces, certainly reaſon tels us it can be nothing elſe; otherwiſe, why are not thoſe who have bin made inſtruments in our Countries deliverance, again be thought worthy to be employed? Or why are ſuch (who for their miſcariages have been caſt out of the Army) thought fit to be intruſted, and thoſe members of the Army encouraged and preferr'd to that ſervice, when they are for the moſt part ſuch, as (had they conſidered their juſt demerrits) might rather have expected an ejection then imployment: Wee are ſenſible, yea, far more ſenſible of the bleeding condition of <hi>Ireland,</hi> (crying aloud for a Brotherly aſſiſtance) then thoſe forward undertakers in this preſent deſigne manifeſt themſelves to be, and ſhall willingly contribute the utmoſt of our abilities towards their reliefe, when wee ſhall ſee this to be the only thing ſought after, and indevoured; but wee are confident, that your Honours cannot but perceive, that this plot is but a meer cloake, for ſome who have lately taſted of Soveraignity, and being lifted beyond the ordinary ſpheare of Servants, ſeek to become <hi>Maſters,</hi> and degenerate into Tyrants: We are earneſt therefore with your Honours, to uſe your utmoſt endevours, that before any other or further propoſitions be ſent to us, our expectations may be ſatisfied, which if they are not, wee conceive our ſelves, and our friends, as bad as deſtroyed, being expoſed to the mercileſſe cruelties of our malicious enemies, and ſhall your Honour, or any other faithfull Servant to the State, be appointed for the Service of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and accept of that imployment, we muſt of neceſſity (contrary to our deſires) ſhew our ſelves averſe to that ſervice, untill our juſt deſires be granted, the juſt Rights and liberties of the Subjects of England, vindicated and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; (and then) as God and our owne conſciences beare us witneſſe, ſhall we teſtifie to the Kingdom the integrity of our hearts to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and our forward actions ſhall demonſtrate the ſincerity of our expreſſions in reference to that imployment, once more we are earneſt with your honours for your aſſiſtance, without it we are like to be wholly ruind, and having obtaind it, may be inabled, as in duty we are bound to expreſſe our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Theſe three Gentlemen Soldiers whoſe names are hereto ſubſcribed, delivered the Letter in be halfe of the whole, <hi>Edward Sexby. Will. Allen. Thomas Sheppherd.</hi>
