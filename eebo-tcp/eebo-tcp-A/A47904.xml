            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Author of <hi>Franck Smith</hi>'s Paper, Entituled [<hi>Votes of the Honourable the Commons of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>Assembled in the late Parliament at</hi> West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster, <hi>in favour of Protestant Dissenters</hi>] is very little seen (I perceive) in the History of <hi>the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of</hi> Westminster, and the said <hi>Protestant Dissenters:</hi> He would never have stopt at a <hi>Broad-side</hi> else; and almost the <hi>one half</hi> of that too, spent in <hi>Remarque</hi> and <hi>Descant</hi> on the <hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now with Honour to the <hi>Commons</hi> of 1680. and 1681. and with all Due Respect to whatever they <hi>did</hi>; and to whatever they <hi>would</hi> have done; I shall take the freedom to inform the People, that the <hi>Commons</hi> of 1640. and 1641. did a great deal more for the <hi>Protestant Dissenters</hi> than ever <hi>these other Gentlemen,</hi> either <hi>did,</hi> or <hi>intended</hi> to do. You'l say perhaps, That the <hi>Protestant Dissenters</hi> of the <hi>Forty-One-Edition</hi> did what they did, for <hi>themselves,</hi> and only out of a kindness to the Children of their own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. As to That Point, let the matter e'en go as the Courteous Reader pleases. We are not here upon the HOW'S and the WHY'S; but in one word, upon the FACT; and you shall have it as plain, as the best Authorities of those Times can tell the Story: That is to say, <hi>Husbands his Two Volumes of Collections,</hi> and <hi>Scobel's Acts and Ordinances</hi>: unto which I shall refer ye, and you shall there see the Blessed Fruits of an <hi>Union of Dissenters,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:64328:3"/>
and a <hi>Thorough-Reformation: Monarchy</hi> Reduc'd within the Bounds of <hi>Law:</hi> The <hi>King</hi> made a <hi>Glorious Prince</hi> in his <hi>Person</hi>; and his <hi>Dignity</hi> provided for; His <hi>People</hi> setled in <hi>Peace,</hi> and his <hi>Royal Revenue</hi> in <hi>Plenty.</hi> You shall there understand the meaning of <hi>Moderating</hi> the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant Power</hi> of the <hi>Bishops:</hi> Clearing the Service of God, of <hi>Anti-Christian Ceremonies,</hi> and <hi>Human Inventions,</hi> and setting up that which they call a <hi>Painful, Conscientious,</hi> and <hi>Gospel-Ministry</hi> in the Land. You shall there learn what it is for the <hi>Subjects</hi> to be <hi>Secur'd</hi> in their <hi>Lives, Liberties, Consciences</hi> and <hi>Estates</hi>; For you'l find, in the <hi>Holy Idiome,</hi> That when a man is <hi>Imprison'd, Transplanted,</hi> put to <hi>Death, Sequester'd, Plunder'd</hi>; His <hi>Person, Life,</hi> and <hi>Estate,</hi> is said (for so much) to be <hi>Secur'd.</hi> And so is his <hi>Conscience,</hi> when he comes to be put a <hi>Ship-Board,</hi> or <hi>Immur'd</hi> betwixt Four Walls, for not taking the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> You will see there, what is Intended by <hi>Securing</hi> the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> and his <hi>Revenue, Church-Lands, Delinquents Estates,</hi> &amp;c. And according to the <hi>Dissenters Lexicon,</hi> The True Sense of EASING the People. Were they not <hi>Eased</hi> of their <hi>Liberties,</hi> their <hi>Fortunes,</hi> their <hi>Lives,</hi> their <hi>Governours,</hi> and their <hi>Teachers?</hi> What a Blessing it was to have a Wanton, and a Plethorique Nation, <hi>Eas'd</hi> of a matter of <hi>Sixty Millions of Money</hi> besides <hi>By-Blows</hi>? And in short, What can be a Greater <hi>Ease</hi> to any man, than to have nothing left him either to <hi>Lose,</hi> or to <hi>Care for</hi>? And then to have a <hi>Blessed Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Divines</hi> at last for his <hi>Confessors</hi> to <hi>Absolve</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him, for the Contempt of God and his Commandments? And who but the <hi>Protestant-Dissenters</hi> still; for the <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Executors,</hi> upon this wonderful Revolution to all <hi>Changes of Government. [It is far</hi> from our Purpose or Desire <hi>say the Remonstrators, (Exact Collections, Pag.</hi> 19.) to let loose the Golden Reins of Discipline and Government in the Church, <hi>&amp;c.

Col. Pag. 1.] What might be the Drift of such a Rabble of Calumnyes, Crouded up into that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance? <hi>The Government wanted mending</hi> (it seems) and if his Majesty would but have minded his own Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Business, and left them to manage Matters of State, [<hi>We doubt not</hi> (say they) <hi>but God will Crown this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with such Success, as shall be the beginning and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of more Honour and Happiness to His Majesty than ever yet was enjoyed by any of his Royal Predecessors,</hi> Ex. Col. Pag. 21.] I shall not need to tell ye the kindness these People had for Protestant Dissenters; when only <hi>Papists,</hi> and the <hi>Canonical Sons of the Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> (under the Notion of <hi>Church-Papists</hi>) were <hi>excepted</hi> from Time to Time out of all their <hi>Dispensations:</hi> And not only the <hi>Episcopal Clergy,</hi> but the <hi>Service-Book</hi> it self; and all the <hi>Friends,</hi> both of the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> cast out of all Terms of Christian Accommodation. The <hi>Pretext</hi> was <hi>Popery</hi> too: But so soon as ever they had gotten the Prey in the Foot, they presently laid down their <hi>Religion,</hi> and took up the <hi>Booty</hi>; and their Osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Loyalty</hi> concluded in the <hi>Subversion</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the Crime by Acquitting themselves of an <hi>Actual</hi> hand in the <hi>Horrid Regicide,</hi> or in giving <hi>Advice</hi> upon that single Point: The <hi>Majesty</hi> of the King was Murder'd in that very <hi>Remonstrance</hi>; and the Doctrine and Design of it laid open the Way in a Direct Line from the <hi>Pen</hi> to the <hi>Scaffold</hi>

            <p>But they themselves, in the Third of their own Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are the Best Expositors of their Thoughts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs; so that without any further Comment, I shall only Recommend ye to the Tract of their Proceedings, as it stands upon Record in their own Writings: Wherein I have been so far from forcing any thing beyond the Clear Import and meaning of it, That I have been Partial rather on the other hand, in Representing it less than I have found it.

               <hi>Querela Cantabrigiensis</hi> will tell ye what Havock they made in the University of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where they ejected near Two Hundred, besides Nine Masters, and Three more dead.

            <p>Neither did <hi>Oxford,</hi> when it came to their turn to suffer, scape any better than <hi>Cambridge</hi> had done before. For no sooner had his Majesties Defeat ended the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in the Field, but a new War was raised in the House of Commons, about dividing the Spoyl; in which Contest the Independent Faction out-witting the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian, there was no Triumph left for the Presbyterian but to insult upon them they call'd the <hi>Common Enemy</hi>; and being hopeless of any other Empire, contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves now to sit down with the Honour of being Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners, of destroying and doing mischief. To this End when the Independents found it their Interest to gain upon the Nation by pretences to Moderation and <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> the other Party pursued the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Principle</hi> of <hi>Root and Branch,</hi> as vigorously as ever: And accordingly, the Presbyterian Divines, by Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

and unwearied Solicitations at the House of Commons door, and in the Pulpit press'd hard, and at last procur'd an <hi>Ordinance</hi> for the <hi>Visitation</hi> of the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> (see Mr. <hi>Hen.

Any Five having full power to hear and determine in all Cases by the <hi>Ordinance,</hi> which bore Date <hi>May</hi> 1. 1647. Accordingly, on the <hi>Fourth</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> they Summon the University to appear before them, between the Hours of Nine and Eleven, and that their Usurpation might have all necessary formalities, A Sermon was to precede, where Mr. <hi>Harris,</hi> (the man who was famous for <hi>Sanctifying the holding six Livings at a time and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring it no plurality</hi>) held forth so long, till the time prefixt was elapst, this being observed by the Vice-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, who Commanded all the <hi>University-Men</hi> then in Expectation of their doom in the <hi>Convocation-House,</hi> to depart home. The Visitors being in some disorder by this little disappointment, and the Contest between the two <hi>Juntas</hi> growing still higher, the <hi>University-Men</hi> so contriv'd delays, by putting in little stops with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee in <hi>London,</hi> that these Reformers were forced for a time to desist. But in <hi>October</hi> following, having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured an Order (dated the Eighth, 1647.) for sending the Vice-Chancellor, Dr. <hi>Fell,</hi> Prisoner to <hi>London,</hi> They began a closer Siege, and <hi>April</hi> 6. 1648. return'd in Earnest to revenge themselves not only of the Malignity but the Resistance of this place.</p>

            <p>After this they went on, but by lesser numbers, and upon several pretences, to make a <hi>Thorough Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; Ejecting some for refusing the <hi>Engagement,</hi> others for <hi>absence,</hi> and some few for <hi>Submitting too late.</hi> It may be Observ'd that of the <hi>University-Men</hi> who were <hi>Visitors</hi> all but two were obnoxious to the <hi>Old Establish'd Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity.

In <hi>Magdalens</hi> they share the Stock of <hi>Mony</hi> left from the

Founder Time, as Sacred. There and elsewhere they make havock of Woods, nay Sell the Timber of the very Colledge from off the Walls: (So they did at <hi>Christ-Church,</hi>) Rack the Tenants; insomuch that in <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> there, (in that short time they were Possess'd of it) <hi>Purchast more Lands, than all their Predecessors had done from the Time of the Foundation to their coming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to their Reformation of <hi>Manners,</hi> they made most <hi>Colleges Publick-Tipling-Houses</hi>: Strong Beer and Ale being Sold in the <hi>College-Butteries,</hi> and sent for into the Town as frequently as from <hi>Common Alehouses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Advance of Learning, was the laying aside all <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastick Exercises,</hi> and running after <hi>Extemporary Sermons,</hi> and then repeating them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> was the laying aside all the Devotions of the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>particular Founders:</hi> Nay of the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> insomuch That there were not left four Persons in the whole University, who durst re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it before their <hi>Sermon.</hi> The perfect abolition of the <hi>Communion</hi>; it being not so much as once administred during the whole time of their reign.

            <p>It is Remarkable that after the great Clamor against Vice in this University; No Man during the whole fury of this Visitation, was Ejected for any thing but his <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and for not daring to violate his Oaths of Allegiance to his <hi>Prince,</hi> his Oaths to the <hi>University,</hi> and to his <hi>Local Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes</hi>: nay every one of these Gentlemen which punisht this their consideration of their Duty, were likewise ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by the <hi>same Oaths.</hi>

               <p>YOU have here a Naked and Historical Deduction of a Sublimated Reformation, under the Reign of our <hi>late Protestant Dissenters</hi> of <hi>Execrable</hi> and <hi>Infamous Memory</hi>; and as <hi>Time</hi> is the Mother of <hi>Truth,</hi> so <hi>Past-Ages</hi> are the Best Glass of <hi>Those to come</hi>; for mutations in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments as well as in Natural Bodies, proceed by a Leading Connexion of <hi>Causes</hi> and <hi>Effects.</hi> Here's neither any Need, or Possibility of Rendring things worse than they were by <hi>Partiality</hi> and <hi>Descant</hi>; for as it is one of the Foulest Pieces of Story that ever yet came to light; and of the most Audacious Affronts to the Laws of God and Man, the Duties of Common Faith, Humanity, Order, and Religion, that ever yet perhaps was offer'd in the Face of the Sun: so I have in this Summary of those Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, very Honestly left the <hi>Actors themselves</hi> to be their own <hi>Historians</hi>; and without any Malevolent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, Exposed them to be Try'd and Judg'd by their own Records; And for the Truth of what is here set down, I remit my self to the Credit of their own <hi>Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.</hi> And so far have I been from Enflaming the Recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, either with the <hi>Number</hi> of <hi>Particulars,</hi> or the <hi>Weight</hi> of <hi>Aggravations,</hi> that I have left out several Notorious Instances of <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Wickedn<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

It is not yet that in the publishing of these Papers I would be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to pass a Complement upon the <hi>Party,</hi> in speaking <hi>Better</hi> of them than they <hi>Deserve,</hi> or <hi>Less-Ill</hi> rather, than they have done of <hi>Themselves:</hi> But I have consulted

               </p>
               <p>But What's the End of this Pamphlet then You'l say?

               </p>
               <p>Now Pray what were the <hi>Pretences</hi> of <hi>One and Forty? Fears of Popery, Absolute Power, Evil Councellors, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Ministers, Prelatical Rigour; Popish Ceremonies; Ecclesiastical Discipline,</hi> &amp;c. And are not These the very Complaints of this Day? And are not <hi>Franck Smith's Dissenting Protestants</hi> the very Picture of that <hi>Godly Party</hi>? These <hi>Grievances</hi> must be remov'd they Cry'd; and we say the same thing now too. But by what means? By a <hi>Parliament</hi>; and so say we too. Well, And the Late King Call'd several Parliaments, and by his Royal Prerogative Dissolv'd them too, when he saw Occasion: and so has his Gracious Majesty now in Being. But at length betwixt the <hi>Credulity</hi> of his own <hi>Goodness,</hi> and the <hi>Importunity</hi> of some of his <hi>Treacherous Subjects,</hi> he made one False step that Ruin'd him past Recovery: And that was the Passing of a Bill, for the <hi>Continuance</hi> of that <hi>Fatal Parliament, till it should be Dissolved by the Consent of both Houses.</hi> This King, God be Praised, hath held his hand as to that Point. But the thing nevertheless has been fairly offer'd at, in several <hi>Papers of News,</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulatory Libels</hi>; insisting upon it as the Right and Claim of the People; And all to be Back'd with an <hi>Association</hi> too after the Model of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> Now who were the <hi>Sticklers</hi> I pray for That Reformation? Were they not <hi>Brownists, Anabaptists, Separatists, Independents, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians, Presbyterians, Fifth-Monarchy-Men, Ranters</hi>? And in One Word, the whole Mass of Men, of the most <hi>Sanguinary,</hi> and <hi>Heretical Principles,</hi> gathered together

under the Cloak of People of <hi>Tender-Consciences,</hi> and the <hi>Godly Party.</hi> And have not we our <hi>Dissenters</hi> now to Match their <hi>Godly Party</hi>; and of as many sorts almost as there went <hi>Beasts</hi> into the <hi>Ark</hi>; and of as <hi>Inconciliable Aversions?</hi> These are the People, that make it their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness to find faults in the Government; and for want of matter of Fact to work upon, they Invent and Create it.

This was the very Method of the Scandal and Calumny too of the Late Times, that was cast upon every man that Crossed the Humour of the Faction. How many <hi>Rotten Lords, Popish Bishops, Straffordians, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants,</hi> and <hi>Jesuited Papists,</hi> were People called; for Acting according to their Consciences, and opposing the Torrent of that Hypocritical Sedition? And thus far, the <hi>Parallel</hi> runs <hi>True</hi>; a <hi>Yorkist,</hi> a <hi>Pensioner,</hi> a <hi>Sham-Plotter,</hi> a <hi>Masquerader,</hi> a <hi>Tory,</hi> or the like; But the Scene of things to <hi>Come</hi> is yet in the <hi>Dark</hi>; and we have no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way then from what's <hi>Past</hi> to take a Caution against the <hi>Future.</hi> And to that End it is, That I have now Committed these Sheets to the Publick. The <hi>Establish'd-Religion</hi> was to be <hi>Reform'd</hi>; and they ran it so far, till not only <hi>Christianity,</hi> but even the <hi>Moral Duties</hi> of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

The <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Subject</hi> was a Great Point with 'em too; and what was the <hi>End</hi> on't; but the subjecting of the <hi>Nobility, Gentry,</hi> and all the <hi>Honest</hi> and <hi>Industrious People</hi> of the Nation to a Rapacious <hi>Committee of Blasphemous Hereticks:</hi> a <hi>Major General,</hi> and a <hi>Red-Coat</hi>; and our <hi>Estates, Liberties,</hi> and <hi>Lives,</hi> laid at the Mercy of those Vermine to <hi>Seize, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quester, Imprison, Hang</hi> and <hi>Draw</hi> at pleasure?
