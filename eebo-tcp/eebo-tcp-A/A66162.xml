            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>IT is strange, that of all men Papists should calumniate Protestants
with Treason and Rebellions; were Modesty an Essential in the
Complexion of a Jesuite, surely they would forbear, or Charity
they so much talk of, and so little practise, to be found among
them. Are horrid Massacres, villanous Assassinations, or Poisonings,
the Effect of Charity? Or, Is Malice inveterate, Traducing or Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Fruit thereof? Yet nothing is more obvious in the whole
course of History than those diabolical Machinations and hellish Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies
of Priests and Jesuites, especially within this last hundred and
fifty years; and, generally speaking, Princes, and crowned Heads,
have been most the objects of their Fury; and lest the palliation of
Villany should pass on the weaker sort, and this Objection any way
obtain, That forsooth most of these Contrivances were against Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Princes, excommunicated by the Pope and Church, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
delivered over to Satan, and that the killing of them really
was no Murther, no more than of Wolves or Bears.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, That Princes of the same Communion, as <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the Third of <hi>France,</hi> could not escape their fatal Stab, who never
made profession of any other; and though <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth was first
a Protestant, and by them constrained to change, nay, and highly
indulging them in his latter years, and as <hi>Mathieus</hi> says in his Life, to
all appearance was devout, I mean in their way; yet from <hi>Ravilliac</hi>'s
Hand all this could not defend him. We need not long here fix, but
look on former times, where for five or six hundred years nothing
hath been more common, or more lamentable, than the story of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Princes, struck with the Lightening of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
others wholly ruined by the Vatican Thunder, the consequences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either their own Tragical Ends, or, at the most favourable,
strong and lasting Rebellions, which all conversant in History may
plainly see; and so dextrous were they in translating to the other
<pb facs="tcp:97409:3"/>
World, that in the very Host it self was Poison given to one of the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erman Emperours, so that Silence to none is a more necessary Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
especially in this Case, than to regular Monks and Friars, who
for several Ages have been the very Pest and Bane of Secular Princes,
acting not only their Villanies in the Time of the Holy War, but in
the time of their Antipopes also. But to return to our own Nation:
What Barbarities have they not committed? What Impieties have
they not been guilty of? What Cruelties have they left unattemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
and yet with a brazen Front daily bespatter Protestants, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them of what themselves were Authours of; imitating herein
the very Skum of Mankind; for none shall sooner call another Rogue
than he that really is one; In whose mouth is Whore and Bitch more
frequent, than hers that is a common Prostitute? And to proceed:
What Disorder did they not cause, to plague and pester <hi>Harry</hi> the
Eighth? What Commotions did they not raise all the Reign of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> besides the Attempts upon her Person? What Divisions
did they not nourish all the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and in his
death had no small share? How horridly desperate they were in
King <hi>James</hi>'s time, appears by their inhumane Powder-Treason;
how intriguing they were in his Cabinet Councils is but too sad a
Truth to relate; fomenting his humour in the Spanish Match, a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
inglorious to his Memory, leaving the <hi>Pallsgrave</hi> (though his Son
in Law) a Victim to the House of <hi>Austria;</hi> and after by the Match
with <hi>France,</hi> how did he embroil his Son! they managing under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
the Queen, and she by her powerfull Influence did the King;
so that all the mischievous Evils of <hi>Charles</hi> the First they, like a Mole,
wrought under ground, spotting his Life with that business of <hi>Rochell,</hi>
and the Attempt of the Isle of <hi>Rhee,</hi> from whence the Protestants ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
date the ruine of their Church in <hi>France,</hi> and by the rising of
the French Monarchs since that time has endangered the ruine of the
whole Protestant Interest all over <hi>Europe,</hi> as of late years has been
manifestly evident; and lastly they drew a Civil War upon him,
though the Effects proved fatal, as well to themselves as others,
(Priests generally being no reaching Politicians;) the consequence of
which all men here do know: But that which most surprizes is their
Villany in conclusion; for when his farther Life could yield them no
advantage, they then conspired his Death; and to that end was a
Correspondence kept with <hi>Ireton</hi> and some others, not doubting, he
being gone, to have the bringing up of the Children, the Queen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wholly theirs, and managed to their Devotion; and how fatal
this has been I need not farther speak; and if any are desirous of far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

I must needs say of very good natural parts, though in several things
but ill applied them; and his Conversation spoke him a Gentleman,
but withall of a violent and impetuous Temper to whatever he took,
and unfortunate in most things he projected. I am the longer on this
Character, because most of our whiffling Priests and noisie Jesuites
have raked for their Clamours against Protestants about the business
of Rebellion, for many years last past, out of the Dunghill of that
Book, written not long after the King's coming in; so that 'tis plain,
that by their legerdemain Tricks in the Parliament Army they made
them mutinous against their Lords and Masters; and in the time of
the Agitatour's being rampant, meeting, as they say, in <hi>Putney</hi>
Church, they were very brisk in Masquerade among them, several
Priests, some as Troupers, others private Soldiers then listed, and
though these Agitatours were first set up by <hi>Ireton,</hi> yet in process of
time they became so unruly, and so beyond measure insolent, that
they were by force necessitated to suppress them, and they were the
occasion of breaking up that separate Party of <hi>Cromwell</hi> and <hi>Ireton</hi> in
the name of the Army which they had entred into with the King, and
by reason of them the King was frighted from <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> making
his Escape to the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> which did not long precede his death.
Now after a lapse of some years his Son <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, with the
rest of the Royal Family, were restored, and let us take a short view
of their Transactions under him, where no sooner he was settled, but
there came in whole Shoals of Priests from several parts beyond Seas,
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> who for several years before had scarce any, and those
that were skulking and lying close, was in a little time almost over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocked;
and Father <hi>Walsh,</hi> who was a kind of a Trimmer among
them, and, to speak truth, an honester sort of a man than most of
them were, and willing to introduce the King's Authority as well as
that of the Popes, to that End went over with the Duke of <hi>Ormond;</hi>
and being countenanced by him, summoned an Assembly in <hi>Dublin</hi> to
be held, of the most principal of them, where what a stir he had,
and how strangely bigotted those Irish Understandings were to the
See of <hi>Rome,</hi> is by himself at large set forth in his loyal Formulary:
But one thing which himself notes is not unworthy the recital, The
General among them were so strongly possest with some strange Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strophe
that was to arrive (eminently no doubt) to their Advantage,
in the year approaching of Sixty six, that they generally expressed
<pb facs="tcp:97409:4"/>
themselves so averse from complying with the King in those matters,
a violent presumption that the firing of <hi>London</hi> had been for some
years in contriving; and the mention that is made of a Plot in the
<hi>April</hi> Gazette, —65. was put into the Heads (by some Rascally Priests)
of those poor little Rogues that were hangued, one of the main things
charged upon them being the Firing of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and
what influence their Councils had in that Prince's Reign, is obnoxious
to all considering Men, by the breaking the triple League by that
close Alliance between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> for the Extirpation of
Protestancy out of Heretical <hi>Holland,</hi> and no doubt, had it succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
out of <hi>England</hi> also, and the reason why it was not effected,
was the Parliament's and People's Aukwardness to the War; but
notwithstanding they were so not discouraged, but they resolved to go
on with their Designs still in <hi>England,</hi> keeping, by the means of <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
and Father <hi>le Chaise,</hi> a constant Correspondence with the Court
of <hi>France,</hi> and so strong was their Ascendent with <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
that he publishes a Declaration for Liberty of Conscience, by
which, as <hi>Coleman</hi> in his Letters says, he doubted not the bringing in
of their Religion; but this so allarmed the Parliament, that they
were strangely uneasie and restless with him, resolving to give him
no more Money untill he had recalled it, which at last with regret
he did. This strangely nettled our Roguish Catholicks, who by this
thought their Game cock sure; but being frustrated, used him in
their Discourses as if he had been a Cobler, as pitifull, irresolute,
nothing of Honour, his Word no ways to be relied on, and not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of a Crown; and from that day forward plotted his removal,
to make way, as they supposed, for a Man of Honour and Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and who would not be balked with any thing of a Parliament;
which at the last, as a great many suppose, they effectually did.
And now <hi>James</hi> the Second ascended the Throne, and how the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
by him was swayed, needs no long characterising; for Father
<hi>Petre,</hi> with his Ghostly Associates, managed most things under him,
who with that Priestly Violence so hurried on things, that on him at
last the Tower of <hi>Siloam</hi> fell, and so weak and ridiculous were their
Politicks, that they are not worth blurring Paper. Now to sum up all,
it is plain by what precedes, That she several Popes and Court of
<hi>Rome,</hi> in places where they power had, have been most Imperious
and domineering, and nothing so bloudy, base, or cruel, but by
their Priests has acted been, not in other Countries only, but in this
our Nation too, for since the twelfth year, or thereabouts, Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, Popery we may compare to an Imposthume bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:97409:4"/>
in the very Trunk of this Political Body, and broke in the year
forty two into a Civil War, discharging only part, not all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
matter; and since regathering head, and filling up, about four
years ago broke the second time, casting forth Filth and Corruption
in quantity abounding, the Stench thereof offending almost all Men
in the Nation, but I do not doubt but our State Physicians will use such
detersive or cleansing Medicines, as well as sanative, as shall not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
a Palliative but a real and thorough Cure, and that the Countrey
may be restored to its sound habit of Body. Now therefore as to the
ensuing Treatise, it was occasioned by that Hero of English Jesui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
Mr. <hi>Pulton,</hi> who being strangely nettled at those stinging Truths
contained in the Missionaries Arts, challenges the Authour to make
good his Assertion in page 76. <hi>viz.</hi> That the Romanists Treasons
owned by their Popes, and by their great Men approved of since the
Reformation, do far outnumber all the Plots and Insurrections that
the Papists, or Malice itself can lay to the charge of Protestants; all
which notwithstanding have been wholly condemned by the Body of
our famous Divines: To satisfie therefore this <hi>Savoy</hi> Champion, and
vindicate the Assertion aforesaid, the Authour of this Account with no
little pains has endeavoured to give entire satisfaction: But such
has the Misfortune been of Writers Protestant, that in dealing in
Controversies they have to doe with a sort of Men, that when they
have, yet will seemiugly take no Answer; and their last refuge is
generally Banter and Whiffle, if downright Railing will not doe the
feat. The Subject of this Treatise is most matter of Fact, and the
Citations, though from their own selves no way unfairly used; for if
otherwise they appear, let them openly be exposed, that all that are
impartial may see and judge, whether any thing of Passion, Envy,
or Malice, has Prepossed the Authour, I know 'tis natural for Men,
when they have a bad Cause to manage, to be froward and testy,
and where they are galled to kick and wince, and instead of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
closely to the purpose, to seek Evasions that may seem plausible,
at least to the less refined Understanding, which has been the great
Masterpiece of Romish Priests and Jesuites for many years together;
for by their little Witticisms and Jokes upon Names, they keep up
among their Party a kind of Reputation, not unlike <hi>Jack Pudding</hi>'s
on a Stage, they please (though at the same time delude) the foolish
and gazing People; and if it happens that one slip falls from a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Pen, or a Citation carelesly passed, that has not proved true,
what a Clutter have they not made about it, though the main of the
<pb facs="tcp:97409:5"/>
Subject still remains good. This, as a demonstration, plainly proves
the Weakness of their Cause; and had Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi> but candidly read
the History of the last Hundred Years, he must have acknowledged
that this his great Challenge was a vain and frivolous Motion, and
never needed to have given the Authour this Trouble; which being
done, it's hoped will be to his firm conviction, and not only his, but
any other who have been imposed on by false Notions. The truth is,
this Treatise has been written above this year, but such was the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of the Times, that they would not bear, much less permit its
then Publication; however its hoped 'tis not too late the World in
this point to satisfie, the only Scope, Design, and End of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>

                  <p>WE behold how the King is changed from a
Christian to an Heretick; and how he hath
robb'd Christ's Vicar of his Rights and Privileges,
by placing himself in his Holiness's Seat there, as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
over the Catholick Church within the Realm.
It was the late damn'd Assembly of Lords and Commons
furthered his Pride, otherwise he could not nor durst
not assume it to himself: We have thought of these
passages, and do agree, That there is no way to break
this Tyrant's Neck but one; Puff him up in
his Pride, and let our Friends say unto him, That
it is beneath so mighty a Monarch as he, to advise with
Parliaments, but to act all in Person; and that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooveth
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97409:7"/>
his Majesty to be chief Actor himself. If he
assumes this, it will take off great Blemishes from the
Nation, which the Church holds them guilty of, and
doe our Business: For then the People (it being contrary
to their Laws) will fall from him; also the Catholick
Party of his Council will be too strong for the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
and then the Common sort will be the abler to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
his Tyranny. This is to be contriv'd with the
Church's Members, and cautiously, because it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
that the Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> have hindred
the Church in most of the Kings Reigns, otherwise She
had held her Party better than She does now. You

following the steps of his thundering Name-sake,
when the Dyet of the <hi>Germans</hi> at <hi>Ausburgh</hi> made
an Edict for full Liberty of Conscience, whereby
the Protestants were maintain'd in the Possession of
their Church Revenues, fell into a furious rage;
publickly threatening the Emperour and King of the

that if he did not recall the Edict, he would
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97409:9"/>
proceed against them with as severe Censures as he
intended to use against the Protestants; telling all
the Ambassadors in his Court, That he was above
all Princes, that he expected not that they should
treat with him as with their Equal, that he could
alter and take away Kingdoms as he thought good:
And one day at Dinner, in the presence of many
Persons of the highest Quality, he affirmed, That
he would subject all Princes under his Foot. No
wonder then that the same Spirit of Opposition to
Princes actuate the Members of the Church, which
possess'd their Head in such a degree, that upon the

by which, under a shew of maintaining the King,
they took from him all his Authority, to confer it
upon the Head of their Conspiracy: Nay, the zeal
for this rebellious Association was so great, that
they subscribed it with their Bloud; and in order to
the prosecution of what they had there promised,
they sent <hi>Nicolas David,</hi> an Advocate of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Paris,</hi> to <hi>Rome;</hi> but he being slain by the
way on his return, Cardinal <hi>de Pellive</hi> afterwards
managed their business with the Pope.</p>
            <p>But among the Memoirs of that Advocate there
was found an Account of the Transaction between
the Pope and the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Transaction in the Appendix to the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the sincerity of the Prot. Relig.</note> wherein the Design
laid down is to pull down the House of <hi>Valois,</hi> then
reigning, from the Throne, and set up the Duke of
<hi>Guise:</hi> In this Transaction the Liberties of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican
Church are called a damnable Errour, nothing
else but the shift of the Waldenses, Lutheranes, and
Calvinists; and it is affirmed that <hi>France</hi> shall never
prosper as long as the Crown continues in that line.
The whole Platform of the Design is there laid down,
and the Pope is to advance that Duke to the Crown
of <hi>France,</hi> as the Successour of <hi>Charlemagne;</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
whereof the Duke is bound to cause the

Answer, That they were sent from the
Pope and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to whom his Holiness had
given <hi>Ireland;</hi> for that <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had justly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
her Title to the Kingdom by Heresie, that
they would keep what they had got, and get more
if they could: But in a small time after they were
glad to surrender upon Mercy, the Earl of <hi>Desmond</hi>
having been routed before, and <hi>Allen,</hi> the Priest,
who came with the Legate <hi>Sanders,</hi> slain. This
ill success put a stop to the Recruits the Pope was
preparing to send after them. <hi>Sanders</hi> dyed of
hunger in the Woods, and the Earl of <hi>Desmond</hi> was
slain two years after by a common Soldier.</p>
            <p>And to encourage these Rebels, and to excite to

the same year, renewed the Bull of <hi>Pius

Copies of it printed at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Bull it

            <p>But though he pronounced that terrible Sentence

                  <hi>Auth. Tyrrell</hi> in his Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, p. 29.</note> one who had been
a great stickler for the Romish Church,) he dealt
a great deal more subtilly, and more dangerously
than his Predecessour; for finding the danger the
Romanists were daily exposed to, by their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
the Destruction of the Queen, whom they
durst not obey, or cease to hurt, for fear of the
Curses denounced in the Bull; he qualified it in
such a manner, that the Jesuite <hi>Hart</hi> (as the Lord
<hi>Burleigh</hi> tell us) acknowledg'd,<note n="†" place="margin">They are his own words, see Execution of Justice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 16.</note> 
               <q>The Bull of <hi>Pius
Quintus,</hi> for so much as it is against the Queen, is
holden by the English Catholicks for a lawfull Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and a sufficient Discharge of her Subjects Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
and so remains in force; but in some points
touching the Subject, it is altered by the present
Pope: For where in that Bull all her Subjects are
commanded not to obey her, and she being excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
and deposed, all that do obey her are
likewise accursed, which point is perilous to the
Catholicks; for if they obey her, they are in the
Pope's Curse, and if they disobey her, they are in
the Queen's Danger: Therefore the present Pope,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97409:15"/>
to relieve them, hath altered that part of the Bull,
and dispensed with them to obey and serve her,
without peril of Excommunication: which dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
is to endure but till it please the Pope other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to determine.</q>

Power of His Holiness, and the Mother Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the chief Head and Matron, above all
pretended Churches throughout the whole Earth; and
that my Zeal shall be for Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and his Successors,
as the Founder of the True and Ancient Catholick
Faith, against all Heretical Kings, Princes, States,
or Powers, repugnant unto the same. And although
I may pretend, in case of Persecution or otherwise, to
be Heretically disposed, yet in Soul and Conscience I
shall help, aid, and succour the Mother Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
as the True, Ancient, Apostolical Church. I farther
do declare not to act or contrive any manner of thing
prejudicial unto her or her sacred Orders, Doctrines,
Tenents, or Commands, without the leave of her su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Power, or the Authority under her appointed, or
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97409:16"/>
to be appointed; and when so permitted, then to act or
further her Interest more than my own earthly Gain and
Pleasure, as she and her Head, His Holiness and his
Successours, have, or ought to have, the Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
over all Kings, Princes, Estates, or Powers what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
either to deprive them of their Crowns, Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres,

or to set up others in lieu thereof, they
dissenting from the Mother Church, and her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus by all imaginable ways did this Pope pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for the Death or Deposition of that Virgin
Queen;<note place="margin">1581.</note> in order to which he had so possess'd the
Missionaries with his power to dethrone Princes,
that it was offer'd to be prov'd to the World, <q>That
the Priests which were apprehended and executed
for Treason,<note n="*" place="margin">Declaration of the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Her Majest. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, p. 4. 1583. 4to.</note> always restrained their confession of
Allegiance only to the permissive form of the Pope's
Toleration; as for Example: if they were asked
whether they did acknowledge themselves to be
the Queen's Subjects, and would obey her, they
would say Yes, for so they had leave for a time to
doe; but being asked if they would so acknowledg
and obey her any longer than the Pope would so
permit them, or notwithstanding such Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as the Pope would or might give to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
then they either refused to obey, or denied
to answer, or said they could not answer to those
Questions without danger: And at their very Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment,
when they laboured to leave in the
minds of the People and standers by, an opinion
that they were to dye, not for Treason, but for
matter of Faith and Doctrine, they cried out that
they were true Subjects, and did and would obey
Her Majesty. Immediately to prove whether that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97409:16"/>
speech extended to a perpetuity of their Obedience,
or so long time as the Pope so permitted, they were
openly in the place of Judgment asked by the Q's
learned Counsel, whether they would so obey,
and be true Subjects, if the Pope commanded the
contrary; they plainly disclosed themselves in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
saying by the mouth of <hi>Campion, This place</hi>
(meaning the Court of Her Majesties Bench) <hi>hath
no Power to enquire or judge of the Holy Fathers Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;</hi>
and other Answer they would not make.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The very same Account, with some other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
is given us by the<note n="†" place="margin">Important Consid. p. 68.</note> Secular Priests them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
of the Behaviour of Mr. <hi>Campion,</hi> and the
rest; some of whom being asked which part they
would take, if the Pope, or any other by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
should invade the Realm, or which part
ought a good Subject to take, answered, when that
case happened, they would then consider what they
had best doe; others, that they were not yet resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
what to doe; and others positively, that if such
a Deprivation, or Invasion should be made for any
Matter of Faith, they were then bound to take part
with the Pope.</p>
            <p>Nay, so zealous was Mr. <hi>Campion</hi> in defence of
that rebellious Doctrine, that being visited in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
by some Gentlemen of<note n="*" place="margin">Hunting of the Romish Fox. <hi>p.</hi> 146, 147.</note> 
               <hi>Oxford,</hi> one of them
asked him whether he thought the Queen lawfull
Heir or no; to this he made no Answer; but when
the question was put, whether if the Pope invaded
the Land, he would take part with him or the
Queen, he openly replied, he would join with the
Pope, and very earnestly demanded Pen, Ink, and
Paper, with which he signed his Resolution; which
Principle he was so rooted in, that he affirmed in
the Tower to several<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Fowlis,</hi> p. 54.</note> Persons of Quality, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
whether he did acknowledge the Queen to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97409:17"/>
be a lawfull Queen, or did believe her deprived of
her Right, that this Question depends much on the
Fact of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth, whereof he is no Judge,
and therefore refused to answer farther.</p>
            <p>The same loyal Doctrines were vented by several
other Priests the ensuing year,<note place="margin">1582.</note> who affirmed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Hands to the Commissioners who exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
them, That the Pope had power to depose
Princes, and that Her Majesty was not be obeyed
against His Holiness's Bull,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fowlis,</hi> p. 55, 56, 57, 58.</note> who hath Authority to
discharge Subjects of their Allegiance; which all of
them, <hi>viz. Kerby, Cottom, Richardson, Ford, Shert,
Johnson, Hart,</hi> and <hi>Filbee,</hi> agreed in, two of them
only sheltring themselves with this General Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
That they held as the Catholick Church held.
<hi>Johnson</hi> particulary affirming, That if the Pope in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
her Majesty upon a civil Account, he would
take part with Her, but if upon a Matter of Faith,
it was his Duty to assist the Pope.</p>
            <p>In which diligence to poison the Members of

might be the better assisted by that good Spirit which
moved him thereto, His Holiness granted him his

his sins, assuring him that he should merit highly by
the Action, which he terms holy and honourable;
to which the Cardinal added his Prayers and Wishes
for its success.</p>
            <p>This he confessed confirmed his Resolution to kill
his Sovereign,<note place="margin">

And well they might; for as it shewed the

in the many wonderfull preservations of that

to permit the devilish Designs of the Jesuites to be

him so far as to give Thanks for the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;

that they forgot one that was above them, who
made that terrible Fleet the scorn of the world, and
so protected the just Cause of the Queen, and assisted
her Navy, that most of that Armado perished in
the Sea, or were taken, or burnt; so vain a thing
it is to forget and fight against the Almighty, who
blessed where the Pope cursed, and turned the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues
of the Thanksgiving-Jesuite into three Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of Humiliation, for so great a Disappointment
of the Papal Designs, and the entire Destruction of

            <p>Yet could not these wonderfull Disappointments
work any remorse in the Papists, who still la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured,

they designed to seize him; but being prevented by

secure his Person at his return from <hi>Bois de Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
slenderly accompanied; but failing in this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> came to <hi>Paris,</hi> contrary to
the King's express Order, where he was received
with great joy, and soon after, his Party being
numbred, and found considerable, he openly rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
barricadoing the Streets,<note place="margin">

to flie, who made his Escape with very few Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants:
Soon after the King of <hi>Spain</hi> sent six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand Crowns to the Rebels, and the Pope
by solemn Letters applauded the Duke's Zeal, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
him to the Maccabean Heroes, and exhorted
him to go on as he had begun; but here the insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy

receiving the just Reward of his continued Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions.</p>
            <p>Thus were the Designs of wicked men, who prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted

the other threatening the Nobility, and all others,
with the Papal Curse, if they assisted that Heretick,
Persecutour, Excommunicated Person, who was
justly deprived of his Dominions; which were the
mild Expressions with which this meek Servant of
Servants treated that great Prince: And farther, to
shew his Fatherly care of the Rebels, he sent an
Army to their relief, under the Command of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,

            <p>Yet were not these Designs of the Leaguers, and

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Id.</hi> p 433, 438.</note> sufficient to content the Pope, but the
young Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon</hi> hoped for the Crown,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97409:27"/>
and so formed another Party of seditious Persons,
called Thirdlings, among whom was <hi>Perron,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Cardinal; and this Faction also had the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the last Pope, who, to advance this Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
exhorted the States to chuse a Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

he continued the same allowance to the Leaguers,
renewed the same Exhortations, and declared any
other but a Romanist incapable of the Crown. The
Parliament of <hi>Roan</hi> published a severe Edict against
all who adhered to the King; and Discourses were
spread abroad, maintaining, That it was unlawfull
to desire his Conversion, and that such as proposed
or endeavoured it were excommunicated, and ought
to be driven away, lest they should infect the rest;
and the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> enjoined Obedience to
the Pope, and his Legate, declaring that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention

And by this time those few Romanists who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

of <hi>Bourbon</hi> could not be lawfull King, because he
was an Heretick; and therefore they cannot be
blamed for opposing him in obedience to the Pope's
Bulls, and Admonitions: to which, his Holiness's
Legate added another, assuring the Romanists that
the Pope would never consent to the admission of
an Heretick, that such who assisted the King were
in a desperate Condition, and exhorting all to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
to the Pope; and when the Estates were
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97409:29"/>
met, he proposed that all should take an Oath, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to acknowledge the King, though he should be
converted to their Church; nay, so great was his
Fury, that when the Romanists with the King sent
to the States some Propositions for a Treaty, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
the very Proposals to be Heretical, and by his
influence the Doctours of <hi>Sorbon</hi> asserted the same,
as intimating a declared Heretick might be King;
but the Proposition was accepted, and a Conference
agreed on, but with this Clause in the Answer to
the Proposal, That to fight against an Heretical
King is not Treason; yet the Legate entred his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
against the meeting, and the Parisians at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to make the young Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> King:
Nor were things better in the Royal Army, where
the Romanists, whom the King most trusted, were
falling from him; upon which resolving to change
his Religion, his Intensions were no sooner pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
than the Legate forbad all Bishops to absolve
him, pronouncing all that should be assisting to his
reception into the Roman Church excommunicated,
and deprived, and all their Actions in that Affair
null and void.</p>

of <hi>Venice,</hi> if within four and twenty days after the
publication of the Bull they do not revoke their Decrees,
are excommunicated; and if they continue obstinate
three days more, he lays an Interdict upon the whole

            <p>This Bull he expected would gain his point, by
causing the Ecclesiasticks to withdraw themselves,
and that the People, seeing themselves deprived of
Church-Offices, would run into Sedition; but the
Event answered not his Expectation, for the People
joined unanimously with the Senate; but the Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites,
and others, refused to celebrate Mass, upon
which they were banished the Dominions of <hi>Venice;</hi>

Common People: But not succeeding in this, the
Pope published a Jubilee, granting Indulgence to
all but those of Interdicted places; this he expected
would make the People murmur, but he was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in that point too; so that he declared in a full
Consistory that he would have War with the State
of <hi>Venice,</hi> and called the Spaniards to his aid; but
finding the Senate resolute in Defence of their
Rights, he was glad to recall his Bull, and make a
Peace with them, and though he earnestly pressed
for the Restauration of the Jesuites, yet he could
not obtain it.</p>

were very jealous, lest that Order should rob them

were not a little carefull to secure their Land in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>

            </p>

they had kept their words with him: And in <hi>Paris</hi>

affirm, that now the Catholicks were rid of

was much advanced, and therefore she had no reason

            <p>But though, as Secretary <hi>Morris</hi> affirms, there are

Book <hi>Ann.</hi> 1662. had challenged them to call him
to an Account for affirming, that the Rebellion was
raised and promoted, and the King murthered by
the Arts of the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> the Book came to a
fourth Edition, in all which he renewed the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,
and in the last in these words: <hi>I have defied

Evidence of what he asserted should be produced
whenever Authority shall require it.</p>
            <p>I remember once a Jesuite attempted to prove the
truth of the Nag's-Head Ordination, because that
Charge had been laid to our Church some years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any offered to confute it, or to produce the
<hi>Lambeth</hi> Record, which he affirmed was an evident
sign that the thing was true, or else having such
means to confute it they would not have been so
long silent; what then may we think of those Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
who had so heavy a crime charged on them,
and yet for near twenty years together never called
the Accuser to account?<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>The Doctour always refused to produce his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
till required by Authority; only he gives us
this Account, That the Papers of Resolution in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the Murther, when it was found to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
detested, were by the Pope's Order gathered
up and burnt; but a Roman Catholick in <hi>Paris</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to deliver one in his possession, but shewed it
to a Protestant Friend, and related to him the whole
carriage of the Negotiation. And I am sure if the
Protestants had been under such an Imputation, the
Papists would make good use of their silence to
prove their Guilt.</p>
            <p>But farther to shew their aversion to the Royal

they are from being Subjects, or intend to pay him
any Obedience longer than they are governed in such

the Popish Primate, coming through <hi>Brussels,</hi>
refused to kiss the King's Hand, though some offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to introduce him: And to obtain favour with
<hi>Richard Cromwell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1659.</note> he alledged that the Irish Natives
had no affection to the King,<note place="margin">Hist. of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Remon. p. 610.</note> and his Family; and
therefore were fit to be trusted by the Protectour;
and upon his Arrival in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he made it his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
to gain a party there to hinder the King's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration,
promising them great assistance; upon
which the King gave notice of those Contrivances to
<hi>Don Stephano de Gamarro,</hi> the Spanish Ambassadour,
in <hi>Holland,</hi> so that he was recalled to <hi>Rome,</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the danger of the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And (which is a farther Evidence of the Enmity
of that party to the Royal Family) when General</hi>
Monk <hi>was at</hi> London, <hi>in prosecution of that great
and good Design which he afterwards completed,
and had by his prudent Conduct gained the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the People</hi> Monsieur de Bourdeaux, <hi>the French
Ambassadour, told Mr.</hi> Clergis,<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Long</hi>'s Hist. of Plots, p. 87, 88.</note> That Cardinal
<hi>Mazarine</hi> would be glad to have the Honour of his
Friendship, and would assist him faithfully in all his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises;
and that the General might be more confident
of the Cardinal, he assured him that <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi>
kept so strict a League with him, that he did not assume
the Government without his Privity, and was directed
step by step by him, in the progress of that Action; and
therefore if he resolved on that course, he should not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have the Cardinal's Friendship and Counsel in the
Attempt, but a safe Retreat, and honourable Support
in <hi>France,</hi> if he failed in it.</p>
            <p>Soon after His Majesty's Restauration,<note place="margin">1662.</note> which all
the Contrivances of these men could not hinder,
the Jesuites presented a Paper to several persons of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97409:52"/>
Honour, pleading to be included within a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Vote which had been made with reference to all
other Romanists; in which they acknowledge, that
no party in their Church think the Deposing Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
sinfull,<note place="margin">Jesuites Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, p. 112, &amp;c,</note> but themselves, who are by Order of
their General forbidden to meddle with it: But, as
their Answerer observes, this makes them but the
more guilty, seeing their Loyalty depends upon the
Will of their General, which is all they pretend to
be influenced by in this matter: But this is not all,
for they impose upon the World in that Assertion,
there being no such Decree which respects any other
Countrey but <hi>France;</hi> and whereas (if we should
grant them that) they pretend to be bound by it
under pain of Damnation, this likewise is false; for
none of their Constitutions oblige them under so
much as a Venial Sin.</p>
            <p>Therefore the same person advised them to join in
a Subscription of Abhorrence of those Deposing Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Id.</hi> p. 127.</note> which had been too often maintained by
them; but this was a piece of Loyalty to which
they could never arrive.</p>
            <p>The former year some of the Irish Clergy and
Gentry, to make some amends for their Rebellion,
had subscribed that Declaration which Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>
published in the year 1647. which hath since been
called the Irish Remonstrance, and made a great
noise in the World for some years; for no sooner
was an Account of this Loyal Action transmitted to
<hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hist of the Irish Remon. p. 16, 17, 18.</note> but the Internuncio <hi>De Vecchiis,</hi> then Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

his Holiness had condemned it;<note place="margin">Where see the Letters, and p. 513, 514.</note> and Cardinal <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berini,</hi>

               <hi>Anthony Mac Gheoghegan,</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish

against it: And the Theological Faculty at

               <hi>Lovain,</hi> declared that it contained many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Catholick Faith, and ought not to be
signed by any; But Father <hi>Shelton,</hi> and several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Priests, were more particular, who told Father
<hi>Walsh,</hi> the Procurator for the Irish Clergy in this
Affair,<note n="‖" place="margin">p. 84.</note> that they would not subscribe that form,
nor any other, denying a power in the Pope to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the King, or absolve Subjects from their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
because this is a matter of right, controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

a Power to their Superiours to proceed against them

he justifies all that was done at <hi>James-Town</hi> by the

Romish Bishops,<note place="margin">Anno</note> who broke the Peace of 1648. and

the next year,<note place="margin">1666.</note> seriously professed that he durst not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the Pope's Deposing Power, which was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by 7 <hi>Saints, (St.</hi> Thomas <hi>one,) 7 Cardinals,

Letters dissuading them to give any such assurance of
their Loyalty, as being prejudicial to the Cath. Faith,
which was seconded by another from the Internuncio,
and the Bp. of <hi>Ipres,</hi> directed to some of the Synod,
who were very obedient to these Admonitions; for
when Father <hi>Walsh</hi> endeavoured to prove that seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
great Divines had opposed the Deposing Doctrine,
<note n="†" place="margin">p. 657.</note> Father <hi>Nettervile</hi> interrupted him, affirming that
none had asserted the contrary, but a Schismatical
Historian, and a Poet, meaning <hi>Sigibertus Gembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censis,</hi>
and <hi>Dantes Aligherius;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 666.</note> soon after which
they resolved not only not to sign the Remonstrance,
but not to suffer it to be read in the House: And
when the Procuratour desired them to beg his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97409:53"/>
Pardon for the late execrable Rebellion,<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Id.</hi> Pref. p. 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>they
not only refused to ask pardon but so much as to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
there was any need of it;</hi> affirming publickly <hi>that
they knew none at all guilty of any Crime for any thing
done in the War. And when the Lord Lieutenant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
them to give his Majesty some assurance of their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Obedience, in case of any Deposition or Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
from the Pope, they refused even this without
so much as putting it to the Question.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They offered indeed several Forms instead of the
Remonstrance,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Idem.</hi> p. 763.</note> but in none of them renounced the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
Power; in that the Assembly signed at their
breaking up, they disowned the Doctrine, but would
not declare that Doctrine which abetts it unsound
and sinfull; wherein they have been imitated by some
late Writers, who though called upon to affirm it
such, never did it.</p>
            <p>Once indeed they seemed to come something near
what was expected, when their<note n="*" place="margin">p. 675.</note> Chairman told Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Walsh, That it was not out of any prejudice against
the Remonstrance they would not sign it, but because they
thought it more becoming their Dignity and Liberty to
word their own sense; for the rest, they were far from
condemning that Remonstrance or the Subscribers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:</hi>
Yet would they not own this when desired un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Hands, but refused; so that no good being
expected, they were dissolved, leaving an undeniable
Evidence of their aversion to Loyalty, and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the treasonable Doctrine of the Ch. of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after the Dissolution of this Synod the E.<note place="margin">p. 746.</note> of
<hi>Sandwich,</hi> Ambassadour in <hi>Spain,</hi> informed His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
that Primate <hi>Reilly</hi> was emplyed to stir up his
Countrey-men to rebell, upon which a Gurd was set
upon him, and in a little time was sent into <hi>France.</hi>

            <p>The Bp.<note place="margin">1674.</note> of <hi>Ferns</hi> still justified the Rebellion,<note place="margin">

hot between the King of <hi>France</hi> and the present
Pope,<note place="margin">1679.</note> His Holiness had so much of the Spirit of his
Predecessours, who were for asserting their Power
over all the Kingdoms of the World, as to threaten
the King with Excommunication, and that speedily,
if he would not renounce his Claim,<note place="margin">1682.</note> and he was as
good as his word; for the King not being affraid of
his Thunders, and refusing to lose his Right, and
the Assembly of the Clergy joining with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
the Pope sent a Bull of Excommunication to his
Nuncio,<note place="margin">News from <hi>France,</hi> p. 37. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1682. 4to.</note> requiring him to publish it in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;
