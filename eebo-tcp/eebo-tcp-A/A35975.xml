            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

To ayme at performing all this, would be as fond a thought, as to put to Sea in a pair of Oars, with deſign to circle the whole Earth, and viſit both the Poles. Yet ſince upon Mr. Surveyours motion to you, (upon occaſion of what was juſt now, ſo ingeniouſly delivered by our acute, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and judicious Aſſociate D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Goddard</hi> about the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Trees) you have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50630:3"/>
thought good to command me to entertain you with my reflections upon this ſubject, I will in obedience thereunto give you ſuch hints as may ſtir up others, by following them, to make a complete and poliſhed piece of that whereof I ſhall ſet before you only a rough draught; yet it ſhall be compoſed of ſuch naturall and aſſured ſtroaks, as may perſwade you that there is no inſuperable difficulty, nor inſcrutable darkneſs in all this ſo admired progreſs.</p>
            <p>But let us look upon it, ſtep by ſtep; and conſider at every joynt or change, what new ſhape ought in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50630:4"/>
reaſon appear next, and what new product is likely from time to time to ariſe out of the immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding compoſition, ſo tempered, ſo qualified, and ſo accompanyed with all its Concomitant accidents; and we ſhall preſently conclude, that it would have been impoſſible any other thing imaginable ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted out of theſe principles and circumſtances, then what hath been thus born out of Natures fertile womb: And be the ſeed never ſo remote from any appearing affinity with the Plant or Tree that at the laſt groweth out of it; yet by this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50630:4"/>
heedfull ſurvey it will be evident unto us, that as long as water performeth the action of wetting, fire that of burning, the Earth that of conſtipating and giving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence to fluid bodies, and the aire that of mellowing and ripening what is expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to his embraces; in a word, that as long as nature proceedeth in her regular courſe to perform theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar actions which we are daily witneſſes of, and which we find no difficulty to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; ſo long (I ſay) it is impoſſible, that any other thing in the World ſhould grow (for example) out of a little ſhrunk Akehorne,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50630:5"/>
then a ſpread vaſt Oake; or out of a ſingle Bean, then that tall, green, tender Plant ſo furniſhed with ſtalk, leaves, flowers, buds, ſeeds, (all in their ſeverall ſeaſons) which appeareth ſo differing from that dry, hard grain firſt thrown into the Earth. Let us date the beginning of our obſervation from thence. This dry ſhrunk compacted ſubſtance, being buryed ſlightly in the moiſt ground, at a ſeaſon when the approaching Sun (the great <hi>Archeus</hi> and fire of nature) beginning to dilate and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime up to the Superficies of the Earth, that volatile and balſamick ſalt which his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50630:5"/>
remoteneſſe during the Winter had ſuffered to be ſhrunk up together, and condenſed and ſunk deeper towards the Center; muſt of neceſſity receive into its ſubſtance, that ſaline humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity which environeth it, is contiguous to it, and on all hands preſſeth upon it. The immediate effect of this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mecting of the Bean or Akehorne, muſt neceſſarily be that it ſwelleth and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth bigger: for the ſubſtance of the water getting into the very ſubſtance of the grain that lyeth ſoaking in it; thoſe two ſubſtances cannot chooſe but take up a larger room then formerly did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50630:6"/>
long to only one of them ſingle. And from thence it will follow, that the skin which wrappeth up and containeth the ſubſtance of the Bean, muſt needs crack and tear to afford way and liberty to the dilatation of the ſwelled body: which having thus obtained room for it ſelf to perform ſuch actions as in thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are naturall and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to it (whereas, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was ſhut up and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in a cold, dry, and hard outſide) it followeth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently its own ſwing; and in that little naturall body, we may read the fate which hangeth over political ones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:50630:6"/>
when the inferiour Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that ſhould ſtudy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but obedience, have gotten the power into their hands: for then every one of them following their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous inclinations, the whole is brought into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; and that is deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which every one in their tumultuary way aimed to gain the Maſtery of; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a ſuperiour Architect, as in the preſent caſe of our bleeding Nation,
<q>everſo miſſus ſuccurere ſeclo,</q>
do come to draw light and order, out of that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and confuſion. It will
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50630:7"/>
happen then to this ſwollen Bean, now broken priſon, that the fiery parts of it will work to gain dominion of the watry ones; and they calling the cold and dry ones to their ſeveral aides, will make a violent agitation through the whole maſſe, working and kneading the one into the other. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine motion, will cauſe a greater dilatation of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſo in combuſtion, then the firſt humecting of it did. For, the naturall action of fire being to ſtream out from its Center on all hands in a continued floud of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly rarifyed atomes; and they carrying along
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50630:7"/>
with them as continued a ſequel of moiſt and viſcous ones; it will neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that they muſt have a larger field then originally they had to play their game in. Thus far of this work belongeth to fermentation, which if it grow ſo violent that the fiery and ſpirituall parts do get quite looſe from the viſcous ones; then that which followeth, is a totall Putrefaction, Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and Deſtruction of the compound: But if it be kept within its due limits, then the body in which it was wrought, is raiſed to a nobler pitch, and the Ethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall ſpirits of it are actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50630:8"/>
and put in poſſeſſion of their native vertue; and the feculent, inſipide, earthy ones are caſt out from having any Society with them. But you do not expect from me (my honoured hearers) that I ſhould diſcuſs the Doctrine of fermentation to the utmoſt ſcope and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of it; which as it is one of the nobleſt and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellenteſt works of nature, and indeed the key to enter into the knowledge of all the actions and changes that are wrought under the Sun; ſo it requireth a particular treatiſe entirely to it ſelf, and will take up a whole man to draw a complete Map of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50630:8"/>
its Empire. He will find that there is no diſeaſe in mans body, but ſpringeth from fermentation; which when it groweth ſo violent and unruly, that the fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted humours can no longer be contained within their oppreſſed veſſels, or that it is continued ſo long, that the ſpirits fly quite away, and thereby deliver over the remaining Maſs to Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Rottenneſs; Death, which is an eſſentiall diſſolution of the whole compound, muſt neceſſarily follow. He will find that the cures of all diſeaſes do proceed from ſometimes raiſing fermentaton to a due
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50630:9"/>
pitch, that it may caſt off what is hurtfull to the whole compound; and otherwhiles precipitating it, ſo that all the tumultuary motions of it may be compoſed, and a perfect calm may be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in place of it. And laſtly, (not to trouble you with too many particulars, ariſing out of a digreſſion) he will find that when ever nature intendeth the betterment of any body, ſhe beginneth with diſſolving and fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in its due liquor; that ſo each eſſential part may be ſevered from his fellow, and refined to a nobler ſtate then it enjoyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and then joyned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50630:9"/>
in a much perfecter ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety with his equally enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled companions, after the incorrigible <hi>faeces</hi> are thrown from their harmony and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Thus plain Clay with water from Heaven, may be brought to a chriſtaline puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and permanence; and Gold to one of thoſe gems, which in the <hi>Apocalips</hi> we are told ſerve for the Pavement of the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Find but a <hi>menſtruum</hi> of its own nature, in which it may be radically diſſolved and fermented; and the reſt of the work will be eaſie. But to make our Bean grow, we need not ſo great curioſity; and yet
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50630:10"/>
give me leave to ſay, the linear way of the one, is not more plain and eaſie than that of the other, to him that knoweth them. But be this how it will: As to the Bean, although the ſwelling and burſting forth of the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and viſcous parts of it, will be towards all ſides, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of fire, which ſtreameth out from the center every way to the circumference, yet it will be moſt efficacious up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards towards the air, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it meeteth with leſſe reſiſtance that way, than any other: For downwards the Earth lyeth more compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than it doth over the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50630:10"/>
grain, it having been ſtirred and broken to make the Mould looſe and porous; and beſides, there is a great quantity of it, which the further you go downwards, groweth the more difficultly penetrable; whereas, from the grain to the ſuperficies of the Earth, and to the free air, the journey is very ſmall, and no obſtacles in the way, by reaſon the Sun, Air, Dew and Rain do ſtill work upon it to make it light and ſpungy. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards then, and towards the air muſt be the ſpeedieſt and the greateſt concourſe of theſe hot and viſcous ſtreams; which coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50630:11"/>
the cold air, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded by it on every hand, they contract themſelves into ſuch a figure, as is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to reſiſt the aſſaults of ſuch an enemy; which is the circular one: for (to ſpeak phyſically) the ambient air preſſing theſe ſtreams on all ſides, reduceth them into the narroweſt room poſſible to ſerve them: and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular figure being the moſt capacious of all others what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, the cold air conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them into it, that ſo moſt matter may be contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in leaſt ſpace. In the mean time, the ſtreams out of the cracked skin of the Bean downwards and ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50630:11"/>
are not altogether inefficacious, though not ſo vigorous as thoſe that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend upwards towards the air. There will be this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the deſcending or ſpreading parts, which flow out of the fermenting maſs; that the firſt will be hot, moiſt, aiery, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently green and tender ones; the others will be more dry, cold, earthy; and therefore rough, hard and white; whoſe hardneſſe and roughneſſe will alſo be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by the Earths preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon it. Thus then the root is formed, which drawing continually new
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50630:12"/>
juyce to it from the moiſt Earth that environeth it, and abounding with heat that ſtill digeſteth and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limeth up the moiſture it ſucketh in; and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward agents (that is, the Sun and Aire) performing alſo their parts; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that new digeſted and ſpiritual juyce is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſublimed up into that round, green, tender part, which was ſprung up out of the Earth into the aire; and that now we may call the ſtalk. Thus both the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and the extern heat, do concur to enlarge this plant, by filling both the root and the ſtalk of it with continual
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50630:12"/>
new moiſture: whereof the one being expoſed to the Sun and Winde, muſt needs grow rough and hard on the out-ſide; to defend from outward injuries of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the inner-part that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth tender and juicy, and would elſe be ſoon nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in its aſcending; and the other thruſteth down conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually hard parts deeper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Earth, whereby it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth firm and able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the agitations of the wind, without being eaſily eradicated. Now it fareth with the plant, as with a kindled fire of wood; the more fewell is applyed to feed it, the more groweth
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50630:13"/>
the heat: ſo here, the daily and hourly accrewing of new balſamick juyce, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth the heat that is within the plant; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently there is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually more and more juyce ſent upwards. Thus the ſtalk groweth higher. But the further that this aſcending juice goeth from the maine Center of it that ſublimed it up, the weaker and fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it becometh, and the leſs able to reſiſt the invaſions of the cold ambient aire. So that, when it can creep up no higher, it ſettleth there: Yet continually the innate heat ſublimeth up more and more juicy, which not being
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50630:13"/>
able to pierce the skin that it meeteth with at its journys end, it ſwelleth there into a button, that groweth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually bigger and bigger, till at length the skin that enwrappeth this ſubliming and daily more digeſted juyce, not being able any longer to contain the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and activity of it, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and from that cloven button or knot, new juyce aſcendeth in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and progreſs as before; till at a juſt diſtance, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the cauſes that produce it, a new knot is made; And ſo from one to another, every one leſs then the other, till at length
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50630:14"/>
there wanteth juyce to drive the Plant any higher; and withall, the ſubliming heat groweth fainter at ſo great a diſtance; and the Sun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to grow leſs active upon it; And in a word, the whole oeconomy of nature conſpireth to ſet here a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to the extenſion of the Plant. Some plants do uſe to ſhoot only upwards; but in others, when the but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton is forced aſunder by the aſcending juyce; that juyce puſheth out as well to the ſides as upwards; and ſo a branch is made, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the main ſtock: And it hapneth that there do break out ſo many ſuch
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50630:14"/>
branches, as there are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current circumſtances and accidents (ſuch as we have here mentioned) to form them. But when nature hath ſet a period to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of her growing Plant, and is as it were wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of teeming any longer with ſuch ſtrong and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous iſſues (that is to ſay, that the innate heat, the juyce, and the Sun, do begin to flag in their operations, (for the reaſons I have touched) and yet never conſenting to be idle and ſit ſtill, ſhe beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth her ſelf to works of leſs robuſtuous force; and refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtill more and more by gentle ſublimations and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purations,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50630:15"/>
the juyce ſhe hath brought up thus high, ſhe continually maketh it caſt off the groſſer parts, which ſtick by the way as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nimble enough to riſe higher, nor ſubtill enough to paſs through thoſe ſtreight channels which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford the refined ſpirits an eaſie courſe. Yet are not theſe groſs parts without employment (I call them groſſe, only in reſpect of the purer ſpirit; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they are much more ſubtill and concocted, then thoſe which remain in the ſtalk, trunk, or bark of the plant) it is true, they are not able to go along with the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50630:15"/>
aethereal ſpirit, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a higher flight, as you ſhall by and by hear. And they are continually encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with hourly ſupplies of like groſs or ſubtill parts as you will pleaſe to call them: for indeed they are either, or both; ſubtill in reſpect of the groſſer juyce they are ſublimed from, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth below in the body and trunk of the plant; And groſs in reſpect of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſpirit and balſamick oyle that is rectifyed from them. This perpetuall new concourſe of freſh mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the branches, which grow too full to contain it, is the cauſe of their cleaving
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50630:16"/>
in ſeveral places where this juyce puſheth to get out. If it be very viſcous and unctuous, and have been long concocted by the Sun with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and the innate heat within, before it breaketh out; it ſhoweth it ſelf in a gummy ſubſtance, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth in it the nature of the whole Plant; as I ſhall hereafter convince experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, beſides the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the reaſon that concludeth it muſt be ſo. But if nothing have interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to hinder or alter the ordinary courſe; then, this more watry then unctuous juyce, making its way into the aire through the tender
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50630:16"/>
skin of the branch or ſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lk, ſuffereth all the like actions upon it as were formerly wrought upon the firſt juyce that broke out of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Bean or Akehorne; and ſo it beginneth to be formed there into a new Plant, of a ſhape, figure, and nature proportioned to the great one it ſhooteth from. Firſt, a thridde ſhooteth out in a direct line, that we may fitly call the ſtalk of this new little Plant; and at a diſtance adequate to the heat that ſublimeth and puſheth it out, and to the cold aire that nippeth and ſhrinketh it into a button, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he firſt knot is formed in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50630:17"/>
this little ſtalk: from whence new ſtreames or thredds are puſhed out, both forwards and ſide-wayes, as we have formerly explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the firſt groſſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the bulky plant. Theſe thredds that are thus ſpun out every way one from another, do grow to be ſo near one another, that the ſteams which neceſſarily muſt accompany them (for whereſoever heat driveth out ſtore of moiſture, there cannot chooſe but be an atmoſphere of emanations environing and beſieging, as I may ſay the main ſtream) do eaſily mingle with one another; and being of a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50630:17"/>
viſcous and adhaeſive nature (as all ſuch moiſt and hot emanations muſt neceſſarily be) they fill up with their glewy matter the intervalls between the main threds. Which we may compare, not improperly to a curious Work-womans filling up of Flanders-lace with fine thred: in the doing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſhe interweaveth ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly the thred ſhe bringeth, with thoſe ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derds of threds (as I may call them) that ſhe already findeth in her work before her, that whiles ſhe filleth up all the vacuities, ſhe ſtill leaveth thoſe main threds ſo diſcernable, that your
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50630:18"/>
eye can after all diſtinguiſh the work of the Pattern as clearly as if there had been nothing done to it. And ſo in this filling up the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of the new little Plant, you ſee plainly all the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news and threds of it after the viſcous ſteames which hang about them are plaited and wrought into a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate ſubſtance, that is jag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged or dentelated according as the main threds are puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth to be longer or ſhorter, which dependeth upon the heat that carryeth the viſcous parts with it. And thus the leaf, a ſecond Plant is formed out of the branches and twigs of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50630:18"/>
firſt, retaining the ſhape, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and other qualities of it. Now all the while that this is doing with the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer parts, which the rectify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirit caſteth off; The heat which rectifyeth and ſublimeth it, puſheth forth this elaborate juyce into more tender ſubſtances, more abounding with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and ſpirits; Eſpecially at the extremity of the branches, where the ſolid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the abounding humour groweth (as before in the riſing of it in the ſtalk of the Bean, or in the body of the Oak) into a button; but the more volatile and leſſe ſubſtantial part of this
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50630:19"/>
highly rectifyed juyce or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther new ſpirit, is ſpread round about it in thin ſheets; which being full of the aereal and ſulphureous parts of this rectifyed ſpirit (which here by the iterated rectifications, becometh like an ardent water) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth the eyes with varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of colours, and the noſe with pleaſantneſſe of ſmell (for ſulphur is the univerſal great painter and perfumer of the world) but being of ſo volatile a nature as the much refining and often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying it, reduceth it to be of; theſe flowers are not of long durance, but ſoon fade and fall away, as alſo their
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50630:19"/>
beautifull and odorous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits exhale from their dead and withered habitations. But all this while that this aethereal or wild ſpirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>createth himſelf thus in theſe tranſitory flowers; a more ſolid and ſubſtantiall one, and that endureth a more vigorous concoction, (as in diſtillations, where the balſamick oyle cometh laſt) filleth and ſwelleth the button that hath by this time loſt his gay companions, the faded flowers. And as it groweth bigger, it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth alſo ſofter and tenderer in the whole bulk of it. For, the Sun ſtill draweth to the outſide, the ſubtileſt, the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50630:20"/>
moſt jucy, and the moſt aereall parts of it: and therefore all that ſubſtance muſt be ſoft, mellow, and tender; only the extremity and the laſt ſuperficies of the outſide, muſt needs have contracted ſome hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and roughneſſe, from the coldneſſe of the aire, and the biting ſharpneſſe of the wind, which maketh the skin of a Pear, or Apple, or Walnut, rougher and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then the pulpy tender ſubſtance next adjoyning to it. Yet out of the courſe here ſet down, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that towards the center of this tender ſubſtance there muſt needs be ſome
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50630:20"/>
hard, dry, and rough mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For, ſeeing that the Sunne from without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth to the ſuperficies of the fruit the moſt ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and aery parts of the aſcending juyce; and that on the other ſide the innate heat from within driveth it out, and extendeth it from the Center to the ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: It is impoſſible but that about the middle from whence all this attraction and expulſion of tender juyce is made, there muſt remain ſtore of Earthy parts deprived of moiſture, and baked into a hard nucleous ſubſtance, containing much of fire; though little of aire
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50630:21"/>
and water in it. For it is the nature of fire to incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate it ſelf with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it baketh and calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; as you have a ſenſible experience in the calcining of Antimony by a burning-glaſſe, when the calcined body encreaſeth much in weight, though at the ſame time the fire driveth away a wonderfull quantity of the moiſt and volatile parts of the ſmoaking maſs. This button, thus dilated and brought to this paſs, we call the fruit of the plant: whoſe harder part, encloſeth oftentimes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is not ſo hard as it is dry. And the reaſon of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50630:21"/>
this is, that the outſide or ſuperficies of this Earthy ſubſtance, is become ſo exceeding hard by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring cauſes which make it ſo, that no moiſture (or at leaſt in no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable quantity) can ſoak through it. And then, the action of heat being conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually prevalent upon what ha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h no ſupply of moiſture, it muſt neceſſarily follow that all the ſubſtance which is encloſed within that hard ſuperficies, muſt needs grow dryer and dryer; till at length it becometh like fine ſubtile duſt compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together; which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelf to be ſo, aſoon
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50630:22"/>
as it is bruiſed out of the husk that containeth it: as we daily ſee in Corn ground at a Mill; and it is as evident in the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells or little ſeeds of Peares, Apples, Orenges, Almonds, and the like; if you work in like manner upon them, after they are throughly dryed. Yet this dryneſſe is not to ſuch a degree, as when in Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by violence of fire the moiſt and volatile Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall parts of a body are entirely driven away. For here the agents being gentle and naturall ones, and the ambient moiſture and cold defending the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50630:22"/>
ſeed from exceſſe of drought and heat, and the whole courſe of this progreſſe tending rather to Fixation then to Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination; It happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parcell of this compacted duſt, the nature of the whole Plant reſideth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly and entirely; as it were, contracted into a ſmall quantity. For, the juyce which was firſt in the button, (that is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the fruit) and had paſſed from the root through the manifold va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of the divers parts of the Plant, and had ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red much concoction and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50630:23"/>
depuration, partly from the Sun and partly from the inward heat impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in that harder ſtony part about the middle of the fruit; is by theſe paſſages, ſtrainings, concoctions, and ſublimations, become at length to be of the nature of a tincture extracted out of the whole plant; and is at laſt dryed up into a kind of Magiſtery, full of Fire and of Salt. This is that which we call the Seed; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing buryed in the Earth, and ſoaked with fitting humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in ſuch ſort as we have here at large declared, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on foot this work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, and repeateth over
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50630:23"/>
again all that we have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therther obſerved in this long progreſſe: in which the ſteadineſſe of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Architects hand that ſteereth and governeth it, is never enough to he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired; who hath ſet on foot ſuch an exact concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of divers and moſt diſtinct cauſes, to conſpire all to one and the ſame end, that ſtill in generall nature ariveth to her deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned period without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruſtrated of the ſcope ſhe levelleth at. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a man that ſhould ſtay his conſideration at every joynt of this long carreer, and ſhould reflect how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50630:24"/>
ſome little circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in ſo vaſt a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of them might be turned awry (as when an atome of duſt falleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the wheeles of a nice clock) or rather, how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult it muſt needs be for one ſingle governour to keep them all in their due aequilibrity; might be apt to conclude that not one of ten thouſand ſhould prove as it doth. And he that ſhould look bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the two extreme terms, the beginning and the completing of a plant, might think there were a perpetuall miracle in the production of vegetables,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50630:24"/>
and might be excuſed for having recourſe to a <hi>vis formatrix,</hi> and ſuch other inſignificant terms. But another that conſidereth the whole courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſet on foot by God Almighty for this admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable work; and fixeth his foot at every particular joynt, not ſtirring it from thence till he have fully examined and diſcuſſed what muſt neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low out of ſuch or ſuch matter, in ſuch or ſuch circumſtances, ſo and ſo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, and ſo and ſo wrought upon; will evident<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that it is throughout impoſſible, any thing ſhould
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50630:25"/>
happen in it otherwiſe then juſt what and how it doth. And it is want of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and of judgement, which maketh men fly to occult and imaginary quali<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies, to ſhroud their ignorance under incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable termes: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as nature in her ſelf is pervious and open to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane diſcovery, if a due courſe be taken to diſſect and ſurvay her.</p>
            <p>Out of what I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of the progreſſe of Nature in the growth of Trees, and of all manner of Plants, it will be eaſie to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie ſuch Queſtions and Doubts concerning them,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50630:25"/>
as at the firſt ſight may ſeem full of difficulty. As for example; why the grain of a tree ſhould affect ſuch or ſuch a ſituation and tendence in reſpect of the great Univerſe, which ſome ſhallow Clerkes will have paſſe among the recondite Myſteries of Nature, ſhut up to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall eyes; further then that they will have a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret inſtinct and ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be between Plants and the polar Star. All which is nothing but this, that the tender plant at its firſt puſhing forth, being check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ambient aire, and warmed by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livening
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50630:26"/>
Sunne; is moſt ſtreightned by the cold Earthy atomes which are drawn by the Sunne from the Poles to the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator. For there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a conſtant perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all courſe of them that way (as I have ſhewed in my Book of Bodies) ſuch things as lie in their Channell muſt neceſſarily be affected with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually repeated ſtroaks. And that ſide of them which is expoſed to their immediate blowes, muſt be moſt ſenſible of them. On the other ſide the Sunne with his warme and moiſt Regiment of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50630:26"/>
atomes, embracing the oppoſite part of the plant, muſt needs work a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect to the other. And thus you ſee a plain and evident reaſon, why one ſide of the plant cannot fail of being cloſe, hard, and heavy in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the other, and tending to ſome acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe rather then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect round. The other will be ſpungy, tender, light, and dilated; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving its Figure enlarged beyond roundneſſe. Now this firſt impreſſion ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for a Rule to what afterwards ſhall follow, and the outward caſe of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50630:27"/>
the plant, being as it were a mould to caſt the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding juyce in; it will follow that at every Year, or Moneth, or Week, (according to the nature of the plant) when new juyce is ſublimed up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hardned caſe, and that this new juyce diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth the caſe to make room for it ſelf, it will take ſuch ply and Figure, acuminated on the one ſide and obtuſe on the other, as the caſe alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath, and is apt to give. This will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated every year in Trees and in ſuch plants as count their livelihood by years.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50630:27"/>
And by theſe circles of the grain, you ſhall not onely know how the Tree grew, where it was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in regard of North and South; but alſo how old it is. And if you will tranſplant it to another place, you muſt have a care to ſet it in the ſame Situation it firſt grew in; for otherwiſe, expoſing the tender, mellow, South-ſide of the Tree, to the ſharp, hard wedges of the Northern aire, they will ſo cleave and batter it, that in a little while it will exhale its ſpirits and dye. And the ſame reaſon obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50630:28"/>
alſo, that every piece of wood, even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is dead and hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, be Magneticall and have reſpective Poles to the Univerſe. For, the conſtant courſe of one ſort of atomes run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning one way through it, muſt needs have bored and wrought ſuch figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Channells as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to admit ſuch figured and qualified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes as they are, and to reject and repell others of a different nature and formation: In ſuch ſort as I have at large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed in my above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Treatiſe, where
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50630:28"/>
I ſet down the whole Doctrine of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone and its Phoenomens, and do give the reaſons of them. From the ſame cauſe it will follow, that if you turn a piece of wood into a Sphere, or Cylinder, or other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Figure, and put it into the water, one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ſide of it will always ſink, and the other ſwim out of the water. And out of what I have ſaid, the reaſon is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, why after much drought in a hot Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Trees and Plants will languiſh, wither and look as though they were
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50630:29"/>
dead, till ſome Rain do fall to cure their ſickneſſe; and then all Vegetables take a new green habit, as though a ſecond Spring were come to animate them. All which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but that the long continued ſcorching Beames of the Sunne had Exhauſted all Humidity from the Plants: And then, freſh moiſture co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Rootes, it is ſublimed thence into the ſtalkes, and maketh a new Germination and Leaves in the manner I have declared.</p>
            <p>Many other ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequencies would irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gably
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50630:29"/>
follow out of the premiſed principles, which would be too long to purſue further here. It is enough to have given the hint of thus much; after which any ordinary reflection will retrive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable other conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. But I think it will not appeare tedious to you that I touch a little upon what courſe may repaire a decaying Plant; or exceedingly augment the vertue of a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous one; ſince not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Philoſophy of it is pleaſing and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; but alſo the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of it may be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50630:30"/>
to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and uſefull (with due Analogy) even to humane bodyes. The Sickneſſe, and in the end the Death of a Plant, in its naturall courſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from want of that balſamick Saline juyce which I have ſaid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it Swell, Germi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and Augment it ſelf. This want may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, either from a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of it in the place where the Plant groweth, as when it is in a barren ſoyle or bad aire; or from a defect in the Plant it ſelf, that hath not vigour ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50630:30"/>
to attract it though it be within the ſphere of it, as when the Root is become ſo hard, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and cold, as that it hath loſt its Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Functions. Now both theſe may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medyed in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, by one and the ſame Phyſick. It is not every humidity that is of a prolifike nature. If water have not her fire in her, ſhe will availe little to make Plants fructifie. The watering of ſoyle with cold hungry ſprings, doth little good. Whereas muddy Saline waters brought to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50630:31"/>
a piece of ground, do enrich it much. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſhowers, eſpecially in the Aequinox Seaſons, are very fruitfull. But above all, well digeſted Dew, maketh all Plants luxuriat and proſper moſt. Now what may it be that endeweth theſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors with ſuch proli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fike vertue? The meer water which is common to them all, cannot be it. There muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe encloſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it, unto which the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſerveth but for a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle. Examine it by the Spagyrick Art, and you will find it is nothing

elſe but a nitrous ſalt which is dilated in the water. It is this Salt which giveth foecundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to all things. And from this Salt (rightly underſtood) not onely all Vegetables, but alſo all Mineralls draw their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</p>
            <p>Here, it were not from the purpoſe to put you in minde how the Ancient Poets (who compriſed their deepeſt wiſdome in familiar Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles) tell us long ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of their Salt-begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Goddeſſe, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umbrated their beſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of nature under

Saline veiles. But I ſhould be too prolixe if I hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted too far every chace that riſeth before me in this copious Forreſt. I will come back to my own and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers plain experiences. By the help of plain Salt-Peter, dilated in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and mingled with ſome other fit Earthy ſubſtance that may fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarize it a little with the corn into which I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to introduce it, I have made the barreneſt ground farre out-goe the richeſt in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a prodigiouſly plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull harveſt. I have
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50630:32"/>
ſeen hemp-ſeed ſoaked in this Liquor, that hath in the due time made ſuch Plants ariſe, as for the tallneſſe and hardneſſe of them, ſeemed rather to be Coppice wood of fourteen yeares growth at leaſt, then plain hemp. The Fathers of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine at <hi>Paris,</hi> doe ſtill keep by them for a Monument (and indeed it is an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble one) a Plant of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley conſiſting of 249. ſtalkes, Springing from one Root or Grain of Barley, in which they counted above 18000. Grains or ſeeds of Barley. But
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50630:33"/>
doe you think that it is barely the Salt-Peter imbibed into the Seed or Root, which cauſeth this Fertility? no; that would be ſoon exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and could not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh matter to ſo vaſt a progeny. The Salt-Peter there, is like a Magnes which attracteth a like Salt that Foecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dateth the Aire, and that gave cauſe to the Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mopolite to ſay, there is in the Aire a hidden food of life. Such Aires as are moſt impregnated with this benigne fire, are healthfull to live in. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which abound with
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50630:33"/>
Earthy exhalations or Mariſhy vapours, and have little balſamick Salt in them, are as unſound. This is the food of the Lungs, and the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Spirits. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Drebell,</hi> having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a great quantity of this into a narrow room, could recreate and revive his languiſhing gueſts in his ſtrait houſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der water, when they had fed upon all the balſome that was in the Aire ſhut up with them; by opening a Fiole that dilated it ſelf with freſh Spirits into that ſtale depredated and exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50630:34"/>

Now in this Salt are encloſed the Seminary vertues of all things. For, what is it, but a pure extract drawn by the Suns-beames from all the bodies that he darteth his Rayes upon, and ſublimed up to ſuch a height of place as leaveth all feculence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it, and is there in that exalted R<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Therefore I wonder not to ſee any ſort of hearbe grow upon the higheſt Towers, where it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain no man ever came to ſow that Plant. And the Loadſtone or Magnes of a like ſubſtance (though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing near ſo pure) that is in the Earth, the creeping toad there, ſucketh and pulleth down this flying Dragon to it; and both of them do become one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And thus you ſee plainly and familiarly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated the great Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme of the Smaragdine Table; <hi>That what is above,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50630:36"/>
is like what is below. The Sun is the Father, the Moon is the Mother; the Earth is the Matrix wherein this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is hatched; and the Aire conveyed it thither.</hi> This Univerſall Spirit then being Homogeneall to all things, and being in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Spirit of Life, not onely to Plants, but to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals alſo: were it not worth the labour to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it as uſefull to mens bodyes, as to the repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Plants? <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> purchaſed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a Magician, for making all ſorts of Fruit grow plentifully and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the depth of a hard

Gold is of the ſame Nature as this aethereall Spirit; or rather, it is nothing but it, firſt corporifyed in a pure place, and then ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to a perfect Fixation. <hi>Raymund Lully</hi> in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Treatiſe <hi>de inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione operanti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

there is no doubt but it would prove a kinde of Tree of Life to us. It is of it ſelf too firmly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for any Agent upon Earth to diſſolve it. But peradventure the Mother that bore him, may rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crudate him and reduce him back into his firſt volatile principles.</p>
            <p>Enough, if not too much is ſaid of theſe Curioſities by way of digreſſion, and to entertain you (Noble Auditors) with pleaſing variety; Let us come back to our Plant, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire if it be not poſſible to render it perpetuall, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to convert it into a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50630:37"/>
permanent ſubſtance and ſtate, no longer ſubject to the Viciſſitudes of time; and outward Agents, that deſtroy all things: So to bring it to a kind of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed body, ſuch as we hope ours will be after the Reſurrection. <hi>Quercetanus</hi> the famous Phyſician of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth telleth us a wonderfull ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a <hi>Polonian</hi> Doctor that ſhewed him a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen glaſſes Hermetically Sealed, in each of which was a different Plant; for example, a Roſe in one, a Tulip in another, a Clove-Gilly-flower in a third; adſo of the reſt. When
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50630:38"/>
he offered theſe Glaſſes to your firſt view, you ſaw nothing in them but a heap of Aſhes in the bottom. As ſoon as he held ſome gentle heate under any of them, preſently there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe out of the Aſhes, the Idaea of a Flower; the Flower and the Stalk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to thoſe Aſhes; and it would ſhoot up and ſpread abroad to the due height and juſt dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſuch a Flower; and had perfect Colour, Shape, Magnitude, and all other accidents, as if it were really that very Flower. But when ever you drew the heate from it, as the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50630:38"/>
Glaſſe and the encloſed Aire and matter within it grew to cool by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, ſo would this Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſink down by little and little, till at length it would bury it ſelf in its bed of Aſhes. And thus it would doe as often as you expoſed it to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heate, or withdrew it from it. I confeſſe it would be no ſmall delight to me to ſee this experiment, with all the circumſtances that <hi>Quercetan</hi> ſetteth down. <hi>Athanaſius Kircherus</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> aſſured me he had done it; and gave me the proc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſe of it. But no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of mine could effect
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50630:39"/>
it. Another I did, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Author; and I found it exactly true as he recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it. It is worth your knowing. I calcined a good quantity of Nettles, Roots, Stalks, Leaves, Flowers; in a word the whole Plant. He produceth the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this very Plant; and I would not vary in the leaſt circumſtance from what he taught. With fair water I made a lye of theſe Aſhes; which I filtred from the inſipide Earth. This lye was expoſed by me in the due ſeaſon to have the Froſt congeale it. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the whole work
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50630:39"/>
in this very houſe where I have now the honour to diſcourſe to you. I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined them in the fair and large Laboratory, that I had erected under the Lodgings of the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Reader: And I expoſed the lye to congeale in the Window of my Library, among my Lodgings at the end of your Great Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery. <hi>Hans Hunneades</hi> the <hi>Hungarian,</hi> was my ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator. And it is moſt true, that when the water was congealed into ice, there appeared to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Nettles fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen in the ice. They had not the colour of Nettles. No
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50630:40"/>
greenneſſe accompanyed them. They were white. But otherwiſe, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any Painter to delineate a throng of Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles more exactly, then they were deſigned in the water. As ſoon as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was melted, all theſe Idaeall ſhapes vaniſhed: but as ſoon as it was congeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again, they preſently appeared afreſh. And this game I had ſeverall times with them, and brought Doctor <hi>Mayerne</hi> to ſee it; who I remember was as much delighted with it as my ſelfe. What could be the reaſon of this Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomen? There is no doubt
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50630:40"/>
but that a main part of the Eſſentiall ſubſtance of a Plant is contained in his fixed Salt. This will admit no change into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature; but will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be full of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and vertues of the Plant it is derived from; but for want of the vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Armoniacall and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureall parts, it is depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of colour. If all the Eſſentiall parts could be preſerved, in the ſevering and purifying of them, I ſee no reaſon but at the reunion of them, the entire Plant might appeare in its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete perfection, ſo one could finde a fit medium
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50630:41"/>
to dilate it in. Were not this then a true <hi>Palingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> of the originall Plant? I doubt it would not be ſo. For ſpeaking rigorouſly, I cannot allow Plants to have Life. They are not <hi>Se Moventia,</hi> They have not a principle of motion within them. It is the operation of outward A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents upon them, that ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on foot all the dance we have above ſo heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerved, and which ſo near imitateth the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Life. And if it be not a living thing, then it is all of it in perpetuall Fluxe and Change, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having any part of it
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50630:41"/>
enjoy a fixed and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>Being,</hi> for the leaſt moments ſpace; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, there can be no Reſurrection of it after once it is deſtroyed, ſince it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was at any time a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate <hi>It,</hi> or <hi>Thing</hi>; But as Coales are made of wood by the action of Fire upon it; and Aſhes again of them, and Glaſſe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes; each of them a quite different ſubſtance from what the precedent was: So, I conceive that a new aereall body and thing is made out of the Plant that furniſhed matter for this new ſubſtance, and whoſe ſubſtantiall form is
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50630:42"/>
totally deſtroyed, and a new one produced into the World; which is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with many acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents like unto many of thoſe that belonged to the precedent ſubſtance. I remember another pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty experiment that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Daviſſon</hi> ſhewed me in his Laboratory at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> He had been draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Oyle and Spirit of a certain kind of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Gumme: And it ſo happened that the Glaſſe along which it roſe; was all covered over on the inſide with Portraitures of Firre-Trees (from whence that reſin diſtilled) ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50630:42"/>
done that no Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the World could have drawn their ſhapes more compleatly. The like hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to me once in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling the Gumme of Cherry-Trees. But none of theſe Idaeas doe come ſo neare unto the reall <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingeneſis,</hi> as what I have done more then once up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Cray-Fiſhes. Waſh them clean from any Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe; and boyle them very throughly (at leaſt two houres ſpace) in ſufficient quantity of faire water. Keep this decoction, and put Creviſſes into a Glaſſe-Limbeck, and diſtill all the Liquor that will ariſe
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50630:43"/>
from them; which keep by it ſelf. Then calcine the Fiſhes in a reverbera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Furnace, and extract their Salt with your firſt decoction; which filter, and then evaporate the humidity. Upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Salt poure your diſtilled Liquor, and ſet i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Theſe you muſt feed with bloud of an Oxe, till they be as big as pretty large but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, then put them into a wooden paile of River<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water and Oxe bloud,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50630:43"/>
changing the water and bloud every third day; and ſo you may bring them on to what bigneſſe you pleaſe.</p>
            <p>All this leadeth me to ſpeak ſomething of the Reſurrection of humane bodyes. There we may find ſome firm and ſolid footing. Hitherto we have wandered up and down in the Mazes of Fleeting mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>quae nunquam in eodem ſtatu permanet.</hi> And with great truth did <hi>Job</hi> apply that expreſſion to the State of men living in this World. But as ſoon as we ſhall have put off our frail Mortality, we ſhall be in a ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manence
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50630:44"/>
and immutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Not onely whiles the Soul is ſeperated from her Earthy Companion, but when ſhe ſhall be cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again, that new fleſh will partake of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of her glorious Mate. But why doe I call it new fleſh? I may be pardoned for doing ſo, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the new qualities and endowments it ſhall have put on. But otherwiſe, in ſubſtance and reality, it is the ſame, the very ſame, that (for example) accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed me in this long and tedious Pilgrimage upon Earth. How is this? If a Caniball ſhould feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50630:44"/>
my body, and convert it into the ſubſtance of his, can both of us riſe again with the ſame bodyes we enjoyed here? Yes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt we may. And I conceive, that the taking away of this difficulty, which hath ſo highly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed even the beſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, will be ſo welcome a performance to them who yet have not met with it; that for its ſake you will pardon the tediouſneſſe and courſeneſſe of all I have hitherto ſaid. And with that, I will ceaſe further troubling you. But let us firſt rightly underſtand one another. I doe not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50630:45"/>
to ſhew here how this great work is wrought: nor much leſſe to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that it will follow out of the force of nature, after the great dayes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration hath calcined the whole Maſſe of Matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a formleſſe heap of Aſhes: So diſpoſing it, by excluding and deſtroying all particular formes, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the action of ſubſiſtent ones upon it. But my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking is, to convince that there is no impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity nor contradiction in nature, againſt this great and amazing Myſtery. If there were contradiction in it, it could not be true;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50630:45"/>
it were not the ſubject of a Miracle. But if I prove that there is no repugnance againſt the feaſibility of it, I am confident I ſhall not miſſe of hearty thanks from thoſe ſincere believers who have nothing to ſhake the firmneſſe of their Faith, but the ſuſpected impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Myſtery. Thus then. I ſhall begin with enquiring what it is that maketh a body continue ſtill the ſame. All bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes are compoſed of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and form. In ſaying of which I doe not mean that there are two diſtinct enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which being put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like meal and water
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50630:46"/>
doe concurre joyntly to compoſe a body, as they make bread. But they are notions which are ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a reall Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the object from whence they ariſe. In the object there is that, which correſpondeth adaequatly to the notions we frame of theſe two principles. We ſee that this which is now Coal, was larely wood, ſomewhat muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both theſe diſtinct ſubſtances; elſe, we muſt allow the firſt to have been anihilated by the change, and that nothing remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of it after the action of fire: And conſequently
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50630:46"/>
that the ſecond is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely created, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny praeexiſtent matter to ſerve for a Baſis to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. This obligeth us to have recourſe to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that is common to both theſe things. This that is thus common to both, is of it ſelf neither the one nor the other: But is that, which may be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one or the other. So that truly it is not this nor that nor any determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate thing: But it is a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to be this or that or any thing whatſoever. And this capacity, is called in the Schooles, Matter. Now that which filleth and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50630:47"/>
actuateth this capacity, and maketh it be a determinate thing, is that which they call the Form. So that the Form, is the compleating and perfecting of a body, and maketh it to be this or that, and fixeth it in the State of <hi>Being:</hi> whereas the matter abſtracted from the Form, hath no deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate being, no individua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is in effect and actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing; but hath, or rather is a capacity to be any thing. It muſt not then be on the ſide of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that we muſt look for the individuation and Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of our bodyes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Reſurrection. All
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50630:47"/>
mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is indifferent to every Form. There is no this or that in matter; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then as the Form en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſeth it to it ſelf; and thereby maketh it this or that. And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as long as the Form re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth the ſame, the thing is the ſame, and the matter is the ſame. Were it not for this, how could any body under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven remain the ſame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but for a ſhort Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſpace? All ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things are in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Flux. The contraſt of the Elements among themſelves, within every body; and other bodyes
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50630:48"/>
without it, working alſo perpetually upon it, are cauſes that out of every body there are continuall emanations, and that there are continuall ſupplyes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to it. Every thing is like a River that is in a perpetuall courſe. Which though we account it the ſame River to day as it was yeſterday; yet in truth there is not one drop of water in it to day that was in it yeſterday. But becauſe it is filled out of the ſame common Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine of (in it ſelf) undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed water which filled it yeſterday and a hundred yeares agone; and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50630:48"/>
that it is compriſed in the ſame Channell; It is ſtill eſteemed to be the ſame River. I remember to have ſeen in the King of <hi>Frances</hi> Garden at Saint <hi>Germain,</hi> very curious Grottos; whereof one was adorned with a caſt of water, ſo contrived, that as faſt as the water fell down into the reſerve or Baſin which was at the bottom of the Pipe that caſt it up with force a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty height, the water was ſtill conveyed up again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that caſting Pipe; and ſo made a kind of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall motion.

did uſe to put ſundry hollow inſtruments of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſhapes and Figures upon the mouth of the Pipe that did caſt up the water, ſo that the coarcted ſtream would ſpread it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad as ſoon as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments afforded it liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſometimes like a Bell, ſometimes like a Crown, otherwhiles like a Flower de Luce, and the like, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Form of the Inſtrument that compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and governed the courſe of the water. There were ſeverall Bells and ſeverall Crownes, with peculiar differences belonging to them; and ſo of the reſt

of the Machines. If now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had ſeen two or three differently appearing Bells, or Crownes; I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee again that Bell, or that Crown, which the Gardiner ſhewed we firſt, and he ſhould put on that Machine which he did put on the firſt time; ſhould I not have reaſon to ſay it were the ſame Bell or Crown I ſaw firſt? The water that furniſheth mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to all theſe varieties and games, is ſtill the ſame. As long as it is in its great bulk, there is no this or that part of it: all of it is one Maſſe, that hath no this or that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed

any where in it. But if you take never ſo few drops of it in a particular veſſel, that divideth it from the reſt; then, there is this glaſs-full (for example) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the reſt of the common Magazine. And ſo, whiles the firſt Engine or Pipe to repreſent a Bell, is put on a ſecond time; it denominateth truly that Bell to be the ſame that it was at firſt; and while it is in continuall fl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

that my eyes, my ears, my whole body, now after near 60. years durance in nature, are the ſame, the very ſame, they were, when I lay a weak Embryon in my Mothers womb. The continual floud of tranſpiration, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſupply of augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do nothing hinder the Identity of this body of mine, as long as the Form which maketh it to be what it is, remaineth ſtill the ſame.

her to have the ſame body ſhe had in this World, if ſhe be built up again to a whole Man, out of the generall Magazine of matter which furniſhed her with a body before; and which hath no this or that belonging to her, otherwiſe then as ſome form engroſſing her maketh her to be this or that body?
