            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>MAdam, it is but just, since you receive</l>
               <l>All the Delights our Soveraign can give,</l>
               <l>That we; in gratitude unto our King,</l>
               <l>Shou'd to your Highness bring an Offering.</l>
               <l>For we by Duty are oblig'd to Prize</l>
               <l>Those that are Gracious in our Princes Eyes,</l>
               <l>As well as hate his greatest Enemies.</l>
               <l>Accept this also, Madam, sent to you,</l>
               <l>Both as Your Merit, and Your Beauties due;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:48867:4"/>Which to You not the least of Glory brings,</l>
               <l>Having by it subdu'd the best of Kings.</l>
               <l>And now Your Country may Precedence claim,</l>
               <l>Since You have gave it such a lasting Fame;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Greece, Helen; England, Rosamond</hi> did boast,</l>
               <l>But <hi>France</hi> You henceforth will Glory most;</l>
               <l>For by Your conqu'ring Eyes You have made known</l>
               <l>The Monarchy of Beauty is Your own.</l>
               <l>You are the Darling of my King, His Pleasure,</l>
               <l>His <hi>Indies</hi> of incomparable Treasure;</l>
               <l>That precious Gem, who from your Country came,</l>
               <l>Too narrow for the Limits of Your Fame,</l>
               <l>Into the Bosom of a King who knows</l>
               <l>What 'tis for to deserve, and to dispose.</l>
               <l>But stay, my Muse, no Sacrilegious Eye</l>
               <l>Shou'd dare be so Prophane, as once to pry</l>
               <l>In Princes Actions; they like Gods appear,</l>
               <l>And never move in any common Sphere:</l>
               <l>We shou'd from their Concerns our selves retire,</l>
               <l>And what we understand not well, admire.</l>
               <l>Your Pardon, Madam, if my zealous Passion</l>
               <l>Has err'd beyond the Rules of Dedication;</l>
               <l>And if so high and rare a Contemplation</l>
               <l>Shou'd fly beyond all bounds of Limitation,</l>
               <l>And on <hi>Dedalian</hi> Wings shou'd dare to pry</l>

               <l>Since my Ambition for your Service may</l>
               <l>Make me speak more than others dare to say.</l>
               <l>Then prostrate at your Feet I now lay down</l>
               <l>This Infant Book, which may deserve your Frown;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:48867:4"/>But hopes a better Fate, since the intent</l>
               <l>Was good, and only for your Service meant.</l>
               <l>Which if you view but with a pleasing Eye,</l>
               <l>It will presage such a Felicity,</l>

            <p>TILL this minute I was in doubt whether or no I should afford you an Epistle, being as indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent whether you take the pains to read it, as you are to go to the cost to buy my Book. It was design'd for my own Pleasure, (being the rellicts of some Idle hours) wherein though I have borrowed the name of <hi>Clelia,</hi> I wou'd not have you think I do it as your <hi>Epigram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi> do, only to sill up my Verse, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke an unknown Deity; but that I veil'd my Ambition under it, not daring to name a Person whose Quallity and Merit did so far exceed all my pretentions, that it had been a sin as great as my Ambition, to have once but mentioned her name, and


<pb facs="tcp:48867:5"/>
to have expos'd it to the publick view. And as for what else you find contain'd in this slender Vollumn, if you think it worth your time to give it the perusal, you will find I took more care to please my self, than you.</p>

               <head>A Dream.</head>
               <l>TEll me, thou pale-fac'd Empress of the Night,</l>
               <l>What horrid terror did my mind affright.</l>
               <l>I saw, and in a Dream a Damsel stood</l>
               <l>Before me trembling, all besmear'd with Blood.</l>
               <l>In her right Hand a wither'd Branch she had,</l>
               <l>And with a sable Veil her Brows were clad;</l>
               <l>And to her self she mourning seem'd to say,</l>
               <l>'Twas love, alas! fond Girl, did thee betray.</l>
               <l>And so she vanish'd. Then I heard a cry.</l>
               <l>Of a lost Damsel, at the point to die.</l>
               <l>Her latest Breath did on <hi>Narcissus</hi> call,</l>
               <l>Cruel <hi>Narcissus,</hi> cruel in my fall.</l>
               <l>For thee I did honour and life forsake,</l>
               <l>And gave thee Love, which thou refus'd to take;</l>
               <l>For thee I did <hi>Philanders</hi> Love despise,</l>
               <l>Who now may glory at my injuries.</l>
               <l>Her other words she did in Tears confound,</l>
               <l>Abruptly mangled in a dying sound.</l>
               <l>With that I shrunk, and sudain terror prest</l>
               <l>My melting Heart in my molested Breast;</l>
               <l>I ponder'd in my mind, at length I knew</l>
               <l>The voice was <hi>Phillis,</hi> that her self had slew;</l>

                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:48867:28"/>And art thou dead, said I, false unto me?</l>
               <l>His hate's a just reward of Perjury.</l>
               <l>But O that yet my life cou'd thine redeem,</l>
               <l>My Soul shou'd vanish as of no esteem:</l>
               <l>O cruelty! what made thee so unkind,</l>
               <l>To kill the Joy, and Darling of Mankind?</l>
               <l>And since thy Death by Pen can't be exprest,</l>
               <l>I'le write thy Elegie upon my Breast.</l>
               <l>But snatching at my Sword, a Hand was sent,</l>
               <l>My suden Execution to prevent;</l>
               <l>And <hi>Phillis,</hi> who before I thought was dead,</l>
               <l>Appear'd, and with a Garland Crown'd my Head,</l>
               <l>And told me death had not the power to sever</l>
               <l>Two Hands, two Hearts, that must be joyn'd for ever.</l>
               <l>Then waking suddenly, I knew the Theam</l>
               <l>Was my molested fancy in a Dream.</l>
               <l>Even when I wake or sleep thou'rt in my mind,</l>

               <l>I laid me down upon the Grass to rest,</l>

               <l>Millions of thoughts I interweav'd with fears,</l>

               <l>Ah, cruel Nymph, said I, what God unkind</l>
               <l>Hath with such Cruelty incens'd thy mind?</l>
               <l>Lay by <hi>Ioves</hi> Flames, <hi>Salmonean</hi> terrors fear,</l>
               <l>Least you his Thunder and his Lightning bear.</l>

               <l>Can ne're be pleas'd with acts of cruelty.</l>
               <l>But if you needs will take a Goddess form,</l>
               <l>Which can your native Beauty nought adorn,</l>

               <l>Thus whilst my mind passion toss'd too and fro,</l>
               <l>As Waves by Winds which on the Ocean blow,</l>

               <l>Shall put on all her Ornaments and Geer,</l>

               </head>
               <l>HArk how the roaring Winds, (great God of Thunder,)</l>
               <l>Exalt the briny Floods, to tear a sunder</l>
               <l>Our well rig'd Vessel riding on the Main,</l>
               <l>Whose lofty threatned Pendant does disdain</l>
               <l>Proud <hi>Neptunes</hi> angry Power, and awful wrath,</l>
               <l>Dashing the boldest of his Waves to Froth.</l>
               <l>Which when the King of Floods with anger saw,</l>
               <l>His awful Trident scorning to withdraw,</l>
               <l>He summon'd all the Waves, and did implore</l>
               <l>The <hi>Eolean</hi> aid, which made the Winds to roar.</l>
               <l>Now like to Mountains rise the Waves on high,</l>
               <l>Tossing the nimble Vessel to the Skie;</l>
               <l>Then by a great descent she falls again</l>
               <l>Into the gaping Bowels of the Main.</l>

               <l>The skilful Pilot knows not how to steer.</l>
               <l>The Ocean boils, and, to augment the rage,</l>
               <l>The Winds from ev'ry Point the Floods engage.</l>
               <l>Heavens face is cover'd with a Veil of Night,</l>
               <l>The Thunder bearing Clouds ejected Light</l>

               <l>Presents to all an unavoided Fate.</l>
               <l>Which when the Captain saw, he gaz'd a while,</l>

               <l>And with more Pow'r than <hi>Neptune,</hi> which doth sway</l>
               <l>His wat'ry Trident, which the Waves obey,</l>
               <l>His loud Imperial voice commands a peace,</l>
               <l>Whose Eccho stops the Waves, and makes them cease.</l>
               <l>Or like fierce <hi>Mars,</hi> with an undaunted minde,</l>
               <l>As if their God the wat'ry Realm did bind,</l>
               <l>He cuts the smiling Ocean, and does stand</l>

               <l>Telling, some mighty God usurp'd his Seat,</l>
               <l>And all the Waves lay prostrate at his Feet.</l>
               <l>The Sea-green God all in a rage appears,</l>
               <l>And the shrill <hi>Trytons</hi> Visage anger bears;</l>
               <l>The Mermaids skip and dance about the Boat,</l>
               <l>Which Seamen say does dreadful Storms denote,</l>

               <l>Dashing their briny Floods against the Skies.</l>
               <l>The Captain strives in vain the Ship to save,</l>
               <l>While on each side appears a threatning Grave.</l>
               <l>There's no cessation, VVaves the VVaves out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies,</l>
               <l>And threaten Heaven with their batteries.</l>
               <l>VVhat shou'd they do, poor men? their Courage fails,</l>
               <l>And all their hopes are shatter'd as their Sails.</l>

               <l>The Captain then, with a Couragious motion,</l>
               <l>'Leaps in the raging Bowels of the Ocean,</l>
               <l>And with his threatning Sword he cuts the Waves,</l>
               <l>The raging Floods with Valour he outbraves;</l>
               <l>And swimming to the Shoar, his Sword he shakes,</l>
               <l>Whereat the roaring Sea retires and quakes.</l>
               <l>But all his men, alas! like silly Sheep,</l>
               <l>Sink to the bottom of the swelling Deep.</l>
