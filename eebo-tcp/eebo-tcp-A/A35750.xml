         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Me from permitting this even to
have seen the light; for meer Versions do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
carry with them this Property, that if
not well done they may much disgrace, but if
well, not much commend the doers.</p>
            <p>And certainly I might well have expected
the same chance, had this been the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of an History, Play or Romance; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there is requisi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but a conformation of Idiom and language,
manner and customary expression; But the
<pb facs="tcp:99518:3"/>
nature of this present Work will not admit
of the like liberty, and therefore, I hope, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Iudicious Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ders it may be exempt
from the common Fate of Translations; for
if we look upon it as a Philosophical or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sical
Tract, or rather as (really it is) a
Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sico-Mathematical Argumentation, we
shall find that a great strictness of Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is requisite to be observed therein. Sothat
had a Translator taken upon him to use his
own liberty of Phrase, he would thereby have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger'd
the sense and force of the Arguments;
for P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>liteness of language might as well be
expected in a Translation of <hi>Euclide</hi> as in
this. And all that are acquainted with this
famous Authors design, do very well know,
that it was his intention in these Meditations
<hi>Mathematically to demonstrate,</hi> that there
is a <hi>God,</hi> and that mans <hi>mind</hi> is <hi>incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real.</hi>
And it was his opinion, that metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks
may as clearly be demonstrated as mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
as witness his expression in the Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory
Epistle of this Work to the <hi>Sorbone</hi>
Doctors, <hi>Eas</hi> (Rationes scilicet) <hi>quibus

That he reputed his Arguments used
in these Meditations, to equal if not excell
<pb facs="tcp:99518:3"/>
Geometrical certainty.</p>
            <p>And this, I suppose, is sufficient to make the
Reader, not expect herein any smoothness of
phrase or quaint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ess of Expression; what is
here delivered in English is immediately ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
as it is naturally in the Original. The
words, we hope, may be apposite enough, and
fit to express what is here designed, and I
think it a derogation from the Authors skill to
draw the Picture of his mind in any other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
than what his own Copy expresses.</p>
            <p>Thus far in vindication of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
plain stile and rough Language of the
following Translation. I shall add a line or
two, first relating to the Readers, secondly of
the Author, and lastly of the Meditations
themselves, together with the Motives which
excited me to this Work.</p>
            <p>As to the Readers, 'tis, I suppose, so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that candcur of mind, and fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>edome
from prejudice is requisite to all that desire to
advantage themselves by reading other mens
notions, that it need not be here insisted on
with much earnestness; yet considering the
Antiquity of this subject, and the novelty of
the Arguments here produced, it seems to be
more than ordinarily requisite for an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rusal of the ensuing Tract. Neither are
<pb facs="tcp:99518:4"/>
the following Meditations to be slightly pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
over, but with diligence and attention to
be read; for as in mathematical demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the careless missing of any one single Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may render the Conclusion obscure and
sometimes inconsequent, so in these metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Demonstrations, which (as before has been
noted from the illustrious Author thereof) for
certainty do equal, if not excel Geometrical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
the slight attention to any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Argument may frustrate the design of the
whole discourse.</p>
            <p>The Reasoning therefore here being close
and solid, and (as in Mathematicks) the
knowledge of the latter depending on the
knowledge of what went before, 'tis the duty of
every Reader seriously to attend the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
as also the connexion of the whole. Let
him weigh the Arguments and perpend the
Conclusions, and after a clear and distinct
Kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wledge, lett him pass his judgement.</p>
            <p>And to this end I shall make it my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
to every Reader, that he would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with a single perusual of the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
but that he would often repeat his
reading t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>em over; for by this means the force
of those Arguments, which at first may by
chance escape the most diligent and attentive
<pb facs="tcp:99518:4"/>
Peruser, by a second or third Essay may offer
themselves more fully to his Consideration.
This Was the desire of our Author in an other
of his peices, I mean his <hi>Principles of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,</hi>
which I am sure do not require so
strict an attention of mind, as these ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
specualtions; and therefore if it
were his Request in that case, we may Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k that'twas no less his desire in this.</p>
            <p>When we come to speak of the Incomparable
Author of these Meditations, we have reason
to lament our own Ignorance, and to blame th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Ingratitude of the Age wherein he lived, for
not transmitting to Posterity more certain and
ample Records of the Life and Conversation
of this Excellent Philosopher, all that has
been Written in this kind gives us only so
much light into the Life of this Prodigious
Man, as may make us wish for more; impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which, I shall recommend the Readers to a
further enquiry into the inward Thoughts, (larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discover'd in the Writings) of our Famous
Author, of whose outward actions and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
we have so small knowledge.</p>

of the Peripatetick Philosophy; He used
therefore his utmost endeavours (as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
testifies in his <hi>Dissertatio de Methodo)</hi>
to get loose from those Chains and Fetters of
Mind, to which the weakness of his tender
years had subjected him.</p>
            <p>To this end he betook himself to a long
course of Travel, that by the variety of Objects,
which he was likely to meet with in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
<pb facs="tcp:99518:5"/>
the memory of his past Notions might
be blotted out; In his travel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
much to the study of the Art Military,
and Mathematicks; In the latter he has left
the World large testimonies of his Exeellence
in his <hi>Book of Geometry;</hi> and in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
we have reason to believe him most expert,
for He was personally present at some Sieges
and Battles both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> as
particularly at the Siege of <hi>Rochel,</hi> of <hi>Gava</hi>
near <hi>Genoa,</hi> of <hi>Breda,</hi> at the Battle of
<hi>Prague, &amp;c.</hi> so that we may conclude that he
had a Genius fitted (according to the Motto
of the noble <hi>Sir W. Raliegh) Tam Marti,
quam Mercurio,</hi> For the Pike as well as Pen.
And as the Glorious Roman Emperour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came

French King upon very Honourableterms to
<hi>Paris;</hi> During his Continuance there he so
order'd his annual Revenue, that he might be
supplied by the hands of a Friend wherever he
was. He staid at <hi>Paris</hi> three years, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
Himself to a solitary village in <hi>Holland</hi>
called <hi>Egmond,</hi> where he lived twenty five
years, during which time he apply'd himself
wholly to the Restauration of true Philosophy,
wherein he gave the World such mighty testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of his Excellence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in a short time
he became celebrated in the mouths of all
Learned Men. Neither were the Courts of
Princes silent in his deserved Praises; for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a Retirement of twenty five years he was
Invited by <hi>Christina Queen of Sweedland</hi> to
her Court; Thither upon the intreaty of this
brave and Learned Princess he betook himself,
where he had not continued Long before he
was struck with a Peripneumonia or Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Lungs (contracted, as it is
thought by the long Discourses which he used
to hold bare headed with the Queen, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them sometimes till far in the Night,)
of which unhappy distemper he Died the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Day after he sicken'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99518:6"/>Thus Expired this Wonder of his Own and
succeeding Ages, desired and lamented by all
men, Aequal'd by none. He was buried in a
costly Monument consisting of four sides, upon
which were inscribed Epitaphs; bestow'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him by many Renown'd Persons.</p>

               </gap> for the untimely Decease of this
Worthy Philosopher? But Especially what
shall we now do to recover our Loss? Let us
endeavour to Redeem what we have lost by
well Husbanding and careful improvement of
what is left; which may be done in Part by a
Diligent Perusal of the Works written by this
Excellent Author; This, This only is the way of
Reviving him again, and of giving him Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
in spight of his untimely Fate. And
so let him for ever live celebrated by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
Praises of all ingenious Enquirers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

            <p>Let us therefore cast our eye upon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Work of this extroardinary Philosopher,
and therein let us admire his profound Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>In fine, such is the Excellence of these six
Meditations, that I cannot resemble his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

herein better than to the Six Days
Work of the Supream Architect; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
next to the Creation of All things out

                  </gap>s</hi>
does hereby deserve as it were the name
of a Creatour. In the first Meditation we are
Presented with a Rude and Indigested Choas
of Errours and Doubts, till the Divine spirit
of the Noble <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> (Pardon the Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Expression) <hi>moves upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused

some <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>distinct Light;</hi> by which
<hi>Sun-shine</hi> he proceeds to bring forth and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
other <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Truth;</hi> Till at last by
a six Days Labour he Establishes this Fair
Fabrick (as I may call it) of the <hi>Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
World</hi> on foundations that shall never be
shaken. Then sitting downwith rest and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb facs="tcp:99518:7"/>
he looks upon this his Off-spring,
and Pronounces it <hi>Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Things Consider'd, I need not make
any long Apologies for my undertaking a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
thereof; The excellency of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
is sufficient to vindicate my endeavours
to present the English World with a Copy, and
he that sha'l blame my Intentions of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
the Methods of Truth to those
that have only the English Tongue, may as well
find fault with those English that propagate
the Christian Religion among savage Indians,
and translate the Scriptures into their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
because they have not the English Tongue.
To understand Latin is no (or at most a very
small) part of Learning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
every Cobler in <hi>Rome</hi> was once endow'd
with; and therefore must there then be no
translations out of <hi>Greek</hi> into Latin? I doubt
not, but there are many Persons in our Nations,
who tho wanting Latin, are notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very capable of the most abstracted spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations;
the late disturbances of our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
occasion'd many Youths, who were then
in a fair way of Instruction, to forsake their
learning, and divert their intentions from
Literature to Arms, and yet many of these
have afterwards become Men of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb facs="tcp:99518:8"/>
abilities and qualifications for learning
notwithstanding their deficiency in the Roman
Tongue. And I see no Reason why it should
not be the desire, and consequently the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
of every true English man, to make
his language as universal as is now the <hi>French,</hi>
into which the best Books in all sorts of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
both Poetry and Prose, are daily tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
out of all languages, but especially out
of Greek and Latine. Among which these
Meditations are to be found, entituled, <hi>Les
Meditations Metaphysiques De Rene Des
Cartes touchant la Premiere Philosophie,</hi>
This was translated out of the Authors Latine
into French by <hi>Monsieur le D. D. L. N. S.</hi>
The several Objections also, which were made
by divers learned Persons against these Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
with the Authors Answers, were tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
into French by M. B. L. R. And, I
hope, no one will assert, that the French are
more fit to receive those metaphysical Notions
delivered herein than the English Nation.</p>
            <p>But 'twas none of the smallest motives I
had to this undertaking, that tho some fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
English Authours have taken notice of
the Arguments here produced (for the proof
of a <hi>Deity</hi> drawn from the <hi>Idea</hi> we have of
<hi>God</hi> in our Mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Particularly the
<pb facs="tcp:99518:8"/>
most excellent and learned <hi>Dr. Stillingfleet</hi>
in the first Chapter of the third Book in his
<hi>Origines Sacrae,</hi> who refers his Readers to
a further search into these Meditations in the
400 <hi>page</hi> of that Discourse; as also the
Reverend Dr. <hi>Henry More</hi> in his <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote
against Atheism,</hi> and more fully in his
<hi>Appendix</hi> annex'd thereto, hath treated of
our Authors demonstration; and yet nothing
of the genuine original from whence they have
borrowed all their Copies (tho some of them
drawn in a larger size, yet I question whether
so expressive) nothing of our Authors proper
management hath ever appear'd in English.
Those that assert these Arguments to have
been long before thought upon by some of the
Fathers, I shall refer to our Authors just vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of himself in his several Answers to
Objections made against these Discourses.</p>
            <p>And here I shall dismiss the Reader detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>SOME years past I perceived how
MANY <hi>Falsities</hi> I admitted off as
<hi>Truths</hi> in my Younger years, and
how <hi>Dubious</hi> those things were
which I raised from thence; and
therefore I thought it requisite (if I had
a designe to establish any thing that
should prove <hi>firme</hi> and <hi>permanent</hi> in sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences)
that once in my life I should clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cast aside all my former opinions, and
begin a new from some <hi>First principles.</hi>
But this seemed a great Task, and I still
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99518:10"/>
expected that maturity of years, then
which none could be more apt to receive
Learning; upon which account I waited
so long, that at last I should deservedly
be blamed had I spent that time in <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration</hi>
which remain'd only for <hi>Action.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This day therefore I conveniently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased
my mind from all cares, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
to my self a Time Quiet, and free
from all Business, I retired my self Alone;
and now at length will I freely and
serioulsy apply my self to the General over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of all my former Opinions.</p>
               <p>To the Accomplishment of Which, it
will not be necessary for me to prove
them all <hi>false</hi> (for that perhaps I shall
never atcheive) But because my reason
perswades me, that I must withdraw my
assent no less from those opinions which
seem <hi>not so very certain</hi> and <hi>undoubted,</hi>
then I should from those that are <hi>Apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
false,</hi> it will be sufficient if I reject all
those wherein I find any <hi>Occasion</hi> of
doubt.</p>
               <p>Neither to effect this is it necessary,
that they all should be run over particul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
(which would be an endles trouble)
but because the <hi>Foundation</hi> being once
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99518:10"/>
undermin'd, whether is built ther on
will of its own accord come to the
ground, I shall therefore immediately as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
the vey <hi>principle,</hi> on which whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
I have believed was <hi>grounded.</hi> Viz.</p>
               <p>Whatever I have hitherto admitted as most
true, that I received either from, or by my
Senses; but these I have often found to deceive
me, and 'tis prudence never certainly to
trust those that have (tho but once) deceived
us.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Doubt.</hi> But tho sometimes the <hi>senses</hi>
deceive us being exercised about <hi>remote</hi>
or <hi>small</hi> objects, y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t there are many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things of which we cannot doubt
tho we know them only by the senses?
as that at present I am in this place, that
I am sitting by a fire, that I have a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
gown on me, that I feel this Paper
with my hands; But how can it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
that these hands or this body is mine;
Unless I should compare my self to those
mad men, whose brains are disturbed by
such a disorderly melancholick vapour,
that makes them continually profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be Kings, tho they are very poor,
or fancy themselves cloathed in Purple
Robes, tho they are naked, or that their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99518:11"/>
heads are made of Clay as a bottle, or of
glass, &amp;c. But these are mad men, and I
should be as mad as they in following
their example by fancying these things as
they do.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Solution.</hi> This truly would seem ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
clear to those that never <hi>sleep,</hi> and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the same things (and sometimes more
unlikely) in their repose, then these mad
men do whilst they are awake; for how
often am I perswaded in a Dream of these
usual occurrences, that I am in this place,
that I have a Gown on me, that I am sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
by a fire, &amp;c. Tho all the while I am
lying naked between the Sheets.</p>
               <p>But now I am certain that I am awake
and look upon this Paper, neither is this
head which I shake asleep, I knowingly
and willingly stretch out this hand, and
am sensible that things so distinct could
not happen to one that sleeps. As if I
could not remember my self to have been
deceived formerly in my sleep by the like
thoughts; which while I consider more
attentively <hi>I</hi> am so far convinced of the
difficulty of distinguishing sleep from wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that <hi>I</hi> am amazed, and this very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement
almost perswades me that <hi>I</hi> am

selves <hi>asleep,</hi> and that these things are not
<hi>true,</hi> viz. that we open our eyes, move our
heads, stretch our hands, and perhaps that
we have no such things as hands or a body.
Yet we must confess, that what we see in
a Dream is (as it were) <hi>a painted Picture,</hi>
which cannot be devised but after the
<hi>likeness</hi> of some <hi>real</hi> things; and that
therefore these Generals at least, <hi>viz.</hi> eyes,
head, hands, and the whole body are
things <hi>really existent</hi> and not <hi>imaginary;</hi>
For Painters themselves, (even then when
they design Mermaids and Satyrs in the
most unusual shapes) do not give them
natures altogether new, but only add the
divers Parts of different Animals toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
And if by chance they invent any
thing so new that nothing was ever seen
like it, so that 'tis wholy fictitious and
false, yet the colours at least of which,
they make it must be <hi>true Colours;</hi> soupon
the same account, tho these General things
as eyes, head, hands, &amp;c. may be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary;
yet nevertheless we must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
confess the more <hi>simple</hi> and <hi>universal</hi>
things to be <hi>True,</hi> of which (as of true
Colours) these <hi>Images</hi> of things (whether

               <p>To which Arguments <hi>I</hi> know not

that there is nothing of all those things
which <hi>I</hi> formerly received as <hi>Truths,</hi>
whereof at present <hi>I</hi> may not <hi>doubt;</hi>
and this doubt shall not be grounded on

<hi>I</hi> must hereafter (if <hi>I</hi> designe to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover

               <p>But 'tis not sufficient to think only

Parts, nor a <hi>Wind,</hi> nor <hi>Fire,</hi> nor <hi>Vapour,</hi>
nor <hi>Breath,</hi> nor whatever I my self can
feign, for all these things I have supposed
<hi>not to Be.</hi> Yet my Position stands firm,
<hi>Neverthless I am something.</hi> Yet perhaps
it so falls out that these very things which
I suppose not to exist (because to me <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known</hi>)
are in reality nothing <hi>different</hi>
from that very <hi>Self,</hi> which I <hi>know.</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell, I dispute it not now, I can only
give my opinion of those things whereof
I have knowledge. I am sure that
I exist, I ask who I am whom I thus know,
certainly, the knowledge, of <hi>Me</hi>
(precisely taken) depends not on those

to think upon the <hi>shape</hi> or <hi>image</hi> of a <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal</hi>

that <hi>I am,</hi> and I know also that 'tis possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that all these <hi>images,</hi> and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Which things Consider'd I should be no

may more throughly understand what I am,</hi>
then if should say, <hi>at Present I am awake
and perceive something true, but because it
appears not evidently enough, I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to sleep, that in a Dream I may perceive
it more evidently and truely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore I know that nothing that I
can comprehend by my <hi>imagination,</hi> can
belong to the <hi>Nation</hi> I have of <hi>my self,</hi>
and that I must carefully withdraw my
mind from those things it that may more
<hi>distinctly</hi> perceive its <hi>own Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let me ask therefore <hi>What I am, A

is a thing, <hi>doubting, understanding, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
denying, willing, hilling, imagining</hi> also,
and <hi>sensitive.</hi> These truely are not a few
<hi>Properties,</hi> if they all belong to Me. And
Why should they Not belong to me? For
am not I the very same who at present <hi>doubt</hi>
almost of All things; yet <hi>understand</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
which thing onely I <hi>affirm</hi> to be
true, I <hi>deny</hi> all other things, I am <hi>willing</hi>
to know more, <hi>I would not</hi> be deceived, I
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99518:18"/>
                  <hi>imagine</hi> many things <hi>unwillingly,</hi> and <hi>consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
many things as coming to me by my
<hi>senses.</hi> Which of all these faculties is it,
which is not as <hi>true</hi> as that I <hi>Exist,</hi> tho <hi>I</hi>
should <hi>sleep,</hi> or my <hi>Creatour</hi> should as
much as in him lay, strive to <hi>deceive</hi> Me?
which of them is it that is <hi>distinct</hi> from my
<hi>thought?</hi> which of them is it that can be
<hi>seperated</hi> from <hi>me?</hi> For that I am the same
that <hi>doubt, understand,</hi> and <hi>will</hi> is so <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi>
that I know not how to explain it
more <hi>manifestly,</hi> and that I also am the
same that <hi>imagine,</hi> for tho perhaps (as I
have supposed) no thing that can be <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined</hi>
is <hi>true,</hi> yet the <hi>imaginative Power</hi> it
self is <hi>really</hi> existent, and makes up a part
of my <hi>Thought;</hi> and last of all that I am
the same that am <hi>sensitive,</hi> or <hi>perceive cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal</hi>
things as by my <hi>sense,</hi> yet that I now
<hi>see</hi> light, <hi>hear</hi> a noise, <hi>feel</hi> heat, these things
are false, for I suppose my self <hi>asleep,</hi> but
I <hi>know</hi> that I <hi>see, hear,</hi> and am <hi>heated,</hi> that
cannot be <hi>false;</hi> and this it is that in me
is <hi>properly</hi> called <hi>Sense,</hi> and this strictly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
is the same with <hi>thought.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By these Considerations I begin a little
better to <hi>understand My self</hi> what I am;
But yet it <hi>seems,</hi> and I cannot but <hi>think</hi> that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99518:19"/>
                  <hi>Corporeal Things</hi> (whose <hi>Images</hi> are formed
in my <hi>thought,</hi> and which by my <hi>sense,</hi> I
perceive) are much more <hi>distinctly known,</hi>
then that <hi>confused Notion</hi> of <hi>My Self</hi> which
<hi>imagination</hi> cannot afford me. And yet
'tis strange that things <hi>doubtf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l, unknown,
distinct from Me,</hi> should be <hi>apprehended</hi>
more <hi>clearly</hi> by <hi>Me,</hi> then a Thing that is
<hi>True,</hi> then a thing that is <hi>known,</hi> or then <hi>I
myself;</hi> But the Reason is, that my Mind
loves to wander, and suffer not it self to
be bounded within the first limits of
<hi>Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let it therefore Wander, and once
more let me give it the Free Reins, that

may suffer it self to be more easily Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd.</p>
               <p>Let me consider those things, which of
all Things I formerly conceived most <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,</hi>
that is to say, <hi>Bodies</hi> which we
touch, which we see, not bodies in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
(for those <hi>General</hi> Conceptions are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually

                     </gap>d</hi>) but some one <hi>Body</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>Let us chuse for example this piece of
<hi>Bees-wax,</hi> it was lately taken from the
<hi>Comb,</hi> it has not yet lost all the <hi>tast</hi> of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99518:19"/>
the <hi>Honey,</hi> it retains something of the
<hi>smell</hi> of the <hi>Flowers</hi> from whence 'twas
gather'd, its <hi>colour, shape,</hi> and <hi>bigness</hi> are
manifest, 'tis <hi>hard,</hi> 'tis <hi>cold,</hi> 'tis <hi>easily felt,</hi>
and if you will knock it with your sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
'twill <hi>make a noise:</hi> In fine, it hath all
things requisite to the most perfect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a <hi>Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But behold whilst I am speaking 'tis
put to the Fire, its <hi>tast</hi> is purged away,
the <hi>smell</hi> is vanish'd, the <hi>colour</hi> is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
the <hi>shape</hi> is alter'd, its <hi>bulk</hi> is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
its become <hi>soft,</hi> 'tis <hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ot,</hi> it can scarce
be <hi>felt,</hi> and now (though you strike it)
it makes not <hi>noise.</hi> Does it yet continue
the same Wax? surely it does, this all
confess, no one denies it, no one doubts
it. What therefore was there in it that
was so evidently known? surely none of
those things which I <hi>perceived</hi> by my <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;</hi>
for what I <hi>smelt, tasted,</hi> have <hi>seen,
felt,</hi> or <hi>heard,</hi> are all <hi>vanish'd,</hi> and yet the
<hi>Wax remains.</hi> Perhaps 'twas this only
that I now think on, <hi>viz,</hi> that the <hi>Wax</hi>
it self was not that <hi>tast of Honey,</hi> that
<hi>smell of Flowers,</hi> that <hi>whiteness,</hi> that
<hi>shape,</hi> or that <hi>sound,</hi> but it was a <hi>Body</hi>
which awhile before appear'd to me <hi>so</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:99518:20"/>
and <hi>so modified,</hi> but now <hi>otherwise.</hi> But
what is it strictly that I thus imagine?
let me consider: And having rejected
whatever belongs not to the Wax, let me
see what will; remain, <hi>viz.</hi> this only, a
<hi>thing extended, flexible,</hi> and <hi>mutable.</hi> But
what is this <hi>flexible,</hi> and <hi>mutable?</hi> is it
that I <hi>imagine</hi> that this Wax from being
<hi>round</hi> may be made <hi>square,</hi> or from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>square</hi> can be made <hi>triangular?</hi> No,
this is not it; for I conceive it capable
of <hi>innumerable</hi> such <hi>changes,</hi> and yet I
canot by my <hi>imagination</hi> run over these
<hi>Innumerables;</hi> Wherefore this notion of
its <hi>mutability</hi> proceeds not from my <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</hi>
What then is <hi>extended?</hi> is not
its <hi>Extension</hi> also <hi>unknown?</hi> For when it
<hi>melts</hi> 'tis <hi>greater,</hi> when it <hi>boils</hi> 'tis <hi>greater,</hi>
and yet <hi>greater</hi> when the heat is increas'd;
and I should not rightly judge of the
Wax, did I not think it capable of more
various <hi>Extensions</hi> than I can <hi>imagine.</hi> It
remains therefore for me only to confess,
that I cannot <hi>imagine</hi> what this Wax is,
but that I <hi>perceive</hi> with my <hi>Mind</hi> what it
is. I speak of this <hi>particular</hi> Wax, for of
Wax in <hi>general</hi> the <hi>notion</hi> is more <hi>dear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what Wax is this that I only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99518:20"/>
by my mind? 'Tis the same which
I see, which I touch, which I imagine, and
in fine, the same which at first I judged
it to be. but this is to be noted, that the
<hi>perception</hi> thereof is not the <hi>sight,</hi> the
<hi>touch,</hi> or the <hi>imagination</hi> thereof; neither
was it ever so, though at first it seem'd so.
But the <hi>perception</hi> thereof is the <hi>inspection</hi>
or <hi>beholding</hi> of the Mind only, which may
be either <hi>imperfect</hi> and <hi>confused,</hi> as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
it was; or <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>distinct,</hi> as
now it is; the <hi>more</hi> or the <hi>less</hi> I consider
the Composition of the Wax.</p>
               <p>In the interim, I cannot but admire
how prone my mind is to erre; for
though I revolve these things with my
self <hi>silently,</hi> and <hi>without speaking,</hi> yet am
I intangled in <hi>meer words,</hi> and am almsot
deceived by the usual way of <hi>expression;</hi>
for we commonly say, <hi>that we see the Wax
it self if it be present,</hi> and not, <hi>that we
judge it present by its colour or shape;</hi> from
whence I should immediately thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
therefore the Wax is known by
the <hi>sight</hi> of the <hi>eye,</hi> and not by the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection</hi>
of the <hi>mind</hi> only. Thus I should
have concluded, had not I by chance
look'd out of my window, and seen men
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99518:21"/>
Passing by in the Street; which men I as
usually say that I <hi>see,</hi> as I do now, that
I <hi>see</hi> this Wax; and yet I see nothing
but their Hair and Garments, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
may cover only <hi>artifical Machines</hi>
and <hi>movements,</hi> but I judge them to be
men; so that what I though I only <hi>saw</hi>
with my eyes, I comprehend by my <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicative
Faculty,</hi> which is <hi>my Soul,</hi> But it
becomes not one, who desires to be wiser
than the Vulgar, to draw matter of <hi>doubt</hi>
from those ways of <hi>expression,</hi> which the
Vulgar have invented.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let us proceed and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
whether I perceived more <hi>perfectly</hi>
and <hi>evidently</hi> what the Wax was, when I
first look'd on't, and believed that I
knew it by my outward <hi>senses,</hi> or at least
by my <hi>common sense</hi> (as they call it) that
is to say, <hi>by my imagination;</hi> or whether
at pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt I <hi>better understand</hi> it, after I
have more diligently enquired both <hi>what
it is,</hi> and how it may be <hi>known.</hi> Surely
it would be a foolish thing to make it
matter of doubt to know which of these
parts are true; What was there in my
first <hi>perception</hi> that was <hi>distinct?</hi> What
was there that seem'd not incident to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99518:21"/>
other Animal? But now when I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
the Wax from its outward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents,
and consider it as if it were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
with it's coverings pull'd off, then
I cannot but really perceive it with my
mind, though yet perhaps my judgment
may erre.</p>
               <p>But what shall I now say as to my
<hi>mind,</hi> or my <hi>self?</hi> (for as yet I admit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
as belonging to me but a <hi>mind.</hi>)
Why (shall I say?) should not I, who
seem to perceive this Wax so <hi>distinctly,</hi>
know my <hi>self</hi> not only more <hi>truly</hi> and
more <hi>certainly,</hi> but more <hi>distinctly</hi> and <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently?</hi>
For if I judge that <hi>this Wax ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists,</hi>
because I <hi>see</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Wax; surely it
will be much more <hi>evident,</hi> that <hi>I my self
exist,</hi> because <hi>I see this Wax;</hi> for it may
be that this that I see is not really Wax,
also it may be that I have no eyes
wherewith to see any thing; but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be, when I <hi>see,</hi> or (which is the same
thing) when <hi>I think that I see,</hi> that I who
<hi>think</hi> should not <hi>exist.</hi> The same thing
will follow if I <hi>judge that this Wax exists,</hi>
because I <hi>touch,</hi> or <hi>imagine</hi> it, &amp;c. And
what has been said of Wax, may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
to all other outward things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:99518:22"/>Moreover, if the <hi>notion</hi> of Wax seems
more <hi>distinct</hi> after it is made known to me,
not only by my <hi>sight</hi> or <hi>touch,</hi> but by more
and other causes; How much the more
<hi>distinctly</hi> must I confess my <hi>self known</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my <hi>self,</hi> seeing that all sort of reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which furthers me in the <hi>peroeption</hi>
of <hi>Wax,</hi> or any other <hi>Body,</hi> does also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the proofs of the <hi>nature</hi> of my
<hi>Mind.</hi> But there are so many more
things in the very <hi>Mind</hi> it self, by which
the <hi>notion</hi> of it may be made more <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,</hi>
that those things which drawn from
<hi>Body</hi> conduce to its knowledge are scarce
to be <hi>mention'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now behold of my own accord
am I come to the place I would be in;
for seeing I have now discover'd that <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
themselves</hi> are not <hi>properly perceived</hi>
by our <hi>senses</hi> or <hi>imagination,</hi> but only by
our <hi>understanding,</hi> and are not therefore
<hi>perceived,</hi> because they are <hi>felt</hi> or <hi>seen,</hi>
but because they are <hi>understood;</hi> it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appears to me, that nothing can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be <hi>perceived</hi> by <hi>me easier,</hi> or more <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,</hi>
than my <hi>Mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But because I cannot so soon shake off
the Acquaintance of my former Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99518:22"/>
I am willing to stop here, that this my

               <p>I am a <hi>Thinking Thing,</hi> that is to say,

For (as before I have noted) though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

of <hi>thinking</hi> which I call <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination</hi>
(as they are only certain <hi>Modes</hi> of
<hi>Thinking</hi>) I am certain are in Me. So
that in these few Words I have mention'd
whatever I <hi>know,</hi> or at least Whatever as
yet I <hi>perceive</hi> my self to <hi>know.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now will I look about me more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to see Whether there Be not some
other Thing in Me, of Which I have not
yet taken Notice. I am sure That I am a
<hi>Thinking Thing,</hi> and therefore Do not I
know what is Required to make me <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
of any Thing? I Answer, that in this My
<hi>first knowledge 'tis</hi> Nothing but a <hi>clear,</hi> and
<hi>distinct perception</hi> of What I affirm, Which
would not be sufficient to make me <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
of the <hi>Truth</hi> of a Thing, if it were
<hi>Possible</hi> that any thing that I so <hi>clearly</hi> and
<hi>distinctly</hi> Perceive should be <hi>false.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I may lay this Down as a <hi>Principle.
Whatever I Clearly and Distinctly perceive is
certainly True.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I have formerly Admitted of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Things as very <hi>Certain</hi> and <hi>manifest.</hi>
Which I afterwards found to be <hi>doubtful</hi>
Therefore What sort of Things were
they? <hi>Viz.</hi> Heaven, Earth, Stars, and all
other things which I perceived by my
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99518:23"/>
                  <hi>Senses.</hi> But What did I Perceive of These
<hi>Clearly? Viz.</hi> That I had the <hi>Ideas</hi> or
<hi>Thoughts</hi> of these things in my mind, and
at Present I cannot deny that I have these
<hi>Ideas</hi> in Mee. But there was some other
thing Which I affirm'd, and Which (by
Reason of the common Way of Belief) I
thought that I <hi>Clearly</hi> Perceived; Which
nevertheless, I did not really Perceive;
And that was, that there were Certain
Things <hi>Without Me</hi> from whence these <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas
Proceeded,</hi> and to which they were
exactly like. And this it was, Wherein I
was either <hi>Deceived,</hi> or if by Chance I
Judged <hi>truly,</hi> yet it Proceeded not from
the strength of my <hi>Perception.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But When I was exercised about any
single and easie Proposition in Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
or Geometry, as that two and three,
added make five, Did not I Perceive them
<hi>Clearly</hi> enough to make me affirm them
True? Truly concerning these I had no
other Reason afterwards to <hi>Doubt,</hi> but
That I thought Perhaps there may be a
<hi>God</hi> who might have so created me, that I
should be <hi>Deceived</hi> even in those things
which seem'd most <hi>Clear</hi> to me. And as
often as this Pre-conceived opinion of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99518:24"/>
                  <hi>Gods great Power</hi> comes into my Mind, I
cannot but Confess that he may easily
cause me to <hi>Err</hi> even in those things which
I Think I perceive most <hi>Evidently</hi> with my
Mind; yet as often as I Consider the
Things themselves, which I Judge my
self to perceive so <hi>Clearly,</hi> I am so fully
Perswaded by them, that I easily Break
out into these Expressions, Let Who can
Deceive Me, yet he shall never Cause me
<hi>Not to Be</hi> whilst <hi>I think that I Am,</hi> or that
it shall ever be True, <hi>that I never was,</hi>
Whilst at Present 'tis True <hi>that I am,</hi> or
Perhaps, that Two and Three added make
More or Less then Five; for in These
things I Percieve a Manifest Repugnancy;
And truely seeing I have no reason to
Think any <hi>God</hi> a <hi>Deceiver,</hi> Nor as yet ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know Whether there Be <hi>any God,</hi> or
<hi>Not,</hi> 'Tis but a slight and (as I may say)
Metaphysical Reason of Doubt, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
only on that opinion of which I am
not yet Perswaded.</p>
               <p>Wherefore That this Hindrance may be
taken away, When I have time I ought to
Enquire, Whether there <hi>Be a God,</hi> And if
there be One, Whether he can be a <hi>Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
For whilst I am <hi>Ignorant</hi> of this, I
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99518:24"/>
cannot possibly be fully <hi>Certain</hi> of any O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing.</p>
               <p>But now Method seems to Require Me
to Rank all My Thoughts under certain
Heads, and to search in Which of them
<hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Falshood</hi> properly Consists. Some
of them are (as it were) the <hi>Images</hi> of
Things, and to these alone the Name of
an <hi>Idea</hi> properly belongs, as When I think
upon a Man, A Chimera or Monster, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
an Angel, or <hi>God.</hi> But there are O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of them, that have <hi>superadded Forms</hi>
to them, as when I Will, when I Fear,
when I Affirm, when I Deny. I know I
have alwayes (when ever I think) some
certain Thing as the <hi>subject</hi> or <hi>object</hi> of my
Thought, but in this last sort of thoughts
there is something <hi>more</hi> which I Think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
then Barely the likeness of the Thing.
And of these Thoughts some are called
<hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> and Others of them
<hi>Iudgments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as touching <hi>Ideas,</hi> if they be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
alone as they are in themselves,
without <hi>Respect</hi> to any other Things, they
cannot Properly be <hi>false;</hi> for Whether I
<hi>Imagine</hi> a Goat or a Chimera, 'tis as <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
that I <hi>Imagine</hi> one as t' other. Also in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99518:25"/>
the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> I need not Fear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Falshood,</hi> For tho I should <hi>Wish</hi> for <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Things,</hi> or Things that are Not, it is
not therefore <hi>Not true</hi> that I Wish for
them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore there onely Remains my
<hi>Iudgments</hi> of Things, in which I must
take Care that I be not <hi>deceived.</hi> Now
the Chief and most usual <hi>Error</hi> that I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
in them is, That I <hi>Iudge</hi> Those <hi>Ideas</hi>
that are <hi>within</hi> me to be <hi>Conformable</hi> and
like to certain things that are <hi>without</hi> Me;
for truely if I Consider those Ideas as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Modes</hi> of my <hi>Thought,</hi> without Res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to any other Thing, they will scarce
afford me an Occasion of <hi>Erring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of these <hi>Ideas</hi> some are <hi>Innate,</hi> some
<hi>Adventitious,</hi> and some Others seem to Me
as Created by my self; For that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what <hi>A Thing</hi> Is, What is <hi>Truth,</hi>
What a <hi>Thought,</hi> seems to Proceed meerly
from my own <hi>Nature.</hi> But that I now
<hi>hear</hi> a Noise, <hi>see</hi> the Sun, or <hi>feel</hi> heat, <hi>I</hi>
have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alwayes <hi>Iudged</hi> to Proceed from
Things <hi>External.</hi> But Lastly, Mermaids,
Griffins, and such like Monsters, are <hi>made
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erly</hi> by <hi>My self.</hi> And yet <hi>I</hi> may well
think all of them either <hi>Adventitious,</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:99518:25"/>
or all of them <hi>Innate,</hi> or all of them <hi>made
by my self,</hi> for I have not as yet disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
their true <hi>Original.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>I</hi> ought cheifly to search after those
of them which <hi>I</hi> count <hi>Adventitious,</hi> and
which I consider as coming from <hi>outward
objects,</hi> that I may know what reason I
have to think them <hi>like</hi> the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
which they <hi>represent.</hi> Viz. <hi>Nature
so teaches Me;</hi> and also I know that I
they <hi>depend</hi> not on my <hi>Will,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>not on me;</hi> for they are often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with me against my inclinations,
or (as they say) in spite of my teeth,
as now whether <hi>I will</hi> or <hi>no</hi> I feel heat,
and therefore I think that the <hi>sense</hi> or <hi>Idea</hi>
of heat is propagated to me by a <hi>thing</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>distinct</hi> from <hi>my self,</hi> and that is by
the <hi>heat</hi> of the <hi>Fire</hi> at which I sit; And
nothing is more obvious then for me to
judge that That thing should transmit its
own <hi>Likeness</hi> into me, rather then that
any other thing should be transmitted by
it. Which sort of arguments whether
firme enough or not I shall now Trie.</p>
               <p>When I here say, that <hi>nature so teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
me,</hi> I understand only, that I am as it
were <hi>willingly forced</hi> to beleive it, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99518:26"/>
not that tis <hi>discover'd</hi> to me to be <hi>true</hi>
by any <hi>natural light;</hi> for these two differ
very much. For whatever is discover'd
to me by the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> (as that it
necessarily Follows <hi>that I am,</hi> because <hi>I
think</hi>) cannot possibly be <hi>doubted;</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I am endowed with no other <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,</hi>
in which I may put so great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as I can in the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>nature;</hi> or
<hi>which</hi> can possibly tell me, that those
things are <hi>false,</hi> which <hi>natural light</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
me to be <hi>true;</hi> and as to my <hi>natural
Inclinations,</hi> I have heretofore often
judged my self led by them to the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>worst part,</hi> when I was in the
choosing <hi>one</hi> of two Goods; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I see no reason why I should ever <hi>trust</hi>
them in any other thing.</p>
               <p>And then, tho these <hi>Ideas depend not</hi>
on my <hi>will,</hi> it does not therefore follow
that they <hi>necessarily proceed</hi> from <hi>things
external.</hi> For as, Altho those <hi>Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
(which I but now mention'd) are in
me, yet they seem <hi>distinct</hi> and <hi>different</hi>
from my <hi>will;</hi> so perhaps there may be
in me some other <hi>faculty</hi> (to me <hi>unknown</hi>)
which may prove the <hi>Efficient cause</hi> of
these <hi>Ideas,</hi> as hitherto I have observed
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99518:26"/>
them to be formed in me whilst I <hi>dream,</hi>
without the help of any <hi>External Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And last of all, tho they should <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed</hi>
from things which are <hi>different</hi> from
me, it does not therefore follow that they
must be <hi>like</hi> those things. For often times
I have found the <hi>thing</hi> and the <hi>Idea dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi>
much. As for example, I find in
my self two divers <hi>Ideas</hi> of the Sun, <hi>one</hi>
as <hi>received</hi> by my <hi>senses</hi> (and which cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I reckon among those I call adventiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous)
by which it appears to me very <hi>smal,
* another</hi> as taken from the arguments of
Astronomers (that is to say, <hi>consequentially
collected,</hi> or some other ways made by me
from certain <hi>natural notions</hi>) by which
'tis rendred something bigger then the
Globe of the Earth. Certainly both of
these cannot be <hi>like</hi> that sun which is <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
me,</hi> and my reason perswades me, that
that <hi>Idea</hi> is most <hi>unlike</hi> the Sun, which
seems to <hi>proceed Immediately</hi> from it
self.</p>
               <p>All which things sufficiently prove, that
I have hitherto (not from a <hi>true judgement,</hi>
but from a <hi>blind impulse</hi>) beleived that
there are certain things <hi>different</hi> from my
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99518:27"/>
self, and which have sent their <hi>Ideas</hi> or
<hi>Images</hi> into me by the Organs of my <hi>senses,</hi>
or some other way.</p>
               <p>But I have yet an other Way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring,
whether any of those Things
(whose <hi>Ideas</hi> I have <hi>within</hi> Me) are Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Existent <hi>without</hi> Me; And that is Thus:
As those <hi>Ideas</hi> are only <hi>Modes</hi> of <hi>Thinking,</hi>
I acknowledge no <hi>Inequality</hi> between
them, and they all proceed from me in
the <hi>same Manner.</hi> But as <hi>one</hi> Represents
<hi>one thing,</hi> an <hi>other,</hi> an <hi>other Thing,</hi> 'tis Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
there is a <hi>Great difference</hi> between
them. * For without doubt, Those of them
which Represent <hi>Substances</hi> are something
<hi>More,</hi> or (as I may say) have <hi>More</hi> of <hi>Objective
Reallity</hi> in them, then those that Represent
only <hi>Modes</hi> or <hi>Accidents;</hi> and again, <hi>That</hi>
by Which I understand a <hi>Mighty God, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
Infinite, Omniscient, Omnipotent
Creatour</hi> of all things besides himself, has
certainly in it <hi>more Objective Reallity,</hi> then
Those <hi>Ideas</hi> by which <hi>Finite Substances</hi> are
Exhibited.</p>
               <p>But Now, it is evident by the <hi>Light</hi> of
<hi>Nature</hi> that there must be <hi>as much</hi> at least
in the <hi>Total efficient Cause,</hi> as there is in
the <hi>Effect</hi> of <hi>that Cause;</hi> For from Whence
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99518:27"/>
can the <hi>effect</hi> have its <hi>Reallity,</hi> but from the
<hi>Cause?</hi> and how can the <hi>Cause</hi> give it that
<hi>Reallity,</hi> unless <hi>it self have</hi> it?</p>
               <p>And from hence it follows, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a <hi>Thing</hi> can be made out of <hi>Nothing,</hi>
Neither a Thing which is <hi>more Perfect</hi>
(that is, Which has in it self <hi>more Reallity</hi>)
<hi>proceed</hi> from That Which is <hi>Less Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is <hi>Clearly</hi> True, not only in
those <hi>Effects</hi> whose <hi>Actual</hi> or <hi>Formal Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
is Consider'd, But in Those <hi>Ideas</hi> also,
Whose <hi>Objective Reallity</hi> is only Respected;
That is to say, for Example of Illustrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it is not only impossible that a stone,
Which <hi>was not,</hi> should now begin <hi>to Be,</hi>
unless it were produced by <hi>something,</hi> in
Which, Whatever goes to the Making a
Stone, is either <hi>Formally</hi> or <hi>Virtually;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can <hi>heat</hi> he Produced in any Thing,
which before was <hi>not hot,</hi> but by a Thing
which is at least of as equal a <hi>degree</hi> of
<hi>Perfection</hi> as <hi>heat</hi> is; But also 'tis Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that I should have an <hi>Idea</hi> of Heat,
or of a <hi>Stone,</hi> unless it were put into me
by some <hi>Cause,</hi> in which there is at Least
as much <hi>Reallity,</hi> as I Conceive there is in
Heat or a Stone. For tho that <hi>Cause</hi> trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99518:28"/>
none of its own <hi>Actual</hi> or <hi>Formal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality</hi>
into my <hi>Idea,</hi> I must not from
thence conclude that 'tis <hi>less real;</hi> but I
may think that the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Idea</hi> it
self is such, that of it self it requires no
other <hi>formal reality,</hi> but what it has from
my <hi>thought,</hi> of which 'tis a <hi>mode.</hi> But
that this Idea has <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that objective re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allity,</hi>
rather then any <hi>other,</hi> proceeds
clearly from some <hi>cause,</hi> in which there
ought to be at least as much <hi>formal real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
as there is of <hi>objective reallity</hi> in the
<hi>Idea</hi> it self. For if we suppose any thing
in the <hi>Idea,</hi> which was not in its <hi>cause,</hi> it
must of necessity have this from <hi>nothing;</hi>
but (tho it be a most <hi>Imperfect manner</hi> of
<hi>existing,</hi> by which the thing is <hi>objectively</hi>
in the <hi>Intellect</hi> by an <hi>Idea,</hi> yet) it is not
<hi>altogether nothing,</hi> and therefore cannot
proceed from <hi>nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither ought I to doubt, seeing the
<hi>reallity</hi> which I perceive in my <hi>Ideas</hi> is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an <hi>objective reallity,</hi> that therefore it
must of necessity follow, that the same
<hi>reallity</hi> should be in the <hi>causes</hi> of these
<hi>Ideas formally.</hi> But I may conclude, that
'tis sufficient that this <hi>reallity</hi> be in the very
<hi>causes</hi> only <hi>objectively.</hi> For as that <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99518:28"/>
manner</hi> of <hi>being</hi> appertains to the
very <hi>nature</hi> of an <hi>Idea,</hi> so that <hi>formal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
of <hi>being</hi> appertains to the very <hi>nature</hi>
of a <hi>cause</hi> of <hi>Ideas,</hi> at least to the <hi>first</hi> and
<hi>chiefest causes</hi> of them; For tho perhaps
one <hi>Idea</hi> may receive its birth from an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet we cannot proceed in <hi>Infinitum,</hi>
but at last we must arrive at some <hi>first Idea,</hi>
whose <hi>cause</hi> is (as it were) an <hi>Original
copy,</hi> in which all the <hi>objective reallity</hi> of
the <hi>Idea</hi> is <hi>formally contain'd.</hi> So that I
plainly discover by the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> that
the <hi>Ideas,</hi> which are in me, are (as it
were) <hi>Pictures,</hi> which may easily <hi>come
short</hi> of the <hi>perfection</hi> of those things from
whence they are taken, but cannot <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
any thing <hi>greater</hi> or <hi>more perfect</hi> then
them: And the <hi>longer</hi> and <hi>more diligently</hi>
I pry into these things, so much the more
<hi>clearly</hi> and <hi>distinctly</hi> do I discover them
to be <hi>true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what shall I conclude from hence?
Thus, that if the <hi>objective reallity</hi> of any
of my <hi>Ideas</hi> be <hi>such,</hi> that it cannot be in
me either <hi>formarlly</hi> or <hi>eminently,</hi> and that
therefore I cannot be the <hi>cause</hi> of <hi>that Idea,</hi>
from hence it necessarily Follows, that <hi>I
alone</hi> do not only <hi>exist,</hi> but that some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99518:29"/>
thing, which is the <hi>cause</hi> of that <hi>Idea,</hi>
does <hi>exist also.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if I can find no <hi>such Idea</hi> in me, I
have no argument to perswade me of the
<hi>existence</hi> of any thing besides my self for
I have diligently enquired, and hitherto
I could discover no other <hi>perswasive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some of these <hi>Ideas</hi> there are (besides
that which represents <hi>my self</hi> to <hi>my self,</hi>
of which in this place I cannot doubt)
which represent to me, one of them a
<hi>God,</hi> others of them <hi>Corporeal</hi> and <hi>Inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi>
things, some of them <hi>Angels,</hi> others
<hi>Animals,</hi> and lastly some of them which
exhibite to me <hi>men like my self.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As touching those that represent <hi>Men</hi>
or <hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>Animals,</hi> I easily understand
that they may be <hi>made up</hi> of those <hi>Ideas</hi>
which I have of <hi>my self,</hi> of <hi>Corporeal</hi> things,
and of <hi>God,</hi> tho there were neither <hi>man</hi>
(but my self) nor <hi>Angel,</hi> nor <hi>Animal</hi> in
being</p>
               <p>And as to the <hi>Ideas</hi> of <hi>Corporeal</hi> things,
I find nothing in them of that <hi>perfection,</hi>
but it may proceed from my self; for if I
look into them more narrowly, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
them more particularly, as yesterday
(<hi>in the second Medit.</hi>) I did the <hi>Idea</hi> of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99518:29"/>
Wax, I find there are but few things
which I perceive <hi>clearly</hi> and <hi>distinctly</hi> in
them, viz. <hi>Magnitude</hi> or <hi>extension</hi> in
<hi>Longitude, Latitude,</hi> and <hi>Profundity,</hi> the
<hi>Figure</hi> or <hi>shape</hi> which arises from the <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi>
of that <hi>Extension,</hi> the <hi>Position</hi> or
<hi>place</hi> which divers <hi>Figured Bodies</hi> have
in <hi>respect</hi> of each other, their <hi>motion</hi> or
<hi>change of place;</hi> to which may be added,
their <hi>substance, continuance,</hi> and <hi>number;</hi>
as to the other, such as are, <hi>Light, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
Sounds, Smels, Tasts, Heat,</hi> and
<hi>Cold,</hi> with the other <hi>tactile qualities,</hi> I
have but very <hi>obscure</hi> and <hi>confused thoughts</hi>
of them, so that I know not, whether
they are <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false,</hi> that is to say, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Ideas</hi> I have of them are the <hi>Ideas</hi>
of <hi>things</hi> which <hi>really are,</hi> or <hi>are not.</hi> For
altho <hi>falshood formally</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
consists only in the <hi>judgement</hi> (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I have observed) yet there is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sort of <hi>material falshood</hi> in <hi>Ideas,</hi> when
they represent a <hi>thing</hi> as <hi>really existent,</hi>
tho it does <hi>not exist;</hi> so, for example,
the <hi>Ideas</hi> I have of <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>cold</hi> are so <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure</hi> and <hi>confused,</hi> that I cannot collect
from them, whether <hi>cold</hi> be a <hi>privation</hi> of
<hi>heat,</hi> or <hi>heat</hi> a <hi>privation</hi> of <hi>cold,</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99518:30"/>
either of them be a <hi>real quality,</hi> or
whether neither of them be <hi>real.</hi> And
since every <hi>Idea</hi> must be <hi>like</hi> the thing it
represents, if it be <hi>true</hi> that <hi>cold</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the <hi>privation</hi> of <hi>heat,</hi> that <hi>Idea</hi>
which represents it to me as a thing <hi>real</hi>
and <hi>positive</hi> may deservedly be called
<hi>false.</hi> The same may be apply'd to other
Ideas.</p>
               <p>And now I see no necessity why I
should assigne any other <hi>Author</hi> of these
<hi>Ideas</hi> but <hi>my self;</hi> for if they are <hi>false,</hi> that
is, represent things that <hi>are not,</hi> I know
by the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> that they proceed
from <hi>nothing;</hi> that is to say, I harbour
them upon no other account, but because
my <hi>nature</hi> is <hi>deficient</hi> in something, and
<hi>imperfect.</hi> But if they are <hi>true,</hi> yet seeing
I discover so little <hi>reality</hi> in them, that
that very <hi>reality</hi> scarce <hi>seems</hi> to <hi>be realy,</hi>
I see no reason why I my self should not be
the <hi>Author</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>But also some of those very <hi>Ideas</hi> of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal</hi>
things which are <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>distinct,</hi>
I may seem to have borrow'd from
the <hi>Idea</hi> I have of <hi>my self,</hi> viz. <hi>Substance,
duration, number,</hi> and the like; For
when I conceive a <hi>stone</hi> to be a <hi>substance</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:99518:30"/>
(that is, <hi>a thing apt of it self to exist</hi>) and
also that I <hi>my self</hi> am a <hi>substance,</hi> tho I
conceive <hi>my self</hi> a <hi>thinking substance</hi> and
<hi>not extended,</hi> and the <hi>stone</hi> an <hi>extended
substance</hi> and <hi>not thinking,</hi> by which there
is a great <hi>diversity</hi> between both the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,</hi>
yet they <hi>agree</hi> in this, that they
are <hi>both substances.</hi> So when I conceive
my self as <hi>now</hi> in being, and also remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that <hi>heretofore</hi> I <hi>have been;</hi> and since
I have <hi>divers</hi> thoughts, which I can <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
or <hi>count;</hi> from hence it is that I
come by the notions of <hi>duration</hi> and
<hi>number;</hi> which afterwards I apply to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things.</p>
               <p>As to those other things, of which the
<hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>body</hi> is made up, as <hi>extension,
figure, place</hi> and <hi>motion,</hi> they are not <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally</hi>
in me, seeing I am only a <hi>thinking
thing;</hi> yet seeing they are only certain
<hi>modes</hi> of <hi>substance,</hi> and I my self also am
a <hi>substance,</hi> they may seem to be in me
<hi>eminently.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* Wherefore there only Remains the <hi>Idea</hi>
of a <hi>God,</hi> wherein I must consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be not something included,
which cannot possibly have its <hi>original</hi>
from me. By the word <hi>God,</hi> I mean a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99518:31"/>
certain <hi>Infinite Substance, Independent,
Omniscient, Almighty,</hi> by whom both <hi>I
my self,</hi> and every thing else that <hi>is</hi> (if any
thing do <hi>Actualy exist</hi>) was created. All
which <hi>Attributes</hi> are of such an <hi>high na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
that the more attentively I consider
them, the less I conceive my self possible
to be the <hi>Author</hi> of these notions.</p>
               <p>From what therefore has been said I
must conclude that there is a <hi>God;</hi> for
tho the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>substance</hi> may arise in me,
because that I my self am a <hi>substance,</hi> yet
I could not have the <hi>Idea</hi> of an <hi>Infinite
substance</hi> (seing I my self am <hi>finite</hi>) unless
it proceeded from a <hi>substance</hi> which is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Infinite.</hi> Neither ought I to think
that I have no <hi>true Idea</hi> of <hi>Infinity,</hi> or
that I perceive it only by the <hi>negation</hi> of
what is <hi>finite,</hi> as I conceive <hi>rest</hi> and <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
by the <hi>negation</hi> or <hi>absence</hi> of <hi>motion</hi> or
<hi>light.</hi> But on the contrary I plainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that there is <hi>more reality</hi> in an
<hi>Infinite substance,</hi> then in a <hi>Finite;</hi> and
that therefore the <hi>perception</hi> of an <hi>Infinite</hi>
(as <hi>God</hi>) is <hi>antecedent</hi> to the <hi>notion</hi> I have
of a <hi>finite</hi> (as <hi>my self</hi>) For how should I
know that I <hi>doubt</hi> or <hi>desire,</hi> that is to say,
that I <hi>want</hi> something, and that I am <hi>not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99518:31"/>
altogether perfect,</hi> unless I had the <hi>Idea</hi> of
a <hi>being more perfect</hi> then <hi>my self,</hi> by <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring</hi>
my self to which I may discover my
own <hi>Imperfections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither can it be said that this <hi>Idea</hi> of
<hi>God</hi> is <hi>false Materialiter,</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it <hi>proceeds</hi> from <hi>nothing,</hi> as before I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
of the <hi>Ideas</hi> of <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>cold,</hi> &amp;c.
For on the contrary, seeing this <hi>notion</hi> is
most <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>distinct,</hi> and contains in it
self more <hi>objective reality</hi> then any other
<hi>Idea,</hi> none can be more <hi>true</hi> in it self,
nor in which less <hi>suspition</hi> of <hi>flalshood</hi> can
be found. This <hi>Idea</hi> (I say) of a <hi>being
infinitely perfect</hi> is most <hi>true,</hi> for tho it may
be supposed that such a <hi>being</hi> does <hi>not exist,</hi>
yet it cannot be supposed that the <hi>Idea</hi>
of such a <hi>being</hi> exhibites to me nothing <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi>
as before I have said of the <hi>Idea</hi> of
<hi>cold.</hi> This <hi>Idea</hi> also is most <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,</hi>
for whatever I perceive <hi>clearly</hi> and
<hi>distinctly</hi> to be <hi>real,</hi> and <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi>
is wholy <hi>contain'd</hi> in this <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither can it be objected, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<hi>comprehend</hi> an <hi>Infinite,</hi> or that there
are innumerable other things in <hi>God,</hi>
which I can neither <hi>conceive,</hi> nor in the
least <hi>think upon;</hi> for it is of the <hi>very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:99518:32"/>
of an <hi>Infinite</hi> not to be <hi>apprehendable</hi> by
<hi>me</hi> who am <hi>finite.</hi> And 'tis sufficient to
me to prove this my <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to be the
most <hi>true,</hi> the most <hi>clear,</hi> and the most
<hi>distinct Idea</hi> of all those <hi>Ideas</hi> I have, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this <hi>account,</hi> that I understand that <hi>God</hi>
is <hi>not to be understood,</hi> and that I judge
that whatever I <hi>clearly</hi> perceive and know
<hi>Implys</hi> any <hi>perfection,</hi> as also perhaps other
innumerable <hi>perfections,</hi> which I am ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of, are in <hi>God</hi> either <hi>formally</hi> or
<hi>eminently.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doubt.</hi> But perhaps <hi>I am</hi> something
<hi>more</hi> then I take my self to <hi>be,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
all these <hi>perfections</hi> which I attribute
to <hi>God,</hi> are <hi>potentially</hi> in me, tho at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
they do not shew themselves, and
break into action. For I am now fully
experienced that my <hi>Knowledge</hi> may be
<hi>encreased,</hi> and I see nothing that hinders
Why it may not <hi>encrease</hi> by degrees in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum,</hi>
nor why by my <hi>knowledge</hi> so <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased</hi>
I may not attain to the other <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi>
of <hi>God;</hi> nor lastly, why the <hi>power</hi>
or <hi>aptitude</hi> of <hi>having</hi> these perfections
may not be sufficient to produce the <hi>Idea</hi>
of them in <hi>me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solution.</hi> But none of these will do;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99518:32"/>
for first, tho it be true that my <hi>Knowledge</hi>
is capable of being <hi>increased,</hi> and that
many things are in me <hi>potentially,</hi> which
<hi>actually</hi> are not, yet none of these go to
the making an <hi>Idea</hi> of God, in which I
conceive nothing <hi>potentially,</hi> for tis a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
argument of <hi>imperfection</hi> that a thing
<hi>may be encreased Gradually.</hi> Moreover,
tho my knowledge may be <hi>more</hi> and <hi>more
encreased,</hi> yet I know that it can never
be <hi>actually Infinite,</hi> for it can never ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
to that <hi>height</hi> of <hi>perfection,</hi> which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
not of an <hi>higher degree.</hi> But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
God to be <hi>actually</hi> so <hi>Infinite,</hi> that
nothing can be <hi>added</hi> to his <hi>perfections,</hi>
And lastly, I perceive that the <hi>objective be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of an <hi>Idea</hi> cannot be <hi>produced</hi> only by
the <hi>potential being</hi> of a <hi>thing</hi> (which in
proper speech is <hi>nothing</hi>) but requires an
<hi>actual</hi> or <hi>formal being</hi> to its <hi>production.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of all which forementioned things
there is nothing that is not <hi>evident</hi> by the
<hi>light</hi> of <hi>reason</hi> to any one that will dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
consider them. Yet because that
(when I am careless, and the <hi>Images</hi> of
<hi>sensible</hi> things <hi>blind</hi> my <hi>understanding</hi>) I
do not so easily call to mind the reasons,
why the <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>being more perfect</hi> then
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99518:33"/>
                  <hi>my self</hi> should of necessity proceed from a
<hi>being</hi> which is <hi>really more perfect;</hi> It will
be requisite to enquire further, whether
<hi>I,</hi> who have this <hi>Idea,</hi> can possibly <hi>be,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<hi>such</hi> a <hi>being</hi> did <hi>exist.</hi> To which end
let me aske, <hi>from whence</hi> should I <hi>be?</hi> From
<hi>my self?</hi> or from my <hi>Parents?</hi> or from
any other thing <hi>less perfect</hi> then <hi>God?</hi> for
nothing can be thought or supposed
<hi>more perfect,</hi> or <hi>equally perfect</hi> with <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But first, If <hi>I</hi> were from my self, I should
neither <hi>doubt,</hi> nor <hi>desire,</hi> nor <hi>want</hi> any
thing, for I should have given my self all
those <hi>perfections,</hi> of which I have any <hi>Idea,</hi>
and consequently I my self should be
<hi>God;</hi> and I cannot think that those
things I <hi>want,</hi> are to be acquired with <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
difficulty</hi> then those things I <hi>have;</hi> but
on the contrary, tis manifiest, that it were
much more <hi>difficult</hi> that <hi>I</hi> (that is, <hi>a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
that <hi>thinks</hi>) should <hi>arise</hi> out of
<hi>nothing,</hi> then that I should <hi>acquire</hi> the
<hi>knowledge</hi> of many things whereof I am
<hi>Ignorant,</hi> which is only the <hi>accident</hi> of
that <hi>substance,</hi> And certainly If I had
that <hi>greater thing</hi> (viz <hi>being</hi>) from my
self, I should not have <hi>denyed</hi> my self (not
only those things which may be easier ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99518:33"/>
but also) All those things, which I
perceived are contain'd in the <hi>Idea</hi> of a
<hi>God;</hi> and the reason is, for that no other
things <hi>seem</hi> to me to be <hi>more difficultly</hi>
done, and certainly if they were <hi>Really
more difficult,</hi> they would <hi>seem</hi> more <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult</hi>
to me (if whatever <hi>I have,</hi> I <hi>have</hi>
from my self) for in those things I should
find my <hi>Power</hi> put to a stop.</p>
               <p>Neither can I Evade the force of these
Arguments by supposing my self to <hi>have
alwaies Been, what now I am,</hi> and that
therefore I need not seek for an <hi>Author</hi>
of my <hi>Being.</hi> For the <hi>Durance</hi> or <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation</hi>
of my life may be <hi>divided</hi> into
<hi>Innumerable Parts,</hi> each of which does not
at all <hi>depend</hi> on the <hi>Other Parts;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it will not follow, that because <hi>a while
ago, I was,</hi> I must of necessity <hi>now Be.</hi> I
say, this will not follow, Unless, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
some <hi>Cause</hi> to <hi>Create me</hi> (as it were)
<hi>anew</hi> for <hi>this</hi> Moment (that is, <hi>Conserve me</hi>)
For 'tis evident to one that Considers the
Nature of <hi>Duration,</hi> that the same <hi>Power</hi>
and <hi>Action</hi> is requisite to the <hi>Conservation</hi>
of a Thing each <hi>Moment</hi> of its <hi>Being,</hi> as
there is to the <hi>Creation</hi> of that Thing <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new,</hi>
if it did <hi>not exist.</hi> So that 'tis one
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99518:34"/>
of those <hi>Principles</hi> which are <hi>Evident</hi> by
the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Nature:</hi> that the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation</hi>
differs only <hi>Ratione</hi> (as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
term it) from the <hi>Act of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore I ought to ask my self this
Question, whether <hi>I,</hi> who <hi>now</hi> Am; have
any <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>Cause</hi> my self to <hi>Be hereafter?</hi>
(for had I any such <hi>power,</hi> I should certainly
<hi>know</hi> of it, seeing I am nothing but a <hi>Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Thing,</hi> or at least at present I onely
treat of that part of me, which is a <hi>Thing</hi>
that <hi>Thinks</hi>) to which, I answer, that I
can discover no such <hi>Power</hi> in Me; And
consequently, I evidently know that <hi>I
depend</hi> on some <hi>Other being distinct</hi> from
<hi>my self.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what if <hi>I</hi> say that perhaps this <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
is not <hi>God,</hi> but that <hi>I</hi> am produced ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by my <hi>Parents,</hi> or some other <hi>Causes
less perfect</hi> then <hi>God?</hi> In answer to which
let me consider (as <hi>I</hi> have said before that
'tis <hi>manifest</hi> that whatever is in the <hi>effect,
so much</hi> at least ought to be in the <hi>cause;</hi>
and therefore seeing <hi>I</hi> am a thing that
<hi>thinks,</hi> and have in me an <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> it
will confessedly follow, that whatever
sort of <hi>cause I</hi> assign of my <hi>own Being,</hi> it
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99518:34"/>
also must be a <hi>Thinking Thing,</hi> and must
have an <hi>Idea</hi> of all those <hi>Perfections,</hi> which
I attribute to <hi>God;</hi> Of which <hi>Cause</hi> it
may be again Asked, whether it be <hi>from
it self,</hi> or from any other <hi>Cause?</hi> If <hi>from
it self,</hi>'tis evident (from what has been
said) that it must be <hi>God;</hi> For seeing it
has the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Existing of it self,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt it has also the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>actually
Possessing</hi> all those <hi>Perfections</hi> whereof it
has an <hi>Idea</hi> in it self, that is, all those <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi>
which I conceive in <hi>God.</hi> But if
it Be from an <hi>other Cause,</hi> it may again be
asked of that <hi>Cause</hi> whether it be <hi>of it
self,</hi> or from an <hi>other;</hi> Till at length We
arrive at the <hi>Last Cause</hi> of All, Which
will Be <hi>God.</hi> For 'tis evident, that this
<hi>Enquiry</hi> will not admit of <hi>Progressus in
Infinitum,</hi> especially when at Present I
treat not only of that Cause which at <hi>first
made</hi> Me; But chiefly of that which <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves</hi>
me in this <hi>Instant</hi> time.</p>
               <p>Neither can it be supposed that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>partial Causes</hi> have <hi>concurred</hi> to the
making Me, and that I received the <hi>Idea</hi>
of one of <hi>Gods perfections</hi> from <hi>One</hi> of
them, and from an <hi>other</hi> of them the
<hi>Idea</hi> of an <hi>other;</hi> and that therefore all
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99518:35"/>
these Perfections are to be found <hi>scattered</hi>
in the World, but not all of them <hi>Ioyn'd</hi>
in any one which may Be <hi>God.</hi> For on
the contrary, <hi>Vnity, Simplicity,</hi> or the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separability</hi>
of All Gods Attributes is one
of the <hi>chief Perfections</hi> which I conceive
in Him; and certainly the <hi>Idea</hi> of the
<hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Perfections</hi> could not
be <hi>created</hi> in me by any other <hi>cause,</hi> then
by <hi>That,</hi> from whence I have received the
<hi>Ideas</hi> of his other <hi>perfections;</hi> For 'tis Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to make me conceive these <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
conjunct</hi> and <hi>inseparable,</hi> unless he
should also make me know what <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
these <hi>are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly as touching my <hi>having</hi> my <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
from my <hi>Parents.</hi> Tho whatever
Thoughts I have heretofore harbour'd of
Them were <hi>True,</hi> yet certainly they <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute</hi>
nothing to my <hi>conservation,</hi> neither
proceed I from them as <hi>I am</hi> a <hi>Thing</hi> that
<hi>Thinks,</hi> for they have onely <hi>predisposed</hi>
that <hi>material Thing,</hi> wherein <hi>I,</hi> that is, <hi>my
mind (which</hi> only at present I take for
<hi>my self) Inhabits.</hi> Wherefore I cannot
<hi>now</hi> Question that I am sprung from them.
But I must of necessity conclude that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>I am,</hi> and because I have an <hi>Idea</hi> of a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99518:35"/>
                  <hi>Being most perfect,</hi> that is, of <hi>God,</hi> it evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follows that <hi>there is a God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* Now it only remains for me to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
how I have received this <hi>Idea</hi> of
<hi>God.</hi> For I have neither received it by
<hi>means</hi> of <hi>my Senses,</hi> neither comes it to
me <hi>without</hi> my <hi>Forethought,</hi> as the <hi>Ideas</hi> of
<hi>sensible</hi> things use to do, when such things
<hi>Work</hi> on the <hi>Organs</hi> of my <hi>Sense,</hi> or at
least <hi>seem</hi> so to work; Neither is this <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi>
framed by <hi>my self,</hi> for I can neither
<hi>detract from,</hi> nor <hi>add</hi> any thing <hi>thereto.</hi>
Wherefore I have only to conclude that
it is <hi>Innate,</hi> even as the <hi>Idea</hi> of me <hi>my self</hi>
is <hi>Natural</hi> to my self.</p>
               <p>And truly 'tis not to be Admired that
<hi>God</hi> in Creating me should <hi>Imprint</hi> this <hi>Idea</hi>
in me, that it may there remain as a <hi>stamp
impressed</hi> by the <hi>Workman God</hi> on <hi>me</hi> his
<hi>Work,</hi> neither is it requisite that this
<hi>stamp</hi> should be a Thing <hi>different</hi> from
the <hi>Work</hi> it self, but 'tis very Credible
(from hence only that <hi>God Created</hi> me)
that I am made as it were according to
his <hi>likeness</hi> and <hi>Image,</hi> and that the same
<hi>likeness,</hi> in which the <hi>Idea</hi> of God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
is <hi>perceived</hi> by Me with the <hi>same
faculty,</hi> with which I <hi>perceive my Self;</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:99518:36"/>
That is to say, whilst <hi>I reflect</hi> upon my
self, <hi>I</hi> do not only <hi>perceive</hi> that I am
an <hi>Imperfect</hi> thing, having my <hi>dependance</hi>
upon some other thing, and that I am a
Thing that Desires <hi>more</hi> and <hi>better</hi> things
<hi>Indefinitely;</hi> But also at the same time I
understand, that <hi>He</hi> on whom I <hi>depend</hi>
contains in him all those <hi>wish'd for things</hi>
(not only <hi>Indefinitely</hi> and <hi>Potentially,</hi> but)
<hi>Really, Infinitely;</hi> and that therefore he is
<hi>God.</hi> The whole stress of which * Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
lies thus, because I know it Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for Me to Be of the same Nature I am,
<hi>Viz,</hi> Having the <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>God</hi> in me, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
really there were a <hi>God,</hi> a <hi>God</hi> (I say)
that very <hi>same God,</hi> whose <hi>Idea I</hi> have in
my <hi>Mind</hi> (that is, Having all those <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi>
which I cannot <hi>comprehend</hi>

is not <hi>subject</hi> to any <hi>Defects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which 'tis evident that <hi>God</hi> is no

of <hi>Nature,</hi> that all <hi>fraud</hi> and <hi>deceit</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
on some <hi>defect.</hi> But before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
this any farther, or pry into other
<hi>Truthes</hi> which may be deduced from this,
I am willing here to stop, and dwell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Contemplation of this <hi>God,</hi> to

Consider with my self His <hi>Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,</hi>
to behold, admire, and adore the
Loveliness of this <hi>Immense light,</hi> as much
as possibly I am able to accomplish with
my <hi>dark</hi> Understanding. For as by <hi>Faith</hi>
we <hi>believe</hi> that the greatest <hi>happiness</hi> of
the <hi>next Life</hi> consists alone in the <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation</hi>
of the <hi>Divine Majesty,</hi> so we <hi>find</hi>
by <hi>Experience</hi> that now we receive from

are capable in <hi>this Life;</hi> Tho it be

to <hi>Bodies</hi> that are <hi>truly</hi> perceived,
and that there are more Things touching
<hi>Mans mind,</hi> and yet more concerning
<hi>God,</hi> which are <hi>well known;</hi> that now
without any difficulty <hi>I</hi> can turn my
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99518:37"/>
Thoughts from things <hi>sensible,</hi> to those
which are only <hi>Intelligible,</hi> and <hi>Abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
from <hi>Matter.</hi> And truely <hi>I</hi> have a
much more <hi>distinct Idea</hi> of a <hi>Mans mind</hi>
(as it is a <hi>Thinking Thing,</hi> having no <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Dimensions</hi> of <hi>Length, Breadth,</hi> and
<hi>Thickness,</hi> nor having any other <hi>Corporeal
Quality</hi>) then the <hi>Idea</hi> of any <hi>Corporeal
Thing</hi> can be. And when I reflect upon my
self, and consider how that I <hi>doubt,</hi> that is,
am an <hi>imperfect dependent Being,</hi> I from hence
Collect such a <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>distinct Idea</hi> of an
<hi>Independent perfect Being,</hi> which is <hi>God,</hi>
and from hence only that <hi>I have such an
Idea,</hi> that is, because <hi>I</hi> that have this <hi>Idea</hi>
do <hi>my self Exist;</hi> I do so <hi>clearly</hi> conclude
that <hi>God also Exists,</hi> and that on him my
<hi>Being depends</hi> each Minute; That I am Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
nothing can be known more <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi>
and <hi>Certainly</hi> by <hi>Humane Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now <hi>I</hi> seem to perceive a <hi>Method</hi>
by which, (from this Contemplation of
the <hi>true God,</hi> in whom the Treasures of
<hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Wisdome</hi> are Hidden) <hi>I</hi>
may attain the <hi>Knowledg</hi> of other Things.</p>
               <p>And first, <hi>I</hi> know 'tis impossible that
this <hi>God</hi> should <hi>deceive</hi> me; For in all
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99518:37"/>
                  <hi>cheating</hi> and <hi>deceipt</hi> there is something of
<hi>imperfection;</hi> and tho to be <hi>able</hi> to <hi>deceive</hi>
may seem to be an Argument of <hi>ingenuity</hi>
and <hi>power,</hi> yet without doubt to <hi>have</hi> the
<hi>Will</hi> of <hi>deceiving</hi> is a sign of <hi>Malice</hi> and
<hi>Weakness,</hi> and therefore is not <hi>Incident</hi> to
<hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have also found in my self a <hi>Iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
faculty,</hi> which certainly (as all other
things I possess) I have received from <hi>God;</hi>
and seeing he will not <hi>deceive</hi> me, he has
surely given me such a <hi>Iudgement,</hi> that I
can <hi>never Err,</hi> whilst I make a <hi>Right Vse</hi>
of it. Of which truth I can make no
doubt, unless it seems, that From hence
it will follow, That therefore <hi>I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Err;</hi> for if whatever I have, I have
from <hi>God,</hi> and if he gave me no <hi>Faculty</hi>
of <hi>Erring,</hi> I may seem not to be <hi>able to Err.</hi>
And truly so it is whilst I think upon <hi>God,</hi>
and wholly convert my self to the <hi>consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi>
of him, I find no occasion of <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi>
or <hi>Deceit;</hi> but yet when I return to
the <hi>Contemplation</hi> of <hi>my self,</hi> I find my self
liable to <hi>Innumerable Errors.</hi> Enquiring
into the <hi>cause</hi> of which, I find in my self
an <hi>Idea,</hi> not only a <hi>real</hi> and <hi>positive one</hi> of
a <hi>God,</hi> that is, of a <hi>Being infinitely perfect,</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:99518:38"/>
but also (as I may so speak) a <hi>Negative I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi>
of <hi>Nothing;</hi> that is to say, I am so
constituted between God and Nothing
or between a perfect <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>No-being,</hi>
that as I am <hi>Created</hi> by the <hi>Highest Being,</hi>
I have nothing in Me by which I may be
<hi>deceived</hi> or drawn into <hi>Error;</hi> but as I
pertake in a manner of <hi>Nothing,</hi> or of a
<hi>No-Being,</hi> that is, as I my self am <hi>not</hi> the <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Being,</hi> and as I <hi>want</hi> many <hi>perfections,</hi>
'tis no Wonder that I should be <hi>Deceived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which I understand that <hi>Error</hi> * (as
it is <hi>Error</hi>) is not any <hi>real Being</hi> depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
on <hi>God,</hi> but it is only a <hi>Defect;</hi> And
that therefore to make me <hi>Err</hi> there
is not requisite a <hi>faculty</hi> of <hi>Erring</hi> given
me by <hi>God,</hi> but only it so happens that I
<hi>Err</hi> meerly because the <hi>Iudicative faculty,</hi>
which he has given me, is not <hi>Infinite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet this Account is not fully <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory;</hi>
for <hi>Error</hi> is not only a meer <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi>
but 'tis a <hi>Privation,</hi> or a <hi>want</hi> of a
certain <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which <hi>ought</hi> (as it were)
to be in me. And when I consider the
<hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> it seems impossible that
he should give me any <hi>faculty</hi> which is
not <hi>perfect</hi> in its <hi>kind,</hi> or which should
<hi>want</hi> any of its <hi>due perfections;</hi> for if by
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99518:38"/>
how much the more <hi>skilful</hi> the <hi>Workman</hi>
is, by so much the <hi>Perfecter Works</hi> proceed
from him. What can be made by the <hi>Great
Maker</hi> of all things which is not <hi>fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?</hi>
For I cannot Doubt but <hi>God</hi> may
<hi>Create</hi> me so that I may <hi>never</hi> be <hi>deceived,</hi>
neither can I doubt but that he <hi>Wills</hi>
whatever is <hi>Best;</hi> Is it therefore <hi>better</hi> for
me to be <hi>deceived,</hi> or not to be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These things when I Consider more
heedfully, it comes into my Mind, First,
that 'tis no cause of Admiration that <hi>God</hi>
should do Things whereof I can give no
account, nor must I therefore doubt his
<hi>Being,</hi> because there are many things
done by him, and I not comprehend
<hi>Why</hi> or <hi>How</hi> they are done; for seeing I
now know that my <hi>Nature</hi> is very <hi>Weak</hi>
and <hi>Finite,</hi> and that the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is
<hi>Immense, Incomprehensible, Infinite;</hi> from
hence I must fully, understand, that he can
do numberless things, the <hi>Causes</hi> whereof
lie <hi>hidden</hi> to Me. Upon which account
Only I esteem all those Causes which are
Drawn from the <hi>End</hi> (viz. <hi>Final Causes</hi>)
as of no use in <hi>Natural Philosophy,</hi> for
I cannot without Rashness Think my

self <hi>able</hi> to Discover <hi>Gods</hi> Designes.</p>
               <p>I perceive this also, that whenever we
endeavour to know whether the <hi>Work's</hi>
of <hi>God</hi> are <hi>perfect,</hi> we must not Respect
any <hi>one kind</hi> of Creature <hi>singly,</hi> but the
<hi>Whole Vniverse</hi> of <hi>Beings;</hi> for perhaps
what (if considered <hi>alone</hi>) may Deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
seem <hi>Imperfect,</hi> yet (as it is a <hi>part</hi> of
the <hi>World</hi>) is most <hi>perfect;</hi> and tho since
I have <hi>doubted</hi> of all things, I have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
nothing <hi>certainly</hi> to <hi>Exist,</hi> but
<hi>my self,</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> yet since I have Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
the <hi>Omnipotency</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but that many other things <hi>are made</hi>
(or at least, <hi>may be made</hi>) by him, so that
I my self <hi>may be a part</hi> of this <hi>Vniverse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, coming nigher to my self,
and enquiring what these <hi>Errors</hi> of mine,
are (which are the Only Arguments of
my <hi>Imperfection</hi>) * I find them to <hi>depend</hi> on
<hi>two concurring Causes,</hi> on my <hi>faculty</hi> of
<hi>Knowing,</hi> and on my <hi>faculty</hi> of <hi>Choosing</hi>
or <hi>Freedome</hi> of my <hi>Will,</hi> that is to say,
from my <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> and my <hi>Will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi>
For by my <hi>Vnderstanding alone</hi> I
only perceive <hi>Ideas,</hi> whereon I make
<hi>Iudgments,</hi> wherein (<hi>precisely</hi> so taken)
there can be no <hi>Error, properly</hi> so called;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99518:40"/>
for tho perhaps there may be numberless
things, whose <hi>Ideas</hi> I have <hi>not</hi> in Me, yet I
am not <hi>properly</hi> to be said <hi>Deprived</hi> of them,
but only <hi>negatively wanting</hi> them; and I
cannot prove that <hi>God ought</hi> to have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
me a <hi>greater faculty</hi> of <hi>Knowing.</hi> And
tho I understand him to be a <hi>skilful Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
yet I cannot Think, that he <hi>ought</hi> to
have put all those <hi>perfections</hi> in <hi>each</hi> Work
of his <hi>singly,</hi> with which he might have
<hi>endowed some</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>Neither can I complain that <hi>God</hi> has
not given me a <hi>Will,</hi> or <hi>Freedom</hi> of <hi>Choise,
large</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> enough; for I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
that 'tis <hi>Circumscribed</hi> by <hi>no
Bounds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And 'tis worth our taking notice, that
I have no other thing in me so <hi>perfect</hi> and
so <hi>Great,</hi> but I Understand that there may
be <hi>Perfecter</hi> and <hi>Greater,</hi> for if (for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
I consider the <hi>Faculty</hi> of <hi>Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
I presently preceive that in me 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>small</hi> and <hi>Finite,</hi> and also at the same
time I form to my self an <hi>Idea</hi> of an other
<hi>Vnderstanding</hi> not only <hi>much Greater,</hi> but
the <hi>Greatest</hi> and <hi>Infinite,</hi> which I perceive
to belong to <hi>God.</hi> In the same manner if
enquire into <hi>memory</hi> or <hi>imagination,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99518:41"/>
other faculties, I find them in my self
<hi>Weak</hi> and <hi>Circumscribed,</hi> but in <hi>God</hi> I Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
them to be <hi>Infinite,</hi> there is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
only my <hi>Will</hi> or <hi>Freedome</hi> of <hi>Choice,</hi>
which I find to be <hi>so Great,</hi> that I cannot
frame to my self an <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>One Greater,</hi>
so that 'tis by this <hi>chiefly</hi> by which I Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
my self to <hi>Bear</hi> the <hi>likeness</hi> and <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi>
of <hi>God.</hi> For tho the <hi>Will</hi> in <hi>God</hi>
be without comparison <hi>Greater</hi> then Mine,
both as to the <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> which
are <hi>Ioyn'd</hi> therewith, which make it more
<hi>strong</hi> and <hi>Effective,</hi> and also as to the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>
thereof, for <hi>God</hi> can apply himself to
<hi>more</hi> things then I can. Yet being taken
<hi>Formally</hi> and <hi>Precisely Gods Will</hi> seems <hi>no
greater</hi> then Mine. For the <hi>Freedome</hi> of
<hi>Will</hi> consists only in this, that we can <hi>Do,</hi>
or <hi>not Do</hi> such a Thing (that is, <hi>affirm</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
prosecute</hi> or <hi>avoid</hi>) or rather in this Only,
that we are <hi>so carried</hi> to a Thing which is
<hi>proposed</hi> by Our <hi>Intellect</hi> to <hi>Affirm</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
Prosecute</hi> or <hi>Shun,</hi> that we are <hi>sensible,</hi>
that we are <hi>not Determin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or <hi>Aversion</hi> thereof, by any <hi>outward Force.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is it Requisite to make one <hi>Free</hi>
that he should have an <hi>Inclination</hi> to <hi>both</hi>
sides. For on the contrary, by how much
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99518:41"/>
the more <hi>strongly</hi> I am inclined to <hi>one</hi> side
(whether it be that I <hi>evidently perceive</hi>
therein Good or Evil, or Whether it be
that <hi>God has so disposed</hi> my <hi>Inward Thoughts</hi>)
By so much the <hi>more Free</hi> am I in my
<hi>Choice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither truly do <hi>Gods Grace</hi> or <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Knowledge</hi> take away from my <hi>Liberty,</hi>
but rather <hi>encrease</hi> and <hi>strengthen</hi> it. For
that <hi>indifference</hi> which I find in my self,
when no Reason inclines me <hi>more</hi> to <hi>one
side,</hi> then to <hi>the other,</hi> is the <hi>meanest</hi> sort of
<hi>Liberty,</hi> and is so far from being a sign of
<hi>perfection,</hi> that it only argues a <hi>defect</hi> or <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi>
of <hi>Knowledge;</hi> for if I should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<hi>Clearly see</hi> what were <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Good</hi>
I should never <hi>deliberate</hi> in my <hi>Iudgement</hi>
or <hi>Choice,</hi> and Consequently, tho I were
<hi>perfectly Free,</hi> yet I should never be <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all which, I perceive that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Willing precisely</hi> so tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
which I have from <hi>God,</hi> is the <hi>Cause</hi> of
my <hi>Errors,</hi> it being most <hi>full</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> in
its kind; Neither also the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi>
for whatever I <hi>Understand</hi>
(since 'tis from God that I <hi>Vnderstand</hi> it) I
<hi>understand aright,</hi> nor can I be therein <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:99518:42"/>From <hi>Whence</hi> therefore proceed all my
<hi>Errors?</hi> To which, I answer, that they
proceed from <hi>hence</hi> only, that seeing the
<hi>Will</hi> expatiates it self <hi>farther</hi> then the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi>
I keep it not within the <hi>same
bounds</hi> with my <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> but often
extend it to those things which I <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not,</hi> to which things it being <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi>
it easily Declines from what is <hi>True</hi>
and <hi>Good;</hi> and consequently I am <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi>
and <hi>Commit sin.</hi> * Thus, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
when lately I set my self to enquire,
Whether any thing doth <hi>Exist,</hi> and found
that from my setting <hi>my self</hi> to Examine
such a thing, it evidently follows that I <hi>my
self Exist,</hi> I could not but <hi>Iudge,</hi> what I
so <hi>clearly Vnderstood,</hi> to be <hi>true,</hi> not that I
was <hi>forced</hi> thereto by any <hi>outward impulse,</hi>
but because a <hi>strong Propension</hi> in my <hi>Will</hi>
did follow this <hi>Great Light</hi> in my <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi>
so that I believed it so much the
more <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>willingly,</hi> by how much
the less <hi>indifferent</hi> I was thereto. But
now I understand, not only, that <hi>I Exist</hi>
as I am a <hi>Thing</hi> that <hi>Thinks,</hi> but I also meet
with a certain <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Corporeal Nature,</hi>
and it so happens that I <hi>doubt,</hi> whether
that <hi>Thinking Nature</hi> that is in me be <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:99518:42"/>
from that <hi>Corporeal Nature,</hi> or Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they are <hi>both the same:</hi> but in this <hi>I</hi>
suppose that <hi>I</hi> have found no Argument
to <hi>incline</hi> me <hi>either ways,</hi> and therefore <hi>I</hi>
am <hi>Indifferent</hi> to <hi>affirm</hi> or <hi>deny either,</hi> or to
<hi>Iudge nothing</hi> of <hi>either;</hi> But this <hi>indifferency</hi>
extends it self not only to those things of
which I am <hi>clearly ignorant,</hi> but generally to
all those things which are <hi>not</hi> so very <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
known</hi> to me at the Time when my
<hi>Will Deliberates</hi> of them; for tho never so
probable <hi>Guesses incline</hi> me to <hi>one</hi> side,
yet the Knowing that they are only <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures,</hi>
and not indubitable <hi>reasons,</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to Draw my <hi>Assent</hi> to the <hi>Contrary</hi>
Part. Which Lately <hi>I</hi> have sufficiently
experienced, when <hi>I</hi> supposed all those
things (which formerly <hi>I</hi> assented to as
most <hi>True</hi>) as very <hi>False,</hi> for this <hi>Reason</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that <hi>I</hi> found my self <hi>able</hi> to doubt of
them in some manner.</p>
               <p>If I abstain from <hi>passing</hi> my <hi>Iudgment,</hi>
when I do <hi>not clearly</hi> and <hi>distinctly</hi> enough
perceive what is <hi>Truth,</hi> 'tis evident that I
do <hi>well,</hi> and that I am <hi>not deceived:</hi> But if
I <hi>affirm</hi> or <hi>deny,</hi> then 'tis that I <hi>abuse</hi> the
<hi>freedome</hi> of my <hi>will,</hi> and if I turn my self
to that part which is <hi>false,</hi> I am <hi>deceived;</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:99518:43"/>
but if I <hi>embrace</hi> the <hi>contrary</hi> Part, 'tis but <hi>by
chance</hi> that I light on the <hi>Truth,</hi> yet I shall
not therefore be Blameless, for 'tis Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
by the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> that the <hi>Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the <hi>Vnderstanding ought</hi> to preceed
the <hi>Determination</hi> of the <hi>Will.</hi> And 'tis
in this <hi>abuse</hi> of <hi>Free-Will</hi> that That <hi>Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
consists, which Constitutes <hi>Error;</hi> I
say there is a <hi>Privation</hi> in the <hi>Action</hi> as it

which I have received from <hi>God;</hi> nor in

               </p>
               <p>Neither have I any Reason to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
that God has not given me a <hi>larger

for 'tis a necessary Incident to a <hi>finite Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi>
that it should not Understand

<hi>Voluntary Actions</hi> or <hi>Iudgements</hi> in which
I am <hi>deceived:</hi> for those <hi>Acts</hi> as they <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend</hi>
on <hi>God</hi> are altogether <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Good;</hi>
and I am in some measure <hi>more perfect</hi> in
that I can <hi>so Act,</hi> then if I could <hi>not:</hi> for
that <hi>Privation,</hi> in which the <hi>Ratio Formalis</hi>
of <hi>Falshood</hi> and <hi>Sin</hi> consists, wants not the
<hi>Concourse</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> For it is <hi>not A Thing,</hi>
and having respect to him as its <hi>Cause,</hi>
ought not to be called <hi>Privation,</hi> but <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;</hi>
for certainly 'tis no <hi>Imperfection</hi> in
<hi>God,</hi> that he has given me a <hi>freedome</hi> of
<hi>Assenting</hi> or <hi>not Assenting</hi> to some things,
the <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>distinct</hi> Knowledge whereof
he has not <hi>Imparted</hi> to my <hi>Vnderstanding;</hi>
but certainly 'tis an <hi>Imperfection</hi> in me,
that I <hi>abuse</hi> this <hi>liberty,</hi> and <hi>pass</hi> my <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
on those things which I do <hi>not Rightly</hi>
Understand.</p>
               <p>Yet I see that 'tis Possible with <hi>God</hi> to
effect that (tho I should remain <hi>Free,</hi> and,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:99518:44"/>
of a <hi>Finite Knowledge</hi>) I should <hi>never Ern,</hi>
that is, if he had endowed my <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>
with a <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>distinct</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of all things whereof I should ever
have an <hi>Occasion</hi> of <hi>deliberating;</hi> or if he
had only so firmly fix'd in my Mind, that
I should never forget, this, <hi>That I must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Iudge of a thing which I do not clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and distinctly Vnderstand;</hi> Either of
which things had <hi>God</hi> done, I easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that <hi>I</hi> (as consider'd in my self)
should be <hi>more perfect</hi> then now I am, yet
nevertheless I cannot deny but that there
<hi>may be a greater perfection</hi> in the <hi>whole Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse</hi>
of Things, for that some of its parts
are Obnoxius to <hi>Errors,</hi> and some not, then
if they were all <hi>alike.</hi> And I have no
Reason to Complain, that it has pleased
God, that I should <hi>Act</hi> on the <hi>Stage</hi> of this
<hi>World</hi> a <hi>Part</hi> not the <hi>chief</hi> and <hi>most perfect</hi>
of all; Or that I should not be able to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from <hi>Error</hi> in the <hi>first way</hi> above spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifi'd,
which depends upon the <hi>Evident
Knowledge</hi> of those things whereof <hi>I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate;</hi>
Yet that I may abstain from <hi>Error</hi>
by the <hi>other means</hi> abovemention'd, which
depends only on this, <hi>That I Iudge not of
any Thing, the truth whereof is not Evident.</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:99518:44"/>
For tho I have experienced in my self this
<hi>Infirmity,</hi> that I cannot <hi>always</hi> be intent
upon <hi>me</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> Knowledge, yet <hi>I</hi>
may by a <hi>continued</hi> and <hi>often repeated</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
bring this to pass, that as often as
<hi>I</hi> have use of this Rule <hi>I</hi> may Remember
it, by which means I may Get (as it were)
an <hi>habit</hi> of <hi>not erring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which thing seeing the <hi>greatest</hi> and
<hi>chief perfection</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> consists, <hi>I</hi> repute
my self to have gain'd much by this days
<hi>Meditation,</hi> for that therein <hi>I</hi> have disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
the <hi>Cause</hi> of <hi>Error, and Falshood;</hi>
which certainly can be no other then what
<hi>I</hi> have now Declared; for whenever in
Passing my Judgement, <hi>I</hi> bridle my <hi>Will</hi>
so that it extend it self <hi>only</hi> to those things
which <hi>I clearly</hi> and <hi>distinctly</hi> perceive, it
is impossible that I can <hi>Err.</hi> For doubtles;
All <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>distinct</hi> Perception is <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
and therefore cannot <hi>proceed</hi> from
<hi>Nothing,</hi> but must necessarily have <hi>God</hi> for
its <hi>Author (God,</hi> I say, Who is <hi>infinitely Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi>

it Must be <hi>True.</hi>
               </p>

I ought to consider the <hi>Ideas</hi> of those things,

               </p>
               <p>One thing there is worthy my Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
which is, that I find in my self, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
<hi>Ideas</hi> of certain things, which

by <hi>Me,</hi> but have their own <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable
Natures.</hi> As when, for example.</p>
               <p>* I <hi>Imagine</hi> a <hi>Triangle,</hi> tho perhaps such a
<hi>Figure Exists no where</hi> out of my <hi>Thoughts,</hi>
nor ever <hi>will Exist,</hi> yet the <hi>Nature</hi> thereof
is <hi>determinate,</hi> and its <hi>Essence</hi> or Form is
<hi>Immutalle</hi> and <hi>Eternal,</hi> which is neither
<hi>made</hi> by me, nor <hi>depends</hi> on my mind, as
appears for that many <hi>properties</hi> may be

its three Angles are equal to two

it appertains to his <hi>Nature Always to Be,</hi> as I

Figure</hi> or <hi>Number</hi> belongs to the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of that <hi>Figure</hi> or <hi>Number:</hi> so that, tho all
things which I have <hi>Meditated</hi> upon these
three or four days were not <hi>true,</hi> yet I may
well be as <hi>certain</hi> of the <hi>Existence</hi> of a <hi>God,</hi> as

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doubt.</hi> Yet this Argument at first sight
appears not so <hi>evident,</hi> but looks rather
like a <hi>sophism;</hi> for seeing I am used in all
other things to <hi>Distinguish Existence</hi> from
<hi>Essence,</hi> I can easily perswade my self that
the <hi>Existence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> may be <hi>distinguish'd</hi>
from his <hi>Essence,</hi> so that I may <hi>Imagine God</hi>
not to <hi>Exist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solution.</hi> But considering it more strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
'tis manifest, that the <hi>Existence</hi> of <hi>God</hi>
can no more be <hi>seperated</hi> from his <hi>Essence,</hi>
then the <hi>Equality</hi> of the <hi>Three Angles</hi> to <hi>two
right ones</hi> can be <hi>seperated</hi> from the <hi>Essence</hi>
of a <hi>Triangle,</hi> or then the <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:99518:47"/>
can be <hi>without</hi> the <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>valley;</hi> so
that 'tis no less a <hi>Repugnancy</hi> to think of
a <hi>God</hi> (that is, <hi>A Being infinitely perfect</hi>)
who wants <hi>Existence</hi> (that is, who wants a
<hi>Perfection</hi>) then to think of a <hi>Mountain,</hi>
to which there is <hi>no Valley adjoyning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doubt.</hi> But what if I cannot imagine

a Vally?</hi> yet supposing me to think of
a <hi>Mountain with a Vally,</hi> it does not from
thence follow, that there <hi>Is a Mountain</hi> in

a <hi>God</hi> as <hi>Existing,</hi> yet does it not follow
that <hi>God Really Exists.</hi> For my <hi>Thought
imposes</hi> no <hi>necessity</hi> on Things, and as I may
imagine a <hi>Winged Horse,</hi> tho no <hi>Horse</hi> has
<hi>Wings,</hi> so I may imagine an existing <hi>God,</hi>
tho no <hi>God exist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solution.</hi> 'Tis true the <hi>Sophism</hi> seems to
lie in this, yet tho I cannot conceive a
<hi>Mountain</hi> but with a <hi>Vally,</hi> it does not

<hi>Vally</hi> do <hi>Exist,</hi> but this will follow, that

I am forced to suppose <hi>God Existing,</hi> after I
have supposed him <hi>endowed</hi> with all <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi>
seeing <hi>Existence</hi> is one of them;
but that my <hi>First Position (viz. His Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute

example, 'tis not <hi>necessary</hi> for me to think
all <hi>Quadrilateral Figures</hi> inscribed in a <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle;</hi>
But supposing that I think <hi>so,</hi> I am then

               <p>
                  <hi>Solution.</hi> For tho I am not forced at any

what Figures may be <hi>inscribed</hi> within a

that all <hi>Quadrilateral Figures</hi> are of that
sort; neither can I possibly imagine this,

               <p>But whatever way of Argumentation
I use, it comes All at last to this one Thing,
That I am fully perswaded of the <hi>Truth</hi> of
those things only, which appear to me
<hi>clearly</hi> and <hi>distinctly.</hi> And tho some of
those things, which I so perceive, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to <hi>every</hi> Man, and some are only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
by Those that search more <hi>nighly;</hi>
and enquire more <hi>carefully,</hi> yet when such
<hi>truths</hi> are discover'd, they are esteem'd no
less <hi>certain</hi> than the Others. For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
Tho it do not so easily appear, that
in a Rightangled Triangle, the square of
the Base is equal to the squares of the sides,
as it appears, that the Base is subtended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
its Largest Angle, yet the <hi>first Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is no less certainly</hi> believed when once
'tis perceived, then this <hi>Last.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:99518:49"/>Thus in Reference to <hi>God;</hi> certainly,
unless I am overrun with <hi>Prejudice,</hi> or
have my thoughts begirt on all sides with
<hi>sensible Objects,</hi> I should acknowledge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>before</hi> or <hi>easier</hi> then him; For what
is more <hi>self-evident</hi> then that there is a
<hi>Chief Being,</hi> or then that a <hi>God</hi> (to whose
<hi>essence alone Existence</hi> appertains) does
<hi>Exist?</hi> And tho serious Consideration is
required to perceive thus much, yet <hi>Now,</hi>
I am not only equally <hi>certain</hi> of it, as of
what seems most <hi>certain,</hi> but I perceive al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that the <hi>Truth</hi> of other Things so <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends</hi>
on it, that without it nothing can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be <hi>perfectly known.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For tho my <hi>nature</hi> be <hi>such,</hi> that during
the time of my <hi>Clear</hi> and <hi>Distinct</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
I cannot but believe it <hi>true;</hi> yet
my <hi>Nature</hi> is <hi>such</hi> also, that I cannot fix the
<hi>Intention</hi> of my <hi>Mind</hi> upon one and the
same thing alwayes, so as to perceive it
<hi>clearly,</hi> and the Remembrance of what
<hi>Iudgement</hi> I have formerly made is often
stirred up, when I cease attending to those
reasons for which I passed such a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
other Reasons may then be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
which (if I did not <hi>know God</hi>) may
easily <hi>move</hi> me in my <hi>Opinion;</hi> and by this
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99518:50"/>
means I shall never attain to the <hi>true</hi> and
<hi>certain Knowledge</hi> of any Thing, but <hi>Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring</hi>
and <hi>Vnstable opinions.</hi> So, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
when I consider the Nature of a
Triangle, it plainly appears to me (as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
the Principles of Geometry)
that its three Angles are equal to two right
ones; And this I must of necessity think
<hi>True</hi> as long as I attend to the <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
thereof; but as soon as ever I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
my Mind from the <hi>Consideration</hi> of
its <hi>Proof</hi> (altho I remember that I have
once <hi>Clearly</hi> perceived it) yet perhaps I
may <hi>doubt</hi> of Its <hi>Truth,</hi> being as yet <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi>
of a <hi>God;</hi> For I may perswade my
self, that I am so framed by <hi>Nature,</hi> as to
be <hi>deceived</hi> in those things which I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
my self to perceive most <hi>evidently.</hi>
Especially when I recollect, that hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I have often accounted many things
<hi>True</hi> and <hi>Certain,</hi> which afterward upon
other Reasons I have Judged as False. But
when I perceive that there is a <hi>God;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
at the same time I also Understand
that all things <hi>Depend</hi> on Him, and that he
is not a <hi>Deceiver;</hi> and when from hence I
Collect that all those Things which I <hi>clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
and <hi>distinctly</hi> perceive are <hi>necessarily True;</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:99518:50"/>
tho I have no further Respects to those
Reasons which induced me to believe it
<hi>True,</hi> yet if I do but remember, that I
have <hi>once clearly</hi> and <hi>distinctly</hi> perceived it,
no Argument can be brought on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
that shall make me <hi>doubt,</hi> but that I
have <hi>true</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> Knowledge thereof;
and not onely of that, but of all other
<hi>Truths</hi> also which I remember that I have
<hi>once Demonstrated,</hi> such as are <hi>Geometrical
Propositions</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>What now can be <hi>Objected</hi> against me?
shall I say, that I am so made by <hi>Nature,</hi> as
to be often <hi>deceived?</hi> NO; For I now
Know that I cannot be <hi>deceived</hi> in those
Things, which I <hi>clearly</hi> Understand. Shall
I say, that at other times I have esteem'd
many Things <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Certain,</hi> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
I found to be <hi>falsities?</hi> No; for
I perceived none of those things <hi>clearly</hi> and
<hi>distinctly,</hi> but being Ignorant of this <hi>Rule</hi>
of <hi>Truth,</hi> I took them up for Reasons, which
Reasons I afterward found to be <hi>Weak.</hi>
What then can be said? Shall, I say, (as lately
I objected) that Perhaps I am <hi>asleep,</hi> and that
what I now think of is no more <hi>True,</hi> then
the <hi>Dreams</hi> of People <hi>asleep?</hi> But this it self
<hi>moves</hi> not my Opinion; for certainly tho'
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99518:51"/>
I were <hi>asleep,</hi> if any thing appear'd <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
to my Understanding, 'twould be
<hi>True.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Thus I Plainly see, that the <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
and <hi>Truth</hi> of all <hi>Science</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
on the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the <hi>True
God,</hi> so that before I had <hi>Known Him,</hi>
I did <hi>Know nothing;</hi> But now many
things both of <hi>God</hi> himself, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Intellectual Things,</hi> as also of <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
nature,</hi> which is the <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks,</hi>
may be <hi>Plainly Known</hi> and <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>

               <p>IT now remains that I examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any <hi>Corporeal Beings</hi> do <hi>Exist;</hi>
And already I know that (as they are the
<hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Pure Mathematicks</hi>) they <hi>May</hi>
(at least) <hi>Exist,</hi> for I <hi>clearly</hi> and <hi>distinctly</hi>
perceive them; and doubtless <hi>God</hi> is <hi>able</hi>
to <hi>make,</hi> whatever I am <hi>able</hi> to <hi>perceive,</hi> and
I never Judged any thing to be <hi>beyond</hi> his
<hi>Power,</hi> but what was <hi>Repugnant</hi> to a <hi>distinct
perception.</hi> Moreover, such <hi>Material Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
seem</hi> to <hi>Exist</hi> from the <hi>faculty</hi> of <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,</hi>
which I find my self make use
of, when I am conversant about them: for
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99518:52"/>
if I attentively Consider what <hi>Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
is, 'twill appear to be only <hi>a certain Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of our Cognoscitive or knowing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to a Body or Object that is before it;</hi>
and if it be <hi>before it,</hi> It must <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that this may be made more <hi>Plain,</hi>
I must first examine the <hi>difference</hi> between
<hi>Imagination,</hi> and <hi>pure Intellection,</hi> or <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</hi>
So, for example, when I <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine</hi>
a Triangle, I do not only <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand</hi>
that it is a <hi>figure comprehended</hi> by
<hi>three Line<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> but I also <hi>behold</hi> with the
<hi>eye</hi> of my <hi>mind</hi> those <hi>three lines</hi> as it were
<hi>before Me,</hi> and this is that which I call <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</hi>
But if I convert my Thoughts
to a <hi>Chiliogone,</hi> or <hi>Figure consisting</hi> of a
<hi>Thousand Angles,</hi> I know as well that this
Is a <hi>figure comprehended</hi> by a <hi>Thousand sides,</hi>
as I know that a <hi>Triangle</hi> is a <hi>Figure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting</hi>
of <hi>three sides;</hi> but I do not in the
same Manner <hi>Imagine,</hi> or <hi>behold</hi> as <hi>present</hi>
those <hi>thousand sides,</hi> as I do the <hi>three sides</hi>
of a <hi>Triangle.</hi> And tho at the time when
I so think of a <hi>Chiliogone,</hi> I may <hi>confusedly</hi>
represent to my self some <hi>Figure</hi> (because
whenever I Think of a <hi>Corporeal Object,</hi>
I am used to <hi>Imagine</hi> some <hi>Shape</hi> or other)
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99518:52"/>
yet 'tis evident that this <hi>Representation</hi> is
not a <hi>Chiliogone,</hi> because 'tis in nothing <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi>
from what I should Represent to my
self if I thought of a <hi>Milion-angled figure,</hi>
or any other Figure of <hi>More sides;</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
does such a <hi>Confused Representation</hi>
help me in the least to know those <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
by which a <hi>Chiliogone</hi> differs from O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Polygones</hi> or <hi>Manyangled Figures.</hi> But
if a Question be put concerning a <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone,</hi>
I know I may <hi>Vnderstand its Shape,</hi>
as I <hi>Vnderstand</hi> the <hi>Shape,</hi> of a <hi>Chiliogone,</hi>
without the help of <hi>Imagination,</hi> but I can
also <hi>imagine</hi> it, by applying the <hi>Eye</hi> of my
<hi>Mind</hi> to its <hi>Fives sides,</hi> and to the <hi>Area</hi> or
<hi>space</hi> contained by Them; And herein I
manifestly perceive that there is required
a <hi>peculiar sort of Operation</hi> in the <hi>Mind</hi> to
<hi>imagine</hi> a Thing, which I require not to
<hi>Vnderstand</hi> a Thing; which <hi>New Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of the <hi>Mind</hi> plainly shews the <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
between <hi>imagination</hi> and <hi>pure Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides this, I Consider that this <hi>Power</hi>
of <hi>Imagination</hi> which is in me (as it differs
from the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Vnderstanding</hi>) does
not appertian to the <hi>Essence</hi> of <hi>Me,</hi> that
is, of <hi>my mind,</hi> for tho I <hi>wanted</hi> it, yet
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99518:53"/>
certainly I should be the <hi>same He, that</hi> now
<hi>I am:</hi> from whence it seems to follow,
that it depends on something <hi>different</hi> from
<hi>my self;</hi> and I easily perceive that if any <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
whatever did <hi>Exist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> to which my <hi>Mind</hi>
were so <hi>conjoyn'd,</hi> that it may Apply it self
when it pleased to <hi>Consider,</hi> or (as it were)
<hi>Look</hi> into <hi>this Body;</hi> From hence, I say,
I perceive <hi>It may so be,</hi> that by this very
<hi>Body</hi> I may <hi>Imagine Corporeal Beings:</hi> So
that this <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>Thinking</hi> differs from
<hi>pure Intellection</hi> only in this, that the <hi>Mind,</hi>
when it <hi>Vnderstands,</hi> does as it were turn
<hi>it self,</hi> to <hi>it self,</hi> or <hi>Reflect</hi> on it self, and
<hi>be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>o'ds</hi> some or other of those <hi>Ideas</hi> which
are in it self; But when it <hi>Imagines,</hi> it <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts</hi>
it self upon <hi>Body,</hi> and therein <hi>beholds</hi>
something Conformable to that <hi>Idea,</hi>
which it hath <hi>understood,</hi> or <hi>perceived by
Sense.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But 'tis to remembred, that I said, I ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
conceive Imagination <hi>May be</hi> so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
supposing <hi>Body</hi> to <hi>Exist.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
no so convenient manner of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
it offers it self, from thence I <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably</hi>
guess, that <hi>Body</hi> does <hi>Exist.</hi> But
this I only say <hi>probably,</hi> for tho I should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately
search into all the Argument<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:99518:53"/>
drawn from the <hi>distinct</hi> Idea of <hi>Body,</hi>
which I find in my <hi>Imagination,</hi> yet I find
none of them, from whence I may <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi>
conclude, <hi>that Body does Exist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I have been accustomed to <hi>Imagine</hi>
many other things besides that <hi>Corporeal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
which is the <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>pure Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi>
such as are, <hi>Colours, Sounds, Tasts,
Pain,</hi> &amp;c. but none of these so <hi>distinctly.</hi>
And because I perceive these better by
<hi>Sense,</hi> from Which by the Help of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory</hi>
they come to the <hi>Imagination,</hi> that I
may with the Greater advantage treat of
them, I ought at the same time to Consider
<hi>Sence,</hi> and to try whether from what I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
by that way of <hi>Thought,</hi> which I call
<hi>Sense,</hi> I can deduce any certain Argument
for the <hi>Existence</hi> of <hi>Corporeal Beings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And first I will here reflect with my
self, what those things were, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perceived by <hi>Sence</hi> I have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thought <hi>True,</hi> and the <hi>Reasons</hi> why
I <hi>so thought:</hi> I will, then enquire into
the <hi>Reasons</hi> for which I afterwards <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
those things. And last of all I will
consider what I <hi>ought</hi> to <hi>think</hi> of those
Things at <hi>Present.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First therefore I have always thought
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99518:54"/>
that I have had an <hi>Head, H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which <hi>This Body</hi> (which I have
look'd upon as a <hi>Part</hi> of <hi>Me,</hi>
or Perhaps as my <hi>Whole self</hi>) Consists;
And I have also thought that this <hi>Body</hi> of
<hi>Mine</hi> is Conversant or engaged among
many <hi>Other Bodies,</hi> by which it is Liable to
be <hi>affected</hi> with what is <hi>advantagious</hi> or
<hi>hurtful;</hi> What was <hi>Advantagious</hi> I judged
by a certain <hi>sense</hi> of <hi>Pleasure,</hi> what was
<hi>Hurtful</hi> by a <hi>sense</hi> of <hi>Pain.</hi> Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
besides <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Pain,</hi> I perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in my self <hi>Hunger, Thirst,</hi> and other
such like <hi>Appetites,</hi> as also certain <hi>Corporeal

other like <hi>Passions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to What hapned to me from <hi>Bodies
without,</hi> Besides the <hi>Extension, Figure,</hi> and
<hi>Motion</hi> of those <hi>Bodies,</hi> I also perceived in
them <hi>Hardness, Heat,</hi> and other <hi>tactile
Qualities,</hi> as also <hi>Light, Colours, Smells,

these I <hi>distinguish'd</hi> the <hi>Heaven, Earth,</hi>

other.</p>
               <p>Neither was it wholly without Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
(upon the account of these <hi>Ideas</hi> of

                  <hi>Qualities,</hi> which offer'd themselves to my

fro whence these <hi>Ideas</hi> might <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed;</hi>
for I often found these <hi>Ideas</hi> come
upon me without my <hi>Consent</hi> or <hi>Will;</hi> so
that I can neither perceive an <hi>Object (th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

my self from perceiving it, when it is
<hi>Present.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And seeing that those <hi>Ideas</hi> which I take
in by sense are much more <hi>Lively, Apparent</hi>
and in their kind more <hi>distinct,</hi> than any of
those which <hi>I knowingly</hi> and <hi>Willingly</hi> frame
by Meditation, or stir up in my <hi>Memory;</hi> it
seems to me that they cannot proceed
from <hi>my self.</hi> There remains therefore
no other way for them to come upon me,
but from some other Things <hi>Without</hi> Me.
Of Which Things seeing <hi>I</hi> have no other
Knowledge but from these <hi>Ideas, I</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Think but that these <hi>Ideas</hi> are <hi>like</hi> the
Things.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Because <hi>I</hi> remember that <hi>I</hi>
first made use of my <hi>senses</hi> before my <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:99518:55"/>
and because <hi>I</hi> did perceive that
those <hi>Ideas</hi> which <hi>I</hi> my self did frame
were not so <hi>Manifest</hi> as those which <hi>I</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by my <hi>senses,</hi> but very often <hi>made

<hi>judgments</hi> that I made of <hi>sensible objects,</hi>
I seem'd to be taught by <hi>Nature,</hi> for I first
perswaded my self that things were <hi>so</hi>

and in numberless other things, I perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>judgements</hi> of my <hi>outward senses</hi>
were <hi>deceived:</hi> and not of my <hi>outward</hi>
only, but of my <hi>inward senses</hi> also; for
what is more <hi>intimate</hi> or <hi>inward</hi> than
<hi>Pain?</hi> And yet I have heard from those,
whose Arm or Leg was cut off, that they
have felt <hi>pain</hi> in that part which they
<hi>wanted,</hi> and therefore I am not <hi>absolutely
certain</hi> that any part of me is affected
with <hi>pain,</hi> tho I <hi>feel pain</hi> therein. To
these I have lately added two
very <hi>general Reasons of doubt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Medit. 1.</note>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:99518:56"/>
The first was, that while I was <hi>awake,</hi> I
could not believe my self to perceive any
thing, which I could not think my self
sometimes to perceive, tho I were <hi>a sleep;</hi>
And seeing I cannot believe, that what I
seem to perceive in my <hi>sleep</hi> proceeds
from <hi>outward Objects,</hi> what greater Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
have I to think so of what I perceive
whilst I am <hi>awake?</hi> The other Cause of
Doubt was, that seeing I know not the
<hi>Author</hi> of my <hi>Being</hi> (or at least I then <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed</hi>
my self not to know him) what
reason is there but that I may be so order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Nature</hi> as to be <hi>deceived</hi> even in
those things which appear'd to me most
<hi>true.</hi> And as to the <hi>Reasons,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
me to give <hi>credit to sensible</hi> Things,
'twas easie to return an answer thereto, for
finding by experience, that I was impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by <hi>Nature</hi> to many Things, which
<hi>Reason</hi> disswaded me from, I thought I
should not far trust what I was taught by
<hi>Nature.</hi> And tho the perceptions of my
<hi>senses</hi> depended not on my <hi>Will,</hi> I thought
<hi>I</hi> should not therefore conclude, that
they proceeded from <hi>Objects different</hi> from
my self; for perhaps there may be some
other <hi>Faculty</hi> in me (tho as yet <hi>unknown</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:99518:56"/>
to me) which might frame those <hi>percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now that I begin bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to know <hi>my self</hi> and the
Author of my <hi>Original,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How far the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are now to be trusted.</note> 
                  <hi>I</hi>
do not think, that all things, which I
seem to have from my <hi>senses</hi> are <hi>rashly</hi> to
be <hi>admitted,</hi> neither are all things so <hi>had,</hi>
to be <hi>doubted.</hi> And first because I know
that whatever I <hi>clearly</hi> and <hi>distinctly</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<hi>may be</hi> so made by <hi>God</hi> as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them; the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>understanding
clearly</hi> and <hi>distinctly</hi> one Thing <hi>without</hi> the
other is sufficient to make Me <hi>certain</hi> that
One Thing is <hi>different</hi> from the Other;
because it <hi>may</hi> at least be placed apart by
<hi>God,</hi> and that it may be esteem'd <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi>
it matters not by what <hi>Power</hi> it <hi>may</hi>
be so <hi>sever'd.</hi> And therefore from the
knowledge I have, that <hi>I my self exist,</hi>
and because at the same time I understand
that nothing else appertains to my <hi>Nature</hi>
or <hi>Essence,</hi> but that I am a <hi>thinking Being,</hi>
I rightly conclude, that my <hi>Essence</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in this alone, that I am a <hi>thinking Thing.</hi>
And tho <hi>perhaps</hi> (or, as I shall shew pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,
'tis <hi>certain</hi>) I have a <hi>Body</hi> which
is very <hi>nighly</hi> conjoyned to me, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99518:57"/>
on this side I have a clear and <hi>distinct
Idea</hi> of my self, as I am only a <hi>thinking Thing,

I have a <hi>distinct Idea</hi> of my <hi>Body,</hi> as

'tis from hence <hi>certain,</hi> that I <hi>am really

               <p>Moreover I find in my self some <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

endow'd with <hi>certain</hi> peculiar waies

the <hi>Faculty</hi> of <hi>Perception</hi> or <hi>sense;</hi>
without which <hi>I</hi> can conceive my <hi>whole

without <hi>conceiving My self,</hi> that is, an
<hi>understanding substance</hi> in which they are;
for none of them in their <hi>formal Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
includes <hi>understanding;</hi> from whence
<hi>I</hi> perceive they are as <hi>different</hi> from <hi>me,</hi>
as the <hi>modus</hi> or <hi>manner</hi> of a Thing is <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi>
from the <hi>Thing it self.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> acknowledge also, that <hi>I</hi> have seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
other <hi>Faculties,</hi> such as <hi>changing</hi> of
<hi>place, putting on various shapes,</hi> &amp;c. Which
can no more be understood without a
<hi>substance</hi> in which they are, then the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
<hi>Faculties,</hi> and consequently
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99518:57"/>
they can no more be understood to <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist</hi>
without that <hi>substance:</hi> But yet 'tis Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that this sort of <hi>Faculties,</hi> to the
End they may exist, ought to be in a <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal,
Extended,</hi> and not in a <hi>Vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
substance,</hi> because <hi>Extension,</hi> and not
<hi>Intellection</hi> or <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the <hi>Clear</hi> and <hi>Distinct conception</hi> of
them.</p>
               <p>But there is also in me a certain <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Faculty</hi> of <hi>sense,</hi> or of <hi>Receiving</hi> and
<hi>Knowing</hi> the <hi>Ideas</hi> of <hi>sensible Things;</hi> of
which <hi>Faculty</hi> I can make no use, unless
there were in my self, or in something
else, a certain <hi>Active Faculty</hi> of <hi>Producing</hi>
and <hi>Effecting</hi> those <hi>Ideas.</hi> But this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be in my self, for it Pre-supposes no
<hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> and those <hi>Ideas</hi> are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in me, tho I help not, and often a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
my <hi>Will.</hi> There remains therefore
no Place for this <hi>Active Faculty,</hi> but that
it should be in some <hi>substance different</hi> from
me. In which because all the <hi>Reallity,</hi>
which is contain'd <hi>Objectively</hi> in the <hi>Ideas</hi>
Produced by that <hi>Faculty,</hi> ought to be
contain'd <hi>Formally</hi> or <hi>Eminently</hi> (as I have
Formerly taken notice) this <hi>substance</hi> must
be either <hi>a Body</hi> (in which what is in the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99518:58"/>
                  <hi>Ideas Objectively</hi> is contain'd <hi>Formally</hi>) or
it Must Be <hi>God,</hi> or some <hi>Creature</hi> more <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent</hi>
then a <hi>Body</hi> (In which what is in
the <hi>Ideas Objectively</hi> is contain'd <hi>Eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>)
But seeing that <hi>God</hi> is not a <hi>Deceivour,</hi>
'tis altogether Manifest, that <hi>he</hi> does not
Place these <hi>Ideas</hi> in me either <hi>Immediately</hi>
from himself, or <hi>Mediately</hi> from any other
Creature, wherein their <hi>Objective Reallity</hi>
is not * contain'd <hi>Formally,</hi> but only <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently.</hi>
And seeing <hi>God</hi> has given me
no <hi>Faculty</hi> to discern Whether these I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas
proceed from <hi>Corporeal</hi> or <hi>Incorporeal
Beings,</hi> but rather a <hi>strong Inclination</hi> to
believe that they are sent from <hi>Corporeal
Beings,</hi> there is no Reason Why God
should not be counted a <hi>Deceiver,</hi> if these
<hi>Ideas</hi> came from any Where, but from <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Things.</hi> Therefore we must conclude
that there are <hi>Corporeal Beings.</hi> Which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
are not all the same as I comprehend
them by <hi>my sense</hi> (for Perception by sense is
in many Things very <hi>Obscure</hi> and <hi>Confused</hi>)
but those things at least, which I <hi>clearly</hi> and
<hi>distinctly</hi> Understand, that is to say, all
those things which are comprehended
under the <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Pure Mathematicks;</hi>
those things I say at least are <hi>True.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:99518:58"/>As to What Remains, They are either
some <hi>Particulars,</hi> as that the Sun is of such
a <hi>Bigness</hi> or <hi>Shape, &amp;c.</hi> or they are Things
less <hi>Clearly</hi> Understood, as <hi>Light, Sound,
Pain,</hi> &amp;c. And tho these and such like Things
may be very <hi>Doubtful</hi> and <hi>Vncertain,</hi> yet
because <hi>God</hi> is not a <hi>Deceiver,</hi> and because
that (Therefore) none of my Opinions
can be <hi>false</hi> unless God has Given me some
<hi>Faculty</hi> or other to <hi>Correct</hi> my <hi>Error,</hi> hence
'tis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I am incouraged with the Hopes of
attaining <hi>Truth</hi> even in these very Things.</p>
               <p>And certainly it cannot be doubted but
whatever <hi>I</hi> am taught by <hi>Nature</hi> has some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
therein of <hi>Truth</hi> By <hi>Nature</hi> in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
I understand either <hi>God</hi> himself, or the

By my <hi>Own Nature</hi> in <hi>Particular</hi> I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the <hi>Complexion</hi> or <hi>Association</hi> of all
those things which are given me by God.</p>
               <p>Now there is nothing that this <hi>my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
teaches me more <hi>expresly</hi> then that I
have a <hi>Body,</hi> Which is not <hi>Well</hi> when I
<hi>feel Pain,</hi> that this <hi>Body</hi> wants <hi>Meat</hi> or
<hi>Drink</hi> When I am <hi>Hungry</hi> or <hi>Dry, &amp;c.</hi> And
therefore I ought not to Doubt but that
these things are <hi>True.</hi> And by this <hi>sense</hi> of
<hi>Pain, Hunger, Thirst,</hi> &amp;c. My <hi>Nature</hi> tells
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:99518:59"/>
me that <hi>I</hi> am not in my <hi>Body,</hi> as a <hi>Mariner</hi>
is in his <hi>Ship,</hi> but that I am most <hi>nighly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd</hi>
thereto, and as it were <hi>Blended
therewith;</hi> so that <hi>I</hi> with <hi>It</hi> make up <hi>one</hi>
thing; For Otherwise, when the <hi>Body</hi>
were hurt, <hi>I,</hi> who am only a <hi>Thinking
Thing,</hi> should not therefore <hi>feel</hi> Pain, but
should only <hi>perceive</hi> the Hurt with the
<hi>Eye</hi> of my <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> (as a <hi>Mariner
perceives</hi> by his <hi>sight</hi> whatever is broken
in his Ship) and when the <hi>Body</hi> wants ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Meat or Drink, I should only <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand</hi>
this want, but should not have
the <hi>Confused sense of Hunger</hi> or <hi>Thirst;</hi> I
call them <hi>Confused,</hi> for certainly the <hi>Sense</hi>
of <hi>Thirst, Hunger, Pain,</hi> &amp;c. are only <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
Modes</hi> or <hi>Manners</hi> of <hi>Thought</hi> arising
from the <hi>Vnion</hi> and (as it were) <hi>mixture</hi> of
the <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am taught also by <hi>Nature,</hi> that there
are many other <hi>Bodies Without</hi> and <hi>About</hi>
my <hi>Body,</hi> some whereof are to be <hi>desired,</hi>
others are to be <hi>Avoided.</hi> And because
that I Perceive very Different <hi>Colours,
Sounds, Smells, Tasts, Heat, Hardness,</hi> and
the Like, from thence I Rightly conclude
that there are <hi>Correspondent Differences</hi> in
<hi>Bodies,</hi> from which these <hi>different percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:99518:59"/>
of <hi>sense</hi> proceed, tho perhaps not <hi>Alike.</hi>
And because that some of these <hi>percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
are <hi>Pleasant,</hi> others <hi>Vnpleasant,</hi> 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
<hi>certain,</hi> that my <hi>Body,</hi> or rather
my <hi>Whole self</hi> as (<hi>I</hi> am compounded of a
<hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Body</hi>) am liable to be <hi>Affected</hi>
by these <hi>Bodies</hi> which encompass me about.</p>
               <p>There are many Other Things Also
which <hi>Nature</hi> seems to teach Me, but <hi>Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
I am not taught by It, but have gotten
them by an <hi>ill use</hi> of Passing my Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>Inconsiderately,</hi> and from hence it is
that these things happen often to be <hi>false;</hi>
as that all <hi>space</hi> is <hi>Empty,</hi> in which I find
<hi>nothing</hi> that <hi>works</hi> upon my <hi>Senses;</hi> That
in a <hi>hot Body</hi> there is something <hi>like</hi> the <hi>Idea</hi>
of <hi>Heat</hi> which is in me; That in a <hi>White</hi>
or <hi>Green</hi> Body there is the same <hi>Whiteness</hi>
or <hi>Greenness</hi> which I <hi>perceive;</hi> And the
same <hi>Taste</hi> in a <hi>bitter</hi> or <hi>sweet</hi> Thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
That <hi>Stars, Castles,</hi> and Other <hi>Remote Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
are of the same <hi>Bigness</hi> and <hi>Shape,</hi>
as they are <hi>Represented</hi> to my <hi>senses:</hi> and
such like. But that I may not admit of
any Thing in this very matter, which I
cannot <hi>Distinctly</hi> perceive, it behoves me
here to determine more <hi>Accurately</hi> What I
mean when I say, <hi>That I am taught a Thing
by Nature.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:99518:60"/>Here I take <hi>Nature</hi> more <hi>strictly,</hi> then
for the <hi>Complication</hi> of all those Things
which are Given me by <hi>God;</hi> For in this
<hi>Complication</hi> there are many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
which relate to the <hi>Mind alone,</hi> as,
That I perceive What is <hi>done</hi> cannot be <hi>not
Done,</hi> and all Other things which are
known by the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> but of
these I speak not at present. There are
also many Other Things which belong <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
to the <hi>Body,</hi> as, That it <hi>tends Downwards</hi>
and such like, of these also I treat not at
Present. But I speak of those Things
only which <hi>God</hi> hath bestowed upon me
as I am <hi>Compounded</hi> of a <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Body
together,</hi> and not <hi>differently Consider'd. 'Tis
Nature</hi> therefore thus taken that teaches
me to <hi>avoid troublesome Objects,</hi> and <hi>seek</hi>
after <hi>pleasing Ones;</hi> but it appears not

a diligent examination of <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

of <hi>Things</hi> belongs not to the <hi>Whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum</hi>

               </p>
               <p>So that tho a <hi>star affect</hi> my eye no <hi>more</hi>

then a <hi>small spark</hi> of Fire, yet there is in

<hi>believe</hi> One no bigger then the Other, but
thus I have been used to Judge from my
Childhood without any Reason: and tho
coming nigh the Fire I feel Heat, and
Coming too nigh I feel Pain, yet there is
no Reason to perswade me, That in the
Fire there is any thing <hi>like</hi> either that
Heat or that Pain, but only that there is
something therein, Whatever it be, that
excites in us those <hi>sensations</hi> of Heat or
Pain: and so tho in some space there
may be nothing that Works on my <hi>senses,</hi>
it does not from thence follow, that there
is no <hi>Body</hi> there; for I see that in these

the Order of Nature, because I use
these <hi>perceptions</hi> of <hi>sense</hi> (which properly

which will certainly prove Hurtful to
them. To this it may perhaps be reply'd,
That they <hi>Err</hi> in this because their <hi>Nature</hi>
is <hi>Corrupt.</hi> But this Answers not the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:99518:61"/>
For a sick man is no less <hi>Gods Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
then a Man in Health, and therefore
'tis as Absurd to Imagine a <hi>Deceitful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
imposed by <hi>God</hi> on the One as on the
Other; And as a Clock that is made up
of Wheels and Weights does no less strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
observe the <hi>Laws</hi> of its <hi>Nature,</hi> when
it is <hi>ill</hi> contrived, and tells the hours <hi>falsly,</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> when it answers the Desire of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer
in all performances; so if I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the body of a Man as a meer <hi>Machine</hi>
or <hi>Movement,</hi> made up and compounded
of <hi>Bones, Nerves, Muscles, Veins, Blood,</hi> and
<hi>Skin;</hi> so that, tho there were no <hi>mind</hi> in
It, yet It would perform all those Motions
which now are in it (those only excepted
which Proceed from the <hi>Will,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
from the <hi>Mind</hi>) I do easily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that it would be as <hi>natural</hi> for
him (if for example sake he were sick of
a <hi>Dropsie</hi>) to suffer that <hi>Driness</hi> of his
<hi>Throat</hi> which uses to bring into his mind
the <hi>sense of Thirst,</hi> &amp; that thereby his Nerves
and other Parts would be so disposed as to
take Drink, by Which his disease would
be encreased; As (supposing him to be
troubled with no such Distemper) by the
like Driness of Throat he would be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99518:62"/>
to Drink, when 'tis Requisite.
And tho, if I respect the Intended use
of a Clock I may say that it <hi>Errs</hi> from its
<hi>Nature,</hi> when it tells the Hours <hi>wrong,</hi> and
so considering the <hi>Movement</hi> of a <hi>Mans Body</hi>
as contrived for such <hi>Motions</hi> as are used
to be performed thereby, I may think That
also to <hi>Err</hi> from its <hi>Nature,</hi> if its <hi>Throat</hi> is
<hi>Dry,</hi> when it has no want of Drink for
its <hi>Preservation.</hi> Yet I Plainly discover,
that this last <hi>Acceptation of Nature</hi> differs
much from that whereof we have been
speaking all this While, for this is only a
<hi>Denomination extrinsick</hi> to the Things
whereof 'tis spoken, and <hi>depending</hi> on my
<hi>Thought,</hi> while it <hi>Compares</hi> a <hi>sick</hi> man, and
a <hi>disorderly</hi> Clock with the <hi>Idea</hi> of an
<hi>healthy</hi> man and a <hi>Rectified</hi> Clock. But by
<hi>Nature</hi> in its former <hi>Acceptation</hi> I Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
something that is <hi>Really</hi> in the <hi>Things</hi>
themselves, which therefore has something
of <hi>Truth</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>But tho Respecting only a <hi>Body sick</hi> of
a Dropsie it be an <hi>Extrinsick Denomination</hi>
to say, that its <hi>Nature</hi> is <hi>Corrupt,</hi> because it
has a <hi>Dry Throat,</hi> and stands in <hi>no need</hi> of
Drink; yet respecting the <hi>Whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound</hi>
or <hi>Mind joyn'd</hi> to such a <hi>Body,</hi> 'tis
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:99518:62"/>
not a <hi>meer Denomination,</hi> but a <hi>real Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi>
or <hi>Nature</hi> for it to <hi>thirst</hi> when <hi>drink</hi>
is <hi>hurtful</hi> to it. It remains therefore here
to be inquired, how the <hi>Goodness</hi> of <hi>God</hi>
suffers <hi>Nature so taken</hi> to be <hi>deceivable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore I understand that a
<hi>chief difference</hi> between my <hi>Mind</hi> and
<hi>Body</hi> consists in this, That my <hi>Body</hi> is of
its <hi>Nature divisible,</hi> but my <hi>Mind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible;</hi>
for while I consider my <hi>Mind</hi>
or <hi>my self,</hi> as I am only a <hi>thinking Thing,</hi>
I can distinguish <hi>no parts</hi> in Me, but I
perceive my self to be but <hi>one entire</hi>
Thing; and tho the <hi>whole Mind</hi> seems
to be <hi>united</hi> to the <hi>whole Body,</hi> yet a Foot,
an Arm, or any other part of the Body
being cut off, I do not therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any <hi>part</hi> of my <hi>Mind</hi> taken away;
Neither can its <hi>Faculties</hi> of <hi>desiring, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
understanding,</hi> &amp;c. be called its
<hi>Parts,</hi> for tis one and the <hi>same, mind,</hi> that
<hi>desires,</hi> that <hi>perceives,</hi> that <hi>understands;</hi>
Contrarily, I cannot think of any <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real</hi>
or <hi>extended Being,</hi> which I cannot
easily <hi>divide</hi> into <hi>Parts</hi> by my thought,
and by this I understand it to be <hi>divisible.</hi>
And this alone (if I had known it from
no other Argument) is sufficient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99518:63"/>
form me, that my <hi>mind</hi> is <hi>really distinct</hi>
from my <hi>Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nextly I find, that my <hi>mind</hi> is not <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
affected</hi> by all parts of my <hi>body,</hi>
but only by the <hi>Brain,</hi> and perhaps on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by one small part of it, That, to wit,
wherein the <hi>common sense</hi> is said to reside;
Which part, as often as it is disposed in
the <hi>same manner,</hi> will represent to the
<hi>mind</hi> the <hi>same thing,</hi> tho at the same time
the other parts of the <hi>body</hi> may be <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently</hi>
order'd. And this is proved by
numberless Experiments, which need not
here be related.</p>
               <p>Moreover I discover that the <hi>nature</hi> of
my <hi>body</hi> is such, that no part of it can
be <hi>moved</hi> by an other <hi>remote</hi> part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
but it may also be <hi>moved</hi> in the <hi>same
manner</hi> by some of the <hi>interjacent</hi> parts,
tho the more <hi>remote</hi> part lay still and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not; As for example in the rope,</p>
               <p>A—B—C—D</p>
               <p>if its end D. were drawn, the end A.
would be moved no otherwise, than if
one of the intermediate parts B. or C.
were drawn, and the end D. rest quiet.
So when I feel <hi>pain</hi> in my <hi>Foot,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of Physicks instructs me, that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99518:63"/>
this is performed by the help of <hi>Nerves</hi>
dispersed through the Foot, which from
thence being <hi>continued</hi> like Ropes to the
very Brain, whilst they are <hi>drawn</hi> in the
Foot, they also <hi>draw</hi> the inward parts of
the Brain to which they reach, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
excite a certain <hi>motion,</hi> which is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
by <hi>Nature</hi> to affect the <hi>mind</hi> with
a <hi>sense</hi> of <hi>Pain,</hi> as being in the <hi>Foot.</hi> But
because these Nerves must pass through the
<hi>Shin,</hi> the <hi>Thighs,</hi> the <hi>Loins,</hi> the <hi>Back,</hi> the
<hi>Neck,</hi> before they can reach the <hi>Brain</hi>
from the <hi>Foot,</hi> it may so happen, that tho
<hi>that part</hi> of them, which is in the Foot
were not touch'd, but only some of their
<hi>intermediate parts,</hi> yet the same <hi>motion,</hi>
would be caused in the <hi>Brain,</hi> as when
the <hi>Foot</hi> it self is <hi>ill affected,</hi> from whence
'twil necessarily follow, that the <hi>mind</hi>
should <hi>perceive</hi> the same <hi>Pain.</hi> And thus
may we think of any other <hi>Sense.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I understand lastly, that seeing each
single motion perform'd in that part of
the <hi>Brain,</hi> which <hi>immediately affects</hi> the
<hi>mind,</hi> excites therein only one sort of
<hi>sense<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> nothing could be contrived more
conveniently in this case, than that, of
all those <hi>Senses</hi> which it can cause, it
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99518:64"/>
should cause that which <hi>cheifly,</hi> and most
<hi>frequently</hi> conduces to the <hi>conservation</hi> of
an <hi>healthful Man;</hi> And experience wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
that to this very <hi>end</hi> all our <hi>senses</hi>
are given us by <hi>Nature;</hi> and therefore
nothing can be found therein, which does
not abundantly testifie the <hi>Power</hi> and
<hi>Goodness</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Thus for Example,
when the Nerves of the Feet are violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and more than ordinarily moved, that
motion of them being propagated through
the <hi>Medulla Spinalis</hi> of the Back to the
inward parts of the Brain, there it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
to the mind, that something or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is to be felt, and what is this but
Pain, as if it were in the Foot, by which
the Mind is excited to use its indeavours
for removing the Cause, as being hurtful
to the Foot. But the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Man</hi>
might have been so <hi>order'd</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> that
That same motion in the Brain should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
to the mind any other thing, <hi>viz.</hi>
either it self as 'tis in the Brain, or it self
as it is in the Foot, or in any of the other
forementioned intermediate parts, or
lastly any other thing whatsoever; but
none of these would have so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to the <hi>Conservation</hi> of the <hi>Body.</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:99518:64"/>
In the like manner when we want drink,
from thence arises a certain <hi>dryness</hi> in the
<hi>Throat,</hi> which moves the Nerves thereof,
and by their means the inward parts of
the Brain, and this motion <hi>affects</hi> the <hi>mind</hi>
with the <hi>sense</hi> of <hi>thirst;</hi> because that in
this case nothing is more requisite for us
to know, then that we <hi>want drink</hi> for the
<hi>Preservation</hi> of our <hi>Health.</hi> So of the
Rest.</p>
               <p>From all which 'tis manifest, that (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the <hi>infinite Goodness</hi> of God)
'tis impossible but the <hi>Nature</hi> of Man as
he consists of a <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>body</hi> should be
<hi>deceivable.</hi> For if any cause should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
(not in the Foot but) in the Brain
it self, or in any other part through which
the Nerves are continued from the Foot
to the Brain, that <hi>self same</hi> motion, which
uses to arise from the Foot being troubled,
the <hi>Pain</hi> would be felt <hi>as in the Foot,</hi> and
the <hi>sense</hi> would be <hi>naturally</hi> deceived;
for 'tis consonant to Reason (seeing that
That same motion of the Brain alwayes
represents to the mind that same sense,
and it oftner proceeds from a cause <hi>hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
to the <hi>Foot,</hi> than from any other) I
say 'tis reasonable, that it should make
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99518:65"/>
known to the <hi>mind</hi> the Pain of the <hi>Foot,</hi>
rather than of any other <hi>part.</hi> And so
if a <hi>dryness</hi> of <hi>Throat</hi> arises (not as 'tis
used from the <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>drink</hi> for the
<hi>conservation</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> but) from an
<hi>unusual Cause,</hi> as it happens in a <hi>Dropsie,</hi>
'tis far better that it should <hi>then deceive
us;</hi> then that it should <hi>alwayes deceive</hi>
us when the <hi>Body</hi> is in <hi>Health,</hi> and so of the
Rest.</p>
               <p>And this consideration helps me very
much, not only to <hi>understand</hi> the <hi>Errors</hi>
to which my <hi>Nature</hi> is subject, but also to
<hi>correct</hi> and <hi>avoid</hi> them. For seeing I
know that all my <hi>Senses</hi> do oftener in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
me <hi>falsly</hi> than <hi>truely</hi> in those things
which conduce to the <hi>Bodies advantage;</hi>
and seeing I can use (almost alwayes)
more of them than one to <hi>Examine</hi> the
same thing, as also I can use <hi>memory,</hi> which
joyns present and past things together,
and my <hi>understanding</hi> also, which hath
already discovered to me all the <hi>causes</hi> of
my <hi>Errors,</hi> I ought no longer to fear,
that what my <hi>Senses</hi> daily represent to me
should be false. But especially those <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Doubts</hi> of my First Meditation

for now I plainly discover a great <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
between them, for my <hi>Dreams</hi> are
never <hi>conjoyned</hi> by my <hi>memory</hi> with the
other <hi>actions</hi> of my life, as whatever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
to me <hi>awake</hi> is; and certainly if
(while I were awake) any person should
suddenly appear to me, and presently
disappear (as in <hi>Dreams</hi>) so that I could
not tell <hi>from whence</hi> he came or <hi>where</hi> he
went, I should rather esteem it a <hi>Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ctre</hi>
or <hi>Apparition feign'd</hi> in my Brain, then a
<hi>true Man;</hi> but when such things occur,
as I distinctly know from <hi>whence, where,</hi>
and <hi>when</hi> they come, and I <hi>conjoyn</hi> the
<hi>perception</hi> of them by my <hi>memory</hi> with the
other <hi>Accidents</hi> of my <hi>life,</hi> I am <hi>certain</hi>
they are represented to me <hi>waking</hi> and
not <hi>asleep,</hi> neither ought I in the least to
doubt of their <hi>Truth,</hi> if after I have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
up all my <hi>senses, memory,</hi> and <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>
to their <hi>Examination</hi> I find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in any of them, that clashes with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
truths; For <hi>God</hi> not being a <hi>Deceiver,</hi>
it follows, that In such things I am not
<hi>deceived.</hi> But because the <hi>urgency</hi> of <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:99518:66"/>

                  <p>Then he tells us rightly, <hi>that we cannot

This? But that I may explain the

But seeing that we know not a <hi>substance
immediately by it self,</hi> but by this alone,
that 'tis the <hi>subject</hi> of several <hi>Acts,</hi> it is
very consonant to the commands of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

should examine, whether those <hi>different

we call <hi>corporeal,</hi> as <hi>magnitude, figure, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>

which is the <hi>subject</hi> of <hi>Figure,</hi> and
another <hi>substance</hi> which is the <hi>subject</hi> of

under one common notion of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension.</hi>
Besides there are other <hi>Acts,</hi>
which we call <hi>cogitative</hi> or <hi>thinking,</hi> as
<hi>understanding, will, imagination, sense,</hi> &amp;c.
All which agree under the common noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

it by whatever other name we please, so
we do not confound it with <hi>corporeal sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
because <hi>cogitative Acts</hi> no have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity

and to these alone belongs properly the Name
of an Idea, as when I Think on a Man, a
Chimera, Heaven, an Angel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or God.</p>
               <p>When I Think on a <hi>Man,</hi> I perceive an
<hi>Idea</hi> made up of <hi>Figure</hi> and <hi>Colour,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I may <hi>doubt</hi> whether it be the <hi>Likeness</hi>
of a <hi>Man</hi> or not; and so when I think on
<hi>Heaven.</hi> But when I think on a Chimera,
I perceive an <hi>Image</hi> or <hi>Idea,</hi> of which I
may <hi>doubt</hi> whether it be the <hi>Likeness</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Animal</hi> not only at present Existing,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:99518:74"/>
but possible to Exist, or that ever will Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist
hereafter or not.</p>
               <p>But thinking on an <hi>Angel,</hi> there is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to my Mind sometimes the <hi>Image</hi> of
a <hi>Flame,</hi> sometimes the <hi>Image</hi> of a <hi>Pretty
Little Boy</hi> with <hi>Wings,</hi> which I am certain
has no <hi>Likeness</hi> to an <hi>Angel,</hi> and therefore
that it is not the <hi>Idea</hi> of an <hi>Angel;</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiving
that there are some Creatures,
Who do (as it were) wait upon God, and
are Invisible, and Immaterial, upon the
<hi>Thing Believed</hi> or <hi>supposed</hi> we Impose the
<hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Angel;</hi> Whereas the <hi>Idea,</hi> under
which I Imagine an Angel, is compounded
of the Ideas of sensible Things.</p>
               <p>In the like manner at the Venerable
Name of <hi>God,</hi> we have <hi>no Image</hi> or <hi>Idea</hi>
of God, and therefore we are forbidden
to <hi>Worship God</hi> under any <hi>Image,</hi> least we
should seem to <hi>Conceive</hi> Him that is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable.</p>
               <p>Whereby it appears that we have no <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi>
of <hi>God;</hi> but like one <hi>born blind,</hi> who
being brought to the <hi>Fire,</hi> and perceiving
himself to be <hi>Warmed,</hi> knows there is <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
by which he is <hi>warmed</hi> and Hearing it
called <hi>Fire,</hi> he Concludes that <hi>Fire Exists,</hi>
but yet knows not of what <hi>shape</hi> or <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:99518:75"/>
the Fire is, neither has he any
<hi>Image</hi> or <hi>Idea</hi> thereof in his <hi>Mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So Man knowing that there must be
some <hi>Cause</hi> of his <hi>Imaginations</hi> or <hi>Ideas,</hi> as
also an other <hi>cause before That,</hi> and so <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi>
he is brought at last to an <hi>End,</hi> or
to a <hi>supposal</hi> of some <hi>Eternal Cause,</hi> Which
because it never <hi>began</hi> to <hi>Be</hi> cannot have
any other <hi>Cause before it,</hi> and thence he
Concludes that 'tis <hi>necessary</hi> that some <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Thing Exist:</hi> and yet he has no <hi>Idea</hi>
which He can call the <hi>Idea</hi> of this <hi>Eternal
Thing,</hi> but he names this <hi>Thing,</hi> which
he believes and acknowledges by the
Name <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> proceeds from this
Position, <hi>That we have an Idea of God in
our Mind,</hi> to prove this Theoreme, <hi>That
God (that is an Almighty, Wise, Creatour of
the World) Exists,</hi> whereas he ought to
have explain'd this <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>God</hi> better, and
he should have thence deduced not only
his <hi>Existence,</hi> but also the <hi>Creation</hi> of the
World.</p>

                  <p>None of <hi>Gods</hi> Attributes can proceed
from <hi>outward objects</hi> as from a <hi>Pattern,</hi>
because there is nothing found in God
like what is found in <hi>External,</hi> that is,

And so of his other Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes.</p>
                  <p>And seeing we have made use of that

in this <hi>Idea</hi> such an <hi>Immense Power,</hi>
that we conceive it a contradiction for
<hi>God</hi> to <hi>Exist,</hi> and yet that any thing

demonstrating His existence we demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
also that the whole world, or all
things different from <hi>God,</hi> were <hi>Created</hi>
by God.</p>
                  <p>Lastly when we assert, that some <hi>Ideas</hi>
are <hi>Innate</hi> or <hi>natural</hi> to us, we do not

               <p>* ANd seeing God has given me no Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to know whether these Ideas pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from Bodies or not, but rather a strong
inclination to believe, that these Ideas are
sent from Bodies, I see no reason, why God
should not be counted a Deceiver, if these I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas
came from any where, but from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Beings, and therefore we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that Corporeal Beings exist.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:99518:86"/>'Tis a received opinion, that Physicians
who deceive their Patients for their

<hi>Deceit</hi> does not consist in the <hi>falsity</hi> of

                  <p>'Tis not requisite for the establishment
of my Conclusion, <hi>That we cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

that we cannot be deceived, when that

               <p>* FOr now I plainly discover a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between them (<hi>that is sleep and
waking</hi>) for my Dreams are never conjoyn'd
by my Memory, with the other Actions of my
Life.</p>
               <p>I desire to Know, whether it be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that a Man <hi>dreaming,</hi> that the <hi>doubts</hi>
whether he <hi>dream or not,</hi> may not <hi>Dream,</hi>
that he joyns his <hi>Dream</hi> to the <hi>Ideas</hi> of
things past long since; if he may, than
those <hi>Actions</hi> of his past life, may be
thought as <hi>true</hi> as if he were awake.</p>
               <p>Moreover because (as <hi>D. Cartes</hi> affirms)
the <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> of all <hi>knowledge</hi>
depends only on the <hi>knowledge</hi> of the
<hi>True God,</hi> either an Atheist cannot from
the <hi>Memory</hi> of his past life conclude that
he is <hi>awake,</hi> or else tis possible for a man to
