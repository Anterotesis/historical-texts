            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is an easie vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in these dayes of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to be a conceited In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, but a difficult commendation to bee a serious Author: for whatsoeuer is at all times honestly intended, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is too largely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued.

               </gap> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse a free silence, then a necessarie industrie. Here in this (scarce an) handfull of discourse, is deciphered, not what any
<pb facs="tcp:14640:3"/>
personally is, but what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny personally may be: to the intent, that by the view of others wounds, we might prouide play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and cures for our owne, if occasion impose them. It is true, that all men are not borne in one, the same, or the like pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of qualitie or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for in some, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome is so become ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature, that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, is not the mistresse, but the seruant, not the directresse but the foyle to their passions. Folly is a sale-able merchandise, whose factour, youth is
<pb facs="tcp:14640:4"/>
not so allowedly profest in young men, as pleasure in men of any age: yet are the ruines, the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, the wofull expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences of sundrie presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and samplars of indiscretion and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse (euen in noted, and sometimes in great ones) so apparent, so daily, that no Antidote against the infection, disease, lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of so increasing an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill can be reputed super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous. For my part, I ingeniously acknowledge, that hitherto (how euer the course hath proued a barre to my thrift, yet) I
<pb facs="tcp:14640:4"/>
neuer fawned vpon any mans Fortunes, whose person and merit I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred not. Neither hath any court-ship of applause, set me in a higher straine, a higher pinnacle of opinion, then seuerest Approbation might make warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Howbeit euen in these few lines that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, my ayme hath not beene so grossely leuelled, that I meant to chuse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Reader for my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron: considering that none can challenge any interest herein from me (vnlesse he challenge it
<pb facs="tcp:14640:5"/>
by way of an vsurped im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation) whom I my selfe doe not out of some certaine knowledge and allowance of Desert, as it were poynt out and at, with my finger, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that <hi>Hic est,</hi> it is this one and onely. By which marke, I can deny no man (not guiltie to himselfe of a selfe-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse) to call it his owne: at least, none of those, who freely returne the defects to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per owner, and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit (if any may be) of this little worke to their own vse and themselues. So
<pb facs="tcp:14640:5"/>
much it is to bee presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the verie taliarie Law may require and obtaine. In all things, no one thing can more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitely bee obserued to be practised, then <hi>The Golden Meane:</hi> The exemplification where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, howeuer heretofore attributed, I dare not so poorely vnder-value my selfe and labours, as not to call mine. But if I should farther exceede, I might exceede that meane, which I haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured to commend. Let him that is wise, and therein noble, assume
<pb facs="tcp:14640:6"/>
properly to himselfe this interest, that I cannot distrust the successefull acceptation, where the sacrifice is a thriftie loue; the Patron a great man good (for to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good is to be great) And the Presentor, a feodarie to such as are maisters not more of their own Fortunes then their owne affections.</p>

Many men can <hi>speake well,</hi> few men will <hi>doe well</hi>; The reason, for that we couet to be thought what wee are not, and yet continue to be what wee are asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be thought.

graue Author, That there was neuer any publique mischiefe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in a State by euen Atheists, or very incarnate Deuils, but Religion was their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to effect it; at least a shew of some false zeale in as false a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.

            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:14640:22"/>By this appeareth the richnesse of vertue, that euen such as most op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it, must and are compelled to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it for best. In like manner, euery man in his particular to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish his actions, is in his knowledge guiltie and conscious of what he doth or should doe. We were not borne to feed, sleepe, and spinne out our webbe of life in the delicate softnesse of vanitie, or sloath; wee were not borne to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique in follies, and to make merchandize of

not vain delights: For as we cannot iudge him to haue a light heart alwaies, that som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times laughes (for euen in laughter there is a sadnesse,) so wee must not imitate by any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward demeanor, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray the minoritie of our Resolution, except we would be as childish in vnderstanding as in action.</p>

wel worthy a Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle (and chronicled will bee in a perpetuall memorie) to withstand the seuere assault of Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, pressing on with so infinite an Armie of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers and admirers as shee is accompanyed with: what can one <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate man</hi> do against such a multitude of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?

the best. Since neuer to haue seene euill is no praise to well doing; but where the Actours of Mischiefe are a Nation, there and amongst them to liue well is a Crowne of immortall commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
            <p>A Golden Axiome there was registred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Ciuilians in the daies of <hi>Iustinian: That it was not conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for any man to pry and looke after what was done at Rome, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine iustly what ought there to bee done.

the World, all sorts of euery people came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from thence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Oracles of life (as they might bee ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:) yet doth it not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that any one man with the multitude, should runne to <hi>Rome,</hi> to sucke the infection of dissolute intemperature. <hi>Vanity</hi> most commonly rides coach't in the high way, the beaten way, the common way; But <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Moderation</hi> walkes alone.

            <p>Here is in Text Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters layd before vs, the hazard, perill and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualty of A PVBLIKE MAN: the possibilitie what Miserie, Calamity, Ruine, Greatnesse and Popularitie may winde him into. Heere is decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered the vnauoyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and incessant Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of their Honors and Ioyes: <hi>Flatterie and Enuie two ancient
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14640:47"/>
Courtiers.</hi> It comes now to conclusion, that it cannot be denyed, but those <hi>publike men</hi> haue (notwithstanding these) chiefe and immediate meanes in their owne powers, if they well and nobly order their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to make their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey their Debtors, and to enroll their names in the glorious Register of an euer-memorable Glorie: especially if they be not too partially do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on euery commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Vertue, which in priuate men is reputed as it is, a Vertue; but in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14640:48"/>
them a Miracle. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly (without dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to desert in great men) there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular persons, fit for publike imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whose ablenesse and sufficiencie, is no way inferiour to the prayses of the mightiest, but that they are clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in their lownesse, &amp; obscured in their priuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but else would &amp; could giue testimony to the World, that all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and perfection is not confined to Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and Authoritie.</p>
            <p>A PVBLIKE MAN,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14640:48"/>
therefore, shunning the Adulation of a Parasite (which hee may easily discouer, if hee wisely examine his merit with their Hyperbolical insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations,) then keeping an euen course in the processe of lawfull and iust actions, auoyding the toyles, snares and trappes of the enuious, cannot chuse in his own lifetime, but build a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument, to which the Triumph and Trophies of his memorie, shall giue a longer life then the perpetuitie of stone, Marble or Brasse can
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14640:49"/>
preserue. Otherwise if they stand not on the guard of their owne Pietie and Wisedome, they will vpon trifles sometime or other bee quarrelled against and euicted. Neyther may they imagine that any one taint (howsoeuer they would bee conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to winke at it in themselues, supposing it to be (as perhaps it is) little, and not worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension) can escape vnespyed. For the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the Poets Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a goodly Lesson for their instruction. It
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14640:49"/>
is said that <hi>Thetis</hi> the Mother of <hi>Achilles,</hi> drencht him being an Infant in the <hi>Stygian</hi> Waters, that thereby, his whole bodie might bee made invulnerable: but see the seueritie of Fate, for euen in that part of the heele that his Mother held him by, was hee shot by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of <hi>Paris,</hi> of which wound he dyed. In like case, may euery States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man bee like <hi>Achilles</hi> in the generall body of his Actions, impassible and secure from any assault of wilfull and grosse en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normitie:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14640:50"/>
yet if he giue way to <hi>but one</hi> handfull (as it may be termed) of Folly, not becomming the grauity and greatnes of his Calling; hee shall soone meete with some watchfull <hi>Paris,</hi> some industrious Flatterer, or ouer-busie enuious Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitour, that will take aduantage of his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and wound his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie to the ruine of his Honours, if not to the ieopardy of his life.</p>
            <p>The period of all shal be knit vp, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise of a famous learned &amp; Philosopher:<note place="margin">

By a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, honest counsells, and iust actions, the true good is acquired. Other moment any delights only supple the forehead, not vnburthen and solace the heart. They are nothing, alasse they are nothing, it is the minde must be well disposed, it is the minde must bee confident: it is the mind aboue all things
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14640:51"/>
must be rectified; and the true comfort is not easily attayned, and yet with more difficulty retayned.</hi> But hee, he who directs all his whole priuate life in hononurable proiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, cannot any way misse our LINE OF LIFE, which points at the immortalitie of a vertuous name by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably discharging the burthen of such imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as are vsually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed vpon those, whom their callings haue enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled <hi>Publike men.</hi>

the man, that euen the greatest or lowest should both <hi>bee,</hi> and resolue <hi>to be.</hi> And this much may be confidently auerred; That men of eminent commands, are not in generall more feared in the tyde of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, then beloued, in the ebbe of that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, if they beare it with moderation. Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists honoured or fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, (for fauour and honour are for the most part inseparable) haue the eyes of the World vpon their carriage, in the carriage eyther of

their glories or deiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: It is not to bee doubted (which is a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular comfort) but any sequestration from a woonted height, is only but a tryall; for beeing managed with humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and gratitude, it may ennoble the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents (for their owne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars) to demeane themselues excellently, in the places they had before (may bee) some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too neglectfully discharged.

or ecclipse of eminence, must not so make a man vndervalue his owne Desert, but that a <hi>Noble Resolution,</hi> should still vphold its owne worth, in deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing well; if wee ayme and intend to repute &amp; vse Honours, but as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentall causes of vertuous effects in Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. To all such as so doe, (and all should so doe that are worthy to bee such,) a seruice not to be neglected is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per debt: especially from inferiour Ministers to those, whose Creation,
