            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>GOD who alone is <hi>perfect</hi> in Himſelf, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined this Prerogative to Himſelf, That His <hi>Work</hi> ſhould be <hi>perfect</hi> (as <hi>Moſes</hi> speaks) And as another Holy One hath it, <hi>doth al his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Paul,</hi> though in what-ever he was to commit to writing (in matters ſacred) had infalibility of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſistance, yet perfected not all be intended: <hi>Theſe things we will do, if God permit,</hi> ſaid he to the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> But we no where find extant any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <note place="margin">Heb.</note> that he accompliſhed what he there intended; Namely, A full Methodical Diſcourſe upon thoſe <hi>firſt Principles,</hi> and <hi>Foundations of Religion,</hi> which that ſpeech had reference unto. It is no wonder then, that if <hi>ſuch</hi> a kind of <hi>Imperfection</hi> accompanied the <hi>Works</hi> of ſo great a <hi>Maſter-builder,</hi> if it attend thoſe who build on this Foundation, and are not privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged (as yet he was) <hi>from building Hay and ſtubble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſort of <hi>Incompleatneſs</hi> hath befallen the <hi>Works</hi> of this worthy Author, in reſpect to the fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of this Propheſie, which he intended, and had performed; wherein yet to the Church of God, there ſhal be no loſs, there being no thoughts nor Notions ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to any man, which though for the preſent they die with him. But the ſame Spirit that is the inſpirer of
<pb facs="tcp:43340:3"/>
all, doth bring to light in ſome one or other ſervant of God, in his own time.</p>
            <p>What a Treaſury of Thoughts ſeemed to be loſt, and to die with the Savior of the World, which he had not, could not then utter; which yet the Spirit that fil'd him <hi>without meaſure,</hi> diſtributed amongst the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> that came after him, according <hi>to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt</hi> in each. There is no beam of Divine Light hath ſhone into any mans heart that ſhal finaly, and for ever be put <hi>under a Buſhel;</hi> but in the end ſhall be ſet up, <hi>to give light to the whol Houſe.</hi>

                  <p>Now the Note of Obſervation is this.</p>

God he delights in his Saints, and there is nothing in the world that ſhould ſanctifie a gracious heart more than this, <hi>That God loves him;</hi> And as Gods love is extraordinary to them more than to other People, ſo their love again ſhould be reflected upon God in a more than ordinary way; There's nothing can be a recompence to Love, but Love: that's certain, Love is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſatiſfied but with Love; And therefore, ſeeing God profeſſes love to his people, he doth expect love from them, therefore he will not be ſatisfied with any duties you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, whatſoever you do, but it muſt be out of Love, Love muſt have Love, and know, that you cannot prize Gods love more than God prizes yours, there is nothing in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth that God prizes more than the love of his Saints, and therefore, if ever Gods love, or Gods prizing of your love, may gain love, Oh you Saints, love the Lord. That's the firſt.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, <hi>It's a great aggravation unto ſin, to ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt love.</hi> For to that end God here ſhews that he loved <note place="margin">Obſ. 2.</note> them, that he might aggravate their ſin ſo much the more, and cleer himſelf. Many times you make in the daies of your humiliation, and at other times, many aggravations of your ſin, that your ſin it is againſt knowledge; this is great; That your ſin it is of an hainous nature, that it doth a great deal of hurt, that it brings you under dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful threatnings, that it provokes the wrath of an infinite God againſt you; theſe are great things for the humbling of your hearts for ſin. But above all aggrevations for ſin, this is the great aggravation, That your ſin is againſt Love, that though God hath ſhown much love to you, yet you ſin againſt a loving God, and a gracious God. God begins with this aggravation, being his ſcope here to cleer himſelf, and to charge his people of ungratefulneſs, yet God loved them. Oh! ſins againſt love are great ſins in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>

Gods old &amp; ancient love; when we ſee any further expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods love it may encourage us upon the thoughts of his former love, there was an old love and this God continues, his old love unto his people, and ſurely God intends yet further love unto us.</p>
                  <p>And then for our ſelves in particular, It's very good for <note place="margin">Particul. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould recal Gods antient love unto them when they were children</note> us to look back unto his ancient love: That is, Now God hath loved ſome of you from your child-hood, how the providence of God did work towards you then; Some of you (I ſuppoſe) in this place may ſay, that God loved you when you were children, when I was a child I had ſuch and ſuch expreſſions of Gods love towards me, It was love that I was born of Chriſtian Parents, and that I was brought up in Chriſtian education, That I was delivered from ſuch and ſuch dangers, yea (it may be) God began to reveal himſelf to me betimes.

                  <p>It is firſt, To raiſe up your faith, if you are able, upon ſuch grounds as theſe are, Upon the conſideration of his love to his people when they were unworthy.</p>

It is a ſtrange ſight indeed to ſee a child of God, an Heir of Heaven, a Co heir with Jeſus Chriſt, one dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer unto God, than Heaven and Earth, to be under the power, the humors, the luſts of wicked men, of baſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly <note place="margin">Gods Sons ſlaves to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan oft-times, and for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

But now they may know themſelves to be Sons, and yet ſlaves to the humors of wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men, there is not a ſtranger ſight in the world, I <note place="margin">which is the admiration of Angels.</note> beleeve the Angels in Heaven do not ſee a ſtranger ſight that they more admire at, when they ſee a godly man to be under the luſts of wicked men; but this is Gods work for the preſent: God intends to manifeſt himſelf in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way hereafter, but for the preſent he fetches about the glory of his own ends this way, to let even his own dear ſons to be in <hi>Egypt.</hi> But God calls them out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> God hath his time to deliver his people and call them out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> and 'tis but a <hi>Call,</hi> and it's done, it is <note place="margin">God hath his time to call them out of that ſlavery.</note> as eaſily done as a man that gives a call for ſuch a one out of ſuch a place; let our bondage be never ſo great, 'tis but a word from God to deliver us.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>It is a great mercy to be cal'd out of</hi> Egypt. This the Lord here brings as a great teſtimony of his love to <note place="margin">Obſ. 5.</note> them, that he calls them out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> In <hi>Exod. 12. 42.

                     <hi>their Generations;</hi> To be called from that <hi>Egypt</hi> was a fruit of Love; and ſo to be called from ſpiritual <hi>Egypt,</hi> (for mans natural eſtate, is a ſpiritual <hi>Egypt)</hi> to be cal'd from <hi>Antichriſtian Egypt</hi> is a great fruit of Love; and as 'tis a fruit of love, ſo it is an aggravation of ſin, for ſo it is brought, <hi>I called my Son out of</hi> Egypt, and yet they did thus and thus.</p>
                  <p>If God remembred this mercy, of calling them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſo many years before as an aggravation of their ſin,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43340:23"/>
how much more may the Lord make that an aggravation of our ſin that called us of late out of that <hi>Egypt</hi> that we <note place="margin">Applicat. to <hi>England.</hi>

Many waies I might ſhew you that we were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a great, if not a greater bondage than the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were under in <hi>Egypt.</hi> And there hath been as out ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched an arm (though not ſo obvious to ſence) in calling of us out, as in calling of them out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> now let not this be an aggravation of our ſin, the ſound of our cries under the yoke of our bondage is not yet out of our ears, and the very ſores of our ſhoulders through their yokes are not yet throughly healed, and therefore if we now before the ſound be out of our ears and our ſores be healed, yet grow to be wanton, fooliſh, vain proud, cruel, oppreſſing one another, and abuſing of our liberty, Oh! our ſin muſt needs be accounted exceeding great before God.</p>
                  <p>Well, but yet we ſee not all the mind of God in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <note place="margin">The Text as cited <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 15, further expounded.</note> nor the chief part of his mind, for we find in in <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 15. that there the holy Ghoſt cites this Scripture that now I am opening to you, and interprets it of Jeſus Chriſt. When Jeſus Chriſt was fain to fly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Egypt</hi> to ſave his life, the holy Ghoſt ſaith, That it was to fulfil that Scripture, <hi>I called my Son out of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</p>
                  <p>It is a very ſtrange Interpretation, (as we have divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch in the new Teſtament) and <hi>Hierom</hi> upon the place ſaith, That <hi>Julian</hi> takes advantage upon this, and <note place="margin">Hierom <hi>in loc. Matthew</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation ſeems ſtrange to ſome.</note> ſome of the <hi>Jews,</hi> with others that hated Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, did take much advantage upon this quotation of <hi>Matthew,</hi> againſt the Authority of the Goſpel, and ſaid, ſurely it argued <hi>Matthew</hi> very unskilful in Scripture, that he ſhould make ſuch a quotation as this, when it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant that it is ſpoken of the calling of the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And truly we ſhould never have thought that there had been ſuch a meaning in this place of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> had we not found it ſo interpreted by the holy
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43340:24"/>
Ghoſt. And by the way, before we come to open that, and ſhew how that was a right quotation of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I'le but obſerve this one Note from it, that we may ſee that by the interpretation both of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and divers other places we find in the new Teſtament, that there is much more of the mind of God in the old Teſtament, than was ordinarily known to them that lived in thoſe times. Which of the Jews could have made ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, <hi>I have called my Son out of</hi> Egypt? That is, Jeſus Chriſt after he is born, he ſhall be perſecuted and forced to fly for his life, and that into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and he ſhall come again out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> who could have thought the holy Ghoſt could have intended ſuch a thing as this is? Things were not underſtood til they came to be fulfilled, and then they were underſtood. And the truth is, as in the old Teſtament, ſo in the new, there are a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Scriptures that we underſtand yet but little of. And the time of our knowing the meaning of them is reſerved to the time when they are to be fulfilled, many Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies we have in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and other places, that are (I am confident) as dark to us as this place of <hi>Hoſea</hi> was dark to the Jews; and there is as excellent a ſpiritual meaning in many places of the new Teſtament hidden from us, that will hereafter to the Church of God be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed cleerly, as there were in the old Teſtament, many places (I know not whether I may ſay as many as thoſe) but are as much hidden from us.

                  <p>Interpreters I do find do much weary and tire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the readers about this point, and thoſe that will ſearch into Interpreters about the aptneſs of this quotation may quickly ſpend daies in it, I find the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions reduced to theſe three heads.</p>
                  <p>Some think that <hi>Matthew</hi> quotes this but only by way <note place="margin">Opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the place in <hi>Matthew.</hi>
                     </note> of alluſion, and ſimilitude, that there is a ſimilitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſts going to <hi>Egypt</hi> and returning, as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iſraels going to <hi>Egypt</hi> and returning, but that is a fridged and a poor, weak Interpretation, and againſt what is ſaid in <hi>Matthew,</hi> which ſaith it was that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might be fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>But the ſecond hath more in it, which is of <hi>Junius</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Junius <hi>in loc.</hi> Paralel. lib. 1. Paral. 6. Iſa. 2. 9.</note> that learned man, he thinks that the very litteral ſenſe of the place is rather a Propheſie of Chriſts going into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> and returning again, than of the people of Iſraels go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>Egypt</hi> and returning again. So he ſaith in his Paralels, in his 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the firſt book, it is (ſaith he) as if God ſhould ſay, I have threatned that I will utterly deſtroy the King of Iſrael, what ſhall I wholly deſtroy Iſrael therefore? No no, I will not do that for my Sons ſake, for though Iſrael is unworthy and receive not my Son, and by my Sons going into <hi>Egypt</hi> it is declared that they are unworthy of him, and that they ſhould never have my Son come among them again, yet he ſhall come amongſt them again, and that ſhall be an evidence to them that I will not caſt off my people of Iſrael, and it's a very ſpiritual and good Interpretation, and we find of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43340:25"/>
that, the Lord when he did promiſe mercy to his people, and would give an evidence that he would not deſtroy them, he would give a promiſe of Jeſus Chriſt; as in <hi>Iſa. 9. 6. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 9. 6.</note> he ſeals the Promiſe that he will not caſt off his people by promiſing the Meſſias; ſo <hi>Junius</hi> thinks that the Lord here doth ſeal this promiſe of mercy to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he will not utterly cut off his own people, Why? becauſe he will call his Son out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, yet I cannot think that it will fully ſatiſfie, but <note place="margin">3. preferred.</note> I will give you that which may more cleerly appear to be the mind of God, and that's this, That this Scripture in <hi>Hoſea,</hi> it was intended to be typical, not only to ſhew <note place="margin">(ſo <hi>Hierom</hi> on <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 1. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it.)</note> what was paſt, that God did indeed call his people out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but to be a type of what God did intend for the time to come; as to give you other inſtances, there are many things that are ſpoken in the old Teſtament, that are ſpoken litterally of ſome other things, and yet apparantly are meant typically of Jeſus Chriſt, firſt in <hi>Exodus,</hi> 12. 46. compared with <hi>John,</hi> 19. 26. in <hi>Exodus,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 12. 46. and Joh. 19. 36. compared</note> it is in the inſtitution of the Paſs-over where God ſaith, <hi>Not a bone of it ſhould be broken:</hi> Now in <hi>John</hi> 19. 36. it is ſaid, when as the Soldiers came to break the bones of the two Theeves that were upon the Croſs, through a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they find that Chriſt was dead and ſo they broke not Chriſts bones. One would think now that this were a meer accidental thing, but yet the holy Ghoſt ſaith there, it was for the folfilling of that Propheſie, that not a bone ſhould be broken. Thus you ſee things that <note place="margin">Things acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dene.</note> are very accidental yet God hath a ſpecial work in them, God intends great things by things that ſeem to be of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle moment in our eyes, What more light thing than that, that they ſhould not break the bones of Chriſt? <note place="margin">Great things intended of God by ſmal.</note> though meant cleerly at firſt, &amp; litterally concerning the paſchal Lamb, yet typically concerning Jeſus Chriſt. Compare two other Scriptures together in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 14.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43340:25"/>
with <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 5. in <hi>Sam.</hi> it's apparantly ſpoken concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">2 Sam. 7. 14. Heb. 1. 5. compared alſo.</note> 
                     <hi>Solomon, I will be his Father, and he ſhall be my Son.</hi> But now the Apoſtle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 5. he ſpeaks of Chriſt there cleerly, and ſaith, <hi>To which of the Angels bath he ſaid, Thou art my ſon, this day have I begotten thee?</hi> and again ſaith he, <hi>he ſhall be my Son, and I will be a Father to him.</hi> It's meant firſtly of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and typically meant of Jeſus Chriſt. So the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> going into <hi>Egypt</hi> and turning back again, are meant litterally of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but God meant to Propheſie what would be done with Chriſt, that he ſhould go to <hi>Egypt</hi> and return back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, <hi>God hath an eye to Chriſt in all things he</hi>

                  <p>And we ſhall ſee hereafter (take this Note) that it will be one great part of the Glory of the Saints to ſee how <note place="margin">which to ſee wil be one part of the Saints glory.</note> God had an eye to Jeſus Chriſt in all his great works in the world; now we look upon ſuch a work, and ſuch a work to have ſuch an influence upon ſuch a buſineſs, but we do not ſee the reference that it hath to Jeſus Chriſt; hereafter it will be a ſpecial part of the glory of the Saints that they ſhall ſee how in all the works of God, he had an eye to Jeſus Chriſt; even the work of Creation; God would not have created the world but for his Son, and the fall, and in every thing he had an eye to his Son, for the magnifying the great work of his Son, and ſuch who had a ſpecial work of the Spirit of God in thoſe times did underſtand Gods meaning, though ordinarily they did not: I remember one learned Interpreter hath this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, to ſhew how they might underſtand Gods mind by his types, he expreſſes it thus, As it was with <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> when he carried his Bow and Arrows into the field <note place="margin">A ſimilitude.</note>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:43340:26"/>
to give <hi>David</hi> a note whether he ſhould fly away for fear of <hi>Saul,</hi> or return back again. Now when <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſhot his Arrows, he ſaid unto his youth, It is beyond, and on this ſide. Now the youth knew no more but thus, that he was to look at the Arrow; yea, but ſaith he, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> knew more, that when he ſaid it was beyond him, then he ſhould do thus, and when it was on this ſide then he ſhould do thus.

                  <p>From whence there are theſe Notes of Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>When God calls his people out of afflictions, yet they</hi>

                     <hi>know no more how to go, to guide themſelves in their way than a little child doth.</hi> We think if we be delivered from ſuch and ſuch an evil we are well, but when God doth grant deliverance if he ſhould leave us there, we ſhould quickly ſpoil our ſelves, we ſhould quickly turn the mercies that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43340:30"/>
we have into miſery if we be left but a while; It is the pride of mens hearts that makes them venturous of them ſelves, hence they get many a knock and bruiſe; Oh! many ſtumble in their way and ſplit themſelves and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh becauſe they will be going themſelves and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon Gods hand.</p>
                  <p>We find by experience now God hath brought us out <note place="margin">Uſe for <hi>England.</hi>
                     </note> of <hi>Egypt</hi> here, in great meaſure we are called out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and we hope that God intends a <hi>Canaan</hi> to us, yet what children are we? we do not know how to ſtep a ſtep in our way, Oh! how often have we been at a ſtand in our way ſince God hath been pleaſed to call us out of <hi>Egypt?</hi> we have been at a maze; not knowing which way to take, this way or that way, Oh! how often have we fallen in our way, and gone aſtray? If ever peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had need to have God to teach them how to go, then <note place="margin">Our path un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troden.</note> have we at this day; our path is an untroden path, and there are many ſtumbling blocks in our way, we often ſtumble and fall in them; Poor children have not more need to have the hand of the Parent or Nurſe, when they go upon the Ice, in ſlippery waies, then we have need of the hand of God upon us to leade us in our way and to guide us. That's the firſt Note.</p>

                     </note> Egyptians God that they made accompt was the God that did watch thoſe that went out of their Country without any leave, they came before that God that was the God for their watching thoſe that went out of their their Country, and to keep them from going out, and between the Mountains, and the Sea before them, and a great Army behind them, and yet God taught them to go; what a way doth God teach them to go in? And then when they go further they muſt go through the Sea, or no other way, God taught them to go through the Sea, and when they have gone through the Sea, Is all the evil over? No, they muſt come into the waſt howling wilderneſs, and there be led along for fourty years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and yet God doth reckon up his guidance of them here in this way as a fruit of his love.</p>
                  <p>So long as we are in Gods way, though the way be difficult, yet we have cauſe to bleſs God that we are in <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> his way, and let not us be troubled at the difficulty of our way when we ſee God before us, and leading us in our way.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Though we meet with difficulties in our way, yet God loves to teach his people how to go in their way; and the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>more difficult their way is, the more care hath God of them to teach them how to go.</hi> We do not find ſuch an expreſſion of Gods care of them to teach them in any other way but this of theirs, when they went firſt out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> becauſe that way was the moſt difficult, therfore God takes upon him in a ſpecial manner to teach them in that way.</p>
                  <p>Be not diſcouraged at your difficulties, but when you <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> are in your way, and your conſcience tels you that it is not a way that you have choſen to your ſelves, look up to God for guidance, cry to him; as you find in <hi>Pſal. 107. 6.

When we have been in the greateſt ſtraits <note place="margin">England.</note> and have had the hardeſt way to go, how hath God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken us up in his arms! Through Gods mercy, though we be very weak; yet we are gone on a great way even from <hi>Egypt,</hi> from our ſpiritual <hi>Egypt</hi> and bondage. It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſs in people, to ſay, We are in as bad a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as ever we were. VVhat God may bring us to through the unthankfulneſs of men we know not, but certainly through Gods mercy we have been led along a great way in our journey, God hath taught us to go; it hath not been the wiſdom nor providence of men that hath carried us on in our way ſo far as we have been, no, we have found apparantly we are not much beholden to the wiſdom of men for that way that we have been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in, but 'tis God that hath come in in our ſtraits, we ſee by what hath fallen out, how we ſhould have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in our way, we ſhould have returned into <hi>Egypt;</hi> how often have we been ready to think, Would things were with us as heretofore they have been: Oh! this hath been the peeviſhneſs of our ſpirits, to be thinking of turning into <hi>Egypt:</hi> as it was with this people, though God was with them in their way, yet often they thought of returning back again.

well applied to <hi>England</hi> at this day; Oh! how long wil we go about? that is, ſhifting this way and that, and not daring to truſt God in his way; we are afraid that if we ſhould go on in the right path that God guids us in, that we ſhould miſcarry, and therefore we go about, and that's the reaſon it is ſo long before we have our delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, becauſe we go about, and do not follow Gods guidance in our way. There's an excellent promiſe that God makes to his people in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 9. in reference to the <note place="margin">Jer. 31. 9. illuſtrated.</note> guiding of them in their way from their Captivity; <hi>They ſhal come with weeping, and with ſupplications wil I lead them: I will cauſe them to walk by the rivers of waters, in a ſtraight way wherein they ſhall not ſtumble: for I am a father to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>aud</hi> Ephraim <hi>is my firſt born.</hi> This is a Scripture very ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to that Scripture we are now opening. It's a fruit of fatherly love to guide us in a ſtraight way, and keep us from ſtumbling.

We may apply this to Gods guidance of the ſoul from ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Egypt;</hi> when God brings the ſoul out of the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <note place="margin">Applied to the guidence of the ſoul.</note> bondage he guides it in the way to heavenly <hi>Canaan:</hi> you whom the Lord are bringing out of your Spiritual Bondage, look up to God to teach you how to go: why?

horſes get into holes and ſtumble, and it may be the man breaks his leg or ſhoulder before him, if it proves not to be deadly to him; now if you ſhould ſee a man falling and breaking his leg or arms, falling down with his horſe in ſuch dangerous waies as there is in many places, would you not have cauſe to bleſs God that you are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from that, that God hath preſerved your limbs? Thus when you ſee Profeſſors falling in the way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion, Oh! bleſs God that he teaches you in your way, that he guides you. To women that are weak in waies that are ſlipery you will take hold of their hands to guide them; and ſo God doth to you, know the whol courſe of your way from ſpiritual <hi>Egypt</hi> to ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Canaan,</hi> it is Ice and rugged al the way, that God is fain to take you by the hand, and Oh! the goodneſs of God to condeſcend thus to his poor Creatures, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelf to a Nurſe, Oh! how often would we run into harms way (as we uſe to ſay) if God did not lead us?</p>

                  <p>And then laſtly, Seeing the tender care of God, like a Parent or a Nurſe towards the Child, is made an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their duty, and an aggravation of their ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not what they ought to be.

                  <p>Many times children, though there be a great care to <note place="margin">Expoſ.</note> teach them how to go, yet they will venture themſelves, and by their venturouſneſs and wantoneſs they get many a knock and bruiſe. So it was with this people, indeed my care was towards them, but they would go their own way, and they often bruiſed themſelves. Well, did God therefore reject them and ſay, It is through your own fault that you have gotten theſe bruiſes and maims. No, <hi>I healed them</hi> ſaith God. Though he were never ſo froward, and he got by that many bruiſes, yet my pity was ſo great that I healed thoſe very bruiſes and maims that he got by his wilfulneſs.</p>

                     <hi>I hid me and was wrath, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.</hi> He went on frowardly when I ſmote him; what then? in the 18. verſe, <hi>I have ſeen his waies.</hi> One would have thought that ſhould have followed, I have ſeen his waies, and I'le ſmite him, and plague him, and make him to know what it is to deal ſo frowardly and perverſely with me, but, behold the goodneſs of the Lord! Gods waies are not the waies of men, his thoughts are not our thoughts, for he ſaith, <hi>I have ſeen his waies, and will heal him, and reſtore comforts to him;</hi> I will not ſay, I will never leade him more, becauſe he would not regard my teaching but goes his own waies and gets ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bruiſes; No, I have ſeen his waies and will heal him, and lead him notwithſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Oh! be not diſcouraged when you have gone out of <note place="margin">Uſe</note> Gods way, but be troubled and aſhamed, make uſe of this promiſe, the Lord ſees the frowardneſs of his people, and yet will heal them, and lead them, and reſtore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to them.</p>
                  <p>And my brethren, thus hath the Lord dealt graciou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly with us in our inconſiderate, fooliſh, ſinful courſes, <note place="margin">Applicat. to <hi>England.</hi>
                     </note> how often we in this Land have been brought low by our inconſiderate, fooliſh waies, we have been ſore woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, we have been in danger to bleed to death by the falls that we have got, we have often given all for gone as it were, mens waies have been ſo perverſe and croſs as there hath been little hope of any good, that ſometimes when we have met together we have even ſaid, al is gone, we are but betraied, and therefore there is little hope of any good; Have not we oftentimes ſaid thus? but the Lord hath come in and healed us, and that Scripture in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. hath been made good unto us, the Lord hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the frowardneſs of our waies, and yet hath healed us, and yet hath led us. You have gone one in ſuch and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43340:35"/>
ſuch waies ſaith God, and you have even undone your ſelves in them, and you were made but fools, and others ſquandered away your eſtates and nothing came of it; well, you knew not what to do, I'le leade you in waies that you do not think of, in ſuch waies as you have the leaſt hopes of good by, I wil lead you on in thoſe waies and reſtore comfort to you. My Brethren, the waies that the Lord hath this laſt Summer reſtored comfort to <hi>England</hi> by, were they waies that any of you did think of this time twelve month? Certainly it was never in the imaginations and thoughts of men to be brought in ſuch waies as the Lord hath lead us in, and reſtored comforts <note place="margin">The New-Model of the Army, 1645.</note> to us by, the Lord did ſee that the way of the old Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery was not the way to reſtore comforts to <hi>England,</hi> but the Lord hath led us in other waies: well, let Gods hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of our bruiſes that we get in walking in our own waies make us thankful and careful that we run not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully into any ſuch waies any more, that we be not ſtill more ventrous, and more careleſs; if we be, God may ſuffer us to break our bones; for though God be patient and loving, and merciful, yet he hath times to leave men in the perverſneſs of their waies, it may coſt us dear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are healed if God doth leave us, though God may not take away his love, to caſt us wholly off, I but we may be forced to cry again and again with <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Pſal, 51.

good that we know not of; not only in preventing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in a day that we know not of, but in healing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, we attribute our healing to this and the other cauſe; but it is God that comes in in the uſe of means, ſomtimes comes in beyond means; though means oftentimes hath been uſed and no good hath been done by them, at laſt God by a ſecret and inviſible bleſſing he comes and heals us; we muſt not envie at the honor that is due to Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; But certainly by the healing that we have had this laſt Summer, we have cauſe to look beyond all men and means; though God hath uſed means, yet it is God that hath healed us, and they deſire that we ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute all the Glory to God, our healing hath been ſuch that except we even maliciouſly ſhut our eyes we cannot but know and acknowledg that God hath healed us in great meaſure; Oh! let not us by our pride and ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, our oppreſſion, our fooliſhneſs make it appear that we do not acknowledg that God hath healed us, God <note place="margin">God ſtands much upon it to <hi>be</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the healer of his people.</note> ſtands much upon that, becauſe it is his Glory to heal his people therefore he ſtands much upon it to be acknowledged to be the healer of his people.

                  <p>Here's a fourth or fifth expreſſion of Gods love,; for there was two in the former Verſe, <hi>Taught them to go,</hi> and <hi>healed them.</hi> Now here's the fifth, <hi>I drew them with cords of a man, with bonds of love.</hi> God ſtill aggravates his mercy that they might ſee their ſin. As there's no ſuch way to be kindly humbled for ſin, as to ſee it againſt much mercy.
<q>I drew them with cords of a man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some would carry this as if it were a proper name, <note place="margin">Expoſ. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>with the cords of Adam,</hi> for ſo the word is, for the word <hi>Adam,</hi> ſignifies a man of red earth.</p>
                  <p>But it's rather to be taken appellatively, <hi>with the cords of a man,</hi> that is, I did not deal with them like beaſts, <note place="margin">2.</note> which muſt be drawn or put on with violence, my way was not thus with them, to draw them and to have Iron Chains about them, or ſtrong cords to force them on in their way, no ſaith he, I dealt with them like men, I drew them on with the Cords of a man. It doth note <note place="margin">Cords of a man what</note> theſe three things:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I dealt with them in a rational way, as men, not as beaſts, and ſought to draw them in that way, as men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:43340:37"/>
Secondly, I dealt with them in a gentle way, not with rigor and violence, but as a man, for they were humane, ſo my waies were waies ſutable to their humanity: as the Scripture ſometimes ſpeaks of the <hi>Rods</hi> of men, I'le chaſtiſe them with the <hi>Rods of men,</hi> by which ſome think is meant, (that is) more gentle, I dealt with them gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>And then thirdly, <hi>With the Cords of a man,</hi> that is, I dealt with them in ſuch waies as were honorable to them, as were ſutable to that reſpect that is due to a man. I conſidered that they were men made at firſt according to my Image, and they were the moſt excellent Creatures that I had upon the earth here, and therefore I dealt with them in a way ſutable to their Nature, to preſerve the honor of their humane Nature, <hi>Rationally, Gently, Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Conſider how Rationally God dealt with this <note place="margin">1. How God dealt rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> 1. A Law in its ſelf ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Deut. 4. 8.</note> people.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Law that I gave to them it was according to the Principles of <hi>right Reaſon,</hi> there was nothing in my Law but was ſutable to the very principles of right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. ſaith he, <hi>The Nations ſhal hear al theſe Statutes, and ſay, Surely this great Nation is a wiſe and underſtanding people,</hi> (why?) in the 8 verſe, <hi>What Nation is there ſo great, that hath Statutes and Judgments ſo righteous, as all this Law which I ſet before you this day?</hi> Mark, all the Nations that are about you ſhall ſay, What Nation is there ſo wiſe, that hath Statutes and Judgments like this Nation? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">explained.</note> then my Law it had abundance of Reaſon in it, it had the reaſon that might convince not only you, but all the Nations about you; I drew you with the Cords of a man, in a rational way.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>God ſtrengthened it with many Arguments,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Backt with Reaſons.</note> 
                     <hi>which is ſome way beyond the manner of men;</hi> If the Lord had but only given out his Law, and left men to find out the meaning, it had been enough; yea, but the Lord drew
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43340:38"/>
them with the Cords of a man, that is, added to his Law many Arguments and Reaſons to ſhew the equitie of the Law that he had given to them: now men think it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough if they give out a Law, you do not uſe to have the proof of the Law and the reaſon of it; yea, but ſaith God, I drew them with the Cords of a man, I gave them a Law that had reaſon in it, and explain'd that; as if we ſhould go no further than the very moral Law, ſee how God begins, <hi>I am Jehovah thy God, that brought thee out of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Preface to the Decalogue.</note> 
                     <hi>the Land of</hi> Egypt, every word a Reaſon to back the Law.</p>
                  <p>I am Jehovah, therefore obey. I am thy God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obey. I am thy God that brought thee out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> therefore obey. So you ſhall ſee how the Lord doth argue his Law by the ſtrength of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>Yea, not only Reaſon, but many Perſwaſions and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, <note place="margin">3. Urg'd with Motives. Deur. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4, 5, 6.</note> and Exhortations, as man deals with man, if you reade the 4, 5, and 6. Chapters of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> you ſhall find all thoſe, with Motives, and Perſwaſions, beſides Reaſons, to draw them on to obedience, Now Motives and Perſwaſions are the Cords of a man, to draw man as a rational Creature.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If there were any objections that they had, I anſwered al their objections. Do not you find when you <note place="margin">4. Cleered from Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</note> come to hear the Word, that the Word meets with every ſecret objection, you can have no ſecret objection againſt any thing that God requires but at ſome time or other the Word meets with it.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, Yea, I called them to reaſon with me, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">5. God deſires con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>erence with us Iſa. 1. 18.</note> I dealt with them like rational Creatures, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Come, let us reaſon together,</hi> ſaith God; ſee how God deals with people after the manner of men: As now, If you ſhould fall out with a neighbor, and it may be your neighbor is froward and humorous, but now, you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to overcome your own paſſion, and you go to him <note place="margin">Simile.</note>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:43340:38"/>
and ſay, I pray thee let us reaſon the caſe together, and if it be yours, take it; now you deal with him like a man. So God, why ſaith he, let us reaſon the caſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, be not carried on with humor and paſſion, but let us come and fairly reaſon the Caſe one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Further, Sixtly, God earneſtly deſires that they <note place="margin">6. Would <hi>have</hi> us conſider. Deut. 32. 29.</note> would but conſider of things, in <hi>Deut. 32. 29. Oh that they were wiſe, that they underſtood this, That they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their latter end.</hi> Now when you have to deal with them that are humorous, if you by the ſtrength of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have power over your own paſſion you would be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to expreſs your ſelves thus, Oh that I could but find <note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſuch a man in a way of reaſon, that he were but wiſe, that he would but weigh things! thus God ſaith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his people, Oh that they were wiſe and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and underſtood things!</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, God pleads with them after the manner <note place="margin">7. Pleads with them.</note> of men, in <hi>Jer. 2. 35. I will plead with thee, becauſe thou ſaieſt, I have not ſinned; thou art Righteous in thine own thoughts.</hi> Come, I will plead with thee, and convince thee ſaith God. As now, If one wrongs you, and they will not acknowledg that they have wronged you, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſome are of turbulent ſpirits and they will make them know that they have wronged them by caſting them into priſon, and by Law; but God he doth not do ſo, but he pleads the Caſe with them.</p>
                  <p>And then in the laſt place, The Lord will appeal to <note place="margin">8. Appeals to their own conſciences.</note> their own conſciences whether they have dealt well with him, yea, or no; he will make them to be the Judges; in <hi>Iſa. 46. 8. Remember this, and ſhew your ſelves men:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 48. 8. illuſtrated.</note> 
                     <hi>bring it again to mind, O ye tranſgreſſors:</hi> do not be led on like beaſts in your paſſion and humor, ſhew your ſelves but men, and do but remember, and think of it, I will leave it to you to Judg, and ſo, <hi>Judg between me and my Vinyard;</hi> and then again, <hi>Are not my waies equal, and</hi>

                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:43340:39"/>
                     <hi>your waies unequal?</hi> Now all theſe expreſſions are to ſhew how God did draw them with the Cords of a man in a rational way.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>In a gentle way:</hi> As if God ſhould ſay, I have not driven them on with rigor, but I have dealt gently with them like men: indeed if ſo be that one ſhould be alwaies ſtriking a youth, or ſervant, or man, you would be ready to ſay, you are not medling with a beaſt, <note place="margin">2. How God deals gently with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> or a dog, but with a man; ſaith God, I remembred I have to deal with a man, and therefore I dealt in a gentle way. There are theſe ſix or ſeven particulars, how God expreſſes his dealing with them in a <hi>gentle way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As firſt, I have ſuted my ſelf to their verie diſpoſitions, <note place="margin">1. Sutes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to their diſpoſitions.</note> this is now to deal in a gentle way; as a Schoolmaſter he looks upon his Scholers not as a company of beaſts, but as the children of men, and therefore he conſiders their diſpoſitions and tempers, and he ſutes himſelf with their temper, (if he be a wiſe Schoolmaſter) and will draw them on with ſuch waies and Cords as are ſutable <note place="margin">Simile</note> to humane Nature. So I do ſaith God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I have obſerved when they were in the beſt <note place="margin">2. Obſerved when they were in a <hi>good</hi> temper.</note> temper, and have ſought to work upon them then, I have obſerved what their diſpoſitions are; but now though men and women are of ſuch and ſuch diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet alwaies their good humor doth not work. If you that are wives will deal with your husbands like men, obſerve when they are in a good temper, and then deal with them and ſeek to draw them; God doth ſo; I <note place="margin">Wives</note> obſerved when they were in the beſt temper of all, and then I came upon them with the moſt ſtrength, to draw them at ſuch a time rather than another.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I gave them time to conſider; though they were never ſo untoward, yet I did not come inſtantly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">3. Gave them time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</note> them with blows, but I gave them time to conſider, to bethink themſelves: many Scriptures we might ſhew for either of theſe: you do not give beaſts time to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:43340:39"/>
Now when you fly upon others preſently without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> them time to conſider, you deal not with them like men but beaſts.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I have hired them to obedience by my gifts; <note place="margin">4. Hired them to obedience.</note> I do not only in an imperious way command them to obey, or elſe look to it at your peril, but I have come and hired them to the waies of obedience, and gave them gifts to draw them, and ſo I dealt with them like men.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, I have had conſideration when they did not <note place="margin">5. Diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> obey, whether it were through weakneſs or wilfulneſs, when they were diſobedient, I did not make it all one whether they diſobeyd through weakneſs, or wilfulneſs, and ſo I dealt with them accordingly.</p>
                  <p>And then Sixtly, In all afflictions that was brought <note place="margin">6. Afflicted in meaſure as their natures might bear.</note> upon them, I conſidered that they were but men of weak natures, and could not bear much; I did not lay on as if I were laying on upon an Ox, or ſuch a creature that had ſo much ſtrength to bear, but I conſidered they were men, and I laid on my ſtrokes gently conſidering that they had tender natures: as you know the Prophet ſpeaks in <hi>Iſa. 57. 16. I will not contend for ever, leſt the ſpirit that I</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 57. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>have made ſhould fail before me.</hi> The Lord looks upon the weakneſſes of his people, and therefore will not contend, leſt their ſpirits ſhould fail before him.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, In their afflictions, I was ſenſible of their <note place="margin">7. was aflicted in al their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. Iſa. 63. 9. Simile.</note> afflictions as well as themſelves; ſo you know what the Lord ſaith, <hi>In all their afflictions I was afflicted,</hi> I was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: ſo as a tender Father, or wiſe Maſter, if he doth ſtrike the child or ſervant, the very blows in a manner will be as ſenſible to him as to them: but it is not ſo with you when you ſtrike a beaſt. So ſaith God, I did not afflict them, but it went to my very heart, and I was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted as well as they. <note place="margin">3. How God drew his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable way.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>I drew them with the Cords of a man;</hi> that is, in an <hi>honorable way,</hi> ſo as that honor and reſpect that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43340:40"/>
was any way due to ſuch a creature, or that was ſutable to ſuch a creature it was preſerved.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>My Inſtructions was ever more than my blows,</hi> I never ſtruck more blows than I gave them Inſtructions, <note place="margin">1. Inſtruction more than correction.</note> if I ſtruck them one blow, I gave them twentie, fourtie inſtructions to one blow. When you have children or ſervants, and perhaps you will give them fourty blows to one inſtruction, you deal with them not like men, but like beaſts. That's the firſt. It's a diſhonor to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, for any Superior to give more blows than inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but I dealt with them like men, ſutable to that reſpect that is in a kind due to humane Nature.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Whatſoever ſpark of ingenuity remained in them,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Preſerved their ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> 
                     <hi>I took care to preſerve it;</hi> that's the ſecond thing; If there were but a ſpark of ingenuitie in any of them I took great care to preſerve that ingenuitie, and not to quench that ſpark in all my dealings towards them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>I aim'd at their good as well as mine own, as well</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. Aimed at their good in all.</note> 
                     <hi>as my glory;</hi> there's many Scriptures that way; you do not do ſo when you ſtrike beaſts, you do not conſider of the good of the beaſt, but at the benefit that you ſhould have, that he may further your work. But now when you come to ſtrike men you muſt look at their good as well as at your own good; there's no parent muſt ſtrike the child, but muſt look at the benefit of the child rather than to ſatiſfie his humor. When you ſtrike meerly for your own advantage without aiming at the good of thoſe you ſtrike, you deal not with them like men, but like beaſts.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>I did never any thing towards them but ſo as they</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. Stil held forth hope of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                     <hi>might have hope ſtill preſerved in them of being reconciled to me upon their coming in,</hi> though they deſerved never ſo much, and I ſeemed to come againſt them the moſt harſhly, yet I never ſo came againſt them but there was hope preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that at any time of their coming in and repenting I would be reconciled to them; this is to deal with them
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43340:40"/>
like men, when you deal with any that offend you <note place="margin">Admonition to parents and governors.</note> (parents or Governors) never be ſo harſh, but though they be very evil, there muſt be preſerved ſom hope that upon their coming in they be reconciled to you.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, <hi>I was careful to maintain their honor as my people,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5. Kept up their honor.</note> (that is) in all my dealings with them, though they were hard ſomtimes to fleſh and blood, yet I put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them and other people; other people were to me in compariſon but as dogs (as it were) but theſe as men, and as free men, in <hi>Jer. 2. 14. Is Iſrael a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 2. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>is he a home born Slave? why is he ſpoiled?</hi> What, Iſrael a ſervant, a home-born Slave! no, he muſt be look'd upon as a free man. So in <hi>Iſa. 27. 7. hath he</hi>

                     <hi>ſmitten him, as he ſmot thoſe that ſmit him?</hi> No, I look upon them with ſome different reſpect, and as men, and as Free-men, and deal with them ſo.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, <hi>Whenſoever they began to return, I met them half</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6. Met them half way.</note> 
                     <hi>way;</hi> I did not ſtand it out to the uttermoſt to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage their hearts, but I met them half way in all their returnings. And did not God deal honorably with them? Indeed if you would deal in a contemptuous way with another that hath offended, you will ſay, Let them wait; yea, but if we will deal with another in an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <note place="margin">Simile.</note> way, if we ſee him but in coming a far off, we will run and meet him, as the father of the prodigal did; ſo ſaith God, I did not deal with them in a contemptuous way, but I drew them with the cords of a man, and in an honorable way I dealt with them. Thus you have this expreſſion opened, <hi>I drew them with the cords of a man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now there are divers Obſervations from hence:</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, <hi>That the waies of God are very rational, ſo</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>that they may draw any man of underſtanding to love them:</hi> If mans nature were not degenerated, were it that we did but ſtand right in regard of our principle of Reaſon, it were impoſſible but the waies of God ſhould draw us, at
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43340:41"/>
leaſt to an outward obedience to them; there's no reaſon in your waies, but there's reaſon in Gods waies, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you had but the hearts of <hi>men,</hi> though you had not the hearts of <hi>Saints,</hi> yet to approve of Gods waies, at leaſt: and for an outward conformity to them you might be drawn; if men were not beſotted with their luſts, certainly they would never be ſo confident in their ſinful waies as they are, if men did but bethink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the way of God. Saith <hi>Solomon, When thy people are carried away captive, and ſhall bethink themſelves:</hi> there is ſo much reaſon in Gods waies, that if one did but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think <note place="margin">1 King. 8. 47. obſerved.</note> himſelf: Saith <hi>David, I conſidered my waies, and turned my feet unto thy teſtimonies.</hi> Oh! it's a great mercy <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> to have a conſidering heart; and it's a great judgment of God to leave men and women to a ſlight and vain ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, not to weigh and ponder things; moſt people are led on in a continued hurry of paſſion, like to the Horſe in the Battel, and no man ſaith, What have I done? Oh! couldeſt thou but have ſo much power over thy paſſion, and the violence of thy luſts, as to get alone and weigh Gods waies, ſurely thou couldeſt not but be convinc'd that the waies of God are better than thy waies, they are ſo rational.</p>
                  <p>The Second Obſervation is this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The way to prevail with men, it is to deal with them in a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi>

                     <hi>way;</hi> the way that I took with this people to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them, it was, <hi>to draw them with the cords of men:</hi> Certainly the way that God takes to prevail with people is the beſt way.</p>
                  <p>Therfore thoſe men that would prevail with any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">Uſe</note> to bring them to any thing that they deſire, tis to deal with them in a rational way, and ſo ſeek to prevail with them; the Spirit of God doth ſo, in <hi>Joh. 16. 8.

If you that are Miniſters would ſpeak power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to people, ſpeak in demonſtration, the demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit indeed it muſt be, there is a ſpiritual Reaſon in the Scripture; Miniſters muſt not think to ſcare <note place="margin">Miniſters muſt <hi>convince,</hi> not <hi>ſcare</hi> men.</note> men into the waies of Godlineſs, though I know ſome times God makes uſe of the bare terrors of the Law; but the main thing whereby Miniſters muſt have hope to do good to their people muſt be by preaching convincingly, to overcome their very reaſon as much as poſſibly can be, and to ſet the Law of God ſo before them as if they will but judg between God and their own ſouls, they ſhall condemn themſelves, and approve of God. That Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry is like to be the beſt Soul-ſaving Miniſtry, that meets <note place="margin">The moſt convincing Miniſtry the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</note> with every objection of their hearts, and at every turn the ſecrets of their hearts comes to be opened; Oh! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you preach to men and therefore you make uſe of that reaſon that you find in Scripture: I know reaſon alone will never do it; I, but God when he works to the ſalvation of ſouls, he works upon them after the manner of men, and therefore the Miniſters of God that are Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workers with God, they ſhould work in ſuch a ſutable way.</p>
                  <p>And not only Miniſters, but Majeſtrates too, they <note place="margin">Majeſtrates <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43340:42"/>
Equitie and Juſtice, there Majeſtrates need not ſtay for any further convincement, and there (I ſay) they need go no further, but they may deal with them in a violent way if they break thoſe; but in all things that are of a more dubious nature, and that are from connexions, and conſequences, and more difficult to be underſtood, and that are controverſal even among godly men, and wiſe men, there they muſt look to it, and people muſt have waies of inſtruction firſt, and to be informed firſt, and likewiſe if they do not oppoſe them in a wilful way, but if they ſee that they do deſire to underſtand what they are able and cannot, they muſt not think to go on in a way of violence there, that is not to deal with men <hi>like men</hi> in that thing, to force them unto ſuch waies that they do not ſee reaſon for, and let them labor to the uttermoſt they can, they are not able to underſtand, then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there muſt be forbearance in ſuch things; and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the rather, becauſe that Chriſt hath given us charge, not to yeeld to any thing in matter of Religion till we do underſtand the rule of it; <hi>Whatſoever is not of faith, is ſin;</hi>

humanity, let men have ſome humanity in them, that is, let them be <hi>Courteous;</hi> to be courteous, and to ſhew huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity we uſe for al one; ſo that the nature of men, though it be fallen, yet if it be not twice dead, and overcome by its corruptions exceedingly.

                     <note place="margin">Uſe 1.

No, it raiſes it higher; and therefore ſeeing there is ſomething left in mans nature of Gentleneſs, and Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſurely thoſe that have Grace, and have a principle to curb corruption, they ſhould have much Gentleneſs, and Fairneſs with them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Seeing that theſe are the Cords of men <hi>[Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs]</hi>

Did not God gain upon your <note place="margin">And why?</note> hearts in a gentle way? however, if God did come in a harſh way to your apprehenſions at firſt, yet know, there is no ſuch diſtance between you and your neighbors, thoſe that are under you, your children, or ſervants, as there is between God and you; therefore it is for you to deal with your fellow Creatures in a gentle, fair way.

                  <p>And never chaſtife Children nor ſervants but with greef, and put a difference between weakneſs and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in your Children and Servants, and let your hand be heavie upon them only upon meer neceſſity, when all other means are tried, never but then let your hand be heavie upon them: Thus you ſhould do with thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you, as God deals with his people, with the Cords of a man, gently. <note place="margin">3.

As now, if you can bring gifts to a man you can quickly blind his eyes: we <note place="margin">Evidenced.</note> have found theſe cords of men, we have found that mans nature loves gifts, and thoſe in the place of Juſtice if they have bribes and gifts brought them; Oh! thoſe are the Cords of men, thoſe are ſutable to their natures indeed.

                  <p>And then the ſecond Bond of Love is: <hi>I choſe you, and your ſeed alſo:</hi> And this was a great mercie; If I had <note place="margin">2.

                  <p>And then the third Twiſt: <hi>I ſet my heart upon them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi>

                  <p>Seventhly. <hi>I gave them my Oracles,</hi> the Revelation of my <note place="margin">7. Gave them his Oracles.</note> Will. This was another notable fruit of the love of God to this people; <hi>In Judah was God known: his Name was</hi>

                  <p>And then the Eighth Twiſt (as I may ſo ſay) in this <note place="margin">8.

                  <p>And then Ninthly, <hi>I gave them a Law, the ſum of which</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">9. A law of Love.</note> 
                     <hi>was nothing but love:</hi> (as I opened the laſt day, That the Law of God had ſtrength of Reaſon in it, and ſo God drew them with the cords of a man, his Law was ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.) So I drew them with bonds of love, I gave them a Law, the ſum of which was nothing but love, as thus: What's the ſum of the firſt and ſecond Table of the Law? The ſum of the firſt Table it is, <hi>Thou ſhalt LOVE the Lord</hi>

                  <p>For Firſt, Love it is in its ſelf a lovely thing to behold, <note place="margin">1.</note> there's an amiableneſs in Love to draw the eye and the heart to it: In <hi>Cant. 7. 6. How fair and how pleaſant art thou, O Love, for delights?</hi> How fair and how pleaſant is <note place="margin">Cant. 7. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Love?</hi> Take Love for the affection of love, it is fair and pleaſant for delight; and when the beloved is called by <note place="margin">illuſtrated.</note> the Name <hi>[Love]</hi> it ſhews that Love is very amiable, and very beautiful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:43340:48"/>
Secondly, Love it hath much ſweetneſs in it, much <note place="margin">2.</note> power to inſinuate its ſelf into the heart: As we know baſe love, adultrous love it hath a great deal of power to inſinuate into the heart: in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 26. the hands of the whoriſh woman are called bonds: If whoriſh love hath <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7. 26. obſerved.</note> ſuch power ſo to inſinuate and to be bonds, much more then hath <hi>True Love,</hi> Cracious Love.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Love it is generative, Love hath a great ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerative power to beged Love. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is no</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. Nulla eſt major ad amorem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocatio, quam praerentre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mando. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>greater provocation to Love, than to begin to love.</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Magnes amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris amor.</note> Love can draw iron hearts. Love, it is the Loadſtone of Love, it will draw Love, and beget Love where ever it is.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Where Love is got into the ſoul it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands all, it commands all the Faculties and Underſtanding where Love is got. Look what a man loves, ſo according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his underſtanding will work: It a man loves his ſin, <note place="margin">Love com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands al the ſouls faculties</note> his underſtanding will be working for his ſin; Oh what ſubtil Arguments will men have for their ſin when they love it! any way that a mans heart is engaged in Love he will be very ſubtil to argue for it. So on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when once the Lord hath taken the heart with Love, this Love commands the underſtanding, and then all reaſonings are for God, and the ſoul it hearkens after no reaſonings that are againſt God, or againſt his waies, when once the heart is taken with Love. If a mans heart be taken with love to a Woman, he will hear nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her; but if his love be taken off from her, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very report that he hears againſt her he will aggravate to the uttermoſt he can, and will ſoon beleeve it. So it is, when a mans heart is taken with the things of God, and of Religion, it will hear nothing againſt them; but if a mans heart be off and do not love the waies of God, then they are glad if they can hear any thing that makes againſt them. Love commands all the Faculties of the Soul, the Underſtanding, and the Thoughts, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Will, and Affections, it commands the Body,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43340:48"/>
it commands the Eſtate, it commands the Liberties, it commands all that a man hath, or is, or can do. Love hath the abſolute commanding power of all, Oh! Love hath ſtrong Bonds.</p>
                  <p>And again, Love it makes every thing that is done for <note place="margin">5. Makes all ſervices de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful.</note> the beloved to be delightful; It doth not only command to do a thing, but it makes it delightful, <hi>I will reſt in my love and rejoyce over them with ſinging,</hi> ſaith God. When the heart is once taken with love, (I ſay) it doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do that which is good for that which it doth love, but doth it with delight.</p>
                  <p>And then, Love knows not any bounds, it never ſets <note place="margin">6. Hath no bounds.</note> its ſelf any bounds at all, but would do, and do, and do, and do even infinitly for that it doth love, ſo far as love prevails no bounds are ſet.</p>
                  <p>Yea, and when it doth much, it will not be wearie <note place="margin">7.</note> neither. So far as the Soul is acted with Love, it will never be wearie with what it doth. Men that love their paſtime all night they will ſit up at it and never be tired; ſo thoſe that love the waies of God, though the fleſh may <note place="margin">Caution.</note> be weak, yet not the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>And then, Love it is ſtrong, ſo as it ſtands out againſt <note place="margin">8.</note> all oppoſitions, nothing that doth oppoſe can prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt love: in <hi>Cant. 8. 6, 7. Love is as ſtrong as death, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Song. 8. 6, 7.</note> 
                     <hi>many waters cannot quench the fire of love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then in the next place, Love, it rejoyces in <hi>ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">9. Rejoyce in ſufferings.</note> not only delights in <hi>doing,</hi> but delights in <hi>ſuffering.</hi> If one that loves another ſhall ſuffer for him that he doth love he will rejoyce in thoſe ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, Love, it ſuffers not its ſelf to be its ſelf (as <note place="margin">10. Seeks not its own.</note> it were) to be at his own diſpoſe. Love doth wholly give its ſelf into the poſſeſſion of him that it doth love, it is not his own no longer; The heart that is once taken <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> with love is no more its own, but gives its ſelf into the poſſeſſion of that that it doth love: ſo that put all theſe together, and you may ſee that love it hath ſtrong Bonds.

                  </p>
                  <p>And then a Second Note of Obſervation is this; <hi>Let us do as God doth then;</hi> that is, Labor to caſt the Bonds of <note place="margin">Obſ. 2.</note> Love upon thoſe we have to deal with; it's Gods way to his people to bind them to himſelf, to throw upon them Bonds of Love, And then ſaith God I have enough, I have them ſtrong enough if I get them with the bonds of Love. Oh let us do as God doth, labor to draw people with bonds of Love; If you would draw any to you, let it be by Love, do you deſire to draw any to you, you <note place="margin">Miniſters du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to open Gods love.</note> that are Miniſters, eſpecially you are appointed to draw others to God, it's your work: what ſhould you do? open the Love of God to them, preſent the Grace of the Goſpel to ſouls, labor to work upon their hearts by all the mercies of God, By the mercy of God tendered to them, by the mercy of God received by them, beſtowed upon them: There's no ſuch way to draw ſouls to God as this. <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand,</hi> that's the preaching of the Goſpel. The firſt preaching of all <note place="margin">Mark, 1. 15. applied.</note> Chriſts Sermons, and of his Diſciples was, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Oh! Sirs, look about you, Conſider your waies, there's a glorious Kingdom now at hand, a Kingdom of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and mercy wherein the glory of the Grace of God comes to be revealed to the children of men in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way than ever formerly. This is the way to bring men to repentance. It's true, it's good to uſe all means, to ſhew the greatneſs and the juſtneſs, and the holineſs of God, and the like; But the <hi>prevailing argument</hi> above all to bring men to repentance it is, <hi>That the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand;</hi> and indeed we would do ſo if we did conſider that repentance it is a Goſpel Grace, it is not that <note place="margin">Repentauce a grace of the Goſpel, not of the Law.</note> that comes by the Law, the Law takes no notice of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, but the Goſpel, and therefore to preſent the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43340:49"/>
Love of God as it is in the Goſpel, ſo there God manifeſts his love to the children of men, and that's the way to draw to repentance; there's a notable ſtory that we have in the book of Martyrs, not far from the beginning, as <note place="margin">Book of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, lib. 1. <hi>Euſeb.</hi> lib. 3. cap. 20.</note> alſo in the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of <hi>Euſebius:</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle that did commit a yong man which was very hopeful unto a Biſhop, to take care of him; but afterwards proved to be very wicked, and got among a company of theeves, and ſo came to be the Captain of a company of theeves and robbers, and was wholly bent to ſlaughter, and murder, and extream cruelty, and lived in the mountains: Afterwards <hi>John</hi> comes to this Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop to whom he had committed the yong man, and bid him reſtore unto him the charge which he and Chriſt had committed into his Cuſtody, then the elder looking down with a heavy countenance, ſobbing and ſighing, ſaid, He is dead. <hi>John</hi> enquiring how, and what kind of death, he anſwered he is dead to God, for he is become the Captain of a company of theeves in ſuch a place. The Apoſtle then rending his garments in great ſorrow, ſaid, Prepare me a Horſe and let me have a guide, and ſo rode in poſt, being come unto the place he is taken by the theeviſh watch, he neither flieth nor reſiſteth, but ſaith, for this purpoſe came I hither; bring me unto your Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, who being armed beheld him coming, but when he knew that it was <hi>John,</hi> he was ſtrucken with ſhame, and fled away. The old man forgetful of his yeers pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth him flying, and crieth: My ſon, why flieſt thou from me thy father, unarmed and old? O ſon! tender my caſe, be not afraid, as yet there remaineth hope of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I will undertake for thee with Chriſt. And thus he runs after him crying that yet there was hope of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and pardon, and that he would die for him. He hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this, firſt ſtood ſtill, turning his countenance to the ground, next ſhoke off his Armor, then trembled for fear and wept bitterly, ſo that this broke his heart and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43340:50"/>
back and falls a weeping upon the neck of <hi>John,</hi> and became an eminent Chriſtian afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever is to be thought of this ſtory, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there's no ſuch bonds as the bonds of Love to draw the hearts of people unto God. Have you to deal with ſtony hearts? the way it is to lay them upon the ſoft pillow of the Goſpel, and ſo you may break them; lay a ſtone upon a ſtone, and ſo it goes from you and doth not break, but if you lay it upon a pillow you may preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Simile.</note> break it with a hammer. The Word is compared to a hammer, yea, but we muſt labor to lay the hearts of people upon the pillow (as it were) of Love, upon the Grace of God in the Goſpel, and that's the way to break their hearts; there are none ſo bound to God as thoſe that are bound to him by Love, thoſe that are bound to God by fear, that hath not Love mixt withal, their bonds will not hold, they will ſeek quickly to break the bonds of fear; there's no men (I ſay) that are held to God by the bonds of fear but they will ſeek after any occaſions to break thoſe bonds, and if they can but get any oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to get themſelves out of thoſe bonds, they will, and commonly at laſt they do break them and get them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of the bonds of fear: but now thoſe that are held by bonds of Love, they are held for ever unto God.</p>
                  <p>I beſeech you obſerve this Note, <hi>When men caſt off the ſweet of their ſin, by the ſweet of the Love of God, then they will never return to their ſin again.</hi> Oh! but if it be only the bitterneſs of the Law, of puniſhment, that makes them caſt off ſin, they will be ready to turn to their ſin again, as a dog will return to the vomit, as a dog caſts out the vomit meerly in regard of the pain he doth feel; but <note place="margin">Simile.</note> when it is caſt out by the ſweet of Love, when one ſweet enters for another, ſuch hold on their way. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath a notable expreſſion for that in the 9.

you may come to have any liberty in their hearts that you would, you may ſay what you will if once they be perſwaded that you love them, then you may ask more liberty to reprove any thing that is evil in them, and to perſwade them to any thing that is good, then they take nothing ill from you; and therefore 'tis a great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that men of ſowr and bitter ſpirits have in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <note place="margin">A ſowr diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition doth diſadvantage much.</note> their own deſigns; if they once ſpeak any thing though never ſo good, yet it is rejected, becauſe that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple think it is not out of Love: But on the other ſide, it is a mighty advantage that a ſweet and loving diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath, let ſuch an one ſpeak never ſo, though the thing be never ſo harſh, yet the party will take it wel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knows he loves him.

                  <p>Theſe bonds of Love that here we have in the Text the Devil ſeeks to break, the great deſign of the Devil it is, to make men to have hard thoughts of God, &amp; his waies, <note place="margin">Satans great deſign.</note> and to make them beleeve that God hates them, and that though they have ſome good things from God for the preſent, yet that the heart of God is not towards them, and ſo labors to make a ſeparation between the ſoul and God. And ſo the great deſign of the Devil is to break the bonds of Love between Chriſtian and Chiſtian: It was a fearful judgment that we reade of in <hi>Zach.</hi> 11. 14. when <note place="margin">Zach, 11. 14.</note> the ſtaff that was called <hi>Bonds</hi> was broken, even the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood between <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he threatens it as a Judgment; <hi>I'le break the bonds of brotherhood.</hi> And then

you find that the <hi>ſtaff of Beauty</hi> was broken when the ſtaff of bonds was broken.</p>
                  <p>My brethren, never was the bonds of Love more broken among Chriſtians than they are now. We reade of bands of Love, but what's become of them? They are broken. They were in former times ſo twiſted (as I told you the word in the Hebrew ſignifies) love ſo twiſted into ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">The love of Chriſtians one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> formerly compared with our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions now.</note> Wreaths as one would have thought they could never have been broken; but whatſoever the matter is, we find they ſnap aſunder.

God hath cut the Cords of divers of our yokes aſunder, and hath broken the bonds of the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, and now behold we break the bonds of Love; Oh! unworthy wretches that we are, every one of us looks with a jealous eye one upon another, every one ſhifting for himſelf, there are no bonds of love in our hearts; the wicked in Scripture are ſaid to <hi>die without bonds,</hi> that's Gods patience, that they ſhall die without bonds; but wo to us, we live without bonds, and that's our ſin, and the wrath of God upon us, in <hi>Eccleſ. 3. 8.

ſurely there's a great deal of want of love amongſt us, that when men in the uprightneſs and ſincerity of their hearts ſhall deſire to find out the mind of God, and the will of God, and meerly out of conſcience becauſe they dare not go any further than they ſee the mind of God to go before them, therefore they ſhall be judged to be a ſtiff-necked people, and to be the great hinderers of Reformation; Is this the beſt interpretation that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly can be made of things? Is it not poſſible why there ſhould be ſome other grounds why they differ from their brethren, but meerly ſtiff-neckedneſs? how if it ſhould be owned by Jeſus Chriſt at the great day, That it was out of ſincerity, becauſe they did deſire to know the mind of Jeſus Chriſt fully, and yet they could not ſee what their brethren ſay they did? We ſhould make the beſt interpretation of things that poſſibly we can.

thoſe brethren that do differ, they may be conſciencious in their way, and do it out of zeal to God, and to what they apprehend to be truth; We ſhould apprehend one another ſo, if we ſee there be nothing elſe wherein they do manifeſt corruption of heart but meerly in their <note place="margin">Caution.</note> waies of difference in their judgments and opinions. Now if both could but thus judg each of other, that they both are upright in what they do purſue: One ſide imagins that our part is Gods mind, and the other ſide judges that that party is Gods mind; let us judg now that they do it in uprightneſs except it apperrs ſome other way, then we ſhould quickly come to cloſe and joyn hearts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, if we had ſuch upright opinions one of another, therefore the more it is the deſign of the Devil to break <note place="margin">We ſhould countermine Satan.</note> thoſe Bonds of Brotherhood, and of Love, the more ſhould we labor to unight together.</p>

husband by love, &amp; ſo to gain his heart to me, and upon that we live ſo lovingly together, Chriſtianity teaches me to perform the duties of a wife to my husband, though my husband be an Heathen. I verily beleeve there are <note place="margin">Godly cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for want of love live worſe than when one yoke-fellow is carnal oft-times.</note> many godly men and women, that ſometimes when the one is godly and the other is wicked. You will ſay, How can that be? Yes, though there be godlineſs, yet there may be ſuch frowardneſs and paſſion as may cauſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful diſturbance: but on the other ſide, where there is godlineſs and love, there is ſuch an overcoming with Love, that though the man be wicked and never ſo harſh, yet he hath the nature of a man in him, and ſo long as he hath the nature of a man in him he will be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by Love, and therefore that's the way to bind men and women together; Would you be united more than ever yet you have been? labor to caſt the Bonds of Love one upon another; let the husband ſtudy how to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome his wife with love, and ſo the wife the husband, and then there will be a ſweet union indeed: and ſo for Maſters and ſervants, there ſhould be Love there to unite one to another, though the maſter be above the ſervant, <note place="margin">The diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance betwixt Chriſt and us greater than betwixt us &amp; our ſervants.

                     <hi>David</hi> the King ſtood up, and he ſaid, Hear me my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and my People; he did not ſit down Majeſterially and ſay, My People, and you that are my Subjects, and that are under me, I command you to do thus and thus; but he ſtands up unto them and ſaith, Hear me my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, my People: This was a way to gain the hearts of people unto him. You know <hi>Abſolom</hi> he ſought in a falſe way to ſteal away the hearts of people by a gentle carriage. I remember I have read of <hi>John</hi> the Second, a <note place="margin">John <hi>2d King of</hi> Portugal</note> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> he choſe his Emblem to be a <hi>Pelican,</hi> that he might expreſs his love to his Subjects upon this ground; for the <hi>Pelican</hi> when her yong ones have been <note place="margin">The property of the <hi>Pelican.</hi>
                     </note> bitten with Serpents, ſhe feeds her yong ones with her own blood, and thereby cures them: now upon this, this King of <hi>Portugal</hi> chuſes the <hi>Pelican</hi> to be his Emblem, thereby he would teſtifie his readineſs to let out his blood for the good of his Subjects, for the healing of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. He would not feed upon his Subjects blood, but he
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43340:54"/>
would rather let out his own blood for their good. This is the commendations of a Prince, not to ſeek to feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Subjects blood, and to raiſe up his Honor, and Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative by his ſheding of their blood; but to love them <note place="margin">A Princes pattern.</note> ſo, as to be willing to let out his blood for their good if it might be. The maxim that ſome have labored to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe into Princes, <hi>I had rather be feared, than be loved;</hi> it is <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Timeri quàm diligi.</hi> A pernitious ſtate maxime</note> a maxim only beſeeming Tyranny, and no way ſutable to an ingenuous ſpirit, but to a baſe and ſordid ſpirit; Certainly that man, be he what he will, that is acted by that principle, is a man of a ſordid and low ſpirit: a man of a generous ſpirit, and of an ingenuous ſpirit would rather be beloved than be feared: Let every man <note place="margin">The evils of ſtriving o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than by love.</note> ſeek to gain another by love: If you ſtrive otherwiſe to gain any but by love;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, You are not likely to prevail.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If you do prevail, there will be ſo much trouble before you do prevail, that it will not be worth the having when you do prevail.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When you have your will upon them, they do the thing that you would have them, they dare not do otherwiſe; I but they hate you though: What good is this, for a man to have his will upon another, if in the mean time he hates him?</p>
                  <p>Then Fourthly, If you do not prevail by love, They will do no more than juſt needs muſt; and this is the <note place="margin">Why Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites are hide-bound towards God</note> reaſon indeed why Hypocrites do ſo little for God, God hath never gained their hearts by Love, but only by fear, and therefore they will do no more for God than they muſt of neceſſity; whereas (as I ſaid before) love never propounds bounds.</p>
                  <p>And then Fiftly, If you do not get them by Love, they watch for all opportunities to fling off. Now what a poor gain is this, to gain one with a deal of trouble, and for him to do what I would have him, and yet to hate me, and to do no more than needs muſt, and then to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43340:55"/>
wath for all opportunities to appear againſt me? Where fore my Brethren, for the cloſe of this Note, let us fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after <hi>Love,</hi> and provoke one another to <hi>Love,</hi> you will find ſweetneſs in your own Love, and ſweetneſs <note place="margin">The benefits of love.</note> that you get by Love, in the very exerciſe of Love you will find ſweetneſs, and then the Love that you get by others you will find that ſweet, and you will find it ſo much the ſweeter becauſe you get it by Love.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>You have heard that Love hath bonds; And then you have heard that we ſhould do as God doth. And then Thirdly, Is this Gods way? Oh! let us make uſe of all the Love that ever God hath ſhewen unto us for to gain our hearts unto himſelf.</p>
                  <p>And this would be a large Theam to ſpeak of, if we ſhould lanch into it; if I ſhould come to open unto you what the Love of God hath been to you, how much Love God hath ſhewn to the Nation, and to our ſelves for the gaining of our hearts, Oh the many twiſts of this Cord! 'tis a ſtrong Cord indeed to bind us to God. In <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 13. <hi>If thou ſhalt diligently love the Lord thy God;</hi> there's <note place="margin">Deut. 11. 13.</note> that that he requires of them, after what he hath done for them. If thou wilt but diligently love the Lord thy God. That's that that God ſeeks by al his love, to work our hearts to Love.</p>
                  <p>Not to ſpeak now of the Love of God to you as you are <hi>Creatures,</hi> nor as you are <hi>Men;</hi> But a little to ſpeak of the Love of God to you as you are <hi>Saints.</hi> I ſhall ſhew you very briefly what ſtrong Cords of Love God hath caſt upon you, to gain your hearts to himſelf to love <note place="margin">The cords of Gods love to his people, 1 Eternal.</note> him.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, <hi>Gods Love to you</hi> (if you be Saints) <hi>it is eternal Love,</hi> before ever you were born the bowels of God yer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned towards you, (as I may ſo ſpeak with holy reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.)
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43340:55"/>
God was twiſting theſe bonds of love from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity that he might gain your hearts, God was thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that in ſuch a time there ſhall be ſuch and ſuch men and women that ſhall live upon the earth; I'le make <note place="margin">Gods <hi>thoughts</hi> from eternity concerning his Elect.</note> preparation by ſuch bonds now as ſhall unite and faſten them cloſe to my ſelf when ever it comes to be revealed to them. It was love from eternity, Oh! the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions that were between the Father and the Son from all eternity for to manifeſt love to your ſouls! the great Counſels (I ſay) that were tranſacted between the Father and the Son before the world was, were about theſe Bonds of Love to you.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It's choiſe Love,</hi> when he left many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, <note place="margin">2 Elective and ſeparating. Malach. 1. 2.

                  <p>So wert not thou of ſuch a Familie? and yet thou ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt how God hath caſt off a great part of that Familie, and yet hath he loved thee?

It's choiſe Love, and therefore this might gain thee to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is free Love,</hi> the Love of God is free; ſo you <note place="margin">3 Free. Hoſ. 14. 4. Deut. 7. 7. diſcourſed.</note> have it in <hi>Hoſ</hi> 14. 4. <hi>I will love them freely:</hi> and in <hi>Deut. 7. 7. The Lord did not ſet his love upon you, nor chuſe you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you were more in number than any people: for you were the feweſt of all people.</hi> God there would manifeſt his love to his people to gain their hearts to him: ſaith he, The Lord did not ſet his love upon you, becauſe you were more: (Why then did God ſet his love upon us?) in the 8. verſe, <hi>but becauſe he loved thee.</hi> It's a ſtrange arguing: The Lord did not ſet his love upon you becauſe you <hi>were more,</hi> but the Lord did ſet his love upon you, becauſe he <hi>loved you;</hi> he could go no higher. There can be no other
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43340:56"/>
reaſon why the Lord ſhould love you, but <hi>becauſe he did love you.</hi> We uſe to ſay, it's a womans reaſon to ſay, I will do ſuch a thing, becauſe I wil do it. Now if any of you would have a reaſon why God loved you: why thus, He loved me, becauſe he loved me. The Lord did not ſet his love upon you for this reaſon; but he did ſet his love upon you, <hi>becauſe he loved you.</hi> So, it is a free love. Oh! let the freeneſs of it be another Ingredient, ſo as to bind your hearts unto him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>God hath ſo loved you, as he gave his Son for you.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4 He gave his Son for them</note> So God loved us. Sometimes it hath been in the thoughts of men whether there might not he more worlds than this world. Certainly God in his infinit power he might make a thouſand worlds more glorious than this, ſuch worlds, as the meaneſt Creature in thoſe worlds might be as high in excellencie above the Sun, as the Sun is high above a piece of earth. But now this we may know, let there be never ſuch excellent Creatures made, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have a greater fruit of love than mankind hath from God; Oh! this is the love of God to mankind, this cals aloud to the children of men to love God, here's a fruit of love beyond that which is to Angels; for the Lord <note place="margin">Which he did not for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</note> took not upon him the Nature of Angels, but the Nature of man.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, God ſo loved his people, <hi>as he hath given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5 And Himſelf alſo.</note> 
                     <hi>too, as well as his Son.</hi> Not only given the Second Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Trinity, but <hi>Himſelf.</hi> He doth not think enough to give Heaven and Earth to thee to be thy Portion, but he will make <hi>Himſelf</hi> to be thy portion, he will be thy God.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43340:56"/>
as it might be, yea, ſo as grace doth enlarge the hearts of the Saints, ſuch a ſoul would ſay, Lord, what will thou give me, if thou giveſt me not thy Son, if thou gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt me not thy Self? though I be leſs than the leaſt of thy mercies, yet except I have thy ſelf to be my protion, this is not ſufficient for me. Well ſaith God, That thou maieſt know that my heart is ſet upon thee for good, I'le give thee my Son, I'le give thee my ſelf and my Spirit. Oh! what love is this to the children of men, that ever we ſhould live to have our ears filled with this ſound from Heaven, that God ſhould do ſuch things as theſe are for the children of men!</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, God doth ſo love his people, as in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <note place="margin">6. Regards no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe.

Oh the Love of God unto his Saints!</p>
                  <p>Yea further, God hath loved thee ſo, <hi>as he hath pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">7 Pardoned all their ſins. Revel. 1. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>all thy ſins;</hi> here's another twiſt of Gods Love, in <hi>Rev. 1. 5. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto him that hath loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins, by his own blood.</hi> For his giving himſelf for us that is in <hi>Gal. 2. 20.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:43340:57"/>
dear as his own blood, he loves you; the Love Jeſus Chriſt broke through theſe difficulties, for when there were ſuch tranſactions between the Father and Son about redeeming the Soul, ſaith God, If thou wilt take upon thee to deliver them from their ſin, thou muſt come thy <note place="margin">A repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the love of Chriſt in coming to take away our ſin.</note> ſelf and be made a Curſe for their ſins. What, will you undertake ſuch a thing as that, to deliver them from their ſin? it will coſt you thus much. Saith Jeſus Chriſt, Lord, thy will be done in it, yet let me deliver them from their ſin, though I loſe my life, though it coſt me my blood, though I be made a Curſe, whatſoever it coſt me, yet let their ſins be waſhed from them. He hath waſhed us from our ſins, though it coſt him his blood. Oh! the Love of Chriſt to his Saints! what Bonds of Love have we here! I have ſeen ſome that they may twiſt and bind their cords <note place="margin">An apt ſimile.</note> the more faſt, they will wet them that ſo they may cloſe and bind the more. Oh the Cords of the Love of Jeſus Chriſt, are wet with his own blood.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Loved thee,</hi> ſurely his Love hath been great, he <note place="margin">8 Puts loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon them.</note> hath put lovelineſs upon thee, he hath put upon thee his own Nature. If one can ſay any thing greater than hath been ſaid, this one would think ſhould be very high and great, tor God ſo love us as to put his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into us, to make us partaker of the Divine Nature, ſo to love us, as to put his own Life into us, to enable us to live the very ſame life that himſelf doth live, ſo to love us as to put his own Image upon us, Oh! this is the Love of God to his Saints.</p>

We kept down all ſuch things, we could eaſily curb theſe, when we had power; but you ſee what extravegancies there are, how men run wild aſſoon as our power is taken from us.

our yoke this day, and laid meat before us too; my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who would have thought four years ſince, that there ſhould be Civil Wars for almoſt four years together in our Land? and ſuch cruel bloudy Wars, and ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpreading the Kingdom as they have, and that yet we ſhould at this day have proviſion ſo plentiful as we have? Did not all ſay, even at the firſt year when the Wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, Surely things would be very ſcarce? many began to lay in Corn and other proviſion, and we had cauſe enough to have feared it; but behold the bountifulneſs of the love of God, that hath eaſed our yokes, and hath laid meat before us, that the poor is ſatisfied with bread, there is no complainings in our ſtreets; we have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our bread, but our Tables fi'ld; What difference do you ſee upon the Tables of men now from that they were in former times? If a ſtranger ſhould come into this Kingdom, hearing what miſerable Wars there hath been, as bloody and cruel as in any Kingdom, and yet come to ſee every mans Table ſo fill'd, he could not but ſtand and wonder; Certainly ſtrangers think our condition to be far more ſad in reſpect of proviſion than it is; let's not be wanton with our plenty: we were wont to ſay, if we might have but Bread and Cheeſe and the Goſpel it were good cheer. Now my brethren we have outward food, and the Bread of life too. What, Is this ſweet, to be freed from outward bondage, and to have meat laid before us? how ſweet is it then to be freed from ſpiritual bondage, and to have the food of life laid before us? yet this is our condition. Our bleſſing is ſpecially in having our ſpiritual yokes taken off from us, and having the Bread of Life laid before us in a more plentiful meaſure then ever we had; Was there ever a time that this City <note place="margin">The miſery of other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, cy. mer</note> had ſo much meat laid before it for the ſoul as at this day? the miſery of other parts of the Kingdom is your mercie; the Lord grant that you do not loath your Manna, and deſpiſe it, God hath waies enough to cut you ſhort.</p>

                  <p>My Brethren, it's a great mercy of God to take mens <note place="margin">Uſe.

                  </p>
                  <p>It was a verie ſtrange perverſeneſs to think of this ſhift, to go back to <hi>Egypt,</hi> why was not <hi>Egypt</hi> the place of his

bondage, and the Egyptians ſtill retained their cruelty, and yet they thought of this help that they would turn to <hi>Egypt</hi> rather than to God.</p>
                  <p>From whence the Obſervation is, <hi>A ſtout heart cares</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>not whither it goes, rather than it will return to God.</hi> As the Prodigal will rather go to the Swine to feed upon husks, than to his father; like ſome ſtout children, they care not what miſeries they ſuffer rather than they will come and humble themſelves to their parents, They will hang themſelves, and drown themſelves, and ſeek their fortune (as they uſe to ſay) rather than be perſwaded to come in and ſubmit themſelves; No, never as long as they live, though they die, yet they will not, and thus their hearts are ſtout, and while they think they are ſtout a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their parents they are ſtout againſt God too, yet God hath waies to bring mens ſtout hearts to yeeld.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>A ſtubborn heart though God be in any way of mercy, God calling them to waies of mercy, yet if any thing</hi>

                  <p>Oh! thus it is with many of us, how fooliſhly, how <note place="margin">Uſe for <hi>England.</hi>
                     </note> wickedly have we thought and ſaid it was better with us heretofore then now, let us return to our former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition! This is thy folly and thy deſperat wickedneſs; But ſaith the text, <hi>He ſhall not return,</hi> though he thinks of returning; as if the holy Ghoſt ſhould ſay, do not pleaſe your ſelves to think it is but to return to <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:43340:69"/>
you cannot be worſe than now you are, for God hath worſer things for you.</p>
                  <p>And my brethren, this is our caſe this day, let not us think of returning to our former condition, certainly if we ſhould take ſuch a courſe to return to our former condition, we ſhould be far worſe than we were before, our danger would be far greater; this is certain, to the view of any men that have their eyes open, that our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Englands</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition muſt be far worſe, if it think of returning.</note> in <hi>England</hi> muſt either be far better than it was, or far worſe than it was: There's many ſay, Oh! we were thus and thus in former times, and if we were but as we were, we ſhould do well enough; Oh! let's not think of that, we muſt certainly either be far better, or far worſe than we were, for if we think of returning it will not be to <hi>Egypt,</hi> but to <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> which will be worſe.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth Note is this, <hi>God knows how to croſs wicked</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>men of their wills, to ſpoil them of their plots;</hi> they pleaſe themſelves with this and the other thing, they will do thus and thus, if they be put to this ſhift then they have a ſecond, and a third, yea, but there's a God in Heaven that hath determined otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>Never were wicked men more croſs in their plots than they are at this day; They have ſaid, that they would do thus and thus, but God hath ſaid they ſhould not, and they have not done it.</p>
                  <p>Now God in his <hi>Mercy</hi> croſſes his people of their wills that are ſet upon ſin; but when the wicked are croſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſin, it is, becauſe God hath other waies to bring about greater evils to them, To bring them to <hi>Aſſyria.</hi> Well then, whatſoever any mans thoughts and deſires are, the Lord deliver us from turning into <hi>Egypt</hi> again. And likewiſe the Lord grant the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> may not be our King. It follows.

For people to have ſuch a ſtout heart, armed with power, raiſed with pride, enraged with cruelty to reign over them, how ſad and dreadful condition are thoſe in? This is that the Lord threatens here; and why? Becauſe they refuſed to return.</p>
                  <p>I beſeech you obſerve this; ſaith he, <hi>They ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to</hi> Egypt, <hi>but the King of</hi> Aſſyria <hi>ſhall reign over them; becauſe they refuſed to return.</hi> From whence the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If we will not do Gods will, God will croſs us of our own.</hi>

Fooliſh men who will preſume to croſs God in his will, when God hath them at ſuch infinite advantages to croſs them every way in every thing! If you croſs God in that he delights in, you may expect God will croſs you in that you moſt delight in.</p>
                  <p>Oh! when you are croſt in your minds in any thing <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> that you have ſet your thoughts and heart moſt upon, reflect upon your own hearts and think thus; Have not I croſt God in his mind, in that which God hath ſet his heart and mind upon?

                     <hi>with their conſciences.</hi> When their conſciences puts them upon the waies of God, they think, There is good in <note place="margin">The conflict of conſcience &amp; corruption.</note> Gods waies, they think that God is not well pleaſed in the waies that they are in, they think it might be very well if they did reform their way; yea, but then on the other ſide, there comes in temptations, I but there are ſuch difficulties in the way, I ſhall diſcountenance ſuch and ſuch great ones, I ſhall have oppoſition by ſuch and ſuch, in that they will be diſpleaſed, I ſhall hazard my ſelf, and the like, I muſt deny my ſelf in many things, I muſt go againſt the hair in theſe and theſe things, I muſt croſs my heart in ſuch things that my heart is ſtrongly bent upon, why may I not do well enough in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way without ſo much trouble to my ſelf? And thus their hearts reaſon within them, and yet again at other times they have ſerious thoughts begin to work, and their conſciences begin to ſtir again, but have not I to deal with a holy and glorious God? how if things ſhall prove otherwiſe than they are apprehended by me? what good will it do to me to cozen my own ſoul? were it not better for me to return? [Oh! that I could but tel how to ſpeak this day to ſuch as are perhaps yet in ſuſpence, it may be there are ſome here this day that are in ſuſpence in their own thoughts, they cannot be quiet in that way that now they are in, when they awake in the night ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon their conſciences trouble them, and yet when they come abroad among company then that carries them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way again, and thus their lives do as it were hang in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence, and are vext and troubled in their own thoughts, not knowing what to do; Oh! that I could (I ſay) ſpeak to theſe hearts this day, that I could but tell how to preſent ſome determining thoughts to ſuch as theſe
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43340:77"/>
that are in this ſuſpence: I'le but in a few words preſent four or five Meditations to ſuch that may help them to determine, to come to a determination; for the truth is, This is the cauſe almoſt of all the wickedneſs of ſuch as <note place="margin">Suſpence a cauſ of much evil.</note> live under the means, that have enlightned conſciences, They do not come to a full determination: If thou beeſt in ſuſpence, let me caſt into the ſcale theſe thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Theſe ſtirrings that are now upon thee, that <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Conſiderations</hi> tending to ſettle the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>waies</hi> of God.</note> put thee thus to oppoſe the waies of ſin, and to bring thee ſo far as to be in ſuſpence, know, they are the work of the holy Ghoſt in thee, take heed of ſinning againſt the holy Ghoſt; I do not ſay, that all going againſt ſuch ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and workings is, <hi>The ſin,</hi> that <hi>unpardonable</hi> ſin; but this I ſay, the ſinning againſt thoſe ſtirrings and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of thy conſcience is <hi>A ſin</hi> againſt the holy Ghoſt, take heed of ſinning againſt the good Spirit of God; The holy Ghoſt hath begun to conceive in thee, take heed thou doeſt not deſtroy the child in the womb. We know it's murder to deſtroy a child in the womb, when it is but <note place="margin">Simile.</note> beginning to be conceived; And thou that art in this ſuſpence, thou haſt a conception of the holy Ghoſt in thee; take heed of murdering of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the Spirit of God leaves thee after this, thou wilt be more hardened than ever; let this be in thy thoughts; Thou haſt ſtirrings of conſcience, and ſome propenſion to the waies of God, but yet thy corruptions hang off, look to thy ſelf while theſe workings of God are upon thee, if they leave thee, they will leave thy heart harder than ever it was.</p>
                  <p>And then Thirdly, Take this Meditation, When thou art about matters of infinite conſequence (as now thou art) certainly, <hi>the ſafeſt way is the beſt way;</hi> 'tis not enough for thee to ſay, <hi>it is neceſſary,</hi> and why muſt I do thus and thus? and what need it? and may not I do wel enough without it? But when thou art reaſoning about matters that concern Eternitie, though thou canſt not
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:43340:78"/>
fully ſatisfie thy ſelf in this, or the other way, yet to take the <hi>ſafeſt</hi> way is the <hi>beſt</hi> way, and that thou art upon the ſafeſt way, it's enough to countervail what ever trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thou meeteſt withal; Though it ſhould not be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary that thou ſhouldeſt take ſuch a courſe in ſuch a particular, yet if thy conſcience doth but dictate to thee, that this way is ſafer than the other; it's the beſt way to go the ſafeſt way.</p>
                  <p>And the Fourth Meditation is this, <hi>That there is more evil in the leaſt ſin, than there can be good in whatſoever all the Creatures in the world can tender to thee</hi> Reſolve upon this: this is a certain principle that cannot be denied: There is more evil in the leaſt ſin, than there can be good in all that all the Creatures in the world can tender to thee.</p>
                  <p>And then Fifthly, <hi>That it is beſt for me to do that now, which I would wiſh I had done if I were now to die.</hi> Put that Meditation into the ſcale; Art thou in ſuſpence, hanging this way or that way, whether fully to come off of thoſe waies of ſin that thou art upon, or no? Put this Fifth thing into the ſcale, It is beſt for me now to do that that I would wiſh I had done if I were now to die: This wil be a mighty thing to weigh down abundance of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that may be put into the other ſcale; and ſo thou maieſt come to a determination.
<q>They are in ſuſpence.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The old Latin reads it, <hi>My People they hang in a kind of hope that I will return, and that all may be well with them at</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Populus meus pendebit ad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditum meum (i. e. pendulus ſperabit) <hi>vulg. Montanus.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>laſt;</hi> that though they do thus and thus, yet all may be well with them at laſt: God hath often delivered them out of great afflictions, and why may not he deliver them ſtill? And ſo they hang in expectation of Gods coming to them. So they make the word that is here tranſlated, <hi>[Backsliding]</hi> to be a <hi>returning,</hi> a <hi>returning of God,</hi> [They would have me to return firſt] And ſo I confeſs the word
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43340:78"/>
hath ſomething in it that ſignifies <hi>Returning:</hi> But thoſe that are skilful in the tongues ſay, It is not uſed in a good ſenſe, but in an evil; it's rather a <hi>going from,</hi> than a <hi>retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> But yet, as the old Latin hath it, The hope for Gods returning, and that things may be well, is the cauſe of the hardening of many hearts in the waies of ſin; they hang as it were in the Air, thinking that it may be well with them, and that things may not prove ſo bad as they hear: But curſed is that hope of comfort that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to ground upon, but only, <hi>that it may be things are not ſo bad as they hear out of the Word.</hi> But it follows;
<q>Though they called them to the moſt High, yet none at all would exalt him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Though they called them]</hi> That is, The Prophets and <note place="margin">Expoſ.</note> Meſſengers of God called them unto the moſt High, they wanted not means in the Miniſtry of the Word, they were called to the <hi>Moſt High,</hi> that is, to God. Now that God is <hi>The Moſt High,</hi> we have ſpoken to in Chap. 7. Verſ. 16. there he hath the title of <hi>THE MOST HIGH.</hi> You who are higheſt, look upon God as above you, know that God looks upon you, and all men that are lifted up in the pride of their own hearts, as infinitly below him.</p>
                  <p>God is the <hi>moſt high:</hi> Well, but, <hi>They called them out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the moſt high;</hi> that is, They called them in the Miniſtry of the Word.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That they might <hi>know</hi> him, that is, the <hi>moſt high,</hi> that they might know him to be the Infinit, Supream, High, Glorious, Majeſtie, that they might know the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite diſtance that there is between God and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that they might know him to be the Higheſt end of all things, ſo as to work after him as the moſt high.</p>

                  <p>That they might <hi>ſubmit their wills to him</hi> whoſe will is ſupream above all, and eſpecially in matters of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. <note place="margin">3.</note>
                  </p>

Whereas their hearts were d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oſſie, and low, and baſe, they minded only the ſatisfying of their fleſh, and having their wills one upon another, their hearts hung down to their deviſed worſhip, though the thing it was ſutable to their publick ends, and it was great wiſdom for them ſo to do, yet God would not own that, but did diſpiſe that worſhip of theirs that they thought to honor him withal, and the Prophets therefore called them from theſe baſe, droſſie things, called them to the moſt high God. The Note of Obſervation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Mens hearts they ſink down to low and mean things naturally;</hi> unworthy of their ſouls, unworthy of that <note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> excellent nature that they are indued withal: men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have ſwelling hearts in their baſe ſinful way, but this is their diſeaſe (this ſwelling) I ſay the heart of man wants a true elevating principle, the knowledg of the moſt high would raiſe them up higher than their pride <note place="margin">Piety raiſes the heart more than pride.</note> can do, the pride of man raiſes mans heart, yea, but that's their diſeaſe; but the knowledg of the moſt high would raiſe them up higher than their pride: but ſin whereſoever it is it doth debaſe mans nature.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It's the end of the Miniſtry of the Word, to call</hi>

Have not thoſe things ſounded in your ears, that have called you from vain things that your hearts were upon, telling you of the high God that you have to deal withal in all your waies, who will have to deal with you to all eternity? I make no queſtion but many of your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences have found this, have found a word darted into your hearts that hath called you from low baſe things to the high and bleſſed God.</p>
                  <p>And then Thirdly, <hi>It is a great and a ſore evil to ſtop our</hi>

                     <hi>ears againſt the calls to the moſt high God, againſt the calls of the word that calls you to the moſt high God; I ſay, to ſtop our ears againſt this is a ſore and a dreadful evil.</hi> What, not anſwer to Gods call! Doth God call you, and you not anſwer to him? We ſay to a child, Your father calls you, or to a ſervant, your maſter calls you, will you not anſwer? Oh! to ſhut our ears againſt the call to the moſt high <note place="margin">Simile.</note> God is a dreadful thing, it will lie heavie upon thee one day, thoſe calls thou hadeſt in thine ears will prove to be terrors in thine heart; Certainly, though thou letteſt go the calls of the Word to the moſt high God, remember this one Note, The calls that thou hadeſt to the high God being neglected by thee, will prove terrors in thine heart; poor creature, what is it that thou liſtens to? what invitations doth take thy heart, that the calling to the moſt high cannot overcome thee?</p>
                  <p>And then Fourthly: <hi>Their hearts are in ſuſpence, though they called them to the moſt high.</hi> From the connexion of theſe two we have this Note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the calling to the moſt high God is a ſpecial means to cauſe</hi>

                     <hi>exalted far above all Gods.</hi> What follows in the 10. verſe? <hi>Ye that love the Lord, hate evil.</hi> God is a high God above all Gods, hate evil then, ſet your ſelves againſt evil, be reſolved in the waies of God, for when you are called to the moſt high, by this you come to ſee how infinitely
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43340:80"/>
worthy God is of all glory from you, you may ſee by this what infinite good there is in this God, and that there is infinite power in this God to avenge himſelf of you, if you neglect his call, therefore there is a mighty deal of force to cauſe reſolution. In the 7. of <hi>Acts,</hi> we have a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſpeech of <hi>Stephen</hi> concerning <hi>Abraham. Abraham</hi> was called from his fathers houſe, and it cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined but that <hi>Abraham</hi> had many thoughts to keep his <note place="margin">Abrahams example.</note> heart in ſuſpence, when he was called from his kindred, and al the contentment and comfort he had there, it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but fleſh and blood would ſuggeſt many thoughts to <hi>Abraham</hi> to keep his heart in ſuſpence: But what took <hi>Abrahams</hi> heart off from ſuſpence, to reſolve fully what to do in ſuch a caſe? the text ſaith, <hi>The God of Glory appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Act. 7. 2. obſerved.</note> 
                     <hi>to him;</hi> it was not only God, but the God of Glory. My Brethren, when God is calling you off from all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comforts, from all things that may quiet your hearts in the world, and you have ſtrong temptations to keep you in the waies of ſin, let but the God of Glory appear to you, and this will take up your hearts, this will bring your hearts to a full reſolution. Oh! bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, bleſſed are thoſe ſouls though they have continued long in ſuſpence, yet at length the God of Glory appears to them, in the midſt of their doubts, and temptations, and hangings off.</p>
                  <p>And if there be ſuch a force in this, then learn to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> before thy ſoul that is in ſuch a ſuſpence, the Glorie of the great God, look up to this great God, 'tis the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite high God that I am called to; Oh! thou ſuſpending, thou wavering ſoul, look up to this moſt high, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this call of God unto himſelf, anſwer it thus;</p>
                  <p>Oh Lord, Thou art an <hi>Infinite, Bleſſed, Glorious</hi> Being, the <hi>Supream</hi> Being of all; I am a poor, vile worm that <note place="margin">A form of Anſwering to Gods call.</note> lie under thy feet, it's mercie that thou wilt vouchſafe to look towards me; thou <hi>mighteſt</hi> have let me gone on in baſe waies, and periſhed to all eternity without giving
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:43340:80"/>
me any call to thy ſelf; but now that thou ſhouldeſt give me a call to thy ſelf, the high and glorious bleſſed Lord, this is mercy; Lord, I come, and with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling fall down before thee ſaying, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? Thoſe who have been wavering and afterwards ſetled they have found that this hath <note place="margin">Note.</note> been the thing that hath ſetled them, ſome dreadful au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the high God that hath come to their hearts in ſome truth beyond what formerly he hath done, and this hath fully taken off their ſouls to him.</p>
                  <p>And then Fifthly; <hi>The true Worſhip of God is an eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>thing.</hi> Then are they called to the <hi>moſt high</hi> when they are called to the <hi>true Worſhip of God,</hi> for it raiſes the ſoul to the <hi>moſt high.</hi> Mens inventions are low things, are baſe and unworthy things, Oh conſider whether thou findeſt this in the Worſhip of God? doeſt thou find thy ſoul raiſed up to the moſt high in his Worſhip? thou doeſt never worſhip God aright, except thou findeſt in ſome meaſure thy ſoul raiſed up to the moſt high in his Worſhip; let no man look upon the Worſhip of God as a low mean thing; know, when thou art to come to worſhip God, thou haſt now to deal with the high God, whom Angels worſhip and adore; 'tis that God who is far above all Creatures in Heaven and Earth: thus thou art to look upon the Worſhip of God. Oh! how far are moſt men from this when they are worſhiping of God! very few there are that lift up their hearts to the moſt high; even in the duties of Worſhip. And ſo it follows in the words,
<q>None at all would exalt him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why, If God be the moſt high God, how can he be <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> exalted?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer: He is ſo high, as he cannot be more high <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> than Himſelf, God cannot be more excellent than he is
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:43340:81"/>
in Himſelf, God cannot make Himſelf better than He is, nor more glorious in Himſelf than He is: Therefore no creature can make him more than he is: all that all the Creatures in Heaven and Earth can do for God, can ad nothing to him: In <hi>Nehem. 9. 5. He is exalted</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>above all bleſſing and praiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet then God accounts Himſelf to be exalted.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When he is known and acknowledged for the <note place="margin">When we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt God.</note> High, Supream, Firſt being of all things, when we fear Him <hi>as a God,</hi> when we humble our ſelves before him as before <hi>a God,</hi> when we are ſenſible of the infinite diſtance there is between him and us, when we are willing to lay down what we are, or have, or can do for the furtherance of his praiſe, when his Will is made the Rule of all our waies, and eſpecially of his Worſhip, when we make him the laſt end of all, when 'tis the great care of our ſouls, and work of our lives to do what poſſibly we can that he might be magnified &amp; lifted up in the world, and when we account the leaſt ſin a greater evil than can be recompenced by all the good that Heaven and Earth can afford unto us; and now God accounts Himſelf exalted by us.

My brethren, If the bowels of Gods mercies ſhal work toward us, notwithſtanding our great ſins, why ſhould <note place="margin">Uſe. 1.</note> not the bowels of our compaſſions work towards our Brethren, notwithſtanding their infirmities? why ſhould we upon every little diſcontent caſt off all pity and love to our Brethren? What, ſuch great things in us, and yet moves not God to caſt us off, but ſtill, <hi>How ſhall I caſt thee off?</hi> Oh! when you look upon your Brethren that once your hearts did cloſe withal, and that were as your own ſouls, and if now you ſhould be any inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of evil to them, you ſhould have ſuch reaſonings as this, <hi>How ſhall I do it?</hi> I ſee infirmities in them, I, but notwithſtanding my great ſins, God ſaith of me, <hi>How ſhall I give thee up?</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Again, a Second Note is this: <hi>Sinners are at the very mouth of miſery, the brink of deſtruction when they think not of</hi>

God doth ſeem as it were to be at a ſtand, How ſhall I do to ſave theſe ſinners, and yet not to wrong my ſelf? Oh! this ſhould humble us for our ſins: As if a child ſhould do ſo much evil as to bring himſelf into ſuch bryars and <note place="margin">Simile.</note> troubles, as that his tender father being affected with his ſad condition would fain help him, but if he doth help him, he is put to abundance of difficulties for the helping of him, and he is fain to beat his brains, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy waies and means how he ſhall come to ſave this his child from utter undoing; now if the child hath any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity in him, he will not only think, it's no great matter, ſo be it I be delivered, Oh! but this will break his heart, Oh! what troubles have I brought my father into? It is thus with us in reference to God, if we look upon God thus as perſonating a man.</p>
                  <p>And then in the Fifth place, <hi>The ſalvation of a ſinner</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>it breaks through a great many reaſonings and workings of Gods heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How ſhall I do it,</hi> ſaith God? We little think what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings there are between Mercy and Juſtice about our lives, about our ſouls many times, could we but hear what reaſonings there are in Heaven between Mercy and Juſtice about our lives, Oh! it would go to our hearts: The great ſalvation that comes by Chriſt, it was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined without many reaſonings between Mercy and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:43340:88"/>
Juſtice, there was preſented to God whatſoever Juſtice could ſay, and what ever mercy could ſay; What (ſaith God) muſt my ſon be under my wrath for the ſatisfying of Juſtice, and be made a Curſe? yet this muſt be, Juſtice requires ſatisfaction, How can it be done without the Son of God being made a Curſe for mans ſin? theſe kind of reaſonings there are in the heart of God for ſaving of mans ſoul; in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 8. we reade of <hi>Abiſhai,</hi> and <note place="margin">1 Sam. 16. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Davids</hi> reaſoning the caſe about <hi>Sauls</hi> life; ſaith <hi>Abiſhai</hi> to <hi>David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                     <hi>this day: now therefore let me ſmite him, &amp;c.</hi> No, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> do not ſmite him, do not deſtroy him, and thus they reaſoned one with another; <hi>Saul</hi> was in a very ill caſe when there was that reaſoning about his life; ſuch a caſe are we in many times, the Juſtice and Mercy of God doth reaſon about our lives, and ſouls, Oh! how do we depend upon God for our lives and ſouls? and if we be ſav'd, we are ſav'd through many reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</p>
                  <p>But the main Point of all is this, <hi>That according to the relation that a people, a ſinful people, or perſons have unto God,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>So God finds it a difficult thing to execute wrath upon them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How ſhall I do it?</hi> The wrath of God is many times brought to the birth, and God cannot as it were (to ſpeak after the manner of men) know how to put ſtrength to it to bring it forth. This is the reaſon that in Scripture we have ſuch ſending after ſinners, and crying to them, to return, ſuch earneſt wiſhes, <hi>Oh! that they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn!</hi> and ſuch pleadings with them, They will not come in, and return; This is the reaſon why we reade of the Lord whetting his Sword, and bending his Bow, and preparing his Arrows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Why, is not God ready at any time to execute judgment upon a ſinner?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Queſt.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh no, he will be whetting, and bending, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:43340:88"/>
and all becauſe it is a work that he is loth to go through withal (as it were) and this is the reaſon why God will not ſtir up his wrath, or if it be ſtir'd up, he will call it back again. <hi>Lament. 3. 33. The Lord afflicts not willingly; neither doth he grieve the children of men;</hi> and all this is, becauſe Gods nature is to be merciful, mercy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <note place="margin">The Reaſon.</note> him, and the Lord doth perfectly foreſee, and hath perfectly in his view all the reaſons that might move him to mercy. As now thus: Theſe are the things that makes God to be at a ſtand when he comes to execute judgment upon a people, or perſons that have relation to him, where his Name is profeſſed, and where himſelf is <note place="margin">Other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> worſhiped.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, This reaſon is preſented, <hi>The many prayers of the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Prayrs of the Saints.</note> 
                     <hi>Saints withſtand againſt juſtice.</hi> Juſtice muſt break through all the prayers of all the Saints of God that are in ſuch places; and this is not an eaſie matter; we account it not an eaſie matter for to break through a mighty Army; God cannot come to a people that he is related to, and is worſhiped by, but that he muſt break through an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, <note place="margin">Simile.</note> the Army of the prayers of his people; now ſaith God, <hi>How ſhall I do it?</hi> Oh! it is a mighty Army that is between me and them.</p>
                  <p>Yea, Secondly, The Lord looks upon ſuch a place <note place="margin">2. The little ones.</note> with pity, <hi>Becauſe of the many children and little ones that there are in ſuch a place, yea, the children of his own people.</hi> You know when God was about deſtroying of <hi>Neniveh,</hi> he look'd upon the many thouſands that knew not the difference between the right hand or the left. But when God comes to deſtroy a Kingdom that doth worſhip him, he looks upon thoſe many infants, and the little ones, and ſees them many of the poſterity of his Servants; As they are but littles ones that moves his bowels, they have not been guilty of thoſe ſins that their parents have been guilty of, and they are the <hi>little ones</hi> of mine own precious Servants, many of them, <hi>How ſhall I deſtroy this place, even for their ſakes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:43340:89"/>
Thirdly, God conſiders <hi>that he hath but little worſhip in</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. Few worſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</note> 
                     <hi>the world,</hi> there are but few in the world that do worſhip him at all; and though it's true, there are ſuch mixtures in worſhip here, as in reſpect of that I cannot accept of what they have done, yet it is ſomewhat that I am wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped, there are very few in the world that own me to worſhip me at all.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>If ever God hath been honored in ſuch a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4 Former ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to God.</note> 
                     <hi>by his Saints, either by their doing or ſuffering, the Lord regards all this when he is about to draw out the Sword of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> It's true thinks God, there are but few that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor me <hi>now,</hi> but there are many of my Servants that have done much, and ſuffered much, how many have I that have ſtood out to witneſs for me, and my truth? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my Brethren, the Lord in ſaving any Kingdom when the Kingdom is in danger, if it be a place that he hath been honored in, and that his people have ſuffered much there for his Names ſake, then he remembers it; and there is not a louder argument next to the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, in the ears of God to ſave a place from ruin, than the blood of his people that have been ſhed for him; and therefore ſuch a place is beholding to all that have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>He accounts what number of his Saints are there:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5 A remnant of Saints.</note> There are yet ſome of them left; And would I have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Sodom</hi> if there were but ten righteous perſons? Now I'le reckon how many I have, not ten, or an hundred, but (it may be) God ſhall find thouſands of righteous perſons; now the blood of my Son that pleads for them, and therefore how ſhall I give them up?</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>I foreſee the miſeries they would endure,</hi> Oh! <note place="margin">6. Groans of the afflicted.</note> the very cries are in mine ears already, if I ſhould deliver them up into the hand of their enemies, Oh! the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity they would endure, how would they be plundered of all they have, put into priſon, put to miſerable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments! Oh! what ſhreekings and cries would there be,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43340:89"/>
even from my people that would worſhip me! And me thinks <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ears are fill'd already with their cries before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand. Many times when we ſpeak of the ſorrows and miſeries of people, before they come we are a little affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with them, but when we are eye-witneſſes of the miſeries of people; as if any of you have ſeen the woful miſeries of thoſe that have been under the power of the adverſaries, then your hearts would be affected indeed: but now all the miſeries that they ſhould endure are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent before God, as if they were now in real being, and therefore, <hi>How ſhall I give them up?</hi> And that's the ſixt thing that puts God thus to a ſtand, that makes it hard for him to give up a people that are any way related to him.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>The Lord ſees how the adverſaries would inſult;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">7 Inſulting of the Adverſary</note> If I ſhould deliver them, they will not honor me, they will blaſpheme, they will ſcorn at their prayers, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings, and at all their truſting in God, and at their good cauſe, and what's become of your good cauſe, and of your pretending to God, ſo much as you have done? Now the Lord foreſees theſe blaſphemies and inſultings of the proud adverſaries, how they will triumph, and tread upon his Saints as dirt under their feet.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, <hi>There are many of mine elect ones that are to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">8 Elect in the loins of their parents.</note> 
                     <hi>come out of their loyns,</hi> and therefore though I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Kingdom for their own ſakes, yet for thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ones that comes out of their loyns; If I ſhould deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them up to the rage of the enemy, then the line of my election would even be cut aſunder, and therefore, <hi>How can I give them up?</hi> I ſhall wrong my ſelf in this thing, in cutting aſunder even the very thread of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in giving them up.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, <hi>If my wrath and juſtice muſt be ſatisſied, let it</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">9 Other objects of wrath.</note> 
                     <hi>run out upon others,</hi> who will ſet the bryars and thorns before me that I may go through them and burn them up together.</p>

                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:43340:90"/>
Tenthly, <hi>If my Saints be afflicted, it will be my affliction;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">10. Gods own affliction.</note> It's true, they will ſuffer very much, but in an their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions I muſt be afflicted too; I foreſee what afflictions it will be to mine own Soul.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, <hi>I am bound to fetch good out of all their evils.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">11 God makes himſelf work</note> Suppoſe I ſhould give them up, yea, but then I muſt work for mine own glory, and fetch out good from all their ſnfferings; And will it not be as eaſie for me to be pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent towards them, as to work good from their ſufferings when they are given up? God reaſons in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>Twelfthly, <hi>If I deſtroy them, what glory ſhall I have?</hi> I <note place="margin">12.

                  <p>Yea, Laſtly, <hi>Why may not Mercy yet work upon their hearts?</hi>

in former times, as in 88. and the <hi>Pouder-Treaſon;</hi> I ſay, there have been the workings of the bowels of God towards us, a poor, wretched and ſinful people. And let us now learn to acknowledg whence our preſervation is; It is not from this man, and the other man, ſo much as from the reaſonings of the heart of God thus for good unto us.</p>
                  <p>Hence let us learn what to do when any temptation <note place="margin">Obſ. 7. For the reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to ſin, imitate God in the Text.</note> comes to any ſin: What, is it thus with God? doth God ſay when we are in danger of being deſtroyed, <hi>how ſhall I do this?</hi> Then when any temptation comes to us to ſin againſt God, Oh let us ſay, How ſhall I do this, and ſin againſt God? As <hi>Joſeph</hi> (you know) it was his reaſoning, when he had as fit an opportunity to fin as almoſt a man could have had, with his Miſtris, yet preſently comes there this reaſoning in his heart, How ſhal I do this, and fin againſt God? Oh! there is reaſon it ſhould be ſo with us, when God hath fit opportunities to deſtroy us, there comes the reaſoning of Gods mercy into his heart; ſo when we have our temptations to ſin, there ſhould com theſe reaſonings into our hearts, Oh! how ſhall I do this, and ſin againſt the Lord our God? Let us preſent al theſe reaſonings to our ſouls. Men wil gather reaſonings for their ſin: and ſo we ſhould gather al the reaſons that poſſibly we can againſt our ſins. It were <hi>well</hi> my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, if men after they have ſinned would ſay, Oh, what have I done? But it's <hi>better</hi> if men before they have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned would ſay, How ſhall I do it? Oh! certainly our mind: are very barren that we have not upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion when a temptation comes, reaſonings to move us againſt it; Indeed after a ſin is committed, men then can think of this reaſoning, and the other reaſoning, Oh! if God ſhould thus deal with us, Firſt deliver us up and and deſtroy us, and then God ſhould think of this and <note place="margin">God reaſons before, not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our evils are upon us.</note> that what might have been to have preſerved us, it would have been ill for us; therfore God, juſt when the danger

comes for our ruin, then he thinks of all that might keep off ruin from us: And ſo when the temptation to a ſin comes then ſhould we think of all things that might keep us from this ſin.

                  <p>The laſt Exerciſe we opened unto you this verſe, and made ſome Obſervations from it; to proceed now: The next Note is this,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is not the Image of God in any man to be prone to wrath, to delight in wrath, to be ſudden in, the execution of anger;</hi> when <note place="margin">Obſ. 8. Proneneſs to wrath, not Gods Image.</note> God comes to execute anger he cannot do it, but he muſt have a <hi>how ſhall I do it?</hi> before he doth it, he muſt make a ſtop: proneneſs to anger, ſuddenneſs to let out wrath, it is not the Image of God in any man or woman.</p>
                  <p>When any of you are about to do any thing, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt your Brethren, againſt thoſe that you have <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> relation to, be not over paſſionate, reaſon the Caſe firſt in thine own heart, <hi>How ſhall I do this?</hi> True, I think ſuch and ſuch they are in the wrong, but what good will come of it if I do thus and thus? Are they not thoſe that I have had ſweet converſe with, and experience of their godlineſs? would it not be more for the honor of God if I did forbear? will any good come to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick? ſhall not I rather ſerve the deſigns of the enemies with ſuch ſharpneſs and bitterneſs? will they not laugh and ſcorn at Religion? Oh! <hi>How ſhall I do this?</hi> Oh! when we have workings in our own thoughts as bitter as gall, if before we vent them, we would but put this to our ſelves, how ſhall I do this? with preſenting all the arguments that poſſibly we can to ſtop it, much good would come of it.</p>
                  <p>Yea, Miniſters when they are to preach, when they <note place="margin">Miniſters ſhould be wary in uſing tartneſs.</note> have prepared to deliver ſomething, yet if there will be any tartneſs in it, they ſhould think, how ſhould I do
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:43340:91"/>
this? what may come of it? I may vent my ſelf, but what good may come of it? what glory to God? what good to the Church? We ſhould make many pauſes, and many ſtops to our anger. As ſomtimes when you are tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veling abroad in the Country, you come upon ſome <note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſteep hill, you ſhall find that the Country men they lay here and there in ſeveral places ſomething to ſtop the Current of the water, for otherwiſe it would gore too much, if it ſhould run down ſwiftly, but when it hath ſome ſtop it doth not do ſo much hurt: Oh! how doth the anger of men gore deep; why? becauſe it runs hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and violently down, and it hath nothing to ſtop it. Men in anger they are very full of thoughts, and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and continually all the reaſonings of the hearts of men and women in their anger tend to nothing elſe but to heat their hearts more, all their thoughts work that way, till their hearts are made fiery hot, and ſo they burſt out and cannot ſtay, they muſe upon nothing elſe but that that may further their anger and diſpleaſure: And <note place="margin">The effects of Anger.</note> thoſe that are barren enough in their thoughts otherwiſe, yet are very quick in invention, and wittie for the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of anger and wrath. But this would be your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom had you the Image of God prevailing in you, when you find anger ſtirring in your boſom, you would rather muſter up reaſons that may allay your anger, that may qualifie it, you would muſe upon thoſe things that may ſerve to be a ſtop to it for the preſent, as God doth here: Oh! did men but do ſo, ſay, <hi>How ſhall I do this?</hi> what peace and quiet might we have among us!</p>
                  <p>A Ninth Obſervation is this; you ſee when God, though he threatned very ſorely, and charges deeply, yet, <hi>How ſhall I do this?</hi> He reaſons in his own heart for waies of mercy towards his people. The Note from it is this;</p>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Here's mighty encouragement for prayer;</hi> when we <note place="margin">Obſ. 1</note> preſent arguments to God for mercy, to think, that thoſe arguments we preſent, and all other that poſſibly may be preſented they lie glowing at Gods heart, they lie glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing warm at the heart of God; they are not only before God, but there they lie as a company of ſticks that are gotten together and ſo glow and are ready to flame out; ſo all conſiderations that any way may ſerve to do good unto the Saints, they do lie glowing at the heart of God <hi>altogether.</hi> It may be ſometimes we come in prayer, alas we are ſtraightned in our own bowels, perhaps we cannot expreſs our ſelves, it may be but in one or two particulars we are able to expreſs, and that which comes out of our hearts comes very cold; but when we are

ſtraigtned in our own bowels, and can expreſs but little for our ſelves, and if we ſee ſuch as belongs to Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, we muſt know that all conſiderations that poſſibly men and Angels can expreſs, that may do thee good they are all with God, and are in a heat in Gods heart. I do not know ſuch a full expreſſion as this is of Repentings <note place="margin">The Text re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable.</note> kindled; <hi>kindled together.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then Secondly, <hi>Let us gather as many arguments as we</hi>

                  <p>Oh! many of you, at ſome times you have one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Note.</note> that ſticks at your hearts, and at another time there's another; at ſuch a time there was ſome one truth darted in, and it took your hearts, and you would ſay as thoſe that went to <hi>Emaus,</hi> Did not we find our hearts burn within us? ſo you found Truths coming in at ſuch a Sermon, and at another, and another; yea, but now could you get but all thoſe arguments that ever God did dart into you to waies of repentance, could you but get them together, and work them upon your hearts, and never leave till they be kindled, and be crying to God as <hi>Eliſha</hi> did, till he got fire to come from Heaven to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Sacrifice: Oh Lord, my heart hath a deal of waterie ſtuff in it that will not kindle, till the fire of the holy Ghoſt come to kindle theſe arguments and make them to burn; Oh! if it were with us, as <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 31. ſaith he, <hi>While I was muſing, my heart was hot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

me, and the fire burned:</hi> ſo we ſhould go into our cloſets and be gathering all things together that we can to work upon our hearts, and continue mufing till we find the fire burning within us. Nay, our hearts heat ſo, as to break forth with our tongues, and even to ſay from our ſouls, Well, the Lord is God, it is he that is worthy for ever to be feared, and honored, and ſerv'd, I have lived like a baſe, and ſinful, wretched creature, without a God in the world, but it's the Lord that is God, that is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be honored, from my Bodie, and Soul, and Eſtate, and Name, and Liberty, and Life, and whatſoever I am, or can do; now if it would break forth in ſuch a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, how excellent would it be? Oh! let us be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled I beſeech you for the coldneſs of our hearts, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can kindle there; What a damp is there upon our ſpirits, that when any argument is laid it goes out pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently? We have Truths laid upon us when we come to <note place="margin">Note.</note> the Word, but our dampie hearts quenches them all, they do not kindle; many are wittie enough to gather arguments for ſin, and lay them upon their hearts, and ſo to kindle wickedneſs in their hearts, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. 6. <note place="margin">Pſa. 41. 6. Opened</note> you have a notable Scripture there of wicked men that came to <hi>David, They gathered iniquity in their hearts;</hi> all things that might ſute with their wicked hearts, and for the furtherance of their ungodly waies they gathered them together for the encouraging, and ſtrengthening of them in their evil waies: But it ſhould be the care of the Saints to gather all things that might further repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in them; That's the reaſon why wicked men are ſo hot in that that's evil, They gather arguments toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and hence it is that wicked men when they have been in wicked company they <hi>come from it ſo hot in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions</hi>

                     <hi>to ſin,</hi> Why? becauſe they have gathered a great deal together for the heating of their hearts in their ſin; and ſo ſhould the Saints when they are together in a holy communion and fellowſhip, they ſhould be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">or good.</note>

one from another, every one come and afford ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to lay (as it were) to kindle the fire, But how? laying their light ends together, and not their dead ends together.</p>
                  <p>And then the Third Note is this, <hi>Our mercies to others</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhould not be cold, but burning: Let us be merciful, as our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father is merciful:</hi> That is, Not only wiſhing good to others, but let there be <hi>kindled mercies</hi> in our bowels, that we may not be able to keep them in.

                  <p>The Obſervations:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When we have ſtirrings between Mercy and Wrath, the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Mercy ſhould rather prevail, the bent of our hearts ſhould</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>rather be in them.</hi> When we have workings this way and that way; which is the moſt benign ſide? the arguments had need be very much the ſtronger for wrath, than for Mercie; If the arguments have any equality, or neer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny equalitie in them, certainly the arguments for mercie ſhould prevail: they do ſo with Gods heart; Oh! be you like God in this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:43340:102"/>
And then Secondly, <hi>When there are ſtirrings with God, and temptations to draw to ſin, the ſtirrings for God likewiſe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhould prevail.</hi> Have not you found it thus many times in your ſelves? you have had ſtirrings in your hearts to ſuch and ſuch duties, and at the ſame time there hath been temptations coming to ſuch and ſuch ſins; now I put it to your Conſciences, as in the Name of God, Cannot you tell divers times how the temptations to ſin hath got the day? you have been rather carried from God to your baſe ſinful luſts, and your Conſcience hath been overcom; Conſcience hath pul'd, and drawings of the Spirit have been very powerful, but yet temptations have been more powerful, and you have gone that way; Oh! be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of this, that it ſhould ever be ſaid, That at ſuch a time there were ſtirrings with Conſcience and Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Temptations and Conſcience ſtirring together, yet that Temptation ſhould overcome Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Gods mercies do not free his People from all fruits</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>of diſpleaſure. [But I will not execute the fierceneſs of mine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.]</hi> And my brethren, this is not meant meerly of the times of the Law; for this anger of God upon them is to this very day? But yet it is not fierceneſs of anger, like that of <hi>Adamah</hi> and <hi>Zeboim:</hi> There are (no queſtion) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them the elect Ones of God at this day, God wil not have this called the fierceneſs of anger.</p>
                  <p>So, 'tis <hi>diſpleaſure,</hi> 'tis <hi>captivity,</hi> long captivity, They are a reproach, and a by-word to the world, and yet not fierceneſs of anger: Our diſcontented hearts are ready to call every little affliction, fierceneſs of anger; Oh! how fierce is God, if we ſuffer any little! And indeed did we but know what anger our ſins deſerve, we would learn, not to call every affliction that is upon us, no, nor our greateſt afflictions, <hi>fierceneſs of anger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>We ſhould acknowledge mercy, though we ſuffer</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>hard things;</hi> If yet we be not utterly, not everlaſtingly caſt off, acknowledge Mercy; it is Mercy my Repentings

                  <p>Learn we all this: This day whatſoever afflictions are upon me; though it may be you are ready to ſay, Such afflictions are upon me, as upon none; we are ready to think our afflictions to be the greateſt of all; yea, but bleſs God that thou haſt not fire from heaven to conſume thee and thy family, for this might have been thy porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this <hi>fierceneſs of Anger.</hi>
                     <q>I will not return to deſtroy <hi>Ephraim.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>God here compares himſelf to a Captain that comes <note place="margin">Expoſ.</note> with his Soldiers unto a Town: I ſuppoſe many of you in this place may eaſily come to underſtand the meaning of this word, by what they have ſeen and felt themſelves: Soldiers come to a Town, and there they pillage it and away they go, and ſo the poor people think, Soldiers have been here, and I hope we ſhall do well enough now, and think all's over: It may be within a month or two after, the ſame Soldiers come again, and utterly ruin the place, and ſtrip them of all. But now ſaith God, <hi>I will not return to deſtroy</hi> Ephraim, that is, Though I lay my hand upon them, and afflict them, and take away ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny comforts from them, yet when I have done that, there I'le leave, I will not come back again with a purpoſe ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to ruin them; This I might do, I might return up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them with one evil upon another, but I will not do ſo. From whence note:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is no cauſe that ſinners ſhould be ſecure when ſome evil is upon them, to think this is all, now they know the worſt:</hi> No, <note place="margin">Obſ. 5.</note> God may juſtly return upon them again and again; If thou turneſt not to God under thy affliction, God may juſtly return upon thee to ruin thee. Indeed if thy afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were ſuch as hath cauſed thy heart to return to God, thou maieſt then hope that God wil not return upon thee,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:43340:103"/>
but if ſo be thou behav'ſt thy ſelf frowardly under thy afflictions (I ſay) thou maieſt juſtly expect that God ſhould return upon thee.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, <hi>God is very gracious to his people when evil</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>is upon them,</hi> he will not ad, and ad, till he utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them, but he will forbear that he might have ſome ſubject for his Mercie, he will not contend for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For I am God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and not man.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Here's an argument that is very full, <hi>I will not execute the fierceneſs of mine anger, for I am God, and not a man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before God took upon him the perſon of a man in <note place="margin">Expoſ.</note> thoſe yernings of his bowels, that is, When he would expreſs his mercie, mark, there God would come in the moſt familier way to make us know the meaning of his mercy; but when he comes to ſpeak of <hi>Anger,</hi> there he would have us know that he is not like to a man in way of Anger; in the way of Mercie, ſaith he, if there be the moſt merciful man upon earth, know that I am like him; but when I come to anger, I am not like man in the way of anger: God is verie deſirous that we underſtand ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his heart in the waies of his mercy, but when he ſpeaks of the execution of his wrath, I will not do that, why? <hi>For I am a God, and not a Man:</hi> And mark the ſtrength of this expreſſion, the difference between God and Man in the point of the execution of wrath, you will find it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">The differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betwixt God and man in point of Anger. 1.</note> uſeful to you; Firſt for the opening of it, and then for the ſeveral Obſervations to be drawn from it.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, Man is of a weak ſpirit, not able to rule his anger, Man, if he be but a little heat with anger, it's turn'd into rage, and there's no rule at all; but I am not man ſaith God, I am God, I am no man, 'tis not with me thus, I am not of a weak ſpirit, I am able to rule my anger, in <hi>Nahum,</hi> 1. 6. the Lords anger there is ſaid to be furious, but I find the word in the Original, <hi>The Lord

                  <p>Thirdly, Man, many times becauſe he hath not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction within his own heart, therefore he is in a rage <note place="margin">3</note> with every body: Man flies upon others, not ſo much for any thing that they do, but becauſe of the diſquiet of his own heart; but I am a God and not man, I am infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly <note place="margin">Note.</note> Alſufficient of my ſelf, &amp; there is no diſquiet in me, all it at reſt and quiet within me, and this makes me to be of ſuch a quiet diſpoſition towards my Creature.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If there be any mercie in a man, it's but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <note place="margin">4.</note> little, a little matter will ſtop the current of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that is in man; but I am a God and not man, there is infinite mercie in me, an infinite current, and the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the mercie that is in me cannot eaſily be ſtopt, for I am a God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Man is of a fickle and an unconſtant diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">5.</note> but I am Jehovah and change not, and therefore the ſone of <hi>Jacob</hi> are not conſumed.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, If man paſſes by an offence, it is from ſome <note place="margin">6.</note> motives or ſome perſwaſions from without, if there be none of thoſe motive and perſwaſions from without, he is fevere, and he is ridged, but I am a God and not Man, I have enough in mine own heart to perſwade me, though there be no arguments from without, yet there's enough within me, in my own bowels to perſwade me, for I am a God.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Man he thinke it a diſhoner to him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <note place="margin">7.</note>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:43340:104"/>
reconciliation with thoſe that have offended him, what ſhall I go and diſgrace my ſelf to begin with my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior? let him begin with me if he will; this is mans diſpoſition; but I am a God and not man, I account it my glory to begin the work of reconciliation, there is not ſuch a diſpoſition in me as in man.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, Man, he cannot foreſee the conſequences that <note place="margin">8.</note> may follow upon his forbearing, or pardoning of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and therefore he is loth to forbear or pardon: But I am a God and not man, I have infinite wiſdom and can foreſee all conſequences that will come.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, Man, he cannot work good out of what ill <note place="margin">9</note> carriages there are againſt him, and that makes him not to forbear; but I am a God and not man, I know how to work out mine own ends, and for the glory of my Name out of all the ſins of my people.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, Man though he promiſes much mercie, yet <note place="margin">10.</note> oftimes, if thoſe that he promiſes meroy to do offend him, he will recal his promiſe again, and he thinks he may do it, and he makes all his promiſes but conditional; yea, but I am a God and not man, I do not ſtand ſo upon it, though I know beforeh and there will be many weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and infirmities is my creature, yet I have ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that are abſolute promiſes to thoſe that are my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Ones, and I will not recal my Promiſes though they be unfaithful and ſinful. Man doth not only recal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes when there is occaſion given, but many times through unfaithfulneſs. And therefore I remember <hi>Brentius</hi> an approved Divine, hath this More upon this place, The word (ſaith he) is <hi>Iſh,</hi> not <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo he <note place="margin">Brentius.</note> tranſlates it, <hi>I am a God; and not a Noble man;</hi> you ſhall not have ſuch dealings with me as from your great men, many great then make great and fair promiſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:43340:105"/>
and great men, how do they deceive the expectation of thoſe that are with them, eſpecially in their need, they leave them in the lurch many times; but I am a God and not man, you ſhall not have ſuch unfaithful dealings with me.</p>
                  <p>Further, If man forbears and paſſes by offences now, <note place="margin">11</note> he cannot have the offenders again at advantage when he pleaſes, and therefore he thinks he had beſt take the advantages now; Oh but I am a God and not man, my Creatures I have them alwaies at advantage; it's true, I can ſpare them now, for I can have them under my feet again, and again, and again, and therefore I have no ſuch reaſon to take advantage of my poor Creatures as one man hath of another.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I am God and not man; that is, Man he is bound to poſitive rules of Juſtice that are ſet to him, but <note place="margin">12.</note> I am a God and not man, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercie, and whom I will I harden.</p>
                  <p>The Obſervations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Goodneſs and mercy in God is that wherein he Glories:</hi> it's true, the Lord is high above man in all excellencies, <note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> but mark here how he glories that he is a God and not man in the point of execution of wrath: Many glory in their anger, and make that to be their excellencie, and their bravery, Oh they are brave men and of brave ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits when they can vent their wrath, when they can rail and ſpeak evil, and make others to come and ſubmit to them, and ſtrike or puniſh them, why now they are brave men, I'le make you do thus and thus: as in a Familie you ſhall have ſometimes a poor man or woman manifeſt abundance of pride of ſpirit as if they were Princes and <note place="margin">Maſters of Families.</note> Monarchs, they will do thus and thus, and you think your ſelves to be of brave ſpirits; but mark, God glories in this, that he doth not execute the fierceneſs of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>

                  <p>My Brethren, this Scripture (were there no other) ſhews <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> that paſſion and anger debaſes man, we have a notable Scripture for this, that God glories in his long ſuffering and patience towards his Creature, in <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 17. <hi>And now, I beſeech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording</hi>

Mark, this Scripture hath reference to the latter end of <hi>Exod</hi> 32. there God promiſed that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould ſee his glory, and in Chap. 34. God made his glory paſs by him, and what was it? The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering, and abundance in mercy and truth &amp;c. Now <hi>Moſes</hi> hath reference to this, <hi>Moſes</hi> laies hold upon this, as if he ſhould ſay, Oh Lord, was not there a time that I was pleading with thee? and dideſt not thou promiſe to ſhew me thy glory? and was it not the Lord long-ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion &amp;c? why now Lord manifeſt thy glory, now Lord ſhew thy ſelf to be a glorious God, in doing what? mark in the 19. verſe, <hi>Pardon I beſeech thee the iniquity of</hi>

                     <hi>this people:</hi> That's the glory that God ſhould ſhew forth, and manifeſt his power in it; one would rather think that the power of God ſhould rather be manifeſt in the deſtruction of ſinners; no, the power of God is manifeſt in Mercie as well as in miſerie and deſtruction: And we find that thoſe that come up neereſt to God, they are the <note place="margin">Neerneſs to God moſt merciful.</note> moſt loving and gracious merciful hearts, yet if they do but come neer to God ſo as poſſibly natural men may, to have but any magnanimitie, that's a little neerer to God than a baſe ſordid ſpirit, the magnanimouſneſs of <note place="margin">yea, if but in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralneernes.</note> of any mans ſpirit appears in his love and forbearance and meekneſs, and gentleneſs, for ſo we know the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens could ſay, The greater any one is the more placable

                     </gap>, the Lyon is a magnanimous Creature, therefore ſaith the Heathen, it's enough for to fall down before a magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous Lyon, but for Wolves and Bears they inſult over thoſe that falls down before them; So thoſe that have the moſt magnanimous ſpirits have the moſt patient ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and forgiving ſpirits, and pardoning ſpirits: This is as croſs a Note unto a carnal heart almoſt as any thing, I mean to one that gives way to the luſts of his paſſion, for he thinks himſelf only magnanimous when he can vent his anger; and were it not for the thought that he thinks he ſhould be a fool, he would forbear his anger; it is not thy honor, but it makes thee baſe in the eyes of thy ſervants, children, and wife, when thou co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt <note place="margin">Maſters of Families.</note> into thy houſe like a mad fool, it makes them look upon thee, and deſpiſe thee, when they ſee thee thus drunken in thy paſſion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Such are the provocations of God cauſed by ſin, that if God were like to you, ſinners could not be forborn;</hi> as if <note place="margin">Obſ. 2.</note> God ſhould ſay, The truth is, your ſins were ſuch as were not I a God, it were impoſſible that I could bear; for ſo it is (though we think not of it) the evil of ſin is ſo great that if all the patience that were in all the men that ever was ſince the world began were put into one man, if he knew the great evil that there is in ſin, he would deſtroy the world, he would not bear, if his heart were but holy, as here God ſaith himſelf.</p>

My Brethren, the looking upon God as a God, it would help againſt many diſcouraging thoughts in poor ſinners: as firſt thus, My ſins are very great;
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:43340:107"/>
Men will forgive little offences, but God is a God, and not man, and therefore great mercies are little in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon to him.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond diſcouraging thought is, I have ſinned againſt <note place="margin">2.</note> many offers of mercy; but God is God, and not a man, and Gods mercy is ſuch as brings in men that have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the offers of Mercy.</p>
                  <p>And then Thirdly, <hi>None is ſo ſinful as I,</hi> but God is a God, and not a man, and therefore he is above thee in the <note place="margin">3.</note> waies of his mercie, God hath more mercy yet than ever he did manifeſt to any one creature in the world, and though I be the vileſt of all ſinners, yet let me look upon God as a God, and not a man.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>I am unworthy (ſaith the ſinner) of any mercy from God.</hi> Indeed, if you had to deal with a man it might <note place="margin">4</note> hinder, but God is a God, and not a man, therefore 'tis not unworthineſs that hinders mercy in God, it is that mercy pleaſes him.</p>
                  <p>Yea, <hi>But I am like to be of no uſe to God.</hi> It's true, if you were to deal with a man, he might not be pleaſed, <note place="margin">5</note> but God ſtands in no need of you, or any of his creatures, for he is a God, and not man; thou doeſt not honor God, as a God, if thou doeſt not caſt thy ſoul upon his mercy, as the mercy of a God.</p>
                  <p>If I put this unto thee, I hope the glory of it will be ſo great as will keep it from being abuſed, What, doeſt thou think thy condition is grievous, but doeſt thou think that ſuch mercy would not ſerve the turn as this is that now I am naming, that thou ſhouldeſt have ſuch mercie as an infinite God ſhould therefore manifeſt, to <note place="margin">A ground of ſtrong conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, from <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6, 7.

that end that he might appear to men and Angels to all eternity, what he is able to do in the infinitneſs of his mercy, Would not this ſerve thee, and help thee, and heal thee? Now this is tendred to thee in the Goſpel, even this mercy is tendred to thee in Chriſt to be an object of thy faith; and the very preſenting of this is a work of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel that it might draw acts of faith, <note place="margin">The chief work of the Miniſtry.</note> for it hath a power to draw forth faith, yea, to beget faith, the very preſenting ſuch a thing as this is hath a quickneſs in it: It's true, if you look upon God only as a merciful man, this is no ſuch glory as the ſhining of it upon the ſoul will ad life; As now, the ſhining of the Moon, or a hundred Torches wil never beget life in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; but the ſhining of the Sun wil do it: ſo the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the mercy of God any other way but as a God, <hi>as a God in Chriſt,</hi> will never beget life in the ſoul, but <note place="margin">What is the imediate root of Faith.</note> look upon him in the infinitneſs of his mercy, whoſe thoughts of mercy are beyond ours as high as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are above the Earth, this is the way to beget faith. And therefore thoſe that cannot beleeve, they take very il courſes for themſelves, only to have their thoughts upon ſuch things as may diſcourage them, and they think that this is as pleaſing to God; but certainly the way to beget or raiſe faith in thy heart is, to look upon God as a God in the waies of his mercy.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but you will ſay, The truth is, this that you <note place="margin">Objects</note> ſpeak of, that God is a God, and not a man, is rather a diſcouragement to my heart, 'tis a God that I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt, and not a man; as one way it may encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me, ſo another way it may diſcourage me; <hi>Againſt thee, againſt thee only have I ſinned</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) Pſal.</hi> 51. And indeed, this is the moſt piercing thought in a true penitent heart, My ſin is againſt God, I have lived ſo long a time without a God in the courſe of my life, and I have ſtruck at God himſelf in my ſinful waies. Oh wretch that I have been! I have been guilty of the darkening of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:43340:108"/>
the glory of the great God in the world: Now I'le an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thee this in a word;</p>
                  <p>And is this that which doth aggravate thy ſin in thy <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> heart? does this work upon thy heart moſt, that thou canſt appeal to God, that of all the conſiderations of ſin that ever thou hadeſt in thy life, there is nothing grieves thee ſo much, as that it is againſt God? Becauſe God is ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſo infinitely worthy of honor from all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; be of good comfort, and take encouragement from this point, and mark what I am ſaying, and with that I ſhall cloſe all.</p>
                  <p>If the confideration of the glory of God above a man doth thus aggravate thy ſin to thy humiliation, then it will aggravate the mercy of God to thy conſolation as well; If thou workeſt this thought upon thy heart, Oh my ſin is againſt a God and not a man, and therefore my heart is humbled, then the Lord would have thee to make uſe of the conſideration of his glory as a God for thy comfort; God is a God, and not a man, in the way of mercy.

Indeed there is a great temptation in this, when we ſee a multitude go another way; the Devil prevails much to draw mens hearts to that way; But the ſtronger the temptation is, the greater is the commendations of thoſe that ſhall ſtand out; what though they be but a few, what though they ſee others for the preſent ſeem to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper, yet if thou canſt hold on in the way of truth, in the way of Gods Worſhip according to his Word, God looks upon this as a thing very pleaſing to him; it is a very great commendations to thoſe that do thus, and God takes it kindly from them: yet <hi>Judah</hi> doth thus, whatſoever <hi>Iſrael</hi> doth.</p>
                  <p>There were many evils, and that very groſs in <hi>Judah,</hi> but yet ſaith the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> here, <hi>Judah ruleth with God.</hi> Why? for the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> he was a Prophet to <hi>Judah,</hi> he was not ſent to <hi>Judah</hi> to enveigh againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> but to the <hi>ten Tribes;</hi> and therefore though there were many evils in <hi>Judah,</hi> he takes not ſo much notice of their evils, as of the evils of the ten Tribes.

                     <hi>Hierom</hi> upon this place tells of a Tradition that the Jews have here about <hi>Judahs</hi> rule, and it is this, faith <note place="margin">Jerom in loc.</note> he, When the people came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued them, and the red Sea was before them, the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains on either ſide, they were mightily terrified, yet God bad <hi>Moſes</hi> bid them go on, the people thought with themſelves, whither ſhall we go? and ſo were afraid. Now <hi>Judah</hi> had a ſpirit (ſay they) beyond the reſt, and was the firſt Tribe that ventured to go into the Sea, and from thence obtain'd to be the principal Tribe: This is but their Tradition.</p>
                  <p>But here the meaning is, <hi>Judah yet ruleth with God,</hi> that is, the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> yet continued according to <note place="margin">Expoſ.</note> Gods mind in the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and maintained the true Worſhip, and ſo ruled with God. There are divers excellent Notes further from hence:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That which men enjoy with God, though it be but a little, it is better than to enjoy much, and not with God;</hi> as <note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> thus; The Kindom of <hi>Judah</hi> was but ſmal in reſpect of the Kindom of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> yea, but <hi>Judah</hi> rules with God: To have a little with God, it's a great deal better than to have a great deal without God. As here in a Kingdom, <note place="margin">Few regard this.</note> ſo in an Eſtate, Haſt thou a little Eſtate, yea, but haſt thou it with God? Oh! it's a great deal better than to have a great Eſtate? and have much guiltineſs with it, and not to have it with God; <hi>Iſrael</hi> maintained their Rule by ſhifts, and that's a great evil; Though thou haſt thy deſires, yet if thou getteſt them, and doeſt maintain them by ſhifting courſes, that's a ſore and a great evil, thou <note place="margin">Shifts.</note> canſt have little comfort in the enjoyment of thy deſires; for this is the meaning of the Prophet, as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Iſrael</hi> rules, but how did they get and maintain their rule? it was in falſe, ſinful waies: It may be thou haſt thy will over thy brother, yea, but thou haſt it in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way, thou bleſſeſt thy ſelf in that thou haſt thy will, but thou haſt little cauſe if thou kneweſt all. <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not rule with God.</p>

And truly it is a very good diſcription of men that feed upon the wind, they ſeem big when they have no oppoſition, and ô, what they will do! they will do thus and thus, and great matters; but the truth is, no men are of more <note place="margin">None ſink lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer when diſappointed, than conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent men.</note> fearful hearts than thoſe men that are puft up with the wind of their own conceits, when God comes to croſs them, or they are call'd to ſuffer in the way that they go in, they will quickly turn to any colour, this way or that, becauſe they do but feed upon the wind, therefore they come to be feeble creatures, they have no ſtrength at all in them.</p>

My brethren, the Saints have better food to feed upon, that that makes them more ſollid, and more ſtaid, while the men of the world feed upon the wind of applauſe, upon their own conceits, and upon their own vain counſels and plots, and upon the creature, and think to fill their bellies that way; the Saints they feed upon the Mercy of God, upon Gods Al-ſufficiency, they feed upon his Word, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and upon the Covenant of Grace, they feed upon Jeſus Chriſt whoſe fleſh is meat indeed, and whoſe blood is drink indeed, and ſo they come to have ſtrength in them, for their food is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That's for <hi>falſe Doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then ſecondly, <hi>Thy encreaſe lyes and deſolation,</hi> that <note place="margin">2 Lyes againſt the Prophets.</note> is, lyes againſt the <hi>Prophets of God,</hi> againſt the <hi>Saints,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Waies of God.</hi> And certainly there was never the like multiplying as there is at this day in this ſenſe too, men carry their multiplying glaſſes along with them up and down; at firſt, a lye, it's like a ſtone in the water; you know a ſtone firſt caſt in makes a little circle, and then that another, and that another, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <note place="margin">Simile.</note> one greater than another: And ſo it is with many lyes, at firſt they appear not ſo great, but that makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and that another, and that another, and ſo they grow greater, and greater, and that exceedingly; there's <note place="margin">Several waies of encreaſing lyes. 1</note> many waies of multiplying and encreaſing lyes.</p>

                  <p>And then a Second way is, by miſreporting of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, <note place="margin">2</note> that is, by putting reports into another dreſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what men themſelves apprehend, and that which is a truth when it comes to be examined nakedly, yet they will, being put into another dreſs, and ſuch and ſuch things laid together in another way than they were at firſt, they will ſeem to be very falſe. This is a way of multiplying lyes.</p>

                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:43340:124"/>
Thirdly, by adding to reports, every man according <note place="margin">3</note> to his ſpirit, draws conſequences, and when he hath drawn them, he makes them to be part of the report, and ſo makes it to be the Original, as if it were the Original, whenas it is but the Comment, and ſo lyes comes to be multiplied.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, by inventing new ones they come to encreaſe <note place="margin">4</note> and multiply, becauſe ſuch and ſuch falſhoods will not do the feat, more ſhall then be added to them.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, they encreaſe and multiply, by maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">5</note> lyes by lyes, as if men be engaged once in a buſineſs, they muſt defend themſelves; If once they have miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported a thing, there's no help for it, but now it muſt be defended one way or other, ſomewhat muſt be done to defend it; as 'tis many times ſo in your ſervants, a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <note place="margin">Servants</note> hath done a thing amiſs, well, this Servant ſeeks to cover it by a lye, and when once he hath told one, he muſt tell a great many more to defend that one; and thus it is with men.</p>
                  <p>And truly my Brethren, ſeeing that this Scripture doth ſo by providence come in our way, let me ſpeak thus much to you from it. It is one of the ſtrangeſt things that ever was in the world, that there ſhould be ſuch ſtrange reports of things that are matters of fact, <note place="margin">(See the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology of the diſſenting Brethren: And the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it.)</note> yea, that one Godly man, or company of men ſhould ſay one thing, and others, that we think Godly men, ſhould ſay quite contrary, and both in matters of fact; I ſay, 'tis that which would make men ſtand amazed as much as ever any thing that fell out in any age, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der of it; for there is no ſin that is more againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity of a gracious heart, than a deliberate lye, to ſpeak againſt a mans knowledg, and againſt a mans conſcience, this ſin is againſt the ingenuity of a gracious heart as much as any ſin; and yet even ſuch as we think to be godly, and gracious, even reporting ſo quite croſs, what ſhall we ſay to this?</p>

Now what a difference is there in the hearts of men in theſe daies? Truly, I do not know a greater temptation to Atheiſm at this day than this is, for what will men think? There's ſuch Religious men ſpeak thus, and others that we account as Religious as they ſpeak quite contrary; Is there any Religion in the world? We ſee ſo much contradicting one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſurely one ſide muſt be falſe.

                  <p>For Firſt, Conſider, though one ſaith this thing is ſo, and the other faith it's quite contrary, yea, but it may be that both ſides do report according to their own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of things, and apprehending things in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent way, having divers principles, both of them may think they are in the Truth, and yet one may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the other, becauſe they may ſpeak according to their apprehenſions on both ſides, for it is very much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the principles of ones ſpirit in any thing, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if a buſineſs hath many things depending on it, and there are many circumſtances to be laid together,

                     </gap>hey will lay things together, ſo as may beſt ſute their principles; and others will ſay things together, ſo as may beſt ſute their principles, and ſo both of them may think they are in the Truth, and contradict one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and yet neither of them ſpeak againſt their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences: this (poſſibly I ſay) may even be among good men.</p>
                  <p>And then ſometimes the reaſon of contradiction, it is, <note place="margin">2</note> becauſe men do not ſpeak from their own knowledg, but they are ready to ſpeak from others, and are ſo confident in others; whomſoever men love, when they ſee men to be of their ſide and way, they are very confident in their rports, and ſo ſpeak it, not from being Eye-witneſſes themſelves, and ſo they may come to contradict one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and not go againſt their own conſciences: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports are croſs one to another; and this is the evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of giving credit to reports, and of running away too ſuddenly with them; But though it be an evil in men, yet it comes not from this, of ſpeaking againſt their conſciences.</p>
                  <p>And then a Third cauſe it may come from this, That when men report, they do not report all; Reports are <note place="margin">3</note> croſs one to another, yea, but did you hear all, or do you report all? It's a great matter when a man will take one piece of a thing and make a report of it, and not all; another man may come and report the quite contrary, whereas if all were brought together there might appear ſome agreement, and perhaps they would be both of the ſame mind if the whol ſeries of the thing were laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; bring things to the Original and then you ſee how they agree; as now, ſometimes in <hi>Scripture,</hi> there are <hi>divers readings,</hi> yea, but now by the bringing <hi>divers</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Simile, in Scripture.</note> 
                     <hi>Tranſlations</hi> to the <hi>Original,</hi> we come to ſee what an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there is: And ſo it is with reports, bring them to the Original, and ſo you may come to help your ſelves
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:43340:126"/>
and ſee what agreement may be made.</p>
                  <p>And then further, Reports (may be) are croſs, but the <note place="margin">4.</note> croſneſs of things may be in mens memories, rather than in the things themſelves, I ſay meerly in the memory, and people do not in all things that they ſpeak, ſay, why I remember thus, or I remember this is not expreſſed, but ſometimes the very nature of the thing carries it ſo.</p>
                  <p>My Brethren, therefore take heed of ſpreading reports <note place="margin">Uſe. 1.</note> to the diſhonor of Religion. And,</p>
                  <p>Secondly; If you hear any falſe things that you think <note place="margin">2.</note> ſurely this muſt be a lye, rather go to the party, or get ſome that are acquainted with them to go to them to ſee whether they can ſatisfie you in the thing; there's many men that ſtand and wonder at ſuch a report, whereas if they, or any friend for them, would but ſearch out the thing, they might have ſuch a plain hiſtory of the things related to them, as ſhould fully ſatisfie them, as they ſhould ſay, there would be no ſuch matter at all, ſo that their apprehenſione would be changed preſently. But ſo much concerning encreaſing of lyes in regard of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.</p>
                  <p>But then there's a Third thing here; That is, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing lyes in regard of <hi>Practice,</hi> ſtill following after <note place="margin">3. Lyes in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</note> new vanities, if they find not ſatisfaction in one they are not mov'd thereby to ſeek the true God that they may have ſatisfaction, but ſeek to have ſatisfaction in other things: Oh! let's conſider thus; I find no ſatisfaction in this, yea, but is it not becauſe I forſake the Lord God, <note place="margin">Why men find not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in their waies.</note> in whom there is all ſatisfaction? let me repair to God, and in him I ſhall find ſatisfaction. No, but they take another courſe; I have not ſatisfaction in this thing, then I'le ſeek to have ſatisfaction in another thing, and ſo they go from one falſe way to another, and encreaſe lyes in this ſenſe; I will have new deviſes to ſhift off Truth; the conſciences of men will not be put off with old ſhifts, they have ſatisfied their conſciences a while with one
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:43340:126"/>
ſhift, yea, but conſcience will not be put off long with that, but they muſt have another, and when conſcience <note place="margin">

                     </note> comes to apprehend the weakneſs of that, then it muſt have another; Oh; take heed of being inventive for the ſatisfying of conſcience. It follows;
<q>They have encreaſed lyes and deſolation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men when they imbrace their own vain conceits, and hopes, and falſe waies; they think they have gotten a <note place="margin">Expoſ.</note> great catch; but the truth is they imbrace their own ruin: Mark how they are put together, <hi>Encreaſe lyes,</hi> and <hi>deſolation</hi> is the <hi>fruit of lyes;</hi> and ſecondly, <hi>deſolation is encreaſed by lyes;</hi> the more ſin the more deſolation, you will periſh the more dreadfully, in <hi>Prov. 19. 8. A falſe witneſs</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>ſhall not be unpuniſhed, and be that ſpeaketh lyes ſhall periſh.</hi> He that walks uprightly he walks ſurely. <hi>Prov. 12. 19. The lip of Truth ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever, but a lying tongue is but for a moment;</hi> it may bluſter a while and keep ado, and deceive many, yea, but it is but for a moment. It follows;
<q>And they do make a Covenant with the <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> and Oyl is carried into <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, That they might have power to cruſh their <note place="margin">Expoſ.</note> Brethren of <hi>Judah,</hi> they think to ſtrengthen themſelves and ſo ſeek to make a Covenant with the <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> you have found this charged upon them many times here in this Propheſie of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> 13. 7. 11. and in <hi>Hoſea,</hi> 10. you have this ſin of making a Covenant with wicked men, and it is repeated again, and again, to ſhew the hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this ſin, in forſaking God, to joyn with ungodly men.</p>
                  <p>And to teach us this leſſon, <hi>That when people are guilty</hi>

                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:43340:127"/>
I ſhall not need to ſpeak any further of this, but only ſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Oyl is carried into</hi> Egypt] That is, They carry Oyl <note place="margin">Expoſ.</note> for gifts, and merchandize, the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded much in Oyl; but there was little or no Oyl in the Land of Egypt, and therefore it was a great merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize to carry Oyl from the Land of <hi>Cannan</hi> into <hi>Egypt;</hi> in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 27. 17. Judah, <hi>and the Land of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, they traded in thy Market, Wheat of</hi> Minnich, <hi>and</hi> Pannag, <hi>and Honey, and Oyl, and Balm.</hi> But this was (as it were) the ſtaple Commodity.</p>
                  <p>Now my Brethren, <hi>Egypt</hi> you know is a type of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi>

We would be loth to return into <hi>Egypt</hi> to our former bondage, but we even turn our ſelves to be as <hi>Egypt,</hi> we have little Oyl among us; What, is God brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging us to <hi>Canaan?</hi> how comes it to paſs there is no more Oyl then? Oh! the Oyl that is among us (if there be any) it's rather the Oyl of Scorpions, than any thing elſ! mens Spirits, and mens Pens, and mens Tongues are even full of this Oyl, as if the Ink that were made in theſe daies, were made of the Oyl of Scorpions. <hi>Iſrael</hi> (the ten Tribes) would ſend Oyl to <hi>Egypt,</hi> to gain the favour of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that they might have their wils over their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, they would be at a great deal of coſt, and part with their Oyl: Oh! my brethren, ſhall it be ſo with us? to apply it ſpiritually, that we might have our wils over our brethren, ſhall we part with our Oyl?

and loving one towards another, yet out of a deſire to prevail againſt their Brethren, they have parted with their Oyl, even with the tenderneſs and ſuppleneſs of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: Remember, <hi>Egypt</hi> hath no Oyl, but Oyl is in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> it grows there.</p>

                  <p>I find ſome therefore would reconcile it thus, and ſay, <note place="margin">Expoſ. 1</note> The Lord hath a Controverſie <hi>FOR Judah;</hi> (but that's a little ſtrain'd)</p>
                  <p>But the Lord hath a Controverſie <hi>WITH Judah.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. God <hi>comends,</hi> and <hi>contends</hi> with his Church at once. Reaſ. 1,</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And there may be Four Reaſons why after God had ſaid, <hi>That</hi> Judah <hi>rules with God, and is faithful with the Saints,</hi> that he ſaith, <hi>He hath a Controverſie with</hi> Judah.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt Reaſon is this, <hi>To ſhew, that God doth not ſo look at the good of his People, but he ſees the evil in them too.</hi> You know thoſe paſſages in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>Revelations,</hi> where God commends ſuch and ſuch Churches for doing thus and thus; but yet notwithſthnding, I have a few things againſt thee, I do not ſo obſerve your good, but I obſerve your evil too. My Brethren, ſome there are, that if there <note place="margin">Mens error in judging others. 1. 2.</note> be any evil in men, they can ſee no good in them, this is wicked. But others there are that if there be any good in them, can ſee no evil; this is too much indulgence too, it is two extremities in both.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:43340:128"/>
Secondly, Yet God hath a controverſie with <hi>Judah; Judah</hi> hath no cauſe to bleſs her ſelf in her waies that are <note place="margin">2.</note> good, becauſe ſhe retain'd the true Worſhip of God: Men are very apt to bleſs themſelves in ſome waies that are not good, becauſe they did chuſe ſome other waies that are good; I mean thus, That ſuch men as imbrace <note place="margin">Men excuſe their evil by their good.</note> the true Worſhip of God, are right there, they will have pure Ordinances, and the way of God right according to the Word, and becauſe of that though there be ſome looſneſs and negligence in their waies otherwaies, yet <note place="margin">Reformed worſhipers.</note> they put off conſcience with this, and think they are the true Worſhipers of God, and have the Ordinances of God in the purity and power of them, and ſo think to ſwallow down all, much looſneſs, much carnality, much pride, much ſenſualneſs, much hypocriſie, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are in the way of the true Worſhip of God they ſeek to ſatisfie conſcience with this. Oh! take heed of this, God may have a Controverſie againſt you.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Lord hath a Controverſie with</hi> Judah, he doth expreſs himſelf thus, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> might neither think <note place="margin">3</note> God or the Prophet partial. The ten Tribes might ſay, Doth God threaten us? Is not <hi>Judah</hi> as bad as we? are there not evils among <hi>Judah</hi> as well as us? are we only the ſinful people? No (ſaith the Prophet) I acknowledg there's much evil in <hi>Judah,</hi> and therefore the Lord hath a Controverſie againſt <hi>Judah</hi> too, and <hi>Judah</hi> is not like to eſcape, and let not this ſatisfie you, that becauſe others are bad, therefore you may eſcape; no, they are bad, and God hath a Controverſie againſt them. And this may be an uſeful Note to us, men are very ready to put off the evils that they are guilty of with this, I am not worſe than others, I do ſuch a thing amiſs, and others do ſuch a thing amiſs as well as I, and ſo they think to eſcape that way. Oh! thou weak man, thou vain man, why wilt thou deceive thy ſoul with this? Doeſt thou
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:43340:128"/>
think that another mans evil may be an excuſe to thy evil? Thou art a vain man and knoweſt not the way of God.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth Note is this: <hi>Therefore doth God ſay, he</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4</note> 
                     <hi>hath a Controverſie againſt</hi> Judah <hi>here, to ſhew them, how much more muſt the ten Tribes expect the diſpleaſure of God;</hi> If <hi>Judah</hi> who retains the true Worſhip of God, yet for ſome other evils God hath a Controverſie againſt them, then what will become of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who have thoſe evils, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the true Worſhip of God too? As if the Prophet ſhould ſay, your condition is far worſe, therefore doth the Lord ſay, he hath a Controverſie againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> that he might aggravate the evils of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> like that of <hi>Peter, If Judgment begin at the Houſe of God, where ſhall the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and the ſinner appear?</hi> If ſo be that the Church which have the Ordinances in the purity of them, yet God is diſpleaſed with them for their ſin, how much more will he be diſpleaſed with them who are corrupt in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God? Therefore men ſhould not bleſs themſelves with ſuch diſcourſe as this: Why, others have evils as well as we, yea, but if God will puniſh them for their evils that have ſewer, and a great deal more good than thou, how much more will he puniſh thee? Oh! if thoſe that are the dear Saints of God, that worſhip him in truth and ſincerity, and they have evils among them, but yet they ſhall not eſcape ſcot-free, Oh! then, what will become of thee who art a wicked and vile wretch and haſt no good at all? If a <hi>Moſes</hi> that had done God ſo much ſervice, yet for one ſin of paſſion (for ſo it was) was ſhut out of the Land of <hi>Cannan,</hi> (it was but one time that he ſpake unadviſedly with his lips, that God ſhut him out, and bid him ſpeak no more to him of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) what will become of thee that haſt a paſſionate fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſpirit, and thou that never haſt, nor wilt do God <note place="margin">A Note for paſſionat men</note> the ſervice that ſuch a Servant of his hath done, what will become of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </p>
                  <p>There is Two Queſtions neceſſarie for the opening of this.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Why the ten Tribes are call'd by the name of <hi>Jacob,</hi> we never reade that they are call'd by the name of <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> 
                     <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for the Anſwer to that, it's given thus; which is a very ſatisfying Anſwer, That therefore the People <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> of God are call'd in Scripture by the name of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and by the name of <hi>Iſrael</hi> his other name, rather than by the name of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> becauſe they (though godly) and were the Father and Grand-father, yet in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family there was wicked aſwel as good; likewiſe from <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac's</hi> loins there came <hi>Eſau</hi> aſwel as <hi>Jacob;</hi> but now from <hi>Jacobs</hi> loyns there came none but were of Gods Church, all <hi>Jacobs</hi> Sons they are the twelve Patriarchs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are call'd by the name of <hi>Jacob,</hi> rather than <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> or <hi>Iſaac;</hi> and therefore when he ſpeaks of the People of God, he calls them the ſeed of <hi>Jacob, I ſaid not to the ſeed of</hi> Jacob, <hi>ſeek ye me in vain.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Queſt.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then Secondly, <hi>Why is</hi> Jacob <hi>mentioned in this place?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Becauſe the Prophet intends preſently in the words that follow, to bring the example of <hi>Jacob</hi> to them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to aggravate their ſin for the work of humiliation, and therefore here he names <hi>Jacob</hi> to take away that vain plea of their hearts, whereas they would ſay, Why were not we the poſterity of <hi>Jacob,</hi> Have not we <hi>Jacob</hi> to be our Father? Well (ſaith he) I'le puniſh <hi>Jacob,</hi> and I'le ſhew you by and by that you have no ſuch cauſe to boaſt your ſelves, that you have <hi>Jacob to be your Father,</hi> and ſo I take it, and moſt Interpreters, that
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:43340:129"/>
by <hi>Jacob</hi> he means the ten Tribes. Now for the other part of the text I ſhall ſpeak nothing concerning that, becauſe in Chap. 4. Ver. 9. we had the very ſame words there. It follows;</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THis Prophet enveighing againſt the ſins of theſe ten Tribes, and threatning Judgments in theſe words; He takes away the plea that he ſaw was in their hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what he had ſaid, We are the children of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and why do you thus charge us, and threaten us in the Name of God? was not <hi>Jacob</hi> our Father? As in Chriſts time they pleaded that <hi>Abraham</hi> was their Father.</p>
                  <p>Now in theſe words read unto you, the Prophet takes away this plea, and the ſcope of them comes to this, as <note place="margin">Scope of the Text.</note> if he had ſaid, you may bleſs your ſelves in that <hi>Jacob</hi> was your Father, but it will do you little good, for you are a degenerate off-ſpring from him; It's true, God was very gracious to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> was very deer to God, it's otherwiſe with you, <hi>Jacob</hi> worſhiped God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another manner than you do; The Prophet therefore ſets before this people here in the words read, Gods mercy to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Jacobs</hi> graciouſneſs in his behavior towards God, that he might upbraid thoſe children of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who walked ſo unworthy of ſuch a gracious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as <hi>Jacob</hi> was, that's the ſcope.</p>
                  <p>Now how this is ſet forth we ſhall ſpeak to preſently, only for the ſcope of the Prophet in theſe three Verſes read unto you we take notice only of this one inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

the relation that their parents had to God, and what worſhipers of God their parents were: children that have had gracious parents ſhould look upon it as a ſhame to them when at any time the graciouſneſs of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents is but mentioned before them. I remember I have read of a King of <hi>Poland,</hi> that was wont to carry the picture of his Father in a plate of Gold about his neck, that he had honorable eſteem of, and when he was to do any matter of great importance, he would take this pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture and kiſs it, and uſe theſe words, <hi>God grant that I may do nothing now remiſly, that I may do nothing now unworthy of my Father;</hi> becauſe his Father was ſo good a man. Oh! you that have had gracious Anceſtors, think often of them, and when you are tempted to ſin, think this, Is not this unworthy of my Anceſtors? would they have done thus? Children ſhould ſo walk as the vertues of their Fathers ſhould not die in them, but they ſhould hold them forth. As <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in an Oration of his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Ambroſe. Theodotius.</note> the Commendations of <hi>Theodotius,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Though</hi> Theodotius <hi>be gone, yet ſurely ſo long as his Son lives,</hi> Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotius <hi>will live among us.</hi> He meant thus, that the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of that vertuous Emperor would certainly live in his Son that was ſo hopeful. Oh! it's an excellent thing when the vertues of gracious parents do live in their Children; and it is a very evil thing when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are dead, yea, and their vertues are dead in reſpect of their children, there's nothing of them appears in them; they love to inherit their Lands and Eſtates, but it was a great deal better to inherit their vertues, and their godlineſs. But the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not inherit the godlineſs of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and did not ſo much take to heart the goodneſs of God towards their Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> that the Prophet doth here now lay open before them, and to that end he makes uſe of three Hiſtories. There is three famous Hiſtories in the two firſt verſes that I have read to you that the Prophet here makes uſe of, and there's

                     <hi>Luther,</hi> here's the man that will do all things famouſly; when <hi>Eſau</hi> was born, and they ſaw him ſo hairy, they thought he was the man that would do very great and famous things in the world, and from thence he had his name <hi>Eſau:</hi> Now <hi>Iacob</hi> in his birth he takes this <hi>Eſau</hi> that every one thought when he was born would have been a famous man, and done famous things, he takes him by the heel: ſaith <hi>Luther</hi> upon the place, a moſt wonderful Hiſtory, this taking his brother by the heel.</p>
                  <p>But what's the meaning of this, (you will ſay?) why doth the Prophet inſtance in this? to what purpoſe is <note place="margin">Reaſons why the Scripture ſets down <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> taking his brother by the heel.</note> this to the ten Tribes, that <hi>Iacob</hi> took his brother by the heel? what good would this do to the People, that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea</hi> was propheſying to? he tells them that their Father
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:43340:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Iacob</hi> take his brother by the heel? what did he aim at? Was this ſtory to be a means to humble the people for their ſins? how could it do it? Therefore we muſt know that the ſcope &amp; meaning of this great work of God, in taking his brother by the heel, it was this:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It ſhewed, That though <hi>Eſau</hi> was the firſt born, and ſo in an orderly courſe the birthright ſhould have deſcended upon him, and upon his poſterity, for ſo it did, the bleſſing did uſe to go along with the firſt-born, and with their poſterity; in which the firſt-born was a type of Chriſt, who is called, <hi>The firſt begotten of all creatures:</hi> and the bleſſing upon the firſt born was a type of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that we have by Chriſt: Now though this in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly way belonged to <hi>Eſau,</hi> as being the firſt-born, yet <hi>Jacob</hi>'s taking of him by the heel, was a certain token from God that <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould ſupplant him, and that he ſhould get the birthright from him, and ſo the bleſſing from him; and in that <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould thus get the bleſſing, though he were the yonger, and this ſign was given of it when he was in the womb; this did ſhew the free election of God, that it was through Gods meer free Grace that <hi>Jacob</hi> had the bleſſing rather than <hi>Eſau,</hi> and ſo that the poſterity of <hi>Jacob</hi> were in a better condition than the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of <hi>Eſau:</hi> It was only the free Grace of God, not from any excellency in <hi>Jacob,</hi> any worthines in him more than in <hi>Eſau,</hi> for God ſhewed a ſign of it that he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded good when they were in the womb, before <hi>Jacob</hi> could do any thing that was good.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Eſau</hi> was the Elder, ſtronger, hairy, active, ſtout man, and <hi>Jacob</hi> a plain man, yet <hi>Jacob</hi> is choſen, <hi>Eſau</hi> is rejected; and God ſhews the ſign of this, by his taking his brother by the heel. Now this concern'd the people very much, they underſtanding this to be the ſcope of it.</p>
                  <p>As if he ſhould ſay, What, you are the poſterity of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:43340:131"/>
                     <hi>Jacob,</hi> and not of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and you glory in this; Wel, how comes it to paſs there is ſo great a priviledge to the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Iacob</hi> rather than to the poſterity of <hi>Eſau?</hi> how comes this? Is it not from the free Grace of God in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing one rather than the other, &amp; that in the very womb? as in <hi>Mal. 1. 2. I have loved you, ſaith the Lord; yet ye ſay, Wherein haſt thou loved us? Was not</hi> Eſau Jacob's <hi>brother, ſaith the Lord? yet I loved</hi> Jacob, <hi>and hated</hi> Eſau. In this I manifeſted my free love, even unto this people, that though <hi>Eſau</hi> was <hi>Iacob</hi>'s brother, and eldeſt brother, yet I loved <hi>Iacob,</hi> and hated <hi>Eſau.</hi> So in <hi>Rom. 9. 11. The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being not yet born, neither having done good or evil, that the purpoſe of God according to election might ſtand; not of works, but of him that calleth. It was ſaid, The elder ſhall ſerve the yonger; as it is written,</hi> Jacob <hi>have I loved, but</hi> Eſau <hi>have I hated.</hi> Now this was to ſhew Gods free grace, that it was in the womb.</p>
                  <p>If any ſhould ſay, <hi>But God foreſaw that</hi> Jacob <hi>would be</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> 
                     <hi>a better man than</hi> Eſau.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer: If it were of foreſeen works, there were no <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Argument in this to prove Gods free election, but the Apoſtle makes it to be an Argument to prove Gods free election of <hi>Iacob</hi> rather than <hi>Eſau,</hi> becauſe he choſe them in the womb.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Luther</hi> upon the 25. Chap. of <hi>Geneſis</hi> hath an excellent <note place="margin">Luther in <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.</note> diſcourſe upon this ſubject, concerning Gods rejecting the pride, pomp and vanity of the world, and chuſing the things that are mean and contemptible in the eyes of the world; and it was an emblem of it, in that God would rather chuſe <hi>Iacob</hi> the <hi>plain</hi> man, than <hi>Eſau</hi> the <hi>hunter,</hi> and the <hi>hairy</hi> man: I ſay, it was an emblem of this, That the Lord intends to reject the brave things in the world, the galantry, glory and pomp of the world, and wil rather chuſe the mean and contemptible things of the world: Who can perſwade (ſaith <hi>Luther</hi> upon the place) the <hi>Pope,</hi> and <hi>Charls the fifth,</hi> the <hi>French King,</hi> and the like,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:43340:132"/>
that they being great in the world, yet are contemptible in the eyes of God, and God hath rather choſen deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and contemptible things than them? And that was the ſcope of the Prophet to humble this people, that they ſhould conſider of the free grace of God towards <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And we ſhould make uſe of this, <hi>We are to conſider the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>free Grace of God how it hath wrought in chuſing our for fathers, and what good we do enjoy by ſuch a choice, we are to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg it to be a fruit of free Grace too;</hi> Others were before God as well as our forefathers; as now, when God brought the Goſpel firſt to <hi>England,</hi> other Nations were before God as well as them, It was meer free Grace that pitcht upon them rather than others, and we enjoy the bleſſing of it to this day, let us not ſin againſt this free Grace of God ſhewed to our Anceſtors.</p>
                  <p>And more particularly, <hi>You that now enjoy great bleſſings from Gods mercies to your Anceſtors either outward or inward,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>you muſt conſider the free Grace of God;</hi> as now, ſuch of you as are rich, great in the world; whence is it that your Anceſtors were richer than others, and were not beggers as well as others? Was it not free Grace, free Grace in <note place="margin">The free grace of God to our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors.</note> in the kind of it? it was the free goodneſs of God; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that had their Anceſtors to be beggers they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in the ſame lump with your Anceſtors, and that God ſhould rather pitch upon your Anceſtors to be honorable in the earth and rich, and you enjoy the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it in this world, look to the free goodneſs of God that hath made ſuch a difference between your Anceſtors and others; it may be ſome of you, though you be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, and rich, yet your elder Brother might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and ſometimes Families riſes from the yonger Brother rather than the elder; It was ſo here, <hi>Iacob</hi> that was the yonger he afterwards came to have the bleſſing, and <hi>Eſau</hi> rejected. And it may be that the poſterity of the elder Brother proves wicked; it was ſo here, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:43340:132"/>
in the Family of <hi>Jacob</hi> and not in <hi>Eſau;</hi> look back to this, and ſee what cauſe you have to bleſs God, and how you are engaged to the free Grace of God towards you in regard of your Anceſtors; as here the Prophet would have this people look back to the free Grace of God to their Father <hi>Jacob;</hi> and that's the firſt thing the Prophet aim'd at.</p>
                  <p>But in the Second place,</p>
                  <p>Jacob <hi>took his Brother by the heel.</hi> That is, as if he ſhould <note place="margin">Expoſ. 2.</note> ſay, your Father <hi>Iacob</hi> he was greedy of the bleſſing, gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the birth-right, there was a ſecret in ſtinct of God upon the ſpirit of <hi>Iacob</hi> when he was in the very womb, to be greedy of the bleſſing of the birthright, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would do what he could to get it from his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as if the Prophet ſhould ſay, Oh! but you that are his poſterity you are carnal, you do not regard the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg of the birthright, you do not regard the bleſſing that comes by it, being carnal you care not which way that goes, ſo be it you may but live and have your eaſe and contentment to the fleſh; Oh! you are not like your Father <hi>Iacob</hi> that was ſo greedy to have this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
                  <p>We are to make uſe of this for our inſtruction thus, <note place="margin">Uſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</note> ſome of you that have had your parents very forward in their youth, betimes ſome of your Parents were gracious and godly, were greedy of the things of God, now you ſhould make uſe of that for the humbling of your ſouls, Oh! how negligent have I been? how careleſs is my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ſlight and vain? yea, though I be come to yeers, do little regard that which my Parents were greedy upon when they were very yong. That's a ſecond thing.</p>
                  <p>And then yet further, Jacobs <hi>taking his brother by the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Expoſ. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>heel,</hi> in the third place, it was a type of the prevailing of the Church, of the people of God againſt the wicked at laſt; God made <hi>Iacob</hi> a famous and notable type in this work; That certainly the Saints though they may ſeem
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:43340:133"/>
to be low and mean for the preſent, yet they ſhall get ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over the men of the world. The men of the world are ſet out by <hi>Eſau,</hi> they are ruffling abroad in the world, &amp; of fiery hot ſpirits as <hi>Eſau</hi> was, &amp; they have great things in the world for a time, and the Saints are under them, as <hi>Iacob</hi> was under <hi>Eſau;</hi> but certainly the Saints ſhall prevail againſt all the <hi>Edomites,</hi> all the <hi>Eſaus</hi> (as I may ſo ſpeak) there is a time that they ſhall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant them, and get the power over them, this was typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in this work of God upon <hi>Iacob</hi> in the womb, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his brother by the heel, the godly ſhall prevail at length againſt all the wicked and ungodly in the world: You ſhould conſider it, as if the Prophet ſhould ſay to them; you are ſeeking to provide for your ſelves in the ſinful way you are in, Oh! if you did but conſider, that the faithful, though they be perſecuted for a time, what low condition ſoever they are, yet they ſhall get the power over all the great ones in the world, it would be otherwiſe with you than now it is. So we find in Scripture that though indeed the way of the Saints be ſuch as they are kept low for a long time, yet the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells us, that at length they ſhall have the dominion, in <hi>Dan. 7. 18. The Saints of the moſt High ſhall take the Kingdom,</hi> and in the 21. verſe, <hi>I beheld, and the ſame horn made war with the Saints, and prevailed againſt them,</hi> (but how long?) <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil the Antient of daies came, and judgment was given to the Saints of the moſt High, and the time came that the Saints poſſeſſed the Kingdom.</hi> And verſe 17. <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Dominion, and the greatneſs of the Kingdom under the whol Heaven ſhall be given to the people of the Saints of the moſt High,</hi> There is a time that it ſhall be given to them. And <hi>Pſal. 49. 14. The upright ſhall have dominion over them in the morning.</hi> This was typified in this notable work of God in <hi>Iacob's</hi> taking <hi>Eſau</hi> by the heel to ſupplant him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Here we may ſee the providence of God, <note place="margin">4.</note>
                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:43340:133"/>
how it extends towards infants, even in the very womb; the very ſtriving of children in the womb is not without providence; there was a mighty providence of God in this, to ſet out the greateſt things of God that are revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Scripture. Now though there be ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and great things ſet forth by the ordinary ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of infants in the womb, yet certainly there is no ſtirring of the child in the womb but it is with ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, and God he hath his eye upon, and his hand in the working even of the very child in the womb.</p>
                  <p>And yet further, <hi>Luther</hi> obſerves the ſecret waies of <note place="margin">5.</note> God in working upon infants, and though they have not the uſe of Reaſon, yet ſaith he, there may be mighty workings of God even upon their ſpirits in a ſecret way that we are not able to underſtand: And upon that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion he falls a crying out upon ſuch as do deny bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to them, upon that very ground, becauſe they are not capable of any work of God upon them, and the denying of it upon that ground, he calls it a very odious <note place="margin">Odioſum &amp; impium dogma Anabaptiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, qui ideo pueris Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum negant, quia ſenſu ac mentacareant, nec intelligant quae cum eu a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntur. <hi>Luth. in loc.</hi> 6.</note> opinion, to think that becauſe of that, they ſhould not have it, for ſaith he, as it is with children, they have their nouriſhment in the womb in another manner than when they are born, and ſo the works of God upon their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits may be ſuch as when they are in the womb, and when they are little ones before they come to the uſe of Reaſon, that may be far different to what the work of God is upon them when they come afterwards to have the uſe of Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>And then the laſt thing that is to be noted from hence, is this, <hi>That men who prove notable in their lives, have many times notable preſages of their notable exploits in their very birth of what they ſhould do after;</hi> as it was a notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit that <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould do in ſupplanting his Brother: By ſome notable providences God ſhews many times what men ſhall do that he chuſes to be eminent in the world; as <hi>Moſes,</hi> by what was done upon his birth there
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:43340:134"/>
was a preſage of his ſtrange and wonderful kind of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance when he was both, and being brought into <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh's</hi> Court: and ſo <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> a Preſage of what ſhould be afterwards; and ſo other ſtories tell us of men that have been famous for good or evil, there hath been preſages at their birth. I remember it is ſaid of <hi>Nero</hi> that did ſuch monſtrous things, that when he was born, he was born with his heels forward: and it is ſaid of <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi> that great perſecuter of the Saints, that when his Mother was with child, ſhe dream'd that ſhe had in her womb, a Wolf with a fire-brand in his mouth, and he even proved to be ſo, for he was one of the firſt that ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up Perſecution againſt the SAINTS by FIRE; and your Papiſts they turn it quite otherwiſe; I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber one of the Papiſts interpreting this providence of God, that the Mother of <hi>Dominicus</hi> (who was the father of the <hi>Dominicans)</hi> ſhould have ſuch a dream; it was to <note place="margin">
                        <hi>S.

Now I note this only to ſhew the vanity of mens ſpirits in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting waies of providence meerly according to their own humors. And thus much for that notable ſtory of Jacobs <hi>taking his brother by the heel.</hi> Now follows the next, and that is,

time; for the time that God came &amp; wraſtled with him, and ſeem'd to be as an enemy to him, it was in the time of the greateſt extremity that one would think it's poſſible for a man to be in, you cannot apprehend greater diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or greater cauſe than there was for the diſtreſ, of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> at this time; A poor man with a few women and children and cattel, and having his brother that owed him a grudg, and had ſought his death, to come with four hundred men in an hoſtile way, and he left alone, and at this time God appears like an enemy to him, this was ſad, a very heavie condition indeed. As God did with <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſo with Chriſt himſelf; when Chriſt was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, God never appeared in outward appearance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt as at that time when his Diſciples left him, juſt in the night when he was to be betrayed then he was in an Agony, and ſweat drops of water and blood, yea, and when he was in the hands of his enemies, and lift up to the Croſs, and made a deciſion to all the world, yet then he cries, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Forſaken at that time in ſo great a diſtreſs; <hi>Jacob</hi> in this was even a type of Gods forſaking Chriſt in times of ſuch great diſtreſs.

them like an enemy, Oh! this is the ſaddeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that can be, to any one that hath any acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God. You ſhall have many poor Servants of God in affliction wil ſay, As for theſe afflictions they are heavy indeed upon me, my Eſtate gon, or Husband gon, or Wife gon, my Friends leave me in this condition, yea, and it may be the hand of God is upon me in ſickneſs, and ſo one trouble after another; Oh! but though theſe are heavy, had I but the light of the face of God upon me it would be nothing to me, had I but thoſe comforts that once I had in the aſſurance of Gods love, it would not be much to me; but when all theſe outward comforts are gone, and I never ſaw God appearing like an enemy to me ſo as at this time, Doth God deal thus with any of his people? Am I not a Reprobate? For God doth uſe when his People are in affliction, then to appear with the light of his face to comfort and encourage them; but he hath not done ſo to me, even at this time I find God more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to my ſoul than ever yet I found him, and therfore ſurely I am but a caſt-away: I make no queſtion but ſome of you may know the meaning of ſuch temptations as theſe are in the time of your afflictions, or if you have not known the meaning of them hitherto, you may come to know the meaning of them hereafter; and you that have known, or hereafter if you ſhall know what theſe things mean, Oh! treaſure up this Scripture, it will be worth a world to you, For the Devil wil mightily ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then himſelf with this, What, are not you a caſt-away? ſurely God hath rejected you, he would never appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you in your afflictions if he had any love to you.</p>
                  <p>Or you may anſwer the temptation thus:</p>
                  <p>Yes, yes, I have read in the Book of God, and heard <note place="margin">2.</note> that even thus God dealt with my father <hi>Jacob</hi> that was ſo precious.</p>

No, he was in the way that God bad him go on in, <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and yet even then when he was in ſo great a diſtreſs, God wraſtled with him, never wraſtled more with him than then, and ſeem'd to come againſt him like an enemy, and ſuch a time as that was, Oh! treaſure up this that your hearts may not ſink in deſpair, in the greateſt afflictions, and ſpiritual diſſertions that are both together.</p>
                  <p>Only this by the way,

                        <hi>—He had power with God.</hi>

                  <p>It appears that when God came thus againſt him to <note place="margin">Expoſ. 2.</note> wraſtle with him, God intended no hurt to him, it was but to ſtir up his ſtrength, and to prepare him for great deliverance, and for choice mercies, God at this time did intend to <hi>Jacob</hi> as great a mercie as ever he gave to any of the children of men in this world, and that was this, <hi>That he ſhould have ſtrength to prevail with God,</hi> and as a Prince to prevail with God, and that he ſhould in this be a type of all his people hereafter that they ſhould prevail with God, that he ſhould have his name changed and be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe he was a Prince prevailing with God, and in this he ſhould be honorable to the end of the world, and be ſet up as a type for the comfort of al the Saints to the end of the world; I ſay, it was as great a mercy as ever any meer child of man had in this world, at this time when <hi>Jacob</hi> was in the greateſt depth of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction almoſt as you can conceive a man to be in.</p>
                  <p>Therefore oh remember this that it is the way of God <note place="margin">God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times brings the deepeſt afflictions when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the greateſt mercy.</note> when he doth intend the greateſt mercy to any of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſometimes to bring them into the depth of affliction, and therefore do not conclude that never any was ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted as I have been, why <hi>Jacob</hi> might have ſaid ſo, and yet at that time God had never greater thoughts of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy than he had to him then, and therefore remember this again, when ſuch kind of temptations work, never any
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:43340:137"/>
was ſo afflicted as I have been, grant it, yet it may be there is mercy intended for you at this time, that never yet was granted to any of the children of men before, 'tis poſſible it may be ſo, it was ſo with <hi>Jacob,</hi> and therefore let not your faith flag.</p>

It may be you have that ſtrength that will do more than you are aware of, the grace of God is mighty in the hearts of his Saints: Have you never been enabled to do more than ever you thought you ſhould have been ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to have done? he ſtirs up his ſtrength, he doth not lie down ſullen and diſcouraged; as it's uſual for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to do if God doth but afflict them, and ſpecially if he draws but the light of his face a little from them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently they lie down diſcouraged, and will not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted: Oh! thou doeſt not ſhew thy ſelf to be of the ſeed of <hi>Iacob,</hi> thou haſt not the ſpirit of thy Father <hi>Iacob</hi> in thee.

                  <p>He had very great bodily ſtrength, he wraſtled partly with bodily ſtrength, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 29. 8. 10. you ſhall find that <hi>Jacob</hi> was a very ſtrong man of his body, for the Stone of the Well that the Shepherds was fain to meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to roul away, <hi>Jacob</hi> took it and roul'd it away preſently; but certainly he had ſtrength beyond his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary bodily ſtrength at this time, God raiſed a bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrength beyond what ever he had, and it's like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what ever man had before; God raiſed <hi>Sampſons</hi> bodily ſtrength to be very great, and the power of God was ſeen in that, and may be ſeen much in the elevating of nature in a creature, whereas the Scripture ſaith, <hi>The body that is ſown in weakneſs, ſhall riſe in power.</hi> I remember <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 43</note>

with an Angel, that is the Son of God, the Second per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Trinity, that is the Meſſenger, the Angel of the new Covenant, but eſpecially his ſpiritual ſtrength was great, wraſtling with his ſoul, the wraſtling of <hi>Faith</hi> that was in his ſoul at that time, that was very great, he had power with his ſpirit when he did prevail.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> This was an evidence to <hi>Jacob,</hi> that certainly he ſhould prevail againſt his brother <hi>Eſau, Eſau</hi> came againſt him to deſtroy him, and he was afraid, God gave him a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain evidence that he ſhould prevail, ſaith he, Thou haſt prevail'd with me, and there's no fear of prevailing with all the men of the world, now thou haſt prevailed with
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:43340:139"/>
God. This indeed were a notable point, if one would ſpeak of this at large, and a very uſeful point in theſe times, That the way to prevail with men, it is, <hi>to prevail with God:</hi> What's all the powers of men? they are all at the diſpoſe of God; the work is done when thou haſt but prevail'd with God; thou heateſt of great dangers that there are abroad in the world, but do thou get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in thy cloſet and fall a wraſtling with God, and be wraſtling till thou feeleſt thy faith wraſtling with God, then thou mayeſt come down and conclude the work is done; no men ſhal ever prevail againſt you that have ſo much intereſt with God, theſe may live joyfully in the world, never need fear the power and the rage of wicked men, they have that within them that helps them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with God, and certainly man cannot prevail againſt them. Our rough brethren have come out againſt us, as here <hi>Eſau</hi> this rough brother of <hi>Jacob</hi> came out againſt him, and yet <hi>Jacob</hi> prevailing with God, prevail'd againſt him: And bleſſed be God, that when our rough bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren have come enraged againſt us, there hath been ſome amongſt us have prevailed with God, and by prevailing with God, have prevailed over them, and againſt them: But though we are delivered from theſe rough brethren, yet we have rough ones in another kind ſtill, that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us; Oh, but let us carry our ſelves blameleſly, and inoffencively towards them, that yet behave themſelves roughly and furiouſly againſt us, and ſo ſeek to prevail with them that way, in a conſtant carriage of innocence and blameleſs lives before them, to convince them if it be poſſible of all their miſtakes: But above all, let us ſeek to prevail with God, and then God may turn their hearts, turn the hearts of our rougheſt and furiouſeſt brethren, whoſe mouthes are ſo opened as they are, and whoſe pens do go ſo as they do, let's prevail with God, that ſo at length they may come and fall upon their necks as <hi>Eſau</hi> did, and to give them the right hand of fellowſhip;
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:43340:140"/>
it's not impoſſible that ſuch things may be done, ſurely one would not have thought that they that were at ſuch a diſtance as they were, that they ſhould have come ſo together, ſurely we have never provoked our brethren ſo as <hi>Eſau</hi> hath done <hi>Jacob:</hi> let's not be troubled more than God would have us, but ſeek God, and wraſtle with God, it's in vain to ſtand wraſtling with them, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ill word for ill word, and pen for pen, that's not the way, but wraſtle with God, and walk convincingly before them, and ſo you may turn the hearts of our rough brethren, and that in a little time; ſurely it's not more impoſſible to ſoder the ſpirits of brethren that ſeem not to be at ſo great a diſtance and ſo imbittered one againſt another, it is not more impoſſible to ſoder them, than it was here with God to ſoder the ſpirits of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and to have ſuch a comfortable meeting as there was at this time.</p>
                  <p>In this prevailing of <hi>Iacob</hi> againſt <hi>Eſau</hi> we have a type of the Churches prevailing againſt all the ungodly; though the Enemies may be ſtrong and furious, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the people of God ſhall prevail. As before in <hi>Iacobs</hi> taking <hi>Eſau</hi> by the heel, there was a type that the people of God ſhall ſupplant all the wicked; ſo in <hi>Iacob's</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing at this time, here's a type that certainly the Churches ſhall prevail let men do what they will, and be as bitter as they will, the <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſhall prevail at length.</p>
                  <p>Mark yet further, <hi>With his power he prevailed even over the Angel.]</hi> If you look into the Story you ſhall find that <note place="margin">Expoſ.</note> he did prevail, but it was after he had wraſtled a great while; Conſtancie in wraſtling with God will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come at length, though we do not prevail at firſt, as <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> did not, but was wraſtling all night, and day broke, and then he prevailed: Oh! be not diſcouraged though you prevail not at firſt. Oh! I have been ſeeking God thus long, and have not prevailed, but go on ſtill, you
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:43340:140"/>
know not but that may be done in one hour that hath not been done a long time before.</p>
                  <p>Mark further, <hi>Iacob</hi> after he was lame prevailed; <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Expoſ.</note> had been wraſtling all night, and got nothing, then the hollow of his theigh was toucht and he was lame, now ſurely he will be overcome; ſhall he prevail now? he that could not prevail when he was ſo long and ſtrong he is not like to prevail now, Oh! this is very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſeaſonable for us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the times for the Churches prevailing, it is the times when they are moſt weake,</hi> when they are moſt unlikely to <note place="margin">Obſ.</note> prevail, when they are lame, why then is the time for them to prevail; We are ready to think, Oh! if we could not get it when we had ſo much ſtrength, is it like to be done now we have ſo little ſtrength? Now by this <hi>Iacob</hi> came to be more humbled when his theigh was toucht, ſo that he was lame: God uſes to damp means, and to bring even the ſentence of death before he doth intend to bring the greateſt mercies.</p>
                  <p>Further, <hi>Iacob</hi> though he had a ſtrong Adverſary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and he wraſtled long with him, and he was lame, yet continuing wraſtling, he grew more reſolute towards the latter end than he was before; for you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read of <hi>Iacob</hi> ſo peremptory before, <hi>I wil not let thee go, until thou bleſs me;</hi> and that's one thing that's very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable for the ſad condition <hi>Iacob</hi> was in, the hollow of his theigh was toucht, and that likewiſe ſhould have been added, That the Angel would have been gone, God would have been gon and have left him in that affliction, but then <hi>Iacob's</hi> ſpirit grew up more with a greater reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution than he had before, <hi>I will not let thee go, except thou bleſs me:</hi> It ſeems now that <hi>Iacob</hi> had more ſight of him that he was God than he had before. This ſhould be our way in our dealings with God, that when God brings us in the loweſt condition, and God ſeems as if he would leave us, we ſhould ſtir up our ſpirits then, and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:43340:141"/>
be more reſolute and ſtrong than before, Oh! it's time now for the heart to beſtir its ſelf, when God is ready to go away, do not ſay, God will be gone, and therefore link down ſullenly, but it's time for thee then to ſtir up all that thou haſt, and to act faith more then, as if <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould ſay, I will try yet one fall more, I will not yield the cauſe yet, certainly I muſt not periſh; as if <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould ſay, it's true, all things ſeem againſt me, as if I ſhould be deſtroyed, but it muſt not be ſaith <hi>Jacob,</hi> Faith begins to ſtir, Hath not God bid me come here? have I not the Word of God for it? did not God ſay, he would do me good in this journy? and though it's true, the providence of God ſeems to work againſt me, but yet the Word of God works for me, and I will try whether ſhall prevail, Gods Word, or Gods Providence: thus <hi>Jacob</hi> wraſtles, <hi>I will not let thee go,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, I have the Word for what I do, and God hath bound himſelf by Covenant, and ſo long, though Heaven and Earth meet together, although I ſee my brother coming againſt me, and God departing from me, and all threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ruin, yet I will beleeve ſtill that there is mercy for me; This was <hi>Jacobs</hi> laſt turn (as I may ſo ſay) as the trying as it were the laſt fall in this his wraſtling, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Word that he had, with the Work of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him: And this is a Note of very great uſe in al our conditions, let us not lay ſo much weight upon any Work of God as upon the Word of God, let us build upon the Word rather than fear the Works, for it hath been the uſual way of God when he hath given out a Word, that his Works have ſeem'd to go quite croſs, as not only in our father <hi>Jacob,</hi> but even in our father <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> What was the Word of God to <hi>Abraham?</hi> There was two promiſes by God made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> one was this, <note place="margin">Two Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 1. 2.</note> That he would bring him into a Land that flowed with milk and hony.

Word, But how was Gods Work? The very next thing that you hear of him, he was carried into <hi>Canaan,</hi> after he had left all his friends and was ready to ſtarve preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, now the word is, <hi>Thou ſhalt be brought into a Land that flows with milk and bony;</hi> and aſſoon as ever he comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Land he was ready to ſtarve.

                  <p>And then a ſecond Promiſe of having his ſeed as the <note place="margin">2.</note> Stars of Heaven; <hi>Abraham</hi> was twenty five yeers after this before he had any one child of the Promiſe, and he grew old, and alſo his wife: Well, he had at length one, and God commands him to kill that one, to ſacrifice that one; But what a work is here? how quite contrary to the Word? Well he was ſaved; and <hi>Iſaac</hi> is forty yeers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he marries; here's ſixty five yeers gone from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and there's but even one of his ſeed that muſt be as the Stars of Heaven, at length <hi>Iſaac</hi> marries and he was twenty yeers without a child, here's eighty five yeers and but only one birth from him; yea, and after that the ſtory will make it out, that <hi>Jacob</hi> was above fourſcore yeers before he married and had any children, there's between eight and nine ſcore yeers gone, and here's but only <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi> How doth the Work of God ſeem againſt his Word in appearance? It's the way of God, and therefore let us never trouble our ſelves about Gods Works; he came indeed afterwards with his Works and fulfilled his Word to the uttermoſt, but for the preſent it ſeem'd to be againſt it.

                     <p>He wept, and he made ſupplication.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THis weeping of <hi>Jacob</hi> is not recorded in the Hiſtory of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> nor in all the Book of God, but only here; his ſupplication is recorded, but not his weeping: therefore his weeping was had either from hand to hand, by way of tradition, (it was known that when he wra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtled ſo with the Angel he prevailed) or otherwiſe by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, but certain it was that he wept when he did wraſtle: There are many ridiculous conceits of the Jews, and ſome old Writers about this, they ſay it was <note place="margin">A Jewiſh fiction.</note> the Angel that fell a weeping, and prayed <hi>Jacob</hi> to let him alone, thus they carry it; But to take it generally as our Divines do, that <hi>Jacob</hi> wept, and made ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo prevailed with God, <hi>Iacob's</hi> heart was preſt in the condition that he was in, and ſo preſt, that it cauſed tears to bubble from him, and no mervail though tears came from him, his heart could not but be full, for when he came to think thus with himſelf, What, after I have ſerved ſuch a hard ſervice under <hi>Laban</hi> my Uncle, and God bad me come away from him, which I took to be ſuch a great mercy from God to deliver me, yet how ſoon was I preſently in danger of my life, even my Uncle <hi>Laban</hi> purſuing of me, and God delivered me there; And muſt I now fall into the hand of my Brother? is the day come for him now to have his rage upon me? I ſee little other likelihood, his ſtrength is great, and God himſelf appears againſt me, and I have been wraſtling a great while, and I can get nothing from God, but that it's likely here I muſt die and periſh, yea, and that God ſhould leave me thus as he doth, that God ſhould appear a greater enemy to me than my Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> and lame me: Oh! now might not this be a ſign that God intends to deſtroy me, yea, God would be gone too when I am
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:43340:143"/>
in ſuch a ſtrait as this is; Oh! this makes him weep. As a poor child when it is in ſtraits and is crying to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the mother beats it and ſtrikes it, yea, the mother <note place="margin">Simile.</note> will be gone and leave it in thoſe ſtraits; Can you blame the child though it cry? So it was here, <hi>Jacob</hi> was in ſtraits, and was ſeeking God, and God beats him and makes him cry, and would be gon; Oh! this doth preſs tears out of the eyes of <hi>Jacob,</hi> Oh! what will become of me now? As if <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould have ſaid, Were it that I ſhould periſh alone it were not ſo much, but my Wives periſh, and how can mine eyes be able to ſee their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? yea, it may be they will be raviſhed before mine eyes by theſe rude Soldiers: Theſe kind of workings in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ſpirit you cannot but conceive that it muſt draw tears; he wept before the Angel, conſidering this his ſore diſtreſſed condition.</p>
                  <p>And on the other ſide, there were thoughts would make him weep too, The thoughts of his <hi>Miſery,</hi> and the reaſoning of his <hi>Faith,</hi> when he conſidered; I, but ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I am in the way of God though I be in a great deal of danger, I have the Promiſe of God, I have his Covenant with me, I have to deal with the Holy, Bleſſed and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God in all my waies, Who knows but that my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity may be Gods opportunity? The heart of my brother it is certainly in the hand of God, and all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are in Gods hands too: Now the actings of Faith would make one to weep aſwel as of Fear and Trouble, and it were well if we could weep on both ſides: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times you roul in your thoughts all the aggravations of your afflictions, and they make you weep: Now can you roul in your thoughts the aggravations of Gods Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Mercy, and can that make you weep? The end why God brought <hi>Jacob</hi> into this condition, to fal a wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping before the Angel, it was, That he might humble him, and break his heart before he gives him deliverance; for it was one of the greateſt honors (as we intimated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:43340:143"/>
that God did for <hi>Jacob,</hi> that ever he did to man, therfore God would bring him very low before he would raiſe him ſo high, and make him fall a weeping aſwel as praying before he ſhould have the Mercy; Oh! this is Gods way, He will bring men very low, to humble them before they ſhall have mercy, therefore when mens hearts are high and lofty, ſtout and hard, they are not in a way of Mercy from God; but when mens hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to break, thaw and melt, and are tender, then they are in a way of mercy, as here; So we find it often in Scripture that God intending mercy, firſt breaks the heart and melts it by mourning and ſorrowing; as <hi>Joſiah,</hi> you know that was his condition, his heart <hi>melted when he heard the Law,</hi> and God ſends preſently a Promiſe of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to him: and in <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> there the Lord promiſes his People, <hi>That he will bring them with weeping, and with ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,</hi> that ſhall be the way.</p>
                  <p>One Note or two more: <hi>It becomes the moſt generous and magnanimous ſpirit, to have his heart breaking, and to expreſs</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>his heart breaking with tears before God;</hi> It is an excellent thing to ſee a man of a brave ſpirit, ſtrong and ful of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in any ſervice of God, and yet when he comes to have to deal with God, to have a melting, tender and ſoft ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in his dealings with God. If you ſhould ſee now a great Captain or General that were brave and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous when he was abroad in the field about any difficult work, but when he comes before God in Prayer, there he can weep like a child, there he can mourn and lament, and his heart break aſſoon as a child; this is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpirit now, ſpirits that can turn according to what God cals them to, this way or that way, can be ſtout and hardy in a work that requires ſtoutneſs, and can be ſoft tender and yeelding in ſuch a work that requires ſuch things: Thus was our father <hi>Jacob:</hi> Oh! to have tender hearted Captains and Generals, to have couragious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, yet broken hearted ſpirits, to mix the work of Grace
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:43340:144"/>
thus it is moſt excellent, and it becomes the moſt braveſt ſpirit in the world, not only to fall down to prayer, but to weep before the Lord; ſome men think it's too low a thing to fall a weeping in prayer, as if it were a woma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and a childiſh thing; Oh! it's an argument that thy heart is carnal and baſe to think, that it's for want of underſtanding, I ſay, this is evil, and it comes from much corruption in the heart for to think it either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath a brave ſpirit, or beneath a prudent ſpirit; I'le give you one example that weeping is not beneath a <note place="margin">Weeping ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to an high ſpirit.</note> brave ſpirit, this is enough, and alſo that of <hi>David,</hi> no man did ſhed more tears in the preſence of God than <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> that brave Captain; but to put both together, I'le ſet before you the example of Jeſus Chriſt, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7. the text ſaith, <hi>That in the daies of his fleſh he offered up pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers and ſupplications,</hi> (how?) <hi>with ſtrong cries and tears:</hi> even Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God, God bleſſed for ever, he that was equal with the Father, the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> he that had all ſtrength and power, and had all the treaſures of wiſdom hid in him, and the fulneſs of the God head dwelt bodily in him, and yet when he had to deal with the Father, he offers up prayers, with ſtrong cries and tears. Doth it become the Captain of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in his ſeeking of God to weep? know then, it is not unbecoming any man or woman: Are you of the ſeed of <hi>Jacob?</hi> then when you would prevail with God labor to work your hearts even ſo as you may expreſs your affections, outwardly labor to do it in prayer, it will help to break thy heart: As a broken heart will cauſe outward expreſſions, ſo outward expreſſions will be a further cauſe to break the heart. And work thy heart by all arguments thou canſt to come to that tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſoftneſs, that thou mayeſt be like the Captain of thy Salvation, when thou art crying to God to cry e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with tears before him, and when thy heart is ſo bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with tears, then exerciſe thy faith upon the prayer
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:43340:144"/>
of Jeſus Chriſt. Now it is through the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt that my heart doth thus break, but I do not reſt upon theſe, God forbid that I ſhould reſt upon my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements, upon my breakings; No, but I will reſt upon the breakings of Jeſus Chriſt, who in the daies of his fleſh did ſend up mighty cries with tears to God, and was heard, he prevail'd.

                  <p>When we come to prayer, we muſt not have words, <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> that are puft-up words, and have little in them, but there muſt be as much ſence of the thing that we pray for, as the words that we ſpeak do ſeem to import &amp; carry with them; many times we have <hi>great</hi> words, and <hi>little</hi> ſence, and that makes our prayers to be ſo empty.</p>

tenſe</hi> in the Hebrew, and it's more according to the ſcope of the place, to reade them as you have them in your books, <hi>He found him in</hi> Bethel, <hi>and there he ſpake with us.</hi> That is, He found <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Bethel,</hi> and ſpake to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and in ſpeaking to <hi>Jacob,</hi> he ſpake unto us all.</p>
                  <p>Now for the opening of this Hiſtory, and the ſhewing <note place="margin">Expoſ.</note> how it ſutes with the ſcope of the Prophet in this place. We reade in Scripture of two Meetings that God and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> had together at <hi>Bethel,</hi> and this Text in <hi>Hoſea</hi> doth refer to them both, God finds him in <hi>Bethel</hi> two times and ſpake with <hi>Jacob,</hi> and ſpake to us both thoſe times.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt time for fear of danger he fled from his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">1.</note> when his brother had miſchievous thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, after he got the bleſſing from him.</p>
                  <p>And the Second time (again) after his wraſtling with <note place="margin">2.</note> the Angel God meets him in <hi>Bethel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Firſt of theſe you have in <hi>Gen</hi> 28. 10. and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond in <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 1. and ſo on. And it's neceſſary to refer to thoſe two Scriptures for the interpretation of this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, you will not know what it means elſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He finds him in <hi>Bethel, Gen.</hi> 28. 10. yea indeed, for <hi>Jacob</hi> he lay aſleep, with a ſtone under his head, he ſaw a viſion of Angels aſcending, and deſcending from Heaven and God ſpeak excellent things unto him. But the Note is,</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>of him:</hi> He comes unto his People in waies of mercy when they ſcarce dream of it: <hi>Jacob</hi> was but in a dream at this time, and yet God came in very wonderful waies of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy towards him.</p>
                  <p>Oh! how often hath God found us in this way? how <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> often may many of you ſay, that the Lord hath come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly to you in waies of mercy? that you never made account of ſuch mercies as you have met withal. Oh! when unexpected mercies come, we ſhould conſider that God found us, whereas our ſins might have found
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:43340:147"/>
us; but the mercies of God have found us out.</p>
                  <p>And the other time that God found <hi>Jacob,</hi> it was when <note place="margin">2</note> he was in great diſtreſs, after his daughter <hi>Dinah</hi> had been defloured, and his ſons <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that great outrage againſt the <hi>Shechemites,</hi> ſo great an outrage as to kill the City, and upon that <hi>Jacob</hi> and all his family was in great danger of being deſtroyed, for the act was ſo foul, that it could not but make all the people (as <hi>Jacob</hi> thought) to abhor him, and would be a cauſe that they ſhould all riſe againſt him, and utterly to cut him off, therfore in <hi>Gen. 34 30. Jacob</hi> tels his ſons, that they had made him to <hi>ſtink among the inhabitants of the Land,</hi> ſo that he was afraid they would gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and deſtroy him and his houſe; no queſtion the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs that <hi>Jacob</hi> was in, was very great, that his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould be defloured by the uncircumciſed ones, and that his two ſons ſhould commit ſuch an outrage, and ſhould endanger him to be deſtroyed utterly by them; For, who would have thought but that all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Land ſhould have riſen againſt him, and have cut him off? Now the next thing that we hear of, God meets with him at <hi>Bethel,</hi> and ſpeaks very gracious things to him there, and he did not only ſpeak to <hi>him,</hi> but there he ſpake with <hi>us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, God meeting with <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Bethel,</hi> that which he ſpake to him there concern'd us aſwel as it concern'd <hi>Jacob.</hi> An expreſſion to the ſame purpoſe we have in <hi>Pſal. 66. 6. He turned the Sea into dry land: they went through the Floud on foot: there We did rejoyce in him:</hi> For indeed the mercy of God towards the <hi>Iſralites</hi> at that time that did rejoyce them, was a matter of Rejoycing for us. Whatſoever is written, is written for our learning, 'tis as if God ſpake to us: That which God ſpake to <hi>Abraham, [I am God Alſufficient; walk before me, and be upright]</hi> he ſpake that to us, he ſpake that to thee and me. That that God ſpake to <hi>Joſhua, I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee;</hi>

that the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> applies to the Chriſtians at that time: that he ſpake to us, he ſpake it to thee and me; if we be BELEEVERS, that that God ſpake to the diſtreſſed and afflicted ones in <hi>Pſal. 102. He will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the prayer of the deſtitute, and not deſpiſe their prayer,</hi> that he ſpake to us, for in ver. 18. <hi>This ſhall be written for the Generations to come.</hi> And that which God ſpake to <hi>Jacob</hi> at theſe two ſeveral times in <hi>Bethel,</hi> it's written for the Generations to come, it's written for us, Well then, what was it? What was the ſpecial thing that God ſpake to <hi>Jacob</hi> when he found him at <hi>Bethel?</hi> and what was that <note place="margin">What God ſpake to <hi>Iacob</hi> and to us at <hi>Bethel.</hi>
                     </note> to us? I'le ſhew you many things, There are nine or ten notable things to be obſerved by us, which God ſpake unto us:</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing that he ſpake to <hi>Jacob</hi> that concerns us as well as himſelf was this, <hi>That the foundation of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>of the Saints it is in the Covenant of God.</hi> That he ſpake to us there, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 13. when he appeared to <hi>Jacob,</hi> what ſaid he to him? <hi>I am the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the God of</hi> Iſaac; <hi>Jacob</hi> was flying for his life then, and this was to comfort him in his danger, <hi>I am the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>thy Father, the God of</hi> Iſaac; then he ſpake this to us, that the foundation of the comforts of the Saints in the times of their diſtreſſes, it is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace that God hath made with them, and their fathers before them.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing was this, <hi>That the ſeed of</hi> Jacob <hi>are</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>the inheritors of the Land of</hi> Canaan; for ſo he told him, <hi>The Land wherein thou lieſt, I'le give to thee, and to thy ſeed.</hi> Now this concerns us, that the ſeed of <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhall inherit the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> That was typified by it. There are ſome that have a thought that yet there ſhall be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> by the faithful ſeed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> but however, this certainly he ſpake to us, that all the ſeed of <hi>Jacob</hi> are the Inheritors of the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> one way or other, take it in the <hi>Litteral,</hi> or in the <hi>Typical</hi> Senſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="265" facs="tcp:43340:148"/>
The Third thing was, <hi>God would have faith raiſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>in mercies promiſed, even when there is a great deal of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likelihood of the fulfilling of it;</hi> that's the Third thing he he ſpake of to us there; he tells <hi>Jacob</hi> there at that time when he was a poor, lone man, with his ſtaff, and no proviſion but a ſtone for his pillow, then he tells him of making good his promiſe, it was as unlikely a time as could be, a poor, lone man that <hi>Jacob</hi> was, went over with his ſtaff at that time, and that he ſhould have ſuch a Promiſe fulfill'd, and his ſeed to be ſo great, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the hand of <hi>Canaan,</hi> how unlikely was this? But God would have him to exerciſe his faith upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe at this time when there was ſuch a great unlikeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of it.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth thing is this, <hi>That the multiplying of the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Church is a great bleſſing,</hi> for ſaith he, thy ſeed ſhall be thus and thus, as the ſand of the Sea ſhore, I'le encreaſe my Church abundantly from thy loyns.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Promiſes defer'd, though they are to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <note place="margin">Obſ. 5.</note> upon as certain as ever they were, <hi>Yet the Saints of God have need of renewing of Promiſes, even thoſe that have moſt faith.</hi> God renews the ſame Promiſe to him that was made; before God had promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> to make his ſeed great, but the truth is, that the Promiſe though it be as certain as before, yet it had been a long time and there was little come of it.</p>
                  <p>And then the Sixth thing was this, <hi>That the bleſſing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>which comes to the world, it is by the Promiſed ſeed.</hi> He tels him that in his ſeed all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed; the great bleſſing of the world is, by the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeed, by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And then the Seventh thing was, <hi>That we Gentils were</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>in Gods heart, to do good unto us for thouſands of years ſince;</hi> Though at that time we were as Dogs, yet it was in Gods heart to bleſs us. Oh! this is a comfortable ſpeech to us, it concerns us Gentils in a more ſpecial manner, than it
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:43340:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>
did them that <hi>Hoſea</hi> did propheſie to at this time.</p>
                  <p>And then the Flighth thing is, <hi>That the Preſence of God and his Protection, is the only Encouragement of the Saints in their waies.</hi> For in Verſ. 15. ſaith God, <hi>Behold, I am with thee, and I will keep thee in all places whither thou goeſt;</hi> this he ſpake to us; this the Saints ſhould make high account of.</p>
                  <p>And then the Ninth thing is, <hi>That though Promiſes be not yet fulfilled, yet God is ſtill working towards their fulfilling;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 9</note> for ſo he tels him, I will not leave thee until I have don all that I have promiſed to thee, though you cannot ſee how my Adminiſtrations towards you do any way work for the fulfilling of my Promiſe, yet know I will not leave you until I have fulfilled my Promiſes.</p>
                  <p>And then the laſt thing is this which God ſpake to us there, he tels us of <hi>the conſtancy of his Mercy and faithfulneſs,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 10.</note> that however things may go with us here for a while, yet the mery of God continues, the line of Gods mercy is not cut aſunder, but his faithfulneſs is carried along <hi>till all the good that he hath promiſed, or that Faith can beleeve ſhal be granted to us,</hi> for ſo he tels <hi>Iacob</hi> there, I will not leave thee till I have done that which I have ſpoke to thee of. All this he ſpake with us. That's the firſt time of Gods meeting with <hi>Iacob</hi> in <hi>Bethel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Second time that he met with <hi>Iacob</hi> in <hi>Bethel,</hi> it is in <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 10. and there ſee what God ſpake with <note place="margin">The Second ſtory implied in the Text.</note> us, there God changes his Name to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms his Promiſe and Covenant to him again as before, God there remembers his prevailing with him, and his wraſtling with him, and in that God tells us he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers our ſervent prayers, after they are gone, yet his heart is upon them, there he confirm'd his name, <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and confirm'd his Promiſe; That's that he ſpake with us there too.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the Saints have need of the confirmation of mercies,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially <note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="267" facs="tcp:43340:149"/>
But then further, <hi>Gods preſenteng himſelf to the ſoul as</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>God Almighty, that's a great help to faith.</hi> I am God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, ſaith he there, thou haſt had experience of my Almighty power in turning the heart of thy Brother, and now thou art in a great danger. Becauſe thou art few in number, thou art afraid of the people of the Land, but I am God Almighty; There's little power in Thee, but there's great power in Me. The Conſideration of Gods Almighty power, is that that ſhould help the Saints in the mideſt of all their ſtraights and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>We find in Scripture that God very ſeldom when he ſpeaks of his Almighty Power, ſpeaks of his willingneſs to do them good, for that God would have his people take for granted, that's implyed in his Covenant that he made with them at firſt.</p>
                  <p>And then laſtly, When <hi>Iacob</hi> was afraid of being cut off becauſe he was few in number, now God preſents himſelf as God Almighty, and he bleſſes him now with fruitfulneſs, and tells him he will multiply him to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Nations, and Kings ſhall come out of his loyns; In this we have an excellent leſſon that God ſpeaks to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That God delights to receive his people in their fears with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſeaſonable mercies. Iacob</hi> was never in greater fears than at thoſe two times, yet now the Lord comes at this time of his great ſtraits, and tells him now of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying of him to many Nations, and that Kings ſhould come out of his loyns; at that time when he was afraid that the Nations ſhould come and deſtroy all that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to him, at that time God tells him that Kings ſhould come out of his loyns: Oh! the Lord delights to revive his people in their fears, and doth come with ſutable mercies to them.</p>
                  <p>Oh it ſhould teach us to be tender-hearted towards the <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> Saints that are in ſears and troubles, and to labor to
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:43340:150"/>
comfort our Brethren with ſeaſonable and ſutable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, <hi>And eſpecially after great conflicts,</hi> that's obſervable; for <hi>Jacob</hi> had been wraſtling with God not long before, and after theſe great conflicts God comes with the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of great mercies, this God ſpake to us there, <hi>That we ſhould not be diſcouraged, though God bring us into great conflicts;</hi> becauſe after thoſe times are the ſeaſons for God to ſpeak the moſt comfortable, and the moſt encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging things unto us. <hi>There God ſpake to us.</hi> So you ſee the Third Story thus opened unto you, and the uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, I know ſcarce a Scripture fuller than theſe two verſes.</p>
                  <p>And the Reaſon why the Prophat brings this Third Story to upbraid this people is this; as if he ſhould ſay thus;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Your Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> he worſhiped the true God in <hi>Bethel;</hi> you worſhip the Calf in <hi>Bethel,</hi> (For you know <note place="margin">The ſcope of the Text.</note> that in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> the Calves were ſet up) as if the Prophet ſhould ſay, Are you the Children of <hi>Jacob?</hi> did <hi>Jacob</hi> worſhip an Idol in <hi>Bethel?</hi> No, God found him in <hi>Bethel,</hi> and God ſpake with him there; but you Worſhip a Calf in <hi>Bethol.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, God made gracious promiſes to your father <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Bethel,</hi> you flight them, you regard them not, you go to ſhifting courſes for your ſelves and dare not rely upon Promiſes as your Father <hi>Jacob</hi> did.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, You pollute the place that God had made his Houſe, that place where there were ſuch gracious manifeſtations of God, you pollute it. It's an aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin to ſin in thoſe places where God hath ſhewed much mercy.</p>
                  <p>And then laſtly, You are gone from the Covenant that your Father <hi>Jacob</hi> made with God at <hi>Bethel,</hi> your Father <hi>Jacob</hi> (as God renewed his Covenant) enters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenant himſelf with God at <hi>Bethel,</hi> and ſaith, that the Lord ſhould be his God; But have not you forſaken

                  </p>

That which you ſee this morning, may put you in mind a little of it, yet I ſhall not ſpeak much of it now, Becauſe you that have been Auditors here, and others too, may know, that even in this place I have preached upon that Title, <hi>The Lord of Hoſts,</hi> That glorious Name <note place="margin">Lord of Hoſts. <hi>[The glorious Name of the Lord of Hoſts:</hi> the Title of a Book of the Authors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the firſt in <hi>defence</hi> of the Wars on the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſide]</note> of God, the Lord of Hoſts, and likewiſe publiſhed it, I opened that Title ſome yeers ſince, becauſe God did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to <hi>England</hi> in that Title, the Lord of Hoſts more fully than in former times. Therefore to the end that we in this Land might learn now to ſanctifie that Name of God, <hi>The Lord of Hoſts,</hi> I endeavored to open it as I was able unto you, to ſhew what glory of God was in that Name, that we might ſanctifie it; and ſince that time the Lord hath given us more occaſion to ſanctifie that Name of his than formerly, indeed this Title, <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> as well as <hi>Iehovah</hi> is the Memorial of God, and ſhould be to the poſterity that remains, we ſhould tell the poſterity after how the Lord hath manifeſted himſelf the Lord of Hoſts among us; if ever God appeared in the Glory of this Title in any Country and Nation, then he hath done it here: It is from the Lord of Hoſts that our Armies have prevailed ſo as they have done; one that hath but half an eye (as we uſe to ſay) can ſee it. Had God wrought our Victory by a company <hi>of Old, Brave, Gallant Soldiers,</hi> and by <hi>Mighty Armies,</hi> then the Glory of God as the Lord of Hoſts had been ecclipſed in ſome meaſure, but when as ſuch great things have been done, as ſcarce any ſtory can tell us, ſince <hi>Ioſhua</hi>'s time, the great things that have been done as have been here in this Kingdom within this twelve months, I ſay the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ſtory it will be, of what hath been done, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we reade of in any ſtories.

ſo contemptible in the eye of fleſh and blood as this <note place="margin">The New-Model at firſt</note> our Army was, it is no other than the Lord of Hoſts that hath appeared for us.</p>
                  <p>And in that God hath manifeſted himſelf by his own people ſo much; I will give you one Scripture which I do not remember I made uſe of then, to ſhew you what the Hoſts of God are beſides the Angels, there's the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and Sun, and Moon, and Stars, and the wholeworks of Creation, there are two ſpecial Armies that God hath <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gods</hi> Armies 1.</note> beſides the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and the works of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in general. There are two Armies, The <hi>Saints,</hi>

For that of the Angels I ſhall not need to give you Scripture.

that God is from himſelf; we come to underſtand almoſt all things that can be known of God by any light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by any Natural Underſtanding, beſides what you have by Divine Revelation, As the knowledge of God in Chriſt, that's above it; But the knowledg of God as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> knew him, and as the Creature can know him by any <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iehovah,</hi> Gods being of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. what it infers. 1</note> Natural light, there's moſt of all known from this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>That God hath his being from himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, From Himſelf follows, That he is the Firſt Being of all things.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From hence follows, That he is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream <note place="margin">2.</note> Being, he is above all.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, From hence follows, That he is an Eternal <note place="margin">3.</note> Being, he can have no begining, becauſe it is from Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, From hence follows, That he is an Infinit <note place="margin">4</note> Being, that there's no bounds at all of his Being; for what ever is bounded is bounded by ſome thing that is without it; but God being from Himſelf, and having no cauſe, can have nothing to limit and bound his Being.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, From hence follows, That there is All Being <note place="margin">5</note> in God, whatever hath any being, it muſt be either that that is the Firſt, or from the Firſt, He is an abſolute Being of Himſelf, having it from Himſelf, and therefore Al Being is eminently contain'd in God Himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, From hence follows, That whatſoever is in <note place="margin">6.</note> God, is God Himſelf, from this Name <hi>Iehovah,</hi> He is an Abſolute Being, nothing but Himſelf: This is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between God and any Creature: Whatſoever is in the Creature, is not the <hi>being</hi> of the Creature. A man hath Wiſdom, now the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of a man is one, and the <hi>Eſteem</hi> of the man is another thing; but it is not ſo with God, whatſoever you can ſay of God, is God, the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, is God; the Mercy of God, is God; the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, is God Himſelf: and ſo all the Attributes:
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:43340:153"/>
we conceive of the Attributes as if they were diſtinct from the Being; when we ſay, God is wiſe, as if God were one thing, and Wiſdom were another; but certainly if we would apprehend God as in Himſelf, we cannot appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him ſo; As if his Wiſdom were one thing, and God another; or his Mercy one thing, and God another; ſo that the truth is, nothing can properly be <hi>predicated</hi> of God, becauſe when a thing is predicated there's a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the <hi>Subject</hi> and the <hi>Predicate,</hi> but there's <note place="margin">Nothing can be properly predicated of God.</note> no ſuch diſtinction in God; but whatſoever can be ſaid of God, is God Himſelf, and there's as much of the glory of God appears in this one thing, in this (I ſay) that <hi>all that is in God is God Himſelf.</hi> The underſtanding God thus doth help us to ſee God in his glory as much as any way <note place="margin">How to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive aright of God.</note> whatſoever, and few people apprehend this, but look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God as a Creature, and ſo they think God is ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing that hath ſo many Excellencies in him; but to underſtand, that all that is ſaid of God, is God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and therefore it is all but one being in God; it doth appear divers to us, Wiſdom, Mercy, Juſtice, Power, Life, Holineſs, and Faithfulneſs appears many things to us, but in God all is but one Excellency; As now, The beams of the Sun appear divers to us, they ſhine through a blue glaſs, and there's a blue reflection, and a <note place="margin">Simile.</note> green glaſs and then 'tis green, and a red glaſs and then 'tis red, but all one beam: So the Infinit, Firſt, Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Being of al things appearing in the ſeveral workings of His, in the ſeveral Adminiſtrations of His, this way or that way, ſeem to be ſeveral, but it's all but one being that is in himſelf: and this is ſignified by the Name <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And further; By the Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> is ſignified to us, That all the being of the Creature depends upon God, <note place="margin">7</note> is from God originally, and ſo depends upon God every <note place="margin">The name <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,</hi> what it ſhold remind us of.</note> moment, every time you hear the Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> you ſhould be put in mind of this, That as all creatures had
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:43340:153"/>
what they had from God at firſt, ſo they do abſolutely depend upon God every moment for their being, and for all the good they have.</p>
                  <p>And then laſtly, In this Name is ſignified thus much, <note place="margin">8</note> That the Lord will give a being unto all his Promiſes, and to all his Threatnings; And therefore when he did appear to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to tell him that he would fulfil the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to his people, to bring them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> then he doth tell him that indeed, though he did appear to <hi>Abraham</hi> by the name <hi>Elſhaddai, God-Alſufficient,</hi> yet he did not appear to him by the name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which is as much as if he ſhould ſay, yea indeed, when I ſpake to <hi>Abraham,</hi> I made a Promiſe to him, that I would give him ſuch a Land, and thus and thus, but I did not give a being to the Promiſes; but now I come to make way to the fulfilling of this Promiſe, now I appear to be <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,</hi> thus <hi>Jehovah</hi> is Gods memorial, that is, every time you reade of the name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> (it might very well be wiſh'd that the very word <hi>Jehovah</hi> had been kept in <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iebovah</hi> to be kept in the tranſlation.</note> your Engliſh Tranſlation, but almoſt alwaies when you reade the word <hi>Lord</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Alwaies when it is in capital letters as LORD, not when it is in other let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as <hi>Lord</hi>
                     </note> it is <hi>Jehovah)</hi> every time therefore you reade the name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or hear that name, then you ſhould meditate this, and contemplate of God, it will help your meditation of God very much, <hi>God Jehovah,</hi> the Lord he is a Being from himſelf, the Firſt-being that is the Supream of all, an Infinite being, that hath no bounds at all, it is he that is ſuch a God as is of himſelf, whatſoever is in him it is his own Eſſence, it is his Being, an Eternal Being, and from whom all creatures have Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and do depend, and it's he that will give a Being to all his Promiſes, ſo all his Threatnings, all this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Name <hi>Iehovah</hi> which is the memorial of God. And thus for the opening of theſe Two Names.</p>
                  <p>Now then for the Obſervations from them. The firſt is this,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Though God be never ſo ſtrong and terrible in himſelf, never</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note>
                     <pb n="286" facs="tcp:43340:154"/>
                     <hi>ſo great and glorious, yet faith hath ſtrength to wraſtle with this God,</hi> it's brought in to this end, <hi>Iacob</hi> he prevailed with God. God, what God? The Lord of Hoſts, <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> even this God that is the Lord of Hoſts, the Lord of all Armies, that hath al power, that is ſo terrible in all the Armies in Heaven and Earth, and is this <hi>Iehovah,</hi> this Infinite, Glorious, Supream, Eternal Firſt-being of all things? and yet <hi>Iacob</hi> wraſtles with this Lord of Hoſts, God <hi>Iehovah,</hi> and prevails with him.</p>
                  <p>So that hence Chriſtians ſhould learn, to raiſe up <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> their ſpirits when they have to deal with God, if God hath given them faith they ſhould not be daunted with Gods terror, or with Gods greatneſs; thou ſometimes lookeſt upon God as the great Creator of Heaven and Earth, the great Lord of Hoſts, the infinite <hi>Iehovah,</hi> the luſtre of his glory ſeems to amaze thee; be not afraid, Oh thou beleeving ſoul, if thou beeſt a ſeed of <hi>Iacob,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the terribleneſs there is in God, and all the glory that there is in God, the infinite diſtance that there is between him and us, which his Name <hi>Iehovah</hi> ſets out unto us, yet thou mayeſt wraſtle with this God, even with this God, and prevail with ſuch a God as this is. Many poor Chriſtians are much daunted, and diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the ſight of the greatneſs of God; but this text is a very great help to us that we ſhould not be daunted and diſcouraged with the apprehenſions of Gods great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; indeed it is for ungodly men, to whom God is an Enemy, they are to be daunted with the apprehenſion of the greatneſs of God; but to the ſeed of <hi>Iacob,</hi> even when <hi>Iacob</hi> prevailed it was with this God, that is the Lord of Hoſts, whoſe memorial is <hi>Iehovah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second thing is this, <hi>That the greatneſs and glory of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>God in theſe Names of his is a great aggravation of ſin:</hi> for to that end it's likewiſe brought to aggravate the ſin of this people in departing from this God. Oh! the Lord is infinitely terrible, he is the Lord of Hoſts, and he is <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi>
                     <pb n="287" facs="tcp:43340:154"/>
and yet you wretched creatures have departed from this God, you have ſinned againſt this God; Oh! 'tis a fearful aggravation of mens ſin, that their ſin is againſt ſuch a God that is the Lord of Hoſts, whoſe Name is <hi>Jehovah;</hi> there is nothing that can humble the ſoul of a ſinner more than the ſight of the Lord in his glorious <note place="margin">What hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually.</note> Attributes, when thou comeſt to know what a God it is thou haſt to deal with, this will make thee to ſee thy ſin to be great; therefore the Prophet ſets God in his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry before this people, that they ſhould come to ſee their great ſin, and that there ſhould be a ſtop given to the courſe of their hearts that were running on in the waies of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Which is very uſeful; <hi>Look what Glory and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Excellency of any Title, or Name, or Work that God hath ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in to our Forefathers, the ſame we may have God to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in to us, if we forſake him not:</hi> That's the Third end why the Prophet here brings theſe Titles, <hi>The Lord of Hoſts, Jehovah;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, He was thus to your Father <hi>Jacob, the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> and he was <hi>Jehovah;</hi> and his memorial is ſtill the Lord of Hoſts, and Jehovah, and therefore you might have this God to appear, the Lord of Hoſts for your good as well as he did to your Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and you might have God appear to be <hi>Jehovah</hi> for you as well as he did to <hi>Jacob,</hi> if you forſake him not; Oh! wretches, that you ſhould forſake this God whom you might have to be the Lord of Hoſts, and Jehovah to you.</p>
                  <p>Oh! Let's learn this, That when we reade in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <note place="margin">Uſe</note> or hear from our forefathers how God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared heretofore for his Saints, for our Forefathers, let us make this uſe of it, God is the ſame God ſtill, and we may come to have as much good from this God as ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny had ſince the world began, there's no ſhortning of his Power, there's no darkning of his Glory, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Power hath wrought, whatſoever Glory of God
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:43340:155"/>
hath appeared in former times, we may come to have it appear to us now, it's a mighty argument for people to keep cloſe to God and be faithful with him even becauſe of this.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>There's no need of Images to keep Gods remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance;</hi> the glorious Titles of God and his Attributes, <note place="margin">Obſ. 4.</note> and the Manifeſtation of Himſelf in his Works, is the beſt Memorial of God; that's <hi>our</hi> way, the way of man to make to himſelf Memorials. God hath made himſelf a Memorial. When you reade in the Word this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Title of God, <hi>Jehovah,</hi> it's a better Memorial of God than all the Images in the world are, and we may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sanctifie Gods Name, and have our hearts better wrought upon by ſuch Titles of God, than by all kind of Images whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>The Fifth Note, <hi>When God manifeſts himſelf in his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it's not only for the preſent that men now might ſee his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>but it is that he may be remembred from Generation to Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, from one to another, from one time of our life to another, and ſo from one Age to another;</hi> ſo here, <hi>the Lord of Hoſts, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah is his memorial,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, the Lord mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts himſelf Jehovah thus and thus, and he would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred in other Ages to be ſo; what God doth to his people in one Age, he doth not expect only to have his Name ſanctified for that preſent, but he would have it laid up from Age to Age, and would be honored in all Generations from thoſe great manifeſtations of himſelf in ſome one Age.</p>
                  <p>My Brethren, Oh! that we had hearts to do this, Oh! that we could make this God his Memorial, that we could lay up what God hath manifeſted of himſelf in <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> this Age for the benefit of another Age; I hope God wil one way or other provide means for the recording of the famous things that God hath done in this Age, that it may be a Memorial to the poſterity afterwards; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly our Age cannot give God the glory that is due
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:43340:155"/>
unto his Name for what he hath done, we had need la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to continue it to poſterity that the Ages to come may remember what God hath done to give glory to him, it is his Memorial.</p>
                  <p>And then the laſt Note is this, <hi>When we would have a</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>holy Memorial of God, the meditation of the Name JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH is very uſeful for us.</hi> You that ſay you cannot me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, your meditations are barren; Would you help your ſelves in meditation to have a holy Memorial of God, think much of the Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> remember what hath been hinted to you from that Name, and what is contained in it; And thus much for the Fifth Verſe.</p>

                  <p>For the Firſt, The reference it hath to their father <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> affords us this Note, <hi>That the conſideration of our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Predeceſſors, of our Forefathers that were godly, to whom God appear'd in Mercy, is a great argument to turn us to God.</hi> Oh! you that are Children, that have had Parents that were wraſtlers with God, Are you wicked now?

                  <p>The Second is this, <hi>That the conſideration of God, to be the LORD of Hoſts, is a mighty motive to cauſe us to turn to God:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 2.</note> Wilt thou go on in waies of enmity againſt the Lord of Hoſts, the Lord of Hoſts who hath Angels and all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to fight for him? Wilt thou, a poor worm, ſtand out againſt this God? thou that goeſt on in a way of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, know, thou fighteſt againſt the great LORD of Hoſts. What were it for a drunken fellow to come and think to oppoſe but ſuch an Army as we have that goes out of the City at this time? but for a poor wretched <note place="margin">Simile.</note> worm to think to ſtand againſt the Infinit GOD, the <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> Oh! 'tis infinit boldneſs, and preſumption, and deſperate madneſs in that man; therefore turn to the Lord: All the while thou art going on in waies of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, thou art fighting againſt the Lord of Hoſts.</p>
                  <p>And on the other ſide, If thou hadſt but an heart to turn unto the Lord, Oh how joyful would this Title be to thee, that that God which is thy God, is the Lord of Hoſts, is the Lord of all the Hoſts in the World: We are not afraid now to ſee Soldiers, and hear the beating of Drums, and ſhooting of Guns, when we know that all are our Friends; but if we ſhould have heard the beating <note place="margin">Simile.</note> of Drums, and neigbing of Horſes, and ſhooting of Guns of our Enemies, that would have ſtruck fear: So, one that hath turned to God need not fear any Army, any Creatures, Why? for all is commanded by God their Father, and Oh! the joy, peace and ſecurity that a heart may have that is turned to God.

                     <hi>ſerve, ſaying, Fear not,</hi> Paul. Mark, There ſtood before me the Angel of God. Did not that terrifie him? The Angel that is but one of the Members of the Hoſts of God, any one Angel hath a great deal of terror in him ſometimes, for there is much of the glory of God in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and we know that the appearing of Angels hath ſtruck terror into many men: But now ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> The Angel ſaid, <hi>Fear not;</hi> If it be the Angel of God, whoſe I am, and whom I ſerve, then I need not fear; yea, let God muſter up all his Hoſts, and appear to one that hath turned to him, if he can ſay thus, Whoſe I am, and whom I ſerve, theſe Hoſts will ſay, Fear not. Therefore turn unto the Lord, becauſe he is the Lord of Hoſts.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Becauſe God is JEHOVAH, therefore turn</hi>

                     </note> God, I ſay, put all together that we reade in the Book of God, yet if we did but throughly underſtand the Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> we ſhould ſee as much terror in it to a guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and a ſinful ſoul that goes on in the waies of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, as almoſt all that is mentioned of God that might be terrible.

Do but conſider how ſome little creature, if it be in ſome part of a mans body, what power it hath to bring torment, a little gravel in the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, or ſtone in the bladder, that's but a poor weak creature in its ſelf, but being in that place, what tortor
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:43340:157"/>
doth it bring! now if a little gravel or ſtone hath that power to torment thee, then what power hath all things in the Earth, and the infinite God that hath all eſſence, and all being, and can diſpoſe of all things as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to bring pain, miſery, and torment to a ſinner? It's a very humbling conſideration to a ſinner.</p>
                  <p>And on the other ſide, If there be any power in any <note place="margin">And whrt Conſolation.</note> thing that hath a being, to bring any comfort to a man or woman, it's all in God, for God hath all in him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently; As now, one Creature hath power to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in one way, another in another way; and ſo one Creature hath power to comfort us one way, another another, but all this is eminently in God, the gravel torments one way, the humor in the veins in the gout that torments another way, and fire torments another way, and the Sword torments after another manner, and burning feaver torments in the body, fire without, and burning feaver within, the ſtinging of Serpents torments after another way; now all power of all things is in God <hi>Eminently,</hi> the quinteſſence of all things is in God, and therefore the power of God is able to bring all ſorts of torments at one time in one thing; As now, ſuppoſe ſeveral herbs that have ſeveral vertues, one hath a vertue in one kind, another in another, but if theſe herbs were all diſtill'd into one water, then a drop of that water hath the ſame vertue and efficacy that it <note place="margin">
                        <hi>A</hi> fit ſimile.</note> may be forty ſeveral herbs hath; ſo now, all creatures that have their ſeveral kind of efficacies and vertues diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into one, If I may compare this diſtillation unto God, he hath all kind of power in himſelf, and is able to put it forth in one inſtant, all the power and efficacie that there is in all creatures in Heaven and Earth, either to torment, or to comfort us, If one herb hath one ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a ſecond another, and the third another, the diſtillation of them all together, how ſweet will that be? Now all theſe being in God eminently, Oh what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

is there in God than to the ſoul! So that look ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to the Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> we may ſee an argument to humble us for ſin, the dreadfulneſs of the wrath of God appears in this, more than in any one meditation <note place="margin">The Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the name <hi>Iehovah.</hi>
                     </note> that I know of. Neither do I know any meditation that may ſtick upon the heart to comfort and encourage the heart to turn to God and to rejoyce in God ſo much as this, That there's all being in God eminently, and all depending abſolutely upon him; therefore turn to God, becauſe he is <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Thus you ſee the connexion of theſe two.</p>
                  <p>Further, <hi>When the excellency of the Saints, or glory of God</hi>

                  <p>But they might ſay, <hi>Do not we turn to God? we do ſerve God.</hi>

Turn Thou to God therefore. Do not thou look upon others, and think thus, I do as others do, yea, but thou haſt more reaſon to turn to God than others. There are more arguments to perſwade thy heart than others, <hi>Turn Thou to God.</hi> And this is a great mercy of God towards any man or woman, when as God ſhall dare powerfully thoſe ſpecial conſiderations and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">A mercy, for God to ſpeak particularly to a ſoul.</note> that concern their ſouls to turn to God; a man or woman comes to hear the Word, and hears the nature of Repentance, &amp; the motives to Repentance, but that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally concerns all, and this doth not much ſtir the heart, but at another time it pleaſeth God to hint ſomething out of the Word that concerns them in particular, and <note place="margin">Particulars affect moſt.</note> this gives a mighty turn to their hearts more than all the other; As if a man be aſleep, though there be a great noiſe, perhaps this doth not awaken him, but let one

come and call him by his name, <hi>Thomas,</hi> or <hi>Richard,</hi> or <hi>John,</hi> and ſpeak particularly to him, and that will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken him when a greater noiſe will not do it: ſo though there be general arguments of turning to God, it doth not ſo much prevail with people, as when God ſpeaks to men and women by name, and ſaies, Turn <hi>thou</hi> to God.

                  <p>Many men in ſome good moods (obſerve it) Oh how <note place="margin">Obſ.</note> pitiful are they! how merciful are they! but come to them at another time, and Oh! how ridged are they then! Oh! how ſowr are they! how bitter, how cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el! how harſh are they! We have found it ſo by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, you can ſay, ſuch a man, Oh! what ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe had we together, and what a ſweet temper'd man he was, how loving, how meek, how gentle, how pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful! But come to him now, how harſh, and how rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in his expreſſions, and extream bitter, mightily turned as if he were not the man; keep Mercy, keep it. Doth God at any time melt thy heart, and make thee apprehenſive of thy need of mercy? doth thy heart begin to bleed towards thy Brethen? Oh! keep it, keep this temper; the Lord keep this in the thoughts and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of thy heart for ever, Oh take heed of change of heart. It ſhould be the care of Chriſtians, not only to do that that is good, but to keep their hearts in ſuch a conſtant frame. Oh that ſome of you would but call to mind the dales of old, Was there not a time that your hearts did melt towards your brethren, and had ſweet converſe and communion with them, what's become of thoſe ſpirits now? Oh! turn to that gracious, ſweet, temper again, and if ever God bring you to that temper again, keep it; Conſider what is it that hath changed my heart, what hath brought me to it; now if God doth <note place="margin">Note.</note> diſcover how thou haſt loſt that ſweetneſs of thy heart, Oh! labor to repent and turn to God, and reſolve, if ever God bring me to that temper again (as ſometimes through his mercy I have felt) I hope through his Grace that I ſhall keep my ſelf in that temper; Oh how happy were it with us if when God brings our hearts into a good temper if we had but hearts to keep them in that temper, <hi>keep Mercy.</hi>

                  <p>In ſome acts you ſhall find men very juſt, and take them in other acts and there they will be falſe enough. But now, It ſhould be our care, to be as it's ſaid of God in <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 6, 7. God is ſaid there to be the <hi>habitation of Juſtice,</hi> ſo it ſhould be in the Courts of Juſtice, there ſhould be the habitation of Juſtice. Perhaps ſometimes, in ſome one Cauſe a man may have Juſtice in a Court: <note place="margin">Courts of Juſtice.</note> yea, but if it be not ſo in <hi>all</hi> Cauſes, at <hi>all</hi> times, there is not the keeping of Juſtice; Juſtice ſhould be alwaies at home: ſometimes you may come to a Court and not find Juſtice at home, but it's gone abroad, but it ſhould be alwaies the habitation of Judgment. And ſo it ſhould be in Families, and in particular Perſons; It may be at ſome times thou wert juſt in thy waies, yea, but then thou hadeſt not a temptation, the tempration came not <note place="margin">Families.</note> for unjuſt dealing: There are ſome men that by a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation are brought to ſuch unjuſt dealing, that if a man ſhould have ſaid ſome divers yeers ago, that thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt have done ſuch things, you would have been ready to think, <hi>Am I a dog, that I ſhould do ſuch things?</hi> but now, when a man is once engaged in any unjuſt way, then he muſt go on: and therefore <hi>keep Judgment.</hi> It follows;
<q>Keep Judgment, and wait on thy God continually.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That's thus, <hi>Do not ſatisfie your ſelves in duties of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Text</note>

                     <hi>and Judgment only, but worſhip God;</hi> For by waiting on God is meant the exerciſe of ſpiritual Graces, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Worſhip of God conſiſts, wherein we come to make God to be our God: As it is not enough for men to think they worſhip God, and yet make no conſcience of the Second Table; ſo neither is it enough for men to make conſcience of the Second Table, and not to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God. It may be there is ſom of you that are very juſt,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:43340:162"/>
yea, but what worſhip of God is there in your Families, and in your own hearts? Do your ſouls worſhip God, and ſanctifie the Name of God in all your waies? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is added, <hi>Turn to the Lord thy God, and keep Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Judgment, and wait on thy God continually.</hi>
                     <q>Wait on God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The baſes, or foundation of waiting, <hi>is Faith,</hi> Beleeve <note place="margin">How we ar to wait on God. 1.</note> there is good in God, help, ſupply here, and that in God alone; however things ſeem to be contrary, let things go how they will, I beleeve there is help in God alone, and not in thoſe former baſe waies that I have taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that my corrupt heart hath led me into, here's help, and not in the other way.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Waiting on God, is, To attend God in the uſe of what means God hath appointed for the attaining <note place="margin">2.</note> of ſuch a thing that I expect from him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A looking out for Mercy; I beleeve here is <note place="margin">3.</note> Mercy and no where elſe, I attend on God for it in the uſe of theſe means, and I look out for mercy.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I quietly ſubmit in the mean time, though <note place="margin">4</note> God ſtaies long; that's to wait, ſo as not to be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, not to have my heart ſink, though God ſtaies long.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, I keep in the way of ſeeking of God all the <note place="margin">5.</note> while: That ſoul that doth this, may be ſaid to wait on God.</p>
                  <p>A turning heart to God is a heart that is a waiting <note place="margin">Obſ.</note> heart, the heart that turns truly to God is taken off from all Creature contentments, ſo as to reſt in them, and looks up to God for all help, and for all ſupply. And this waiting is of very great uſe to thoſe that are turning to God, Conſider of it, Is any of you about the work of turning to God? hath God begun to make a turn to any of your hearts? Know, that when you are <note place="margin">Uſe for new Converts</note>
                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:43340:163"/>
turning to God, you are very like to meet with a great many things that may diſcourage you, many ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Devil and your own hearts; Why ſhould not I go back again? what good have I gotten by reading, and praying? I get nothing by it, and all will come to nothing at laſt, Temptations are like to come thick and three-fold upon the heart of a ſinner turning to God: I am confident I am ſpeaking in this to the hearts of all that knows what it is to turn unto God, there was a time that thou wert departing from God, and then thou wenteſt on <hi>quietly,</hi> but ever ſince the time that God hath begun to turn thy heart, Oh! the thick, and three fold temptations of the Devil that come to thee! Now this is a very ſeaſonable exhortation, turn to God and wait upon him, be not diſcouraged not withſtanding all difficulties, fears, temptations, and diſcouragements, from Men, and Devils, and thine own heart, yet wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God and keep in his way.</p>
                  <p>Oh! it had been happy that this exhortation had been ſet home upon the ſpirits of many that the Lord was <note place="margin">Applie. to ſome back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliders.</note> beginning to give a turn to their hearts, not long ſince the Lord was beginning to turn thy heart to himſelf, and thou metteſt with ſome things that diſcouraged thee which hath turned thee quite off again, Oh! had but this exhortation come ſeaſonably then, <hi>Turn to the Lord, and wait upon him,</hi> Oh! it had been happy for thee. The Lord make it ſeaſonable now to thee, Oh! remember this text, <hi>Turn to God, and wait upon him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wait.]</hi> Oh! there's reaſon that thou ſhouldeſt wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, Oh! thou ſaieſt if I had comfort, and if I were ſure I ſhould be ſaved at laſt, though I have diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from men, yet, if I had but comfort from God, then I could be content; yea, but wait, wait for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, wait for peace, wait for aſſurance, <hi>God is a great God,</hi> and is worthy to be waited on: <note place="margin">Why we ſhould wait. 1</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men that are above others will take ſtate upon them,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:43340:163"/>
and they will be waited on; God is great, and therefore wait upon him.</p>
                  <p>And we are vile creatures and unworthy, and therfore <note place="margin">2. Simile.</note> let us wait. Beggers if they ſhould rap and rap, and you come and ſee it to be a begger, your heart riſes upon him, if he beg he muſt wait if you be buſie. We are Beggers, and therefore it is fit for us to wait.</p>
                  <p>And Thirdly, God hath waited on us a long time, <note place="margin">3.</note> how long did God wait upon thee, it may be thou wert twenty yeers old before thou dideſt begin to turn to God, perhaps thou wert thirty or fortie yeers old and God was waiting upon thee to be gracious all that time, God was waiting for opportunity to do thee good, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wait thou upon God.</p>
                  <p>And Fourthly, What we wait for, it is worth our <note place="margin">4.</note> waiting. If a man did beleeve there were nothing but ſcraps to be had at laſt, then he would not wait ſo long; but if he did hope there was ſome great thing to be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, then he would wait: Beggers if they come to ſome <note place="margin">Simile.</note> mean houſe, they knock at the door and ſtay a little, and if they give them nothing, away they will go; but if they come to great Houſes, or Coaches, they will wait though it be long, and run a great way after them. So, that which we wait for, it is worth thouſands of worlds, <note place="margin">What we wait for.</note> we wait for the pardon of Sin, and wait for the aſſurance of Gods Love, we wait for the ſhedding abroad of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt in our hearts, we wait for rich Treaſure, and know that there is enough to be had in God; your waiting will pay for all.</p>
                  <p>Know alſo, 'Tis a great part of Gods Worſhip to wait <note place="margin">5.</note> upon him, 'tis not the Worſhip of God, only to Pray, and hear the Word, and receive Sacraments; but when you are waiting, you are worſhiping of God.</p>
                  <p>Further, God is all this while preparing mercy for <note place="margin">6.</note> you. Suppoſe you come to have a Scrivener write ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for you, Well, the thing is not yet done, yea, but <note place="margin">Simile.</note>
                     <pb n="306" facs="tcp:43340:164"/>
he is writing as faſt as he can: know, O thou ſoul who art turning to God, all the while thou art waiting, God is working, God is ſetting all his Attributes on work for thy good, while thou art waiting, and therefore wait on thy God.</p>
                  <p>And know, God is infinitly wiſe, and he knows when 'tis beſt for us to have the mercy, he knows the times and <note place="margin">7.</note> ſeaſons, wait upon God, for the Lord <hi>is a God of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Alas! we are haſty, we cannot judg when the time is fitteſt, but God <hi>is a God of Judgment,</hi> and therefore wait upon him: ſhould we have a mercy juſt when we would, our mercy would undo us, and therefore let us wait.</p>
                  <p>Oh my Brethren, we have as much encouragement here in this Land to wait upon God as ever any people had; we would fain have had the Wars ended, and we <note place="margin">England.</note> began to murmur and repine becauſe it was not done, Oh! but we will not wait, therefore we will not turn; and thoſe that turn to God leaſt, will wait leaſt upon him; and thoſe that turn to God moſt, will wait moſt upon him; Do not you ſee that God hath wrought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of good for us by deferring what we would <note place="margin">Note.</note> have? had we had no oppoſition at the beginning of the Parliament, and ſuppoſe the King and Parliament had agreed, and ſaid, You ſhall have your deſires, What would we have deſir'd, we would have deſir'd ſome few things, as taking away Ship-mony, Tonnage, and Poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, Monopolies, &amp;c. and to have a Triennial Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the like. Now what abundance hath God wrought by deferring what we would have had? Oh it is good for people to wait upon God, Oh let us look back to our murmurings and repinings all this while. It's true, we have ſuffered ſomething, yea, but hath not God wrought good out of our ſufferings? and ſuppoſe there ſhould be fears of new ſtorms ariſing.

                     <hi>Wait]</hi> It's fit for us to wait. Yea, but we have wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Expoſ.</note> a long time. Well, but yet know that you are at the right door: Suppoſe a man be knocking at a door, and he hath knockt a great while and no body comes, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to think it's not the the right door, but ſome body <note place="margin">Simile.</note> tells him that it is the right door, and then he ſtaies: ſo we may aſſure our heares thus much, we are at the right door certainly, and let us not think to go away, and we ſhall find ſomebody within, God wil appear at length, What, ſhal we loſe all for want of waiting a little while longer? Thus it is with many wretched Apoſtats, that <note place="margin">The folly of Apoſtats.</note> have taken a great deal of pains in ſeeking after God a great while, and for want of waiting a little longer they have loſt all: Oh! let there be this reſolution in your hearts, <hi>If I die and periſh, yet I'le die and periſh waiting upon God.</hi> Certainly that ſoul that hath this reſolution will never come to diſpair, yea, there's no ſuch way for the haſtening of Mercy, as for a ſoul to lie flat at the feet of God, let God do what he will with me, if I periſh, I'le periſh waiting upon him, though he kills me, I'le truſt in him, and ſtay upon him: You have waited, how long I pray? Oh! you have been waiting and ſeeking of God it may be this half year, or twelve months, What's that I pray? O thou wretched ſoul! thou haſt deſerved eternal flames, and wilt thou grudg at God for waiting a few years? If God would keep thee waiting <note n="*" place="margin">As he hath done divers</note> 
                     <hi>all thy daies,</hi> and at the laſt manifeſt Himſelf unto thee, thou hadſt cauſe to bleſs God for ever, and therfore do not grudge though thou haſt been waiting a while, and it may be though

Thy time is come, yet Gods time is not come, the time that you call long, God doth not call it ſo; <hi>One day with God is as a thouſand years,</hi> it's no time with God, and therefore do not complain of the length of thy time.</p>
                  <p>And your betters have waited longer; Reade but the 88. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and there you will find your better waited all <note place="margin">8.</note> his time; The Lord was pleaſed to work Grace upon him when he was yong, his heart was turned to God then; and you may find in the text, that from his youth up the terrors of God was upon him. <hi>Wait upon God continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</hi>

                  <p>And you cannot better your ſelf: Whither wilt thou go, poor ſoul? Now you are ſeeking God, you have not <note place="margin">9</note> what you would have, Whither will you go? Can you mend your ſelf any way? if you cannot, then wait upon God continually.</p>

they had brought contempt upon their own perſons: for though Merchants that are ſubtil may in the pride of their hearts rejoyce in their ſubtilty and cunning, and think that they can circumvent others by their deceipt, and get money that way in going beyond them; they may glory in this as if it were a great excellency in them, but the holy Ghoſt caſts contempt upon thoſe, he is a <hi>Merchant,</hi> a <hi>Cananite,</hi> and the <hi>ballances</hi> of <hi>deceipt</hi> are in his hand.</p>

                  <p>What oppreſſion is there in Trading? If I buy a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity and ſell it again, what oppreſſion can there be? <note place="margin">Oppreſſion in Trading.</note> There may be oppreſſion in Trading, As thus:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Oppreſſion in <hi>Monopolizing</hi> of Commodities, that <note place="margin">1. Monopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</note> poor men that have been brought up to ſuch a Trade, and that have no other livelihood at all but that, that a few men get into their own hand, and make ſuch uſe of it themſelves that poor men are not able to live by them, this is oppreſſion; Certainly this monopolizing in Trading is a great oppreſſion, the Lord hath in great meaſure delivered us, but not wholly delivered us from that, there is a great cry in many parts of the Land ſtill of that.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="314" facs="tcp:43340:168"/>
And then Secondly, <hi>Oppreſſion in Trading;</hi> when as <note place="margin">2.</note> men take the advantages of mens weakneſſes that they deale withall in their Trading: but eſpecially when they take advantages of mens neceſſiries, that is, If I know that ſuch a man muſt ſell his Commodity, now for men to take advantage of his neceſſity and therefore beat it down, ſo as even almoſt to undo a man becauſe he is neceſſitated for the ſelling of it. I verily beleeve you know the meaning of ſuch things as theſe are.</p>
                  <p>Or now, Thoſe that work upon the neceſſity in buying, as ſometimes when men bring over Commodities, and muſt bring over ſuch Commodities, you will let them lie to the laſt period, that ſo you may have them at any rate, and ſo when you come to know that men muſt needs have a Commodity of you, then to raiſe the price ſo as they cannot live upon it, this is even to drink their very blood, this is Oppreſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They love to oppreſs:</hi> (that is) The poor of their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. <note place="margin">Expoſ.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are many poor men that are ſervants to you that are Merchants, and Trades-men, they live upon their <note place="margin">1.</note> labor, and they muſt come and fetch Commodities of <note place="margin">Oppreſſion of under-trades-men.</note> you, that they muſt live by; now you knowing their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that they muſt have your work, therfore you beat down their wages, and not give unto them according as they may maintain their families: you will ſay, I do not wrong them, If he doth not, another will, I but that will not ſerve the turn.</p>
                  <p>Or otherwiſe, <hi>They love to oppreſs:</hi> Trades-men oppreſs <note place="margin">2.</note> their debtors, when they have gotten poor men into their debts then they will make them that they ſhall buy <note place="margin">Debtors</note> of them, and of none other, and ſo will put off any of their braided ware to them, and put it off at a deer rate. You will ſay, We ſell it them, yea, but you force them to buy of you; for if they ſhould go from you, then you fall upon them, and put them into priſon, or evil intreat
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:43340:168"/>
them ſome other way. This is to love to oppreſs, to take the advantages of mens neceſſities when they are grown poor. Certainly theſe things are grievous to the Spirit of God, and are abominable in the eyes of God, theſe are rebuked here, and that you may ſee that there is a great deal of evil in theſe <hi>Ballances of deceit,</hi> and <hi>oppreſſion in trading,</hi> do but conſider theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Obſerve how this is brought in, in my text, as <note place="margin">1. The evil of deceipt in trading.</note> oppoſite to turning to God; <hi>Turn to God,</hi> then preſently, <hi>He is a Merchant, the ballances of deceipt are in his hand; he loveth to oppreſs.</hi> Thoſe men that live in any way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt or oppreſſion to get gain to themſelves by thoſe waies, theſe are men that yet have not turned to God; thou haſt not turned to Jehovah, thy heart is not tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him, thy heart is turned to the earth, the earth is thy portion, thou art to look for the things of the earth to be thy portion, it is not God that thou haſt choſen, nor turned unto him.</p>
                  <p>Then Secondly, Thou doeſt certainly not know what <note place="margin">2.</note> ſin doth mean, that dareſt venture the leaſt ſin for the greateſt gain; had God ever enlightened and awakened thy conſcience to ſee what ſin doth mean, thou wouldeſt rather loſe all thy eſtate, and be cloathed with rags all thy daies, than willingly to commit the leaſt ſin, to get the greateſt eſtate. It was a ſpeech of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> That there muſt not be ſo much as an <hi>officious lye,</hi> that is, a lye when a man intends no hurt, but good, yet this muſt not be told, ſaith he, no not for the ſaving of the ſouls of all the world: ſurely then a lye muſt not be told to get twelve pence in a bargain, or five ſhillings, or fifty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, or five pounds, it muſt not be told to ſave the ſouls of all the world; Now to tell a lye to deceive others as well as thy ſelf, ſurely, God hath not yet laid the weight of ſin upon your ſouls, the day is yet to come that you ſhall know (perhaps to all eternity) what the weight and burdon of ſin means.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="316" facs="tcp:43340:169"/>
And then in the Third place. Certainly you do not <note place="margin">3</note> truſt in God, you may ſpeak of truſting in God, but it is apparant by this, That you have jealous thoughts of God, that you do not beleeve that God takes care of you; and here's not only ſin, but it ſhews your miſery, you are in ſuch a condition, that your own conſciences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn you, and tell you that God takes no care of you, for did you beleeve that God had care of you, care over my bodie, my eſtate, my ſoul, then I'le leave it to God, I'le caſt my care upon God, I'le go on in Gods way, and leave all other things to God. But now, when a man is low in the world and would fain riſe higher, or would provide ſuch a portion for his children, and he falls to deceiving, and ſo thinks to get it that way, this is the plain explicit Engliſh of it; <q>For my part I dare not truſt God to take care for me, and that that I think God to do for me is not enough, if I truſt to Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, I may be a poor man, my children may be poor, and I dare not truſt to promiſes, nor protections, nor providences, but I muſt take my own way;</q> (the truth is, the language is as much as thus much) <q>I cannot get an eſtate by God, and therefore I'le ſee what I can do by the Devil.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then Fourthly, <hi>All duties of Religion that thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeſt</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>are rejected by God;</hi> you who are conſcientious to your ſelves of waies of falſeneſs in your trading, and it may be have gone on many daies and yeers in your waies, I ſay, all the duties of Religion that you perform are rejected by God, you will deceive, and yet come to hear, and deceive again, and yet hear, and ſo make the duties of Religion to be a colour to your deceipt. Who would ſuſpect ſuch a man that is ſo forward in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that he ſhould be ſo deceiptful? Oh! curſed is that wickedneſs above all wickedneſs, it is aggravated by this, When thou makeſt Religion to be a colour of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, know, that God caſts all thy profeſſion and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:43340:169"/>
as filth and dung back again in your face. I'le give you this on Scripture in <hi>Ezek. 28. 18. Thou haſt</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>defiled thy Sanctuaries</hi> (how?) <hi>by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy TRAFFICK:</hi> By the iniquity of thy <hi>Traffick</hi> thou haſt defiled thy Sanctuaries. You go abroad and there you traffick, and deceive, and put off falſe Commodities, and have falſe Reckonings, and the like: now you come into the Sanctuary, Oh but you defile the Sanctuary by the greatneſs of your iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and among other greatneſs of your iniquities, the iniquity of your Traffick is that that defiles the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God unto you: In <hi>Micah,</hi> 6. 8. when thoſe Hypocrits had ſaid, What ſhall we do? ſhall we come with ten thouſand Rams, and Rivers of Oyl? Saith the Prophet, <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good; And what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtice, &amp;c.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Though you come with all theſe things, it's all to no purpoſe, whatſoever Offerings you offer to God, it's all nothing, except you do Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>There is a curſe mingled with every thing thou</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>doeſt enjoy.</hi> Though it may be ſome things are gotten honeſtly, yet (I ſay) there is a curſe mingled in all things thou doeſt, it doth venem and poyſon every thing thou doeſt. In <hi>Zach.</hi> 5. 3. there was a flying Rol of twenty Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and the breadth of it ten Cubics: then ſaid he unto me, This is the curſe that goeth over the whol earth, (for whom?) <hi>For every one that ſtealeth ſhall be cut off &amp;c.</hi> Everie bit of meat thou eateſt at thy Table thou maieſt look upon it as dipt in the curſe of God, I have gotten this by deceipt, thou wouldeſt be loth to have everie bit of meat rouled up in dirt and ſo put into thy mouth, but everie bit of meat is rouled up in the Curſe of God.</p>
                  <p>And then Sixthlie, ſurelie thou that art guiltie of <note place="margin">6.</note> this deceipt in the way of trading thou canſt not pray, if thou comeſt to prayer, ſurelie thy conſcience is verie
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:43340:170"/>
blind, for when thou art conſcious to thy ſelf of deceipt, how canſt thou come into the preſence of a righteous God? Canſt thou ſay, Oh Righteous Father? dareſt thou come into the preſence of ſuch a HOLY and RIGHTEOUS God that profeſs, to abominate thy waies, ſurely thy conſcience muſt be very blind, if thou doeſt not underſtand the evil of thy ſin; It may be there was a time at firſt of thy trading that thy conſcience did trouble thee for a little time, thou had'ſt miſ-giving thoughts, but thou haſt worn them out, and ſo art ready to bleſs thy ſelf that thou haſt gotten over ſuch a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty as that is: thy condition is far worſe. Or if not, If thy conſcience be not ſear'd with a hot Iron, then thou wilt be terrified. I verily think that thoſe that have any light left in them that they dare not go to prayers; Oh! doeſt thou ſo prize a little gain, as to take away the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of thy ſpirit, and the holy boldneſs of thy heart in prayer! Oh how ſhouldeſt thou ſay to Gain, <hi>Get thee hence as a menſtruous cloath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Know, that if thou ſhouldeſt come to make <note place="margin">7.</note> uſe of thy eſtate in any good work, God rejects it: <hi>Iſa. 61. 8. For I the Lord love Judgment. I hate robbery for burnt offerings;</hi> What will you come and get by deceipt an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and come and offer it to me, I abhor it ſaith God. 'Tis a ſpeech of <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> Why doeſt thou deſpiſe, and <note place="margin">Chryſoſtom.</note> deſpight God in this, in bringing unclean things to him? it's a reproach to God: a man that hath gotten an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate by deceipt, if he brings his eſtate to any Service of God, he doth reproach God.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, know that God will avenge ſuch things, it may be the poor man that thou oppreſſeſt in thy trading <note place="margin">8.</note> he cannot right himſelf upon thee, becauſe a bargain is a bargain (you will ſay) yea, but God will come over with the bargain again; it may be you have done with him in your bargain, but God hath not done with you.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay to him, You ſaw what it was, and you
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:43340:170"/>
bought the thing of me as it was, and I have nothing to <note place="margin">The excuſes of deceiptful dealers.</note> ſay to you; but God hath much to ſay to you in this, mark thoſe two Scriptures, <hi>Micah,</hi> 6. 11. the Lord ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſhewn what he did require, that men ſhould be juſt in their waies, now ſaith the text in ver. 11. <hi>Shall I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them pure with the wicked ballances, and with the bag of deceiptful weights? for the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have ſpoken lyes, and their tongue is deceip ful in their mouth; therefore alſo will I make thee ſick in ſmiting thee.</hi> Oh! when God comes to ſmite thee, he will make thee ſick to purpoſe: ſickneſs to ſuch men as have defiled conſciences in their trading is dreadful ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs indeed, as if God ſhould ſay, You ſhal have not <note place="margin">
                        <hi>De mali quaeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis non-gaudet tertius Haeres:</hi>—Of goods ill got, the thud Heir joyeth not.</note> great content in what you have, I will be avenged on you for what you do, either you, or your heirs ſhall no enjoy it. But that place concerns Chriſtians very much, a place that it's impoſſible for you that are exerciſed in Scripture, but you muſt needs take notice of it, 1 <hi>Theſ. 4. 6. That no man go beyond, and defraud his brother.</hi> In a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny matter, you muſt not go beyond your brother; your brother is weak, you will ſay, Let the weaker look to it as well as he can: No, you muſt not take advantage of his weakneſs, he is your brother, you muſt not defraud him, no not in any matter, why? becauſe that the Lord is the avenger of all ſuch, as we alſo have forewarned you and teſtified.</p>
                  <p>And know this day, the Lord forewarns you once <note place="margin">A vehement applic. of the text.</note> more by the Miniſtry of his Word, and the Lord by his Word doth teſtifie againſt you in this one thing, and if you go on in anie way of deceipt, you go on againſt the verie ſtrength of the Word, and ſtrength of Conſcience this day, and this Word that is preached this day to you ſhall certainlie teſtifie againſt you another day.</p>
                  <p>Yea further, When you come to die, Oh! how terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">9.</note> will death be to ſuch men! when they ſhall leave the ſweet of all their eſtates, and carrie nothing but the guilt,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:43340:171"/>
of all with them: In <hi>Job, 27. 8. What hope ſhall an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite have, though be hath gained, when God takes away his ſoul?</hi> Sometimes men they ſeek to deceive, and they are diſcovered, and ſo they are rendered baſe and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible to all the world; yea, but ſometimes again, they may carrie it ſo cunninglie, as they ſhall never be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, perhaps in this world, but they ſhall gain, as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> ſaith here, I am become rich and have gotten ſubſtance, but what hope hath this hypocrite though he hath gained? what profit ſhal it be though thou haſt gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the whol world and ſhalt loſe thy own ſoul? See alſo <hi>James, 5. 3. The ruſt (of your Gold and Silver) ſhall eat your fleſh as it were fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, Know further, That thou muſt reſtore, if thou <note place="margin">10.</note> haſt any eſtate now, or if thou ever comeſt to have any eſtate, it muſt be reſtor'd or thou canſt not expect to find mercy from God with all the ſorrow, cries, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers that can be, without reſtitution, there cannot be expectation of pardon and forgiveneſs. The ancient <note place="margin">Reſtitution.</note> ſpeech that all Divines in all Ages of the Church have cloſed withal was, There muſt be <hi>Reſtitution</hi> of that that is falſlie gotten, if it be in thy power to do it, thou muſt reſtore it or elſe thou canſt not have anie hope of mercie, thoſe ſweet morſels that you have ſwallowed, muſt be vomited up again; And therefore you that are Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices take heed of pleaſing your Maſters, to be deceiptful, for if you have a hand in it you muſt reſtore. I'le give you Scripture and Reaſon for it. <note place="margin">Why we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don without Reſtitution.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reaſon is this, That 'tis impoſſible that any kind of repentance can be accepted of God without reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the reaſon is; becauſe, That if I have power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore, all the while I do not reſtore I do continue in the <note place="margin">1 Reaſon.</note> ſin, I do not only wrong the man juſt the verie hour I have deceived him, but all the while I keep that which is his in my hand, this is the argument that repentance can never be accepted of God that may ſtand or doth
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:43340:171"/>
ſtand with a wilful continuance in the ſin that a man ſeems to repent of, Do I repent of my ſin, and yet wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully continue in the ſin? I ſay, <hi>Wilful,</hi> for I have it in my hand to reſtore: Oh but I ſhall undo my ſelf; I but that's wilful ſtill, Is it better for thee to keep an eſtate, or to keep a ſin? Now certainly any man that hath anie light muſt needs acknowledg thus much, That if I truly repent me of my ſin, I muſt do what poſſibly I can to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do my ſin; Can I ſay, I am heartilie ſorrie for a ſin, when I do not what I can for to undo that ſin again if I can?</p>
                  <p>And for the Scriptures for Reſtitution, there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <note place="margin">2. Scripture.</note> I'le give you two or three, <hi>Ezek. 33. 14, 15. And when I ſay unto the wicked, Thou ſhalt ſurely die: If he turn from his ſin, and do that which is lawful and right, if the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked reſtore the pledg, give again that he hath robbed, &amp;c. he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die.</hi> He doth not walk in the Statutes of life except he <hi>give again that which he hath rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. 6, 7. there you have the Law about reſtitution, when a man or woman ſhall commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſin that men commit, to do a treſpaſs againſt the Lord, and that perſon be guilty, then they ſhall confeſs their ſin which they have done, (is this al?) and he ſhall <hi>recompence his treſpaſs with the princial thereof, and ad unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him againſt whom he hath treſpaſſed.</hi> He muſt confeſs his ſin, yea, but that's not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, <note place="margin">Numb. 5. 6, 7. an excellent Scripture for Reſtitution.</note> but he muſt recompence the partie. This is a moſt excellent Scripture; Mark, it's ſaid here, <hi>If a man ſhall treſpaſs againſt the Lord,</hi> it's not only againſt <hi>Man,</hi> but againſt the <hi>Lord,</hi> againſt the rule of Juſtice that the <note place="margin">Illuſtrated. 1.</note> Lord hath ſo ſet for the maintaining of order and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Societie in the world: And then obſerve it further, if a man or woman commit a ſin, that men commit, and do a treſpaſs: you wil ſay, I do no other than all trades-men do, mark, ſaith the text, <hi>If a man or woman commit</hi>

confeſs it is a ſin that is ordinarie, but though it be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarilie committed by men, though there ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of that ſin, yet if there be not <hi>reſtitution,</hi> it will do you little good. I remember <hi>Latimer</hi> in one of his Sermons that he preach'd before King <hi>Edward,</hi> ſpeaking <note place="margin">Mr. Latimer</note> of this verie point of Reſtitution, he ſaith that the firſt day that he preached about it there comes one and gives him twenty pounds to reſtore; the next time he preached there comes in another and brings thirtie pounds, and another time he preached and there comes another and gives him two hundred pounds, ten ſhillings, and he hath this homelie expreſſion, <hi>Reſtore what you have gotten, elſe you will cough in Hell, and the Devils will laugh at you;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">His expreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of non-reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</note> Certainly it is that, that will lie heavie upon conſcience; Gravel in the kidnies will not grate ſo upon you as a little guiltineſs that is upon your conſciences. I my ſelf knew one man that had wronged another but of five ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and it ſeems he did not much regard it being but five ſhillings, yet God awakening his conſcience fiftie yeers after he comes and could not be quiet till he had reſtor'd that five ſhillings. And therefore know, that though it be manie yeers ſince you have gotten any thing by deceipt and wrong, yet God will (if he hath a love to you) put you to reſtore it again. Oh! what fooliſh luſts are the luſts of covetouſneſs, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Thoſe that will be rich they fall into many fooliſh luſts;</hi> this ſin of covetouſneſs, and deceiptfulneſs it doth bring men into fooliſh luſts, and makes men pierce themſelves with manie ſorrows; and Oh! that God would pierce them with ſome ſorrow this day, that they might <hi>never have one nights reſt quiet,</hi> till at leaſt they do reſolve in their hearts that they will ſet upon a way to make Reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>And even thoſe of you that have made falſe agreements with your creditors, if God awakens your conſciences, I ſee not how you can ſatisfie your conſcience till you ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:43340:172"/>
them, theſe things will not be peace another day.</p>
                  <p>Now the Lord convince thoſe that hearing the Word of God are guilty, and know that God will call for an account of this thing, and of this text that through providence you have come to hear of this day.</p>

but hath there been no guilt at all that thou haſt contracted by that eſtate which thou haſt got, Thou canſt not ſay but ſome guiltineſs hath been contracted, yea, but this contents thee, there is ſo much gain comes by it, Oh! thou art a wretched man that canſt ſet the gain in the world to the leaſt guilt that thou haſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, Oh! it hath been an ill bargain, riches got by guilt, thou haſt made (I ſay) an ill bargain for thy ſelf, thou knoweſt not God, knoweſt not with whom thou haſt to deal that canſt ſet any gain by ſin for to countervail the evil of that guilt that thou haſt committed for the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of that gain of thine.</p>
                  <p>And further, Wicked men labor to ſatisfie their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences with the proſperitie they are in, and what they have got by their ſin as they ſet it againſt their guilt, ſo in the Seventh place, <hi>They perſwade themſelves that God is</hi>

                     <hi>not, (at leaſt) ſo much diſpleaſed with them as many would bear them in hand.</hi> Surely if my condition were ſo dangerous as you would perſwade me to, I ſhould not proſper ſo much in my way as I do, I ſhould not get riches ſo as I do; upon this they begin to think that God is of their mind, as in <hi>Pſal. 50. 21. Thou thoughteſt I was like unto thy ſelf:</hi> we find it by experience that when men are under affliction, when Gods hand is upon men then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to think that God doth not like of their waies; but when they go on and proſper they are readie to think that God approves of their waies, that they walk in. There's a notable ſtorie concerning the Mother of <hi>Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard, Gratian,</hi> and <hi>Comeſtor,</hi> [The firſt, the Maſter of the Sentences (as they call them.) The Second, the compiler of a great part of the Popes Law, the Decretal Epiſtles; the third, the Author of the Scholaſtical Hiſtorie, the beſt man and book of the three.] All famous men, and all <note place="margin">The Mother of <hi>Gratian &amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> three of them were <hi>Baſtards;</hi> Now the Mother of them being a Whore, when ſhe came to make her confeſſion to the Prieſt, ſhe could not acknowledg much evil in it,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:43340:175"/>
and ſhe profeſt ſhe could not find her heart griev'd or troubled much about it; (when the Prieſt urged her penance and repentance for it) becauſe though it's true, that the thing was evil that ſhe did, yet that ſhe did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper ſo wel, that they were three ſuch eminent men of ſuch great uſe as thoſe were. Thus it's ordinarilie, men think that it may leſſen the-greatneſs of their ſin if they get any thing by it, if they proſper in their ſinful way, there is no ſuch cauſe of trouble and grief for it: The people they may laugh at me (ſaith a covetous man) but <note place="margin">Populus me ſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat, at mihi plaudo ipſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi ſimul ac nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plor in Arca.</note> I applaud my ſelf at home, when I behold the money in the Cheſt, ſo long as I ſee comings-in, let men talk what they will, I cannot beleeve that things are ſo bad as they report, that God is ſo much againſt me, but I hope God loves me. Theſe are the reaſonings of a carnal heart, and all becauſe he proſpers in his ſin. I remember it's reported of <hi>Dioniſius</hi> that when he had committed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledg, and had a good voyage after it, ſaith he, See <note place="margin">Videtis quàm bona navigatio, ab ipſis dijs, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criligis tribua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Val.

Oh! theſe are Heatheniſh reaſonings, and yet I fear they are not altogether rooted out of ſuch as profeſs themſelves Chriſtians. You that have good Voiages abroad (obſerve it) it may be if you meet with an ill Voiage, then you begin to recollect your ſelf, What ſin have I been guiltie of? but now, if you have a good Voiage, though you have contracted much guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon your ſpirits while you were at Land, yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpering in your Voiage, you never think of anie danger, but all is well becauſe you have a good Voiage. Oh no, a good Voiage is no ſign that there is not guiltineſs: As ſometimes I have told you, that a painted face is no ſign of a good complexion; it may be it is the Curſe of God upon thee that doth let thee ſo to proſper, and if God had anie love unto thee he would not let thee to proſper ſo as he doth, he would croſs thee in thy waies that ſo

thou mighteſt bethink thy ſelf, There's another man perhaps that was as wicked as thou, and yet the Lord had a love to him, and he croſt him in his waies, ſo that he hath begun to bethink himſelf, and not to be at reſt till he gets the guilt of his ſin done away; but for thee, Gods heart it ſeems is not yet towards thee, he hath no love to thee; and if he lets thee go on and ſtill proſper in a ſinful way, this is from the fruit of <hi>Reprobation;</hi> and certainlie there cannot be ſcarce a greater note of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate than for a man to proſper in a ſinful way: This <note place="margin">A dangerous Note of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</note> is that we ſhould all pray to God to deliver us from, Lord, let us never proſper in a ſinful way, if thou feeſt our way be naught, that we contract guiltineſs upon our ſpirits in our way, Lord, let us not thrive and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper; if we do, a thouſand to one but we are undone for ever.

Oh! but if ſo be, that God would but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover unto the world, unto all your neighbors what he is able to charge you of, how loathſom would many of you appear to your neighbors! how unfit would you be to trade with men, or who would meddle with you! if (I ſay) God ſhould open to the world all that he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to charge you of.

it; you think now becauſe you have only to deal with God you can do well enough with him: Do you think it ſuch a matter to deal with the infinite, holy, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God!

                  <p>A Sixth Note is, <hi>A carnal heart leſſens his ſins that he</hi>

It is but a little over-reaching, a little craft and cunning, the matter is not great. Well, that which thou accounteſt little, the Lord will account great another day, the over reaching thy brother, the defrauding thy borther, though it be but a ſlight of hand, God will find it to be a great matter one day, if God were but humbling thy heart, and doing good to thy ſoul, <hi>Thou wouldeſt rather aggravate thy ſin,</hi> that's in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the way of a true Convert, he labors rather to aggravate <note place="margin">
                        <hi>A true</hi> Convert</note> his ſin, to bring all the circumſtances he can to make his ſin heavie upon his ſoul: Oh! I find I cannot get my heart to break for my ſin, I cannot apprehend the evil of my ſin as I would in the greatneſs of it, and therefore, Oh! that God would help me to ſee the greatneſs of it; he ſtudies all the circumſtances that he can to make his ſin great in his own eyes: but now a heart that is not wrought upon to a work of Repentance, all that he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors for, it is to leſſen his ſin, and to have all the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings

that he can in a way of deminution of his ſin; Oh! this is an ill ſign.</p>
                  <p>It is a very ill ſign, <hi>That a man ſtands it out as long as he</hi>

                  <p>And then the laſt Note is this, <hi>That if men can but ſcape the danger of Law, that they cannot be ſued, there's all that</hi>

Take your advantage if you can, ſay they: Now if it were not for Atheiſm in mens hearts it would be the greateſt advantage of all, that a man is able to charge his conſcience: What witneſs have you for ſuch a thing? I have your conſcience, Oh they are glad of that, if they hear that you have no other witneſs, then they think they can do well enough: Now that's an argument of Atheiſm in mens hearts, that they think they are well enough whatſoever they do, when Law cannot take hold on them. Well, there is a Court of Conſcience to ſue thee in, and Juſtice will ſue thee in that Court, and caſt thee one day, though mans Law cannot. It follows;</p>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>When men proſper in a ſinful way they forget what God hath done for them in former times.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, <note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> You do not remember that I am the Lord thy God from the Land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> Now you are frolick and merrie, and have your hearts deſires; but remember there was a time when you were low enough, and cried and made your moan to me in your affliction, Oh! remember thoſe daies.

                  <p>Is it ſo, that it is not for any ſins that have been paſt that I am like to periſh, but if I periſh, I ſhall periſh for continuing rather in evil, than for what evil I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, Oh! the Lord forbid then that I ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, let me this day make a ſtop in evil.

                  <p>WHat <hi>Gilead</hi> was you have formerly heard in the ſixth Chapter, and eight Verſe. <hi>Gilead</hi> is a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">Gilead.</note> of them that work iniquitie; it was a City of the Prieſts, beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> where the Prieſts that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the River liv'd.

                  <p>I may ſpare a great deal of time in ſpeaking to the Places, having before ſpoken to them:</p>
                  <p>Therefore now to ſee what the ſcope of the holy Ghoſt is here, <hi>Is there iniqnity in</hi> Gilead?</p>

Is there iniquity in <hi>Gilead?</hi> is there iniquity among them? do they not joyn in this way? This ſeems plainly to be even the ſcope of this Charge, <hi>Is there iniquity in</hi> Gilead? a wonder that there ſhould be iniquity; what, 'tis the City of the Prieſt? is there iniquity there? what in ſuch a place where they uſe to meet, where they dwel!

                  <p>
                     <hi>Surely they are vanity;</hi> Though they be your Prieſts, though they be learned men, and ſhould underſtand the way of God, yet they have their own intereſts too, they drive their own deſigns, they keep not the Truth of God, but they follow their own minds, <hi>Surely they are vanity;</hi> thoſe waies that they perſwade you to, God allows not of, they will prove vanity, even wiſe, learned, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <note place="margin">Let the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned note.</note> men, the Prieſts who ſeem'd to be much for God, may yet be vanity.</p>

                  <p>Again, This <hi>Gilead</hi> being on the other ſide of <hi>Jordan,</hi> it was taken by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and thoſe in <hi>Gilead</hi> were carried captive before the other Cities, they were carried <note place="margin">Expoſ. 2.</note>

What then can <hi>Gilgal</hi> expect? they yet ſacrifice Bullocks, they are guilty of the ſame ſin of falſe worſhip as <hi>Gilead</hi> was; God had appointed but one place to worſhip in, but they had abundance of ſacrifices, and had their Altars as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as the very heaps of ſtones that was in the fields.</p>
                  <p>From whence you may Note,</p>

                  <p>But further, The Principal Note is this, <hi>Gilead</hi> had <note place="margin">Expoſ.</note> ſmarted thus and thus, yet <hi>Gilgal,</hi> that belonged to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> and the Prophet now ſpeaks to them, look to your ſelves, If <hi>Gilead</hi> hath ſmarted thus, you are like to ſmart as much and much more; for <hi>Gilead</hi> they did not own the Temple; the ten Tribes (you know) had forſaken the Temple; and were in a more remote way from God in their very profeſſion; but <hi>Gilgal</hi> did belong to <hi>Judah,</hi> and
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:43340:188"/>
ſo were in a neerer way to God in their Profeſſion, they profeſt a greater care of Gods Worſhip; now ſaith he, What, ſhall not <hi>Gilead</hi> eſcape, who was in a remoter way of profeſſion, and yet ſhall God be thus avenged of <hi>Gilead</hi> for falſe worſhip? how ſhall <hi>Gilgal</hi> eſcape that profeſſes a greater neerneſs to God in his Worſhip, and yet for all that corrupt Gods Worſhip, and ſacrifices Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks upon the Altars, as heaps of ſtones in the furrows of the field? that's then our Note from hence,</p>

                  <p>We may look at this point as neerly concerning our <note place="margin">Applic. to Reformers in England.</note> ſelves thus, if a Superſtitious, Prelatical Miniſtry, and People had the wrath of God purſuing them, as it hath been heavy upon them, then thoſe who ſhall profeſs to come neer in the point of Reformation, whoſoever they be, this ſide or the other ſide, any way, whoſoever profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to come neerer, if they mingle their own inventions in Worſhip, God will be more ſorely diſpleaſed with them, the more piety and holineſs, the more we profeſs to come cloſe to the Word of God, and yet withal mingle our own inventions, the more is God diſpleaſed; <hi>Gilgal</hi> is rather more than <hi>Gilead.</hi>

                  <p>Or it may have reference to ſome Superſtitious or Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous way of theirs; In the furrows of the field they <note place="margin">Expoſ. 2.</note> had many Altars built to ſacrifice, that they might ſeek God for the fructifying of their field; ſuch a kind of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping

of God as afterwards the Heathens had, that is in the bounds of their fields, they there performed ſome ſuperſtitious right and ceremony unto their gods for the <note place="margin">Dij terminalis</note> bleſſing of their fields; and following their example, the Papiſts and thoſe that are ſuperſtitious: and hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>England</hi> you know it was ordinary when men <note place="margin">Proceſſion-Weeks in England.</note> went up and down their <hi>Perambulation</hi> in the bounds of their field they would ſet up Croſſes, and Crucifixes, and would have Prayers read, and Pſalms ſung there, which was not meerly to ſhew what was the bounds of their Pariſh, but to invocate God for his bleſſing upon their fruits; and by making and ſetting up Croſſes in the bounds of their fields, they thought there came a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon their Corn that way, and therefore in that time of the yeer rather, they would go to their Croſſes and have their Prayers there that they might have their Corn and Paſtors more bleſſed: thus we ſee old waies in Superſtition and Idolatry even ſince that time, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles is kept, and the ſame kind among the Papiſts, and lately was among our ſelves, they had their Altars in the furrows of the field.</p>

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:43340:189"/>
changing his wages often, and carrying himſelf very proudly and haughtely towards him; ſaith he, Do not forget the meanneſs of <hi>Jacob,</hi> he fled thus: And there he would have a Wife, and when he had a Wife, <hi>He had no dowry, but be was fain to ſerve, for his condition was ſo low and mean.</hi> That's the firſt end why the Prophet brings in <hi>Jacob</hi> here again, to take them off from too high a conceit of <hi>Jacob</hi> their Father, that they ſhould not reſt themſelves in him, nor pride themſelves in his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is for this end, That he might ſhew what <note place="margin">Scope. 2.</note> their Father <hi>Jacob</hi> was, how unlike to him they who were of his poſterity were, for he was patient and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble under long and hard afflictions, as if he ſhould ſay, He was content to ſerve, and be in a low and mean conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but you are proud and haughty, you can bear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but be high and brave, and muſt ſute your ſelves with other Nations; your Father JACOB was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſerve a long time for a Wife, ſeven years, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven yeers again, and went on in a humble and patient way, and kept cloſe to God all that while, it's not ſo with you who are his poſterity.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He brings in the example of <hi>Jacob,</hi> to ſhew <note place="margin">Scope, 3.</note> how wonderful the providence of God was towards him, in carrying him to his Uncles houſe, and providing there for him, in protecting of him againſt his Uncle <hi>Laban,</hi> is raiſing of his eſtate, for he went over with his ſtaff in his hand, but the Lord raiſed him to be two Bands; The providence of God was that towards your father <hi>Jacob,</hi> as if the Prophet ſhould ſay, You ſpeak of your Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> Oh that you would but conſider of him, to be as he was, to be patient, and humble under Gods hand, and wait upon Gods providence to work good for you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no, but you will be providing and ſhifting for your ſelves, and you dare not truſt to God as your father <hi>Jacob</hi> did, and thus you ſee the ſcope why the Prophet brings in <hi>Jacob.</hi>

But this will not ſuffice for the opening of this notable <note place="margin">A further Expoſit. of the Text.</note> Scripture, we muſt have ſome reference to the ſtory this Scripture is taken out of.

For this verſe hath two ſtories in it, the ſtory of his flying into <hi>Syria,</hi> from the houſe of his father <hi>Iſaac</hi> to <hi>Labans</hi> houſe; and then the ſtory of his ſerving for his Wives, thoſe two ſeven yeers.</p>
                  <p>Now for the Firſt, you ſhall find matter of much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>The Firſt ſtory of his flying into <hi>Syria,</hi> it was for two ends; That was the Firſt to fly for his life, becauſe <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note> did threaten the life of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and by the counſel of his Mother he fled to his Uncle <hi>Labans,</hi> until the wrath of <hi>Eſau</hi> ſhould be appeaſed.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but there was a Second Reaſon. God made advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage <note place="margin">2.</note> of that flight of his. As many times God is pleaſed to turn the flights of his people to abundance of good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, they may fly becauſe of the danger of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and they may think that if they can but have their lives for a prey, if they can avoid the danger of the Enemy it will do well; yea, but God may have a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end and intend abundance of good to them, that they ſhall find more mercy in that place where they fly <note place="margin">Note.</note> but to get a ſhelter for their lives, than ever they had in all their lives before; many that have fled from perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ungodly men, they have found greater mercy in the place they have fled unto, though they have fled from their Fathers houſe, and from their own Country, yet they have found greater mercies there than ever they did in all their lives, they can tell great ſtories of the mercies of God unto them in the places of their flight. So it was here with <hi>Jacob;</hi> that was one end of God that he ſhould fly, that he might provide a Wife for himſelf out of his Mothers kindred, for ſo he was charged, you ſhall find
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:43340:190"/>
in the ſtory of <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. that he was charged there by his Father to get a Wife of the Daughters of <hi>Laban.</hi> And now obſerve it in <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 3. ver. when as <hi>Jacob</hi> did thus fly into <hi>Syria,</hi> becauſe <hi>Iſaac</hi> did ſee that he was like to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure <note place="margin">How <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſent <hi>Iacob</hi> away. 1</note> a great deal of trouble and affliction in this his flight, <hi>Iſaac</hi> doth renue the bleſſing upon him. And thus God doth uſe to do when he ſees his people to be in ſuch a way wherein they are like to ſuffer ſore and hard afflictions, the Lord prepares them by renewing his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon them, by a freſh manifeſtation of himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and the renewing of Gods bleſſing is enough to <note place="margin">Note.</note> carry a man or woman through abundance of afflictions, for that did help much to carry <hi>Jacob</hi> through all his afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Further, Obſerve in the Second place, when <hi>Iſaac</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> ſent <hi>Jacob</hi> away, he ſent him away in a very mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, without any ſuch proviſion as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant was ſent with when he went to ſeek a Wife for <hi>Iſaac,</hi> we reade in <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 10. where <hi>Abraham</hi> ſent his ſervant to find out a Wife for his ſon <hi>Iſaac, Abraham</hi> ſent him with a great deal of proviſion, with ten Camels, and with Earings, and Bracelets, and the like; but <hi>Jacob</hi> is ſent away to ſeek for a Wife, and ſent with a ſtaff in his hand.</p>
                  <p>If it be ſaid, That this is the reaſon why he was <note place="margin">Why ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſo mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> ſent ſo meanly, that it was for privacie, becauſe he would not be diſcovered in regard of the rage of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though that might be a reaſon of his firſt going away <note place="margin">1.</note> in ſo mean a condition, yet that could not be the reaſon why <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhould not ſend after him afterwards, for we never reade that <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſent any ſervant after him, but ſent him away with his ſtaff in his hand, having only the bleſſing of God upon him; Therefore it is more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble this, That God did mean to train up <hi>Jacob</hi> in a low <note place="margin">2. The chief reaſon.</note> condition, in an eſtate of affliction, to train him up to
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:43340:191"/>
patience, and humility, and in dependance upon God.</p>
                  <p>Well then, he goes to <hi>Laban,</hi> he flies to <hi>Syria:</hi> that is, to his Uncle <hi>Laban,</hi> when he comes there he ſerves him, yea, he was a Servant to him for twenty yeers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a low condition, ſo you find it in <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 38. he ſaith there, <hi>He had ſerved him twenty yeers,</hi> and in all this time he found <hi>Laban,</hi> though his kinſman, very rough to him; as many times yong people coming to their kindered find them very rough and hard towards them. <hi>Laban</hi> was very churliſh towards him: and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Kindred.</note> falſe to him, yet <hi>Jacob</hi> goes on and endures all the heat of the day, and the cold of the night, and <hi>Iſaac</hi> his Father was alive all this while, and yet we never reade that <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſent to him all this time, a thing much to be wondered at, there was never any intercourſe that I read of between his Father <hi>Iſaac</hi> and him all this while, but lives from his Father, though his Father, a rich man and a great man, and yet he goes on in a humble, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and quiet way, depending upon God to make an iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue out of all his ſufferings, and God did at length make a very glorious iſſue out of all, though <hi>Laban</hi> uſed him hardly. Now being <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s ſon and he had the bleſſing, one would have thought that <hi>Laban</hi> ſhould have been willing to have beſtowed a daughter upon him, nay but he ſerves for a Wife, and when he had ſerved him, yet he was deceived with a <hi>Leah,</hi> which was a very great injury to <hi>Jacob, Laban</hi> urged her upon him; and it's a very great part of roughneſs, and ridgedneſs, and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Guardians, or Parents, or any that have the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Parents or Guardians may not force Wives or Husbands upon Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> of others, to force Wives upon them for their own private advantage, to force Wives upon their Children or Kindred, thoſe matches ſeldom come to good; though God turned this to good, yet I ſay they do ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom come to good, theſe forced matches, it's that which is the undoing of many men and women, yong women

to be ſo uſed: but <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw no remedy, <hi>Fulfill her week,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 29. 27. Expounded</note> that is, the week of the Feſtivity of her Marriage, that is, confirm this match firſt; he would have had that Wife that he had ſerved for, nay ſaith <hi>Laban,</hi> confirm this <note place="margin">Note.

                  <p>Now the Lord was pleaſed to turn this to a great deal of good, though it was hard ſervice and bondage, yet theſe two Wives that <hi>Jacob</hi> ſerved ſo long for, they were
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:43340:192"/>
made the two greateſt inſtruments of good that ever had been in the Church before, or ever ſince, but only the Virgin that brought forth Chriſt; for by theſe two was the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> built up, Twelve Tribes came of them, and thoſe that they gave unto <hi>Jacob;</hi> but the holy Ghoſt reckons the building up by theſe two, and the bleſſing that was wont to be upon a married condition, it was taken from theſe two, in a kind of proverbial way; in <hi>Ruth,</hi> 4. 11. the Elders ſaid to <hi>Boaz, The Lord make the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that is come into thine houſe, like</hi> Rachel, <hi>and like</hi> Leah, <hi>which two did build the houſe of</hi> Iſrael: ſo that this was the common bleſſing in a married condition, the Lord make this woman like <hi>Rachel,</hi> and like <hi>Leah</hi> that built the houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is from hence, Becauſe they built up the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and all that came from them were of the Church, Oh it is a great bleſſing in a married condition to build <note place="margin">What is the bleſſing in a married con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</note> up the houſe of God, that's the bleſſing in a married con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; though thou ſhouldeſt ſerve hardly for a Wife, yet if God makes thy marriage ſo bleſſed to thee, as thou comeſt to build up the Church of God by thy marriage, that's a bleſſed marriage; and thoſe that are married, in their prayers, ſhould pray to God for ſuch a bleſſing, and their friends ſhould pray to God for ſuch a bleſſing, Oh <note place="margin">Which they ſhould pray for.</note> that the Lord would make this woman, and my Wife, ſo to be a builder up of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

And any of you that are here preſent, if you be guilty this way, know that the Lord rebukes you this day, and you are taught to go alone, and humble your ſelves, and to bewail that ſin of yours, which is certainly a very great ſin, and you had need both Huſband and Wife together, both faſt and pray to get away the guilt of that ſin, that ſo you may have a bleſſing upon your married eſtate, and upon your poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, without which you cannot expect it; therefore did <hi>Jacob</hi> ſerve thus that he might be obedient to his Father <hi>Iſaac,</hi> which did charge him to go and take a Wife in

                  <p>This that I bring this for, it is, To ſhew the great work of God, that by a Prophet he brings ſuch a number out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and he preſerves them in the Wilderneſs, uſes no means for their preſervation, for the guiding of them which way they ſhould go, but a mean Prophet; for the providing water for them, for the providing meat for them, for the providing of cloathes for them, for the defending of them againſt their Enemies, that they ſhould not come and deſtroy them; when they were in any danger, to help them; when they were ſtung by the Serpents, to ſhew them what they ſhould do to heal them, and to keep them all in peace that they ſhould not mutiny one againſt another; To compoſe all their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, this Prophet had the great ſtroke in all theſe things, this was the mighty work of God towards them.</p>
                  <p>He doth not ſay, he brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but <hi>by a Prophet he brought them out of</hi> Egypt, and by a <hi>Prophet</hi>

                  <p>This was firſt to ſhew their very low and mean condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">1.</note> that they had no ſuccor nor help in the ſight of humane reaſon, humane reaſon could no way help them, they had none but a poor Prophet.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It was to ſhew this, That God in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance <note place="margin">2.</note> would appear himſelf, and would work ſuch a glorious work by his own hand.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It was to upbraid this people that <hi>Hoſea</hi> did <note place="margin">3.</note> preach unto at this time, for the abuſe of his Prophets,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:43340:195"/>
there was a time (ſaith he) a Prophet ſtood you in ſtead, now you care not for the Prophets, they may ſpeak what they will, but you care not for them; but there was a time that a Prophet ſtood you in ſtead, how ever ſtout and proud you are now. I find divers Interpreters ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this, and among the Ancients eſpecially <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria</hi> hath it, ſhewing how Inſtrumental a Prophet had been after good unto them. Had not God bleſſed the <note place="margin">Cyril.</note> endeavors of a Prophet for good unto your forefathers, where had you been at this day?</p>
                  <p>Firſt note, <hi>That the conſideration of the ſhiftleſs eſtate of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>our Anceſtors ſhould humble us much:</hi> And if the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Anceſtors ſhould humble us thus, how much more when we conſider of our own ſhiftleſs eſtate. Oh! lately, how ſhiftleſs were we! And the truth is, though <note place="margin">Applied to England.</note> there were Armies raiſed, yet God would not ſo much look at them, but rather look'd at his Prophets, and his Servants; the praying people were the main and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal means that did help us in that condition, and this ſhould humble us, we ſhould take heed of gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing haughty and proud when we are delivered, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how ſhiftleſs we were but a little while ago; and therefore if now we have gotten peace, and proſperity we think is coming in, take heed of pride now, look back to that ſhiftleſs, poor condition that you were in a little while ago.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God ſhews here mercy to his people by a Prophet, that notes this, <hi>That when God works great things</hi>

Gods deliverance of his people from <hi>Egypt</hi> it was a type of the deliverance of his Churches to the end of the world from their bondage and afflictions, and God ſends them a Prophet, and he muſt deliver them. Though God did it, yet God puts it upon the Prophet as the great Inſtrumental means for their help, God takes

delight in this, when he doth good to his people, not to make uſe of ſuch great means, as when he doth work his own ends other waies towards other people; when <note place="margin">Difference of God's wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for his People, and for others.</note> God intends good towards other people he will do it in a more natural way, by natural means; but when he comes to work good for his own, he will do it in a more ſupernatural way: For mercies are ſo much the ſweeter by how much the more God is in them; ſo much the <note place="margin">Reaſ. 1.</note> more as we ſee the finger of God in a mercy, ſo much the ſweeter it is. And above all things the Lord accounts <note place="margin">2.</note> himſelf glorified in his peoples depending upon him in the want of all means, the Lord accounts this his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that he may be an object of the reſt of the ſouls of his people, that when they are in any ſtraights, in any affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that yet they can look upon God as an object for their reſt, and can ſay, <hi>My ſoul, return unto thy reſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh conſider of this you that are the Servants of God, <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> when you are in ſtraits and difficulties, remember this Note, That God accounts it to be the great glory that he rejoyces in, the ſpecial glory of his Name that his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhall make him in their ſtrai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is a great aggravation of mens ſins, if they</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>grow naught and wicked after God hath in a more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manner appeared for their good.</hi> If then they grow naught and wicked when God hath appeared from Heaven for their good, and wrought beyond all natural means, and ſet them upon their legs again and delivered them, it much aggravates their ſins.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, which is a principal thing that I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve <note place="margin">Obſ. 4.</note> the holy Ghoſt aim'd at in this place, and that is this, <hi>That the Unkindneſs to, and Abuſe of ſuch as have refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>

                     <hi>though but in a way of ſucceſſion unto ſuch as God hath uſed to be Inſtruments of our deliverance, is a very great evil,</hi>

(that's the Note) By a Prophet the Lord brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and by a Prophet he preſerved them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and what, do you abuſe them now, and are ſo much againſt them?</p>
                  <p>Divers good things God hath done for his People by Prophets, As by <hi>Moſes</hi> here, ſo afterwards by <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Eliah,</hi> and <hi>Eliſha;</hi> great things in the matters of State <note place="margin">Note.</note> God had done for this People by Prophets, and therfore he takes it very ill that they ſhould ſo abuſe and ſlight the Prophets as they did. <note place="margin">The aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this ſin. 1. 2.</note>

                  <p>This ſhews, for people to do thus, 1. A baſe <hi>levite</hi> of ſpirit: 2. An abominable <hi>ingratitude</hi> of ſpirit, and vile injuſtice, and God will avenge theſe things. We have a notable Scripture in <hi>Judg.</hi> 8. 34, 35. and in <hi>Judg.</hi> 9. 16. In the 8. Chapter of <hi>Judges,</hi> you reade there, how God charges the People; <hi>And it came to paſs aſſoon as</hi> Gideon <hi>was dead, that the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baalberith their god; and the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>remembred not the Lord their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of their enemies on every ſide: neither ſhewed they kindneſs to the houſe of</hi> Jerubbaal, <hi>namely</hi> Gideon, <hi>according to all the goodneſs which he had ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed unto</hi> Iſrael. <hi>Gideon</hi> had been a famous Inſtrument of good to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they received forty years proſperitie by him, but aſſoon as he was gone, the people went a whoring from God, and then they were unkind towards his poſteritie; ſo you find in Chap. 9. Verſ. 16. <hi>All the men of</hi> Shechem <hi>gathered themſelves together; and all the houſe of</hi> Millo, <hi>and went and made</hi> Abimelech <hi>King.</hi> And one of <hi>Gideon</hi>'s Sons goes and expoſtulates the matter with them, and tels them the Parable of the Trees that did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a King, but ſaith <hi>Jotham</hi> to them afterwards in the 19. Verſ. <hi>If ye have dealt truly and ſincerely with</hi> Jerubbaal, <hi>and with his houſe this day, then rejoyce in</hi> Abimelech, <hi>and let him alſo rejoyce in you: but if not, let fire come out from</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelech, <hi>and devour the men of</hi> Shechem, <hi>and the houſe of</hi>

Millo; <hi>and let fire come out from the men of</hi> Shechem, <hi>and from the houſe of</hi> Millo, <hi>and devour</hi> Abimelech. As if he ſhould have ſaid, God will avenge this: What, did God make my Father an Inſtrument of ſo great good to you, and do you ſo ill requite all his kindneſs and ſervice that he did for you? The Lord judg, and if it be ſo indeed as now I charge you, let this be a manifeſtation of Gods diſpleaſure, <hi>That fire come from</hi> Abimelech, &amp;c. As if he ſhould ſay, Do not think that you can have peace and quiet in ſuch kind of waies as you are in, you think you have provided well for your ſelves in ſetting up of <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech,</hi> and now you bleſs your ſelves; We ſhal have peace, and go on and be quiet; Oh no, the diſpleaſure of God will go on and purſue you, and there wil be a fire among your ſelves, and it's juſt with God that it ſhould be ſo, for this ingratitude of yours towards thoſe that have bin ſo inſtrumental for your good. The Scripture holds out this, that this is one way for God to avenge himſelf upon a People that ſhall be ungrateful to ſuch as have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental for good to them, that they ſhall have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe <note place="margin">A perverſe ſpirit, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ingratitude.</note> ſpirit mingled among themſelves, that when they think to provide for their own eaſe and peace, they ſhall have a fire mingled among themſelves, ſo as in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to devour themſelves. Theſe people were very zealous for <hi>Gideon</hi> in <hi>Judg.</hi> 8 22. when God had delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, they came to <hi>Gideon</hi> and ſaid unto him, <hi>Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy ſon, and thy ſon's ſon alſo:</hi> they made great promiſes, Oh how were the people affected! Come, Rule over us, thou, and thy ſon, and thy ſon's ſon, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Oh! we were in a dangerous condition, and were like to have been in a perpetual bondage under our enemies, but God hath ſtirred up thee, and bleſt thee, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou, and thy ſon, and thy ſon's ſon ſhall rule over us: they were mightily affectd with this mercy of God when it was freſh, but preſently after you ſhall find they

were off, and forgot what an Inſtrument of God <hi>Gideon</hi> had been unto them, and required the poſterity of <hi>Gideon</hi> as ill as if he had been one of their greateſt enemies.</p>

Yea, though <hi>Ephraim</hi> was the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brother, that came of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> yet by the guidance of the hand of God upon <hi>Jacob</hi>'s hand, the bleſſing came upon him more eſpecially; and ſo from time to time God put much honor upon this Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the bleſſing he had from <hi>Jacob,</hi> when his right hand did lay hold upon the head of <hi>Ephraim.

                     <note place="margin">Joſhua.</note> he was of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and when <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſpake, what trembling was there among all the people? what mighty power and authority had he? And you reade in <hi>Judges,</hi> 8. in their ſpeaking to <hi>Gideon,</hi> what trembling they cauſed, and what yeelding preſently when they ſpake, in <hi>Judges,</hi> 8. the beginning, <hi>And the men of</hi> Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im <hi>ſpake unto him, Why haſt thou ſerved us thus, that thou calledſt us not when thou wenteſt to fight with the</hi> Medianites? <hi>and they did chide with him ſharply.

Is not the glea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Grapes of</hi> Ephraim <hi>better than the vintage of</hi> Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ezer? And ſo in <hi>Judges,</hi> 12. when <hi>Ephraim</hi> came to fight with <hi>Jephthah</hi> they had thought to have done the ſame, they ſpake great and ſwelling words, <hi>Ephraim</hi> took much upon him, and made account that all ſhould trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſhake when he ſpake.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Jeroboam</hi> he was of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and ſo <note place="margin">Jeroboam.</note> it hath reference in a more eſpecial manner to him, and his houſe, when <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſpake, the Princely Power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put upon that Tribe of <hi>Ephraim</hi> in <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and they having power in their hands they did prevail very much at the firſt, and cauſed trembling to all thoſe they ſpake to. But as if the holy Ghoſt ſhould ſay, There's a great change now in <hi>Ephraim,</hi> he is not now as he was, nor is not like to continue ſo. <hi>Ephraim</hi> preſuming upon his excellency, and upon his ſtrength, and worth,

he preſum'd to ſin, he ſin'd in <hi>Baal,</hi> that is, in a way of Idolatry, for ſo <hi>Baal</hi> ſometimes is a general word for an Idol, <hi>Jer. 9. 14.

But eſpecially let us give God that honor when God ſpeaks, Oh let there be <note place="margin">We are with reverence to hear the Lord ſpeak.</note> trembling, Is this an honor that inferiors ſhould give to their Superiors to ſhew reverence when they ſpeak, Oh let us give this to God, <hi>Pſal. 103. 20.

                     <hi>account it their honor, not only that thoſe under them regard what they ſay, but that they ſhould tremble at what they ſay.</hi> It is a great delight that man hath to lift up himſelf above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to be imperious above others, we might give divers examples of men that have had great power in their hands, and when any thing hath diſpleaſed them, they would ſpeak ſo as to make others to ſhake and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Nay, not only men in great place will do it, but you ſhall find this diſpoſition in men that are very mean and of a very low rank, yet if they have any under them, they will be imperious over them; as now in Families, <note place="margin">The imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of ſome in their families.</note> how many when they do but ſpeak to their Wives, though ſhe be colateral, and not directly under him, yet how imperiouſly do they ſpeak, ſpeak ſo as to make the houſe ſhake almoſt when they ſpeak, and ſo Servants and Children: and this they account their Glory.

                  <p>Again, <hi>When he ſpake, there was trembling.</hi>

                  <p>This the Prophet mentions as a means to aggravate his <note place="margin">Expoſ.</note> ſin and miſery afterwards, As if the Prophet ſhould ſay, There was a time that God did ſubdue the hearts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under <hi>Ephraim,</hi> ſo that <hi>Ephraim</hi> had a great deal of Authority over thoſe that were under him, <hi>When</hi> Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im <hi>ſpake, there was trembling.</hi>

In <hi>Joſh. 4. 14. On that day the Lord magnified</hi> Joſhua

                     <hi>in the ſight of all</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and they feared him as they feared</hi> Moſes. <hi>Joſhua</hi> before <hi>Moſes</hi> dyed, was but a ſervant to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and we do not reade that he was ſo magnified among the People, they did not fear him ſo much; No, the fear was then upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> was in place of Authority; but when <hi>Moſes</hi> was taken away, and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> was to ſucceed him in Authority, then the Lord magnified him, the Lord put a luſtre upon him, and the Lord cauſed the People to fear him, as they had feared <hi>Moſes:</hi> It is a work of God to cauſe People to fear Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates. So in <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>For the Majeſtie be gave him,</hi> (that God gave the King) <hi>all People, and Nations, and Languages trembled and feared before him.</hi> It's God that puts majeſtie upon Governors, to make thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to fear.

                  <p>Though <hi>Ephraim</hi> the yonger, yet when he got Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in his hand, how imperious was he?

                  <p>And then a Fifth is this, (which is a principal thing to be obſerved here, a Note from the change of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> when <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſpake, trembling, but after he ſinned, he died.) <hi>That men which heretofore have</hi>

It was, that they were partial in the Law, that was a main thing, that is, they would handle the Word of God partially, what they could get to drive on their own waies by, they would improve that to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt, and turn the Word which way they pleaſed; upon this, though they thought to prevail that way, and

                     </gap> this was the thing that God threatens, to make them to be vile and contemptible in the eyes of the people becauſe of this. When people come to diſcover this, that men do indeed drive on their own deſigns, and their own ends in the waies of God, there's nothing will take away their repute and their honor more, Oh the great change that there is, in the honors and eſteem of men, God for their ſin caſts them out, and their names as vile men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who have out-liv'd their honors, even in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hearts of the Saints: Indeed when there is a change in an outward condition from proſperity to afflictions, then wicked and carnal men will not regard thoſe that they did honor before. As in <hi>Job</hi>'s caſe, in <hi>Job,</hi> 29. <hi>Job</hi> tells us how he was honored, and regarded, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced where he liv'd in proſperity, but when he was in affliction, in <hi>Job,</hi> 30. 1. <hi>Now thoſe who are yonger than I, have me in deriſion,</hi> that's a wickedneſs to change our minds of the eſteem of men, becauſe of their proſperity, or adverſity; it ſhews a great <hi>vanity of ſpirit,</hi> and where the heart is right, if one that hath been godly and in publick place heretofore, and now God by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <note place="margin">Note.</note> hath brought him down in regard of his outward eſtate, yet he is to be honored ſtill continuing in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and holineſs. But now this is that which I ſpeak of as a Judgment of God upon men, when God caſts out their names from the very hearts of the Saints, and that worthily too, when they ſhall be worthy to be look'd upon as dead carcaſſes, though heretofore much honored and reſpected, heretofore they were as Gardens that had many ſweet Flowers, excellent common gifts they had for which they, were reſpected; but now like Gardens over-grown with Weeds that no body doth regard; As Houſes that were hung with coſtly Hangings, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards pull'd down and nothing left but the bare walls: ſo their gifts were very precious, but now as thoſe Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

having their Lord and Prince gone away there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but bare walls, and it may be Mice and Vermine <note place="margin">Simile.</note> run up and down in thoſe rooms that were hung ſo bravely: So it is with many that had excellent gifts which were highly honored and eſteemed of by people that knew them, but now the hangings are gone, now there's nothing but Vermine running up and down in their ſpirits; Oh! what a mighty havock ſin will make in the honor and eſteem of men!</p>
                  <p>Let men therefore take heed of truſting in their former <note place="margin">Uſe. for <hi>Magiſtrats</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> that have bin of Repute.</note> repute, for let them have done what they will heretofore, yet if they depart from God their honor will be gone; Men that are in place of Authority, or in place of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, had need conſider this point well, for it's a matter of great moment for men in place of Authority to keep up their repute and eſteem that they may be the more uſeful and do ſervice, not only for themſelves, but that they may be of the greater uſe to do ſervice for God.

                  <p>Firſt, When <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſpake about the altering of the way of Government, about the taking off of the ten Tribes from the houſe of <hi>David, What portion have we in</hi> David, <hi>and in the houſe of</hi> Jeſſe?

From whence our Notes of Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That alteration in the matter of Government, is a matter of very great hazard and difficulty;</hi> men that have to <note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> deal in any kind of alteration in matter of Government, had need be very wiſe in their carriage in it, in reſpect of the people, for much depends upon them.

That's the Firſt thing that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſpake.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>When he ſpake,</hi> when he firſt mentioned the buſineſs in the Alteration of Religion, this it's like cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <note place="margin">Expoſ. 2.</note> more trembling than the other: What is that <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> ſpake? <hi>That now they were not to go up to worſhip at</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, God did not ſtand upon ſuch things, No, they might ſave that long journy; and ſo there was a Calf

ſet up at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Betbel,</hi> and they muſt go and worſhip there: This was a mighty alteration in the matters of Religion. And ſurely when this was mentioned firſt to the People there could not but be great trembling, the ſpirits of the godly to be ſure they would tremble at ſuch a motion, they would look upon it as a moſt dreadful Curſe of God upon the Kingdom, that there ſhould be ſuch a change in the matters of Religion, from the <hi>Truth</hi> to that which is <hi>Falſe;</hi> and even others too, there was a general trembling, for men have ſome kind of conſcience of Religion and of worſhiping God, this was ſo flat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Word, that where there was but any Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God they could not but have ſom fear, they could not tel what might come of it, and therefore there could not but be a very great concuſſion of ſpirit in the People of the Land, to tremble at ſuch a ſtrange kind of thing as this was: at firſt it was ſo; But yet afterwards they had dead ſpirits, that he might do with them what he would, and ſo joyned with <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and joyned with <hi>Abab,</hi> and ſinned more and more. From this ſpeaking and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, you have theſe Notes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That the Alteration in Religion is a very difficult bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> it cannot be expected but the hearts of People will ſtir much upon the Alteration of Religion, though it be from worſe to better, yet the hearts of People wil ſtir very much at firſt.

And certainly the caſting out of Prelacie hath cauſed a great deal of trembling, a great <note place="margin">Epiſcopacy</note> ado there is, How hard it is to get but any rotten tooth out of a mans head, it coſts a great deal of pain and trouble.

maintainance of our Liberties, as we are Subjects, and Men, and for the Civil-Right we have to our Religion alſo; but yet we ſee that the very thoughts of any kind of change in matters of Religion whatſoever it be, it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the hearts of men to be up, and ſhake, and to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled, it's a matter of great moment the change in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, and therefore requires much Prayer where it is changed, though from the worſe to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If it cauſe trembling when it's changed from the better to the worſe, it wil likewiſe cauſe trembling where it is changed from the worſe to the better; and therfore it requires that al the Godly ſhould joyn al their ſtrength together, againſt thoſe that would oppoſe their ſtrength againſt it.</p>
                  <p>The Second is this, <hi>That men of reſolute ſpirits will go on,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>even in the matters of Religion, though it be from the better to the worſe,</hi> yet you ſhall have ſome men whoſe ſpirits are reſolute that they will go on. Oh! but you will ſay, <hi>The People will not bear nor endure it.</hi> Yea, but they will venture to go on with their way and deſign, though it be from the better to the worſe; but now, if the change be from the worſe to the better, than it's a ſpecial gift of God to give men hearts to go on, notwithſtanding diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
                  <p>And then in the Third place, <hi>He exalted himſelf, though</hi>

                     <hi>there were trembling:</hi> That is, He did prevail in this his way, in this change of Religion, <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things by open violence preſently, it was a great while firſt, but he carried things on by fair ſhews, one thing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, and ſo he prevailed with the People.

                  <p>And then Fourthly, <hi>Then he died, when he ſinned in Baal.</hi>

                  <p>And then the Fifth thing is this, <hi>That a Family or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>

                  <p>Then, <hi>He is dead,</hi> that I take to be the meaning of that in <hi>Mat. 24. 28. For whereſoever the carcaſs is, there will the</hi>

                  <p>And then a Fourth Note is this, <hi>That there is no ſtop in Apoſtaſie;</hi> let men Apoſtatize once from God, and there <note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> is no ſtop then, they cannot tell whither to go then, if once they be rowling down, a man may not think thus, I will but roul thus far, and there I'le ſtop; no, if you be once rouling, you will roul, and roul down to the bottom, and you know not whither you may roul or fall: If a man ſhould leap into the water and ſay, I will but ſink thus far, to the middle and no further, this were but folly, you will ſink more and more: ſo it is with <note place="margin">Simile.</note> Apoſtates, I verily beleeve thoſe that did make ſlight at firſt, they did not think that they ſhould go ſo far, Oh! God forbid that they ſhould do ſuch things as were ſo vile and abominable, yea, but when once they are rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,

There's a Curſe upon the wicked in <hi>Pſal. 35. That God would ſet them in ſlippery places, and that the Angel of God ſhould perſecute them;</hi> when men will go out of the waies of God into the ſlippery paths of their own, it's juſt with God that an evil ſpirit ſhould drive them on in thoſe waies. It is in going from the waies of God, juſt as you ſhall find it in your traveling in Champion Countries, there's a High-way goes to ſuch <note place="margin">Simile</note> a Town, and there's another way that lies cloſe by it, and you (it may be) are got out of the right way, and ſo go on and think it will bring you to the place where you are traveling, but it winds you out of your right way, and ſo you go further and further, out of the right Road, perhaps ſome miles before you are aware of it. And ſo it is in Apoſtacie, it may be at firſt when they are got out of the way of God they think it not ſo much, but then theſe evil waies wind them out by degrees ſo that they grow further and further; <hi>They ſin more and more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I wil give you the ſteps of an Apoſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, going more and <note place="margin">The ſteps of Apoſtacy.</note> more from God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When one doth apoſtatiſe and ſin againſt God, <note place="margin">1.</note> if it be any ſin againſt knowledge, though never ſo little, For ſin of meer infirmity I cannot call Apoſtaſie, but if it be ever ſo little <hi>againſt knowledge,</hi> this breaks the bond of obedience; when I wil venture to do that which I know is againſt God, this bond of obedience being broken, no marvel though you fall and ſin more and more.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Every act of ſin hath ſuch a nature in it, as to encreaſe the habits:</hi> Corruption doth grow by acting. As <note place="margin">2.</note> it is with Grace, every act of Grace doth extend Grace in the heart of a man; the way to grow in Grace is, to act
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:43340:212"/>
Grace much, ſo that when you are acting of your Grace, you do not only that that is your duty, but you are gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing in Grace, for when you are acting of Corruption, you are not only doing that that is evil, but you are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing it, and therefore every ſin that cauſes us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline from God, makes us to go more and more from God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Every ſin that is againſt Conſcience, it weakens</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>the work of Conſcience;</hi> the Authority of Conſcience will quickly be weakened when it is once broken; break but off the yoke of Conſcience, and Conſcience will be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker than it was before: At the firſt time when a man ſins againſt Conſcience, his Conſcience hath a great deal of ſtrength in it, and mightily troubles him at the very firſt, but having had a flaw (as it were) it grows weaker. I remember a notable ſtory which that reverend and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Divine, Doctor <hi>Preſton</hi> hath, of one in <hi>Cambridg</hi> that had committed a great ſin, and he had this temptation <note place="margin">A ſtory rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Dr. <hi>Preſton.</hi>
                     </note> upon him; Do the act again, and your Conſcience will trouble you no more: and this temptation did prevail upon him, he did it again, and then he grew a very ſot indeed, and went on in his wickedneſs: Every ſin doth ſomewhat to weaken Conſcience, and therfore one that fals off from God, will ſin more and more.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>When a man hath once fallen off from God in any</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>degree, according to the degree he doth loſe his comfort that he had in God;</hi> for ſome kind of comforts Hypocrites may have; as there may be Common gifts of the Spirit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to do ſervice, ſo there may be Common Gifts of the Spirit to comfort them; they may taſt of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers <note place="margin">Common Comforts.</note> of the world to come, many have ſome flaſhes of joy; but when they are departed from God then they cannot have ſo much comfort as they were wont to have, and when they have not the comfort they were went to have, they muſt have it ſome way, and they are fain to go ſharking up and down to get it ſome where elſe; I
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:43340:213"/>
cannot have that comfort in God as I was wont to have, I was wont when I was troubled, to go &amp; read the Word, I could find comfort there, let me go into good Company I could find comfort there, let me go into the preſence of God I could find comfort there, but now I cannot, and ſo the heart muſt have comfort ſome way or other, and therefore goes more and more from God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>When one hath ſin'd againſt God, then his ſpirit and holy duties comes to be very unſutable,</hi> they are harder <note place="margin">5.</note> than they were before, it's a more difficult thing to get his heart to any holy duty than before, and ſo comes to neglect Duties, and by neglecting them his Corruption grows, they were a means to reſtrain Corruption verie much; for when a man is abroad and takes liberty, yet when he thinks thus, yea, but I muſt pray before I go to bed, I muſt go to prayer, and how ſhall I beg Grace from God another time, when as I wilfully ſin againſt him? this curbs a man: ſo long as he can keep any kind of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs between his heart and holy duties, though he ſhould fail in ſome kind of things, he would quickly recover; but when he begins to have holy duties ſo vail'd as he leaves off holy duties, then he will ſin more and more, for the curb is taken off.</p>
                  <p>Yea Sixthly, <hi>The preſence of God is terrible to an Apoſtate,</hi> he cannot think of God without ſome terror; before he <note place="margin">6.</note> would often think of God, and ſpeak of God, but now he puts off the thoughts of God becauſe they are terrible to him, and having put off the thoughts of God, and Gods preſence being terrible, it muſt needs be that he muſt wander up and down even more and more, be as a <hi>Cain</hi> wandering away from the preſence of God.</p>
                  <p>Yea further, <hi>The thoughts of whatſoever might turn an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates heart to God, are grievous to him.</hi> If he hath gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, <note place="margin">7.</note> if he thinks of turning to God, Oh preſently will be preſented to him ſome difficulty that will make him even put off al thoſe thoughts, and rather give himſelf li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to his own waies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="435" facs="tcp:43340:213"/>
Yea further, there's this in it, <hi>That when a man hath</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">8.</note> 
                     <hi>ſin'd againſt God, one ſin cannot be maintain'd without ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one ſin calls to another to help it, and maintain it.</hi> As now, you find it ordinarily when a man hath done wrong to another man, he knows not how to carry it out, but by doing him more wrong, to cruſh him if he can: And ſo there's divers other ſins that have many ſins depending upon them, if a man be engaged in a buſineſs that is ſinful, that he might carry out his buſineſs, a great many other ſins he muſt commit, and ſo comes to fall off more and more.</p>
                  <p>Yea further, <hi>The pride of mens hearts is ſuch, as when they</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">9</note> 
                     <hi>are once got into an evil way, it's a mighty difficult thing to keep them from not juſtifying their evil:</hi> men love to juſtifie what they have done; when they have ſin'd, they will grow more reſolute and violent, that all people might think that they have not the leaſt kind of recoil in their hearts, you think many times when you ſee men mighty ſtrong and violent in an evil way, you think ſurely they are <note place="margin">Note.</note> fully ſatisfied in it; Oh! you are mightily miſtaken in that, they may be very violent, and very ſtrong in their way, only that they might perſwade other folk, though their own conſciences tels them, that they are not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and thus the pride of mens hearts makes them ſin more and more.</p>
                  <p>And beſides, <hi>If they have grown far in their ſinful way,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">10.</note> 
                     <hi>then they grow deſperate,</hi> they grow into deſperation, they little hope ever to recover themſelves ſo as before, and therefore go on more and more.</p>
                  <p>Yea, <hi>And God in his juſt Judgment withdraws himſelf</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">11.</note> 
                     <hi>from them.</hi> God withdraws thoſe gifts and common gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that they had, and ſaith God, Let them go on, <hi>He that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, and beſides Gods withdrawing, there's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

God to be a God is a ſpecial part of that Worſhip that is due to God.</p>
                  <p>To acknowledg God to be God, is to know him in his Excellency, Majeſty, &amp; Glory, above what is known of him by the light of Nature.</p>
                  <p>This cannot but have a mighty operation upon the heart. For,</p>
                  <p>To know God to be a God is, 1. To know him to be <note place="margin">What it is to know God.</note> the Firſt being of all. 2. The Infinit, Al<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſufficient God. 3 The Fountain of all good to his Saints.</p>
                  <p>1 <hi>This muſt needs gain the heart to him. 2 There is no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God where this is not. 3 Where this is all follows. 4 The right knowledg of God keeps from falſe worſhip.</hi> Gal. 4. 9. <hi>Since you know God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye to the weak and beggerly elements of the world?</hi> [See the Jewiſh way of Ceremonial worſhip]—<hi>Thou ſhalt know no God but me.</hi> This is the firſt Commandement, of which <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, <hi>All flows from that great Ocean of the firſt Commandement, and again return thither.

                  <p>
                     <hi>It is not good to know Idolaters worſhip at all:</hi> [for this is <note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> ſpoken in the Text by way of oppoſition: <hi>Thou ſhalt know no God but me,</hi> that is, Thou ſhalt be acquainted with no other worſhip, according to that in <hi>Deut. 12. 30.

If you know but any of your friends that when they were lower than now they are, knew God better than now they do, and God knew them, and there was more ſweet converſe between God and them than now there is, put them in mind of this text, <hi>I knew them in the wilderneſs, in the Land of great drought, but now according to their Paſtures they are filled, and their hearts are exalted, and they have forgotten me:</hi> God deliver them from the remaining part of the text, <hi>I'le be a Lyon, and a Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard, and Bear to them to tear them.</hi> You ſeldom find in <note place="margin">None of the Saints worſe for Affliction: many for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity.</note> Scripture any of Gods Saints worſe for afflictions; give me any one example, for my part I know not one in all the Book of God that came worſe out of an affliction than when they went in; But I can tell you of many, even of Gods dear people that came worſe out of proſperity than
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:43340:223"/>
when they came in; therefore it's obſervable in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. 3. it's ſpoken in commendation of <hi>Jeboſhaphat,</hi> it's ſaid that <hi>Jeboſhaphat</hi> walked in the firſt waies of <hi>David</hi> his Father; <hi>David</hi> his Father at firſt was in an afflicted <note place="margin">David.</note> eſtate, afterwards in a more proſperous eſtate; he was hunted like a Partridg at firſt, but when he came to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, his waies were not ſo good, therefore the holy Ghoſt doth put a commendation upon his firſt waies ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than upon his after waies. I fear it may be ſaid ſo of ſome, that their firſt waies when they were low were a great deal better than their after waies. This for the connexion.
<q>According to their Paſtures, ſo were they filled. <note place="margin">Text.</note>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>According to the fatneſs and riches of the Land when <note place="margin">Expoſ.</note> they came into it they were filled; they fell upon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſenſual content they could enjoy to the uttermoſt, according to what means they had for to ſatisfie the fleſh.
<q>According to their Paſtures.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They would improve all the means and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they had for to give content to the fleſh, ſo that they were filled. Thus you ſee men that love to live in the ſatisfaction of the fleſh up to the height of their means, according to all means that they have to ſatisfie the fleſh, this way, or the other way, they will be ſure to have ſatisfaction if it be to be had; therefore you ſhall ſee men that have eſtates, they pleaſe the fleſh to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt they can think of; if they go abroad and ſee any thing that may give content to the fleſh, they reſolve to have it if they can when they come home. According to all the means that they have ſo they will have the fleſh ſatisfied. Oh! how happy were men if they were ſo wiſe for their ſouls, if according to the means of grace we ſought to fill our ſouls: Oh how doth the Lord
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:43340:223"/>
lead us in green Paſtures, and yet what empty ſouls have we!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>According to their Paſtures, ſo were they filled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But can we ſay, that according to our green Paſtures that God leads us in, ſo are we filled? Oh! we live in green Paſtures, and yet are empty. Here we ſee that men regard their bodies, regard the ſenſual pleaſures of the fleſh abundantly more than ſpiritual, as if there were a greater good in ſenſual delights, than there is in all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual comforts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>According to their Paſtures they were filled,</hi> they were <hi>fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;</hi> twice we have <hi>filled, filled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>little</hi> will ſerve the turn in Spiritual things for men, but they will <hi>fill,</hi> and <hi>fill</hi> up again themſelves in <note place="margin">Note.</note> ſenſual things.</p>
                  <p>It notes the greedineſs of their ſpirits in falling upon thoſe Contentments they had to the fleſh. When they came into a fertile Land they were filled, they were fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; ſuch is the nature of men that are carnal, to fall with greedineſs upon contentments to the fleſh, and to think on nothing but filling themſelves, filling, filling, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 29. you may ſee what their diſpoſition was, even before they came into ther fat Paſtures, when God but in the wilderneſs granted them fleſh, ſo <hi>they did eat</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>and were well filled:</hi> ſo it is in your books: but it is, They were filled <hi>very much,</hi> they were filled exceedingly, <hi>Valde,</hi> they were filled, that's the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Hebrew phraſe there; Oh! they filled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the uttermoſt they could. And you may ſee a diſcription of the greedineſs of mens hearts to carnal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, when they have any opportunity to enjoy them, in <hi>Prov. 23. 5. Wilt thou ſee thine eyes upon that which is not?</hi> you have it thus in your books, Wilt thou ſet <note place="margin">Prov. 23. 5. Noted.</note> thine eyes upon that which is not? (ſpeaking of riches) Now it is according to the Hebrew, <hi>Will ye make your eyes to fly upon that which is not?</hi> A carnal heart when he ſees
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:43340:224"/>
any way of enjoyment of carnal contentments, he makes his eyes to fly upon them, to fly upon them with eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there was a mighty greedineſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>According to their Paſtures they were filled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They thought of nothing but filling themſelves, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there ſhould have been the mixture of other thoughts, when God brought them into their fat paſtures, there ſhould have been ſuch thoughts as theſe mixed with the enjoyment of the comſorts that God gave them, It's true, that we may enjoy what God gives us, comforts, yet, but we muſt not only ſeek to fill our ſelves, but we are to labor to mix theſe kind of thoughts with the good things that we do enjoy: As thus now;</p>
                  <p>Here I come to enjoy abundance of good in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <note place="margin">What <hi>thoughts</hi> we ſhould have about enjoying out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>comforts.</hi> 1.</note> Whence have I all this? is it not from God? They did not think of this, ſo be it that they may fill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, like the Swine under the Acorn Tree ſeeks to fill the belly, but never looks from whence the Acorns come; ſo carnal hearts, they fill themſelves, but never look from whence they come; whereas a gracious heart may take the comforts of the creature that God affords, but while it's receiving of them, it looks up to God the Principal of all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What do I think God aims at? God gives me abundance of the creature, but what is Gods end? is <note place="margin">2.</note> it only to ſatisfie my fleſh? hath God no further end than this?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I come now to fit my ſelf with theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, but what opportunities have I by theſe to do <note place="margin">3.</note> good more than before? Surely theſe are not given me meerly to pamper the fleſh, theſe are given me as large opportunities of ſervice for God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Now I come to enjoy abundance, What's the rule that God hath ſet in the Word for the ordering <note place="margin">4.</note> of my heart in what I do enjoy?</p>
                  <p>Again, I come to have much now in the world more <note place="margin">5.</note>
                     <pb n="457" facs="tcp:43340:224"/>
than before; but O my unworthineſs! how unworthy am <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>of theſe comforts I have? unworthy of the leaſt bit of bread, and yet my Table is furniſhed, and I am fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: Oh! but carnal hearts they fall upon their diſhes, and powr down their full cups, and never think of their unworthineſ, how unworthy they are of the leaſt drop of water.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, God gives me abundance of the Creature: but <note place="margin">6.</note> what is it that makes the difference between me and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? others there are that are empty enough, their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are empty, their houſes empty, their cupboards em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty; but I am filled, Why ſhould God deal thus with me rather than with others?</p>
                  <p>Again, I come to enjoy abundance here in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: <note place="margin">7.</note> But is there not danger, is there not a ſnare in what I do enjoy? have not I a naughty vile heart? How if theſe ſhould prove to be temptations to me to draw my heart from God; were I not better be without them? It's made (in the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> 12. verſ.) an argument of one that is carnal and wicked, that he doth <hi>feaſt without fear,</hi> he fals upon what is before him and fils himſelf, but without fear; whereas we ſhould never enjoy fulneſs in the world, but we ſhould mix fear with it: theſe thoughts ſhould make us fear the ſnare that there may be in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
                  <p>Further, I have abundance; but what uncertainty <note place="margin">8.</note> is there in all theſe things? I have it now, but how quickly may it be gone? theſe things taken from me, or I from them.</p>
                  <p>Again, I have much, and therefore I have a great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt <note place="margin">9</note> to give to God of theſe Paſtures that now I have, this Fulneſſe that now I enjoy will make my accompt to be ſo much the greater.</p>
                  <p>I have much, Oh but conſidering how little ſervice I <note place="margin">10.</note> do for God, may not I fear that this I have it is to be my portion?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="458" facs="tcp:43340:225"/>
I have much, but have I not much engagements with <note place="margin">11.</note> what I do enjoy? that fulneſs that I have, doth it not more fully engage me unto God than others? Carnal hearts are void of theſe thoughts in the enjoyment of their fulneſs, they care not, ſobeit they can but fil them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, how they get what they have, or uſe it.</p>
                  <p>Oh my brethren, our hearts ſhould be filled with theſe thoughts in our fulneſs; But it is with moſt as we reade in <hi>Iſa. 56. 12. Come ye, ſay they, I will fetch Wine, and we will fill our ſelves with ſtrong Drink; and to morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more abundant:</hi> there's all that they care. And eſpecially thoſe fall moſt greedily upon carnal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments that have been kept ſhort a long time. So it was here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I knew thee in the wilderneſs: But according to their Paſtures they were filled;</hi> they were filled, they minded nothing but filling themſelves, now they gormundize, now they fill themſelves; As it's uſual with them that have lived very ſparingly and meanly before, if they come to a ful dyet they fill themſelves greedily more than others, ſo as to diſtemper themſelves, and occaſion Plagues and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous <note place="margin">Note.</note> diſeaſes by filling themſelves greedily when they come to fuller dyet than formerly they did enjoy; when a man hath faſted to ſtarving almoſt, he had need be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry careful what he doth when he comes to a full Table: Phyſitians will not ſuffer men that have faſted long to eat much; It's that which brings many diſeaſes in Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and others, becauſe ſometimes they want much, and ſometimes they have abundance, and ſo they ſpoil them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: As we read of <hi>Saul</hi>'s men that they fell upon the Cattel ſo as they did eat the blood they were ſo greedy of it. Oh let us take heed of this, this ſhould be a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Leſſon to thoſe that have known what emptineſs hath meant in theſe times, and now they are going into their Countries again, and to enjoy their Poſſeſſions, Oh let them take heed how they fal upon the comforts of the
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:43340:225"/>
Creature greedily, Oh they ſhould rather prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before hand, and ſeaſon their hearts with thoſe thoughts, that may keep them from the danger that there is in fatneſs; and when they come to their Houſes and Lands, and begin to ſtock them again, they ſhould think, Oh! what were thoſe ſins of mine when I was here before in my houſe, and enjoyed fulneſs? how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle honor had God by my fulneſs before! Oh! let me now remember all my murmurings and repinings when God took away my eſtate, and let me ſeek to make peace with God even for them; In the time of my diſtreſs, I cried to God then, and I was afraid that I ſhould never come to enjoy my eſtate again, and hath God given it to me again? Oh let me improve it better for his Service than ever I have done. Such kind of thoughts men ſhould have when they come to their eſtates again, and not to fall upon them, and only ſeek to make up all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and think of nothing elſe. There's a great deal of danger here, God hath waies to make men caſt out their ſweet morſels when they regard nothing but the filling of themſelves. It follows;
<q>And their hearts were exalted. <note place="margin">Text</note>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This their fulneſs puft them up; Pride is an ordinary diſeaſe that follows fulneſs. Saith an Ancient, <hi>It's hard to be in honor without ſwelling;</hi> Pride is the diſeaſe of proſperity, in <hi>Pſal. 73. 3. I ſaw the proſperity of the wic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked,</hi>

                     </note> and ſo on, he deſcribes their proſperity, and in the 6. verſ. <hi>Therefore pride compaſſes them about as a chain, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence covereth them as a garment:</hi> and hence that caveat of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 17.

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe that theſe things in the world, they are
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:43340:226"/>
great things in their eyes, yea, they are the only good things to a carnal heart, they are his happineſs, and therefore he bleſſes himſelf in them, and that puffs him up.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When they enjoy fulneſs in the world, <note place="margin">2.</note> then their luſts are ſatisfied, then they have fewell for their luſts, and their luſts grows mighty high.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They can live of themſelves and depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on none, and this it is that puffs them up, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 5. <note place="margin">3.</note> (ſpeaking of proud men in proſperity) <hi>They puff at their Enemies,</hi> they care for no body in the world, they can live of themſelves; others depend upon them, and they depend upon none, and this puffs them up.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They conceive ſome excellency in themſelves, why they have more than others, as if it were becauſe <note place="margin">4</note> they had more excellency in themſelves, and were more worthy than others; and they are not every body, but are culd out among others as the prime and chief, as if there were more worth in them: this puffs them up.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, They ſee all others deſire what they have, <note place="margin">5.</note> they ſee a great diſtance between them and others, and thoſe that are under them do highly eſteem of them, <hi>They call the proud, happy,</hi> they have many flatterers. They were fill'd, and their hearts were exalted, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>men,</hi> but above <hi>God. Pſal. 73. 9. They ſet their mouths againſt Heaven, and their tongue walketh through the Earth.</hi> (ſpeaking of wicked men in proſperity) They wil ſpeak againſt every one when they are high themſelves, ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the waies of God, and at his Saints; When is the time wherein wicked men that are of ſcornful ſpirits, do ſcorn and ſpeak moſt roughly againſt the people of God and the waies of God, but when they are fill'd, when they are at Taverns and have fill'd themſelves with Wine and good Cheer, then they ſcorn, and blaſpheme, and ſet their mouths againſt Heaven, and their tongues walk throughout the City and Country, againſt <hi>Parliament</hi>
                     <pb n="461" facs="tcp:43340:226"/>
and all; their tongues are free at that time, it is when they are filled. Hence that Scripture in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35. 16. <note place="margin">Pſal. 35. 16. Noted.</note> 
                     <hi>With hypocritical mockers in feaſts, they gnaſhed upon me with their teeth:</hi> in the time of their feaſts when they were fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, then they were mockers, and then they gnaſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me. Oh abundance of evil is done by ſcorning and contemning at Feaſts, and in that reſpect their Wine that then they fill themſelves withal may be called by the name of that in <hi>Deut. 32. 33. Their Wine is the poyſon</hi>

                     <hi>of Dragons, and the cruel venem of Aſps;</hi> for as it fills their bodies with heat, ſo then their ſpirits are fill'd with rage, and mallice; and eſpecially thoſe who were heretofore low, if <hi>They</hi> come to be fill'd, <hi>Their</hi> hearts are moſt exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Oh! the ſad examples we have of this at this day, many that were not long ſince we know in a low and mean condition, and they have gotten places, they have got eſtates and power in their hands, Oh how are their hearts exalted! Would you ever have thought to have liv'd to the time to have ſeen ſuch a change in their ſpirits as at this day? how do they diſcover their pride <note place="margin">Notes of the pride of ſome new Officers. 1</note> now they are got up?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in their eſtrangement towards thoſe that they were familiar with heretofore, they go aloof off from you, they are fill'd, and now their hearts are exalted.</p>
                  <p>And then Secondly, their carriage is very high and <note place="margin">2.</note> lofty, you muſt wait now if you would but ſpeak to them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, now they need no advice or counſel; they <note place="margin">3</note> were wont to communicate themſelves to you, and to be willing to hearken to advice and counſel, yea, but they are fill'd now and their hearts are exalted, as if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of their eſtates put more wit into their heads.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Now they are harſh; to thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">4.</note> them they ſpeak harſhly and ruggedly, and care not for any under them; when they lived formerly among their neighbors then they would complain of harſhneſs
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:43340:227"/>
and ridgidneſs of others, but ſince they are filled they are as harſh as any; and ſo before, when they were low they cryed out of oppreſſion, but when they come once to be in place themſelves and be filled, then they go the ſame waies that others go; hence that in <hi>Pſal. 73. 8. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 73. 8. Obſerved.</note> 
                     <hi>oppreſſion, they ſpeak loftily.</hi> If you complain of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, you have lofty expreſſions from them; It's ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of wicked men in proſperity.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, They ſhew their pride; when they are filled they cannot beat contradiction now as they were wont <note place="margin">5.</note> to do, they cannot endure reprehenſion now.</p>
                  <p>Again, Thoſe mercies that not long ſince they would <note place="margin">6.</note> have highly prized, now they ſlight them, now they are mean things.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, All the uſe they make of what they do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy <note place="margin">7</note> now more than before, it is to get higher and higher, there's all the uſe they make of all. Thoſe that have bin low and mean in their eſtates heretofore, now they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be filled, their hearts are exalted, and thus do they diſcover the exaltation of their hearts. Oh! but this is a great and a ſore evil, for ſo 'tis rebuk'd by the Prophet. Oh thou that haſt thy heart exalted, being fill'd it is a <note place="margin">Why we ſhould not be exalted by proſperity. 1.</note> ſign thou haſt a poor, low ſpirit of thine own, to be lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up with thoſe things that thou doeſt enjoy.</p>
                  <p>For Firſt, What low and mean things are they? What are they but crums that the Maſter of the Familie caſts to Dogs? They are ſuch things as make thee never a whit <note place="margin">2.</note> the better, nor the more excellent; Indeed it's ſaid, that knowledg puffs up the heart, for that puts an excellency upon the man: <hi>The heart of the wicked is little worth, let him have never ſo much proſperity.</hi> Thoſe things that thou pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thy ſelf in, they are no other than may be the portion <note place="margin">3.</note> of a Reprobate, and have been, they are no other than may ſtand with Gods eternal hatred of thee, and Gods eternal wrath againſt thee: Yea, they are ſuch things as <note place="margin">4.</note> may come from Gods wrath, and like enough they do,
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:43340:227"/>
and it's a ſign they do when thou art filled with them, and thereby puft up by them, it's a ſign that there's a curſ mixed with what thou haſt filled thy ſelf withal. If a man comes to a Table and eats, and then he ſwels preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon it, God be merciful to me, am I poiſoned, ſaith <note place="margin">An apt ſimile</note> he? If thou filleſt thy ſelf, and art puft up, it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thy proſperity is poiſoned, there's the curſe of God in it: Had not you rather have the courſeſt dyet that is wholſom, than the daintieſt diſh with poiſon in it? Is it not better to have the Ruſſet Coat that is not dangerous, than a Velvet Coat that hath the Plague in it? Thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, if thou kneweſt it, it may be was a great deal bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before. Oh that any Conſiderations might prick the bladders of mens ſpirits that are ſo puft up with outward proſperity; Thou art leſ, filled with ſpiritual good than <note place="margin">5.</note> before, That that is <hi>ſubſtance</hi> thou haſt loſt, and thou art filled with wind. Ere long what thou haſt muſt be taken <note place="margin">6.</note> away; And perhaps the <hi>right to what thou daeſt enjoy, it is but the right that a Malefactor hath to his ſupper, before the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">7.</note>

                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe their hearts are very much hardened in their ſin, their ſin is grown to a height.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe there are ſo many creatures that they have uſe of more than others that do cry againſt <note place="margin">2.</note> them, Poor people have not ſo many creatures to cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them as the rich have.</p>

                     <hi>As a Lyon.</hi> You have a paralel Scripture in <hi>Pſal. 50. 22. I held my tongue, and ye thought I was like unto you; but conſider this ye that forget God, leſt I tear you in pieces, and</hi>

                     <hi>there be none to deliver:</hi> their hearts were exalted, they forgot God, therefore will I be to them as a Lyon.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>A Lyon,</hi> is the moſt terrible creature, <hi>Amos, 3. If the Lyon roar, the Beaſts tremble.</hi> Oh my Brethren, the threats of God ſhould be to us as the roaring of a Lyon, and our hearts ſhould tremble at them.</p>

                     <hi>Mich.</hi> 5. 8. as a yong Lyon among the flocks of Sheep, who if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver; none can deliver out of Gods hand.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>A Lyon</hi> is ſtrong and cruſhes the whol com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages <note place="margin">3.</note> of a mans bones at one cruſh; Alas man, what is he? In <hi>Job,</hi> 4. 19. he is cruſhed before the <hi>Moth,</hi> much more before a <hi>Lyon</hi> then; Oh then much more before the Lord God when he comes to be as a Lyon.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is obſerved of the Lyon, that ſhe will <note place="margin">4.</note> narrowly mark any one that wounds her, if there were hundreds of men together, and one did but wound it, or ſhoot at it, or do any thing to it, ſhe will be ſure to mark that man. Oh! the Lord mark out thoſe that ſin againſt him, and that wounds his Name, they muſt not think to eſcape among others. The Lords eye is upon them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</p>
                  <p>And it is obſerved of the Lyon, that ſhe ſleeps but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, <note place="margin">5.</note> and with her eyes open; ſo the Lord: As he that keeps <hi>Iſrael</hi> neither ſlumbereth nor ſleepeth, ſo he that deſtroies his enemies doth not ſlumber nor ſleep.</p>
                  <p>Further, The Lyon will fall upon no creature except <note place="margin">6.</note> it be in hunger, or be provok'd: the Lord though his wrath be terrible as a Lyon, yet he is not ſo ready to fall upon his creature, it muſt be from ſome ſpecial end that he hath, or ſome provocation that he hath, but then he falls terribly indeed.</p>
                  <p>Again, It is obſerved of the Lyon, that if you do but <note place="margin">7</note> fall down on the ground, and ſubmit and yeeld, the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Salis eſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraſſe Leoni,</note> doth uſe to paſs by, and will not tear and rend where there is an humble ſubmiſſion to him, whereas other creatures will. Oh thus God is a Lyon terrible, but yet only to thoſe that ſtand out againſt him.</p>
                  <p>And the Naturaliſts obſerve of the Lyon, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <note place="margin">8.</note> endure to be look'd aſquint upon by any; thus it is with the Lord, the Lord loves no ſquint-eyed Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,

I mean none that have by ends of their own, the Lord loves uprightneſs in our waies and dealings.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, They ſay of the Lyon, that it is a great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy <note place="margin">9</note> to <hi>Apes,</hi> and <hi>Welves;</hi> ſo is God to <hi>Flatterers,</hi> and <hi>Tyrants.</hi> Thus God is compared a <hi>Lyon.</hi>

                  <p>Further, It is obſerved of the <hi>Leopard,</hi> that when it comes upon its prey, it leaps upon it ſuddenly: and ſo doth the Lord to ungodly men, he comes in a ſudden way and leaps upon them; and therefore you muſt not think that you are as wel becauſe you are in as ſafe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as you were a year ſince, or ſeven years ſince; It is as wel with me (ſaith one) as it hath been with me in all my life-time; what then? you may be never a whit the further off from dangers, for the way of God in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his wrath, it is ſudden many times.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, It is obſerved of the <hi>Leopard,</hi> that ſometimes it will ſleep a very long time together, it is ſaid to ſleep <hi>three daies</hi> together; but after it awakes it is more fierce than before: And ſo the Lord, though ſometimes he may be patient towards ſinners, yet when he comes to awake out of his ſleep (as he ſpeaks of himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 65.) he is more terrible.</p>

of this or that thing that God did deny to them, it's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God put them into ſuch and ſuch a condition, but never come to charge themſelves: but the Propet ſpeaks here in a compaſſionat way, Oh <hi>Iſrael</hi> (ſaith he) never ſtand charging it upon God, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>God knows how to turn all the evil upon our</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 2</note> 
                     <hi>ſelves, God knows how to right himſelf;</hi> Though we may think to leſſen our evil by putting it upon God, God will turn it all upon our own heads, and make it out to all the world that we were the cauſe of al the evils that were upon us, both temporal evils, and all the evil that ſhal come upon thoſe that ſhall periſh eternally, it will be <note place="margin">One work of the day of Judment.</note> one of the great works at the day of Judgment, To make it out to men and Angels, that all the miſery that comes upon the damned it is from themſelves, and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences will acknowledg it, and God wil be cleered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all; it will be found that the cauſe of mans perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is not the Decree of God, <hi>Gods Decree it damns none,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Gods Decree damns none. What it is.</note> It is their <hi>Sin</hi> that damns them, not the <hi>Decree.</hi> The <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cree of Reprobation it is but the leaving of men to be dealt withal in a way of Juſtice:</hi> whereas ſaith God, here's a company I am reſolved to magnifie my Grace upon to all eternity, <note place="margin">The Decree of Election.</note> Whatſoever comes between to hinder it, I am reſolved that theſe ſhal be the ſubjects for me to exerciſe my Grace on toal eternity, that's <hi>Election:</hi> But there are others that I wil have to a way and courſe of Juſtice, they ſhal have what they earn, and no otherwiſe; ſo that the Decree is not the cauſe of mens damnation, their ſin comes in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that and their damnation, ſo that they deſtroy themſelv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Thirdly, <hi>It is not by any coaction.</hi> You will ſay, Though <note place="margin">3.</note> ſin is in men for the cauſe of it, yet men cannot help it, man cannot but ſin. Now to that; Firſt, God made man in ſuch a condition, that he might not have ſinned, and though there be a neceſſity, that man fallen cannot but ſin, yet it excuſes not this neceſſity, <hi>He ſins as freely as if he could do otherwiſe.</hi> Men, though it's true, through <note place="margin">Note.</note> their fall they cannot do that that is good, they cannot but ſin, <hi>Eyes full of Adultry that cannot ceaſe from ſin,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith of ſome, yet they ſin as freely as if they had power to keep from ſin, <hi>It's that that pleaſes their wills,</hi> it's that that is ſutable unto them, It's true, that the <hi>Saints in Heaven they cannot but glorifie God, but yet they glorifie God with freedom too,</hi> they are ſo ſet in an eſtate of glory, as they cannot ſin, but yet they honor God freely, that is, <hi>They do that that's ſutable to their own ſpirits</hi> in the honoring of God; if ſo be that there be a neceſſity of ſinning from mans fall. Yea, 2. <hi>From a judicial act of God in giving men over to ſin, yet that's but in a way of puniſhment for former ſins,</hi> and they bring this upon themſelves, ſo ſtill they deſtroy themſelves. <hi>Every ſinner that periſhes, murders him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> And all that are damn'd eternally, they all of them are <hi>Self murderers,</hi> this is a grievous thing, <hi>O Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf.</hi> The more there is of <hi>Self</hi> in mens deſtruction, the more grievous is their condition; It would make our hearts to pity any Fowl that ſhould be ſhot with an Arrow that was feathered from her own body: all the Judgments of God, all the Arrows of the Almighty that come againſt ſinners, they are a it were feathered by that that comes from ſinners themſelves, they are the cauſe of their own evils: <hi>The moreſelf in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners deſtruction the more hard is our condition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As Firſt, When men do ſo bring miſerie pon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <note place="margin">Wherein Self appears in ſin. 1.</note> without any temptation, the leſs temptation, the more ſelf in any thing, and ſome deſtroy themſelves ſo, it comes meerly from themſelves without any temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="513" facs="tcp:43340:237"/>
Secondly, When mens ſins are plotted ſins, contriv'd <note place="margin">2.</note> ſins, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>he more plotting and contriving about ſin, the more art thou the Author of thine own evil or deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When men ſin, and yet are warn'd before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand <note place="margin">3.</note> of their ſin, they are told beforehand of the evil yet ſtill are wilful in it, and will go on in it, they may thank themſelves for their deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, When men notwithſtanding they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <note place="margin">4.</note> ſtop'd in the way of their ſin, and though God doth many times come in the way of his providence, and in his Word to ſtop them in their way of ſin, and yet ſtill they will go on, thank thy ſelf if thou beeſt undone.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The more means they have to the contrary, <note place="margin">5.</note> the more enlightenings they have, the more drawings of the holy Ghoſt they have to draw them from their ſin, and yet ſtill will go on.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, When mens ſins are of that nature, that <note place="margin">6.</note> they do not only deſerve their deſtruction, but they do work their deſtruction; all ſins deſerves it, but ſome ſins works it: as drunkenneſs works diſeaſes in mens bodies, brings them to Poxes, and Feavers, and ſo they deſtroy them, their very ſin deſtroies them: and ſo ſome others might be named.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, When men ſhall preſume to venture fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">7.</note> in any danger than they can help themſelves out of, they think they will go but ſo far, and ſo far, and ſo they venture further than they can help themſelves out of; they deſtroy themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Now this evil of <hi>Self deſtruction</hi> is ſo much the more <note place="margin">An Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtruction.</note> grievous, when men deſtroy themſelves in things that they moſt bleſs themſelves in, in things that they do moſt ſeek themſelves in, they moſt glorifie themſelves in, I mean, in which they do moſt glory, and in which they do promiſe to themſelves greater good, if this proves to be their deſtruction, it is ſo much the more grievous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="514" facs="tcp:43340:238"/>
Oh! it is a ſad thing to be a ſelf-deſtroyer, for what <note place="margin">1.</note> pity can there be? Who will pity a man or woman that is the cauſe of all their own evil, wilfully brings it upon themſelves? You will ſay, Thank your ſelves, who will pity you? Oh! this will be the condition of all that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; Neither <hi>God,</hi> nor <hi>Angels,</hi> nor <hi>Saints</hi> ſhall pitie them: neither the <hi>Father</hi> out of whoſe loyns they came <note place="margin">Note.</note> ſhall pitie them, nor the <hi>Mother</hi> out of whoſe bodie, for they ſhall ſee that they have undone themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And beſides, Oh the extream vexation that there will be in mens ſpirits, when they ſhall be convinc'd of this, <note place="margin">2.</note> when the Lord ſhall preſent to them all the means they have had, and all the mercies they have enjoyed, ſo that their conſciences ſhall fly in their faces and tel them, Oh you may thank your ſelves for this, it was that wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched heart of thine that thou haſt ſo talk'd of, I told you of this before, Oh! that pride, and that hypocriſie, and that <hi>Self ſeeking,</hi> and that falſneſs of thine hath brought thee to all this. Oh this will be an eternal vexation, it will be the matter for the worm to gnaw upon in Hell hereafter, Oh! that we have deſtroyed our ſelves!</p>
                  <p>And beſides, God will revenge this upon men: for no man hath the power over himſelf; thou deſtroyeſt one <note place="margin">3.</note> of Gods creatures in being a ſelf-murderer, thou ſhalt be puniſhed for deſtroying thy ſelf. Becauſe they have not the diſpoſe of themſelves, they are Gods Creatures; <hi>And here it is a greater ſin for a man to murder, Himſelf, than his Father or Mother.</hi> It was a Speech of <hi>Auſtin</hi> that way, <note place="margin">Auſtin.</note> It's a greater ſin than paracide, to be a ſelf-murderer, and the reaſon he gives is this, <hi>For ſaith he, the neerer any one is to one, the greater is the ſin of murdering that one;</hi> As <note place="margin">Note.</note> it's a greater ſin for me to murder a kinſman than a ſtranger, It's a greater ſin to murder a brother than a kinſman more remote, than yet higher, a greater ſin for me to murder a father then a brother, but then it's a greater ſin for me to murder my ſelf than my father,
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:43340:238"/>
Why? For I am neerer my ſelf than my father: and ſo the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>is greater for any one to lay violent hands upon ones ſelf, than upon another: You think it a horrid thing if the Devil ſhould come with a temptation, Go and take a halter and hang up your mother that bore you, or take a knife and cut your fathers throat; but when you are tempted to murder your ſelves it is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſin. Self-murder it is a great evil, and yet all people in the world that periſh are ſelf murderers, when we do but hear of a man that hangs or drowns himſelf, we think it's a very ſad thing; now when you look upon wicked men going on in the waies of ſin and deſtruction, look upon them as ſo many men running to drown themſelves, and plunge themſelves into the bottomleſs gulf, and as ſo many men cutting their own throats, and hanging themſelves, for certainly ſo they do.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>learn we to charge our ſelves of all the evil that is upon</hi>

a wretched vile heart have I! when as it may not be it, but meer ſuggeſtions and temptations of the Devil and not the ſteam and filth of his heart, but he doth judg his heart from thoſe temptations, and thinks it is nothing but the uncleanneſs and filthineſs of his heart: but you ſhall have another man that hath a moſt filthy wicked heart, and there comes moſt abominable ſteams which break forth into filthy diſeaſes, and though it comes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together from himſelf, yet ſaith he, Oh the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Devil doth leade me aſide, and I cannot tell how to reſiſt him, it's from temptations, it's from thy ſelf, from that wicked unclean heart of thine, and were there no Devils in Hell at all, thou haſt the ſeeds of all ſin in thy heart, it's from thy uncleanneſs.</p>

I hope your conſciences ſhalbe witneſs that there ſhal not be the leaſt ſtraining of it, but to give you the ſtorie of the thing, and the temper of the people at this time; it appears plainly that there was three things that they <note place="margin">The Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the Ten Tribes: 1 King. 2 City. 3 Nobles.</note> much reſted upon: ſay they, Let the Prophet ſay what he will, we have the King for us, and the Citie for us, and the Nobles for us, put King, and Citie, and Nobles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and who can prevail? ſaith God, Where's your King that ſhould ſave you in your Cities? and your Judges, of whom ye ſaid, Give us a King and Princes, and Nobles. There's theſe three put together. If our King come to the Cities he will have a partie there, and there will be ſtrength in the Citie, and we know the Cities are able to command all the Country, and Kingdom, there's the <hi>Militia,</hi> and a numerous company of men, and there's riches in the Cities, and therefore the King to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them, and then having the Nobles of the

Land, and the Princes, we are ſure in a ſafe condition, and yet in the midſt of this he asks them, by way if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion and inſultation.</p>
                  <p>For ſo it is, <hi>Where is your King that ſhould ſave you in your Cities?</hi> The Notes from the words are theſe:</p>

                  <p>Yea, Secondly, <hi>God loves to inſult over men in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>

And we find in Scripture many ſuch kind of Inſultings over men: in <hi>Deut. 32. 37. Where are your Gods that ſhould deliver you?</hi> And in <hi>Iſ. 19. 12. Where are thy Wiſe-men?</hi> What, we have got Stateſ-men, men known in State Affairs, we have them with us. But where are they, ſaith God? Thus the Lord inſults over men that put their confidence in the fleſh, and eſpecially when they have been confident in their own waies, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking God, and ſo bringing themſelves to miſery; when they have brought themſelves to miſery by forſaking the waies of God, now God inſults, now where are theſe things that you put ſuch confidence in?</p>
                  <p>And truly, even the Saints, ſo be it they do it in an holy humble way, they may have ſome kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting over ungodly men, only becauſe they have ſo much fleſh in them, there's danger, therefore they had need keep their hearts very low: But if they do it in the ſtrength of God; we have it in Scripture, <hi>That the Virgin, Daughter of Zion ſhall laugh at them, and laugh them to ſcorn.</hi>
                     <pb n="527" facs="tcp:43340:244"/>
Only keep your hearts (I ſay) low, and you may come to ſee the Glory of God; even inſult in this, <hi>That God hath heard your Prayer,</hi> and hath been with his People, and that the Enemy hath had ſo much power and ſtrength in the fleſh, and yet how the Lord hath diſappointed them.</p>
                  <p>And then further, <hi>This is the great confuſion to carnal</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>There are theſe Seven REASONS that may be given for it, nothing would ſatisfie them but a King on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Somewhat even for novelty ſake;</hi> they had other <note place="margin">1</note> kind of Government before, but now they would have ſomewhat more, <hi>Mens ſpirits are very much given to change,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Note</note> though they can give no account in the world for the thing.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, <hi>There might be ſome diſtruſt in them, in</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>their former Judges,</hi> becauſe they were men of meaner rank (as I told you) they might think that they ſhould not be able to help them, Oh ſay they, Let us have a King that ſhall go before us in our Wars. Though they had never ſo much experience of the Judges, yet they thought there would be more good if they had great ones, and they were afraid that theſe men of a lower, meaner rank would fail them at laſt.</p>
                  <p>And then a Third reaſon is, <hi>That they might be like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>Nations,</hi> becauſe they loved pomp, What ſay they, Shall we ſee our neighbor Nations to be governed by thoſe that have great pomp and glory, and ſhall we be governed by men that were but <hi>Trades-men</hi> a while ago? No, they would be like other Nations.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is like they had <hi>ſome oppreſſions upon them</hi>

                     <hi>even from the former Judges;</hi> though moſt of them were good, yet certainly there cannot be a <hi>Government of Men</hi> but there wil be ſome cauſe at one time or other for ſome to complain: <hi>Take the beſt Government that can be in the</hi>

                     <hi>world, yet ſeeing it is a Government of men, by men, there will be ſome cauſe or other to complain at ſome time or other.</hi> Now this is the peeviſhneſs of mens hearts, that if there be but any condition wherein they ſuffer, they do nothing but complain of their ſuffering, and therefore would fain have a new way; and never think of the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſufferings that would come in by that new way;
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:43340:247"/>
Oh! they would be rid of theſe that now they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and would have a King, theſe men angred them, theſe men laid ſome taxes upon them that they were not pleaſ'd withal, now ſo be it they might be rid of them, they car'd not what they bring upon themſelves, and therefore they would have a King, not minding what ſufferings they ſhould bring upon themſelves in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother kind.</p>
                  <p>And then Fifthly, A King they would have out of a <hi>ſpirit of oppoſition againſt that way that God had ſet;</hi> God <note place="margin">5.</note> was in a way of governing of them, and their hearts was againſt that way of God, a meer ſpirit of oppoſition, though they would give no reaſon why they might not be as well that way as another: but it was Gods way, <hi>And there is an oppoſition in the heart of man to any thing that</hi>

                     <hi>hath God in it;</hi> the more any thing hath of God in it, and the more God rules in a way, the more oppoſite are the hearts of evil men.</p>
                  <p>And then a Sixth Reaſon is this, <hi>They had ſome hopes that they ſhould have ſome more liberty for their luſts.</hi> Now <note place="margin">6.</note> having ſuch a way of Government as they had there was more inſpection over them, and they could not ſo eaſily corrupt them, but now in the Government of one man over them, if they can but make a friend to him they may do what they liſt, they might brave it over all their other neighbors, if they would be but willing to be a ſlave to him, they might make all their neighbors ſlaves to them, they had a great deal more hopes of libertie for their luſts it's like this way than the other.</p>
                  <p>And then laſtlie, <hi>Many of them had hopes to get prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">7.</note> 
                     <hi>this way:</hi> let us have a King and Princes, and we ſhall get preferments in the Court, and Places this way, and therefore this is the beſt way, we will not be ſatisfied with any other way but this, we live in a mean low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition without this, but we ſhall get preferments this way, therefore give us a King.</p>

But now that's obſervable, Though they thought they had agreed deal of Reaſon for themſelves, yet after they had once ſmarted, and they found indeed that there was that oppreſſion upon them after they had a King and theſe Princes more than ever they were under in their lives, now was a time that <hi>Hoſea</hi> could ſpeak freely to them, and ſay in the Name of God, Where is your King, and thoſe men that you were ſo earneſt for? what good have you got? For it is obſervable though they were never ſo eager upon having a King, yet if you reade the ſtory in <hi>Samuel,</hi> when God did but thunder from Heaven, Oh! then <hi>we have ſinned;</hi> and when they were under oppreſſion, then <hi>Hoſea</hi> could ſpeak freelie and plainlie to them, <hi>Where is your King?</hi> and where are theſe men?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Men will not hear ſo long as they do not ſuffer;</hi> If men be <note place="margin">Obſ.</note> once ſet upon a way, and have their Eſtates about them, and countenance from great ones, ſpeak what you will againſt their way, they will not hear you; but let theſe men ſmart for their way, and find by experience the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of it, then you may ſpeak to them and ſay, Do you think now that it was wiſelie done, that that you were ſo eager upon? do you think you dealt well for your ſelves? Oh then they will be readie to ſay, I confeſs I did not think ſo ſeriouſlie of thoſe things before, I lookt onlie upon that, that appeared for the preſent, and now after-wit is bought, although it be dear, I ſee cauſe now to repent of what I have done.</p>
                  <p>My Brethren, Surelie Kings and Nobles are great bleſſings of God when they are good: you ſee I have not ſtrain'd in the leaſt thing, but held forth to you what the ſcope of the place is; Let none go away and ſay, that I enveighed againſt <hi>Kings,</hi> or <hi>Nobles,</hi> certainlie in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they are great bleſſings of God, and we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg it fitting to have a difference between man and man.</p>

                     <hi>not alwaies in love.</hi> I gave them a King ſaith he, but in <hi>mine anger.</hi> Gods gifts are not alwaies in love; no, they are in anger many times: Reade but the 11. of <hi>Numbers,</hi> 18. 20. you ſhall find there of God giving people their deſires. He lets them have them, but how? <hi>Say thou unto the People, Sanctifie your ſelves againſt to morrow, and ye ſhal eat fleſh, for ye have wept in the ears of the Lord, ſaying, Who ſhall give us fleſh to eat?

in denying is Merciful.</hi> It is becauſe he is angry that he gives you ſuch things as-you would have. There's the ſame in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 29, 30. and ſo on, There it appears how God gave them fleſh according to their deſires, but <hi>while the meat was in their mouths, the wrath of God came upon them.</hi> It is a moſt excellent point, if we had time a little to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it, Oh it might quiet our deſires: for that I had thought to have ſpoken to, how we might know when a Thing is given in Gods <hi>Anger,</hi> or in his <hi>Love,</hi> the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral waies of Gods giving; you may come to know whether a thing be given in Love or in Anger, by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the waies of things, and comparing one thing with another, you may come to know much of God in it.</p>

this temper of <hi>Davids</hi> heart in his affliction was the thing that did ſo much help him in enlargement to praiſe God, when he returned to the Ark and Citie again: Had <hi>David</hi> kept a ſtir, and fretting, and vexing, and what, muſt I go from the Citie of <hi>Jeruſalem!</hi> and how doth God deal with me! and I am reſolved though it coſt me my life I will return to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and take poſſeſſion of the Citie, whatſoever comes of it; perhaps <hi>David</hi> might have gotten thither, but there would not have been ſo much love of God in it, as when he could give up himſelf to Gods diſpoſe. And ſo if this people could have ſaid thus, It's true Lord, thou art our King, but we are deſpiſed becauſe we are governed by men of ſuch <note place="margin">Note.</note> mean qualitie, and the truth is, God had promiſed them a King alſo, and therefore it was not ſuch an evil thing to deſire a King, but ſo eagerly, they would have him now, if they had been but quiet, and ſaid, Lord, thou telleſt us in thy Word of a King that we ſhall have, Lord, fulfil this thy Word, and for the preſent we are content to ſubmit to thee, as long as thou thinkeſt fit; now it may be God would have given them a King, or preſently after, and ſo they might have had a holy and gracious King; but they muſt have him now, and ſo they had him with the anger of God.

                  <p>The laſt Exerciſe, there was only theſe Two or Three Obſervations named.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That God may have a hand in things wherein men do</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                     <hi>ſin exceedingly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Things that are very evil may have ſucceſs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>to the hearts of men for a time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Third thing was this; <hi>That Gods Gifts are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>in Love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now becauſe it is a great Point, there are Two things that I ſhall deſire to do</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To ſhew to you, <hi>How a man may know that what God doth give him, it is in anger and not in love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then Secondly, <hi>Some</hi> CORRALARIES <hi>to be drawn from it;</hi> but very briefly in both.</p>
                  <p>For the Firſt then, <hi>How we may come to know a thing to be given by God in anger rather than in love.</hi> It is a verie <note place="margin">It is hard to convince <hi>men</hi> when they have their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, that it is not in love.</note> hard thing to convince men, if they have their deſires ſatisfied that it is rather from anger than love; Men are ſo well pleaſed with the ſatisfying of their deſires that they can verie hardlie be convinc'd but that God intends good to them in it, and therefore you ſhall find in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 17. that God was fain to do a great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful work of his to convince this people that, that which he gave them there <hi>(Saul)</hi> it was in anger rather than in love, <hi>Is it not Wheat Harveſt to day? I will call un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, and he ſhall ſend thunder, and rain, that you may perceive and ſee that your wickedneſs is great which ye have done in the ſight of the Lord, in asking you a King. Samuel</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Chap. 8. told them of their ſin in asking a King,
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:43340:251"/>
but they would not be convinced, ſtill they muſt have a King. Now ſaith <hi>Samuel,</hi> It is Wheat Harveſt, and whereas the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> were never wont to have rain in Harveſt time, it was a ſtrange and wonderful thing for them to have rain then: But though it be Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt-time, yet it ſhall rain and thunder, and all to the end that you may be convinced of yourgreat wickedneſs in asking you a King. <hi>They had not only had their deſires granted before this time, but as they thought had ſome confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>of their deſires; for</hi> Saul <hi>had proſpered after he had been a King:</hi> but yet for all that (ſaith he) I will give you an evident demonſtration that it is not in love that you have him, but it was your great wickedneſs in ſeeking you a King. <hi>And</hi> Samuel <hi>called upon the Lord</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>and the Lord ſent thunder and rain that day.</hi> And then in verſ. 19. <hi>All the people ſaid to</hi> Samuel, <hi>Pray for thy ſervants unto the Lord thy God that we die not, for we have added unto all our ſins this evil, To ask us a King:</hi> Now we do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg it to be a very great and ſore evil indeed, though our King hath proſpered a while, yet God ſhews us now that it is an evil. And by this you may ſee that it is hard for men to be convinced when they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their hearts deſires, that it is in <hi>Anger</hi> rather than in <hi>Love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to give you ſome Notes whereby you may be hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to come to ſee, whether what you have granted by <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Notes</hi> to know whether it be <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>hatred</hi> by all that is before us. 1.</note> God according to your deſires be in anger or love.</p>
                  <p>As Firſt, <hi>When you deſire, a gift, rather than God in it;</hi> when your deſires are for the <hi>Gift</hi> rather than the <hi>Giver</hi> you can have no comfort that there's love in it. There's no man that hath to deal with another, if he knows that what he doth deſire from him, it is not out of love to him, but meerly from the love of the gift, certainly though he may give him for ſome other ends, yet he doth not give it out of love, <hi>Thoſe deſires that are not out of love, are not ſatisfied from love.</hi> Love ſatisfies no deſires that are
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:43340:251"/>
not raiſed by love, love it acts alwaies upon love. Now God knows what the ground of our deſires are, if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Gift rather than the Giver, rather than God in it, (I ſay) we can have no comfort that it is from love what we do enjoy. A gracious heart whatſoever it would have from God, yet this is the main thing in its deſires, Oh! let me have God in it, ſuch is my conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here in this world, that God appoints that I ſhall not enjoy him immediately altogether, but I ſhall enjoy him through ſuch and ſuch mercies, Oh then that I might have theſe mercies that I might enjoy him in them. Certainly any thing that thou haſt in way of ſatisfaction to theſe deſires is out of love; but when thou lookeſt no further than the Creature, thou wouldeſt have the thing but lookeſt not at God in it, thou canſt not expect the love of God to be conveyed by it. That's the firſt thing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>When our deſires are imoderate and violent, then</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>we have cauſe to ſuſpect, if God ſatisfies them, that they are not out of love, when we are in a hurry in our deſires.</hi> This was juſt the caſe of this People here; Nay, but let us have a King (ſay they,) we muſt needs have him, whatſoever comes of it, we will have him. When God doth uſe to ſatisfie the deſires of his People in his love, he doth <hi>firſt quiet their hearts,</hi> he brings their hearts into a ſweet and <note place="margin">Note.</note> bleſſed moderation; but when mens hearts are violent, that the thing they deſire they muſt have, God doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times ſay, You ſhall have it then, take it: but then he ſpeaks not in love, that's verie remarkable: The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the People in the 11. of <hi>Numbers</hi> for Quails, it's a notable Scripture to confirm our Point here, That God doth not alwaies ſatisfie in love. Reade <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 30. and ſo on, there you have the ſame ſtory recorded of their deſiring of Quails, they were mightily violent in their deſires. But that's the thing I would obſerve there, That the Lord after he had ſhewed that he did not anſwer their
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:43340:252"/>
deſires in love, but in wrath, then in verſ. 34. after the judgments of God had come upon them in the ſatisfying of their deſires, that many of them were ſlain by God; then ſaith the Text, he called the name of that place, <hi>Kibroth-Hattaavah,</hi> becauſe there they buried the people that luſted: that is, The <hi>Sepuleres of the luſts of the deſires</hi> that they had: God ſets a Brand upon that place, ſaith he, Here are the Graves of the deſirers; Oh! the deſirers, they muſt needs have fleſh, and they ſtood upon their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, their deſires muſt be ſatisfied; And here's the Graves of the deſirers ſaith God. Oh remember, you that luſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter evil things, remember when your deſires are immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and violent, it's juſt with God to ſet a brand by ſom remarkable hand of his againſt you, and ſay, <hi>Here's the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>mark of theſe deſires that were ſo immoderate, and ſo violent.</hi> That's the Second Note.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>When God grants unto men their deſires, but it is before the due time:</hi> They have what they would have, <note place="margin">3.</note> Oh! but they have it not in Gods time. Children they long and deſire after green Fruit, but if they could ſtay but a few weeks or months, one Apple then would be worth an hundred when they are green; but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſtay, they muſt have the Fruit when it is green; They have it, but it breeds Worms in their bellies and doth them no good. So when we have our deſires ſatisfied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the due time, it's not in love then. Certainly a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intends little good to her Child, though her Child ſhould cry for green Apples from off the tree, to fill the belly of her Child with thoſe green Apples, No, it's not the due time; God had promiſed that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould have <hi>a King in due time,</hi> that there ſhould come KIngs from the loins of <hi>Abraham:</hi> And in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 14. There's a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of a King, that they ſhould have; yea, but they would not ſtay Gods time, and therefore it was not out of love: in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 13. it is ſaid there, That thoſe that did ſo luſt, God gave them their luſts in his wrath,
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:43340:252"/>
                     <hi>They did not wait for his Counſel.</hi> That's that which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Note.</note> there Oh! we ſhould be willing to wait for Gods Counſel. We would have the thing preſently done: yea but Gods Counſel works one thing after another, and one thing depends upon another, and we ſhould be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to wait for his Counſel; If we will not mind Gods Counſel, but muſt have our deſires ſatisfied, and that now; we cannot expect love in them, but it's rather wrath; He gives unto them <hi>in his Anger:</hi> and that's the Third Note.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>When God grants us what we would have, but</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>there comes no bleſſing at all with what we enjoy;</hi> he doth grant the thing, but takes away the bleſſing of the thing, he takes away the comfort of it, the ſatisfaction in it, <hi>They ſhal eat, but they ſhall not be ſatisfied:</hi> So in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 15. There he gave them their requeſt, but ſent leanneſs into their ſoul, the text ſaith, <hi>He filled them according to their deſires with fleſh, but ſent leanneſs into their ſoul;</hi> the meaning of the text is this, It is a ſimilitude transfer'd from the bodie to the ſoul, that as many times men may <note place="margin">Pſa. 106. 15. Opened</note> have a dogs appetite (as the Phyſitiaus cals it) that is, a mightie greedie ſtomach, but they cannot digeſt what they eat, and ſo the body is lean; ſo here, they had a mightie deſire, but as in the bodie manie times there is ſuch a diſeaſe that the meat turns not to nouriſhment, ſo in their ſouls, they had even that their ſouls deſir'd, yea, but their ſouls could not be ſatisfied, there was that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper in the ſoul as in the bodie, the bodie doth not thrive with what it eats when it hath ſuch a diſeaſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; ſo though the ſoul hath what it did deſire for the matter of it, yet it had a diſtemper in it; thus it could not be ſatisfied, nor thrive, nor proſper with what it had, Oh he ſent leanneſs into their ſoul. How many times are men and women mightie greedie, and deſirous after ſuch and ſuch contents, and think thus, Oh how happy ſhould I be if I had this and the other thing! it
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:43340:253"/>
may be God lets you have what you would here, but when he hath let you have it, he ſnatches away the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of it; you ſhall have a Well, but it ſhall have no bottom, you ſhall not be able to get out the good and comfort in what you have. And that's the Fourth thing. Surely God is not in it, <hi>for the bleſſing of God makes rich, and ads no ſorrow with it,</hi> no, he brings comfort.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>When that which we deſire is meerly to ſatisfie our luſts,</hi> meerly that we might have our humors and luſts <note place="margin">5.</note> ſatisfied, that's all; we do not deſire ſuch and ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts that by them we may be fitted for the Service of God in our places, not ſo much becauſe we have need of them to help us in our work, but becauſe we would have our luſts ſatisfied, there's all, we cannot give an account why theſe and theſe things ſhould help us in the work of the Lord, but that we may go on as well without them: But theſe and theſe things are ſutable to our luſts: Oh! if God doth give thee any thing to ſatisfie thy luſts, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he gives it in his wrath; as now, If a man that hath a diſeaſe in his bodie, if he hath an enemie comes to him and knows what will feed his diſeaſe, the Enemie will give it him that he might diſpatch him the ſooner; there's no faithful Phyſitian, nor no loving friend will give unto any that that will feed their diſeaſe, but will take it from them, and take it from them in love, becauſe it will feed theirdiſeaſe. Oh! the Lord ſees mens hearts ſet upon ſuch and ſuch luſts, and if they have ſuch and ſuch things granted them their luſts will be fed by them, they ſhall have them ſaith God: It's as dangerous a <note place="margin">A dangerous ſign of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</note> ſign of Reprobation as any thing, to give them that, that ſhall be moſt ſutable to their luſts, that ſhall moſt harden them. And on the other ſide, The greateſt love when God ſhall take that from his children, that he knows will but feed their luſts, there's many diſeaſes are ſuch that the only way to cure them, is to keep the Patient in a ſhort dyet; though they crie for food, and be very hungry, yet
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:43340:253"/>
they muſt be kept very ſparing, why? becauſe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the diſeaſe is ſuch as will draw all nouriſhment to it ſelf to feed it: and ſo God is fain to do with his own people when he ſees them ſick of ſuch a diſeaſe, the Nature of which will draw all nouriſhment for the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>When men deſire that they would have, and are eager upon it, but they take no great care, whether they do enjoy it</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>from a reconciled God, or a provoked God,</hi> it's all one to them, let me have it; but whether it comes from God reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or God provoked, they do not much ſtand upon that: that's very remarkable here, in <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. there is this notable ſtory of Gods ſatisfying deſires in his wrath. If you turn to the beginning of the Chapter, you ſhall find that God was very much provoked with the people here: The people complain'd, it diſpleaſed the Lord, and the Lord heard it, and his anger was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the fire of the Lord burnt among them and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd them, and the people cried to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo the judgment was got off from them; but then preſently after they fell to murmuring before ever any thing was done to reconcile God and their ſouls together; you do not reade of any work of humiliation to ſeek reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God, between the time that God did manifeſt his ſore diſpleaſure againſt them, and the time that God ſatisfied them in their deſires; no, they look'd not upon that, God indeed was diſpleaſed, but it was off now, and for any matter of atonement, or making up their peace with God, that they look'd not at, but let them have their deſires, hence it came to be in wrath the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying of their deſires.</p>

And carnal hearts take no great care them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of it, let me have it whether my heart be in a fit condition, that's not the thing. It's your ſin and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs not to regard the preparation of your hearts for what you have; and it's Gods Judgment to give it to you before you be prepared. A gracious heart when it would have a mercy, it is as careful to get the heart pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the mercy, as to obtain it; Oh! there's ſuch and ſuch things that indeed would be ſutable to me, but is my heart fit for ſuch a deliverance? is my heart fit for ſuch a mercy as this? when as it is thy care to prepare thy heart; and when thou art labouring for the mercy, thou art as well labouring to prepare thy heart for it, ſurely then when it comes, it muſt be ſweet indeed; but when there's no preparation before, thou canſt not know that it is in love. <hi>We little think that we have need of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for mercies.</hi> If indeed God ſhould threaten ſome <note place="margin">Note.</note> judgment, we would think that we had need be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but certaialy there is as great need for preparation for mercies to be able to make good uſe of them, as for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions to be able to bear them. And this ſeventh Note I have likewiſe from <hi>Numb. 11. 18.

Yea, but we will have a King, and we wil all then be tied to the ſame thing, and be under the ſame power, and ſo there will be a great deal of union that way: when this man ſhall not be in this way, and the other ſhal not be in another way, and men to have their freedom thus &amp; thus, but al ſhal come in and joyn under the ſame Law, and ſo we ſhall go on in one: Certainly this was their reaſoning in their deſire of having a King. Now this kind of union (no queſtion) was verie good among the People; but to have it in this way, That whereas the People were governed in ſuch a way before as ſtood with a great deal of Libertie; It's true, they ſhall have a kind of union, but they do not conſider what inconveniences there will be in their being thus chain'd together.

                     </note> you have ſuch a kind of union, to be united with ſuch chains? Conſider that with the union there may come a ſlavery upon you. But they did not conſider of any ſuch things, no matter ſay they, Come, let us be all joyn'd in one, and let the ſame Law be upon every one. But now, how this would bring them under bondage and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very in thoſe things they would be loth to be brought under in, in that they conſidered not at all.</p>

that God doth it out of love, when it is out of a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſpirit that loves novelty. They, though they had bin long enough under that kind of Government, and in a meer kind of novelty, not knowing what might come of ſuch a change, but a change they would have. And ſo people though there be never ſo much good in a way, yet out of a novelty they would fain have a change: And if God grant them a change when they have no other ground but that for it, it is a ſign that there is wrath in it, and not love.</p>
                  <p>Further, <hi>When it is through impatiency, and want of heart to ſubmit to God in a former condition.</hi> It's ill when it is <note place="margin">15.</note> through a meer novelty, but when it's through impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency then it's like to be in wrath, and not in mercy, if your condition be changed, God hath put you in a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and mean condition, it's true, it's lawful for you to deſire a change, yea, but if you deſire it becauſe you cannot ſubmit to Gods hand, then it's a ſign that it is in wrath, but when you have brought your hearts to this, Lord here I am, diſpoſe of me as thou pleaſeſt, I am content to lie under thy hand, but Lord, I look up to thee for mercy; Conſider I am a poor weak Creature, and it is fit that thou ſhouldeſt have thy will, and not I mine: then if God make a change, you may have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that it is in mercy: but if you have it through im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiencie, you can have no comfort at all in it. It was juſt ſo here, they could not bear the hand of God that was upon them, any preſent trouble that they had upon them, and ſo thought to help themſelves by having a King, and God gave them one, but it was in his anger.</p>
                  <p>Further, <hi>When our deſires of further mercies makes us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the former mercies,</hi> and makes us unthankful for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <note place="margin">16</note> mercies; they would have a King that might go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and fight for them.

<pb n="553" facs="tcp:43340:257"/>
when they had <hi>Samuel</hi> to direct them, they never had more glorious Victories afterwards than then: Nay, you ſhall find in the whol Story of the Judges, that they did alwaies prevail, and their Judges general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were good, and guided them in Gods waies; but the Kings did not ſo; <hi>For the Kings of Iſrael were none of them good, from the beginning of them to the end.</hi> Oh unthankful <note place="margin">Note.</note> wretches that they are, ſo eager to have another condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, never minding nor bleſſing God for what they had, forgetful of all the good that ever they had. <hi>Samuel</hi> could appeal to them, <hi>Whoſe Ox, or Aſs have I taken?</hi> he judged righteouſly in his judgment. But they forget all Gods goodneſs and mercy towards them, and muſt now be in another condition. Oh! conſider of this you that deſire new conditions, be not you unthankful for what you have had, if you be ſo eager to have more ſo as to forget what you have had, if God ſhould ſend you more your caſe is like to be worſe than now it is: If one ſhould go and take meat to eat befor he hath dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted what he eat before, he hath fill'd his ſtomach, but there comes new diſhes to the Table that pleaſes his pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and he falls upon that and eats more and more, but that doth not nouriſh him, but turns to evil humors <note place="margin">Simile.</note> and ſo doth him hurt; but if he would ſtay till he hath digeſted what he hath eaten before, then he might eat and have good nouriſhment. And you that would fain have more and more, have you digeſted what you have had? are you thankful for what you have had? hath God had the glory of what you have had before? then if God gives you any thing you may have comfort to your ſouls that it comes out of love.</p>

                     <hi>thou haſt thy deſires ſatisfied</hi> Me thinks this Point might be as a prick, to prick the bladders of the pride of mens hearts. Oh! take heed though you have proſpered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your deſires; <hi>Saul</hi> proſpered a great while, and yet it was in wrath. Certainly there's no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:43340:259"/>
to be expected from ſuch things as we may have in Gods wrath, and therefore no cauſe to be exalted.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Learn from hence, <hi>Never to draw any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>of Gods love, by ſatisfying your deſires in outward things.</hi> It is a vain conceit of people to think thus, God loves me, why? becauſe I have deſired ſuch and ſuch things, and God hath given them to me. If a man were to go and chuſe a Wife, if he knew her face were painted, would <note place="margin">Simile</note> he conclude, Surely here's one of an excellent complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? No, he would rather ſuſpect it; truly the argument is as good, That this womans complexion and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of her body is whole and good, as that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that my condition is good becauſe God ſatisfies me in my deſires.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, draw this conſequence likewiſe, <hi>Learn never to envie at any men that have their luſts ſatisfied;</hi> there's lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <note place="margin">5.</note> cauſe that you ſhould envie them. If you ſhould ſee a man that loves Wine, and you knew it were poiſoned. <note place="margin">Similies.</note> And a man that hath a Sattin Sute, and you know it hath <note place="margin">1. 2.</note> the Plague in it, there were no cauſe of envying ſuch a man; a Leather Sute were a great deal better. God ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies men many times, but it is in wrath, and to prepare them for ſlaughter.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Learn from hence, <hi>To be content to wait, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>to be denied of your deſires.</hi> Oh! this is a point of verie great uſe, to teach us patience when God denies us; be patient and content when God denies you your deſires, for you do not know what God may aim at in it.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Learn from hence, <hi>Not to reſt in what you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">7</note> 
                     <hi>but to ſeek to know the principle from whence it comes.</hi> And this I take to be as ſpecial a difference between a Carnal heart, and a Gracious heart as any I know. A Carnal <note place="margin">A ſpecial dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal &amp; a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart.</note> heart thinks this: If I have the thing, I care not for any more: but a Gracious heart looks at the principle from whence it comes, he loves to look at the root and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of all. A Gardener that oweth the Flowers regards
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:43340:259"/>
the root more than the flower a great deal: but a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <note place="margin">Simile.</note> is mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e pleaſed with the Flower than with the Root. So Carnal hearts look only at Flowers; but gracious hearts look at the Root: I have ſuch and ſuch a thing, but have I an evidence of Gods love? Look how high the head of the Fountain is, ſo high the Water will go, and no higher; Water will aſcend as high as the place was from whence it did deſcend. And ſo everie mercie we have wil carry us as high as from whence it came: If <note place="margin">Note.</note> from common general bounty, it carries us to God but it came in a general way; but if it comes in a ſpecial love in Chriſt, it carries us to God in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, Learn hence, <hi>To ſeek thoſe gifts that God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">8.</note> 
                     <hi>grants to any but in love.</hi> There are ſome things that are of ſuch a noble and excellent nature, as God doth never grant to any but in love, they are precious things indeed; And this one Conſideration doth ſhew the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference <note place="margin">An eſſential difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual &amp; Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</note> between Spiritual bleſſings, and Temporal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings as much as any one thing I know. Temporal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings though they are in themſelves good, and have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſweet accomodations with them, yet they are of ſuch a low nature, as many times they come to men, and come out of Gods wrath, they may ſtand with wrath, yea, they may flow from wrath. But come to Spiritual bleſſings, the Graces of Gods Spirit, come to thoſe Spiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings wherewith we are bleſt in Jeſus Chriſt, and theſe are of ſuch a nature as they can never com but from love, and out of love.</p>
                  <p>From this point you ſee, That <hi>a little Grace is more worth than the enjoyment of all the world:</hi> God may give a man <note place="margin">Note.</note> the Empire of all the world, and he may do it in wrath, and tend to the furtherance of wrath; but now, if you have but the leaſt drachm of Grace, if you have but any ſpiritual knowledge of God in Chriſt; <hi>This is eternal life,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 17. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>to know thee, and thy Son whom thou haſt ſent into the world:</hi> If thou, haſt any Faith, Oh! this is <hi>Precious Faith:</hi> If

thou haſt any knowledg, Oh it's the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> it comes from the infinite Ocean of eternal love and will carry thee to the infinite Ocian of love; Oh! prize Grace, and ſeek after Grace.</p>
                  <p>You whoſe hearts have been ſo eager and deſirous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">The point urged.</note> outward things, turn now the ſtream of your deſires; Oh I have been eager after ſuch and ſuch things; if I have them, yet I may have the wrath of God with them and what good will they do me then? Oh! but I hear that there are ſuch and ſuch things to be had that I can never have them but in love, they are the priviledges that come to the Saints in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, <hi>Oh bleſs God, you that know and find that what you have, it is in love.</hi> You are to bleſs God for what <note place="margin">9.</note> you have; but in that he hath given you your deſires, and given them out of love too, here God bleſſes his bleſſings, and your bleſſings ſhould be double, trible, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, an hundred fold: Oh that the Lord hath delivered me from ſuch an affliction, and I find it is in love; as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> could ſay, when he was delivered from his ſickneſs, <hi>In love to my ſoul haſt thou delivered me from the pit</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 39.</note> 
                     <hi>of corruption:</hi> So I make no queſtion but there's many of the people of God, even many of you that are before him this day, that are able to ſay, Well, upon theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that I have heard this day upon this point thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, I can ſay to the glory of God, Out of love to my ſoul hath he delivered me out of ſuch an affliction, from ſuch a ſickneſs; out of love to my ſoul hath he granted me ſuch a mercy: I had been praying and crying to him for ſuch and ſuch mercies, and out of love to my ſoul hath he granted them to me. Oh! you may go away <note place="margin">Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> with comfort in what you have, if it be but a very little that God hath given you; Oh the Lord hath given you a good portion, your lot is fallen into a good ground, you have a goodlie inheritance, Certainlie you have a childs portion, and go away and be ſatisfied in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="559" facs="tcp:43340:260"/>
And now my Brethren, though this part for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical part of it is the chief: I confeſs I have not yet come upon that that is held forth in the verie words, and that is about giving of Governors in his wrath; I only have ſpoken to the Point hitherto, as it concerns the giving of our deſires whatſoever it be: But now for the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, as the ſpecification of their deſires, <hi>That God had given them a King in his wrath.</hi> That I confeſs is a point that I think there may be much of the mind of God known in it, and a point that will require ſome time in opening it. And it will be hard to ſpeak of ſuch a point as this is without very great deliberation, and to have full ſcope when at any time I ſpeak of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do not intend at this time to meddle with this point of Gods giving Kings in wrath, I ſhall rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to the next day. Only one Note further, and that's this;</p>
                  <p>A hint of a meditation upon Gods giving our deſires in his wrath; when men by the violence and ſtrength of their ſpirits do get their deſires from God though in wrath, it hath hinted to me this Meditation which may be of very great uſe to you.</p>
                  <p>Many men they do get from their conſciences thoſe things they have a mind to have, as they get from God that they have a mind to have; many men are very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in their deſires, and would fain have God grant them ſuch and ſuch things, at length, though it be a thing that is very diſpleaſing to God, ſaith God, let them have it. Juſt ſo it is in regard of conſcience, <hi>for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is Gods Vice-gerent in the ſoul of man.</hi> Now there are many men that are verie deſirons of ſuch things as their conſciences at firſt are very much againſt: Oh! they would fain have ſuch and ſuch things: ſaith conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, you may not, you will ſin againſt God, you will would me, and bring ſorrow and affliction to your ſelves; this makes them at a ſtand, and they are very
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:43340:261"/>
much griev'd at it that conſcience will not give them leave, and it may be they have ſo much enlightening in their conſciences as they dare not take it without the leave of conſcience, and although they may reſtrain for a while, yet ſtill their luſts are very violent, and they would fain have their conſciences to yeeld to them, they labor and ſtruggle what they can with conſcience, and they ſeek to find out ſome evaſions and diſtinctions whereby they may ſatisfie conſcience, either to lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience aſleep, ſo that it may not trouble them, or at length to ſatisfie conſcience ſo far as conſcience may be content that they ſhould have their deſires ſatisfied, <hi>Now their luſts when they are grown hot ſend up ſuch ſtreams into their underſtandings as hinders the work of conſcience,</hi> that <note place="margin">Note.</note> conſcience begins to be more dull in the work of it, and is not ſo quick in the apprehenſions of it, nor in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of it as before; and at length after much ado, when they have tir'd and wearied themſelves, and tired conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they at length do obtain <hi>even of their very conſciences</hi> to do ſuch things as they have a mind to, ſo that now <note place="margin">Note.</note> their conſciences begins to ſay to them, <hi>Seeing you have ſuch a ſtrong and earneſt deſire, do it;</hi> Now upon this they eagerly fall upon it, and they bleſs themſelves in this, and think they have gotten a great Victorie that they have prevail'd over their conſciences, that their conſciences hath given them leave to do ſuch a thing; it may be theſe men will ſay, If I thought it were againſt conſcience, if conſcience did tell me that it ought not to be done, I would not do it for a world. Yea, but friend, how do you get leave of your conſcience to do it? There was a time that conſcience was againſt it; how came you to get leave of your conſcience? was it not through the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of your ſpirits? <hi>You would needs have it,</hi> you were ſet upon it that you muſt have <hi>your liberty, and preterment, your eaſe, and content,</hi> and you muſt not ſuffer ſuch &amp; ſuch things, and by this violence of your ſpirits you come to
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:43340:261"/>
prevail with your conſciences: Now conſcience lets you go one but do not you think that conſcience will tear you for this another day: for all you have prevail'd with your conſcience ſo as it doth not acuſe you of ſuch and ſuch an evil way, but lets you go on; do not you think to hear of it another day? Oh yes, certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience being Gods Vice-gerent, will do as God will do in this caſe, When men get their deſires of God, why ſaith God, let them have them, but do not you think that God will call them to an account for it? So it is here; as men ſhall hereafter pay full dearly for thoſe things that God ſuffers them here to have; ſo many men and women will pay full dearly for thoſe things that conſcience gives them now libertie to enjoy: though you have libertie yet you have got it in a forced way from conſcience, and conſcience will have another rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning with you hereafter: you know how it was with <hi>Balaam,</hi> he had a mind to go to curſe the people, it was becauſe of his <hi>preferment,</hi> and though God did deny him once, yet he would ask again, and he would not be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied till God ſaid at length, Go; Yea, but God met him in the way, and had like to have deſtroyed him for all that. Juſt ſo do many men with their conſciences, it may be they ſee ſome preferment that they may get ſuch a way, and their conſciences for the preſent have ſome tenderneſs, but they will ask their conſciences, and their conſciences ſaies no, but then they will ask again, and again, and, as I ſay, God ſaid to <hi>Balaam</hi> at length, Go, but he ſaid it to him in anger, and met him in the way and had like to have deſtroyed him; and ſo though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may do ſo, yet conſcience will one day come out with a drawn Sword againſt thee, and it may be thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THE Author was prevented by ſeveral providences, from preaching the fore going</hi> Sermon <hi>for ſome months toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, inſomuch as himſelf wondred what purpoſe God had in it; till at laſt God viſited him by ſickneſs, whereof he fell on ſleep in the Lord: His Diſeaſe was thought to be Infection, but without any</hi> ſore, <hi>yea, and (as the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man his wife hath related) without any ſpots or</hi> tokens; <hi>only there was a black ſetling of blood on one ſide of his back, which ſhe ſuppoſed might have come with a Fall from a Horſe which he had taken not long before. This is mentioned by occaſion of ſome contrary reports concerning his death. About the time of his imediate diſſolution be lift up his eyes, and was heard to ſpeak theſe words,</hi> I come, I come, I come: <hi>and ſo gave up the ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It had been much to be wiſhed that the Author had been more conciſe &amp; brief in ſom Amplifications which, though they were al exceeding uſeful, yet they have deprived us of his Preaching and compleating both the former Sermon, and the reſt of the Propheſie. But God was pleaſed (for our ſin no doubt) to deprive us of that</hi> Mediator like Inſtrument <hi>between the divided Godly Parties of this Nation, and of the further mind of the Holy-Ghoſt which be had revealed to this his Servant, touching the Scope and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of this Propheſie in theſe daies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
