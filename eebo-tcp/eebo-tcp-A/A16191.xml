            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the gentle Reader, in the commendation of Fables.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I reuolued in my minde the ſundrie kindes of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which for the profit of Man haue put in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance their imaginations, they that haue writ Fables are to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the reſte: for they haue not onely wonderfully delighted the harts of men, but alſo haue more allured them to doe thinges both good and profitable with their Fables, than Philoſophers with their preceptes. For they with ſuch a ſweetneſſe do ſo pierce the hartes of the Readers, and by ſimilitudes do declare (whiche are of much force to moue affection) what men ought to take, and what to refuſe, that thereby they are compelled, againſt their wils to agree vnto them. For the minde is diſdaynfull to heare, neyther will it eaſely abyde things profitable and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, excepte they bee poudered with ſome merry ieſte Hereunto beareth witneſſe a certein Orator of <hi>Athens,</hi> who on a tyme ſpeaking to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued them leſſe attentiue, required them
<pb facs="tcp:9538:6"/>
that they would vouchſafe to heare a Fable: they were contented: then he began thus: Ceres, the Swallowe and the Egle ſometime iorneyed togither, when they were come to a riuer, the Swallowe flue ouer, and the Eele ſwam through the riuer: when he hadde ſo ſayd he held his peace, then they aſked him what Ceres didde? Your Gods (quod he) are offended at you whiche will not heare them that counſell you for your profit, but if they tell any tales ye heare them willingly. What force fables are of to moue affection, I could declare by many examples, yet will I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound but three. The inhabitants of <hi>Samos</hi> would haue put their ruler to death, whome <hi>Aeſope</hi> diſſuaded ſaying: As a Foxe paſſed ouer a riuer, he was driuen into a ditch wher he ſtucke ſo faſt in the mudde, that he could not eſcape, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the flies ſtinged: the Hedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hog ſeing him there, moued with compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, aſked him if he ſhoulde driue the flies from him. No (quod he) for theſe are full with my bloud and can litle trouble me, but if thou ſhouldeſt dryue them away, other hunger ſterued flies wil occupie their romes, and ſuck out all the bloud that is left within me. The like shall happen to you O <hi>Sami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:9538:7"/>
for if ye ſlaye your Ruler whiche is ſo wealthie, ye muſt needes choſe others, which whiles they enriche them ſelues, shall poll you of all that this man hath left: wherwith all the <hi>Samians</hi> being moued, left off their purpoſe. By the like meanes was <hi>Tiberius Caeſar</hi> perſuaded, when he appointed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day Magiſtrates, wherevpon (as <hi>Ioſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> telleth) the Countrey of <hi>Iurie</hi> was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by <hi>Cratus</hi> and <hi>Pilatus</hi> onely by the ſpace of twentie yeares. For (as <hi>Statius</hi> ſaith) he that ruleth but a litle while, sheweth ſmal fauour to the people. The <hi>Himerians</hi> ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time minded to choſe Captaine of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie <hi>Phalaris</hi> the tyrant of <hi>Agrigentum,</hi> whome <hi>Steſichorus</hi> the Poet with this Fable diſcouraged from their purpoſe, ſaying: A horſe fed alone in a medow, at length came a Harte thither and ſpoyled it: wherevpon the Horſe tooke the aduiſe of man, by what meane he might be reuenged, to whome the man ſayde: If thou wilt take a bytte in thy mouth and ſuffer me armed to gette vpon thy backe, whoſe counſell he followed, and by his helpe put the Harte to flight and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the conquerer, but from that tyme forth he could not rid his mouth from the
<pb facs="tcp:9538:7"/>
byt nor the man from his backe. Euen ſo (ſayde <hi>Steſichorus)</hi> the like shall happen to you, if ye choſe <hi>Phalaris</hi> your captayne, for your enimies ye shall ſubdue, but ye shall be in bondage to this Tyraunt for euer: with which wordes the <hi>Himerians</hi> being diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, forſoke the counſell to choſe ſuche a Captayne, what time the people of <hi>Rome</hi> ſeparated themſelues from the Senators, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they payd tribute and were combred with warfares, did not <hi>Agrippa Menenius</hi> turne them from their purpoſe with this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Sometime (quoth he) ye <hi>Romaines,</hi> the members of man perceyuing the belly to be ſlouthfull, fell at variance with her and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to giue her no longer any ſuccor. It happened, that, bicauſe they denied her nouriſhment, they became faynt, whervpon they were at one againe. In like maner the Senate and people of <hi>Rome</hi> are as the belly and members, whiche neede one of anothers helpe, and as by diſcord they perishe, ſo by concord they are of ſtrength: By whiche Tale the people turned from their purpoſe and became friends again with the Senate. Therfore not without good cauſe both the Greeke and Latin Poets, as <hi>Heſiodus</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:9538:8"/>
               <hi>Horace,</hi> haue mingled ſuch Fables amongſt their workes, and alſo the chiefeſt and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Philoſophers, as <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Plutarche,</hi> with many moe, haue highly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them, whoſe opinion was, that they much auayled to the inſtruction of a moral and ciuill lyfe: wherefore <hi>Leouicenus</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alla,</hi> of late writers the beſt lerned, did tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate Fables out of Greke into Latin, which they knew would be to their prayſe, and to the delight and profite of others: Neyther were they deceyued, for they are dayly redde of moſt learned men. I can not therefore perceyue, why by tranſlating theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, I should be defrauded of the prayſe due to me, whiche other haue had, excepte we be ſo ſpitefull, that to vs that is not lawful, which with great commendation to the Grecians and Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtes is allowed.

            <head>¶ The firſte Fable, of the Penance of the Wolfe, the Foxe, and the Aſle.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Wolfe, the Foxe, and <note place="margin">Abuſe of the ſimple.</note> the Aſſe ſometyme iournied togyther towardes <hi>Rome,</hi> to obtayne remiſſion of theyr ſinnes: In the way (bycauſe they thought the Pope woulde be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe occupied, that he might not intende them) they agréed to be ſhriuen one of an other, and to ſuffer Penance at their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. The Wolfe therfore made hys confeſſion to the Foxe in this manner: That he ſawe a ſowe which had .xij. pigs, the which walked alone in the fields, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in fatneſſe, and ſuffered hir pigs at home to ſtarue: wherfore he deuoured the ſowe, bycauſe of hir heynous offence in forſaking hir yong ones: and after, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moued to pitie, he killed alſo the pigs, to ridde them out of their payne, and eate them vp: This he tolde with teares, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to know what penance he ſhoulde doo therfore. In fayth (quod the Foxe) thy
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:9538:9"/>
fault is not great, ſay once a <hi>Pater noſter</hi> and then thou ſhalt be pardoned. Straight after, the Foxe began his confeſſion thus: A countryman had a Cocke of the game, which bet and vanquiſhed all other cocks néere about, who with his ſhril crowing, troubled in euery quarter, not onely the hole, but alſo the ſicke perſons, eſpecially thoſe which had the headake, whoſe pride I could not well away with: as I founde him therfore on a tyme abroade with the hens, I caught him, and caried him awaye to my hole, where I deuoured him: for which déed the Hens kackled againſt me, &amp; troubled me with their crying: I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to reuenge the iniurie done vnto me, tore manye of them in pieces and eate them: herein I confeſſe that I offended, therfore I require pardon. Herevnto the Wolfe ſayd: Thou didſt well in qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the noyſe and pride of the Cocke and Hens, and therfore it is but a ſmall fault, yet will I ioyne thée thys penance, That the thrée frydayes following, thou eate no fleſhe, if thou canſt get none: for I wil ſhewe thée as much fauoure, as thou didſt to mée. Well nowe Sir ſayde they to the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9538:9"/>
Aſſe, let vs heare thy confeſſion, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan thus: My moyling &amp; drudgery which I endure, is not vnknowen to you my Lords, as in carying of corne ſacks, ſtone, woode and water, yet once I offended, whereof I repented me ful oft: For a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt of my Lordes, apointed ruler ouer me, being once a cold, a ſtrawe appeared oute of hys ſhoo, whiche I ſnatched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from hym, whereby he tooke greate harme and colde of his féete. Therfore be mercifull vnto me, and ioyne me ſome penance. But they ſayd, what haſte thou done thou thefe? Mary fye on thée, by thy meanes that ſeruant had ſuch hurte of his féete, that we thinke he is dead thereof, whereby thy ſoule is damned, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy bodye ought not to eſcape ſcotte frée, then they killed and deuoured him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Morall.</hi> The mighty and riche men in lyke maner do pardon one another, but to the poore they are harde harted and inexorable.</p>

abroade for diſport: whom the Goute met, and accompanied as faſt as he could, though it were with muche payne: when that dayes iourney was nigh at a pointe, they approched neere to a little town cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Tuche,</hi> where they determined to ſéeke fit lodging for their purpoſe. The Spider tooke litle héede but turned into the houſe of an excéeding riche man, where on eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſide he ſet vp his ſtreamers. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were ſtraight at hande, thoſe lyke Diuels in a playe, which caſt downe his webs, and as faſt as he ſet them vp in any parte of the houſe, they were ſwept downe: he coulde not worke ſo cloſely, but it was founde out, ſuch was his miſerie, that in a houſe of ſo much wealth and abundance, he only wanted and was thruſt downe. But the Goute went like a begger, (whiche cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to be the longer without lodging) at length he gotte him to the cottage of a poore man, where when he had layde him downe to reſte, it is not to be tolde what miſerie he endured: his ſupper was coorſe bread, and a Cup of cold water to drinke, when he was drye: hys bed to reſté hys wéerie bones vppon, was a harde boorde
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9538:10"/>
ſtrewed without either boughs or graſſe, but thinly with a litle ſtrawe. I need not ſhewe, how ill agréed ſo harde a bed and ſo rude an hoſte, to ſo tender limbes, and to his ſkin as ſoft as ſilke. When the day ſtarre was ſcarſe riſen, the Goute and the Spider mette againe. Then the Spider firſt declared his nights yll reſte, and how ofte he ſhifted his place: ſomtime vpbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Maiſter with too much niceneſſe, ſometyme with the double dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the ſwéepers. Ah (quod the Goute) the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie of myne hoſte is incredible: for if I had leiſure, I could ſhew thee ſpots both black and blew, that my bed as harde as the Adamant, hath imprinted in my ſofte ſkin. Then they tooke counſaile thus once agayn, That the Spider ſhould goo to the poore mans cottage, and the Goute to the riche mans houſe, wherevnto they bothe agréed. When it waxed darke, they came neere to a Citie, and the Goute remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring well hys appointment, faire and ſoftly went into an excéeding riche mans houſe, where he hid him ſelf: whom when the Maiſter had ſcarſe ſée ne, Ieſu GOD, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what harty good will, what kindneſſe,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9538:11"/>
and with what names dyd he entertayne him: ſtraightway, he was layde vppon beds of Doune, hys bolſters ſtuffed with ſoft partriche feathers.
