         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Dr. <hi>Alſtede</hi> was a man of vaſt comprehenſion, but had many Irons in the fire; Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> I leave to Dr. <hi>Coopers</hi> judgement, who ſayes that pretending to give us a Revelation of the Revelation hee hath ſet forth an Obſcuration thereof. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> was my worthy and learned friend, but not to bee preferred before truth. Mr. <hi>Archer</hi> was held to bee a pious and good Chriſtian: if hee bee not the Author of the Book in his name, let him beare the blame that fathered it upon

Yet by Chriſts caſting out Devils out of many perſons poſſeſſed, by his conqueſt over Satan at his death, by his giving his Diſciples pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to tread on Serpents and Scorpions and power over the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, it clearely appeares, that <hi>the kingdome, power and glory</hi> (as the Church confeſſes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. &amp; 5.) is truly his: and that <hi>hee is King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Rev:</hi> 19.16.

               <p>This Kingdome Chriſt began to expreſſe and make known, while hee lived here on earth.

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Princes upon, or preſently after their being declared to be annointed Princes begin their Kingdome. Scripture and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience confirm this.</p>
               <p>But it was declared, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt was the Meſſias, the annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prince, before the end of the ſeventy weeks, Dan.</hi> 9.24, 25, 26. which no Expoſitor extends further then the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that was one thouſand five hundred yeares agon.</p>
               <p>Therefore Jeſus Chriſt began his Kingdome before the end of the ſeventy weeks, one thouſand five hundred yeares agon:and is not now to begin it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. No good and lawfull King ſends out his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and requires them to bee obeyed, before hee hath begun his Kingdome.</p>

               <p>That their judgement is ſound and good, and that the <hi>Romans</hi> bee not the fourth Kingdome in <hi>Daniel,</hi> I thus prove:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 1. The fourth Kingdome in <hi>Daniel</hi> was to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before God gave Chriſt the great and moſt eminent, and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kingdome and Dominion, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.11, 13, 14, &amp; 27.</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:112936:7"/>
               <p>Therefore the Roman Kingdome is not the fourth Kingdom in <hi>Daniel.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. <hi>The fourth Kingdome in</hi> Daniel <hi>is to bee deſtroyed before Chriſts Kingdome, to which all Nations,</hi> (and not the Jews one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) <hi>are to ſubmit, Dan.</hi> 7.14. not before a Kingdome of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares (as ſome conceit yet to come) begins.</p>

               <p>Therefore at Chriſts being here on earth, or neere unto that time, he had an abſolute and boundleſſe Soveraignty farre above all Monarchs and Kings that heretofore lived, or ever ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>For though many of them had very large Dominions, and great proſperity both in Peace and Warre, and ſubdued and vaſſalled many other Kings to their Scepters: yet none of them had all power in heaven and earth committed into their hands by God.

Kings ſend their Edicts to the utmoſt parts of their Dominions: but Chriſt to all parts of Heaven and Earth. Kings command their Officers, and have them reſponſable for their ſervices: but Kings themſelves are Chriſts Vicegerents, and muſt bee countable to him for all. Chriſts laws are moſt heavenly, moſt perfect, far ſurpaſſing all humane inventions. The honours that any one receives from his King, are but mean and momentary in regard of the honours, which God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> gives. Kings can puniſh the bodies of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with priſon and death; but God can caſt both their ſoules and bodies into the lake of fire and brimſton. Kings ſtand in need, and make uſe of their Subjects help and adviſe: but Chriſt nor needs, nor will uſe his ſubjects counſel; and will uſe, though hee needs not, their ſervices. VVhat ſhould I ſay more? Chriſt in all things doth <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:112936:11"/>all that can be ſpoken, or conceived of them. So great then is the glory and Majeſty of Chriſt, that the Moon may bee abaſhed, and the Sun aſhamed (take the ſpeech literally, or elſe figuratively for Princes, and ſuch as they lend their light unto) when Chriſt raigns on mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and ſhews his power to bee above all created might whatſoever. The Sun never ſaw any King doe ſuch wonderfull workes as Chriſt here on Earth did effect. If ſome ſubject bee ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of a Kings Majeſty and eminency, it is becauſe his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hath not acceſſe to the Court, nor converſe with ſuch as can inform him: but a good chriſtian cannot but know Chriſts kingly glory and highneſſe. For though hee cannot approach that light and Majeſty, in which Chriſt now is: yet may hee ſearch the Scriptures, which in excellent manner diſcover the ſame, ſo far as it pleaſed the holy Spirit to deſcribe them, or is needfull for us to know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But Chriſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>My Kingdome is not of this World.</hi> Therefore there was ſome power and royalty, which was either denyed Chriſt, or which hee would not take upon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> A Kingdome may bee ſaid to bee of this world in two reſpects: Firſt, becauſe the adminiſtration of it is by humane and worldly means, and tends to worldly ends; as, namely, to get a large extent of wordly Dominion, a glorious name among men, abundance of earthly matters, and there is terminated. In this ſenſe, not <hi>Chriſts,</hi> but <hi>Alexanders</hi> and the <hi>Caeſars</hi> kingdoms were of this world. Secondly, becauſe it is ſo adminiſtred, that Men converſing in this world may thereby take notice of Chriſt, uſe the things of this world in an heavenly manner, have on earth a converſation as it were in Heaven, each man in his ſeverall calling and place of worldly employment ſerve God, and advance his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of grace in this world, and ſo ſubmit themſelves to Chriſts go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment here, that they may bee heires of glory in a better world. Such a kingdom Chriſt both had, and hath, in, and over this world; ſuch a kingdom hee affirmed himſelf to bee born unto. And as Chriſt governs this world and all things therein <hi>in ordine ad c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Replicat.</hi> But <hi>when the people would have made Chriſt a King, hee did not aſſent thereunto, but went from among them, Joh. 9.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The people there, out of a ſudden apprehenſion of Chriſts power, who miraculouſly fed many thouſands with five barly loaves and two fiſhes, were not fit inſtruments; nor had a calling to fit them, for conferring on Chriſt ſo great a dignity. <hi>Scinditur incertum ſtudia in contrariavulgus,</hi> is a true and cleare ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict upon them, as the ſchiſm, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.19. plainly ſhews; they which to-day would make Chriſt a King, will to morrow depoſe him: if not they, ſome others in a like, but contrary heat, upon ſome ſleight diſtaſte will doe it. Their <hi>Hoſanna</hi> one day, their <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifige</hi> ſoon after ſhew the mutability of their fancy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, had Chriſt accepted of the kingdom at theſe few Jews in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, this might have been an occaſion of a grievous combuſtion in that ſeditious and diſcontented people; becauſe the chief Rulers of the Jews conſented not thereunto, and had much people blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly led by them. If the chiefe builders refuſed the head corner ſtone, and ſaid, <hi>Wee will not have this man rule over us :</hi> and further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, ſaying, <hi>Come this is the heire, let us kill him:</hi> Chriſt, who well knew Gods law for the government of that people, would not bee made King, unleſſe hee was orderly called thereunto by the chief Elders and Rulers of their Tribes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt did not deny, or publikely gainſay his being made a King, but perceiving their intention to take him, and make him a king, hee withdrew himſelf, and thereby both avoided civill diſſention, to which that people were too too prone, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued alſo his humble courſe of life, that as a Lamb hee might come to the ſlaughter and die for us. Hee well knew the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for his humiliation; and waited his Fathers good pleaſure for his exaltation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when hee was ſet as a king upon the holy hill of <hi>Sion,</hi> his purpoſe was to propagate his kingdom by other cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, then ſuited with theſe peoples plots and deviſes: <hi>Their thoughts and wayes, were not Chriſts thoughts and wayes:</hi> For his mind was to demonſtrate his glorious might and Sovereignty, and his Infinite and all-ſeeing wiſdome by means in the worlds eye and humane e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem moſt unlikely. This in his good time he accordingly pefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:112936:12"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object. The Saints are ſaid,</hi> Apoc. 20 <hi>to raign with Chriſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and yeeres ;</hi> this is not yet fulfilled. Therefore there ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after a thouſand yeeres of Chriſts raign, in which the Saints ſhall raign with him on earth. For their raign with him in Heaven is everlaſting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Obſrve well, that 'tis no where ſaid, that Chriſts raign on kingdom is of a thouſand yeares continuance. His kingdom fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.14. begun long ſince, and continues for ever: hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer reverſed his command of teaching all Nations. Ever ſince that edict, people of all Nations and languages have been called to Chriſtianity, ſhewed their faith by their practiſe, and ſealed their Teſtimony (ſuch as have been called thereunto) by their deaths.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the ſpace of a thouſand years after Chriſts time, many were called in ſeverall Nrtions, and in every part of that thouſand yeeres, many lived and raigned with Chriſt, and <hi>the true doctrine of the Goſpel was held in ſome good meaſure untill neare the end of the thouſand yeeres: at which time there was a declining,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fox Mart.

So that ſoon after theſe wicked beginnings, error and ſuperſtition ſpread very much in the Churches proceedings.</p>

Their <hi>reigning with Chriſt</hi> imports more then when it is ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt reigns in or with them.</hi> This their reigning with Chriſt hath never yet been performed.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hereafter he muſt ſo come, and they reign with him. <hi>Archer.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There is nothing ſpoken, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20. which may aſſure us, or indeed give us any the leaſt warrant of Chriſts perſonall and viſible comming again to reign here on earth.

That hee then did perform, and in the ſame manner (which is there meant) he will ever do it to the laſt day. Theſe ſpeeches and the like put together would ſoonerafford (which indeed they do not) a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall preſence of Chriſt ſtill on earth, then any ſpeech, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>And, 2. where tis ſaid, <hi>The Saints reign with Chriſt on earth,</hi> how can that be more emphaticall, and imply more then this, <hi>Wee ſhall ſuffer with Chriſt? Rom</hi> 8.19. No man ever hence inferred that <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt again come down from Heaven, that wee may ſuffer with him. In both ſpeeches of <hi>reigning with,</hi> and <hi>ſuffering with</hi> Chriſt, Chriſt is the chief, men are his members, and partake with him their head in both. Sometimes the frame of the like expreſſions is different. As thus, <hi>Cornelius beleeved with his whole houſe, Act.</hi> 10.2. even here <hi>Cornelius</hi> is the chief ; ſo had hee been, had it been ſaid, <hi>The whole houſhold beleeved with him.</hi> And what can there bee more in this ſpeech, <hi>Wee work together with Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.4. then in this, <hi>Chriſt works together with us? Mar.</hi> 16.2. Chriſt is the chief in both. Let us not gull our ſelves with niceties, and wreſt that from Texts, which was never intended. <hi>Wee ſuffer, wee co-worke with</hi> Chriſt. and both theſe wee doe on earth: but may not hence conclude, that Chriſt comes down to us perſonally and viſibly for that purpoſe So neither can wee conclude Chriſts viſible and perſonall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:112936:13"/>on earth, becauſe it is ſaid, that <hi>we on Earth ſhall reign with him.</hi>

               <p n="3">Dr. <hi>Alſtede,</hi> who hath laboured moſt earneſtly in his proofs about this point of the thouſand years, never makes any concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Chriſts viſible and perſonall comming down again to earth.

Onely Mr. <hi>Archer</hi> is bold, as to wreſt ſome other Scriptures, ſo here: and to make Chriſt viſibly come from, and return to Heaven according to his fancy, rather then any text well underſtood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> Bee it ſo, that Dr. <hi>Alſtede</hi> ſayes not, that Chriſt ſhall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly and perſonally reign on earth as Mr. <hi>Archer</hi> doth: yet <hi>bee aſſerts the reſurrection of the Martyrs, who are to reign with Christ, to bee demonſtrated <gap reason="foreign">

But the Martyrs are not yet riſen from their graves: therefore the Saints and Chriſts eminent Kingdom is not yet paſt. The ſpeech cannot bee of the Martyrs riſing from ſin, but from their graves. For 'tis mentioned after ſpeech of their beheading. Therefore it cannot be meant of a riſing from ſin in this life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Let it bee obſerved, that <hi>the Thrones were ſet,</hi> Apoc. 20. and 1. That wee moſtly agree in this, that <hi>the Apoſtles and other godly perſons are thoſe that ſit on the Thrones.</hi> 2. It is alſo confeſſed, that <hi>theſe were beheaded,</hi> or otherwiſe killed <hi>for their teſtimony to the Goſpel:</hi> both theſe were fulfilled in the Apoſtles, and other the Saints life time: So <hi>ſay</hi> I, was alſo their Judging the world by Gods word preached, <hi>as the word preached by Christ judged it, Joh:</hi> 12.28.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:112936:13"/>the context well, and of this there will bee no doubt. Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> (<hi>pag.</hi> 20 <hi>l. pen.</hi>) grants, that even now <hi>there is a reſurrection of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pretious ſouls, and that they reign with Christ in their hearts and families, as much as in them lies.</hi> So <hi>the Apoſtles</hi> and all good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <hi>roſe from the death of ſin, as Christ from the grave,</hi> Col. 3.1. <hi>and on earth ſought things above and in Heaven, where Christ is: they</hi> lived with Chriſt, as <hi>Henoch walked with God,</hi> Gen. 5.22. <hi>they reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this life through and with leſus Christ, from whom they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved abundance of grace, Rom.</hi> 5.17.</p>
               <p>And, thirdly, I anſwer, that this reigning with Chriſt is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion like others denoting the excellent priviledges of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and the great honours, which Chriſt confers on them. As namely, <hi>Christ treads Satan under his feet: true Chriſtians alſo tread on him,</hi> Rom. 16.20. <hi>Christ rules the Nations with a rod of iron, Chriſtians alſo doe the ſame,</hi> Rev. 2.27. <hi>Out of Chriſts mouth went at we edged ſword,</hi> Rev. 1.16. <hi>The word of God in the Miniſters mouth is a two edged ſword,</hi> Heb. 4.12. <hi>Christ treads on the aſpe, the lion, and dragon,</hi> Pſal. 91.13. <hi>Chriſts Apoſtles tread on ſerpents and ſcorpions, and nothing ſhall hurt them,</hi> Luke 10.14. <hi>Christ inherits the earth,</hi> Pſalm 2.8. <hi>So doe good Chriſtians,</hi> Mat. 5.5. Pſalm 37.9.11. Eſa. 60.21. As <hi>Christ hath a kingdom here on earth,</hi> Pſalm 2.6. Rev: 19.16. <hi>So the Saints are made Kings unto God,</hi> (not Kings over men, as <hi>David</hi>) <hi>and ſhall reign on the Earth,</hi> Rev. 5.10. <hi>Thus as is the heavenly man, ſuch are they that are heavenly,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.48, 49. <hi>True Chriſtians are the body of Christ, hee is their head,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.27.

               <p>And, ſecondly, concerning the Saints judging others, wee know that it belongs to the office of a judg to bind or to looſe, to acquit or condemn: which power that the Apoſtles might exerciſe <hi>Christ gave them the keyes and authority thereby to bind or to looſe, to acquit or condemn in his name, Mat.</hi> 16.19. By this means they had a greater power then Earthly Judges, who paſſe judgment onely upon mens bodies, liberty and goods: But <hi>Christ gave the Apoſtles power to remit and retain ſins, Joh.</hi> 20.23. and tels them, that <hi>what they hind or looſe on earth, is bound and looſed in Heaven, Mat.</hi> 18.18.

That Saint <hi>Lukes Goſpel was written of all things which Chriſt had done, Acts</hi> 1.1. whereas, <hi>ſo ſhort a book could not poſſibly contain each particular, Joh:</hi> 21.25. And Chriſt healed not all diſeaſed people, but any what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever that came unto him, or ſought by others for cure: nor did the light of the Goſpel by Chriſt brought in, benefit each particular perſon. For it is preſently there added: That <hi>the world knew him not,</hi> that <hi>his own knew him not.</hi> So then the meaning of theſe ſpeeches here urged muſt be limited according to other Scriptures. That is, <hi>all ſhall be ſaved by Chriſt, and all have eternall life, whoſoever believe in him,</hi> Joh. 3.15, 16. <hi>Whoſoever heare Chriſts commands and obey them, Mat:</hi> 7.24. this limitation is warranted, <hi>Joh:</hi> 6.45. where firſt it is ſaid, <hi>They ſhall bee all taught of God:</hi> there is the generall fully expreſſed: but preſently the reſtriction follows, <hi>

Other ſpeeches in the Prophets like theſe, are in the ſame manner to bee expounded. It is here ſaid, theſe things <hi>ſhall bee</hi> done, that is, as above, <hi>they ſhould and ought</hi> to bee done: Theſe and all other Nations were <hi>by the Apoſtles, to bee taught to doe what Chriſt commanded: the gates of the new Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem were opened to all people and Nations on each ſide of the City. And many perſons in all Nations were of old, and ſhall ſtill be called and redeemed, Acts</hi> 2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. Satan could not hinder the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel from being propagated: as I ſhall hereafter ſhew.</p>
               <p>Secondly, concerning the quiet and peace of the Chriſtian Church: <hi>though it have a place which paſſeth all underſtanding, Phil.</hi> 4.7. yet even in <hi>the Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> there muſt bee a <hi>patience and ſuffering,</hi> Rev. 1.9. <hi>The Saints have a bleſſed and quiet eſtate,</hi> but yet <hi>they firſt were in, and then came out of great tribulation,</hi> Rev. 7.14. <hi>The witneſſes were kild;</hi> but <hi>revived, and were taken up to Heaven,</hi> Rev. 11. <hi>Gods ſervants cry; but teares are wiped from their eyes. They have ſores, but cured with the leaves of the Tree of life: they thirſt, but are ſatisfyed with the waters of life; they undergoe ſorrow, pain, and death: but theſe are the firſt things;</hi> things that firſt they muſt ſuffer; <hi>but ſuch things as muſt paſſe away.</hi> Rev. 21. and 22. The Church is tryed, purged, whited by affliction (as Dr. <hi>Alſtede</hi> pag. 7.) Chriſt himſelf came from the croſſe to the Crown: and what befell the green tree, the dry can not eſcape. <hi>They that will live godly, muſt ſuffer perſecution,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.12. This is their portion in this life, as uſually Gods Word deſcribes it. <hi>The godly are trees planted by ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> Pſal. 1.3. Eſa. 14.8. and as trees endure many a ſharp froſt, and bitter ſtorm to make them take root the better: <hi>They are Vines,</hi> Pſal. 80.9. but muſt bee pruned, elſe they will bee luxuriant in boughes, deficient in fruit. <hi>What Son is there whom the Father cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſeth not?</hi> Heb. 12.7. Chriſt himſelf hath told us how theſe things may bee competible and conſiſtent. <hi>In the world,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>yee ſhall have trouble, in mee yee ſhall have peace.</hi> Joh. 16.33. So <hi>there may bee terrours within, and fightings without, but God is the comfort of his people,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.5, 6. The joy, the quiet repoſe, the happineſſe of the faithfull, is, <hi>to have God for their God,</hi> Rev. 21.3. And having
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:112936:17"/>him they can want nothing needfull, <hi>things preſent and things to come, all are theirs,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.22. They ſhall not want any thing that will work for their good, nor have any thing, which may procure their harm.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is not alwayes concluſive; God hath promiſed this or that: therefore undoubtedly it ſhall bee fulfilled <hi>interminis,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the expreſſe words. For, firſt, many of Gods promiſes bee conditionall, free in the promiſer, and not deſerved by us, though by Gods work upon us wee obey him, and hee fulfill his promiſe; but many promiſes by mans neglect of the condition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to bee cut off from beeing fulfilled. God promiſed that <hi>a man ſhould not ſtand before Iſrael in battle,</hi> Joſh. 1.5. yet ſometimes their ſins ſo provoked God, that the <hi>Canaanites</hi> foyled them. God ſaid that <hi>Elies houſe ſhould walk before him for ever: but now,</hi> ſaith hee, (upon their offending him) <hi>it ſhall not lee ſo. They that honour me, I will honour,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.30. And ſecondly, wee muſt ballance the promiſes of God made to his people, with the threats againſt them. God doth ſo, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2, 6. &amp;c. And makes both take effect, as to him ſeems good. <hi>Theſe good things,</hi> ſaith Zachary, <hi>ſhall come to paſſe, if yee obey the voyce of the Lord,</hi> Zach. 6.15. and by the rule of contraries, the evils ſhall come to paſſe, if they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, many promiſes are made good to Gods people in heaven with greater advantage, then they could bee on earth: God promiſes <hi>length of dayes and proſperity to ſuch as keep his Laws,</hi> Prov. 3.1, 2. yet <hi>Henoch</hi> lived not half ſo long as his fore-fathers, and <hi>Joſias</hi> had his years cut off in battle; though both Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. God made them a recompence in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Temporall promiſes are often fulfilled in this life, with much advantage in ſpirituall favours. God promiſes, that <hi>the wives of ſuch as fear God, ſhall bee as Vines on the houſe ſide, their children as Olive plants about their Tables,</hi> Pſal. 128.3. That <hi>the meek ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Land.</hi> Yet often good and faithfull men loſe wives, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, brothers, lands, and the like: but God then gives them ſpirituall graces in this life, <hi>Which are a hundred fold better for them;</hi> and in <hi>the life to come everlaſting bleſſedneſſe,</hi> Mark. 10.30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Chriſt viſibly and perſonally came, firſt, to bee incarnate: ſecondly, he ſo comes to receive his Kingdom: and thirdly, to judg all men at the worlds end. Some confound the ſecond and third

                  <hi>Object. Chriſts Kingdom is ſaid to bee at the ſeventh Trumpet, Rev.</hi> 11.15. and then all kingdoms in the world are ſubject unto him. <hi>Arch.</hi> p. 11. Likewiſe <hi>after the condemnation of the great Whore, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging of the Saints bloodſhed by her, Chriſt is ſaid to bee Lord of Lords and King of Kings.</hi> Therefore then towards the worlds end the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Kingdom of Chriſt begins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſts eminent Kingdom began, as was ſhewed above: and from his being upon earth, hee hath had the kingdom, power, and glory for ever. But as the <hi>Lord is evidently known, by executing judgment,</hi> Pſal. 9.16. ſo hee is eſpecially known and taken notice of by men, to bee King, when hee in evident manner ſhews his power in defending his ſervants, and in plaguing his enemies. Hence it is, that <hi>when hee ruined Pharaoh and his Hoſt,</hi> Moſes ſaid, <hi>The Lord reignes for ever and ever,</hi> Exod. 15.18. <hi>When hee ſmote the Philiſtins with Emeroids, and kept them under in Samuels time,</hi> no King leading forth the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Armies, 'tis alſo ſaid, that <hi>God is their King,</hi> 1 Sam. 8.7. and 12.12. <hi>When the fury of buls, dogs, lions, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicorns prevailed not over Chriſt,</hi> ſo that hee conquered all power oppoſit unto him, <hi>David</hi> ſung, <hi>The Kingdom is the Lords,</hi> Pſal. 22.28. When <hi>David himſelf overcame the enemies of his kingdom,</hi> which was a type of Chriſts, 'tis ſaid, <hi>The Lord reigneth,</hi> 1 Chron. 16.31. When Satan is conquered by <hi>Michael,</hi> then it is proclaimed: That <hi>the Kingdom is the Lords,</hi> Rev. 12.10. When Chriſt judges and plagues <hi>Rome, hee is ſtiled King of Kings,</hi> Rev. 19.16. When at the day of judgment all his enemies are wholly caſt down under his feet, and lie at his mercy and diſpoſure to bee judged: then 'tis ſaid, <hi>That the kingdoms of this world are our Lords, even Chriſts,</hi> Rev. 11.15. Hee that was firſt ſtiled Prince of the Kings of the Earth, Rev. 1.5. then plainly at laſt appears ſo to bee: what the wicked out of their

The wicked may domineer for a time, yet ſhall bee, not onely in the four hundred years after Chriſt, but oftentimes afterward foiled: and in the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:112936:19"/>end the victory ſhall be on the Saints party; who are the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the New Jeruſalem.

               <p>Thirdly, that God, not delighting in mens deſtruction, lets the wicked eat the wickeds fleſh, and drink each others blood. Hee pulled down <hi>Aram;</hi> and the neigbouring Nations by <hi>Babel, Babel</hi> by <hi>Perſia,</hi> the <hi>Perſians</hi> by <hi>Alexander</hi> King of Greece and his chief Captains, the Greeks the poſterity of <hi>Seleucus</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> by the <hi>Romans;</hi> the chief <hi>Roman</hi> rulers, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, by mutuall conflicts among themſelves, and by the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> &amp; others: and at the laſt day will utterly deſtroy and aboliſh that wicked State with the brightneſſe of his comming, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.8. What befell <hi>Babylon, Tyre, Damaſcus</hi> of <hi>Aram, Kir</hi> and <hi>Ar</hi> of <hi>Moab, Dumah</hi> of <hi>Edom, Zoan</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> will at length befall <hi>Rome.</hi> For among the wicked there is an eminent and ſuperlative wicked State, <hi>called the wicked one, whom God will deſtroy, Eſa:</hi> 11.4. and this is, as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan Ben Vzziel</hi> ſaith, <hi>Armylus,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> power (ſaith Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi>) by originall from <hi>Romulus,</hi> the word denotes him with no greater change then <hi>Armathia</hi> is put for <hi>Ramath.</hi> Nor can the <hi>Roman</hi> Beaſt fall alone, the heads of divers Countries, the <hi>ten Kings fall with him, Rev:</hi> 16.14. and <hi>their poſterity turn to Chriſts ſide, verſe</hi> 16. Thus Chriſt brings them low, that carry their heads full high, he quels their power, and demoliſhes their cities.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Chriſt who hath, and ſtill doth plague his enemies, obſerves the time of their ſins <hi>being ripe for the harveſt, Rev.</hi> 14.15. and come to the full height: and then <hi>makes them drink full cups out of the winepreſſe of his wrath.</hi> Thus, to conclude, it is manifeſt that the New Jeruſalem ſhall ſubſiſt and prevail: and that the City, which in Saint <hi>Johns</hi> time ruled over the Kings of the Earth, and which would then have no King but <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and now would have the Pope above all Kings (perſiſting in one and the ſame fin of making lawfull Princes her vaſſals) ſhall ſtill boe decaying, and at laſt bee utterly deſtroyed. But hence can not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:112936:19"/>be concluded that the Chriſtian Church ſhall enjoy on Earth ſuch, and ſo long felicity, as Mr. <hi>Archer</hi> and ſome others plead for; and it is probable that ſuch proſperity would bring more da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the Church, then could affection. The Churches experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath uſually found it ſo to doe: and on good ground hath contented it ſelf with ſome ſmall meaſure of outward comforts, ſweetned with plenty and abundance of ſpirituall refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> You take the term Ieruſalem in a myſticall ſenſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the corporall and outward felicity of the Church, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting us to ſpirituall bleſſings. If thus you fly to Allegorizing texts, and turning plain evidences for corporall matters to ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, you may eaſily put off any Scripture produced againſt your opinion. There is no ſufficient reaſon why thus you ſhould doe.</p>

                  </gap>, ſpeeches Allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. Chriſt often ſpake by parables, and parabolically and ſpiritually expounded divers paſſages of the Old Teſtament in the New: as <hi>Rahels weeping for her Children, the Sheep ſcattered, when the Shepheard was ſmitten,</hi> and the like. And more punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the matter in hand, in expreſſing of this very allegory, it is ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. That the old Jeruſalem is in bondage with her children, the unbeleeving Jews; and that the new Jeruſalem, and all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full her children are free from bondage, and thereupon are called the children of God. Let ſuch as have gone too far in allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries anſwer for it. This Allegory hath ſufficient warrant.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Dr. <hi>Alſtede</hi> himſelf confeſſes, and that aright, that by <hi>Moab</hi> ſometimes the Churches enemies are meant, <hi>page</hi> 44. by <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> falſe brethren, <hi>page</hi> 44. by <hi>Bozra</hi> and <hi>Babel, Rome, page</hi> 44. by <hi>Sion,</hi> the Church of Chriſt, <hi>page</hi> 42. And in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> neither is <hi>Manna,</hi> nor <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> nor the <hi>tree of life,</hi> nor the leafs therof literally, but figuratively to be underſtood. So are diverſe other terms in that book, as the moſt and beſt Expoſitors grant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Chriſt being riſen from death, <hi>ſpake many things to the Diſeiples concerning the Kingdom of God,</hi> Acts 1.3. and thereupon the Apoſtles jointly ask Chriſt: <hi>Lord wilt thou at this time reſtore the kingdom to Iſrael? verſe</hi> 6. Now the Apoſtles having both lately and formerly heard Chriſt often preach; were men of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and could not poſſibly (in asking Chriſt concerning the reſtoring the Kingdom to Iſrael, ſuch a Kingdom, as once Iſrael
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:112936:20"/>had, and as other Monarchs had on earth) bee deceived, and erre in a matter of ſo great concernment to the whole Nation. See <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher page</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Firſt, all that hold, that the <hi>Iews</hi> ſhal again have an earthly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſuch as other Monarchs have had &amp; that the Diſciples inquired of that Kingdom; and that the Kingdom, which God promiſed Chriſt, is not begun one thouſand ſix hundred years ſince that queſtion, muſt neceſſarily hold, that the Diſciples both could and did erre about the time of that Kingdom: and therby make them not ſo underſtanding as they deſire to doe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I conceive that the Apoſtles did not erre about the time. <hi>John Baptist and Christ had taught them often, that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven,</hi> that <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.14.18. <hi>was at hand:</hi> and religious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple among the Jews, even in that corrupt time, <hi>waited for, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that the conſolation of Iſrael, and the kingdom of God ſhould appeare, Luke</hi> 1.25. <hi>Mark</hi> 15.43. And even about the time of that queſtion, in regard of Chriſt the head of that Kingdom, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was come: for to him are aſcribed Kingdom, Power and Glory for ever and ever, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. But in regard of the Jews and others, who ſhould bee members and ſubjects of that Kingdom, ſeeing it was to bee a Kingdom within them, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.21. it could not come <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ſo obſervably,</hi> that any one could ſay, this is the very time of mens becomming ſubjects of this kingdom; for ſome did partake of this kingdom ſooner, ſome la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſome with a weaker, others with a ſtronger faith; all, even the beſt, might increaſe in faith: and in this regard all muſt pray, <hi>Thy kingdom come,</hi> let it more and more daily rule in our hearts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if <hi>the kingdom of God,</hi> Acts 1.3. <hi>and the kingdom of Iſrael be all one,</hi> as indeed they are, the Apoſtles erred not much about the benefit of this kingdom, <hi>which ſhould redound to the Saints,</hi> Dan. 7.22. and <hi>to the Iſrael of God, Gal.</hi> 6.16. that is, <hi>to a remnant of the Jews, Rom:</hi> 9.27. and elſwhere often: and to the Gentiles, as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was taught, Acts</hi> 10.35. to a multitude of them: <hi>Rev</hi> 7.9. For neither doth the ſpeech, <hi>In thee ſhall all the Gentiles bee bleſſed, Gal:</hi> 3.8. Nor the ſpeech, All Iſrael ſhall bee ſaved, <hi>Rom:</hi> 11.26. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend any more of each party <hi>obtaining peace and mercy, then ſuch as walk according to Chriſts rule, Gal:</hi> 6.16. which is, <hi>whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves in Chriſt ſhall have life eternall, Job:</hi> 3.16. In this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, remembring what Chriſt had ſo often inculcated, erred not,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:112936:20"/>as I conceive: yet might they erre in ſome circumſtances of this Kingdom, eſpecially in ſuch as concerned their miniſtery about the ſame: Chriſt therefore, who had given them commiſſion <hi>to teach all Nations to doe what bee</hi> as a King (elſe what authority had he to ſend out his Edicts?) <hi>commanded;</hi> tels them in effect, that hee indeed ſhould have a kingdom over Iſrael, and that <hi>themſelves ſhould in due time (which the Father reſerved in his own power) receive power from the holy Ghoſt to bear witneſſe of, and to propagate this kingdom of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>DIverſe learned men have imployed their time and pains about the times ſpoken of in <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard both of the excellency of their parts, and of their diligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſall of what hath formerly been written thereof, may bee thought in all probability to have found out the truth, yet may perhaps have miſſed thereof.

               <p>Secondly, <hi>That</hi> Conſtantine <hi>impriſoned Satan, that is, the wicked Emperours, and bound them a thouſand years, by ſo ſetling the government, that they could not domineer over the Church, as formerly: In this time,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>Antichriſt reigned, and the Saints lived and reigned with Chriſt, that is, embraced the Truth. This period of time,</hi> Rev. 20.2. laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one thouſand years.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That <hi>Satan was looſed. And then the Turk plagued the Roman Empire three hundred ninty five years: that hee likewiſe vexed the falſe Church that of Rome, and the true Church, which began to appear out of the wilderneſſe in the year one thouſand three hundred, and forſook Romiſh ſuperstition, and opening her eyes to the truth, roſe from death by the firſt reſurrection. Three hundred years are now paſt,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>ſince this began. Further the Turk ſhall begin to fall in the year one thouſand ſix hundred and fifty, and bee quite overthrown in the year one thouſand ſix hundred ninty five; Antichriſts or the Popes fall is in the year one thouſand ſix hundred eighty ſix. After this, the Jews ſhall bee called, and the Gentiles alſo come into the true Church. So that ſeven hundred years moe being added to the three hundred above, the Church ſhall enjoy happy times, and the Gentiles continue in the truth. This period of time,</hi> Rev: 20.4. <hi>is of years,</hi> ſaith hee, one thouſand.</p>
               <p>Theſe three periods of time extend to two thouſand three hundred years. <hi>How long after the Jews ſhall continue to embrace the Truth, God,</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:112936:21"/>ſaith hee, <hi>hath not revealed, nor can any man tell. But at length the world ſhall grow ſecure and wicked, and then Chriſt will come and put an end to the Saints ſufferings and patience, and to the malice and miſehievous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes of the ungodly againſt them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some truth is in theſe paſſages, to it I aſſent. Firſt, Tis true, <hi>that the wicked Emperours did perſecute the Church, untill</hi> Conſtantines <hi>time.</hi> I adde, that ſome of them after his time did alſo vex the Church. <hi>Tis a truth alſo, that</hi> Conſtantine <hi>ſetled Chriſtian government.</hi> But not ſo, ſay I, that is continued one thouſand years from his time. For <hi>Rome</hi> infected the world with error, about one thouſand years after Chriſt. I approve alſo <hi>his expoſition of Antichriſts reigning, and of the Saints living and reigning at the ſame time with Chriſt:</hi> But I hold theſe things not ſetled by him within their due limits of time. Tis true <hi>that riſing from Romiſh ſuperſtition and errour is a firſt reſurrection in ſome;</hi> but I adde further, that all riſing from ſin in this life, is likewiſe a firſt reſurrection. I grant alſo that <hi>the Turks have much plagued Rome, and that both Turks and Popes have don great miſchief to the true Church, and that their tyranny ſhall fall in due time.</hi> But the juſt year of their fall, who can tell? Laſtly, <hi>the Jews calling and the Gentiles fuller converſion may juſtly bee expected and indevoured.</hi> But, <hi>Goe teach all Nations,</hi> expreſſes a command to us, and a duty for them, ever from Chriſts time to the worlds end. What more I do approve will appear in other parts of this Diſcourſe, with my reaſons thereof.</p>
               <p>That many other paſſages herein are unſound and groundleſſe, I will particularly ſhew. Firſt, Satan himſelf (and not the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Emperours his inſtruments) is bound, <hi>Rev:</hi> 20.2. And leſt any ſhould miſtake herein, bee that is bound, is expreſly ſet forth by four titles; <hi>the Dragon, the old Serpent, the Devill, and Satan;</hi> So alſo <hi>Rev:</hi> 12.9. And ſecondly, <hi>bee that is bound, is tyed faſt from deceiving the Nations.</hi> Now the old and grand deceiver is Satan himſelf; and <hi>Rev:</hi> 12.9. is called (as indeed hee was before Chriſts time) <hi>the deceiver of the whole world.</hi> The Emperours courſe was <hi>by the ſword and violent meanes of war,</hi> not by wiles. Whence, <hi>Rev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> 13.4. the brag is made: <hi>who can war with the Beaſt?</hi> Therefore Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan himſelf, and not the Emperours, was bound.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if <hi>Conſtantine</hi> bound Satan, firſt, it may as well bee ſaid, that <hi>Maxentius</hi> a cruel Tyrant, <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> and other Arrians, <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:112936:22"/>and other the like wicked Emperours let him looſe again. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how could <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who ruled but thirty years, binde Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan a thouſand years? it muſt bee Chriſt, who by his Almighty and endleſſe power could binde Satan ſo long a time. Thirdly, when Satan was caſt down from heaven <hi>into the earth and Sea,</hi> Rev: 12, which are termed the <hi>Abyſſe, in which hee was bound,</hi> Rev: 20. <hi>hee gives his power and great autority to the beaſt,</hi> Rev: 13.2. that is, as moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors hold, the ſecular power of <hi>Rome;</hi> 1. in the wicked Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours; 2. in the Popes arrogating the ſame. Satan therefore was bound, the wicked Emperours were looſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Satan is not looſed, <hi>

                     </gap> John de Ganduno, John Wiclif,</hi> and others, as Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> would have it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Suppoſe it granted that three hundred years are paſt, ſince popiſh errours were gainſaid (as indeed when ever did any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour manifeſtly ſpring, but God had his witneſſes of truth to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it?) what glound have wee to affirm <hi>that ſome Gentiles ſhall held the truth ſeven hundred years moe, and the Jews no man knows how long after that?</hi> By this account the world ſhould endure two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred years after Chriſts time: which ſome learned men deny, others will not define: nor hath Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> any found Argument to prove it. If hee urg from <hi>Apocalyps</hi> 20. the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:112936:22"/>
                  <hi>thouſand years mentioned for the reigning of the Saints with Chriſt,</hi> and then the <hi>thouſand years before them, for Satans binding, hee may as well adde a thouſand years moe, in which the Saints ſhall bee prieſts of God, and reign alſo with him.</hi> For the thouſand years are a third time named; and by this means hee will make the world continue three thouſand three hundred years, from Chriſts time. Hee may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>make the woman</hi> Rev: 12.6. and 13. <hi>fly twiſe into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi> becauſe there her flight is twiſe mentioned. In this way I think Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> will walk without company.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Concerning the Turks Mr. <hi>Medes</hi> opinion is more probable, firſt, that <hi>their dominion began when</hi> Tangolipex <hi>was made King in the year</hi> one thouſand fifty ſeven, not in the year one thouſand three hundred, as ſales Mr. <hi>Brightman.</hi> Secondly, that from the year one thouſand fifty ſeven, count three hundred nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſix years moe, which come to the year one thouſand foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fifty three, and then in this very year the Turks took <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> and roſe to greater might: and not began to fall, as Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> affirms they ſhould after three hundred ninty ſix years. Thirdly, the Text is expreſſe, that upon the times mentioned <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poc.</hi> 9.13. <hi>they ſhould kill the third part of man;</hi> whereas the Text hath not one word of their fall; <hi>nor is the ruin of the Turkiſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire foretold in what year it ſhould fall,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Mede.</hi> And again Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> ſtill holding his accuſtomed ingenuity, gives another ſenſe of <hi>Apoc.</hi> 9.15. thus: <hi>The Turks will bee prepared for a fit time,</hi> to wit, <hi>for a day, a moneth, and a year, to kill the third part of men.</hi> And ſurely this ſenſe is more probable then the other, depending upon the expoſition of each day for a year, which is not to take place, except ſomthing in the Prophecy lead us thereunto.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, If the ten horned beaſt, <hi>Rev:</hi> 13.1 bee not the Popes, as they are Clergy men, but the ſecular Rulers of <hi>Rome;</hi> then Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> erres in making this beaſt to expreſſe Antichriſt, or the Popes onely. Secondly, hee erres in ſaying that this beaſt began in the year three hundred and ſix; whereas the <hi>Caeſars</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan before, and were in Saint <hi>Johns</hi> time. For it is ſaid of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven heads, that five are paſt, that one is, <hi>Rev:</hi> 11.10. that is, the <hi>Ceſars.</hi> And then thirdly, if this beaſt bee to rule two and forty moneths in Mr. <hi>Brightmans</hi> ſenſe, they muſt begin in or before Saint <hi>Johns</hi> time, and ſo muſt bee ended many years agon: though his account for the wounded beaſts cure, bee taken in to make the

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:112936:24"/>happy. And therefore the afflictions of the Jews, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. cannot bee thoſe inflicted on them by <hi>Antiochus. Brightman, Dan.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> beeing himſelf out of the right way, by a falſe light, ſtrives to hold on others in their ſtraying by-pathes, for companies ſake. Wee ſinde that at <hi>the end of three years and an half, the Temple was cleanſed, and ſacrifices renewed,</hi> Joſeph. Bell. Jud. 1.1. Nor did <hi>Antio bus,</hi> or his ſon, or any Prince of the Greeks ever prevail againſt the Jews, their Temple and ſacrifices in like manner, as <hi>Antiochus</hi> had don. So that this kinde of miſery of the Jews was then accompliſhed and ended: and of no other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, but that brought on them by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> is the ſpeech in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. There is not a word of the miſeries that ſhould befall them by the <hi>Romans.</hi> Secondly, the very words ſpoken of <hi>Antiochus</hi> time (as Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> himſelf holds, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.35.) are iterated in <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Many ſhall bee purifyed, made white, and tryed; but the wicked ſhall doe wickedly: and none of the wicked ſhall have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but the wiſe ſhall underſtand.</hi> Iteration of the ſame ſpeech in ſubſtance, ſhews the ſame thing to bee inſiſted upon. <hi>So mention of judgement on the Saints behalf, and their poſſeſſing a kingdom is twiſe ſpoken of,</hi> Dan. 7.22. &amp; 27. <hi>in the expoſition of the viſion.</hi> So the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Apoc. 12.6. and 14. <hi>is twiſe ſaid to fly into the Wilderneſſe.</hi> So Apoc. 17.12. and 17. <hi>The ten Kings are twiſe ſaid to give their power and authority to the Beaſt.</hi> Thus in theſe places there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration upon the ſame thing. To the very ſame purpoſe are the words above doubled in <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. and 12. As Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> hath well obſerved, and thence inferres that the ſame matter is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon: and that the matters ſpoken of <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.11, 12. belong to <hi>Antiochus</hi> time, and not to the time of <hi>Titus</hi> making <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> deſolate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> The times limits will not agree with <hi>Antiochus</hi> dealings. <hi>For</hi> Antiochus <hi>his taking away the daily ſacrifice, and ſetting up the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination of deſolation was but from</hi> Kiſlen 25. Anno 145. <hi>of</hi> Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus <hi>his kingdom to</hi> Kiſleu 25. Anno 148.1 Macc. 1.57. and 4.52. <hi>Onely before theſe three years, which are the preciſe time, there were ten dayes moe;</hi> in <hi>which the beginning of his wicked attempt was made known. Nor is it materiall that</hi> Joſephus, De bell. Judaic. 1.1. ſaith, <hi>that the daily ſacrifice was taken away by</hi> Antiochus, <hi>three years and an half.</hi> For tis ſaid, 1 Macc. 4.54. <hi>that the ſame day that the Gentiles defiled

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Mr. <hi>Brightmans</hi> miſpriſions beguile ſome others, elſe ſhould I not ſpend ſo much time in anſwering him. To clear the whole matter, obſerve that in <hi>Anno</hi> 145. of the Greeks, <hi>Antiochus first ſent an Hoſte to Jeruſalem,</hi> 1 Mac. 1.30. which ſpoiled and fired the City, captived and kild many, made others flye, and give place to ſtrangers, and laid waſte the Sanctuary. Secondly, <hi>Hee ſent letters and Meſſengers,</hi> to enjoyn the Jews to follow the Laws of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, to neglect their Sabbaths, Feaſts, and Sacrifices (mark here the daily Sacrifice amongſt the reſt hindred) to erect new Altars, and to ſacrifice Swines fleſh thereon, to omit Circumciſion on pain of death. Thirdly, <hi>In this very year the fifteenth of</hi> Kiſleu, <hi>the abomination was ſet upon the Altar.</hi> And fourthly, on the <hi>five and twentyeth of</hi> Kiſleu, <hi>ſacrifice was after the beathen manner offered</hi> on the Altar. Suppoſe now that both the books of <hi>Maccabees</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> ſay truely, that on what day of the year the Altar was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſhly ſacrificed on, even on the ſame day, juſt three years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Jews in holy manner ſacrificed on their purged and rebuilt Altar, yet the other tyrannous dealings of <hi>Antiochus</hi> over the Jews, and his inhibiting their ſacrifices, his firing, killing, and other miſchievous deeds may very well take up half a year more. And thus ſhall <hi>Joſephus</hi> bee <hi>as religious a witneſſe for the three years and an half,</hi> as for any other true paſſage of Story. Becauſe this his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe accords with <hi>time, times, and half a time.</hi> And hence it may appear that <hi>Joſephus,</hi> better in his time underſtood <hi>Daniels</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in this point, then Mr. <hi>Brightman,</hi> and <hi>is wrong fully here charged to have corrupted the Story:</hi> Whereas hee living neerer thoſe times might either know the truth certainly from the common aſſent of his Nation, or might, as a reaſonable man, judge, that the miſchiefs done by <hi>Antoochus</hi> before the ſacrificing on the Altar on the five and twentyeth day of <hi>Kiſlen,</hi> might very well take up a full half years time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Here I ſhall produce one objection more then Mr. <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> thought upon: for hee is ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>enough to ſpeak for himſelf, what came into his minde, if not ſometimes more then is ſound and concluſive. This it is. Seeing that in the <hi>Apocalyps, time, times and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:112936:25"/>half a time,</hi> have correſpondent to them <hi>dayes one thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty, and two and forty moneths,</hi> how is it, that here <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> his dealings are bounded twiſe <hi>by time, times, and half a time,</hi> Dan. 7.25. &amp; 12.7. &amp; Chap. 12.11. <hi>by one thouſand two hundred and ninety dayes,</hi> and not as in the <hi>Apocalyps, by one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I might here anſwer that <hi>Chetſz</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.7. tranſlated <hi>half a time,</hi> is in Chap: 7.25. expreſſed by <hi>Peleg</hi> a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding or <hi>part of time:</hi> and that <hi>Chetſi</hi> ſignifies not always ajuſt half. Thus, and that truely, ſaith the learned and painfull Dr. <hi>Willet.</hi> I prove this to bee ſo. Becauſe the verb <hi>Chatſa</hi> (whence <hi>Chetſi</hi> comes) expreſſes a <hi>dividing into three parts,</hi> Judg. 9.43. and the dividing of <hi>Jacobs</hi> wives and children into four parts. Nor were the children equally parted, but with <hi>Leah</hi> were mo then with any of the reſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. and <hi>Judg.</hi> 7.16. three hundreth men are divided (here alſo <hi>Chatſa</hi> is uſed) into three parts. Nor is it eaſie to prove, that <hi>the Idolater,</hi> Eſa. 44.16, 19. <hi>made an image of one juſt half of the block, and roaſted his meat with the other juſt half there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> or that <hi>David</hi> did riſe juſt in the middle of the night to praiſe God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.62.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly admit that the word <hi>Chetſi,</hi> ſignifies half of the year, and not a leſſe part, ten dayes or the like: I will endeavour by Scripture to ſhew (for I may not here laſh out largely to make uſe of the learned diſquiſitions of <hi>Joh. Lalamantius, Joſ. Scaliger,</hi> and our Countryman Mr. <hi>Th. Lydiat,</hi> or of the lately produced, and learned Treatiſe of Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> much to bee honoured for his excellent skill in ſeverall kinds) what wee are to judge of the extent of a year in Gods account. Here firſt, I ſay, that <hi>time, times, and half a tims, and two and forty moneths, and one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes,</hi> terms uſed in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> expreſſe the very ſame extent of time; and uſually Expoſiters make them ſo to doe. Now one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes divided to two and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty moneths afford to each moneth juſt thirty dayes. And that each moneth had ſo many (and no moneth of five moneths together, had but nine and twenty dayes) we ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.24. <hi>Where one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty dayes are the juſt extent of time from the ſeventeenth day of the ſecond moneth, to the ſeventeenth day of the ſeventh moneth,</hi> Gen. 7.11. &amp; 8.4. Therefore the uſuall year in Scriptures account con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of twelve moneths, each of them having thirty dayes. So
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:112936:26"/>that there are given to every year three hundred and ſixty daies by this account. And that by <hi>one time,</hi> a year is meant, wee finde by <hi>ſeven times,</hi> that is, ſeven years <hi>paſſing over Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> Dan. 4.29. Here again it may bee objected. If theſe things bee thus, <hi>how then,</hi> in Dan. 12.11. <hi>dee one thouſand two hundred and ninty daies an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to time, times, and half a time?</hi> and ſeeing God in difficulties, gives (where they are for our capacities and clearer inſtruction) different expreſſions, why are not two and forty moneths at any time in <hi>Daniel</hi> mentioned, where the Prophet diligently inquired after a punctuall expreſſion of time?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In every year according to the courſe of the Sun, are daies three hundred ſixty five. This generally all hold. The five odde daies are omitted in the account, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11. where one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and ſixty <hi>daies, anſwer to two and forty moneths.</hi> But thoſe five daies overplus in ſix years make thirty daies, or a full moneth. And therefore to time, times, and half a time, or three years and an half in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.7. wee finde correſpondent one thouſand two hundred and ninty daies, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.11. for ſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it muſt needs fall out, when the moneth or thirty daies made of the five odde daies in ſix years, are taken into the year. See <hi>Coch in Sanedr. pag. 9.</hi> Mr. <hi>Broughton in M. S. Sionenſ. Colleg.</hi> And by this alſo wee ſee that this moneth ſupernumerary, added in the three years and an half in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. could not admit the number of two and forty moneths: as the three years and an half did in the <hi>Apocalyps;</hi> where two and forty moneths, and one thouſand two hundred and ſixty, are equivalent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object. The little horn,</hi> Dan. 8.9. <hi>is Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi> But the <hi>little horn,</hi> Dan. 7.8. and 20. is not <hi>Antiochus,</hi> but it is doubtleſſe the Turk, and the number of <hi>time, times, and half a time,</hi> Dan. 7.25. and 12.7. are one and the ſame, and belong to the Turk. That they have reſpect to diverſe perſons it is proved. Becauſe <hi>the viſion in Chap. 7. is ſten to come out of the Sea: the viſion Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>is by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lai.</hi> The former viſion is written in Chaldee, becauſe it is a Prophecy concerning all men: the later in Hebrew, becauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly concerns the Jews. <hi>Brightman on Dan.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Sea and Ulai can no more make <hi>the little horns</hi> of Chap. 7. and 8. to denote diverſe perſons, then <hi>one appearing amidſt the ſeven golden Candleſsticks, and having ſeven ſtars in his hand,</hi> Rev. 1.13. and <hi>one riding on a white horſe with many crowns on his head, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:112936:26"/>Rev. 19.11. ſet forth diverſe perſons. Here deſcriptions much different, expreſſe one Chriſt: and there expreſſions a little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, one and the ſame <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The difference of the tongues can much leſſe doe it. For then <hi>the Bear,</hi> Chap. 7. and the <hi>Ram,</hi> Chap. 8. ſhould not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like expreſſe the Dominion of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> becauſe the viſions are told in different languages. Adde thereunto that the one of theſe roſe out of the Sea, the other was ſeen by the River Ulai. Wee ſee hereby how Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> doating on a falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, uſes any ſleight argumentation to boulſter on the matter. The reaſon why the eighth Chapter is in Hebrew, is this. There the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> and Greeks are expreſly named: whereby the Expoſition of that viſion is a key to open all the reſt of the viſions: and therefore is in a tongue ſtrange to the Chaldees, fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Jews: as Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> moſt judiciouſly obſerved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object. The little horn</hi> Dan. 7. <hi>is belonging to the fourth kingdom;</hi> therefore to the <hi>Romans. The little horn,</hi> Dan. 8. comes out of one of the Goats four horns. But the <hi>little horn,</hi> Chap. 7. <hi>is one horn with the other nine, on the fourth Beaſt.</hi> And therefore denotes not one and the ſame <hi>Antiochus.</hi> Mr. <hi>Brightman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have above proved, that the Greek kingdom parted between the Syrian and Egyptian Princes is the fourth kingdom in <hi>Daniel.</hi> The little horn therefore on the fourth Beaſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. is of their race, and was <hi>Antiochus.</hi> And in Chap. 8. The Goat bucks firſt horn is <hi>Alexander</hi> the great. The four horns on the ſame beaſt are <hi>Alexanders</hi> four chief Captains. Of theſe, two were of no long continuance: the other two <hi>Seleucus Nicator,</hi> and <hi>Proleme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Lagides</hi> ſubſiſted a long time mighty in themſelves and their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity: and at length became weak, not long before Chriſts time. Theſe two and their ſucceſſours make the fourth kingdom, and are expreſſed by the two legs and feet of the Image, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. and by the fourth Beaſt that had ten horns, Chap. 7. <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> a King that rather deſired to bee, then could attain to bee great, was one horn with the other nine horns, Chap. 7. And thus hee is the little horn in both, Chap. 7. and 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> But <hi>Antiochus</hi> cannot bee the little horn, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. becauſe when <hi>the reign of the little horn ends, the Son of man takes his kingdom o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all Nations,</hi> which Chriſt did not preſently upon <hi>Antiochus</hi> death.

The Turks have had no joynt agreement and fellowſhip in their deſignes and attempts with the Romans againſt the true Church, but rather moſt deadly hate the Roman Church, as for other reaſons, ſo alſo becauſe it allows of Images in Gods worſhip, which the Turks from the expreſſe words of <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. abominate. If one beaſt ſhould expreſſe the Roman and Turkiſh dominions, they ſhould agree in ſingular amitie, aſſiſtance, mutuall defence, and Law, as did the Medes and Perſians, who are typed by one beaſt. Or elſe they ſhould by mutuall intermariages endeavour to make the like friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, though without ſucceſſe, as did the Seleucidans, and Lagidans, &amp; as the deſcription of the fourth kingdom, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.43. expreſſes it.

                  </gap> Mr. <hi>Archer</hi> miſſes the marke and ſhoots extremely wide, where hee makes <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate the ſetter up of the abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of deſolation ſpoken of by <hi>Daniel.</hi> This wretched Emperour doubtleſſe aſpired to the height of wickedneſſe, but was prevented of this inglorious achievement both by <hi>Antiochus</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> as I have already ſhewed. Hee not onely came too late for the worke, but could effect nothing hee deſired: and was ſo far from taking away the Jewiſh ſacrifices (which is one main thing, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.11. mentioned) that hee attempted to ſet them up in contempt of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and Chriſt their maſter.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Both Dr. <hi>Alſtede</hi> and Mr. <hi>Archer</hi> and others of their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on erre in multiplying one thouſand two hundred dayes to the number of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Tis true that dayes bee put for years, <hi>Ezck.</hi> 4. but tis not conſequent that in all other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies it ſhould bee ſo: Nor indeed in any can it bee ſo: but where ſome circumſtances require it, or God plainly ſayes as to <hi>Ezekiel: 1 appoint thee a day for a yeare, a day for a yeare.</hi> To him the words are doubled, that wee ſhould not miſtake. In <hi>Daniel</hi> wee find them not ſingle. And muſt not of our owne heads deviſe, what was never intended. 2. The dayes two thouſand three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.14. bee properly underſtood of dayes according to Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> and others: Why then may not one thouſand two hundred dayes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.11. be ſo likewiſe expounded?</p>
               <p>Reply. <hi>Dayes</hi> one thouſand two hundred and ſixtie, <hi>and moneths</hi> fortie two, in the Revelation expreſſe a longer time then the bare words import. So may the ſumme here. If you ſay <hi>that in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyps is meant properly ſo many dayes or moneths, you accord with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, who hold that Antichriſt ſhall reign but juſt three years and a half.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I know well <hi>that Chriſts ſervants,</hi> Rev. 11. <hi>witneſſe to his truth, that the beaſt,</hi> Rev. 13.1. <hi>rages, that the woman clad with the Sun, Rev.</hi> 12. <hi>is preſerved in the Wilderneſſe</hi> longer then three years and a half, though the limits of their times expreſſed, properly ſignifie no longer a ſpade: but I ſay further, that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:112936:28"/>phraſes and formes of ſpeech in the Revelation have often reference to former matters to which they have ſome reſemblance: So <hi>Babel</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> ſignifie not properly, but metaphorically places and States like them for miſchiefs done to Gods people, and their ruine thereupon: So the three years and an halfe of the Saints preaching and perſecution is not properly juſt ſo long, but hath a reference unto Chriſts preaching and perſecution, which was in proprietie of ſpeech juſt ſo long. This is to ſhew that the Saints caſe is like Chriſts, and the time not properly, but by alluſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of them: So in Scripture <hi>the Saints afflictions</hi> are called <hi>the afflictions of Chriſt, Col.</hi> 1.24. and <hi>the Saints are ſaid to have <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> a ſhare and part of Chriſts ſufferings, Phil.</hi> 3.10. and <hi>to bee <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> comformable and like to Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 8.29. and Saint <hi>John and other Chriſtians are ſaid to bee companions in tribulation, and in the Kingdome of Chriſt, Rev.</hi> 1.9.</p>
               <p>Thus Chriſt is the great and eminent both Teacher of and ſufferer for the truth; his ſervants imitate his actions, and are like to him in ſuffering. Such was the courſe of Chriſts publick miniſtery, whilſt hee lived, ſuch muſt be theirs untill their deaths. As hee, ſo they muſt hold out and continue faithfull in their callings. His time was but three years and an half: theirs may bee leſſe, perhaps ſomething more; but however, it will bee a momentary and ſhort ſpace in regard of the eternall weight of glory, which follows it, Againe, as the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſome purer, ſome more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, ſome in diverſe reſpects praiſ-worthy, others in as many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects juſtly to bee blamed, ſhew the ſtate and condition of ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and more Churches, and what Chriſt hath to ſay to them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their like obedience or diſobedience unto him: So the teaching and ſufferings of Chriſt in three yeares and an halfe ſhew, what ſhall bee the caſe of his ſervants in three times three or moe years of their miniſtry? So that time is put for the condition of the time and things done therein. As, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.24. The Prophets foretold theſe times. And <hi>Eſther</hi> 1.13. wiſe men knowing the times: that is, things done in the times. And Chriſt ſaith, Father keep me from that houre, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.17. that uphold me in the ſorrowes of that houre.</p>
               <p>Thus then yon ſee apparently that I run not into the Papiſts er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who abſurdly bound Antichriſts perſecution, and the Saints
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:112936:29"/>ſufferings to three years and an half; <hi>Rome</hi> firſt in its wicked and Idolatrous Emperours; ſecondly, in its proud and ſuperſtitious Popes hath been an <hi>Egypt</hi> and a <hi>Babel</hi> to Gods ſervants, oppreſſing them theſe one thouſand ſix hundred years, and not barely three years and a half: and in all this time God hath had witneſſes to his truth. The alluſion both to the places and the time is moſt elegant and comfortable. They that ſuffer with Chriſt, ſhall alſo reign with him.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, If the ſetling <hi>of the dayes</hi> one thouſand two hundred and ninetie, counting them ſo many years, as above, bee faultie, then Mr. <hi>Archers</hi> addition <hi>of</hi> fortie five <hi>yeares unto them,</hi> (which are the overplus of one thouſand three hundred thirtie five dayes, by him counted yeares, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.12.) muſt alſo be erroneous. Beſides Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> miſtakes by making thoſe fortie five years to be a time of great affliction to the Jews. For their welfare begins at the end of one thouſand two hundred and ninetie dayes, when <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is repaired, and the daily ſacrifice renewed: and a further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of happineſſe is made unto them fortie five dayes after. So that <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.11, 12. ſpeaks of the Jews welfare, not of their miſery; and fits their condition in <hi>Antiochus</hi> time exactly; for about fortie five dayes after <hi>Judas Maccabeus</hi> had cleanſed the Altar, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed thereon, <hi>Antiochus</hi> became extreamly ſick, and confeſſed how unjuſtly he had tyrannized over the Jews, 1 <hi>Macc.</hi> 6.8.9, &amp;c. and ſoon after in the next year died.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Mr. <hi>Archer</hi> affirmes that <hi>Julian</hi> was <hi>the ſetter up of the abomination of deſolation</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.11. Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> is of the ſame opinion on <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. Admit this to be true: then hee muſt alſo bee <hi>the taker away of the daily ſacrifice:</hi> for both theſe go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and have the ſame time aſoribed unto them. Now <hi>Julian</hi> was ſo farre from taking away the Jewiſh ſacrifices, that <hi>hee indeavoured to ſet them up, and did much countenance the Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Eccl. Hiſt.B.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, there is no reaſon why Mr. <hi>Archer</hi> ſhould hold that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dayes or years one thouſand two hundred and ninetie, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.11. the Jews ſhould bee cal'd to Chriſtianitle. The Text faith no ſuch thing: but tels how the Jews ſhould bee freed from two mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries; firſt, <hi>from the deſolation of Jeruſalem,</hi> ſecondly, <hi>from the taking away their daily ſacrifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e.</hi> Seeing theſe two are the miſeries befalling the Jews untill the end of the time there deſigned, they muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily fall in the time that ſacrifice was lawfull. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:112936:29"/>they muſt not bee in the daies of <hi>Titus,</hi> or of the Turk.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Theſe learned men ſwerve from the truth, by not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Chriſt at his being on earth, the ſtrong man, who bound Satan, and gave his Apoſtles power to tread on the Serpent, whoſe head himſelf brok, and whom hee made as lightning to fall from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven : ſo that from the time of Chriſts Aſcenſion the devill could not prevail to deceive all Nations, as before hee had don: but was looſed about a thouſand years afterward, as hath been decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red above.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, There is not any paſſage in the <hi>Revelation</hi> or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, that I know, from which it can bee proved, that the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy began in the year four hundred and ſix. Tis true, that about this time <hi>Conſtantine</hi> left <hi>Rome,</hi> and made <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Seat: but the Biſhop and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> did not then ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate, and degenerate from what they had been, that groſſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Antichriſtianiſm may bee laid to their charg. <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> who erected Churches, placed new Biſhops in them, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced other good Biſhops already placed; ſo held his Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all autority, and Vicegerency under Chriſt, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> never in his time exalted himſelf above the royall Scepter, or chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged an univerſall autority over all Churches. There were fault<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in Churches, and errours in Biſhops and teachers before <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> time, and in it. But <hi>wee ſee by Chriſts judgment upon the ſeven Churches in Aſia,</hi> Rev. 2. and 3. that ſome faults and errours do not preſently unchurch a people, as rank Popery and Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm doe.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, If <hi>the ten Kings received their kingdom,</hi> Apoc. 17.12. and imployed their power in oppreſſing the Church, together with the beaſt, namely, the perſecuting Emperours, then they received that their power from the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſars</hi> long before the year four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſix. And if it bee meant of receiving their power from the Popes, it is manifeſt that they ſubmitted not their necks, nor took their Scepters from the Popes, untill many years after four hundred and ſix, namely untill about the year of Chriſt one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and odde. Herein therefore Mr. <hi>Archers</hi> ground-work fails him.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, How can the year one thouſand two hundred and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bee attributed to the Pope alone? Suppoſe ſo <hi>many years given to the warring Beaſt,</hi> Rev. 13.4, 5. that is, the Emperours, which
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:112936:30"/>make the ſixth head, and <hi>the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ruled in Saint Johns time:</hi> I finde nor the like time aſcribed to the beaſt with two horns, or to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular type, whereby the Popes alone are expreſſed. Mr. <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> holds the beaſt, Rev. 13.1. not to bee the Emperours or ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill State of <hi>Rome,</hi> but the Popes: becauſe the Imperiall State was riſen before St. <hi>Johns</hi> time; and <hi>Chriſt ſhewed to Saint John, matters onely, which were to bee don after the giving of thoſe viſions,</hi> Rev. 4.1.</p>
               <p>To this I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Chriſt did ſhew St. <hi>John</hi> matters, which for the moſt part were to bee don after the Viſion, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. But hee ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him alſo, firſt, ſome things abſolutely don and paſt: as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>five of the heads of the Beaſt ſeen by John, were faln and gon,</hi> Rev. 17.11. Chriſt <hi>appeared to him as a Lamb that had been ſtain,</hi> Rev. 5.6. This was don long before that viſion And ſecondly, ſome things ſhewed to <hi>John</hi> were formerly in part fulfilled, and were yet more and more to bee fufillled in and after his time. As theſe, <hi>God doubtleſſe before ſat gloriouſly upon his Throne, as hee is ſaid to ſit.</hi> Rev. 4.2. The Elders, namely <hi>John</hi> himſelf and the other Apoſtles, and the whole Church of God, before <hi>Johns</hi> Viſions, <hi>aſcribed praiſe, honour, glory, &amp;c. to the Lamb,</hi> as they doe, Rev. 4. &amp; 5. <hi>The New Jeruſalem ſpoken of,</hi> Rev. 21.10. was before <hi>Mother of the beleeving Galatians, and other Chriſtians,</hi> Gal. 4.26. Heb. 12.22. I might inſtance in diverſe other the like paſſages. Obſerve this well, or els Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> will by a falſe fire miſlead you in diverſe other matters.</p>
               <p>Thirteenthly, Mr. <hi>Archer</hi> and ſome others, though they decline the groſſe millenary opinion of one thonſand years victory, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Joviality, yet in aſcribing to their refined thouſand years plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all things without ſin, and making the Martyrs raiſed from death, partakers thereof, &amp;c. palpably (as I conceive) miſtake. For <hi>the Kingdom of God is not meat and drink.</hi> nor (which is conſequent) other matters, leſſe neceſſary. And to what end ſhould the bodies of the Martyrs and Saints raiſed up immortall and glorified (ſuch they are deſcribed to bee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.) live again on earth to make uſe of ſuch poor accommodations, and not rather enjoy glory and immortality in heaven: for which the reſurrection fits them; as it did Chriſt riſen from the dead, and aſcending into heaven?</p>

And <hi>this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is ſaid to bee for one thouſand years,</hi> Rev. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes not, that Chriſts Kingdom was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his appearing to judg the quick and the dead: and Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> himſelf grants, <hi>That Chriſt long before had a crown given him, and rode firth, conquering and to conquer,</hi> Rev. 6.2. This hee judges to bee in the beginning of the Apocalypticall times. And that it was ſo, I have above proved. In the latter end of his Kingdom, <hi>Chriſt makes an abſolute conqueſt over the beaſt and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, I conceive the terms at <hi>his appearing, and in or at his kingdom,</hi> to bee in ſenſe, <hi>at his manifeſt appearing to bee the great King.</hi> And that the form of ſpeech is <hi>duobus pro uno poſitis,</hi> by putting two expreſſions for one.

                  <hi>Anſw: God is known by executing judgment, Pſalm</hi> 9.16. Not by the great and ſinall judgment onely, but by other particular judgments alſo on mankind. Some Jews might miſ-conceive of Gods dealing towards them; and be per ſwaded, that they ſhould in, or at Chriſts time get their necks from under the yoak of their oppreſſors. But when they ſaw Jeruſalem in that age ruined, many Jews cruelly ſlain, the reſt grievouſly diſperſt: how could they but think, and you now conceit, that God then ſate gloriouſly in judgment againſt them, who were grown <hi>as ſecure as they in the old world, Mat.</hi> 24.37. <hi>Luke</hi> 17.26.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Juſtin</hi> beleeves <hi>the reſurrection of the body;</hi> wee deny it not. But <hi>Juſtin</hi> aſſerts not two reſurrections, as ſome now doe, one a thouſand years before the other: <hi>Juſtin</hi> ſayes, that <hi>Jeruſalem ſhall bee re-edified, inlarged, adorned</hi> in ſuch ſenſe as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Eſay</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told: it is moſt true; A <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.10, &amp; <hi>Gal:</hi> 4.26: all the world over ſhall bee made a place of Gods worſhip (as was the old Jeruſalem) to the great joy of all people: <hi>the diſtinction of Jew and Gentile ſhall bee taken away, and all true Chriſtians ſhall bee the Iſrael of God, and true Jews:</hi> and ſhall have no need of the old Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem. How implicitly in <hi>Eſaies</hi> words, by <hi>Juſtin</hi> cited, the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years ſhould be pointed at, he is quickſighted, that can diſcern. No man (I think) endeavours now to prove the thouſand years from that text in <hi>Eſay.</hi> It there were any ſuch thing in <hi>Eſays</hi> words, Logick now, if ever, would work it out. Further, St: <hi>John</hi> ſayes not <hi>totidem verbis</hi> in expreſſe terms, what <hi>Iuſtin</hi> alledges: but that <hi>there ſhall be a new Ieruſalem comming down from heaven,</hi> not built by man; and <hi>that the Saints ſhall reign a thouſand years with Chriſt:</hi> and I will alſo grant, that this reign ſhould bee in the new Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. But that reign was in the beginning of the Goſpels times for a thouſand yeers, and ſhall not bee towards the end of the world: <hi>This Ieruſalem is mother of us all, of all the Iſrael of God, of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving Iews and Gentiles,</hi> in all times to the world end; and is not limited to old Jeruſalems ſeat, and ſome certain time. That king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom began long ſince, and was ſuch, as hath been above ſhewed, not ſuch as the pleaders for the thouſand yeers to come, deſcribe it.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> Divers of the Ancient Fathers, beſides <hi>Iuſtin Martyr,</hi> as <hi>Ireneus, Tertullian, Lactantius, Nepos,</hi> and others, held the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the thouſand yeers reign. <hi>Auſtine</hi> himſelf ſometime inclined
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:112936:33"/>to the ſame: and it ſeems to bee <hi>Ieroms</hi> prime Argument againſt it, that it ſavoured of Judaiſm: to reject this opinion, is a neglect of an ancient Tradition of the Church. <hi>Papias</hi> recommended it to the Fathers above, they to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The antiquity of this opinion, will be little warrant to the verity of it: if wee conſider that <hi>Ireneus</hi> ſayes, <hi>That</hi> Papias <hi>an Auditor of St.</hi> John <hi>aſſerted it:</hi> whereas <hi>Papias</hi> himſelf denies that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>hee ſaw or heard the Apoſtles.</hi> And <hi>Euſebius</hi> B: 3. <hi>Hiſtor: Eccleſ.</hi> ſayes, that <hi>Papias</hi> was too credulous, and of ſhallow judgment, and by miſ-interpreting Apoſtolicall expoſitions led others into errour; as <hi>Ireneus</hi> in this very point; and as ſome conceive, in the opinion of Antichriſts reign but for three years and an half near the worlds end.

                  <hi>Repl.</hi> Bee this opinion true or falſe, or whether the Fathers held an errour herein or no; to bee of the ſame minde with the Jews is not alwayes culpable. The Rabbins tell us, that the ſeventh mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenary is the great day of Judgment. That the world ſhall continue ſix thouſand years, and in the ſeventh thouſand bee deſtroyed with fire, and purified: and <hi>the Lord alone ſhall bee exalted in that day, Eſa.</hi> 2. that is, ſhall bee King over all the Earth. They ſay, that God in this millenary ſhall break the wicked; and that it ſhall bee a great Sabbath, or day of reſt. Other Rabbins hold, that the ſixt millenary ſhall be the day of Judgment. Rabbi <hi>Elias</hi> ſayes, that the world ſhould continue two thouſand yeers before the Law, two thouſand years under the Law, two thouſand under Chriſt.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No man holds the Jews in all things culpable. They are moſt carefull and vigilant preſervers of the originall Hebrew Text intire and uncorrupt: ſo that had not the Jews and Greeks been kept diſtinct people untill theſe times, the knowledge both of the Hebrew &amp; Greek originals had periſhed by the prevalency of Papiſtical dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. See my preface to <hi>Cognatio Linguarum.</hi> The Iews alſo, when they liſt to ſpeak out, ſhew good skill in the ſacred ſtories. Beſides many paſſages in their Talmuds about their rites and cuſtomes ſerve better to open ſome difficulties in the New Teſtament, then our Latine Commentaries. What I attribute to the knowledge lockt up in the Hebrew tongue, ſee in my Book <hi>Cognatio Linguarum. Poſit.</hi> 9. The <hi>Rabbins</hi> have many truths: but like good corne in much chaffe; themſelves often times ſo ſpeake, that they will tell you, <hi>Stultus credit omni verbo,</hi> it is ſillineſſe to take all they ſpeak for ſad truth. <hi>Maimonid. part</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 62. <hi>Schick.

Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latin.</hi> 1.7. Yet many ſuch riddles they have not worth the cracking their ſhell, and more like a deafe nut, then an wholſome Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat.

And whoever will hope to deale ſoundly with them (which would bee a glorious and heavenly work) for their converſion, muſt bee able to match and ſurpaſſe them, as in ſound knowledge of the Scripture, ſo in their own tongue and learning, as the Apoſtles and ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did the Greeks. Herein Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> did much, and had hee lived longer by good incouragement was both able and willing to have done far more.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the preſent queſtion obſerve the Jews jarring opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. <hi>Some of them hold the day of judgment, the wickeds breaking, and the Meſſias his exalting to bee at the end of the fift millenary;</hi> which is fully paſt: for I hold the world to be five thouſand five hundred ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventie one years old in this year one thouſand ſix hundred fortie foure; yet is not the one thouſand years by ſome conceived to bee begun. <hi>Some begin the great Sabbath at the end of the ſixt millenary:</hi> Such as live to it ſhall ſee how neer they come to the mark. <hi>Elias
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:112936:34"/>ſeems to hold, that the fift and ſixt millenary ſhall bee under Chriſt:</hi> and therefore, ſay I, by their own grounds, times of much happineſſe. I would they were ſo humble as to make uſe of them. There can be but one truth, ſome of theſe (to paſſe by others) muſt needs miſſe it, perhaps all of them: See how our writers vary from them. Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> begins the famous 1000. years in the three hundred year of Chriſt, Dr. <hi>Alſtede</hi> in one thouſand ſix hundred ninetie foure, Mr. <hi>Archer</hi> in one thouſand ſix hundred ſixtie ſix, or in one thouſand ſeven hundred. Others differ from theſe. This 'tis to grope after truth by a darke light, or no light at all; <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſaies well, <hi>It is better that a matter of which no certain demonſtration can be made, ſhould remain in doubt, then in vain to diſpute thereof.</hi> Mor.

                  <hi>Repl.</hi> A tradition agreeing with <hi>Rabbi Ketina's</hi> opinion of the worlds deſtruction in the ſeventh millenary, gives us a better ground for its truth; thus. After ſix years the Jews land and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had a ceſſation and reſt: ſo after that ſix thouſand years bee paſt, in the ſeventh thouſand years the world ſhall have a ceſſation and reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The uſe which God makes of the ſeventh years reſt in <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. is much different from that of the <hi>Rabbins;</hi> Namely, <hi>that the Iews might know that the Land was Gods, and they but ſojourners with him, Verſ.</hi> 23. <hi>That they might obſerve how God bleſſed them,</hi> when they in the ſeventh yeare labored not; and that it was hee that gave the encreaſe, when they did labour; and ſo depend on his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to them: It ſerved alſo to bring them to the ſeventh ſeven, and ſo come to the Jubilee, the famous year of reſt. So they might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conclude, that the world ſhould ſtand (but this alſo would bee but a ſandy foundation) fortie nine thouſand years, and then have a great Jubilee and reſt, in which the laſt Trumpet ſhould ſound, as in the Jubilee year the Jews Trumpets were wont to doe.</p>

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> The ancient Jews underſtood, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 2.11. and 17. of the great day of judgement: where it is ſaid, <hi>and the Lord alone ſhall be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that day.</hi> The later Iews ſpeak ſomething to the ſame purpoſe; and thence they ſay that the Lord ſhall be King over all the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In <hi>Eſay</hi> 2. is an excellent prophecie of the preaching of the Goſpel, and of the calling of the Gentiles by the Word going out from <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> This was fulfilled when God ſet up Chriſt his King on mount <hi>Sion,</hi> as I proved above.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:112936:35"/>years continuance. It is true, that when the Goſpel began to bee taught, <hi>Chriſt was by all true beleevers exalted alone, and preferred above all the high looks and loſtineſſe of men: many idolatrous and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious perſons then turned to Chriſt, and caſt away their ſilver and gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Idols,</hi> as there it is foretold. And if any unbeleevers ſaw not then Chriſts glory, they were juſtly to bee blamed. His glory was then ſuch, and hath ſo continued, that the gates of hell could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prevaile againſt it. It is true, that many worldly Potentates then ſtrove to exalt themſelves above Chriſt, and were highly exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by others; ſaying, Who is like this our Lord? who can war with him? But Chriſt in due time did manifeſt that theſe brags were vain and fooliſh: Becauſe Chriſt by overthrowing them, will ſhew his might to bee far above them, and that all their forces are inconſiderable. And at the day of judgment, when all quick and dead ſhall ſtand before him, all both ſmall and great ſhall ſee and conſeſſe him alone to bee exalted. But neither in <hi>Eſay</hi> 2. nor in the whole prophecie is there any ground for two reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and a day of judgment between them of a thouſand years continuance.</p>

               <p>AMong learned expoſiters many controverſies and doubts are moved about the two laſt Chapters of the <hi>Revelation:</hi> I will briefly handle that which eſpecially concerns the matter here to bee diſcuſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Many moſt excellent and admirable promiſes are made unto Chriſtians, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21. and 22. which muſt bee made good at one time or other. Many of them have not yet been fulfilled: therefore they are to bee fulfilled hereafter: and that muſt bee either in the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years of the Churches proſperitie, in which the Church and Saints of God ſhall reign with Chriſt before the end of the world, or elſe in the world to come in heaven. The promiſes are theſe, <hi>of new heavens and new earth, of a new Jeruſalem,</hi> of <hi>its being prepared and trimmed for Chriſt, the bus band thereof; of freedom from tears, death, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, pain; of all things made new,</hi> and many other the like. Read the Chapters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I grant that the promiſes in theſe two Chapters are for this life. And thus by ſeverall arguments I prove it. Firſt, the new <hi>Jeruſalem comes down from God out of heaven,</hi> and is on earth: if it were to bee in heaven, then it ſhould aſcend from earth to heaven, which it is not ſaid to doe. And this aſcending to God befals not Gods ſervants both in body and ſoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:112936:37"/>paſt: whereas in this life the <hi>Epheſians</hi> and other converts <hi>become fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Citizens with the Saints, Epheſ.</hi> 2.19. And ſecondly, there <hi>can bee no tears in heaven,</hi> which need <hi>to bee wiped away from the Saints eyes.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Tis on earth that the Saints thirſt,</hi> Revel. 21.6. and there <hi>Chriſt refreſhes them with the water of life,</hi> Joh. 4.14. In heaven they thirſt not, but are fully ſatisfied with all joy and pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. Then fourthly, <hi>the Nations that are ſaved,</hi> Revel. 1.24. <hi>walk.</hi> (a phraſe uſuall for converſing in this life) <hi>in the light of Chriſt, who is the light of the world, and glory of his people Iſrael,</hi> Luk. 2.32. And tis on earth, that Kings doe their ſervice to God, and <hi>bring their people to the New Jeruſalem,</hi> or the true Church. On earth are civill diſtinctions of Kings and people, of maſter and ſervant: but in heaven a <hi>Lazarus</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">

Rev. 22.2. and <hi>is the life of men in this world,</hi> 1 Ioh. 5.20. As hee is the ſpirituall Manna, ſo <hi>hee is the fruit of this tree every mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th fed upon by beleevers.</hi> Sixtly, The <hi>leaves of this tree ſerve to heale the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> Rev. 22.2. Now in heaven there is no account kept by moneths, nor are there any ſores of the Saints to bee healed, or that need cure. <hi>The ſoules of all faithfull are purified by faith in this life, Act.</hi> 15.9. And their bodies lie down, and leave, what was ſinfull and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in them, in the duſt of the grave, and riſing glorious and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall aſcend to heaven. Thus by theſe Arguments it appears, that the condition of Gods people in this life, is in theſe two Chapters declared.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I will ſhew, that many paſſages in theſe Chapters, which ſeem to belong to the Saints ſtate in heaven, expreſſe their happy condition not onely in the thouſand years from Chriſts time, but in all the dayes of the Goſpel to the worlds end: and thus I prove it. Firſt, <hi>Every one that is in Chriſt is a new creature:</hi> and not onely ſo: but <hi>all things are become new,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. This is anſwerable to Apoc. 21.5. And appears further thus. <hi>Chriſt is the ſecond or new Adam: hee maks new matters; floods in deſerts; them that were not his people to bee his people; be makes a new Covenant; ſpeaks to people by new tongues, gives them new hearts and new ſpirits; puts new wine into new bottles; gives beleevers a new name written in a white ſtone; clothes them with new garments; puts a new ſong into their mouths; makes a new heaven and a new earth, and a new Jeruſalem,</hi> that is, a Church of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:112936:38"/>both Jews and Gentiles. Theſe things began to bee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in Chriſts life time, and have been, are and will bee continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in fulfilling unto the worlds end. For all Chriſtians from the firſt to the laſt have their portion herein. Secondly, the marriage of Chriſt with the Chriſtian Church began with the preaching of the Goſpel: for then <hi>God made a marriage Feast, and invited gueſts unto it,</hi> Mat. 22.2. Joh. 3.29. Hee hath ever ſince, now doth, and will continue ſtill inviting them thereunto ſo long as the world laſts. <hi>Paul</hi> long ſince <hi>prepared the Corinthians a pure virgin for Chriſt their husband,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.2. The other Apoſtles and Religious Teachers ever ſince have endeavoured the ſame for other people and Nations. Thirdly, the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> Tabernacle of God was among men at the Goſpels beginning. Then <hi>Chriſt</hi>

                  <hi>bad his Tabernacle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, Job.</hi> 1.14. and became <hi>Immanuel</hi> God with us by aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming humane nature. This Tabernacle Chriſt took up with him to heaven at his aſcenſion. Beſides, as <hi>God had his dwelling or Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle among the Iſraelites,</hi> in the wilderneſſe and in <hi>Canaan:</hi> ſo <hi>Chriſt walks amidſt the golden Candleſticks, the Churches</hi> here on earth, Rev. 1. <hi>and on his throne hee ſits in the midſt of the Rulers</hi> of his Church, Rev: 5.6. and <hi>all Chriſtians did, doe, and ſhall acknowledge his glory, honour, dominion,</hi> to the worlds end; as <hi>they in that Chapter doe.</hi> Fourthly, the Covenant by which men of all Nations are Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and hee their God, <hi>Rev:</hi> 21. was made at the beginning of the Goſpel, and continues to bee made with all converts to the end of time: For God dwelt among the Corinthians, and by <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid unto them, <hi>I will bee your God, and ye ſhall bee my people,</hi> 2 Cor: 6.16. and <hi>hee is the ſame to every perſon of any Nation, that fears him,</hi> Acts 10.35. <hi>This Covenant is made with all that bee taught of God, and hear him,</hi> Jer: 31.33, 34. Iohn 6.45. And fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from the Chriſtian Churches beginning to the worlds end; <hi>All tears are wiped from the eyes of all beleevers, no death, ſorrow, crying, pain doth reſt on them, but paſſes away,</hi> Apoc: 21.4. So that <hi>if they weep</hi> (as men in affliction cannot but ſometimes doe) they (upon better conſideration) <hi>will bee as though they wept not,</hi> 1 Cor: 7,31. <hi>They ſuffer tribulation, but they come out of it, and by the Lamb of God are filled full of all joy and comfort,</hi> Rev: 17.14. There will bee wicked men, who <hi>with their tongues</hi> will calumniate, and <hi>with their weapons</hi> wound them: <hi>but their malice ſhall not proſper in the end: They themſelves ſhall fall; becauſe Gods Covenant of mercy and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:112936:38"/>peace ſhall never fail his people;</hi> Eſa: 54.10. &amp;c: <hi>Hence the Saints are bidden, when perils are at hand, not to fear,</hi> Acts 27.24. <hi>not to fear the fear of the wicked,</hi> 1 Pet: 3.14. <hi>God being their helper, they need not fear what man can doe unto them,</hi> Heb: 13.6. Yea tears ſhall bee ſo wiped away, and pain ſo allayed, that <hi>they ſhall count it exceeding joy, that they fell into temptations and afflictions,</hi> Jam: 1.1. <hi>Their ſorrow is in the iſſue turned into joy, which no man can take from them,</hi> Joh: 16.20. This is of force ſufficient to wipe off all tears. For <hi>they ſhall have aſſurance by their faith in the Lamb, and in his blood, and by their teſtimony given unto Gods truth, to overcome,</hi> Mat: 28.8. Rev: 12.11.</p>
               <p>I might goe on, and further inſtance in other particulars, which ſubſerve, and are fitted unto theſe already ſpoken of. In brief, I will collect them, and ſay no more, but what may point at them in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſeeing the old Jeruſalem is ruined, <hi>God builds a new one the mother of all faithfull Chriſtians, both Jews and Gentiles; and this must needs bee a great and capacious City, having glorious foundations and walls,</hi> to bee ſtrong for defence, <hi>and have gates on each ſide of it,</hi> for acceſſe thereunto from the foure coaſts of heaven.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>if the twelve Patriarchs of old had their names graven in pearls and jewels, and born by Aaron a type of Christ,</hi> the upholder of all the faithfull, for the comfort of each godly perſon in the twelve Tribes: much more <hi>may the names of the twelve Apoſtles bee ſet upon the twelve foundations</hi> of this glorious City, for the comfort of all ſuch, as are begotten children to Chriſt by them and their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if <hi>Gods Law was eſteemed by David walking therein, above gold, above the fineſt gold,</hi> and thouſands of it: then doubtleſſe, <hi>the ſtreets of the New Jeruſalem,</hi> in which all good Chriſtians walk, <hi>may very well bee compared to gold, as pure and clear, as glaſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>the Tabernacle and Temple of old glittered with golden ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, and the choicest gems:</hi> the Chriſtian Church comes not ſhort of either of them: but is, as every man muſt needs grant, far more glorious in all reſpects, hath more excellent and ſpirituall priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and clear and comfortable doctrine far beyond all former times. As the Tents for Gods people are inlarged, and their curtains fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpread then of old, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 54.2. So are Gods favours more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the Chriſtian Church, then formerly to the Jewiſh.</p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:112936:39"/>
               <p>Fifthly, If <hi>David was the light of Iſrael,</hi> and by his high eſteem of <hi>Gods word the light to mens paths,</hi> made his people to walk ſafely in that light: much more now is <hi>Chriſt the David,</hi> or beloved of God, and the light of the world, and directs Chriſtians to come out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto the ſaving Truth. Theſe and other matters moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſpoken of the Churches eſtate in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. &amp; 22. are belonging to the Church of God in this life.</p>
               <p>Nor need any man to admire that the high and heavenly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, in theſe two Chapters uſed, concern the eſtate of the Chriſtian Church in this life.</p>
               <p>For, firſt, <hi>the faithfull in their life time have <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> an exhibition or ſubſiſtence of things hoped for,</hi> of the happineſſe promiſed them for life to come. <hi>They have <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> a ſummary inventory of things not yet ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11.1. that is, <hi>of the inheritance immortall, and undefiled, and that fades not away, but is reſerved for them in Heaven,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. The eye of faith is quickſighted, and beholds things afar off, as preſent. Hereby <hi>Abraham</hi> in his dayes ſaw and enjoyed Chriſt, and redemption by him: and <hi>Moſes (</hi> which is much more) ſaw him that is inviſible. Thus a Chriſtian may in this life by faith ſee, take comfort in, and rejoyce moſt heartily in the glorious eſtate of the life to come, and (as wee uſe to ſay) have an heaven upon earth; whence it is, that the Church on earth is called Heaven. Of which hereafter I ſhall ſpeak.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the comforts, joyes, bleſſings of Gods people in this life are exceeding abundant, <hi>his gifts <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </gap> things an hundred fold better,</hi> Mat. 19.29. And if <hi>Paul count all things dung in compariſon of Jeſus Chriſt, and the enjoying of him:</hi> the old Jeruſalems richly beautified Temple, the reſplendent Jewels in the new Jeruſalems walls and gates com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, the gold tranſparent as glaſſe, with which the ſtreets are pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; the Cry ſtall rivers, the fruitfull trees, with which the City is furniſhed and adorned, cannot fully and to the life ſet forth the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull glory of Gods Church in this life. Let what can bee ſaid <hi>of the Kings daughter, Chriſts Spouſe, of the Churches excellency from outward matters,</hi> Pſal. 45. in the Song of ſongs, and elſwhere, this addition, <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> is all glorious within,</hi> ſurpaſſes all; So there is an
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:112936:39"/>ward beauty, a ſpirituall glory ſuperadded to the outward excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Church that goes beyond the higheſt ſtrains that can by words bee uttered. Let but the ſaving knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, the enjoyment of his favour, the comforts of the holy Ghoſt, which in this life muſt bee gotten by them that hope to enjoy his preſence in the other world, bee put into the ballance againſt all worldly matters, to whoſe luſtre alluſion is ſo often made in theſe two Chapters: they are of more weight, and greater worth, then all ſuch outward things. Wherefore the lofty and ſtately expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in theſe Chapters, cannot be denyed to belong to the Chriſtian Church, of which Chriſt is the light, from his being here on earth, untill he give up his government of the ſame at the laſt day, and take up with him his ſervants to thoſe heavenly manſions, which he hath prepared for them.</p>

               <head>Chap. VIII. <hi>whether the binding of Satan for a thouſand yeers bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready paſt. The Queſtion ſtated.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Angels, which in the beginning of the world fell from their happy condition, <hi>were eaſt down into</hi> Tartarus, <hi>and were there reſerved in everlaſting chains under darkneſſe, to the judgment of the great day, Jude 6.</hi> Therefore they are at all times ſo bound that they cannot work any miſchief to man without eſpeciall commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God; who gives them liberty, and looſes their chain, ſo far onely as to him ſeems good. This ſometimes God doth, and that either <hi>for triall of the godly, as in Jobs caſe;</hi> or for <hi>to humble them, as when Paul was buffeted by Satans Meſſenger,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.7. Or <hi>for puniſhment of the wicked,</hi> as <hi>when Ahab bent to believe falſe Prophets, was deceived by a lying Spirit,</hi> 1 Kings 22. or upon ſome other the like caſes. Of this reſtraint and looſing of Satan the queſtion is not.</p>
               <p>Scripture informs us further; Firſt, of an eminent and notable binding up of Satan for a thouſand years after Chriſts time, in the Abyſſe or bottomleſſe pit; wherein hee is ſo faſt ſealed up, that hee
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:112936:40"/>cannot deceive the Nations. Secondly, of an eminent and manifeſt looſing him, after the thouſand yeers are ended. After which time hee works much miſchief againſt Gods people, and draws the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in all coaſts of the world into combuſtions of war.</p>
               <p>The controverſie here is, whether this notable binding up of Satan bee already paſt, or yet to come? This I am now to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="9" type="chapter">
               <head>Chap. IX. <hi>The famous and notable binding up of Satan is already paſt, and is not yet to come.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THis poſition I thus prove: <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. The famous kingdom of Chriſt and Chriſtians, and this notable binding up of Satan for a thouſand years begin both together. Dr. <hi>J. Alſtede,</hi> Mr. <hi>J. Mede,</hi> Mr. <hi>Archer,</hi> The Glimpſe joyntly hold this undeniable.</p>
               <p>But the famous Kingdome of Chriſt and Chriſtians began moe years then one thouſand five hundred agon, as I have above pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>Therefore the notable binding up of Satan began one thouſand five hundred years agon, and therefore is paſt long before our time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Hee that did in eminent manner by the Spirit and finger of God caſt out devils, and did <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>annul</hi> and undo the works of the devill, and ſpoyled him of his power, <hi>did firſt eminently bind Satan, Matth.</hi> 12.29. <hi>Luk</hi> 11.20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Chriſt at his being on earth above one thouſand five hundred years agon did in eminent manner by the Spirit and finger of God caſt out devils, and annull and undo the works of Satan, and ſpoyle him of his power.</p>
               <p>Therefore Chriſt then bound Satan, as above, in an eminent manner.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Chriſts caſting out of devils</hi> is often mention made in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels: as <hi>Luk</hi> 11.10. and elſewhere; and <hi>this hee did in ſuch manner, that all man were aſtonied thereat,</hi> Matth. 9.33. Mark 1.27. <hi>and never ſaw it in the like manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:112936:40"/>
               <p>That Chriſt did annull and undoe the works of the devill, and take from him his power, is manifeſt. The <hi>devill was the Prince of darkneſſe, Chriſt was the light of the world,</hi> Joh. 1.9. <hi>The devill blinded the minds of unbeleevers: Chriſt commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, and gave the Nations knowledg of himſelf, and the Goſpel,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.4. <hi>The devill caught men in his ſnares: Chriſt by bringing men to repentance and faith freed them from thoſe ſnares,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. <hi>Zacheus of a Publican and ſinner,</hi> and loſt man, <hi>was by Chriſt made a ſon of Abraham,</hi> Luk 19. So were other the like converts. <hi>The Epheſians were children of wrath, as other Gentiles, and walked according to the Prince that rules in the ayre or darkneſſe: but Chriſt inlightned the eyes of their underſtanding, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them by grace, ſaved them through faith,</hi> Epheſ. 1.2. <hi>The devill drew men at firſt into ſin, and thereby brought</hi> (as other calamities, ſo) <hi>death on mankind:</hi> but <hi>Chriſt by his death deſtroyed him that had the power of death, that is, the devill,</hi> Heb. 2.14. <hi>and tooke away the ſting of death,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.55. So that <hi>Satan did but bruiſe Chriſts heele; Chriſt cruſhed Satans head.</hi> Thus Chriſt did overpower and conquer Satan in thoſe primitive times, as the Texts cited ſhew.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. <hi>Chriſt hath already become the head of all principalitie and power, and ſpoyled them and made a ſhew openly, and triumphed over them,</hi> Coloſſ. 2.10. and 15. <hi>and being raiſed from death, ſate on Gods right hand, and was above all principalities, and powers and dominions, and had all things ſubject to him, and under his feet,</hi> Epheſ. 1.20, 21.</p>
               <p>Therefore Satan was then alſo conquered and triumphed over by Chriſt: for hee was the grand Boutifeu and chieſe enemie of Chriſt, and was by Chriſt impriſoned and laid faſt up in chaines, as conquerors deale with the ringleaders of ſuch as with hoſtilitie op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. <hi>The 70. Diſciples ſent forth by Chriſt ſubdued devils by Chriſts name:</hi> and <hi>Chriſt thereupon tels them, that hee ſaw Satan fall from heaver as lightning:</hi> and <hi>then did Chriſt give to his diſciples power to tread on Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents and Scorpions, and all power of the enemy, ſo that nothing could hurt them,</hi> Luk 10.18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which purpoſe alſo wee read, 1 Joh. 5.18 that <hi>the evill one cannot touch them, that are born of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore in the primitive times one thouſand five hundred years agon the devill was bound, and in eminent manner reſtrained by Chriſt.</p>

               </head>
               <p>HOwever the arguments in the former Chapter ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the truth; ſome there are who will not be ſatisfied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: I will therefore anſwer, what they produce to aſſert the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object. How was Satan bound</hi> (ſay they) <hi>when all the Apoſtles were perſecuted, Chriſts ſubjects diſtreſſed and deſtitute of all comforts, and moſt of them cruelly put to death? Gl. pag. 9.</hi> had not Satan a manifeſt hand and plot herein, and indevored hereby to hinder, if not to extirpate the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Satan was long agon caſt down by <hi>Michael</hi> or Chriſt, and ſubdued, as is above proved: and ſeeing then hee could not doe the miſchiefe hee deſired to Gods Saints, and hinder the advancing of the Goſpel: hee Rev. 13. <hi>gave his power and throne and great authority to the ten horned beaſt,</hi> the Roman Tyrants, who by their agents and friends then murthered the Apoſtles and Saints of God. Secondly, though the ſervants of God were perſecuted and put to violent deaths; yet Chriſt having conquered death, <hi>its ſting was taken away;</hi> ſo that it was but a paſſage for them to a better life, and to endleſſe bliſſe. Thirdly, Chriſt when it ſo pleaſed him, did often deliver his ſervants from dangerous perſecutions, and from death it ſelf, As namely, <hi>Peter ſtrictly watcht in priſon,</hi> Act. 12.7. and <hi>Paul, when fattie perſons had ſworn not to eat or drink untill they had kild him,</hi> Act 23.12. and then onely did God permit them to bee ſlain, when they had finiſhed their courſe, and might beſt glorifie God by their deaths, which they underwent willingly, couragiouſly comfortably. So that as formerly their lives, ſo now their deaths made the Goſpel greatly to bee taken notice of, and to bee glorified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object. Satan is cold the Prince of the ayre, who works in the children of diſobedience,</hi> Epheſ. 2.2. Hee is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a ruler of the world in darkneſſe here beneath, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.12. The comming of the man of ſin is by the works of Satan with ſignes and lying wonders, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.9. Therefore Satan was not in the primitive times
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:112936:41"/>bound, chain'd, and ſealed up the bottomleſſe pit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That which in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. is termed <hi>the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> is in other notions cald <hi>Earth and Sea,</hi> Rev. 12.12. and <hi>aire or darkneſſe;</hi> Epheſ. 2.2. <hi>The aire,</hi> ſaith Philo Jud. <hi>is black and dark of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and is cald <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> darkneſſe.</hi> Hence the devill is ſtiled the Prince of the ayre and of darkneſſe. The Sea and Earth alſo have no light of themſelves, but from above. When therefore it is ſaid, the devill hath power in the ayre, earth, or ſea, by theſe are meant men of dark, earthly, and unquiet minds. In which ſenſe it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.12. <hi>Woe bee to the inhabitants of the earth and Sea,</hi> for Satan being by Chriſt caſt out of the heaven of the Church, hee came amongſt the inhabitants of the Ayre, Sea, and Earth, that is, men who were not heavenly minded. The affinitie of theſe terms appears, firſt, becauſe the <hi>Beaſt which</hi> Apoc. 13.1. <hi>is ſaid to riſe out of the Sea,</hi> is <hi>ſpoken of</hi> Apoc. 9.7. <hi>as aſcending out of the bottomleſſe pit:</hi> And ſecondly, there is a <hi>Tehom,</hi> an Abyſſe or bottomleſſe pit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.20. <hi>aſcribed to the Earth,</hi> as elſwhere to the Sea. Now <hi>when Satan was caſt down from domineering in the Church, and had his ſpeciall abode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong wicked men, hee ſet up, firſt, the ten horned Beast,</hi> Revel. 13.1. <hi>to blaſpheme the name of God, to war with, to overcome and kill Gods people.</hi> And ſecondly, <hi>hee ſet up the Beaſt with two horns, Verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>who did the works of the firſt Beaſt, and did alſo deceive the world with ſignes and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonders, Verſ.</hi> 13,14. for this ſecond Beaſt expreſſes fully <hi>the man of ſin, who</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.9. is deſcribed <hi>by his falſe and commerfeit wonders:</hi> What miſchief Satan bound by Chriſt could not then work by himſelf, hee endeavoured to act by theſe two his wicked inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Suppoſe it bee denied, that heaven in Scripture at any time ſignifies the Church, and that Earth, Sea, and Aire denote wicked, blind, and unquiet worldlings, how can the contrary bee proved?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is thus proved; Firſt, <hi>The diſciples are called the lights of the world,</hi> Matth. 5.14. <hi>The godly Philippians muſt ſhine in the world as lights,</hi> Phil. 2.15. <hi>When the teachers of ſacred doctrine in the Church were puld down, the Stars are ſaid to fall from heaven,</hi> Dan. 8.10. Rev. 9.1. <hi>The Angels or chiefe teachers of the Church are cald Stars,</hi> Revel. 1.20. Therefore the Church is the heaven in which they move, and ſhine, and from which their light and influence proceeds, to take men off from their worldly eſtate. Secondly, Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:112936:42"/>
                  <hi>Sancti &amp; juſti coelum vocantur,</hi> holy and juſt men are called Heaven, <hi>De civ: Deilib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 21. and expounds that in Mal. 4. <hi>leſt I come and deſtroy the earth,</hi> of the wicked upon the Earth, <hi>qui terrena ſapiunt,</hi> who mind earthly things, <hi>Ib. c.</hi> 29. His judgment herein is ſound, becauſe wee finde the members of Chriſts Church called heaven, <hi>Rev:</hi> 12.11. where <hi>the heavens and they that dwell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> that is, <hi>ſuch as overcome by the blood of the Lamb, are bid to rejoyce.</hi> And on the contrary <hi>the inhabitants of the earth</hi> are expounded to bee ſuch as <hi>have not their names written in the book of life,</hi> Rev. 12.9. Thus what was denyed, I conceive, is ſufficiently proved. Many learned Expoſiters give their aſſent hereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl. The caſting down of Satan to the earth, and excluding him from heaven,</hi> Apoc. 12. and <hi>Satans binding, ſhutting, and ſealing up in the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> Rev. 20. are ſo far from expreſſing one and the ſame thing in different notions (which ſome Expoſiters think they doe) that there is no one word the ſame in both, 1 The <hi>Angel binding Satan,</hi> Apoc. 20, <hi>came from heaven:</hi> but <hi>Michael</hi> in Chap. 12: <hi>fights with the Dragon in Heaven.</hi> 2 Concerning Satan, <hi>be is</hi> 1 <hi>taken,</hi> 2 <hi>bound,</hi> 3 <hi>ſhut up,</hi> 4 <hi>ſealed up,</hi> Chap: 20.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, in generall I anſwer, the ſame thing is often in the Revelation expreſſed in a different manner. As namely, firſt, <hi>Chriſt</hi> Rev: 1. <hi>appeares to St.</hi> John <hi>in</hi> Patmos <hi>after a glorious manner, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the ſeven golden Candleſticks.</hi> In Chap: 5. <hi>hee appears on a Throne in the midſt of twenty four Elders, as a Lamb that had been ſlain.</hi> And Chap: 6.2. <hi>hee is ſeen on a white Horſe armed and crowned, and riding with conqueſt.</hi> Secondly, uſually when divers viſions run upon one matter in the Revelation, what is omitted, or not ſo clearly expreſſed in one, is more fully and plainly opened in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: that ſo the whole matter intended may reſult from the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall viſions compared together. Hence Rev: 1.7. <hi>the godly, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the knowledg of Chriſt crucified for their ſins, lament and waile.</hi> But Chap: 12.12. <hi>upon Chriſts conqueſt over Satan they rejoyce.</hi> And Chapter 15.2, 3. <hi>they harp and ſing as Moſes and Iſrael,</hi> having paſſed ſafe thorow the red Sea in which the Egyptians were drowned. M. <hi>Mede</hi> himſelf grants that divers viſions in the <hi>Apoc.</hi> do <hi>relegere,</hi> run over again, and expreſſe one and the ſame thing in a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Clavis Apoc: part</hi> 2. <hi>Proem:</hi> So Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> on Apoc: 11.1. Many Expoſitors unanimouſly agree herein.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:112936:42"/>
               <p>Secondly, in particular I anſwer, <hi>Chriſt is the Angell of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> Mal. 3.1. <hi>That came down from heaven,</hi> Joh. 6.38. Apoc. 20.1. Hee being on Earth, and the chief Ruler of the Heaven on earth, that is, his Church; (This expoſition I have above confirmed) hee, I ſay, I <hi>fought with Satan,</hi> 2 <hi>conquered him,</hi> 3 <hi>excluded him from heaven,</hi> 4 <hi>caſt him into the earth and Sea.</hi> This Chriſt doth under the name of <hi>Michael,</hi> Chap. 12. His fighting with and conqueſt over Satan intimates that the Dragon was taken, and as a captive of moſt malice bound, faſt ſhut up, and chained. The caſting of the Dragon into the Earth and Sea, and his excluſion from heaven fully expreſſe his binding and confining to the bottomleſſe pit. How Earth and Sea are anſwerable to the Abyſſe or bottomleſſe pit, I have formerly ſhewed. Evident it is, that theſe bee forms of ſpeech which <hi>humanitus loquendo,</hi> after the manner of men, ſet forth one and the ſame thing, namely, Gods reſtraining Satan. And hence it appears how the twelve and twenty Chapters in divers manner, and ſomewhat different notions expreſſe the ſame reſtraint of Satan, and how each Chapter helps to the more clear underſtanding of the other. Many good Expoſitors judge them ſo to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object. Satan was not bound in the time of the ſix former Seals, and ſix former Trumpets. For in the time of the ſix former Seals, hee was in B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Therefore Satan was not bound in the time of the ſix former Seals; and in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Trumpets time. And in Trumpet five is not Satan looſe?

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. Satan is not by Chriſt to bee bound for a thouſand years, untill the Beaſt and falſe prophet bee caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone: for Saint John ſaw the Beaſt and falſe prophet, Chap.</hi> 19. <hi>caſt into that lake, and then afterward Chap.</hi> 20. <hi>Satan bound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Beaſt and falſe prophet are not yet caſt into that Lake: the Secular and Eccleſiaſticall power of Rome ſtill exiſts and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues in the Pope and his ſubſtitutes. Therefore Satan is not yet taken, bound, ſhut and ſealed up by Chriſt. This objection is Dr. <hi>Alſteds</hi> and the others joyntly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Revelation declares, what <hi>John</hi> in order ſaw, not what ſhould in order continuedly and ſucceſſively bee acted. This truth in generall Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> approves, though hee ſtarts from it in this particular: <hi>Clav. part.</hi> 2. <hi>Synch.</hi> 4. The reaſons which drew him to this miſtake are above anſwered: I ſay then, that Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaw the viſion <hi>of Chriſts conqueſt over the Beaſt and falſe prophet,</hi> and how <hi>they were caſt into hell,</hi> before hee ſaw <hi>the viſion of Satans binding and ſealing up, and of his looſing and caſting into the fiery lake.</hi> Yet might Satan bee bound in the Abyſſe, and therein incite the Sea Beaſt, the wicked Emperours; and Earth Beaſt, the falſe prophet, (for both Sea-beaſts and Earth-Beaſts have their Abyſſe, as above) to doe miſchief, and both they and hee bee at once caſt into the lake of ſire. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> judiciouſly ſayes in the end of the <hi>Clavis, Corol. the</hi> 2. that <hi>as in hiſtories, ſo in viſions divers matters don at one and the ſame time, are not told at one and the ſame time, but one after another: and that they will miſpend their pains, who tie the events of matters mentioned in the Apocalyps to the ſeries</hi> and order <hi>of the viſions.</hi> The obſervation is of very great uſe; and proves true often in the Revelation. Saint <hi>John</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:112936:44"/>after that hee ſaw <hi>the viſion of the ſealed book,</hi> Rev. 5. and 6. <hi>ſaw the book open,</hi> Rev. 10. yet <hi>the propheſie of the open book</hi> (according to Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> and others) <hi>begins its accompliſhment at the very entrance of the Apocalyps times, where the ſealed books time alſo begins.</hi> So <hi>the viſion of the two witneſſes who prophecie one thouſand two hundred and ſixtie dayes, is related,</hi> Chap. 11. before <hi>the viſion, in which the Beaſt,</hi> Rev. 13.1. <hi>exerciſes the dragons power fortie two moneths:</hi> yet Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> rightly (though I approve not his ſetling their beginnings) makes them contemporary. In like manner the Beaſt, falſe prophet and the dragon may bee all at one and the ſame time caſt into the lake of fire, and not Satans two chief inſtruments a thouſand and moe years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore himſelf: though one in viſion bee related before the other. Nor indeed doth the originall, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.10. ſay, as ſome urge it, that the Dragon was caſt into the lake, where the Beaſt and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>are</hi> or <hi>were;</hi> or <hi>are</hi> or <hi>were caſt:</hi> but <hi>were ſeen to bee caſt</hi> by <hi>John</hi> as in Chap. 19.19, 20. The words and context will bear this ſenſe very well.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Satan was ſo bound and reſtrained by Chriſt, that <hi>the Church from Chriſts time to Pope</hi> Hildebrands <hi>ſtood in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different eſtate of truth, and then began Religion to bee turned upſide down,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fox Martyrol. Pref. p.</hi> 5. So that about ſix hundred years agon, Superſtition and errour ſpread it ſelf, the ſacred Scriptures were laid aſide, the originall Texts unregarded, niceties broached, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies handled moſtly by ſchool diſputes without Scripture; the Popes Supremacy was advanced, the people were generally kept in darkneſſe, and made to ſerve dumbe Idols, and worſhip Images. Theſe things could proceed from no other, but from the Prince of darkneſſe, who then being looſe, incited the Angell of the bottomleſſe pit, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> with groſſe and thick ſmoak of Hereſies, to darken the ſun and aire, which Chriſt had inlightned with clear truth. By this means the Leaders of the people being blind, led their blind followers into the ditch.</p>
               <p>Secondly, about a thouſand years after Chriſt, <hi>Sylveſter</hi> obtained the Popedome by Sorcery, and the finger of the Devill. About that time the Clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> began to wring from the Emperour the election of the Pope: then was <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour accuſed of Hereſie, and of diminiſhing the autority of the Sea of <hi>Rome. Robert Guiſeard</hi> was ſet up Generall (the ſpirituall Sword was not keen enough to maintain their cauſe) to conquer the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and make them obedient to the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> In theſe times <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> or <hi>Helbrand</hi> (as ſome call him) ſhewed the height of his proud heart, and over-ruled as Pope indeed, before hee was Pope in place or name: for hee did beat the Pope, and compelled him to do, whatever he pleaſed and ever ſtood out againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours autority. And when this <hi>Hildebrand</hi> had ſetled himſelf in the Popes chair, hee depoſed the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and diſcharged the people of their Allegiance. Hee made <hi>Otho</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> as alſo <hi>Rodulp</hi> King of <hi>Sweden</hi> to raiſe war againſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and to attempt the depriving him of his Empire. So that Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> ſaith, <hi>That hereby this</hi> Hildebrand <hi>diſquieted the peace of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By his example his Succeſſors were inſected with ambition, pride, tyranny, ſtoutneſs, diſobedience to their Emperours lawfull Autority.</hi> So that Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Popes after this</hi> Hildebrand, <hi>imitated him, on the Kings of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael did idolatrous Jeroboam.</hi> Whereupon the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> ſaid, <hi>that Hildebrand ruled not by the Spirit of God, but of Satan.</hi> It ſeems
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:112936:47"/>that they ſaw Satan looſe in him and his practiſes. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> that proudly ſet his foot on the Emperour <hi>Fredericks</hi> neck, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the wicked acts of this <hi>Hildebrand.</hi> Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> ſaid, that this <hi>Frederick</hi> claimed homage of the Popes, required it of them that were Gods, and Sons of the high God. In brief the Popes in theſe times did ſo domineer that Kings could doe little in their own Realms: becauſe the Popes exalted themſelves, and to get'a bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe autority, took away all unity and concord. Not <hi>England</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and moſt parts of the weſtern world felt this to their ſmart, had their Eſtates impoveriſhed by large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions, and heavy exactions at the Popes pleaſure, and their blood lamentably and profuſely exhauſted in the wars for the holy Land (as the Pope ſtiled them) and in other combuſtions. So that Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> averres, that <hi>theſe courſes were taken to weaken and bring low Princes, and to advance and inrich the Popes.</hi> And that the reſtleſſe ſpirits of Romaniſts, and eſpecially of the later ſprung brood of the Jeſuites, more violent then ever, have raiſed grievous combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Church, there is ſcarce any eye ſo dim, that doth not clearly diſcern. Thus it appears that Satan was looſed about ſix hundred years agon, and then deceived the world, as of old: and that by the means of Romaniſts grievous Wars and bloudſhed have broken forth, which may well bee tearmed the wars of Gog. And ſo the learned <hi>H. Bullinger</hi> eſteems them, and more ſully relates the miſeries of thoſe wars. Of the ſame minde is the judicious D. <hi>Paraeus,</hi> and others. In thoſe Wars many of Gods Saints were vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Popes pride, exalting himſelf above Chriſtian Princes, were much afflicted, injured and ſlain: the like may bee ſaid of other Wars, which have ſucceeded them for the holy Land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> The expreſſe words, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.3. are <hi>that Satan ſhall bee loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed but for a ſhort time,</hi> in which hee deceives the Nations, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes the wars of Gog, which compaſſe the holy City.

               <p>Secondly, Five, or ſix, or ſeven hundred years may bee termed a a ſhort time of the Churches ſufferings, if they bee compared with the eternall bliſſe, that Gods people ſhall enjoy after their miſeries in this life are ended. In the like ſenſe <hi>the afflictions of Gods Servants in this life, how great ſoever, are termed light and momentary in regard of the moſt excellent and eternall weight of glory in the life to come,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.17.</p>
               <p>And, thirdly, ſo many years in regard of the thouſand years of Satans reſtraint are a ſhorter time, and may bee termed a ſhort time with reſpect to the thouſand years: In this ſenſe Dr. <hi>Alſtede</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and ſome others take them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Chriſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>Behold I come ſhortly, or quickly, Rev.</hi> 22.20. and yet is not hee come to make an end of the world, as there of revealing matters from the Primitive times to the worlds end in which ſpace one thouſand ſix hundred years are already paſt. Thus ſix hundred years and moe may bee termed a ſhort time: Mr. <hi>Archer</hi> here erres againſt plain Scripture, Gogs wars ſhall not bee a ſudden and ſhort hurry, not much harmfull to Gods Saints; For God tells us, that <hi>Satans rage ſhall bee fierce, becauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Gogs wars are in the four Coaſts of the Earth, and are ſo great and furious, that God comes down himſelf to put an end to them, and to vanquiſh and puniſh the Autor and Inſtruments of the War. Wherefore D. <hi>Alſtede</hi> more ſoundly holds, that in theſe wars will be a grievous and lamentable afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> If the wars of Gog and Magog have already laſted ſo long, as you conceive, then ſurely they cannot bee far from their end, and the laſt and finall judgment muſt be near at hand: But it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that <hi>there ſhall bee a time of great proſperity of the Church in all matters not ſinfull, Arch. pag.</hi> 3. and that the ſame time ſhould begin within ſome few years, and continue many hundreth years before the laſt day of judgment. And that the Jews alſo ſhall be called, and enjoy thoſe happy times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is very probable, that the day of judgment is neer. For firſt, there <hi>hath</hi> been (as was foretold, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.) <hi>a departure front the true Religion,</hi> and that moſt conſpicuous and manifeſt about a
