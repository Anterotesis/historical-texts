            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ESSAY IN Political Arithmetick, BY <hi>Sir</hi> WILLIAM PETTY,</head>
            <p>Tending to prove that <hi>London</hi> hath more People and Housing than the Cities of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Rouen</hi> put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and is also more considerable in several other respects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE Medium of the <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials</hi> at <hi>London</hi> in the three last years, <hi>viz,</hi> 1683, 1684 and 1685, (wherein there was no extraordinary Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60342:4"/>
and wherein the <hi>Christenings</hi> do correspond in their ordinary proportions with the <hi>Burials</hi> and <hi>Christenings</hi> of each year one with another) was 22337, and the like Medium of <hi>Burials</hi> for the three last <hi>Paris</hi> Bills we could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, <hi>viz.</hi> for the years 1682, 1683 and 1684 (whereof the last as appears by the <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> to have been very sickly) is 19887.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The City of <hi>Bristol</hi> in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> appears to be by good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimate of its <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Customes</hi> as great as <hi>Rouen</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and the City of <hi>Dublin</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have more Chimnies than <hi>Bristol,</hi> and consequently more People, and the <hi>Burials</hi> in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60342:4"/>
               <hi>Dublin</hi> were <hi>Anno</hi> 1682 (being a sickly year) but 2263.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Now the <hi>Burials</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> (being 19887) being added to the <hi>Burials</hi> of <hi>Dublin</hi> (supposed more than at <hi>Rouen</hi>) being 2263, makes but 22150, whereas the <hi>Burials</hi> of <hi>London</hi> were 187 more, or 22337, or as about 6 to 7.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If those who die unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and by miscarriage in <hi>L'ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stel Dieu</hi> in <hi>Paris</hi> (being above 3000) as hath been elsewhere shewn, or any part thereof, should be subtracted out of the <hi>Paris Burials</hi> aforementioned, then our assertion will be stronger, and more proportionable to what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60342:5"/>
concerning the Housing of those Cities, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. There were burnt at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Anno</hi> 1666, above 13000 houses, which being but a fifth part of the whole, the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of houses in the said year, were above 65000; and whereas the ordinary <hi>Burials</hi> of <hi>London</hi> have increased between the years 1666 and 1686, above <hi>one third,</hi> the total of the houses at <hi>London Anno</hi> 1686, must be about 87000, which <hi>Anno</hi> 1682, appeared by accompt to have been 84000.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Monsieur Morery,</hi> the great French Author of the late <hi>Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Dictionaries,</hi> who makes <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> the greatest City in the <hi>World,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:60342:5"/>
doth reckon but 50000 houses in the same, and other Authors and knowing Men much less; nor are there full 7000 houses in the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> so as if the 50000 houses of <hi>Paris</hi> and the 7000 houses in the City of <hi>Dublin</hi> were added toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the total is but 57000 hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, whereas those of <hi>London</hi> are 87000 as aforesaid, or as 6 to 9.</p>
            <p n="7">7. As for the Shipping and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Commerce of <hi>London,</hi> the common sense of all Men doth judge it to be far greater than that of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Rouen</hi> put together.</p>
            <p n="8">8. As to the Wealth and Gain accruing to the Inhabitants of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> by Law-suits (or <hi>La chicane</hi>) lonely say that the Courts
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60342:6"/>
of <hi>London</hi> extend to all <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and affect seven Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of People, whereas those of <hi>Paris</hi> do not extend near so far: Moreover there is no palpable conspicuous argument at <hi>Paris</hi> for the Number and Wealth of Lawyers like the Buildings and Chambers in the <hi>Two Temples, Lincoln's Inn, Gray's Inn, Doctors Commons,</hi> and the seven other Inns in which are Chimnies, which are to be seen at <hi>London,</hi> besides many Lodgings, Halls and Offices relating to the same.</p>
            <p n="9">9. As to the plentifull and easie living of the People we say,
<list>
                  <item>1. That the People of <hi>Paris</hi> to those of <hi>London,</hi> being as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60342:6"/>
6 to 7, and the Housing of the same as about 6 to 9, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that the People do not live at <hi>London</hi> so close and crouded as at <hi>Paris,</hi> but can afford themselves more room and liberty.</item>
                  <item>2. That at <hi>London</hi> the <hi>Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi> are better and more desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than those of <hi>Paris,</hi> for that in the best at <hi>Paris</hi> there die 2 out of 15, whereas at <hi>London</hi> there die out of the worst scarce 2 of 16, and yet but a fiftieth part of the whole die out of the <hi>Hospitals</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> and ⅖ or 20 times that proportion die out of the <hi>Paris Hospitals</hi> which are of the same kind; that is to say, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those at <hi>London</hi> who chuse to lie sick in <hi>Hospitals</hi> rather than
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60342:7"/>
in their own Houses, are to the like People of <hi>Paris</hi> as one to twenty; which shews the greater Poverty or want of Means in the People of <hi>Paris</hi> than those of <hi>London.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. We infer from the premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <hi>viz.</hi> the dying scarce 2 of 16 out of the <hi>London Hospitals,</hi> and about 2 of 15 in the best of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> (to say nothing of <hi>L' hostel Dieu</hi>) That either the <hi>Physicians</hi> and <hi>Chirurgeons</hi> of <hi>London</hi> are better than those of <hi>Paris,</hi> or that the Air of <hi>London</hi> is more wholesome.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. As for the other great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>World,</hi> if <hi>Paris</hi> were the greatest, we need say no more
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60342:7"/>
in behalf of <hi>London.</hi> As for <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi> in <hi>China,</hi> we have no account fit to reason upon; nor is there any thing in the Description of the two late Voyages of the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes's Emperour</hi> from that City into East and West <hi>Tartary,</hi> in the years 1682 and 1683, which can make us recant what we have said concerning <hi>London.</hi> As for <hi>Dely</hi> and <hi>Agra</hi> belonging to the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gull</hi> we find nothing against our position, but much to shew the vast numbers which attend that <hi>Emperour</hi> in his business and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</p>
            <p n="11">11. We shall conclude with <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Gran Cairo</hi>; as for <hi>Constantinople</hi> it hath been said by one who endeavour'd to shew
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60342:8"/>
the greatness of that City, and the greatness of the <hi>Plague</hi> which reigned in it, that there died 1500 <hi>per diem,</hi> without other circumstances: To which we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that in the year 1665 there died in <hi>London</hi> 1200 <hi>per diem,</hi> and it hath been well proved that the <hi>Plague</hi> of <hi>London</hi> never carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way above ⅕ of the People, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is commonly believed that in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and other <hi>Eastern Cities,</hi> and even in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> that the <hi>Plague</hi> takes away ⅖ one half or more; wherefore where 1200 is but ⅕ of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple it is probable that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was greater, than where 1500 was ⅖ or one half, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:60342:8"/>12. As for <hi>Gran Cairo</hi> it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that 73000 died in 10 weeks or 1000 <hi>per diem,</hi> where note, that at <hi>Gran Cairo</hi> the <hi>Plague</hi> comes and goes away suddenly, and that the <hi>Plague</hi> takes away 2 or ⅗ parts of the People as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid; so as 73000 was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the number of those that died of the <hi>Plague</hi> in one whole year at <hi>Gran Cairo,</hi> whereas at <hi>London Anno</hi> 1665, 97000 were brought to account to have died in that year. Wherefore it is certain, that that City wherein 97000 was but ⅕ of the People, the number was greater than where 73000 was ⅖ or the half.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60342:9"/>We therefore conclude, that <hi>London</hi> hath more <hi>People, Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, Shipping</hi> and <hi>Wealth,</hi> than <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Rouen</hi> put together; and for ought yet appears, is more considerable than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther City in the <hi>Vniverse,</hi> which was propounded to be proved.</p>

            <p>Tending to prove that in the Hospital called <hi>L' hostel Dieu</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> there die above 3000 <hi>per Annum</hi> by reason of ill accommodation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT appears that <hi>Anno</hi> 1678 there entred into the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spital of <hi>La Charité</hi> 2647 Souls, of which there died there within the said year 338, which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60342:10"/>
is above an <hi>eighth part</hi> of the said 2647, and that in the same year there entred into <hi>L' hostel Dieu</hi> 21491, and <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there died out of that number 5630, which is above <hi>one quarter,</hi> so as about half the said 5630, being 2815, seem to have died for want of as good usage and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as might have been had at <hi>La Charité.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Moreover in the year 1679 there entred into <hi>La Charité</hi> 3118, of which there died 452, which is above a <hi>seventh part,</hi> and in the same year there entred into <hi>L' ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stel Dieu</hi> 28635, of which there died 8397, and in both the said years 1678 and 1679 (being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different in their degrees of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60342:10"/>
Mortality) there entred into <hi>L' hostel Dieu</hi> 28635 and 21491, in all 50126, the Medium where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is 25063, and there died out of the same in the said Two years 5630 &amp; 8397, in all 14027, the Medium whereof is 7013.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There entred in the said years into <hi>La Charité</hi> 2647 and 3118, in all 5765, the Medium whereof is 2882, whereof there died 338 and 452, in all 790, the Medium whereof is 395.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Now if there died out of <hi>L' hostel Dieu</hi> 7013 <hi>per annum,</hi> and that the proportion of those that died out of <hi>L' hostel Dieu</hi> is double to those that died out of <hi>La Charité</hi> (as by the above
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60342:11"/>
Numbers it appears to be near there abouts) then it follows that half the said Numbers of 7013 being 3506, did not die by <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural necessity,</hi> but by the evil administration of that Hospital.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This Conclusion seem'd at the first sight very strange, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be some mistake or chance than a solid and real truth, but considering the same matter as it appeared at <hi>London,</hi> we were more reconciled to the belief of it, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In the Hospital of St. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew</hi> in <hi>London</hi> there was sent out and <hi>cured</hi> in the year 1685, 1764 Persons, and there <hi>died</hi> out of the said Hospital 252.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60342:11"/>
Moreover there were sent out and <hi>cured</hi> out of St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spital 1523, and <hi>buried</hi> 209, that is to say, there were cur'd in both Hospitals 3287, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out of both Hospitals 461, and consequently cured and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried 3748, of which number the 461 buried is less than an <hi>eighth part,</hi> whereas at <hi>La Charité</hi> the part that died was more than an <hi>eighth part</hi>; which shews that out of the most poor and wretched Hospitals of <hi>London</hi> there died fewer in proportion than out of the best in <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Farthermore, it hath been above shewn that there died out of <hi>La Charité</hi> at a Medium 395 <hi>per annum,</hi> and 141 out of <hi>Les
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60342:12"/>
Incurables</hi> making in all 536; and that out of St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s and St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Hospital, <hi>London,</hi> there died at a Medium but 461, of which <hi>Les Incurables</hi> are part; which shews that although there be more People in <hi>London</hi> than in <hi>Paris,</hi> yet there went at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> not so many People to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitals as there did at <hi>Paris,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the poorest Hospitals at <hi>London,</hi> were better than the best at <hi>Paris</hi>; which shews that the poorest People at <hi>London</hi> have better accommodation in their own houses, than the best Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of <hi>Paris</hi> affordeth.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Having proved that there die about 3506 Persons at <hi>Paris un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarily</hi> to the damage of <hi>France,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:60342:12"/>
we come next to compute the value of the said damage and of the Remedy thereof, as follows, <hi>viz.</hi> the value of the said 3506 at 60 <hi>li. Sterl. per</hi> head, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the value of <hi>Argier Slaves,</hi> (which is less than the intrinsick value of People at <hi>Paris</hi>) the whole loss of the Subjects of <hi>France</hi> in that Hospital seems to be 60 times 3506 <hi>li. Sterl. per Annum, viz.</hi> 210 thousand 360 <hi>li. Sterl.</hi> equivalent to about two Millions 524 Thous. 320 <hi>French Livers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. It hath appeared that there came into <hi>L' hostel Dieu</hi> at a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium 25063 <hi>per Annum,</hi> or 2089 <hi>per Mensem,</hi> and that the whole stock of what remain'd in the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60342:13"/>
precedent Months is at a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um about 2108 (as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the third Line of the Table N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 5, which shall be short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly published) <hi>viz.</hi> the Medium of Months is 2410 for the sickly year 1679, whereunto 1806, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing added as the Medium of Months for the year 1678 makes 4216, the Medium whereof is the 2108 above mentioned; which number being added to the 2089 which entred each Month, makes 4197 for the Number of Sick which are supposed to be always in <hi>L' hostel Dieu</hi> one time with another.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Now if 60 <hi>French Livers per Annum</hi> for each of the said 4197 sick Persons were added to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60342:13"/>
the present ordinary Expence of that Hospital (amounting to an addition of 251 Thousand 820 <hi>Livers</hi>) it seems that so many lives might be saved as are worth above ten times that sum, and this by doing a manifest deed of Charity to Mankind.</p>
