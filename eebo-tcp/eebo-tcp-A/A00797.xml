            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

together with the defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of them; not doubting but
if thou peruse and ponder them well, they will
turne to thy benefit more wayes then one. First,
supposing thou neuer heardst any thing of these
conferences but in general, or perhaps hast heard
particulers falsly related by some who are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially

this my labour be certified of the truth, and heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

others from ignorance and errour, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
such false rumours as thou mayst chance
to vnderstand to haue bene spread abroad, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in speach, or in print, about this matter.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if thou be not thy selfe already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued

by meanes of it, in euery other article, &amp; point

without doubt he shall perish euerlastingly.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if thou be already rightly resolued,

            <p>Some may perhaps meruaile, Why these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
come out so late, it being now long since
the Aduersaries haue giuen out false Reports,
both in speaches, and print? For answere herof,
it must be considered, that besides the ordinary
difficulties which Catholiques in <hi>England</hi> haue,
eyther to write for want of conuenient place,
tyme, commodity of bookes, and conferring
which others, or to print; there haue bene some
speciall extraordinary impediments which haue
hindred the same. As namely, that <hi>M. Fisher</hi>
was straightly charged, vpon his Allegiance,
from his Maiesty, that then was liuing, not to
set out, or publish what passed in some of these
Conferences, vntill he gaue Licence; which
made both <hi>M. Fisher,</hi> &amp; his friends to forbeare,
hoping (as was promised by him who deliuered
his maiesties message) that <hi>D. Whyte</hi> and others
were not to publish any thing,<note place="margin">L. K.</note> vntill they mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with <hi>M. Fisher,</hi> should treate, and agree, &amp;
vnder their hands confirme what was sayd on
both sides; which his Maiesty perusing, would
grant licence to publish. The which meeting
<hi>M. Fisher</hi> expected a long while, &amp; once went
to <hi>D. Whytes</hi> House, to know what he would say
<pb facs="tcp:27141:4"/>
about the Relation which he had set out; but
found him vnwilling to make any such treaty &amp;
agrement, nor would himself set out in print, or
writing, what he thought to be the true Relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>,
as knowing by likelihood that he could not set
out the truth, without disaduantage of his cause,
or not without impayring, or at least not aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
his owne credit so much, as he desired.</p>
            <p>If any meruayle, why in these Relations so litle
is sayd of the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d Dayes Conference with <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour
Whyte,</hi> the reason is, because in a manner all
the speach of that meeting, was betweene his
Maiesty, and <hi>M. Fisher,</hi> who beareth that dutifull
respect to his Soueraigne, that he will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any thing sayd by him, to be published now
after his death, which he had so specially for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to be published in the tyme of his life. For
if this cause had not bene, it had bene also now
published as wel as the rest; there being nothing
in it, which <hi>M. Fisher</hi> should be ashamed off,
or by which any preiudice might come to the
Catholique Cause: for if there had bene any such
matter, <hi>D. White</hi> (who in generall tearmes doth
in his Preface seeke to disgrace <hi>M. Fisher,</hi> saying,
<hi>he vanished away with disgrace</hi>) would not haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to set downe in particuler some, at least
one, blame-worthy Argument, or Answere. But
of this, as also of <hi>D. Featlyes</hi> indeauouring to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
<hi>M. Fisher,</hi> by obiecting falsly-supposed
<pb facs="tcp:27141:5"/>
Vntruthes, Contradictions &amp;c. more is to be
sayd in another place; and therfore not being
willing to hold thee, Gentle Reader, any longer
from the consideration of the first Occasion of
all this busines, I commit thee to the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Almighty God.</p>

               <p>FIRST, It is certaine,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. Heb. 11.</note> that there is
one, and but <hi>one,</hi> true, diuine, infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible

Faith, without which none can
please God, or attayne Saluation.</p>
               <p>2. This <hi>one,</hi> true, diuine, infallible
Faith, is wholy grounded vpon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Gods word; and in this it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
not only from all humane scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
bred by a cleere sight, or euident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
and from humane opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
proceeding from probable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
or coniectures, &amp; from humane
Faith built vpon the authority of <hi>Pitha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi>
his <hi>Ipse dixit,</hi> or the word of any
other man; but also from all other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
knowledge, had, either by cleere
vision of the diuine Essence, which
Saints haue in heauen, or by cleere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation
of diuine Mysteries, which
some principall persons, to wit, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes,</hi>
and <hi>Prophers,</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> had
on earth; and also from that Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall
discursiue knowledge, which lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men attaine vnto, by the vse of
their naturall wit, in deducing Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:27141:10"/>
partly out of the foundations of
supernaturall Faith, partly out of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of naturall reason: From all these
kindes of knowledge (I say) that one

in that it is grounded wholly vpon
the authority of the <hi>VVord of God,</hi> as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
fallible Faith is grounded vpon
the authority of the <hi>VVord of Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. This <hi>VVord of God,</hi> vpon which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
infallible faith is grounded, is not
only the word of God <hi>Increate,</hi> or the
prime Verity, but also the word <hi>Created,</hi>
or Reuelation proceeding from that
prime Verity, by which the truth of
Christian mysteries, by Christ (who is
true God) was first made manifest to
the Apostles, and other his Disciples;
partly by the exteriour preaching of
his owne mouth, but chiefly by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
reuelation of his eternall heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father, and by the inspiration of the
<hi>holy Ghost.</hi> Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>dly, It was made knowne
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:27141:11"/>
to others liuing in those dayes, partly by
owtward preaching, partly by the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges
of the aforesaid Apostles, and
Disciples, to whome Christ gaue lawfull
mission &amp; commission to teach, saying
<hi>Teach all nations,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 28..</note> promising that himselfe
would be with them all dayes,<note place="margin">Ioan. 16.</note> vnto the
end of the world;<note place="margin">Luc. 10.</note> and that his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
should assist them, and teach them,
(and consequently make them able to
teach others) all Truth, in such sort, as
whosoeuer should heare them, should
heare Christ himself, and so should be
made <hi>docibles Dei,</hi> and as the Prophet
foretould, <hi>docti √† Domino,</hi> and as <hi>S. Paul</hi>
speaketh of some, <hi>Epistola Christi,</hi> the
epistle of Christ, written not with inke,
but with the spirit of God. Whence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
that not only the Word <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create,</hi>
but also the Word <hi>Created,</hi> may
be truly sayd to be the Foundation of
our Faith; and not only that Word
which was immediatly inspired by the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:27141:11"/>
heauenly Father, or by the holy Ghost,
in the hartes of the Apostles, and other
Disciples, who liued in our Sauiours
dayes; but also the Word, as well prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
as written by the Apostles, and
also that Word, which by the preaching
and writing of the Apostles, was by the
holy Ghost imprinted in the hartes of
the immediate hearers, who were ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
said to be the Epistles of Christ,
as I haue already noted.</p>
               <p>4. This <hi>Word of God</hi> (which I call
<hi>Created,</hi> to distinguish it from the word
<hi>Increate</hi>) being partly preached, partly
written, partly inspired or imprinted in
manner aforesaid) was not to cease at
the death of the Apostles and Disciples
and their immediate hearers,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.</note> but by the
appointment of God (who would haue
all men to be saued, and come to the
knowledge of the Truth,) was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued
to posterity; not by new imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
reuelations, or <hi>Enthusiasmes,</hi> nor by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:27141:12"/>
sending <hi>Angells</hi> to all particuler men,
but by a continuated succession of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Doctours,</hi> and <hi>Pastors,</hi> and lawfully-sent
<hi>Preachers</hi> in all ages, who partly by
Transcripts of what was written first by
the Apostles; but cheifly by <hi>Vocall</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the same doctrine, without
change, which the Pastors of euery age
successiuely one from another receaued
of their predecessors, as they who liued
in the age next to the Apostles dayes,
receaued it from the Apostles, as a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<hi>Depositum,</hi> to be kept and preserued
in the Church, maugre all the assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of Helly gates, which according to
Christs promise, shall neuer preua-le

yeares, but in al ages since Christ, there
was, is, and shalbe the true <hi>Word of God</hi>
preached by <hi>visible Doctours, Pastors,</hi> and
lawfully sent <hi>Preachers,</hi> so guided by
Christ and his holy spirit, that by them
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:27141:12"/>
people of euery Age were, are, and
shalbe sufficiently instructed in true,
diuine, infallible Faith, in all thinges
necessary to Saluation; to the intent,
that they may not be little ones, waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.</note>
nor carried about <hi>with euery winde
of new doctrine;</hi> which being contrary to
the ould and first receaued, must needs
be false.</p>
               <p>5. Wheras by this which is already
said (which if need be, may be morefully
proued) it apeareth first, that there is
one, true, diuine, infallible Faith, neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to saluation. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>dly, that this Faith
is wholy grounded vpon the word of
God. Thirdly, that this word of God, is
not only the word <hi>Increate,</hi> but also the
word <hi>Created,</hi> either inwardly inspired, or
outwardly preached, or written, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
without change in one, or other
continued succession of <hi>Visible Pastors,
Doctours,</hi> and lawfully-sent <hi>Preachers,</hi>
rightly teaching, by the direction of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:27141:13"/>
Christ, and his holy spirit, the said word
of God wheras (I say) all this doth most
euidently appeare by this which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
sayd.</p>
               <p>That I may proue the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> Church
only, and those who consent and agree
in doctrine of Faith with it, to haue
that <hi>one,</hi> true, diuine, infallible Faith,
which is necessarie to saluation,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus I dispute.</hi>
                  <lb/>
If it be needfull, that there should
be one, or other continuall succession
of <hi>Visible Pastors,</hi> in which, and by which
the vnchanged word of God, vpon
which true, diuine, infallible Faith is
grounded, is preserued and preached;
and no other succession besides that of
the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and others, which
agree in Faith with it, can be shewed (as
if any such were, may be shewed) out
of approued Histories, or other ancient
monuments; Then without doubt, the
<hi>Roman Church</hi> only, and such as agree
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:27141:13"/>
with it in Faith, haue that true, diuine,
infallible Faith, which is necessary to
saluation.</p>
               <p>But there must be one, or other such
succession of <hi>Visible Pastors;</hi> and no other
can be shewed out of approued Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
or ancient monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ts, besides that

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Roman Church</hi> only, and such
others as agree with it in Faith, hath
true, diuine, infallible Faith, necessarie
to saluation.</p>
               <p>The Consequence of the <hi>Maior</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
with reason be denied, and if it be,
it shalbe proued.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> hath two partes. The

already said, and if need be it shalbe

            <head>A briefe Relation of what passed betweene D.

and to prepare himselfe to
oppugne it in a Confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce with <hi>M.
Fisher:</hi> who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> he wrot it, &amp; gaue
it to the Lady, did not thinke, or sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that any such great matter should haue bene made
of it, as after proued, M. <hi>D. Whyte</hi> hauing (as he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>fessed
after to M. <hi>Fisher</hi>) had this paper about ten dayes in his
handes, studying what to say to it, came as he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
to the place of meeting, and M. <hi>Fisher</hi> being
then a Prisoner, was also sent for. At the houre and
place prefixed, both the one, and the other (as they
were bidden) sate downe before a few, but very Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
Persons, whose names I will onely (as M.
<hi>Fisher</hi> first did) expresse in these ensuing letters. L.
K.  L. M. B.  L. B. &amp; M. B. Then <hi>D. Whyte</hi> drew
out a copie of the aforesaid written paper, and asked
M. <hi>Fisher</hi> whether he wrote it. Vnto which M. <hi>Fisher</hi>
answered, I wrote such a thing, &amp; if it be a true co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
I will defend it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:27141:16"/>
Then <hi>D. Whyte</hi> read the first point of the said pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
in which was said: <hi>This is one, and has one, was, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
Faith</hi> &amp;c. This saith <hi>D. Whyte,</hi> is true, if Faith be
vnderstood explicite, or implicite. Which to be the true
sense <hi>M. Fisher</hi> assented.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>D. White</hi> read the second point, in which
was said, <hi>That this true, diuine Faith, was wholy prouided vpon
the word of God &amp;c.</hi> This also <hi>D. White</hi> yielded to be
true.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>D. White</hi> read the third point, in which was
said, <hi>That this word of God, vpon which Faith was grounded, is
not only the Word increate, but also the Word Created, to wit,
the diuine reuelation made manifest, partly by Christes <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>

preaching, partly by the holy Ghosts inward inspiration in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
hartes of the Apostles &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This point also <hi>D. White</hi> allowed, but knowing
what followed in the fourth point, he asked <hi>M. Fisher,</hi>
whether he thought that the holy Ghost was equally
in others, as in the Apostles? <hi>M. Fisher</hi> said, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
of the holy Ghost was promised, &amp; giuen both
to the Apostles, &amp; others, yet not in the same degree,
nor in the samefull measure; but the Apostles, as being
after Christ the prime foundations of the Church, had
the holy Ghost in such high degree, and full measure,
that they could, and did write Canonicall Scriptures.
Others that were Pastours and Doctours, had it in an
inferiour degree, yet so, as by it they were enabled to
teach infallibly, and without change, the substance of
all pointes needfull to saluation, especially when in a
generall Councell, after discussion of the matter, they
did conclude as the Apostles and Seniours did, <hi>Visum
est spiritui sancto &amp; nis.</hi> It seemeth good to the holy
Ghost, and vs. The people also had a measure of the
same spirit, sufficient to enable the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to conceiue rightly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:27141:16"/>
and to belieue stedfastly the teaching of their Pastours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>D. Whyte</hi> did not disallow the substance of this
answere, but only made a verball Obiection, saying:
<hi>The Apostles had inspiration, Pastours and People onely illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Fisher</hi> answered, that both Apostles &amp; Pastours
had inspiration and illumination, in regard the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the holy Ghost, as receiued in the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
is called <hi>Illumination,</hi> and as receiued in the will,
it is called <hi>Inspiration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>L. K. bad them leaue that verball controuersy, and
proceed in the matter. <hi>D. Whyte</hi> excepted against
that part of the paper, wherin was said, That the word
of God was partly written, partly vnwritten, and
would haue nothing to be the word of God, but what
is written in Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Fisher</hi> to iustifie that part of the paper, first al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
that Text of <hi>S. Paul, Hold the traditions which you
haue learned, whether by our Word, or Epistle.</hi> 2. He made
these two ensuing arguments (to proue that more
is to be belieued by diuine Faith then is written in
Scripture.)</p>
            <p>It is necessarie to belieue, by diuine Faith, that <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis,</hi>
Exodus, and other particuler Books are Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
and diuine Scripture.</p>
            <p>But this to be so, is not assuredly knowen by the
only Word written. <hi>Ergo</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Moreouer <hi>Protestants</hi> hould, and belieue this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position:
Nothing is to be belieued by Christian Faith,
but what is contayned in Scripture:</p>
            <p>But this Proposition, is not contayned in the word
written. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Somthing is belieued euen by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
which is not contayned in the written Word,
and therefore they must admit for a ground of Faith
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:27141:17"/>
some Word of God not written.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>D. Whyte answered:</hi> Although at that time when S.
<hi>Paul</hi> wrote the text alledged, some part of Gods word
was not written, yet afterwards all needfull to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued,
was written. This <hi>D. Whyte</hi> said, but did not,
not cannot proue, especially out of any parte of the
written Word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>D. Woyte</hi> alledged this text, <hi>Omnis scriptura diuinit<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>
inspirata, vtilis est&amp;c.</hi> But (as <hi>M. Fisher</hi> then tould him)
this Text doth not proue the point which is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
For this text doth not say, that all which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinely
inspired, was written, or that <hi>Genesis, Exodus,</hi>
and other particuler books, are diuinely inspired, or
that nothing is to be belieued which is not contayned
in scripture; but only saith, <hi>That all, or euery Scripture di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinely
inspired, is profitable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>D. Whyte</hi> said: Scripture is not onely said simply to
be profitable, but to be profitable, to argue, to teach, to
correct, to instruct, that the man of God may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
and therfore being profitable to all these offices, it
may be said to be sufficient.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Fisher</hi> replyed: Although wood be profitable to
make the substance of the house, to make wainscot, to
make tables and stooles, and other furniture, yet hence
doth not follow, that wood alone is sufficient to
build and furnish a house. I will notsay, that heere
<hi>D. White</hi> was at a <hi>Nonplus,</hi> because I vnderstand that
word <hi>Nonplus,</hi> doth not please him; but the truth is
that to this <hi>D. Whyte</hi> did make no answere. And for my
part I professe, I do not see what answere he could
haue made to the purpose, and worthy of that Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and vnderstanding Audience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>D. Whyte</hi> therefore without saying any thing to
this instance, seemed to be weary, and giving the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:27141:17"/>
to <hi>M. Fisher,</hi> had him read on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Fisher</hi> taking the paper, read the fourth Point, in
which was sayd, <hi>That at the word of God manifested to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
and by them to their immediate hearers, was not to cease
at their death, but was to be continued and propagated without
change, in, and by one, or other companie of visible Pastours, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours,
and lawfully-sent preachers successiuely in all ages &amp;c.</hi>
All which to be true being at last graunted, or not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
by <hi>D. Whyte, M. Fisher</hi> proposed the first of the
two arguments set downe in the aforesaid Paper. viz.</p>
            <p>If there must be in all ages one, or other continuall
succession of visible Pastours, Doctours, and lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-sent
Preachers by whom the vnchanged word of
God, vpon which Faith is grounded, was preserued &amp;c
preached in all ages since Christ; and no other is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
or can be shewed, besides those of the Roman
Church, and such as agree in Faith with them; Then
none, but the Pastours of the Romane Church, and
such as agree in Faith with them, haue that one, infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
diuine, vnchanged Faith which is necessarie to
saluation.</p>
            <p>But there must be such a visible succession, &amp; none
such can be shewed different in Faith from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
of the Roman Church. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Onely the Pastours of the Romane Church;
and such as agree in Faith with them, preserue and
teach that one, infallible, diuine, vnchaunged Faith
which is necessarie to saluation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>D. Whyte</hi> answered, That it was sufficient to shew
a succession of visible Pastours, teaching vnchanged
doctrine in all points fundamentall, although not in
points not fundamentall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Fisher</hi> replyed saying: First, that if time permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
he could proue all pointes of diuine Faith, to be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:27141:18"/>
fundamentall (supposing they were points generally
held, or defined by full authority of the Church; (to
which purpose he did recite the beginning of this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of S. Augustine: <hi>Ferendus est disputator errans in
alijs quaestionibus non diligenter digestis, nondum plena autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate
Ecclesia firmatis, ibi ferendus est error; non tant√πm pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredi
debet, vt ipsum fundamentum quatere moliatur.</hi> In
which <hi>S. Auston</hi> insinuateth, that to erre in any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
defined by full authority of the Church, is to
shake the foundation of Faith, or to erre in points fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall.
But <hi>M. Fisher</hi> not hauing the booke at hand
(and fearing to be tedious in arguing vpon a text
which he had not ready to shew) passed on: and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
required <hi>D. Whyte</hi> to giue him a Catalogue of
all points fundamentall, or a definition or description
(well proued out of Scripture, and in which all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
will agree) by which one may discerne which
be, and which be not points fundamentall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>D. Whyte</hi> reiected this demaund, as thinking it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
to require of him a Catalogue, or defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or description of Points fundamentall, out of
Scripture, in which all Protestants will agree. But
(considering in what sense <hi>D. Whyte</hi> did understand
this distinction of points fundamentall, and not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
(to wit, that none could be saued who did
not belieue all pointes fundamentall rightly; and that
none should be damned for not belieuing other
pointes, vnles he did wilfully against his conscience
deny, or not belieue them;) <hi>M. Fishers</hi> demand was
both reasonable and most necessary; for sith all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
agree in houlding it necessarie to be certaine
of their saluation; and that none can be saued, who
do not belieue all points fundamentall; and that
in these pointes, one must not content himselfe with
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:27141:18"/>
implicite Faith, but must expressely know them; it is
most necessary, that all Protestants should out of
Scripture) which they pretend to be their onely Rule
of Faith) find, and conclude with vnanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
certainly, what is, and what is not a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
point of Faith, necessary to saluation. For whiles
some hould more, some lesse to be fundamentall, and
none of them giueth (out of Scripture) a sufficient rule
by which it may be discerned, which is, and which is
not fundamentall; how can ech particuler Protestant
rest assured, that he belieueth expresly all points funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,
or so much as is necessary, and sufficient to
make him assured of saluation. But to returne to the
Relation. <hi>D. Whyte,</hi> hauing reiected <hi>M. Fishers</hi> demand,
requiring a Catalogue, definition or description out of
Scripture (in which all Protestants will agree) said:
That all those points were fundamentall, which were
contained in the Creed of the Apostles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Fisher</hi> might haue asked him diuers questions
vpon this answere. 1. What text of scripture taught
him, that all the points contained in the Apostles
Creed were fundamentall in the sense aforesaid? Or,
That this Creed was composed by the Apostles, as a
summary of Faith, contayning points needfull (at least
<hi>necessitate Praecepti</hi>) to be expresly belieued by all men?
The Church indeed so teacheth, but the Scripture hath
not any text which doth expressly say so, or whence
by necessarie consequence so much may be gathered;
and therefore according to Protestant principles (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
nothing to be belieued but <hi>Onely</hi> Scripture)
the Apostles Creed ought not to be beleiued, as a rule
of any point of Faith, and much lesse a rule contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
all principall and fundamentall points of Faith.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>M. Fisher</hi> might haue asked, Whether <hi>Onely</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:27141:19"/>
the words of the Creed are needfull to be held, as a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
foundation of Fayth, or the Catholique senses.
If onely the wordes; then the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
Heretikes may be sayd to haue held all the
fundamentall points sufficient to Saluation; which is
contrary to the iudgement of Antiquity, and is most
absurd. If the Catholique sense; then the question
must be, who must be iudge to determine which is the
catholique sense? and whether it be not most reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
and necessary, that the Catholique Church it
selfe, rather then any particuler man, or Sect of men,
should teach the true sense? When especially,<note place="margin">Ioan. 14. &amp; 16.</note> the holy
Ghost was promised to the catholique church (and
not to any particuler man, or Sect of men, differing in
doctrine from it) to teach it all Truth.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>M. Fisher</hi> might haue asked, whether all points
fundamentall were expressed in the creed, or not? If
they be not, by what other rule shall one know, what
is a point fundamentall? If all which is fundamentall
be expressed in the creed, then to belieue only Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or to belieue that there is any Scripture at
all, is not fundamentall, or necessary to Saluation;
but to belieue the catholique church (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the truth of all such doctrines of Fayth,
which she generally teacheth, or defineth in her ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
councells) is fundamentall. So as, we may say
with <hi>S. Athanasius,</hi> Whosoeuer will be saued, must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
the catholique Fayth (that is, the Fayth taught
by the catholique church) and this not only in part
or in a corrupt sense, but in all points, and in catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
sense. For as the same <hi>S. Athanasius</hi> saith, vnles one
belieue the said Catholique faith (integram inuiolatam<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>)
entiere and inuiolate, without doubt he shall perish
euerlastingly. All these questions <hi>M. Fisher</hi> might
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:27141:19"/>
haue asked, but he at that present only asked, Whether
all articles of the Creed, were held by <hi>D. Whyte</hi> to be
fundamentall?</p>
            <p>To which Question <hi>D. Whyte</hi> answered, That
all was fundamentall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Fisher</hi> asked, Whether the article of christs
descending into hell, were fundamentall?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>D. Whyte</hi> said, Yes.</p>
            <p>Why then (said <hi>M. Fisher</hi>) did <hi>M. Rogers</hi> affirme,
<hi>That the Church of England is not yet resolued,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rogers in his doctrine of the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, Art. 3.</note> 
               <hi>what is
the right sense of that Article?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was answered, that <hi>M. Rogers</hi> was a priuate
man. <hi>M. Fisher</hi> replyed: That his Booke in the title
professeth to be set out by publique authority. To
which <hi>M. Fisher</hi> might haue added. That the Booke
so set out by publique authority, beareth title of the
Catholique, or Vniuersall doctrine of the church of
England; by which addition is shewed a difference
betwixt this book of <hi>M. Rogers,</hi> and some others,
which were obiected to be set out by licence of the
catholique side: for these our books are only licenced
to come out in the name of such, or such a priuate
author, and as books declaring his priuate opinions:
but this of <hi>M. Rogers</hi> was authorized, and graced
with the title of the Catholique doctrine of the church
of England, and therfore ought by Protestants to be
more respected, then other priuate mens books.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Fisher</hi> not thinking it necessary to presse this
difference, returned againe to <hi>D. Whytes</hi> first answere
to the maine argument, in which he hauing said,
That it was sufficient to shew a visible succession of
such as held points fundamentall, did implicitely
graunt it necessary, that a succession should be shewed
of such visible Pastours as did hold all points, which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:27141:20"/>
at least himself held to be fundamentall, or necessary
to saluation. Whereupon <hi>M. Fisher</hi> bad <hi>D. Whyte</hi>
name a continuall companie, or succession of visible
Protestants (different from the Romane Church
which they call Papists) holding all points which
he accounted fundamentall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>D. Whyte</hi> expresly graunted, That he could not
shew such a visible succession of Pastours and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours
(differing in doctrine from the Romane
church) who held all points which he accounted
fundamentall. Which his ingenuous confession, I
desire the Reader to note, applying it to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which <hi>M. Fisher</hi> proposed, shewing that Onely
the Roman church hath had such a succession. For
if, as the argument vrgeth, one such succession hath
bene, and none differing in doctrine from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
can be shewed by <hi>D. Whyte</hi> (being accounted
a prime Protestant Controuersist, who may teach such
as <hi>D. Featly,</hi> as was lately professed by <hi>D. Featly</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self)
we may absolutely conclude, that no such visible
succession was of Protestants, so farre as they differ in
doctrine from the Roman church, and consequently
till they assigne some other (which they can neuer do)
they must acknowledge the Romane to be the only
church, or at least a church which hath had a visible
succession, teaching the vnchanged Faith of christ
in all ages, in all points, at least fundamentall: which
being acknowledged, worthily might <hi>M. Fisher</hi> aske
(as he did aske) <hi>D. Whyte,</hi> Why <hi>Protestants</hi> made a
schisme from the Romane church? and why <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
did persecute Romane catholiques, contrary
to the custome of the ancient Fathers, who still kept
vnity with other churches, although in their opinion
holding errours; (vntill the catholique church by
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:27141:20"/>
full authority defined them to be errours in Faith)
and that after such definition of the church (which
was yet neuer made against the Romane church)
they would still obstinatly persist in errour; as
appeareth in <hi>S. Cyprians</hi> case. To these demaunds
made by <hi>M. Fisher, D. Whyte</hi> answered; We do not
persecute you for Religion. About which answere
I desire the gentle Reader to obserue, that <hi>M. Fisher</hi>
asked two Questions. 1. Why <hi>Protestants</hi> made a
schisme from the Romane church? 2. Why <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>
did persecute Romane catholiques?</p>
            <p>To the first of these questions being about Schisme,
<hi>D. Whyte</hi> answered not a word, and yet this was
the most important Question, sufficient to shew Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
to be in a damnable state, vnles they repent
and returne to vnity with the Roman church. For on
the one side, it cannot be denyed, but that schisme
or separation of ones selfe from church-Vnity, is a
most damnable sinne, which cannot be made lawfull
for any cause, nor cannot without repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce, &amp; retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to Vnity, be washed away, euen with martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
it selfe, as the ancient Fathers confesse: And on
the other side it is euident (&amp; euen confessed by some
Protestants) that <hi>Protestants</hi> did separate themselues
from the Romane Church, which is confessed to be
the mother Church, and which cannot be shewed
to haue separated it selfe from a former church yet
extant, as the true church of christ must alwayes be
visibly extant; Neither can there be shewed any other
reason, why Protestants did make, and continue this
their separation, then were, or might haue bene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by Heretiques, and Scismatiques of ancient
times, separating themselues from the catholique Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
church: For setting asyde all temporall res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:27141:21"/>
which doubtles were (but were very insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and vnworthy) causes why some did first, and
do yet continue this separation; there cannot be
imagined any pretended cause which may not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to these two heads: to wit, corruption of
<hi>Manners,</hi> or corruption of <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Corruption of
<hi>manners,</hi> is not a just cause to make one leaue the
Faith, Sacraments, and rites of the church, our
Sauiour hauing sufficiently forewarned what is to
be done in this case,<note place="margin">Matth. 21.</note> when he said; <hi>Vpon the chaire
of Moyses the Scribes and Pharisees have sitten; all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that they say vnto you, obserue, and do, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their works do not.</hi> For by this is shewed
that the separation which in other places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is commanded, is not meant so, as if it were
to be made by neglecting or contradicting the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of lawfully authorized Pastours, or by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally
absenting ones selfe from communicating
with them in necessary Sacraments, and church
Rites, but only spiritually to departe from the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of their ill manners. The second, to wit, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> pertayning to the common
Faith of the catholique Church, neither did, nor can
happen to the whole visible church; christ hauing
promised, that the holy Ghost shalbe alwaies with
it, to teach it all Truth; and that Hell-gates shall
neuer so preuaile against it, as to ouerthrow in it
the fundation of all goodnes, to wit, true Faith. And
for other errours in such questions as are not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by full authority of the said catholique church,
S. <hi>Austens</hi> rule is to be obserued,<note place="margin">Aug. de verb. apost. Ser. 14.</note> whom when he
saith, <hi>Ferendus est disputator errans:</hi> neither must one
for the errour of a few, leaue the society and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of all; neither must one or a few, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:27141:21"/>
vpon their owne priuate reading, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
of scripture, or their priuate spirit (which is
or may be the como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> pretext of all Heretiques) censure
&amp; condemne the doctrine, or practise of the vniuersall
Catholique Church to be erroneous: which to doe, is
by <hi>S. Bernards</hi> sentence, <hi>Intollerable Pride,</hi> and in <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stans</hi>
iudgment, <hi>Insolent madnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The beginning therefore and continuance of the
Schisme, and separation of the Protestants from the
Catholique Romane Church (in which euen, as
<hi>Caluin</hi> confesseth,<note place="margin">Caluin l. Ep. epist. 141.</note> there was made a discession &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from the whole world) is very damnable,
and altogether inexcusable. Which perhaps was the
cause why <hi>D. Whyte</hi> passed ouer that part of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
(touching this Schysme) with silence, and onely
answered, as is aboue said, to the other parte saying:
<hi>We do not persecute you for Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which answere <hi>M. Fisher</hi> replyed, saying: You
do vs wrong, for my self being a prisoner was never
taxed with any state matter, but do suffer for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
L. M. B. made another answere, saying:
You of your side, did first persecute <hi>Protestants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Fisher</hi> answered, that we Catholiques hold all
points, in which Protestants differ from vs in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of faith to be fundamentall, and necessary to
be belieued, or at least not denyed, and so may haue
cause to punish them who deny, or contradict. But
Protestants, who believe catholiques to hold right
in all points which themselues esteeme fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
have no reason to persecute vs, for supposed er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
in points not fundamentall, which Protestants
do not account damnable. For better cleering wherof
<hi>M. Fisher,</hi> asked <hi>D. White,</hi> whether he thought errour
in a point not fundamentall to be damnable?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:27141:22"/>
               <hi>D. White,</hi> said, No, vnles one hold it against his
conscience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Fisher</hi> asked, How one could hould an errour
against his conscience? meaning that one could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
in his conscience believe that be true, which he
knew in his conscience to be an errour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>D. White</hi> answered, That by peruersity of will he
might hould an errour against the knowne truth.
Which answere is true, if he meane, that one who
knoweth the truth at this instant, may after by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity
of Will, incline the Vnderstanding to hold
the contrary errour. But that, at the same instant, he
should know the truth actually, and yet actually
hold, in the same instant, the contrary errour in his
conscience, or inward knowledg, is more then I think
any Philosopher can explicat. For this were to know,
and not know, and to belieue two contraries, Truth,
and Errour, about the same obiect in the same subiect,
the inward conscience at one, and the same instant,
which is impossible.</p>
            <p>M. B. meruayling at <hi>D. Whites</hi> answere asked,
him againe the same question, saying: May one be
saued that holdeth errour in points of Faith, not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall,
supposing he hould not against his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>D. White</hi> sayd; Yes.</p>
            <p>Those (faith M. B.) who suffering for conscience
hould errour in Faith against their conscience, are
worthy to be damned.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Fisher</hi> hauing obserued, that <hi>D. White</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuated,
that one might be damned for holding er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in points of Faith not fundamenall, in case he
hould them against his conscience, said; If it be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to hold errours in points not fundamentall, in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:27141:22"/>
case one hold them willfully against his conscience:
<hi>√† fortiori,</hi> it is damnable to hold the like errours wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and obstinatly, against the known iudgment,
and conscience of the Church. For as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> saith:
<hi>Qua major superbia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bern. serm. 5. de resurrect.</note> 
               <hi>qu√†m vt vnus homo iudicium suum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferattoti
Congregationi?</hi> What greater pride, then that
one man should preferre his iudgment (or conscience)
before the iudgment (and conscience) of the whole
Church?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>D. Whyte</hi> said, he remembred that sentence of <hi>S.
Bernard:</hi> but it is not remembred that he gaue any good
answere, either to that sentence, or to the argument
confirmed by it. Neither indeed can he giue any good
answere, in regard it is certaine, that the iudgment &amp;
conscience of the whole Church (or Congregation
of so many faithfull, wise, learned, and vertuous men,
assisted by the promised Spirit of truth) is incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
more to be respected, and preferred before the
iudgment, and conscience of any priuate man; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by that of Christ our Sauiour, who (without
excepting any who pretendeth to follow his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and without distinguishing the matter in
which he pretendeth to follow it, into points funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,
&amp; not fundamentall) absolutely affirmeth,<note place="margin">Matt. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>He that will not heare</hi> (<hi>that is,</hi> belieue <hi>and</hi> obey) the Church,
let him be to thee as an Heathen &amp; Publican.</p>
            <p>Hence <hi>Protestants</hi> (who preferre their priuate Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gment
and Conscience before the iudgment and
conscience of the Catholique Church, in interpreting
Scriptures, or otherwise) may learne, in what state
they remaine, so long as they do thus, being by the
Censure of <hi>S. Bernard,</hi> extremely <hi>Proud,</hi> and in the
indgement of <hi>S. Austen</hi> insolently <hi>madde,</hi> and by the
sentence of Christ himselfe, to be accounted no better
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:27141:23"/>
then <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Publicans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It seemeth that <hi>D. Whyte</hi> did not deeply ponder
this point, or els was willing to passe ouer it (as a
Cat ouer hote coales) and so he betooke himselfe to
oppugne another part of <hi>M. Fishers</hi> paper, in which is
sayd, that; <hi>No company of visible Pastours deliuering vnchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
doctrine, could be shewed in all ages, besydes those of the
Romane Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>D. Whyte</hi> denyed this to be true, and (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
he had before said that he could not shew
any companie differing in doctrine from the Roman
Church, holding in all ages all fundamentall points)
said, that both the Greeke Church, and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Church had such a succession of visible Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours:
which two sayings, how D. <hi>Whyte</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile,
pertayneth to him to declare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Fisher</hi> replyed, and tould him that the Greeke
Church changed, and erred in a point of Faith, to
wit, about the <hi>holy Ghost.</hi> A like, or greater change he
might, and in likelyhood would, haue tould him to
hauc bene in many points held by the Protestant
Church, if he had not bin interrupted by L. K. who
asked, <hi>Whether notwithstanding that errour of the Greeke
Church, Ignorant man might not be saued?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Fisher</hi> answered to L. K. his question, saying:
Some ignorant men may be excused from actuall
sinne, in holding that errour, as, through inuincible
ignorance, one holding some errour against the holy
Trinity it self, may be excused. Yet for other actuall
sinnes, they might be damned for want of meanes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for remission of them. This answere was
meant by <hi>M. Fisher</hi> of such ignorant men, who (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
by inuincible ignorance excused from the
actuall sinne of positiue Infidelity, Heresy &amp; Scisme)
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:27141:23"/>
wanted true supernaturall Faith, Hope and Charity,
out of which an act of true Contrition springeth; or
wanted the true, and lawfull vse of the Sacrament of
Pennance, &amp; Priestly Absolution; which being need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to obtaine pardon of sinne, may easily be wanting
to such people as commit other sinnes against the light
of nature, or against those good motions of Grace,
which now and then Almighty God giueth to all
sorts, who consequently (through this their owne
fault) are not illuminated with true supernaturall
Faith, but are permitted still to remaine in Infidelity,
or Heresy, or Schisme, or in a negatiue disposition of
want of all Faith, deuotion, and desire of vnion with
God, and such good men who truly serve god in his
true Church: of which sort of ignorant people, it is to
be doubted there be but to many in all (especially In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel,
Hereticall, or Schismaticall) Countries. But
hence doth not follow, neither did <hi>M. Fisher</hi> euer
meane to affitme, that all ignorant Graecians, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
or of any other sort of Schismatiques, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,
or Infidels are damned; for if on the one side
this their ignorance be inuincible, so as to excuse them
from the actuall sinne of their Schisme, Heresy, and
Infidelity; and on the other syde, they by Almighty
Gods speciall grace, be preserued from other actuall
mortall sinne, and by the same grace be excited ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
to Faith, Hope, Charity, and to true
Contrition for all finne, they may be saued: But
this being extraordinary, no man ought ordinarily
presume, or rely on it, especially so, as to neglect the
ordinary meanes, knowne to be in the vnity of the
Catholique Roman Church.</p>
            <p>After this D. <hi>White</hi> excepted against another point
of <hi>M. Fishers</hi> paper, in which was sayd: <hi>That the Roman
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:27141:24"/>
Church had still held vnhanged doctrime of Fayth in all points
&amp;c.</hi> And for instances of change made, he obiected
<hi>Transubstantiation, Images, Communion vnder one kind, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of pennance &amp;c.</hi> These points he slieghtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to touch, but did not (as the paper required) name
when, and by whome the change was made in these
points, but sayd; It was not needful to shew these cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.
As for example (sayth he) the Pharisies
held errour, in saying, that the gold of the Altar was
more holy then the Altar, which was a change in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
&amp; yet you cannot shew when, and by whome
this change was made.</p>
            <p>To this <hi>M. Fisher</hi> answered, that although he could
not on the suddaine tell when, and by whome this
Change was made; yet he did not doubt but that with
study he might find it out. And so indeed, he might
haue named the Author of the Sect of Pharisies, who
first brought in that error, and the time when that Sect
began, which is inough. For we do not presse <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
to tell the very day, or houre in which euery
one of our supposed Errors were brought in; but to
name the first Author of any erroneous doctrine, or
of any Sect of men who were specially noted for
teaching such a peculiar doctrine, and about what
yeare, or Age that Sect of men, first began; and
who they were, who then noted them to teach such
doctrine, contrary so the formerly receaued Fayth of
the vniuersall Church; as must be, and is vsually no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
when especially any such notorious matters as
those which D. <hi>White</hi> obiected, were by any man,
or any sect of men, taught contrary to the formerly
receaued Faith of the vniuersall church.</p>
            <p>Sith therfore, the aforesaid circumstances are
vlually noted in other such kind of changes, and that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:27141:24"/>
it is morally impossible, that such great changes and
so vniuersally spread ouer the world, should be made
ether in an instant, or in succession of time, and that
not one, or other writer would haue made mention
of the change, and when, where, and by whome it
was made, as they do of all other such matters; <hi>D.
White</hi> (who obiected such great changes of doctrine
to haue beene made in the Roman church, accusing
hereby greuiously her, which consessedly was once
the true Mother church,) is obliged and bound, not
only to proue this his accusation, by shewing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd
circumstances, in good Authors, if he will not be
accounted an vnnaturall and false calumniator of
his true Mother-church: but he must also shew ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
continually visible church, which neuer did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any
any such change in doctrine of Faith, if he will
not impiously deny the truth of the Prophesyes and
Promises of Scripture, wherby we learne, that Hell
gates shall not preuaile against the church: And that
christ himself, and his holy spirit will alwaies be with
the church teaching it, and consequently enabling it
to teach vs all truth, and making it the pillar and
ground of truth, and consequently free from all error
in matters of Fayth.</p>
            <p>But D. <hi>White</hi> can neuer proue his accusation by
shewing out of good Authors the aforesayd circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of the change of the Roman church, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Fayth, nor can shew any other continually
visible church, which did not admit change in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Fayth. Let him therfore consider, whether
it be not better to recall his false vnnaturall accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Mother the Roman church, being sorry
for it, with purpose here after humbly to heare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue,
obey, and follo wher doctrine and direction,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:27141:25"/>
rather then to incurre, not only the foresayd censure
of men, but also of christ himselfe, who sayth; <hi>He that
will not heare the Church, let him be to thee as an heathen &amp;
Publican:</hi> that is, cast out of the fauour of God, and all
good men, both in this present life, and also, if he do
not in time repent, in the future eternall life.</p>
            <p>These be the chiefe points which I haue gathered
out <hi>M. Fishers</hi> first Relation, which he shewed to D.
<hi>Whyte</hi> with an inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t that he should put him in mind
if any thing were not remembred, or misremembred:
But the Doctour at that time did not, nor could truly
say, that any thing was safely related; only he sayd, 1.
That himselfe did not remember a point or two, which
both M. <hi>Fisher</hi> and M. B. did perfectly remember to
haue bene so as is here related. 2. He sayd, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more was sayd then is related, which <hi>M. Fisher</hi>
did not deny, but was willing to add any thing, that
D. <hi>Whyte</hi> could put him in mind of, or that himselfe
should after remember: and so being put in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
made by D. <hi>Whyte,</hi> to wit, Whereas <hi>M. Fisher</hi>
vpon some occasion or other, had sayd, <hi>That although
a generall Councell</hi> might erre in the premisses, yet not in
the Conclusion, D. <hi>Whyte</hi> obiected, saying: That in all
scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ces the conclusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> is no more certayne, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses,
&amp; therfore if the premisses in a general councell
be fallible, the conclusion cannot be infallible. To
which <hi>M. Fisher</hi> answered, saying; Although in
sciences which depend only vpon the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the conclusion cannot be more certaine then the
premisses; yet in a generall councell, assisted by the
holy Ghost, in the finall conclusion, or definitiue
sentence, the conclusion is alwayes infallible, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
sometimes the premisses be fallible.</p>
            <p>And M. <hi>Fisher</hi> had great reason to answere in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:27141:25"/>
this manner. Indeed if to define a matter of Fayth
were to conclude the same by way of discourse out of
Principles, as the Argument doth suppose; then if
Councels might erre in the Promisses they might like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
erre in their Conclusion, and d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>finitiue sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
But this supposition is false, Infallibility in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining,
being a diuine Assistance, not to inferre one
thing out of another by way of connexion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
but to decree and declare what is conform<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>„Äà‚Ä¶„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>
to the word of God, by way of authority, binding
the Church so to believe. And this definition is euer
infallible, though all the arguments the Councell
bringes by way of discourse in proofe of the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
eyther before or after the same is made, be not still
demonstratiue.</p>
            <p>Another obiection <hi>M. Fisher</hi> hath since that time
remembred (to wit) that <hi>D. White</hi> alleaged something
out of <hi>Abulensis</hi> in <hi>Matt.</hi> 7. 19. which <hi>M. Fisher</hi> differred
to make answere vnto, vntil he might see the Author
himself, hauing had experience inough, how falsely
many Ministers the Authors, and how false their
Note-Bookes be. Now <hi>M. Fisher,</hi> hath seene the
booke, and findeth the words cited by <hi>D. White</hi> to
contayne two parts; one, as contrary to <hi>D. White</hi> as the
other seemeth contrary to <hi>M. Fisher,</hi> &amp; that the whole
discourse of <hi>Abulensis</hi> in that place, sheweth that euen
that part which seemeth contrary to <hi>M. Fisher,</hi> doth
nothing preudice <hi>M. Fishers</hi> cause, as will appeare
to any that will duly ponder all that is there sayd of
the Authority of the Church, in defining what bookes
be, and what be not Canonicall. For <hi>Abulensis</hi> expressly
declareth, that all, and only those bookes are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
Canonicall. which the church doth define to
be canonicall: and the reason why he did (in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:27141:26"/>
opinion) thinke one, or two Bookes not to be
canonicall, which we do now hold for canonicall, is,
for that the Church had not then so cleerely defined
them to be Canonicall, as it hath done since A<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>„Äà‚Ä¶„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>sts
wrot that passage as there are diuers other Bookes held
for Canonicall, euen by <hi>Protestants,</hi> which haue not
beene so esteemed by some of the Ancient Fathers, in
regard the church had not then so clearely defined
them to be canonicall, as is hath done in after times.</p>
            <p>A third obiection was made by <hi>D. White</hi> about <hi>the
worship of Images,</hi> which <hi>D. White</hi> would needs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
to be an <hi>Innouation, and gross<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> Error of Papists:</hi>
Which <hi>M. Fisher</hi> denied, and sayd, that the worship
(meaning the same worship which is due to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totypon)
is not giuen by vs to the Image it selfe.
This obiection <hi>D. White</hi> vrged no further the first
day; but the next day of meeting, he vrged those words
of <hi>Bellarmine, Datur veneratio ipsi imagini. M. Fisher</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered,
that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> did not meane that the same
worship, which was due to the <hi>Prototypon,</hi> was giuen
to the Image it selfe, but an inferior degree of worship,
and that also for the <hi>Prototypons</hi> sake.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>D. White</hi> betooke himselfe to <hi>Suares,</hi> saying:
That <hi>Suares</hi> did hold, that the same worship which
was giuen to the <hi>Prototypon,</hi> was giuen to the Image.
M. <hi>Fisher</hi> answering, sayd: You do not vnderstand our
Authors: For, sayd <hi>M. Fisher,</hi> they that seeme to giue
most, giue the least to Images; for those that say that
one and the same worship is giuen to the Image, and
that which is represented by it, hold the Image to be
incapable of any part of worship, and so the whole to
pertayne to the thing: Wheras others who distinguish
one honour to be due to the thing, and another farre
inferior to be giuen to the Image, giue something, as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:27141:26"/>
               <hi>M. Fisher</hi> explicated in the example of the respect one
beareth to the picture of his friend, which although it
be not capable of that friendly respect, and affection
which by looking vpon it, he exciteth in himselfe
towards his friend represented by it; yet is it capable
of an inferiour degree of respect, as to be set in a more
worthy and eminent place &amp;c. then it should be, if
it were the picture of some other, who were not ones
friend.</p>
            <p>These be the chiefe Passages of this Conference
between <hi>D. White,</hi> and <hi>M. Fisher,</hi> so far as hath come
to my notice, who haue vsed so much diligence in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
the truth of this matter, as I haue no doubt,
but for substance I haue not omitted any thing that
may much import, considering what the occasion, and
subiect of the Conference was; to wit, that Paper
written by <hi>M. Fisher,</hi> in which he proued the <hi>Roman
Church,</hi> and those who agree in Fayth with it, to be
that Company, of whome euery one must learne what
is the truth, in all points and questions of Fayth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to saluation: which paper not being substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
confuted, as it was not, by any thing sayd by <hi>D.
White,</hi> or any other at that time or after, <hi>D. Whyte</hi> is yet
obliged to make a better answere, if he meane to giue
satisfaction either to Catholiques or Protestants in this
most important point of a perpetually visible church,
of which all forts must learne true, diuine, infallible
Faith, necessary to Saluation.</p>

OF THE

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>ENTLE Reader, I think
it needful to let thee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that whereas
the Chaplaine of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
B. sayth: (in
the Preface of his Answere to a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what passed betweene the said
B. and <hi>M. Fisher,) That the Iesuite spread
abroad papers of this Conference, which were
full of partiality to his cause, more full of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumney
against the B.</hi> the truth is, that the
Iesuite did not at all, so much as in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:27141:28"/>
speach, &amp; much lesse in papers publish
this, or either of the other two Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
which he had with <hi>D. White,</hi>
vntill he was forced vnto it, by false
Reports giuen out about them, to his
priuate disgrace, and to the preiudice of
the Catholique Cause. Neither then
did he spread papers abroad, but only
deliuered a very few Copies to speciall
friends; and this not with intent to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate
either the B. or the Doctor,
or to make the papers common, but to
enable his friends to answere and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termaund
such false Reportes, as they
had heard, or might heare. Which being
so, I do not see, how the Chaplaine can
free himself from the faults of partiality
and Calumny, wherof he doth accuse
the Iesuite, vnles he do (by some other
proofs better then his owne, or his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
bare affirmation) proue, that the
Iesuite spread such papers; shewing also
particulerly wherein he did relate par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:27141:28"/>
to his cause, and calumnlously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the B. I <hi>say relate,</hi> in regard I do
not at this present promise to examine
exactly all doctrines insinuated in the
Iesuits Relation, and impugned by the
Chaplaine (as neither hauing sufficient
leysure, nor commodity of Bookes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
for such a worke;) but the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to haue bene sincere and true, free
from partiality, more free from calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
I vndertake to defend. For which
purpose I thinke best to set downe the
Iesuits Relation (for the most part as I
find it in the Chaplains printed Copie)
in greater letters, and in a lesser letter
the Chaplains chiefest exceptions, and
my answere vnto them.</p>
               <p>I think the Iesuite himself for his
owne particuler respect, could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to let passe this partiall and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Censure of his Relation, suffering
it patiently as one of the ordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions,
which he, and others at this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:27141:29"/>
day endure for the Catholique Faith,
and for that peculiar order of life which
he professeth, vnder the name of the
Society of IESVS; comforting himself
with the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ple of Christ his Apostles,<note place="margin">Act. 5. 41.</note>
                  <hi>who reioyced that they were thoughts worthy
to suffer Contumely, for the name of Iesus.</hi>
In this respect I say, I suppose the Iesuite
himself could be content, that nothing
were said to the Chaplaines Censure:
But considering the hurt which may
come to the common cause by his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust
disgrace, I haue thought it necessary
to defend the sincerity and truth of his
Relation, and some of the chief heads of
doctrine conteined in it, to the intent
that hereby men may be moued better
to trust what he hath written hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
or may write hereafter, in defence
of the Catholique Faith &amp; Church; &amp;
lesse trust his Aduersaries, who without
iust cause do so much endeauour to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate
his person, or writinges.</p>

all the speach was about
particuler matters, &amp; little or nothing
about a Continuall, Infallible, Visible

point in which a certaine Lady requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

vpon them to<note n="a" place="margin">To wit absolutly &amp; to rely vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> their priuate iudgment, so, as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture Sal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uation vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> it alone, or chiefly.</note> iudge of particulers,

This La. therefore hauing heard it
graunted in the first Conference, that
there must be a continual, visible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
euer since Christ, teaching vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
doctrine, in all points Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,

Fisher</hi> of speaking distractedly But I note herein, that <hi>M.

But when he speaketh of what <hi>D. Whyte</hi> or L.

Visible Church, in which one
may, and out of which one cannot, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Saluation. And therefore hauing
appointed a time of meeting betwixt a
certaine B. and my selfe, and thereupon
hauing sent for the B and me, before
the B. came, the La. &amp; a friend of hers
came first to the roome where I was, &amp;
debated before me the aforesaid Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
and not doubting of the first part,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:27141:30"/>
to wit, That there must be a Continuall

by <hi>D. VVhite, L. K. &amp;c.</hi> The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
was, which was that Church? The
La. friend would needs defend, that not
only the Romane, but also the Greeke
Church was right. I told him, that the
Greeke Church had plainely changed,
and taught false in a point of doctrine
concerning the Holy Ghost, and that
I had heard say, that euen his Maiesty
should say, <hi>The Greeke Church hauing
erred against the Holy Ghost, had lost the
Holy Ghost.</hi> The La. friend not knowing
what to answere, called in the Bishop;
who sitting downe first<note n="c" place="margin">The Chaplaine taxeth the Iesuite, as if in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell he did insult: and saith it was the B. his modesty to vse this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, and to say <hi>there were a hundred schollars better then he.</hi> But I do not see any Insultation, but a simple &amp; true nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of what was sayd: Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I see lesse mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty in the Iesuits pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring a thousand before him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, then in the B. his preferring a hundred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore himself.</note> excused him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

studied in Controuersies, and desiring
that in case he should faile, yet the

to maintaine it then he. To which
I said, there were a thousand better
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:27141:31"/>
schollers then I, to maintaine
the Catholique cause.</p>
            <p>Then the Question about the
Greek Church being<note n="d" place="margin">The Chaplaine tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, that the Iesuite sayd, that what the B. would not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in this, he would <hi>wring &amp; extort from him:</hi> But these words, of <hi>wringing &amp; extorting</hi> the Iesuite neuer vseth, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to his meanest Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, &amp; therfore not likely to haue vsed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to the B. but at most, that he would euince, by argument, or such like.</note> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
I said as before, that it had

                  <p>The Chaplaine faith, <hi>the B. was not so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory: his speach was, that diuers learned men, &amp; some of your owne are of opinion (as the Greeks expressed themselues) it was a question not simply fundamentall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Iesuite cannot reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ber the B. to haue said these words; yet if he did, the Iesuite did not much misse of the chiefe point of the B. his meaning, which was by the distinction of Faith funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall and not fundamentall, to defend the error of the Graecians not to be such (although held against the knowen definitiue sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Church) as doth hinder saluation, or exclude them from being members of the true Church.

            <p>The B. answered; That
to the Booke of Articles
<note n="n" place="margin">
                  <p>This Answer hath reference to that sense which the question had of <hi>Onely English Protestantes,</hi> and not of all English Protestants, out of such as the B. and others are, who by office are teachers of Protestant doctrine, who do either sweare to the booke of Articles, or by subscribing oblige themselues to teach that, and no contrary doctrine. But if the Chaplain (to discredit the Relation) will needs inforce a larger extent of the sense, contrary to the meaning of him that made the answere, and him that asked the Question, who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood one another in that sense which I haue declared; he must know, that although none do sweare or subscribe besides the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish clergy to the Book of Articles, yet all who wilbe accounted members of, or to haue communion with one and the same English Protestant church, are bound eyther to hold all those Articles, or at least not to hold contrary to any one of them, in regard the English Protestant church doth exclude euery one from their church by Excommunication <hi>ipso facto,</hi> as appeareth in their book of Canons. <hi>Can.</hi> 5. <hi>Who shall hold any thing contrary to any part of the said Articles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So as, in this respect I do not see, why any one who pretendeth to be of one and the same Protestant communion with the church of England, can be sayd not to be obliged to hold one, and the same doctrine which is in the <hi>book of Articles,</hi> not onely as the chaplaine sayth, <hi>in chiefest doctrines</hi> (which like a cheuerell point may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged to more by those who agree in more, and straitned to fewer by those who agree in fewer points) but absolutly in all points, and not to hold contrary to any one, or any the least part of any one of them.

I asked, how<note n="p" place="margin">The Iesuite did not aske this question as doubting of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine authority of Scripture, but to make it seene, that beside scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which the B. sayd was the <hi>Onely</hi> foundation of Faith, there must be admitted some other foundation, to wit, <hi>Vnwritten</hi> Tradition, and this of infallible authority, to assure vs infallibly that these Bookes are diuine; which to be diuine is one point infallibly belieued by diuine, Faith, and yet cannot be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly proued out of <hi>Onely</hi> Scripture; therefore <hi>Onely</hi> Scripture can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be sayd (as the B. said) to be the <hi>Onely</hi> foundation of Fayth, or of euery point belieued by Faith. I hope the Chaplaine (who is so carefull to auoyd all suspition of being familiar with impiety, as he would haue no question moued about this point vpon any termes or pretence) will not be so impious as to say, That to belieue these bookes to be diuine scripture, is not a point of diuine Faith; or that this point (being so important as it is, to be most firmely belieued) is belieued by diuine Faith, without any ground or foundation; or wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout a sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t infallible, &amp; diuine foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of Gods word, written or vnwritten. Sith therfore this is a point of Faith, &amp; hath a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea an infallible foundation; it is not against either art, or equity, or piety (for confutation of Error, and confirmation of Truth) to enquire what particuler foundation of Gods word, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or vnwritten, doth assure vs infallibly, that these particuler bookes containe the sole, and whole truth of God, belieued by chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Fayth. Neyther need any be troubled, or endangered by this question, but such as not finding any sufficient foundation in gods word written, do pertinaciously resolue, not to belieue any thing to be Gods word which is not written. Those that belieue that there is a word of God, partly written and partly vnwritten (according to that of <hi>S. Paul</hi> (2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.) <hi>Hold the Traditions whether by our word or Epistle</hi>) do easily, without too much turning in a wheele, or circle, answere the question. See the Reply to <hi>M. Wotton</hi> &amp; <hi>M. White</hi> in the Introduction (of which mention is made in the Relation,) where this, and diuers other important matters pertayning to the drift of this Conference, are handled at large.</note> he knew
Scripture to be Scripture,
and in particuler <hi>Genesis,
Exodus &amp;c.</hi> These are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued

B. said, That the Bookes
of Scripture are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:27141:34"/>
to be supposed, and
needed not to be proued.
Against this I read what
I had formerly written
in my Reply to <hi>M. Iohn
White;</hi> wherin I plainly
in shewed, that this<note n="q" place="margin">
                  <p>The Chaplaine saith, that some body tould him, <hi>that the B. vntied the knot;</hi> But why doth not the Chaplaine tell how he did vntie the knot? It seemeth the knot was not well vntied, when the Iesuite had a Reply so ready, as is insinuated, by his only going againe and reading in the Book which he had so rudely writen. Although a <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognitum</hi> in faith need not be so cleerly knowne as a <hi>praecognitum</hi> in science; yet there must be this proportion, that as <hi>primum praecognitum,</hi> the first thing fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne in a science, must be <hi>prim√≤ cognitum,</hi> first knowne, &amp; must not need another thing pertayning to that science to be <hi>pri√πs cognitum,</hi> knowne before it: So if in Faith, the Scriptures be the first and only foundation, and consequently the first thing knowne, <hi>prim√πm praecognitum,</hi> it must be in Faith <hi>prim√≤ cognitum,</hi> first knowne, and must not need any other thing pertayning to Faith to be <hi>pri√πs cognitum,</hi> knowne before it; &amp; so Church-Tradition, which is one thing pertayning to Fayth, could not (as the Chaplain saith it is, and as indeed it is) be knowne first, and be an Introduction to the knowledge of Scripture. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer like as sciences which suppose a principle proued in a higher science, cannot haue certainty of that principle, but either by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing seene that principle euidently proued by other principles bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed of that higher science, or by giuing credit to some that haue seene, or haue by succession receiued it from others that haue seene it euidently so proued<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> So Faith cannot haue certainty of her first prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, but either by seeing proof from the knowledg of the Blessed, which ordinarily no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> now seeth, or by giuing credit immediatly to some who haue seene, as to Christ who cleerly saw, or to the Apostles to whom cleere reuelation (I say cleere <hi>in attestante</hi>) was made; or by giuing credit to others who by succession haue had it from the first seers. In which last case the certainty of these princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples can be no greater then is the authority of that succession. If it be meerely humane and fallible, the science and Faith is humane and fallible. Neither can either science or Faith be diuine and infallible, vnlesse the authority of that succession be at least in some sort di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and infallible.</p>
                  <p>The chaplain therefore, who (as it seemeth) will not admit church-Tradition to be in any sort diuine and infallible, while it doth introduce the beliefe of scriptures to be diuine bookes, cannot sufficiently defend the Faith introduced of that point to be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, vnles he admit an infallible impulsion of the priuate spirit <hi>ex parte subiecti,</hi> without any infallible sufficiently applied reason <hi>ex parte obiecti,</hi> which he seemeth not, not hath reason to doe <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> this were to open the gap to Enthusiasms of all vpstart Anabaptists, and would take away due proportion of Obiect and Subiect, and the sweet order of things which diuine prouidence hath appointed. It may be, that if he would but consider the Tradition of the Church, not only as of a Company of fallible men, in with sort the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it is but humaine and fallible, but also as it is the Tradition of a Company; which (by it owne light) sheweth it self to be assisted by Christ and his holy Spirit, farre more cleerely then Scripture (by it owne light) doth shew it selfe to be the infallible word of God; he would find no difficulty in that respect to account the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Church-Tradition to be infallible, and consequently not only able to be an Introduction, but also an infallible motiue reason or at least condition <hi>ex Parte obiecti,</hi> to make both it self, and the bookes of Scripture appeare (infallibly, though obscurely) to our soule disposed and illuminated by Gods spirit, to haue in them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and infallible authority, and to be worthy of diuine and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible credit, sufficient to breed in vs diuine and infallible Fayth.</p>
                  <p>Neither do I see why the Chaplain may not consider the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the present Church these two waies, as well as the present scriptures printed and approued by men of this age. For if the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures printed and approued by men of this age must be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, not onely as printed or approued by men, in regard the credit giuen to them thus considered can be no more then humane; but also as printed, and by authority of men assisted by Gods spirit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued to be true copies of that which was first written by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghosts Pen-men, before we can giue infallible credit vnto them; I see no reason, why the like twofold consideration of the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the present church may not be admitted, especially when as the promise of Christ and his holy Spirits continuall presence and assistance (<hi>Luc.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 19. 20. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 14. 16.) was made no lesse (but rather more) expressly to the Apostles and their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours, the lawfully-sent Pastours and Doctours of the Church in all ages, in their teaching by word of mouth; then in writing, or reading, or printing, or approuing copies of what was formerly written by the Apostles.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps the Chaplaine will aske mee, how I know that any church or company of men of this age, or any age since the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, haue promise of christ and his holy spirits assistance? I answer that I know it both by Tradition and Scripture (considered in the twofold manner aforesaid) both which without any vitious circle, mutually confirme the authority of ech other (as a Kings Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors word of mouth, and his Kings letter beare mutuall witnesse of ech other); And I do not want other both outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward arguments or motiues of Credibility, which are sufficient not only to confirme the Fayth of belieuers, but also to perswade well disposed Infidells, that both the one and the other were sent from God, and that one is the infallible word of God, speaking in and by his Legats, the lawfully-sent preachers, of the Church; The other, the infallible word of God speaking in and by his letters the holy scriptures, which he hath appointed his said legats to deliuer and expound vnto vs, and which among other things do warrant that we may heare and giue credit to these Legats of Christ, as to Christ the King himself.</p>

                  <p>What then?

                  <p>This question the Iesuite made chiefly against that part of the B. his last speach, in which he said, <hi>There were er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in doctrine;</hi> for if the B. meant (as the Iesuite vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood him to meane) that there were errours of doctrine of Fayth in the Generall Church, neuer did any lawfull &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Iudge so censure, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it so be. No power in Earth or Hell it self can so far preuayle against the Generall Church of Christ, built vpon a Rock, as to make it, or the pastours thereof erre generally in any one point of diuine truth. Christs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises stand (<hi>Matth, 16. &amp; 28. Luc. 22. Ioan. 14. &amp; 16.</hi>) and will neuer permit this, no not in Antichrists dayes. Particuler Pastors &amp;
and Churches may fall into Heresy or Apostasy, but the whole Church cannot. It may sometyme not expresly teach, or know all diuine truthes, which afterwards it may learne by study of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res and otherwayes; but it neuer did, nor can vniuersally, by its full authority teach any thing to be diuine truth, which is not; and much lesse, any thing to be a matter of Fayth which is contrary to diuine truth, either expressed, or inuolued in Scriptures rightly vnderstood. So as no reformation of Fayth can be needfull in the Generall Church, but only in particuler Churches; in which case also when the need is onely questionable, particuler Pastours or Churches must not take vpon them to iudge, and condemne others of errour in Fayth, but as <hi>S. Irenaus</hi> intimateth, must haue recourse to that Church which hath more powerfull Principality, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to her Bishop being Cheife Pastour of the whole Church, as being Successour to <hi>S. Peter:</hi> To whom Christ promised the Keyes, (<hi>Math.</hi> 16.) For whom Christ prayed, that his Fayth might not faile: (<hi>Luc. 22.</hi>) and whom he charged to confirme his brethren; and to feed and gouerne the whole flock, lambes and sheep (<hi>loan.</hi> 21.) people and Pastours, subiects and superiours; which he shall neuer refuse to do in such sort, as that this neglect shall be a iust Cause for any particuler man or Church to make a schisime or separation of himself and others, from the whole Generall Church, vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Reformation either of manners, or of Fayth.</p>
                  <p>Protestants therefore did ill in first deuiding themselues from the Generall Church, and do still ill in continuing deuided from it. Neither can those Protestants be excused from intolerable pride &amp; insolent madnes, who presume to be Accusers, Witnesses, Iudges, &amp; Executioners of the sentence pronounced by themselues against the Church in Generall, and against the principall and Mother Church, and the B. of Rome, which is, and ought to be their Iudge in this case. For although it be against equity that Subiects and Children should be accusers, witnesses, iudges and executioners against their Prince and Mother in any case; yet it is not absurd that in some case the Prince or Mother may accuse, witnesse, iudge, and (if need be)

Shee<note n="C" place="margin">
                  <p>Heere againe the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
taxeth the Iesuite saying,
<hi>That the B. did not answer thus in

he did; and it appeareth to be
so by the Iesuits wordes who
said to the La. <hi>Marke that.</hi> Vnto
which the B. replied saying, <hi>She may be better saued in it then you;</hi> which
Reply sheweth that the B. had said, that she in particuler might be
saued in the Roman Fayth. Otherwise, if his first Answere had ben
as the chaplaine would now make, the B. should haue said, <hi>The ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
may be saued in it, but neither you, nor she.</hi> But the Iesuite is sure
that this Answere of the B. and Reply of the Iesuite (<hi>Marke that</hi>) was
iust as he related, without any such addition, as now the chaplain
doth relate; and that if such a Caueat were added, it was after the
end of the conference, and not in the Iesuits presence.</p>
                  <p>Out of this last passage the Chaplain obserueth that Catholiques
take aduantage, and make vse of the argument drawne from Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
granting, <hi>That one liuing and dying a Rom. Catholique may be saued;</hi>
accounting it secure so to liue and die, euen by confession of Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.
The force of which argument he endeauoureth to weaken by
saying, that although Protestants grant it to be possible, yet they say
withall that it is not secure, but hard &amp;c. But he must remember,
that when Protestants graunt, that in the Rom. Fayth and Church
there is ground sufficient, and consequently possibility of saluation;
this is a free confession of the Aduersaries argument themselues, and
therefore is of force against them, and is to be thought to be extorted
from them by the force of truth it self. But when Protestants do say<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
that saluation is more securely and easily had in Protestant Fayth &amp;
Church, then in the Romane; this onely is their partiall priuate
opinion in their owne behalf, which is of no weight, especially
when Romane Catholiques farre more in number, and farre more
spread in place, and of much longer continuance in tyme, and for
vertue and learning at least equall, or rather much exceeding Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
do confidently, and vnanimously, and with authority and
reason proue, that (according to the ordinary Course of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence)
<hi>Out of the Cath. Romane Church, there is no possibility of saluation.</hi>
And therefore, who will not thinke it safer to adhere to the Cath. Romane
Fayth and Church, in which all both Catholiques and
best learned Protestants do promise possibility of saluation without
doubt, then to the Protestant Church, sith all Roman Catholiques
do threaten damnation to all who obstinately adhere vnto it; and
dye in it? The which threat, doth not proceede out of malice, or
want of Charity, but is grounded in Charity; as are the like threats
of Christ our Sauiour, and Holy Fathers, who knowing that there
is but <hi>One True Fayth,</hi> and <hi>One True Church,</hi> out of which there is no
saluation, do out of their Charitable care of our soules good, so
commend to vs the beliefe of that Fayth, and the cleauing to that
Church, as they pronounce, <hi>He that shall not belieue, shall be condemned.</hi>
(<hi>Mar.</hi> 16.) and, <hi>He that will not heare the Church,</hi> and haue it for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>is to be accounted as a Heathen and Publican</hi> (Matth. 18.) and cannot
haue God to be his Father; accounting it more charity to fore warne
vs by these threats, of our perill, that we may feare and auoide it,
then to put vs in a false security, and so to let vs runne into danger,
for want of foresight of it.</p>
                  <p>Those examples which the Chaplaine giues of the <hi>Donatists</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
true Baptisme in the opinion of all, and Protestants holding a
kind of <hi>Reall Presence</hi> not denied by any, are nothing like our case.
For in these cases there are annexed other reasons of certainly
knowne perill of damnable schisme and heresie, which we should
incurre by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>senting to the Donatists deniall of true Baptisme to be
among Catholiques; and to the Protestants denyall, or doubting of
the true substantiall presence of Christ in the Eucharist. But in our
case there is confessedly no such perill of any damnable Heresy,
schisme, or any other sinne, in resoluing to liue and die in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Rom. Church: and in case some Protestants should say, that
there is perill of damnation in liuing and dying Roman Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques;
the authority of them that say there is perill, being so few (in
comparison of those who say there is none,) and so passionate and
partially affected men, who are in this their saying contradicted by
their owne more learned brethren, ought not to be respected more

                  <p>
                     <hi>Heere the Chaplain taxeth
the Iesuite for falsly relating</hi>
D. Whites <hi>Answer, and saith he
hath spoken with</hi> D. White,
<hi>who auowes this, &amp; no other
Answere:</hi> He was asked in the
Conference, whether Papists errours
were fundamentall? To this he gaue
answere by a distinction of persons, which held and professed the errours; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely,
that the errours were fundamentall <hi>reductiu√®,</hi> by a reducent, if they
who imbraced them did pertinaciously adhere vnto them, hauing sufficient
meanes to be better informed: Nay further, that they were materially in the
kind and nature of them<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> leauen, drosse, haye, and stubble; yet he thought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
that such as were misled by education, or long Custome, or ouer-valuing
the soueraigntie of the Romane Church, and did in simplicity of heart im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
them, might by their generall Repentance, &amp; faith in the merits of Christ<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
attended with Charity and other vertues, finde mercy at Gods hands. But that
he should say, <hi>signanter &amp; express√®,</hi> that none of yours or your fellowes er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
were damnable, so long as you hold them not against your Conscience, that
he vtterly disauowes &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To this the Iesuite answereth; first, that he did not in this his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
say, that <hi>D. White</hi> did <hi>signanter,</hi> and expresly say these precise
words, <hi>None of yours, or your fellowes errours are damnable.</hi> Secondly, he
saith, that <hi>D. White</hi> did not <hi>signanter,</hi> and expresly make this precise
Answere which now he maketh, nor scarse any part of it; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by the Relation of the first Conference made by the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite
in fresh memory, and conferred with <hi>D. White</hi> himself, who did
not at that time contradict it in this point.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the reason which moued the Iesuite to say, that D. White
had secured him, as is said in this Relation, was for that D. White in
the said first Conference graunted, that there must be one or other
church, continually visible, which had in all ages taught the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
Fayth of Christ in all points fundamentall; and being vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to assigne such a church, D. Whyte expressely graunted that he
could not assigne and shew any church different from the Roman,
which held in all ages all points fundamentall. Whence the Iesuite
gathered his opinion to be, that the Roman church held and taught
in all ages vnchanged Fayth in all fundamentall points, and did
not in any age erre in any point fundamentall. Whereupon the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite
asked, whether errours in points not fundamentall were dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable?
D. White answered, they were not, so long as one did not
hold them against his conscience; which Answere he repeated
againe to M. B. asking the same question. Out of all which, the
Iesuite did collect, that D. Whites opinion was, that the Roman
church held all points fundamentall, and only erred in points not
fundamentall, which he accounted not damnable, so long as one
did not hold them against his conscience: and thereuppon the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
might well say, that D. White had giuen security to him, who
holdeth no Faith different from the Roman, nor contrary to his
owne conscience.</p>
                  <p>As for D. Whites saying he could discerne but small loue of truth,
and few signes of grace in the Iesuite, I will let it passe as the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of an Aduersary, looking vpon the Iesuite with eyes of dislyke,
which is not to be regarded further then to returne vpon him (not a
like censure, but) a charitable wish, that he may haue no lesse loue
of truth, nor fewer signes of grace, then the Iesuite is thought to
haue, by those who know him better then D. White doth.</p>

asked, Whether she might
be saued in the Protestant
Fayth? Vpon my<note n="e" place="margin">
                  <p>The Chaplain noteth, that
the B. was confident, and had
reason of his confidence. For
sayth he, <hi>To belieue the Scripture
and Creed in the sense of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Primitiue Church; to receiue
the first fowre Generall Councells
so much magnified by Antiquity: To
belieue all points of doctrine generally receiued, as fundamentall, in the
Church of Christ, is a Fayth, in which to liue and dye, cannot but giue sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</hi>
And I would fayne see, sayth the chaplain, any one point
maintained by the church of England, that can be proued to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from the foundation.</p>
                  <p>To which I answer, first, that if to say thus be a sufficient cause of
confidence, I meruayle why the chaplain maketh such difficulty to
be confident of the saluation of <hi>Rom. Catholiques,</hi> who belieue all
this in a farre better maner then Protestants do: neyther can they be
proued to depart from the foundation so much as Protestants do,
who denying infallible authority to all the Pastours of the cath.
church assembled in a Generall councell, do in effect deny Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to the whole catholique church, which is bound to heare &amp;
belieue what is defined, and to practise what is prescribed by her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
in a generall councell, and ordinarily doth so belieue and
practise.</p>
                  <p>Secondly I aske, how Protestants, who admit no certaine and
infallible meanes and rule of Fayth, beside onely Scripture, can be
infallibly sure that they belieue the same entier scripture and creed,
and the foure first Generall councels &amp;c. in the same vncorrupted
sense which the Primitiue Church belieued? What text of scripture
doth tell, that Protestants who now liue, do belieue all this, or that
all this is expressed in those particuler Bibles, or in the writings of
the Fathers or Councells which now are in the Protestants handes,
or that Protestants do rightly vnderstand the sense of all which is
expressed in their bookes according to that which was vnderstood
by the Primitiue Church, and the Fathers which were present at the
foure first Generall Councells? Or that all, and onely those points
which Protestants do account to be fundamentall and necessary to
be expresly knowne by all, were so accounted by the Primitiue
Church? I suppose, neither the B. nor the Chaplain can produce
any text of scripture sufficient to assure one of all this: And therefore
he had need to seeke some other Infallible rule and meanes, by
which he may know these things infallibly, or els he hath no reason
to be so confident, as to aduenture his soule, that one may be saued
liuing and dying in the Protestant Fayth.</p>

(said the B.) you may.
Vpon my<note n="f" place="margin">
                  <p>Heere I note, that the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite
was as confident for his
part, as the B. for his; but
with this difference, that the
B. had not sufficient reason
of his Confidence as I haue
declared; But the Iesuite had
so much reason both out of
expresse scriptures and Fathers, and the infallible authority of the
Church, that the B. himself then did not, nor his Chaplaine now
doth not, taxe the Iesuit of any rashnes: but the Chaplain expresly
graunteth that, There is but one sauing Faith, and the B. did (as was
related) graunt that the La. might be saued in the Rom. Fayth;
which is as much as the Iesuite did take vpon his soule. Onely the
chaplain saith, without any proofe, that we haue many dangerous
errours: but he neither tels vs which they be, nor why he thinketh
them dangerous, but leaueth vs to look to our owne soules, and so
we do, and haue no cause to doubt; because we do not hold any
new deuise of our owne, or any other man, or any thing contrary,
but all most conformable to scriptures interpreted by Vnion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of Fathers, and definitions of Councells.</p>
                  <p>Which being so, the B. and his chaplaine had need to looke to
their soules, for if there be but one sauing Fayth, as the Chaplain
graunteth, (and he hath reason, because <hi>S. Paul</hi> sayth (<hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.) <hi>Vna
fides,</hi> One Fayth: and <hi>S. Leo,</hi> (<hi>serm. de Natiuit.</hi>) <hi>Nisi vna est fides, non est,</hi>
vnlesse it be <hi>One,</hi> it is not Fayth) and this <hi>One Fayth</hi> was once the
Roman, which also yet is (as the B. graunteth) a sauing Fayth; (or
else he ought not to haue granted, that one may be saued liuing &amp;
dying in it:) I see not how they can haue their soules saued without
they entirely imbrace this Fayth, being the Cath. Fayth, which as
<hi>S. Athanasius</hi> (<hi>in Symb.</hi>) affirmeth, vnles one hold entiere (that is euery
point of it,) and inuiolate, (that is, belieuing all in right sense, and
for the true formall reason of diuine reuelation sufficiently applied
to our vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ding by the Infallible authority of the Cath. Church
proposing to vs by her Pastours this reuelation) without doubt he
shall perish for euer. In which sort if the B. and his chaplain did
belieue any one Article, they (finding the same formall reason in
all, and applyed sufficiently by the same meanes to all) would easily
belieue all. But so long as they do not belieue all in this sort, but
will, as all Heretiques do, make choyse of what they will, and
what they will not belieue, without relying vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the Infallible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Cath. Church, they cannot haue that <hi>One Soule-sauing
Fayth,</hi> which all good Catholique Christians haue, in any one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of Fayth. For although they belieue the same truth, which other
good Catholiques do in some Articles, yet not belieuing them for
the same formall reason of diuine reuelation, sufficiently applyed
by Infallible Church-authority, but either for some other formall
reason, or at least not for this reason sufficiently applyed, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be sayd to haue one and the same Infallible diuine Fayth which
other good catholique christians haue, who do belieue those Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
not for any other formall reason beside the diuine reuelation
applyed sufficiently and made knowne to them (not by their owne
fancie, or the fallible authority of humaine deductions,) but by the
infallible authority of the church of God, that is of men infallibly
assisted by the Spirit of God, as all lawfully called, continued, and
confirmed Generall councells are assisted.</p>
                  <p>Whence I gather, that although euery thing defined to be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
truth in Generall councells, is not absolutly necessary to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
knowne and actually belieued (as some other truthes are)
by all sorts; yet no man may (after knowledge that they are thus
defined) doubt deliberatly, and much lesse obstinatly deny the
truth of any thing so defined. For, euery such doubt and denyall is a
breach from that one sauing Fayth, which other good christians
haue, in regard it taketh away infallible credit from the church; and
so the diuine reuelation being not by it sufficiently applyed, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
according to the ordinary course of Gods prouidence breed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
belief in vs; for as <hi>S. Paul Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>saith, How shall they belieue
vnles they heare, how shall they heare without a Preacher, how shall they preach</hi>
(to wit infallibly) <hi>vnles they be sent,</hi> to wit, from God, and infallibly
assisted by his spirit? And if a whole Generall councell defining
what is diuine truth be not belieued to be sent, and assisted by gods
spirit, and consequently of Infallible credit, what man in the world
can be said to be of infallible credit? or if such a Councell lawfully
called, continued, and confirmed may erre, in defining any one
diuine truth, how can we be Infallibly certaine of any other truth
defined by it? for if it may erre in one, why not in another and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and so in all? or how can we (according to the ordinary course)
be infallibly assured, that it erreth in one, and not in another, when
it equally, by one and the same authority, defineth both to be diuine
truthes? for if we leaue this to be examined by any priuate man, this
examination not being infallible had need to be examined by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and this by another, without end, or euer coming to infallible
Certainty, necessarily required in that One Fayth which is necessary
to saluation, and to that peace and Vnity which ought to be in
the Church? It is not therefore (as the Chaplain would perswade)
the fault of councells definitions (but the pride of such as will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr,
and not submit their priuate Iudgments) that lost, &amp; continueth
the losse of peace and vnity of the Church, and the want of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
in that one aforesaid soule-sauing Fayth: the which how far
it doth extend is indeed (as the Chaplain <hi>pag.</hi> 73. confesseth) no
work for his penne, but is to be learned of that one Holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
Apostolique, alwayes Visible, and Infallible Roman Church,
of which the La. once doubting, resteth now fully satisfied, that in it
she may learne all truth necessary to saluation, and that out of it
there is no ordinary meanes sufficient to teach her the right way of
saluation. And therefore the Iesuit might well say, as he did in the
Relation, that the La. was by this &amp; a former conference, satisfied of
the truth of Roman Religion.</p>
