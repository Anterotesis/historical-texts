            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſhall be repreſented unto you the immediate anger of God in
great Charactes of blood is moſt appearently to be read.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Garraton</hi> a Towne in <hi>Leiceſter</hi>-ſhire, not far from <hi>Lough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi>
is a great pond of water, which for many generations
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113235:2"/>
hath beene knowne to be there time out of mind, it is above an
Acre on the length, and about an Acre in the bredth. It was
made at firſt to ſatisfie the thirſt of the Cattle, which from the
commons and paſtures thereabouts did daily reſort unto it and
ſometimes it allayed the drought of the poore and thirſty tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailer,
but now (as if it were another element,) it altread both
its nature and complexion, for the beaſts did refuſe to drinke
thereof and ſome few dayes afterwards being paſſed they would
not come neere the water, which the Countrymen and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
who were owners of the Cattle thereabouts perceiving
they repayred to the pond to ſee what tht reaſon of this ſtrange
thing ſhould be.</p>
            <p>Being come unto the pond they found the colour of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
changed, for it began to looke red, and the ſubſtance thereof,
was thicker then before, amazed at the nouelty of this ſight they
departed from the place, they make a relation of it to their friends
and one neighbour brings in another to behold this wonderfull
chance.</p>
            <p>The noyſe is ſpread over all the Country, and in thronging
numbers they make haſte to ſee it. The water which at the firſt
began to looke but reddiſh, doth now looke higher and higher,
and as the people came in it did increaſe in colour. This conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
for the ſpace of foure dayes, the Country farre and neere
(who had notice of it) comming in to be ſpectatiors of it. It
waxed more red the ſecond day then it ſeemed at the firſt, and
farre more red the third day then it did of the ſecond, and on
the fourth day it grew a perfect ſanguine.</p>
            <p>There is no wonder in this nature but carrieth ſome divotion
in it, the people ſtand round about the bankes of the pond, and
from looking on the water they look up to heaven from whence
they believe that the wonder came; with reverence they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
this miracle of the water turned into wine, but of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
turned into blood they never heard of that wonder before.
Some of them more hardy then the reſt would undertake to
taſte of it, to underſtand if it were already as much in taſte as in
complection, but they were ſeverely charged by thoſe that did
ſtand by them, and were told that they might follow the more

wiſe example of the beaſts for ſince the Cattle refuſed to drink
of the water by ſo doing they would now ſhew themſelves more
brutiſh then the Beaſts.</p>
            <p>The water ſtill continueth in its bloody colour and had all
one ſtanding face of blood, and with all it ſeemed ſo thick that
if a high wind had blown it is believed that it would very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at all or elſe very gently have moved Every day brought in
new obſervers to behold this admirable poole, and who had but
feeue it the day before could not be content with one dayes,
wonder, but muſt come the next day to behold it againe.</p>
            <p>It was the object of all the eyes thereabouts, and on their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
homewards the ſubject of all their diſcourſe. The Knights
the Gentlemen, and the Ladies the Peaſants, and their Families
ſtood all cloſſe together round about it, and being overcome
with the amazement of the ſight there was regard unto degrees
or diſtinction of perſons, and it ſeemes they learned this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
from the Pond which they now made uſe of. <hi>That
they were all but one blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the obſervation of the blood they fall into the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
at laſt of the bloody times, where in they live, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo neere to <hi>Lough borough</hi> they grow in diſcourſe of how
much blood hath beene ſpilt by the Lord of <hi>Loughborough</hi> his
meanes who being there the great Agent for the King hath
robbed many houſekeepers in thoſe parts of their goods and
their treaſure and which is far more deare to them many of their
Childrens lives.</p>
            <p>Report in the way is made how many families hath he robbed
of their fathers, and how many he hath left without their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,

fought and all the ſieges that have bin laid and raiſed and paſſing
from one devovring buiſneſſe to another, they do curſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of the civill warre.</p>
            <p>The true narration of this water turned into blood may be
put into ſucceding calanders, and it may be printed in its owne
rubrick, in our dayes did this prodigious ſight appeare and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
the crimſin colour of the pond did begin to change, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113235:3"/>
every day to looke paler and paler untill at lenght it by degree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
turned unto its firſt complection of water the bloody ſubſtance
ſinking downe, and by its owne weight ſettling it ſelfe in the
bottome of the pond. In the meane time the rumor of this fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up and downe the Country, there being above one thouſand
witneſſes to juſtifie the truth of it, one Maſter <hi>Neale</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of good account living at great <hi>Leake</hi> in <hi>Nottingham-ſhire,</hi>
being travailing on his occaſion unto <hi>London,</hi> and hearing the
report of it to be commonly ſpoken as he did ride upon the
way thought it was foure miles out o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the rod, he reſolued to ſee
it and making haſte he eaſily overcome the lenght of the way,
out of a deſire to in enjoy the nouelty of the ſight being avived
he ſat a long time on horſeback at the entrance into the Pond
muſing and looking on it, (for it was juſt at that time) when the
water did begin to returne to its firſt complection and perce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the red ſubſtance in the nature of a filmy body to deſcend
towards the bottome, he did put ſpurres unto his horſe who did
fling back and ſnorted and was unwilling to goe into the Pond,
but after he had forced him to enter a little way into it, and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
towards the bottome of the water with his Cane he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
clots as it were of congealed blood in great abundance to
riſe up and having ſtayed upon the top of the water for a little
ſpace to deſcend afterwards by degrees againe.</p>
            <p>Not able to ſatisfie himſelfe with any reaſon from whence
this wonder ſhould ariſe, he departed but the Country people
reſoluing to examine and dive into the cauſe thereof, they had a
meeting amongſt themſelves for that intent and concluded at it
to have the pond dreyned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It being beleeved that the enemy had
throwne ſome Carcaſſes into the pond to ſtayne the water, and
to bring thereby ſome ſuddaine diſtruction upon the Cattle.</p>
            <p>This beleeve being entertained, the ſluce is opened and now
the water comes trumbling forth as if it were glad of its liberty,
and was afraid to ſtay any longer in the portentous place where
before it was in a ſwift to rent it made good its paſſage as if one
part were emulation to overtake the other, and the latter ſtrove
with the former for the honour of proceeding. And to perfect
the worke wherein ſome deeper places of the pond, the water
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113235:4"/>
ſtood ſtill, and could not diſadvantage it ſelfe into the chennell,
the Countrym<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n ſome with ſcoopes and ſome with pailes did
carry forth the water, with many hands they overcame the task
which ſeemed at firſt almoſt impoſſible. And the pond being
drayned and found nothing but fiſh of which in divers kinds
there were great ſtore, &amp; thoſe fiſh ſeemed ſtill to be very good
and nothing the worſe for that miraculous accident which had
made red the water. We may learne by this what God can doe
who in a moſt wonderfull way can expreſſe his power without 
the leaſt dammage to the Creatures.</p>
            <p>Howſoever the pond being drayned dry which may increaſe
the wonder, the blood in many places was diſcovered in extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
degrees to be like ſo many ſcarlet Carpots on the bottome
of the poole, to the unſpeakeable amazement of the beholders,
and indeed they may well put wonder on, for though in out
owne Chronicles &amp; in other Hiſtories we have read ſometimes
of Clouds that have rayned dropes of blood, which though it is
very wonderfull, yet becauſe Pheloſophers have undertake to
give a naturall reaſon for it, it ſubſtracteth ſome thing from the
greatneſſe of the wonder, but this as no cauſe can be aſſigned for
it, ſo no ſtory that I remember can example it, but being as farre
beyond nature as example it ſheweth it ſelfe to proceed from
the immediate power and the hand of God.</p>
            <p>I will not preſume to give you the interpretation of it not
ſay it is ſuitable to the preſent condition of theſe bleeding times,
neither will I be ſo hardy as to affirme that the foure dayes
wherein the water every day ſeemed to increaſe in the redneſſe
of its colour doth ſignifie the foure years of the war which now
are already or neere expired and that as the water every day for
the foure dayes exceeded one another in the deſines of its ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine
dye, it looking every day redder then before, ſo the watre
for theſe foure yeares hath every yeare beene one yeare more
bloody then the other, ſurely it will prove good newes could I
from hence aſſure you that as after the foure dayes being ended,
the water did begin to returne in its firſt genuine colour, ſo the
fourth yeare of this war being expired, the Kingdome ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
returne to its ancient bleſsing and habit of peace, and that

as the water bringing its firſt cleanes the blood did ſinke downe
and vaniſh away, ſo now the crying ſins of blood ſhall be waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away from this Kingdome by the cleanes of a new life and by
the teares of true repentance.</p>
            <p>There were many of the towne of Carraton both men and
women, and of the inhabitants of the Country thereabouts who
dipped their handkechers in this pond when it was of a bloodly
colour, and the linnen retayning the complection of blood, it
will be a teſtimoniall to ſucceeding times of this moſt ſtrange
and wonderfull accident and of the truth of what we write.</p>
            <p>But to give you a good pond to all theſe wonderfull events,
we have received intelligence and it is confidently reported that
the King having of late received to many overthrowes, and loſſe
upon loſſe and deſpairing of and ſucceſſe by Armes, hath now
ſent unto the Parliament at Weſtminſter to deſire hoſtages for
the ſecurity of his perſon, that he may come and ſit among them
to compoſe the differences of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>It it the deſire of many thouſands that His Majeſty may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in this happy reſolution, and that after ſo many deffiulties
and dangers paſt, and ſo much blood ſpilt he might at lenght by
the mercy of God returne and be reconciled to his Parliament,
and to this there is no good Subject (unleſſe he be a deſperate
Malignant or ſome arch Papiſt) but will ſay Amen.</p>
            <p>In theſe ſad dayes when the voyce of Gods wrath are poured
forth on the face of the whole Earth wonders were never more
frequent. Every day almoſt bringeth forth ſome new Miracle.</p>
            <p>In Shoolane London, on Tueſday September ſixteene there
was a monſtrou<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and prodigious Birth of which the good-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was delivered with infinet paine and danger. It ſeemed to
be as it were two children the one ariſing from upper monſtrous
part of the other, the firſt child out of which the other lid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
had neither head not feet, but was onely content with
thighes and two-ſtumps for leggs, neither had it any armes but
two imperfect branches came from the ſhoulders of it which
had no hands at all.</p>
            <p>The nailes both for the hands &amp; foot in a ſormidable length
and ſhapeneſſe did grow out of the hipps on each ſide to the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113235:5"/>
great amazement of the beholders: It had no head, but in Head
thereof there did ariſe from the neck a great and hollow lumpe
of fleſh, and from thence did proceed another birth in the ſhape
of a man child, and perfect in every limb, it was but little but
very lovely to behold, ſpare and leane and its feet were faſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the hollow trunke which grew about the neck of the other
monſter out of which it doth appeare the whole body doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
it is crediable that it received its originall and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of its growth from the imperfect ruines of the other which
(as I have ſaid) having neither head nor feet, receive perfect
ſhapes in all other parts the armes onely excepted, and it was
very plumpe and fat, and (as it ſeemed) deſigned by nature a
female. Theſe birth, do carry with them remarkable obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſad and monſterous times muſt labour ſtill with ſad and
monſtrous births and this (as it was ſtill-borne) was expoſed
unto puplick veiw to the infinet amazement of the beholders
and to the great griefe of the Parents.</p>
