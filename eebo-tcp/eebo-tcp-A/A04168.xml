            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

minde; let each eſteeme others better than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Looke not every man on his owne things, but every man alſo on the things of others. Let this minde be in you, which was alſo in</hi> Chriſt Jeſus: <hi>who being in the forme of God, thought it not robbery to be equall with God: But made himſelfe of no reputation, and took upon him the forme of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſſe of men. And being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelfe, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſſe.</hi> If we conſider this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation of Chriſt our Saviour in its generall or abſtract notion, not as reſtrained unto particular circumſtances of his death and ſufferings, it is in ſome ſort more peculiar to him as hee was and is the Son of God, than the matter of any other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle following in this Creed. For when wee ſay (as we muſt beleeve) that the onely Son of God was borne, was circumciſed, did ſuffer under <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate,</hi> was crucified dead and buried, theſe and the like ſpeeches can be no other wayes verified of him, as he is God, than <hi>per communicationem idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omatum</hi>: That is, the matters ſignified by theſe and the like ſpeeches had their beginning and reall exiſtence in his humane nature. For <hi>that</hi> alone was really capable of weakneſſe, ſorrow, infirmity, and of death: Yet in as much as the whole humane nature it ſelfe was but an Appendix of his divine perſon, (no perſon diſtinct from it) whatſoever Chriſt Jeſus did doe or ſuffer in this nature, was done, and ſuffered by the eternall Sonne of God. The Sonne of God was truely humbled, in, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this nature in all his naturall, and more
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7892:7"/>
than naturall ſufferings, from his birth to his death. Yet may we not ſay, that this Son of God did humble himſelfe onely in theſe or the like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, whereof the humane nature alone was really capable. That <hi>exinanition,</hi> or nullifying of himſelfe, mentioned by our Apoſtle (<hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7.) did not take its beginning from or in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but in and from the divine perſon of the Sonne of God. For it was no phyſicall paſſion or naturall affection, no paſſion at all, either naturall or ſupernaturall, yet a true and proper humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more than civill, though better reſembled by humiliation civill, than by naturall. His obedience did not meerely conſiſt in his patient ſuffering, but in the ſubmiſſion of himſelfe to his Fathers will, before he ſuffered. Moſt willing he was to take upon him the forme of a ſervant, before hee actually tooke our nature upon him for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; before the Angell <hi>Gabriell</hi> was ſent unto the bleſſed Virgin; before the <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 40. ver. 6, 7, 8.</note> Pſalmiſt had ſaid on his behalfe, <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou wouldeſt not: but a bodie haſt thou prepared me; in burnt offerings and ſacrifice for ſinne thou haſt had no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: then ſaid I, loe I come; in the volume of the book it is written of me: I delight to doe thy will, O God.</hi> This unconceiveable manner of his unexpreſſible willingneſſe to doe his Fathers will, was the very life and ſoule of that moſt admirable obedience of his humane will to doe and ſuffer whatſoever hee did or ſuffered in our fleſh: That, which gave the infinite value, and everlaſting efficacy to his everlaſting ſacrifice, which was offred once for all.</p>

                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:7892:8"/>2. For taking a true, though an imperfect ſcale (for ſuch is the beſt that man can take) of his humiliation and obedience, wee are to ſcan the meaning of our Apoſtle in the forecited place more particularly. Hee was, ſaith our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>in the forme of God</hi>; the originall implyeth the very eſſence or nature of God. As much as wee are taught to beleeve in the <hi>Nicene</hi> or <hi>Athanaſius</hi> Creed, where it is ſaid, <hi>Hee was of one ſubſtance with the Father, &amp;c.</hi> He was ſo in the <hi>forme</hi> of God, or ſo truely God, <hi>that he thought it no robbery,</hi> (no uſurpation of any dignity which was not his owne by right of nature) to account him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe equall with God. It was no robbery ſo to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count himſelfe, becauſe hee knew himſelfe ſo to be. Yet ſaith the Apoſtle, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>he did</hi> (as it were) <hi>empty</hi> himſelfe, or ſequeſter this his great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe, and became leſſe, or lower than the ſons of men, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, by taking upon him the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall <hi>ſtate</hi> or <hi>condition</hi> of a ſervant: being firſt made ſubſtantially man, that hee might be for a time <hi>eſſentially</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> a ſervant. For though every man be not a ſervant, yet every ſervant muſt be a man. Now the Son of God being thus found in the forme and garbe of a man, and in the <hi>formall</hi> condition of a ſervant, <hi>He humbled himſelfe yet lower, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſſe.</hi> And that was a kind of death unto which by the Roman Laws, (whereunto he yeelded obedience) none but ſlaves, or malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of ſervile condition were lyable. And how ever, many of this ſtate or condition, were put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7892:8"/>
this ignominious death; yet none beſides the man <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> did ever ſuffer it out of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or willingly, but for want of power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt or eſchew it. Had it beene in the power of the moſt abject ſlaves that ever did ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it, to have called in but half ſo many Roman ſoldiers to their reſcue, as <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> could have commanded of celeſtiall Angels, they would have ſould their lives at a dearer rate, than the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors did, which were ſlain in battaile or mutiny.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But the man CHRIST JESUS, who was alſo the true Sonne of God, and who in that hee was the wiſedome of God, did better know the horror or paines of a lingring death before he had experience of it as man, than any creature man or Angell, can doe: when HE <hi>was afflicted and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, yet he opened not his mouth; but was brought</hi> (unto his Croſſe) <hi>like a Lambe unto the ſlaughter, and as a ſheepe before his ſhearer is dumbe, ſo opened he not his mouth. Iſa.</hi> 53.7. This far exceeded all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of any man whether free borne, or a ſlave. His patience in all his ſufferings did farre exceed the patience of dumb creatures, of Lambs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, of wormes, or meaner ſenſible paſſives. For none of them doth dye a violent death without ſtriving or reluctance, without endeavour to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy ſuch as afflict or torment them: Whereas this Lamb of God, to ſhew himſelfe to be the mirrour of patience and obedience, did pray for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, after the pangs of death more then natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, had ſeized upon him; after he had been buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetted, ſpit upon, ſcourged, and every way moſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7892:9"/>
diſgracefully abuſed; whilſt hee endured the lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring and cruell torments of the Croſſe, exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with bitter ſcoffes and revilings of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relenting perſecutors, (unceſſantly pouring vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar in ſtead of oyle into his wounds,) gave not the leaſt ſignification of diſcontent, either by word or geſture towards God or man; unleſſe ſome hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will put a ſiniſter interpretation upon that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation when he was ready to dye, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> But of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this exclamation, by Gods aſſiſtance, in its due time and place. In the interim without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to any mans perſon or authority, I reſt perſwaded that this ſpeech beareth no character of diſcontent, much leſſe of deſpaire. To conclude this point, As there never was any ſorrow like to his ſorrow in his ſufferings, ſo was there no obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor ever ſhall be any obedience, like to his from the beginning to the end of his ſufferings. This did farther exceed all his ſorrows, than his ſorrowes did the paines and ſorrowes of other men.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Nto this admirable lowlineſſe of obedience, God awarded a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent degree of exaltation. For ſo the Apoſtle inferreth in the words immediately following, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.9. &amp;c. <hi>Wherefore</hi> (or for this cauſe) <hi>God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name; that at the name of</hi> JESUS <hi>every knee ſhould bow, of things in Heaven, and things in earth, and things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the earth: and that every tongue ſhould confeſſe that</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>is Lord, to the glory of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> The ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. tells us, <hi>To this end Christ both dyed, roſe and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</hi> As man he was made Lord from his reſurrection, but as the Sonne of God, and a diſtinct perſon from his Father, he was Lord from eternity: as to omit other places before cited, our Apoſtles inference in the 14. of the <hi>Romanes, ver.</hi> 10.11. will make cleare to any Chriſtian that can take it into due conſideration, <hi>We ſhall all ſtand before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt.</hi> How is this proved, or whence had our Apoſtle himſelf this revelation? From the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> Chap. 45. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. For there it is written, <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord, every knee ſhall bow to me, and every
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7892:10"/>
tongue ſhall confeſſe unto God.</hi> Chriſt then not as man, but as God, was that Lord in whoſe name the Prophet ſpeaketh this, <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry knee ſhall bow to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Had this Lord the onely Sonne of God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken our nature upon him, though adorned even from the firſt moment of its aſſumption with ſuch majeſtie and glory, as now it is; yet the aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it would have beene an humiliation of the Sonne of God, not phyſicall, but rather (as I ſaid) civill, or <hi>ad modum civilis humiliationis,</hi> an incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and unparalleld affabilitie, an incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible loving kindneſſe. But for this Lord to be incarnate for us of a Virgin, to take our nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him charged with mortality and infirmities, to ſurcharge our ordinary humane conditions with the extraordinary eſtate of a ſervant; to burden this hard ſervitude with paine and torture, with diſgrace and ignominies, more than ſervitude hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane is capable of; This was that unexpreſſible humiliation and incomprehenſible loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe towards us miſerable men, which our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſo emphatically ſetteth forth for our patterne in ſubmitting our wills to his moſt holy will, as he did his unto his Fathers. And our Lord himſelf requireth that we ſhould be humble, as he is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: not according to the meaſure of his humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for that is as impoſſible for us, as to be as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as our heavenly Father is perfect, or as holy, as he is holy; Yet muſt we be truely holy, as our heavenly Father is holy, and ſincerely humble as the Sonne of God our Lord and Saviour was hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7892:10"/>
Our humiliation or obedience to his will, though it muſt be true, not hypocriticall; yet in this life at the beſt, and in the beſt of men is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect in compariſon of the obedience of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Angels, though theirs be but finite. But the depth of the humiliation of the Sonne of God is, as he is, immenſurable, truely infinite. Higher than God he could not be, but ſo high he was in glory and dignity from eternity: yet lower than man, than the moſt abject of the Sons of men, he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed for a time to be, that we might be at leaſt made equall to the Angels; even Lords and Kings unto God, of ſlaves by birth and condition unto infernall Tyrans.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But could hee not have thus advanced us without any depreſſion or humiliation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? could not we ſonnes of men be made happy without the miſery and ſorow of the Son of God? The anſwer to this <hi>Quaere</hi> will finde place hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. That which for the preſent deſerveth our conſideration, is that in all the ſeverall degrees of his humiliation, God the Father was ſtill pleaſed to exhibit ſome viſible documents, or ſenſible ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations of that glory and dignity, whereof his Sonne for a time had deveſted himſelfe, and of that glory unto which as man for his faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice done in our nature he was to be exalted. His birth, we know, was meane in the eyes of men, his entertainement at his firſt comming into the world, (for lodging eſpecially,) more deſpicable than the lodging or entertainement of poeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary Pilgrimes. Yet then welcomed into the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7892:11"/>
world by an hoaſt of Angels ſounding out gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory Hymnes unto God for the comfort of us miſerable men, for whoſe ſakes he who was their ſupreme Lord, did vouchſafe to deſcend thus low; and while they congratulate us, they doe truely adore him. But ſeeing the ditties of their congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulatory hymnes were heard onely by ſome few, and thoſe men of meaner rank in Jury; God would have his glory proclaymed by thoſe wiſe and po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tent men, which had ſeene his ſtar in the Eaſt, and from the glorious appearance or ſecret ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made to them of it, came in perſon, firſt to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> then to <hi>Bethleem,</hi> to tender that homage and ſervice to this Infant, which they ſcorned to performe to <hi>Herod,</hi> or <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> of whoſe greatneſſe no doubt they had heard, but did not admire or eſteeme it in compariſon of this late borne King of the Jews. Theſe and other glimpſes of that glory which was due unto him perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as man, though publiquely manifeſted, did not ſo much affect the ſtubborne hearted Jews, as the meanneſs of his ordinary condition or ſtate of life did offend them. No queſtion but that voice which came from heaven at his Baptiſme, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> was heard by more than by <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and both teſtifyed and proclaimed by him to them that heard it not; and yet forgotten by moſt within three yeares ſpace: ſo deepely forgotten, that they did not call to memory, at leaſt not lay it to heart, upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond publication of his glory. For ſome few daies before his ſufferings, the like encomiaſme of that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7892:11"/>
glory which was due unto him as he was the Son of God, was proclaimed from heaven, upon his prayers to this purpoſe, when his ſoule was heavy and troubled with expectation of approaching ſorrows, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12 26. &amp;c. <hi>If any man ſerve me, let him follow me, and where I am, there ſhall alſo my ſervant be.

Then came there a voice from heaven, ſaying, I have both glorifyed it, and will glorify it againe.</hi> This document of his glory was more publique than the former, and the end and ſcope of it more ſolemnly avou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by himſelf, <hi>ver.</hi> 29.30. <hi>The people therefore that ſtood by and heard it, ſaid, that it thundred: Others ſaid, an Angel ſpake to him.</hi> JESUS <hi>anſwered, and ſaid, This voice came not becauſe of me, but for your ſakes.</hi>

Luke</hi> 24.25, 26. Now all the ſufferings, and other Eclipſes of this Sunne of righteouſneſſe, were as clearely foretold as his future glory; both by expreſſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony and typicall matter of fact. By expreſſe teſtimony, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53.1, 2, 3. <hi>Who hath beleeved our report, and to whom is the arme of the Lord revealed? For he ſhall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a roote out of a dry ground: He hath no forme nor comelineſſe, and when we ſhal ſee him, there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him. He is deſpiſed, and rejected, a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with griefe: and we hid as it were, our faces from him. He was deſpiſed, and wee eſteemed him not.</hi>

Upon this ground this good Writer takes liberty to diſſent from the beſt Commentators that had gone before him, and peremptorily denyeth this place to be meant of the Son of Gods firſt comming into the world. And it cannot be denyed, but that this 97. Pſalme containes a remarkable Prophecy, that the Sonne of God, or God of Iſrael ſhould be made Lord and King, and Judge of the world by peculiar right. This is one of thoſe many places which (as in the former booke hath beene obſerved) cannot be meant of any, ſave onely of him who was truely God, and yet could not be punctually fulfilled, ſave onely of God incarnate. But <hi>Ribera</hi> ſhould have conſidered that one and the ſame paſſage in any Pſalme or Prophecy might have beene fulfilled in God incarnate at ſeverall times, and alike literally refer to ſeverall manifeſtations whether of his glory or of his ſufferings.

as that of the 8.

It is then no concludent proofe, which <hi>Ribera</hi> brings in prejudice of the Ancient to ſtrengthen his owne opinion, that the teſtimony alleaged by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.6. out of <hi>Pſalme</hi> 97. cannot be literally meant of our Lord and Saviours Nativitie; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the chief ſcope of that place, is to foretell his comming to judge the world, when he ſhall be attended with an hoaſt of Angels. For if this atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and obſequie be performed unto him, as is probable, by the whole hoaſt of Heaven; the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of his Nativitie, or firſt comming into the world by a band or company of theſe heavenly ſoldiers (how many, or how few, God onely knows) might be and certainly was a pledge or <hi>praeludium.</hi> Nor doth the placing of the words in the originall neceſſarily argue but that the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <head>CHAP. III. Whether our ſinnes could have beene remitted without the humiliation of the Sonne of God, is a point not determinable by men: That the manner of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting our ſinnes by his humiliation, was the moſt admirable way, which Wiſdome, Iuſtice, or Mercy could require.</head>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Eremptorily</hi> to avouch that God could not have remitted the ſinnes of our firſt Parents without full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, nor advanced their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeede unto glory without the diſgracefull ſufferings of his onely Sonne, would by ſome, and well might bee cenſured for a ſaucy doctrine: A
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7892:14"/>
doctrine, more derogatory from the Omnipotent Majeſty, than it would be to prerogatives Royall, to deny Kings or free Princes inveſted with it, the exerciſe of that moſt princely vertue, <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,</hi> or to grant a prohibition againſt them in caſe they ſhould freely forgive offences commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt themſelves, or afterwards honour the parties thus freely forgiven upon their extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary thankfulneſſe for ſuch gracious favours. This benignity no loyall Subject will grudge or repine at, when it is practiſed by his liege Lord and Soveraigne; and ſhall we deny the like free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to infinite Majeſtie, whereof benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and graciouſneſſe infinite, is (to ſpeake af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of men) a ſpeciall branch or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Yet on the other ſide reſolutely to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that the ſinnes of our firſt Parents could have been remitted without ſatisfaction, or their ſeed advanced to glory without the humiliation of the Sonne of God; would be a raſh, if not an unſound reſolution. For albeit wee take it for granted, that earthly Princes of the beſt temper may freely pardon any offences againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and crowne this ſpeciall favour with the advancement of the perſons ſo offending, to higher place and greater honour than formerly they did enjoy: yet will it not hence follow, that the Omnipotent and moſt juſt Judge might have done the like. For, he is not of Majeſty or of gracious goodneſſe onely, but of juſtice truely infinite; the immutable and indiſpenſible rule of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7892:14"/>
juſtice and goodneſſe. And he alone who is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome truely infinite, can determine whether the remiſſion of mens ſinnes without ſatisfaction, or the award of glory without ſome interpoſition of merits, doe not imply ſome contradiction to the rule of juſtice infinite, which they doe not imply to infinite Majeſty or benignity. The greateſt Majeſty on earth may more juſtly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don offences done againſt themſelves, than they can doe the like offences againſt the publique Law it ſelfe, or the community of men under their government. For earthly Princes how great or good ſoever they be, are no living lawes of goodneſſe, no living rules of juſtice. This is the praerogative of the Almighty Lord to be both a moſt righteous Judge, and the very Law or Idae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all rule of righteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Not Princes onely, but every private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or publique Magiſtrate (ſo they ſit not in the ſeat of Juſtice) may pardon a crime for its nature capitall, if it be onely committed againſt themſelves; as if a ſervant ſhould take his maſters purſe, not by violence, but unwarily laid aſide, and deny the finding, taking, or reſtoring of it; the maſter may without wounding his conſcience diſmiſſe the party delinquent of his ſervice, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out calling his life in queſtion, although the crime bee by humane law capitall. Nor ſhould the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, I take it, by this clemency incurre the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the humane Law, if he be as well content to loſe the money, as the delinquents ſervice. In this caſe hee may doe to the worſt of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7892:15"/>
as hee deſires it may be done to him, if his caſe or condition were the ſame. But if of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate maſter, he ſhould become a publike Judge, and ſhew the ſame favour to him that had been his ſervant, being arraigned for the like offence committed againſt another; hee ſhould hereby grievouſly tranſgreſſe both the Law of God and man. The true reaſon whereof is not becauſe the former rule [<hi>Of doing as hee would bee done unto</hi>] doth hold, as one of late (out of the ſpirit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction rather than judgement) hath taught; not univerſally or alwayes, but <hi>ad plurimum,</hi> for the moſt part, or now and then, or more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in private men than publike Magiſtrates. For they eſpecially are moſt ſtrictly tied to that fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall rule of juſtice and equity of <hi>doing as they would bee done unto.</hi> But ſeeing, as the great <hi>Caſuiſt Gerſon</hi> ſomewhere obſerves, Every Judge ſuſtaines a double perſon; one of his owne, as he is ſubject to the like infirmities with other men; another of the Publike Weale, or Community wherein hee liveth. Hence it is, or ſhould bee, that how mercifull or gracious ſoever he be by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall diſpoſition, or grace; yet when he aſcends the ſeat of Juſtice, hee muſt lay aſide his private perſon, all private conſiderations, and arme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the publike. Now the object of the obſervance of the former rule, of doing as hee would bee done unto, is not the perſon or party accuſed or arraigned, but the perſons whom hee wronged, or may hereafter wrong. The greateſt Judge in this caſe muſt do to the Commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Weale,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7892:15"/>
whereof he himſelfe is a member, as he deſires is ſhould be done to himſelfe in like caſe, that is, to right them when they are wronged, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them from further danger, by putting whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome lawes in execution, for cutting off noiſome members of publike Society.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But what of all this? God is no member of any Community, being in himſelfe farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and better than the whole Univerſe of things viſible and inviſible; and for this reaſon not bound to conforme himſelfe to any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer rules; which greateſt Princes are by his Law bound to obſerve. However, hee is immutable goodneſſe it ſelfe, more than the rule of all thoſe rules of mercy, juſtice, and goodneſſe which hee enjoines us to follow. It is moſt true, he can doe whatſoever he will, yet cannot any thing be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by him that is contrary to goodneſſe, juſtice, or mercy. Though his mercies exceed the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the beſt of men; yet ſome ſinnes there are which exempt men from participation of his mercies, ſinnes unpardonable to mercy it ſelfe: So ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Mar.</hi> 3.28, 29. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, all ſinnes ſhall be forgiven unto the ſonnes of men, and blaſphemies, wherewith ſoever they ſhall blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme. But hee that ſhall blaſpheme againſt the holy Ghoſt, hath never forgiveneſſe, but is in danger of eternall damnation.</hi> And S. <hi>Matthew</hi> more fully, Chap. 12. ver.31. <hi>Wherefore I ſay unto you, All manner of ſinne and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the blaſphemy againſt the holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven unto men. And whoſoever ſpeaketh
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7892:16"/>
a word againſt the Sonne of man, it ſhall bee forgiven him: but whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not bee forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</hi> It is not the ſole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie of that Majeſtie againſt which wee ſinne, that makes the ſinne ſo unpardonable. For the Father is of infinite Majeſty, the Sonne is of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Majeſty, and the holy Ghoſt can bee no more: their Majeſty and glory is coeternall, and coequall. The ſinne here meant then cannot bee any ſpeciall ſinne more offenſive againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the holy Ghoſt, then againſt the perſon of the Father, or the Sonne. Nor is it (whatſoever elſe it be) any one ſinne ſpecifically diſtinct from other ſinnes, as murther is from luſt, or luſt from pride and envie, but rather a confluence of many grievous ſinnes: It alwayes preſuppoſeth a great meaſure of long continued contempt of Gods ſpeciall favour, gifts, or goodneſſe. Thoſe whom our Saviour in the forecited places forewarnes, as being at the pit brink of this infernall bottomleſſe ſinne, were as S. <hi>Marke</hi> tells us, <hi>Scribes</hi> that <hi>came downe from Ieruſalem, Mark.</hi> 3.22. and as S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> addes, <hi>Phariſees</hi> too, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.24. Both of them had ſeene or heard our Saviours miracles which were ſo pregnant that they could not deny the truth of them. The particular miracle which occaſioned this diſcourſe, was the healing of one poſſeſſed of a Devill, <hi>inſomuch that being blind and dumbe before, he both ſpake and ſaw; and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were amazed, and ſaid, Is this the ſonne of David? And when the Phariſees heard it,</hi> (or as S. <hi>Marke</hi>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:7892:16"/>
addes, the Scribes which came downe from Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem) <hi>they ſaid, this fellow doth not caſt out Devils, but by Beelzebub, the Prince of Devils, Matt.</hi> 12.22. <hi>Mark.</hi> 3.24. And S. <hi>Marke</hi> giving the reaſon why our Saviour, after hee had called the Scribes and Phariſees to him, and debated this controverſie with them, did forewarne them in ſpeciall of this dangerous ſinne, addeth, <hi>Becauſe they ſaid, he hath an uncleane ſpirit, Mark.</hi> 3.30.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Into this fearefull ſinne, or rather high meaſure of ſinne, of whoſe danger our Saviour ſo graciouſly forewarnes theſe Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees; thoſe convert Hebrews to whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote that excellent Epiſtle, were ready without his like admonitions to fall. <hi>It is impoſsible</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for thoſe men who were once enlightned, and have taſted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the holy Ghoſt, and have taſted the good word of God, and the power of the world to come: If they ſhall fall away, to renew them againe unto repentance: ſeeing they crucifie unto themſelves the Sonne of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame. For the earth, which drinketh in the raine that commeth oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbes meet for them by whom it is dreſſed, receiveth bleſsing from God. But that which bringeth forth thornes and briers, is rejected, and is nigh unto curſing, whoſe end is to bee burned, Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others perhaps in thoſe times had either incurred this ſentence here denounced, or ſtood in greater danger than theſe Hebrews did, of whom our Apoſtle at this time had good hope; <hi>But beloved, wee are perſwaded better things of you,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7892:17"/>
and things that accompany ſalvation, though we thus ſpeake. For God is not unrighteous to forget your worke and labour of love, which yee have ſhewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Name, in that ye have miniſtred towards his Saints, and doe miniſter, Heb.</hi> 6.9.10. Of our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles punctuall meaning, or ſenſe in theſe two ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes laſt cited, as of all the reſt unto the end of the Chapter, I ſhall have occaſion hereafter to treat. Of the former verſes, I have no more for this preſent, or hereafter (for ought I know) to ſay, then this; That their meaning, if any be diſpoſed to ſcan them more exactly, may (I take it) bee beſt illuſtrated by the type or parallel exhibited in the dayes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in thoſe men which were excluded by oath from the land of Canaan, <hi>Num.</hi> 14.20, 21, 22, 23. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, I have pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned according to thy word. But as truely as I live, all the earth ſhall bee filled with the glory of the Lord. Becauſe all thoſe men, which have ſeene my glory and my miracles which I did in Egypt, and in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and have tempted mee now theſe ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; Surely they ſhall not ſee the land which I ſware unto their fathers, neither ſhall any of them that provoked me, ſee it.</hi> All theſe, which were all the Males of Iſrael above twenty yeares of age, ſave <hi>Caleb, Ioſhua,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> (who was in part involved in this ſentence) did beare a true type, or ſhadow of thoſe who offending in like manner againſt Chriſt and his Goſpel, we call Reprobates, yet not ſo true types of ſuch a ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, as thoſe which went to ſearch the land of Canaan. <hi>And the men which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7892:17"/>
Moſes ſent to ſearch the land, who returned and made all the Congregation to murmure againſt him, by brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging up a ſlander upon she land. Even thoſe men that did bring up the evill report upon the land</hi> (after they had ſeene the goodlineſſe, and taſted the pleaſant fruits of it) <hi>died of the plague before the Lord. But</hi> Joſhua <hi>the ſonne of</hi> Nun, <hi>and</hi> Caleb <hi>the ſonne of</hi> Jephunneh, <hi>which were of the men that went to ſearch the land, lived ſtill:</hi> and many happy dayes after that time, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.36, 37, 38.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Very probable it is, though I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con,</hi> that the irremiſſible ſinne whereof our Saviour and S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeake, for which there remaineth no ſatisfaction, was if dot pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, yet <hi>Epidemicall</hi> unto thoſe primitive times, wherein the kingdom of heaven was firſt planted here on earth by our Saviour: and the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church was in erection by the miniſtery of the Apoſtles, or in times wherein the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gifts of the holy Spirit were moſt plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and moſt conſpicuous. Even in thoſe times, into this wofull eſtate none could fall, <hi>which had not taſted of the heavenly gift, of the good word of God, and of the powers of the world to come, and had not beene partakers of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Nor did ſuch men fall away by ordinary ſinnes, but by relaps into Iewiſh blaſphemy, or heatheniſh Idolatry, and malicious ſlander of the kingdom of heaven, of whoſe power they had taſted. God was good to all his creatures in their creation, and better to men in their redemption by Chriſt: of this later goodneſſe all men werein ſome degree partakers.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7892:18"/>
The contempt, or neglect of this goodneſſe was not irremiſſible: the parties thus farre offending, and no further, were not excluded from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Chriſts ſatisfaction, or from renewing by repentance: but of the gifts of the Spirit which was plentifully poured out after our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours aſcenſion, all were not partakers. This was a ſpeciall favour, or peculiar goodneſſe, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued contempt, or ſolemne abrenuntiation by relapſe either into heatheniſme, or Jewiſh blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy was unpardonable; not in that it was a ſinne peculiarly committed againſt the perſon of the holy Ghoſt, but becauſe it did include an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary oppoſition unto the indiſpenſable law of juſtice, or goodneſſe, which God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, are.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Some ſinnes then there be, or ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of them, which being made up, no ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction will be accepted for them. It is impoſſible according to the ſacred phraſe, that the parties thus delinquent ſhould bee renewed by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But whether according to this dialect of the holy Ghoſt, that grand ſinne, whereof our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and the Apoſtle ſpeakes be abſolutely irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſible untill death hath determined their impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency which committed it; or onely exceeding dangerous in compariſon of other ſinnes, I will not here diſpute: much leſſe dare I take upon me to determine either branch of the maine que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion propoſed: As [<hi>whether ſatisfaction were abſolutely neceſſary for remitting the ſinnes of our firſt Parents, or their ſeed?</hi>] Or, [<hi>whether the Son
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7892:18"/>
of God could have brought us ſinners unto glory by any other way, or meanes than that which is revealed unto us in his Goſpel?</hi>] It ſhall ſuffice me (and ſo I requeſt the Reader it may doe him) to ſhew that this revealed way is the moſt admirable for the ſweet concurrence of Wiſdome, Juſtice, Mercy, and whatſoever other branches of goodneſſe elſe bee, which the heart of man can conceive; more admirable by much than wiſdome finite could have contrived, or our miſerable condition deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, unleſſe it had been revealed unto us by God himſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. For demonſtration of this concluſion, and for deterring all which pretend unto the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or dignity of being the Sonnes of God, from continuance in ſinne, no principle of faith, or paſſage in the ſacred Canon can bee of better uſe then that 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.8. <hi>He that committeth ſinne is of the Devill: for the Devill ſinneth from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.

Our later Engliſh which I alledged readeth [that he might deſtroy] the former, that hee might diſſolve the works of the Devill.

Some works of the Devill, the Sonne of God is ſaid

more properly to diſſolve, others more properly to deſtroy. Sinne it ſelfe, as the Apoſtle tells us, is the proper worke of the Devill, his perpetuall worke; for he ſinneth from the beginning. And for this cauſe the man that committeth ſinne is of the Devill, the Devills workman, or day labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, ſo long as hee continues in knowne ſinnes.

                  <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He word <hi>Beginning,</hi> is ſome times taken univerſally and abſolutely, as it reacheth to the firſt moment of time, or to the firſt beginning of heaven and earth, of all things viſible and inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which have beginning of being. <note n="*" place="margin">See the 7 book cap. 26. § 34.</note> From this utmoſt extent of the word <hi>beginning,</hi> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the beginning or entrance into his Goſpel ſtrongly inferrs, that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Word by whom all things were made, was truely God, without beginning or end of dayes, becauſe he was in the <hi>beginning,</hi> that is, had a true and reall exiſtence, when all things whether viſible or inviſible, which were created by him, did but begin to be. But the beginning mentioned by the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the forecited place, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.8. may not be ſtretched ſo farre as to make it pitch upon the firſt beginning of time, or of all things made or created. Firſt, it is neither certaine nor probable that any of the Angelicall ſubſtances were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or begun to bee before all other creatures. Secondly, it cannot be certainely knowne whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the bleſſed Angels which keepe their ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the collapſed Angels, were all created in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7892:20"/>
the ſame inſtant: or if it were certaine or gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that ſome of them were created before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, though all of the ſame day; yet could there be no certainty or probability that the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed Angel which is become a Devill (or prince of Devils, who S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, ſinned from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning) was created before all other Angels, or with the firſt that were created. Moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is (in my opinion) that the Angels were all created in the fourth evening and morning, together with the Sunne and Moone, and the Starres of the Firmament, two dayes before man was created. Thus much thoſe words of God unto <hi>Iob, (Chap.</hi> 38. <hi>ver.</hi> 4.) ſeeme to import. <hi>Where waſt thou when I laid the foundations of the world, &amp;c. or when the morning ſtarres ſang together, and all the ſonnes of God ſhouted for joy?</hi> If by the ſonnes of God in this place the Angels be meant, then Lucifer, by which name we commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Devill, was then the ſonne of God, an Angel of light, and did with the whole hoaſt of heaven praiſe, laud, and magnifie his Creatour: whenſoever hee was created, God created him righteous and juſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now albeit he was the firſt of all Gods vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible creatures that became evill: though ſinne it ſelfe did take its beginning from him, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly he had a perfect being before ſinne did begin to be in him: hee did not, he could not ſin in the ſame point of duration in which hee was created. Some therefore for this reaſon referre the <hi>beginning</hi> mentioned in S. <hi>Iohn</hi> to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7892:20"/>
of ſinne, as if his meaning in their conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction were thus: Satan ſinneth perpetually from the beginning of ſinne, which had its firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in him. But though this be true, yet if wee ſtretch the <hi>beginning</hi> of our Apoſtle thus farre, it will not <hi>cloſe</hi> ſo well with his collection or infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences: For the Devill in the ſame place is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiled, a <hi>ſinner</hi> from the beginning eſpecially, if not onely, with reference to thoſe works which the Sonne of God was to diſſolve or deſtroy. But the Sonne of God did not manifeſt himſelfe on purpoſe to diſſolve the works which the Devill had wrought in himſelfe, or in the collapſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels his aſſociats; but the works onely which they had wrought in man. For this cauſe ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>He tooke not on him the nature of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but hee tooke on him the ſeed of Abraham, Heb.</hi> 2.16. As the Devill is a liar, and father of lies ſince the beginning, ſo he was a ſinner not onely in himſelfe, but the beginner or begetter of ſinne in man. And ſince he firſt begot ſinne in him, he ſinneth ſtill as a worker, or foſter-father of ſinnes in mans poſterity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whether our firſt Parents did ſinne upon the ſame day whereon they were created, is to me uncertaine: and for this reaſon I will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute either upon the improbabilities or probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the affirmative opinion which is maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by many, of whoſe opinion I had rather make ſome good uſe, than move any controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie about it. Moſt certaine it is, that the old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and his aſſociats were ſinners themſelves,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7892:21"/>
before they ſeduced our firſt Parents to that firſt and hainous ſinne of mankind. Whether one or more of them had poſſeſſed the viſible <hi>Serpent,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith was <hi>ſubtiler then all the beaſts of the field,</hi> (as the fitteſt inſtrument or organ) for accompliſhing their deſigne againſt poore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent man; his ruine was projected before hee or they could accompliſh it. Moſt probable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine it is that they had grievouſly ſinned againſt their God and Creator, if not before, yet at leaſt from the Creation, or firſt beginning of man, whoſe eſtate they envied: yet whether they were irreverſibly caſt out of Gods gratious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence before the accompliſhment of this their project againſt man, is not ſo certaine. More pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to me it is, that the accompliſhment of this wicked project, which they could not hope to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect but by ſlandering their Creator, did make up the meaſure of their former ſinnes unto an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable height; unto an height more unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable then the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt is in men during this life. For wee reade not of any curſe or wofull Sentence pronounced, much leſſe peremptorily denounced againſt the old Serpent and his aſſociats, untill God had convented this viſible Serpent, and the woman whom he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled. But the curſe denounced againſt that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Serpent did fall upon the whole Legion of uncleane ſpirits, which had poſſeſſed it, or uſed it as their inſtrument, though perhaps poſſeſſed but by one.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In this ſeduction of our firſt Parents (if
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7892:21"/>
not before) the Devill committed ſinne, no leſſe then rebellion or high treaſon againſt his maker. In this alone, if not otherwiſe, he proudly ſought to be like God, in that he made man of a ſervant or ſonne of God, to become his ſlave, or vaſſall. He was of <hi>Iulius Caeſars</hi> minde, or rather <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> of his; and more affected ro be Lord <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount</hi> over earth and the viſible creatures in it, then inferiour, or <hi>Compeere</hi> to any Celeſtiall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And no marvell or matter of wonderment it is, if this combination of rebellion againſt God, and of envie againſt man, by God appointed the ſupreme Lord of all viſible creatures, did make the breach, of Satans allegiance to his Creator ſo irreconcileable, that the true and onely Sonne of God would not vouchſafe to become his Lord Redeemer, as hee is of men, whom hee ſeduced. But whether S. <hi>Iohns</hi> meaning in the forecited place be, that the Devill ſinneth from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſinne in man, or from the beginning of ſinne in himſelfe: From the one, or from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beginning, hee ſtill continueth to ſin againſt God and man without end or intermiſſion.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But is ſinne in man in deed and truth the work of Satan? If truely and properly it bee a work, it is ſomething or more then ſomething, as being the work of him who doth not buſie himſelfe about ſmall matters. It muſt be a thing either viſible or inviſible, and if it bee compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under either part of this diviſion, why are wee taught to beleeve that God the Father Almighty is the Maker not onely of heaven and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7892:22"/>
earth, but of all things viſible and inviſible in them? If all things were made by him, what could be left for Satan to work or make? The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance of this difficulty moved that acute and learned Father S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſometime to ſay, that ſinne was nothing, and oftentimes to allot it a cauſe deficient onely, denying it any true poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive efficient. And many good Writers ſince his time, in our dayes eſpecially, overſwaid with this Fathers bare authority, will have ſinnes of what kinde ſoever, to be privations onely, no poſitive entities. But they conſider not that the ſelfe ſame difficulties, beſides other greater more inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inconveniences, will preſſe them no leſſe, who make ſinne to bee a meere privation, or to have a cauſe deficient onely; than they doe others who acknowledge it to have a poſitive efficient cauſe, and a being more then meerly privation.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. What then bee the ſpeciall inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, wherewith their opinions are charged which make ſinne either nothing, or but a meere privation? Firſt wee account it a folly in man, a folly incident to no man, but an <hi>Heautontimory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon</hi> to bee angry or chaſing hot for nothing. Hence ſeeing the Almighty Judge doth never pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh either man or Devill, but for ſinne; we ſhall caſt a foule aſperſion on his wiſdome and Juſtice, by maintaining ſinne to bee nothing. But fewer in our times there be, (though ſome I have heard out of the Pulpit, which under pretence of St. <hi>Auguſtins</hi> authority) make ſinne to bee meere nothing. But many there bee who hold it to be a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7892:22"/>
meere privation, which is a meane betweene meere nothing, and a poſitive entitie. Yet admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, (not granting) the nature of ſinne to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt formally in privation: meere privations for the moſt part have cauſes truely efficient, fewer, cauſes merely deficient, if there can bee any cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality in deficiencie. <hi>Blindneſſe, deafeneſſe, dumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> are privations; and yet more men loſe the ſenſe of <hi>hearing, ſight,</hi> or <hi>feeling,</hi> (in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular members) by violent blowes, or by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of raging humours, than by meere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or decaying of ſpirits. And where one man drops into his grave for meere age (as ripe apples doe from the trees they grow on to the ground without blaſts of winde or ſhaking) a thouſand die a violent, or untimely death by true and poſitive efficient cauſes, either externall, or internall.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That which either hath deceived, or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldned many Divines to allot ſinne a being one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly privative, is a Philoſophicall or metaphyſicall <hi>Maxime</hi> moſt true in it ſelfe, or in its proper ſphere, but moſt impertinently applied to the point now in queſtion. The <hi>Maxime</hi> is, <hi>Omne ens, quà ens, eſt bonum:</hi> Every entity in that it hath a being, is good. Moſt true, if wee ſpeake of tranſcendentall goodneſſe, or <hi>bonum entis:</hi> for every thing which hath a true being, is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a goodneſſe entitative. But the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt Divines is, or ſhould be about moral goodneſſe, or that goodneſſe which is oppoſed to [<hi>malum culpae</hi>] that evill which wee call ſinne.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7892:23"/>
Now if every poſitive entitie, or nature were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily good, according to this notion of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: every intelligent rationall creature ſhould be as impeccable as his Creator, and wee ſhould truely ſinne, (if to ſpeake untruly bee a ſinne) when wee ſay the Devill is a knave, or any man diſhoneſt. For if every nature, or entity (as ſuch) were morally good, it were impoſſible any nature or poſitive entity ſhould bee evill qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhould be laden with ſinne, that is, with that evill which is oppoſed to goodneſſe moral, or to holineſſe; whether this evill be a meere privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or poſitive entitie. For in as much as the ſight, or viſive facultie is the property of the eye, or in as much as this propoſition is true: <hi>Oculus, quà oculus videt</hi>; this concluſion is moſt neceſſary, [when the eye hath loſt the ſight, or viſive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, it is no more an eye, unleſſe in ſuch an equivocall ſenſe, as wee ſay a picture hath eyes, though not ſo properly.] If a man cannot ſee (as we ſay) <hi>ſtime,</hi> but with one eye, we account it no ſoleciſme to ſay hee hath loſt the other. The caſe in the former inſtances is more cleare: If Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan or man were morally good becauſe they have a poſitive entity or nature; neither of them could poſſibly be morally evill, neither of them ſinfull creatures, albeit wee ſhould grant ſinne to bee as meere a privation, as blindneſſe is.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It is a <hi>maxime</hi> in true Logick (that is, in the faculty or ſcience of reaſoning abſolutely true) and therefore true in Divinity alſo (for truth is but one, and it is her property not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7892:23"/>
her ſelfe, though examined in ſeverall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;) <hi>Quicquid convenit ſubjecto quà tale, non poteſt abeſſe ſine ſubjecti interitu.</hi> No naturall property can ceaſe to bee, or periſh, but together with the ſubject which ſupports it. Whence if that Angel which is now the Devill had been truely good, <hi>quà Angelus,</hi> or if goodneſſe (moral) had belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged unto him, as he was a poſitive entitie, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall creature, hee had ceaſed to be either a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall creature, or any thing elſe, when hee loſt his goodneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Of ſinnes of omiſſion, it is moſt true, that they finde place in our nature, rather by defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency than efficiency; and yet even this deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie for the moſt part, is occaſioned by ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall poſitive act or habit. For this cauſe it is queſtioned among Schoolemen, Whether there is or can bee any ſinne of meere omiſſion, that is, not occaſioned by the commiſſion of ſome other ſinfull acts precedent, or linked with ſome ſuch act preſent. To deny all ſinnes of meere emiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in nature already corrupted, would bee more probable than in the firſt ſinne whether of man or Angel. Neither of them could poſſibly have committed ſinne, or done that which they ought not to have done, without ſome precedent omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that which they ought to have done. But of this elſwhere more at large; and ſomewhat of it briefly in the next Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Sure I am, that the work which Satan wrought in our firſt Parents and in our nature, had a cauſe truely efficient, hath a being more
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7892:24"/>
than meerely privative. For it was a work ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally great and ſo cunningly contrived, that the ſtrength and wiſdome of the Sonne of God was required (as being onely all-ſufficient) to diſſolve or deſtroy it; and is it poſſible that any ſo great a work could be wrought by deficiencie, or a defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive worker? Not Satan onely, but his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are as poſitive, as induſtrious efficients, as effectuall workers of iniquity, as the beſt man which ever lived (the man CHRIST JESUS onely excepted) was, or is of righteouſneſſe. But it is true againe, that neither Satan nor his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can produce or make any ſubſtances or ſubjects: theſe are all the works of God whether they be viſible, or inviſible. What ſhall wee ſay then, that God did create any naked ſubſtances, and leave it free for Angel or other his creatures to inveſt them with what accidents or qualities they pleaſed? No; if God had created any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances without accidents, they ſhould have been morally neither good, nor bad: For all other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures beſides the incomprehenſible Eſſence, who onely eſſentially <hi>is,</hi> and whoſe eſſence is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it ſelfe, though they were made actually good, yet their goodneſſe was mutable: it was but an accident or quality, no eſſentiall property. What ſhall we ſay then to the propoſed objection, that ſinne if it bee any thing, either viſible or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, muſt be of Gods making, not the work of Satan, ſeeing we acknowledge God to be the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of all things viſible and inviſible?</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The punctuall anſwer is, That this univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7892:24"/>
[<hi>God made all things viſible, and inviſible</hi>] muſt bee extended onely to thoſe things which are properly ſaid to bee made or created. Now ſubſtances onely whether viſible or inviſible, are the immediate and direct effects and proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of creation. Accidents had their beginning as appurtenances to their ſubjects, by reſultance onely. That goodneſſe which God approved in man, did reſult from his nature, not <hi>quà talis,</hi> but as it was the immediate work of God: it had no making or creation diſtinct from the creation of man. He that <hi>moulds</hi> a bullet, or makes a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall ſphere, maketh both <hi>round</hi>; and yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay that he makes <hi>rotundity</hi> or <hi>roundneſſe,</hi> by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny work or action diſtinct from the making of the bullet or ſphere. <hi>Factâ ſphaerâ ſimul ſit rotunditas:</hi> That which the Artificer intends, is a ſphere; yet cannot he poſſibly make a ſphere, but <hi>rotunditie</hi> will by reſultance ariſe with it, or from it. In like manner, when God made man, he made him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his owne Image and ſimilitude: this was the <hi>mould</hi> in which he was caſt; and being caſt into this <hi>mould,</hi> he could not but be good.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. The humane nature, as framed by God, was like a muſicall inſtrument exactly made and exactly tuned, both at once; not firſt made, and then tuned. That body of earth into which the Almighty Creator firſt inſpired the breath of life, was not firſt a man in <hi>puris naturalibus,</hi> and afterwards adorned or beautified with originall juſtice. That ſpirit of life, which God inſpired into him, did ſo tune and ſeaſon the whole maſſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7892:25"/>
or ſubſtance, that his reaſonable ſoule or ſpirit did forthwith hold exact harmony with the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators will. His inferiour faculties or affections, held exact conſort with his reaſon. All this was the work of God, and with this harmony was God delighted; yet this harmony, though moſt exact, was mutably exact. The goodneſſe or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of this ſweet harmony in the humane nature became the object of Satans envy, and the mutability of this excellencie became the ſubject of his temptations: a ſubject capable of intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto evill. The onely mark which Satan aimed at, was to deface or diſſolve this work of God, and in ſtead of this ſweet harmony to plant a perpetuall diſcord in the humane nature; a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, an enmity betwixt the ſoule and ſpirit of man and his God; a diſcord, an enmity, or civill warre betwixt mans conſcience and his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Satan then did deface, or diſſolve the work of God, and the Sonne of God was manifeſted to diſſolve his works in man, and to deſtroy his power.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ith</hi> the nature of ſinne in generall, or according to that extent propoſed in the beginning of the former book, I meddle not in theſe preſent <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries,</hi> but have reſerved them to another work already begun in a Dialect more capable of ſuch ſchoole nicities or diſquiſitions, than our Engliſh is. About the nature or ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call quality of the ſinne of <hi>Lucifer</hi> (ſo it hath pleaſed the Ancients to ſtile that prince of the collapſed Angels) ſome queſtion there is amongſt Divines, and the like about the quality or nature of our firſt Parents ſinne: as whether one or both of them were <hi>pride</hi> or <hi>infidelity.</hi> But <hi>infidelity</hi> in its proper uſe and ſignification, is rather a ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, or concomitant of many ſinnes precedent, than any one ſinne; a diſtruſt of Gods mercy for pardoning ſinnes committed. It is to my capacity unconceivable how the firſt ſinne of what crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſoever ſhould be <hi>infidelitie</hi>; or how the firſt degree of infidelity could find entrance into man or Angel, without ſome poſitive forerunning ſin. But if by infidelity thoſe Divines, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in this point I cannot approve, meane no more than incogitancie or want of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wee ſhall accord upon the matter. For
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7892:26"/>
without the omiſſion of ſomewhat which they ought to have done, neither man nor Angel could have ſinned ſo poſitively and groſly, as both of them did. Both were bound to have made the goodneſſe of their Creator in making them ſuch glorious creatures as they were, the choiſe and moſt conſtant object of their firſt thoughts and contemplations. But through want of ſtirring up that grace of God, which they received in their creation, or by not exerciſing their abilities to reflect upon the goodneſſe and greatneſſe of their Creator, they were ſurprized with a deſire of proper excellency, or of greater dignity than they were capable of. By this meanes that ſinne which was begun by incogitancy, or want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon the true object of their bliſſe, was accompliſhed in pride. For pride naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults in men from too much reflection upon their owne good parts. And whileſt they compare themſelves with themſelves, (as our Apoſtle ſpeaketh) they become unwiſe, or which is worſe, whileſt they compare their owne good parts with others meane parts (whether ſuch indeed, or to their apprehenſion) they ſlide without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery into that ſoule ſinne of hypocriſie. All men by nature, (that is from the <hi>unweeded</hi> relikes of our firſt Parents pride) are prone to overvalue themſelves, and to thirſt after greater dignities than they deſerve, or are qualified for. This pride or ambition in the Angels was preſently ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with envy (as ſoule a vice, as pride it ſelfe, and its uſuall compeere and companion) againſt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7892:26"/>
the new and laſt-made viſible creature man, and envy did as ſpeedily bring forth that malitious practice againſt our firſt Parents, which (as was ſaid before) in probability did make their ſinne more unpardonable than the ſinne of our firſt Parents was.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But admitting both their firſt poſitive ſins, to have been for nature or ſpecificall qualitie, <hi>deſire of proper excellencie,</hi> whoſe branches are pride and ambition: this poſition admitted, will beget a new queſtion or diſquiſition, to wit, What manner of proper excellency, or what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of pride it was, for which their juſt Creator did puniſh them? Some are of opinion, that the height of that proper excellency, at which the Angels (at leaſt one Angel) did aime, was perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall union with the Sonne of God or God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. But this opinion, without prejudice to the Authors or abettors of it, is very improbable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the myſtery that the Son of God ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a creature, or take any created ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce into the unity of his perſon, was not for ought I have read, or can gather from any paſſage in Scripture, revealed either explicitly or implicitly before the fall of man, or before his convention for his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy from God; which was not untill the firſt day of the ſecond weeke at ſooneſt, when the world was (as we ſay) in <hi>facto,</hi> not in <hi>fieri</hi> onely, as it reſpectively was in the firſt weeke, or ſeven dayes. When this opinion, that the aſſumption of any creature into unity of perſon with the Sonne of God, or with any perſon in the bleſſed

Trinity, was either knowen or probably concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by man or Angel before the fall of man, ſhall be ſufficiently proved, I ſhall yeeld aſſent to their opinion as probable, who think the firſt ſinne of Lucifer was a deſire or longing after perſonall union with the Sonne of God or God himſelfe. No queſtion but the old Serpent had ſinned more grievouſly in the ſame kind than our firſt Parents did, when the woman by his cunning and malice, and the man by her prevarication did taſte the forbidden fruit, in hope or expectation to bee made thereby like to <hi>Elohim,</hi> or God himſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But was it poſſible that either the collapſed Angels, or man by their ſuggeſtion, ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or deſire to bee equall with God, or to bee Gods Almighty? To bee in all points coequall with God, was perhaps more than Lucifer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did deſire: yet that even our firſt Parents deſired to bee in ſome ſort or other equall with God, is probable from the Apoſtles character of the Sonne of God [<hi>Hee being,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>in the forme of God, thought it no robbery to bee equall with God.</hi>] This to my underſtanding implies, that the robbery or ſacriledge committed by our firſt Parents for which the Sonne of God did humble and ingage himſelfe to make ſatisfaction, was their proud or haughty attempt to be equal with God, at leſt in knowledge of good and evill. And yet, as was ſaid before, the collapſed Angels had doubtleſſe ſinned more preſumptuouſly, before they tempted our firſt Parents to the like ſinne. Neither man nor Angel could have affected equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

in any one attribute with their Creator, much leſſe in all or moſt, ſo they had made his glory, power, or majeſty, the chiefe or principall object of their firſt contemplations.

Many things, many learned and wiſe men doe, and attempt more, through incogitancy, want of conſideration (or <hi>ad pauca reſpicientes</hi>) which by men of meaner parts would bee ſuſpected for a ſpice of madneſſe, if they had taken them into ſerious conſideration before.</p>

But of the originall of transforming the Divine nature into the ſimilitude of mans corrupted nature, I have <note n="*" place="margin">In the 5th. book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries upon the Apoſtles Creed, or a Treatiſe containing the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe, &amp;c. See the former Treatiſe, chap. 44.45. &amp;c.</note> elswhere long agoe delivered my minde at large. And I would to God ſome (as I conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture) offended with what I there obſerved (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reference or reſpect either to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or their ſtudies) had not verified the truth of my obſervations in a larger meaſure, than I then did conceived they could have been really ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, or exemplified by the meditation or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of any rationall man. This tranſformation of the Divine nature, which is in ſome ſort or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree common to moſt men, is (in the leaſt degree of it) one of thoſe works of the Devill, which the Sonne of God came into the world to diſſolve
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7892:29"/>
by doctrine, by example, and exerciſe of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. But what bee the reſt of thoſe works be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this? All (I take it) may be reduced to theſe generall heads. Firſt, <hi>the actuall ſinnes of our firſt Parents.</hi> Secondly, <hi>the remainder or effects of this ſinne whether in our firſt Parents, or in their poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to wit, that more than habituall, or hereditary cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption which we call, ſinne originall.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>ſins adventitious or acquired,</hi> that is, <hi>ſuch vitious acts, or habits, as doe not neceſſarily iſſue from that ſinne which deſcends unto us from our firſt Parents, but are voluntarily produced in particular men, by their abuſe of that portion of freewill which was left in our firſt Parents, and in their poſterity, and that was a true freedome of will, though not to doe well, or ill, yet at leſt</hi> inter mala: <hi>to doe leſſe, or greater evill, or to doe this or that particular, ill, or worſe.</hi> Originall ſinne is rather in us <hi>ad modum habitus,</hi> than an habit properly ſo called. All other habituall ſinnes or vices are not acquired but by many unneceſſitated vicious acts: But to diſtinguiſh betweene vice and ſinne, or betweene vicious habits and ſinfull habits, is (to my capacity) a work (or attempt rather) of the ſame nature, as if one ſhould goe about to divide a point into two portions; or a mathematicall line into two parallels.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Nor are theſe ſinnes enumerated, nor ſinne it ſelf <hi>formally</hi> taken the onely works of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill which the Sonne of God came to deſtroy, but theſe ſinnes with their ſymptomes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultances. For the Devill ſinneth from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in continuall tempting men to ſinne, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7892:30"/>
his temptations doe not alwayes take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. He ſinneth likewiſe in accuſing men before their Creator, or ſolliciting greater vengeance than their ſinnes in favourable conſtruction, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. Now that neither his temptations, nor accuſations do alwayes finde that ſucceſſe, which hee intends, this is meerely from the mercy and loving kindneſſe of our Creator in ſending his Sonne to diſſolve the works of Satan. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſymptome or reſultance of all ſinne origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, or actuall, is ſervitude or ſlavery unto Satan, and the wages of this ſervitude is death: not this hereditary ſervitude onely, but death which is the wages of it, is the work of Satan. Yet a work which the Sonne of God doth not utterly deſtroy untill the generall reſurrection of the dead. Nor ſhall it then bee deſtroyed in any, in whom the bonds of the ſervitude and ſlavery unto ſinne have not been by the ſame Sonne of God diſſolved, whileſt they lived on earth. Hee was firſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the fleſh and forme of a ſervant to pay the ranſome of our ſinnes, and to untie the bonds and fetters of ſinne in generall. Hee was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in his reſurrection to diſſolve or breake the raigne of ſinne within every one of us. For as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>He died for our ſinnes, and roſe againe for our juſtification.</hi> And he ſhall laſtly bee manifeſted, or appeare in glory utterly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy ſinne, and death.

deſigned <hi>to his exaltation after death,</hi> and <hi>his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration to his everlaſting Prieſthood.</hi> Wee are now to proſecute the points propoſed in the title of this Section, and in the firſt place ſuch points as were propoſed in the title of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The rule is univerſally true in works natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, civill, and ſupernaturall, but true with ſome ſpeciall allowances, <hi>Vnum quodque eodem modo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvitur, quo conſtituitur.</hi> Though the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſſolution of the ſame work include two contrary motions, yet the manner or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod by which both are wrought is uſually the ſame; onely the order is inverted. And wee ſhould the better know how mans firſt tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was diſſolved by Sonne of God, if wee firſt knew how it was wrought by Satan, or wherein the ſinne it ſelfe did properly conſiſt. Infidelity or diſobedience it could not bee, for theſe are ſymptomes of ſinnes already hatched. Whatſoever elſe it was, the firſt tranſgreſſion was <hi>pride,</hi> or ambitious deſire of independent immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. Now the Sonne of God begun his work where Satan ended his; diſſoluing this ſinne of pride, by his unſpeakable humility. And to take away the guilt of mans diſobedience or infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which were the ſymptomes or reſultances of his intemperate deſires; the Sonne of God did humble himſelfe to death, even to the death of the Croſſe, repoſing himſelfe in all his ſufferings upon God. The firſt man was the onely Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite which the King of kings had here on earth, the onely creature whom hee had placed as a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7892:31"/>
Prince in Paradiſe, a ſeat more than royall or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall, with hopes of advancement unto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelfe. It was a plot as malicious, as cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in Satan to diſpoſſeſſe man of his preſent dignity, and to throw him downe from this height of hope to helliſh ſlavery; to make him a creature more miſerable than the earth, water, or other inferiour element, harboured any. Yet was his miſery if wee found the very depth of it, not commenſurable to the exceſſive meaſure of his pride. The ground or bottome of his pride was lower than the loweſt part of the earth, as low as nothing: the height of it reached above the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt heavens. Man, who as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, was but <hi>terrae filius, &amp; nihili nepos,</hi> the ſonne of the earth, and nephew of nothing. Man, who if he had looked back to his late beginning, might have ſaid to the ſilly earth-worme, <hi>Thou art my ſiſter,</hi> and to every creeping thing, <hi>Thou art my brother</hi>; became ſo forgetfull of his originall, that hee ſought (by the ſuggeſtion of Satan) to become like his Almighty Creator, who out of the ſame earth had made him ſo much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than all earthly or ſublunary creatures, as they were than nothing. But let the firſt mans pride, or Satans malice in hatching it, and the reſt of that ſinfull brood, receive all the degrees of aggravation which the invention of man can put upon them: yet the medicine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by the Sonne of God, will appeare more ample, than the wound is wide; and more ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne than it is dangerous. Satans cunning in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7892:32"/>
working mans fall doth no way equalize the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Sonne of God in diſſolving this work. It is not probable, as was obſerved before, that Satan could ſo farre infatuate the firſt man as to make him affect to bee every way equall with his God, but onely to be like or equall unto him in ſome prerogative, as in the knowledge of good and evill; and probable it is hee did deſire, that his immortality and ſoveraignty over other creatures might be the one independent, and the other ſupreme. Now theſe and all other bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of pride, whereof wee can imagine the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature by the Serpents ſuggeſtion to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, are more than countervailed, every way over-reached by the firſt degree of the humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sonne of God. Hee was not onely like but equall to the Father, not in ſome one or few, but in all the prerogatives of the Divine nature. Hee was (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>in the forme of God,</hi> and <hi>(therefore) thought it no robbery to be equall with God.</hi> Yet hee vouchſafed to become, not like to man onely, but truely man, more then equall to other men in ſorrows and ſufferings.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whatſoever equality or ſimilitude with God it was, at which the firſt mans pride through incogitancy did aime, it was not effected, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected onely, by way of triall. He could not out of a deliberate choiſe or ſetled reſolution aſſure himſelfe that hee ſhould become ſuch as hee deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be. But the Sonne of God, who was truely God, out of unerrable, unchangeable, infinite wiſdome, determined with himſelfe to become
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7892:32"/>
truely man. How man, whileſt man, ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more than man, truely God: neither the wit of man, nor the ſubtilty of the Serpent could have deviſed; although (by divine permiſſion or grant) they had been enabled to accompliſh, whatſoever to this purpoſe they could deviſe or imagine. But the <hi>Wiſdome</hi> and Sonne of God found out a way, by which hee might ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue God, and yet become as truely man as he was God: a way by which the diverſity of theſe two natures might ſtill remaine unconfuſed without diverſity of perſons or parties. Though mans ambition had reached ſo high, as to aſpire from that condition of <hi>being</hi> wherein God had eſtated him, to bee abſolutely equall with God: yet his ambition had not been equall to that humiliation which the Son of God did not onely affect, but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine unto. For although he became a man of the ſame nature that <hi>Adam</hi> was of, or any man ſince hath been, yet was he a man of a lower conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; of as low condition as any earthly creature could be: for as the Pſalmiſt in his perſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.6.) Hee became <hi>a worme and no man, the reproach of men</hi>; one whom the very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects amongſt men did think they might ſafely tread upon with ſcorne.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For the Sonne of God to bee made man, to be made a man of this low eſtate or condition (whenceſoever hee had taken his humane ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) was a ſatisfaction all-ſufficient to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God for mans pride; a <hi>diſſolution</hi> moſt compleat of the firſt work, that our firſt Parents
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7892:33"/>
ſuffered the Devill to work in our nature; if we reſpect onely the ſubſtance of it. But that no part of Satans work, no bond or tie of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance wherewith hee had intangled our nature, might remaine undiſſolved: the Sonne of God was made of a <hi>woman</hi>; and this was to ſecure the woman, or weaker ſex, that hee came to diſſolve the works which Satan had wrought in them. For as the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>The</hi> firſt <hi>woman was in the tranſgreſsion, not the man</hi>; the man at leſt not ſo deepe in the ſame tranſgreſſion as the woman. Shee alone (for ought we reade) committed the robbery, in taking the forbidden fruit from off the tree, her huſband was the receipter onely: And by ſwallowing it by the Serpents ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhee firſt conceived and brought forth death, without her huſbands conſent or knowledge. Her tranſgreſſion was twofold: Truſt, or confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Serpents promiſe: want of credence (through pride) to Gods threatnings. To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve this work of the Devill, ſo farre as it was peculiar to the woman; the Sonne of God was conceived of a woman, without the knowledge or conſent of man. Satan uſed the Serpent for his <hi>proxie</hi> to betroth himſelfe unto our nature: the holy Ghoſt by the miniſtery of an Angel winnes the bleſſed Virgins aſſent or accord to become the mother of the Sonne of God. Seeing the firſt woman became the mother of ſinne whileſt ſhee remained a virgin, though then a wife; the Sonne of God would have a virgin for his mother, yet a virgin wife; a virgin affianced to a man. And
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7892:33"/>
thus as the firſt woman, being not begotten but made of man, did accompliſh Satans plot in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his fall, and corrupting our nature: ſo the Sonne of God being made <hi>man</hi> of a <hi>woman,</hi> doth diſſolve this work by purifying what ſhe had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and by repayring what the firſt man, and woman had undone.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There is a tradition concerning the <hi>Meſsias</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and his mothers, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd upon an ancient Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Rabbin by <hi>Petrus Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> but as I conjecture, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Commentary upon his owne fancie, or ſome Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Legendary whom hee was pleaſed to grace. The abſtract of this Legend, with his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ment upon it, is thus. There was one ſpecial part of <hi>Adams</hi> bodily ſubſtance pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged from the contagion of the firſt ſin, and this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated by one ſpeciall line unto poſterity, untill it came to the mother of the Meſsias, who from the vertue of this preſerved portion of <hi>Adams</hi> nature, was conceived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out originall ſinne, as being made out of this ſubſtance af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7892:34"/>
ſuch a maner as the <hi>Meſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> or Sonne of God was made of a virgin. <hi>Sit fides penes Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorem.</hi> We know the bleſſed Virgin was the daughter of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the daughter of <hi>David,</hi> but not by any porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Abrahams</hi> or <hi>Davids</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy altogether exempted from ſuch alterations, as the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary vertues of which all mens bodies are made, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto. Nor was the body of the <hi>Meſsias</hi> to be made of any ſuch portion of <hi>Adam</hi> perpetually exempted from the contagion of ſin original, unto the time wherein the bleſſed Virgin was affianced to <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> The firſt exemption of any portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the humane nature, or ſubſtance of <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall, was granted and wrought by the immediate hand of God in the concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Sonne by the holy Ghoſt, which was immediatly upon that ſweet aſſent of the bleſſed Virgin unto the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel <hi>Gabriel, Ecce ancilla, &amp;c.</hi>

As the Sonne of God was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Succeſſour unto <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo he was the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate heire unto the bleſſing promiſed to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> more than heire, the Author and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: He was likewiſe immediate Succeſſor unto <hi>David,</hi> and his kingdome: the onely body in whom the ſhadow of Gods mercies unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> for the good of Iſrael, and Judah was to be fulfilled. If hee had been immediate Succeſſor unto <hi>David</hi> onely, this might have occaſioned ſome ſuſpition or diſtruſt, that hee had been the Redeemer of the Jewiſh nation onely, or of the ſonnes of <hi>Iacob.</hi> Had hee been immediate Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor unto <hi>Abraham</hi> onely, this might have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned the like ſurmiſe or fancy, that hee had been manifeſted onely to diſſolve the works which Satan had wrought in <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, which was much more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple than the ſeed of <hi>Iacob.</hi> But in as much as the Sonne of God did in time become the ſonne of <hi>man,</hi> the immediate Succeſſor unto <hi>Adam,</hi> the onely ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> (though not the firſt, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond man from <hi>Adam,</hi>) This giveth us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that he was the next of kindred to all men, as they were men, whether Jewes or Gentiles.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7892:35"/>
He to whom the redemption of all mankinde did by right of kinred, without partiality, or reſpect of perſons, equally belong. And for this reaſon hee did not take any created <hi>party</hi> or <hi>perſon</hi> into the unity of his divine <hi>perſon,</hi> but the meere na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, or ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as ſequeſtred from all perſonall reſpects or references.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Thus was the Sonne of God to be qualified that his undertakings for mankinde might bee univerſally beneficiall. But the <hi>Baſis</hi> of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and undertakings in our fleſh, <hi>That,</hi> from which (being annexed to the dignity of his perſon) the intenſive infinity of the ſatisfaction for the ſinnes of the world, and our redemption from the ſervitude of Satan did reſult, <hi>was the forme of a ſervant,</hi> which hee voluntarily tooke upon him. A myſtery not much looked after, much leſſe into, by any Divines, whom it hath been my hap to reade. The moſt doe ſcarce make it ſo much as a comely metaphor, or ſignificant expreſſion of ſomewhat more than the ſtate or condition of a man. But that the <hi>forme</hi> of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant was a qualification of the Sonne of God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from his manhood may thus bee conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently proved. The nature and eſſentiall forme of man did ariſe, and doth remaine in him ſince his reſurrection from death: ſo did not the forme or condition of a ſervant; that, lies dead and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried for ever. By his reſurrection from death, he did not onely of a mortall man, become immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall; but from the eſtate or condition of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, (without the interpoſition of ought beſides

his death) was made both Lord and King of all things created by him. It will therefore bee no digreſſion to treat of the <hi>forme</hi> of a ſervant more at large in this method and order.

                  <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F legal ſervants there were two ſorts, one whom we call hired ſeruants or apprentices, whom a <hi>Latiniſt</hi> would rather call <hi>Famuli</hi> then <hi>Servi.</hi> Others were <hi>Servi,</hi> ſervants properly ſo called, ſuch as we would properly terme <hi>ſlaves</hi> or <hi>bondmen.</hi> Of <hi>ſlaves</hi> and <hi>bondmen,</hi> their Lords and Maſters had a fuller power or dominion than any Maſter hath over his hired ſervants. Not the actions onely or bodily imployment, but the perſons of ſlaves or bondmen are at their Maſters diſpoſall; they had the ſame right of dominion over them, which men have over lands which they hold in <hi>ſee ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> a power to alienate, to ſell or ſet them to any other. And for this reaſon a ſlave or bondman is in Scripture called the Inheritance of his Maſter. Of hired ſervants the actions or imployments onely are at their Maſters diſpoſall, their perſons are free: nor are their actions or imployments perpetually at their Maſters diſpoſall, but onely ſo long as the Covenant laſteth, and ſo farre onely as is covenanted betweene them. The greateſt intereſt that their Maſters can have in them is onely ſuch as a man hath in lands and grounds which hee renteth of others: the fruits are entirely his which renteth the grounds: the ſoile or inheritance is the Lords or owner of it.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7892:37"/>
The labours or imployments of an hired ſervant are his Maſters onely, his perſon is in <hi>nullîus bonis,</hi> it is not the goods or chattell of another: What he can earne or get is his owne, ſo that hee is as much a free man, as a ſervant. The true and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall difference betweene both theſe kindes of <hi>ſervants,</hi> and a <hi>free man,</hi> is this: A free man hath power to diſpoſe of his actions or imployments for his beſt advantage: A ſervant (whether by Covenant, or a bondman) albeit he hath a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable will to deſire his own good or preferment, yet hath hee no power or right to diſpoſe of his owne actions, or employments, for compaſſing that good, which as he is endued with reaſon, he could project and forcaſt. For of his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or expenſe of time, hee muſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count unto his Maſter. In reſpect of legall or ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill freedome, that uſuall definition is warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; <hi>Liber eſt qui vivit, ut vult:</hi> He is legally or civilly free which may imploy his labours or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend his time, as he pleaſeth, for his owne good, without the controll or check of others. And he is a legall ſervant <hi>qui non vivit, ut vult,</hi> which cannot beſtow himſelfe or time according to his owne deſire or will, but as his Lord or Maſter ſhall appoint. His Maſter by legall right may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a neceſſity upon him, either of not doing that which hee deſireth to doe, or of doing that which he deſireth not to doe. A ſervant may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to pleaſure himſelfe or his friend by his day labour, or other expenſe of time, but if this hee doe without his Maſters conſent or approbation,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7892:37"/>
hee wrongs his Maſter, who if hee pleaſe, may conſtraine him to doe his buſineſſe, and neglect his owne, or his friends. Againe, a ſervant may have a deſire or reſolution, not to gratifie or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure another (ſuppoſe his owne, or his friends enemie) by his ſervice or employments, and yet if he be his Maſters friend, hee may compell him to doe that partie whom hee miſlikes, that good office, or ſervice, which hee would not. Briefly, every ſervant hath a freedome of will in matters civill, but no <hi>arbitrium,</hi> no freedome of power, or right to diſpoſe of himſelfe, or of his actions for accompliſhing that which he may freely will: hee muſt frame his courſe of politick or civill life <hi>ex arbitrio Domini.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. From this difference of eſtate, or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a free man, and a ſervant, the Heathens did by light of nature rightly inferre; that every vitious man (though a Lord, though a Prince, or Monarch) was a true ſlave to his owne luſt, or leud deſires: that every wiſe, and temperate man, though a bondman for his legall ſtate and condition, was a true free man. The Roman Orator in his Paradoxes (as he entitles them) to this purpoſe, was an Orthodox. And the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the Slave in the Satyricall Poet brings to prove his Maſter to bee a greater ſlave than himſelfe, are unanſwerable, <hi>Tune mihi Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, rerum imperiis hominumque Tot tantiſque minor</hi>; Are you a Lord, and I a ſlave, when as you may bee commanded by more men, and by more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, than I am ſubject unto? The ſlave acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged

no more Maſters than this one, whom if it would pleaſe but to ſay the word, his freedome might without difficulty be obtained, if the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> of the City would but vouchſafe (by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters leave) to lay his white rod upon him, and cauſe him to be turned once or twice about with ſome few other Ceremonies, he could be turned out of a ſlave into a free Citizen, in the ſpace of an houre: whereas, if his Maſter had been turned round, (till his ſenſes had failed him) in caſe the <hi>Praetor</hi> would have laid his rod an hundred times upon his head, hee could not have wound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe out of thoſe bonds of ſervitude wherein his luſts had inſnared him. This ſlave had obſerved, that his Maſter would often commend the fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and temperance of the ancient Romans, and often deſire that hee, and other moderne Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, might live as they did: yet if any great man, or good neighbour would invite him to a luxurious feaſt, or if any fooliſh pleaſures, with whoſe exceſſe he had been formerly ſtung, ſhould proffer themſelves, he had not ſo much power to reſiſt or reſtraine them, as this ſlave had to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect his deſignes or commands, when they did diſpleaſe him. And for his Maſter to be drawne thus every day to doe that which in his retired and ſober thoughts he did moſt diſlike and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, was in his judgement a greater ſlavery than any bodily ſervitude. If the reaſons which theſe and other Heathens often uſed to prove vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious men to bee the onely true ſlaves, had not been the dictates of the law of nature written in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7892:38"/>
our hearts, or reaſons unanſwerable; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of Chriſt, yea Chriſt himſelfe would not have uſed the like. <hi>Know yee not</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 6.16. as if it were a ſhame in this point to be ignorant) <hi>that to whom yee yeeld your ſelves ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to obey, his ſervants yee are to whom yee obey: whether of ſinne unto death, or of obedience unto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</hi> And S. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us of ſome, <hi>who whileſt they promiſe liberty unto others, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were ſervants unto corruption,: for of whom a man is overcome, of the ſame is hee brought into bondage,</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19. So our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Whoſoever committeth ſinne, is the ſervant of ſinne.</hi> And of him no doubt our Apoſtle S. <hi>Iohn</hi> learned that doctrine; <hi>Hee that committeth ſinne, is of the Devill:</hi> a ſervant of his.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But albeit the wiſer ſort of Heathens did by light of nature know, that every vicious man was a ſlave or ſervant to his owne luſts or deſires: yet the greateſt danger which they apprehended from the ſervitude, was but feare of <hi>ſatyricall</hi> cenſure for prepoſterous baſeneſſe in ſubjecting reaſon, to ſenſuality. That their owne deſires, luſts, or affections, were maintained and cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by a forreigne enemie, as ſo many rebells to wage warre againſt their immortall ſoules, or that their conſciences being ſubdued by luſt, ſhould bee everlaſtingly ſubject to ſo cruell a Tyran as the Devill is, were points wherein the Prince of darkneſſe had blinded the eyes of the wiſeſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. And would to God wee Chriſtians, to whom the Lord hath revealed thus much, could
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7892:39"/>
ſee or heare ſo much concerning this doctrine, as would make us perfectly underſtand, or lay to heart the ineſtimable danger wherein wee ſtand, whether in reſpect of the faſt hold which this Tyran by our corrupted nature and cuſtome hath got of us, or of the miſerable uſage which will follow, if he and ſinne finally prevaile againſt us. But this is a common place, for which every man may finde a fitter Text in his owne heart, then any other man can chuſe for him, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of more ample and pertinent diſcourſe upon it, than reading of many books can ſuggeſt unto him. All that I have here to ſay concerning this point is, to requeſt the Reader to examine his owne heart, and calculate his non-performances of what (I preſume) hee often ſeriouſly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and perhaps hath vowed. His duty it is to open the wounds of his conſcience, either to God alone in ſecret, or to ſuch as God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Phyſicians of his ſoule and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.

                  <head>CHAP. VIII. The Sonne of God was properly a ſervant to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet not by birth as hee was the ſonne of his handmaid, but by voluntary undergoing this hard condition for the redemption of man.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O free us from this miſerable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude unto ſinne, (which alone doth wound our conſcience) the Sonne of God did freely and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily take upon him the <hi>forme</hi> of a ſervant. The parts of his peculiar ſervice were in generall two: The one, to conquer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, who was by right of conqueſt our Lord: The other, to reconcile us to grace and favour with God; to make us firſt ſervants, then ſonnes, and laſtly kings and prieſts to his, and our heavenly Father. Theſe two parts of his peculiar ſervice unto his Father, (for unto him alone hee was a ſervant) exhibit the moſt admirable paterne of juſtice, mercie, and loving kindneſſe, as well in God the Father, as God the Sonne, that the wit of man or Angels can contemplate. Firſt it was a paterne of juſtice, never after to bee parallel'd for God the Father to exact ſatisfaction for our ſinnes, at the hands of his deare and onely Sonne. Unto this unmeaſurable act, or exerciſe of juſtice upon the Sonne of righteouſneſſe, his mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us miſerable ſinners was fully commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. For whatſoever hee ſuffered for our ſakes, was from his Fathers and his owne mercy and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7892:40"/>
loving kindneſſe towards us. Againe, ſo infinite was the juſtice of our gracious God, that even whileſt hee ſhewed his mercy, and loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe towards us, he did vouchſafe to give (as we ſay) the Devill himſelfe his due, and to obſerve the law of Armes or Duell with this Prince of Rebels, his ſubject by right of Creation, but pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſſed enemie by reſolution. Albeit this grand Rebell after his revolt from God, had conquered man, and made him (by treachery) of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and ſonne, a meere ſlave unto himſelfe; the righteous Lord would not deprive this mighty Lion, and greedy Wolfe of his prey, by any other meanes, than by right of conqueſt gotten over him by man. Hee did not arme a legion of Angels, nor ſummon the whole hoſt of viſible creatures againſt him, nor uſe his omnipotent and abſolute power to deſtroy or annihilate him, or as then to ſhut him up in the everlaſting pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The exerciſes of ſuch power whether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly by the omnipotent Creator himſelfe, or by his creatures, had been more than Satans <hi>matches,</hi> upon equall termes, or weapons. Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of ſtrength was not the firſt way in the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God to conquer pride, ambition, or vaine glory, though theſe muſt bee quelled with the power and ſtrength of the Sonne of God, whom it pleaſed the Father at the firſt onſet to weaken, by laying our firſt Parents infirmities, and their poſterities upon him. Theſe were the weapons by which he foiled the old Serpent, and obtained the victory by managing our <hi>weakneſſe</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:7892:40"/>
and <hi>infirmities,</hi> better then our firſt Parents did thoſe great abilities, wherewith their Creator had endowed them to reſiſt temptations. The weapons which the old Serpent uſed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of our firſt Parents, and by which hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their poſterity in continuall ſlavery, were their owne deſires and affections; theſe hee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved ſo farre that they became unweeldy. And he having gotten (as wee ſay) the better end of the ſtaffe, did wreſt our wills at his pleaſure, to doe thoſe things which God forbids us to do, and make us furious executioners of his cunning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances againſt our own ſoules. The particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his ſleights or cunning for bringing us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thraldome inextricable, (unleſſe the Sonne of God ſet us free) are elſwhere deciphered. Theſe two are the maine generals: Firſt, the extenſion of our naturall deſire of things within their bounds good and pleaſant. Secondly, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of our feare of things diſtaſtfull to nature, as of death, diſgrace or torture. Now that the Sonne of God might thus beate him at his owne weapons, it was neceſſary that he ſhould firſt take upon him the <hi>forme</hi> or eſſentiall condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſervant: for without this, firſt volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily undertaken by him, the rule of juſtice could not poſſibly have ſuffered him, to have ſuffered ſo much as he did, for our redemption. Wherein then did the ſtate, or condition of a ſervant, which he tooke upon him formally conſiſt? Or when did he firſt become a ſervant? from the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his birth or conception?</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:7892:41"/>2. I cannot brooke their opinion, who think our Saviour was by birth a legall ſervant, as being <hi>filius ancillae,</hi> the ſonne of an handmaid or <hi>bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman.</hi> This groſſe hereſie hath been well refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſome late Schoolemen, whoſe names I now remember not, nor the names of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors or abettors of this opinion. The mother of the Sonne of God was indeed <hi>ancilla,</hi> an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, but to him onely whoſe ſervice is perfect freedome. So the Pſalmiſt in the perſon of the Sonne of God (to be manifeſted in our fleſh) or as his type, directs his prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.16. <hi>O Lord truely I am thy ſervant, and the ſonne of thy hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid.</hi> CHRIST (as all Chriſtians grant) was the Sonne of Gods Handmaid, after ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and in ſuch a ſenſe, as never any man beſides him was. For hee was the promiſed womans ſeed, and the ſonne of a woman in ſuch a ſort, as hee was not the ſonne of any man. Againe, hee was the ſervant of God, after ſuch a peculiar manner, as neither man or woman had been, or ever ſhall be. But how doth this peculiar ſervice of his fit our ſervitude unto ſinne? Even as the medicine doth the diſeaſe, or as the plaiſter doth the wound for which it is prepared. In the Sonne of God made man there were two diſtinct wills; the one truely Divine, the other truely humane. To deny this diſtinction of wills in Chriſt, were to revive the hereſie of the <hi>Monothelites</hi> ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, becauſe they held but one will in Chriſt; to wit, the Divine. An errour into which they haply fell (as many ſince their time have done
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7892:41"/>
into a worſe) by not diſtinguiſhing betweene <hi>voluntas,</hi> and <hi>arbitrium.</hi> Our Saviour CHRIST whileſt hee lived here on earth, had a reaſonable <hi>will</hi> of the ſame nature, or quality our will is of (ſinne excepted.) And by this will he could not but deſire his owne particular good; as health, welfare, and other lawfull contentments of the humane nature, which are requiſite to true joy or happineſſe. But in as much as the Sonne of God from the beginning of mans ſervitude unto Satan became our Surety, &amp; to make ſatisfaction for our ſins did in the fulneſſe of time take our nature upon him: hee did wholly ſubmit his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable will, all his affections and deſires unto the will of his heavenly Father. And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of the arbitrament of his will, and in the entire ſubmiſſion of it unto the will of his Father, did that <hi>forme</hi> of a ſervant, whereof our Apoſtle ſpeakes, formally conſiſt. For unto the eſſentiall definition, or conſtitution of a ſervant, theſe two onely concurre. Firſt, the uſe of reaſon. (for fooles, infants, or reaſonleſſe creatures can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee ſervants) Secondly, <hi>Carentia arbitrii proprii,</hi> want of right or arbitrary power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of their bodily actions or employments, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deſire or lawfull choiſe of their reaſonable will. So then the generall definition, or abſtract forme of a ſervant is univocally the ſame, 1 in <hi>legall ſervants,</hi> 2 in ſervants to ſin, and 3 in the Sonne of God, during the time of his humiliation here on earth, or whileſt hee became hoſtage for our Redemption, But the ſervice of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7892:42"/>
theſe three ſorts of ſervants is in the concrete moſt different. And the difference ariſeth from the matter or ſubject in which they are reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively deprived of proper right, or arbitrary power to diſpoſe of themſelves, or of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. A legall ſervant wants power to diſpoſe of his employments or bodily actions in matters temporary concerning this life. Servants to ſin (ſuch all the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> are by nature) want power to diſpoſe of their actions, or courſe of life in matters morall, ſpirituall, or ſuch as concerne their conſciences. All, and every one of us have a deſire to be happy, and yet all of us until we be freed by the Son of God from this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſervitude, are by the prince of darkneſſe uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diverted from this ſtrait way which leads to happineſſe, unto the crooked by-paths which tend to death, and inextricable miſery. The Sonne of God although according to his humane nature, hee had a reaſonable will and deſire of happineſſe, which could never in any particular become exorbitant, or diverted from that which is moſt holy and juſt: yet even hee in the dayes of his humiliation wanted power to reape the wages of righteouſneſſe, or fruits of holineſſe. Though joy and comfort was as pleaſant to him, as to any man beſides, though compleat happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was due unto him, as hee was a moſt juſt and righteous man perſonally united to the Son of God: yet having taken upon him the <hi>forme</hi> of a ſervant hee did with unſpeakeable patience, and obedience, beare all the griefes and ſorrows
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7892:42"/>
which Satan and his inſtruments, by divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, could invent against him, and cheerefully undergoe the heavieſt burden which his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father was pleaſed to lay upon him for our redemption.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From this peculiar condition of a ſervant which the Sonne of God did voluntarily take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that maine objection which ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne <hi>Arrians</hi> or <hi>Photinians</hi> make againſt the abſolute ſatisfaction of our Lord Redeemer, for our ſinnes, may eaſily bee anſwered, or rather will diſſolve it ſelfe. God (ſay theſe men) could not without tyrannicall injuſtice require full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for the miſdemeanors of all wicked and naughty men from one moſt juſt, and holy man. <hi>To ſlay the righteous with the wicked, that bee farre from thee, O Lord,</hi> was the ſaying of <hi>Abraham</hi> to God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.25. But farther ſurely it is, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hath been, from the Judge of all the world, (who is the eternall living rule of juſtice it ſelfe) to put the innocent and righteous, to the lingring and cruell tortures of an ignominious death, for redeeming wicked and cruell men from deſerved death; or to purchaſe not the impunity onely, but the advancement of willfull rebelle, by the ſevere puniſhment of his deare, and onely obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Sonne.<note place="margin">The 7. book of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries upon the Creed. cha. 25. §. 3, 4, &amp;c.</note> This objection (as was in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Treatiſe intimated) would pierce deepe, if wee were diſarmed of thoſe Chriſtian principles which theſe moderne heretiques have caſt aſide, to wit, the plurality of perſons in the Trinitie, and the Oneneſſe of perſon in the Sonne of God,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7892:43"/>
CHRIST JESUS, God and man; even whileſt he was inveſted with the forme of a ſervant. We beleeve, and confeſſe as they doe, there is but one God; and yet in this God, wee acknowledge as they doe not, <hi>unum &amp; alium,</hi> one perſon of the Father, another of the Sonne, another of the holy Ghoſt, ſuch a diſtinction of capacities that the Father, not the Sonne exacts ſatisfaction for mans violation of the eternall and indiſpenſable rule of equity and juſtice: that God the Sonne, not God the Father, did become mans ſurety, and undertake to make full ſatisfaction for all his ſinnes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Now he that will make ſatisfaction to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other muſt have ſomewhat to give of his owne, ſo his owne, as it is not the others to whom it is given. What then had the Sonne of God to give by way of ſatisfaction unto God the Father, or to the holy Ghoſt, which was ſo his owne, as it was not theirs? Onely that part of our nature which hee tooke from the ſubſtance of his mother into the unitie of his Divine perſon. In all other parts of our nature, over all other parts of this univerſe, God the Father, and God the Holy Ghoſt had the ſame <hi>intereſt,</hi> or <hi>right of dominion</hi> with the Sonne. Now this part or our nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus aſſumed into the unitie of the Second Perſon: The Sonne of God, and the Sonne of the bleſſed Virgin doe not differ, as party and party. There is <hi>unum &amp; aliud,</hi> one <hi>nature</hi> of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, another of the <hi>manhood, non unus, &amp; alius,</hi> not one perſon of the Godhead, another of the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7892:43"/>
manhood. The Divine nature in the perſon of the Sonne, is the onely party which undertooke our redemption: the humane nature aſſumed into the unity of his Perſon, was but his qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, an appendance, or appurtenance, no true part of his Perſon. And (as heretofore hath been obſerved) albeit the fleſh of the man Chriſt Jeſus was <hi>Caro humana, non divina,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The 7. book of Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries upon the Creed. Chap. 30. § 10. &amp;c.</note> fleſh of the ſame nature and ſubſtance with our fleſh: yet were his fleſh and blood more truely the fleſh and blood of the Sonne of God, than of the man CHRIST JESUS: the humane body more truely and properly his owne, than our bodies are ours. Now our fleſh, and bodily parts are ſaid to bee our owne, not ſo much becauſe they are parts of our nature, as becauſe they are appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of our perſons, or becauſe wee have a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar perſonall right or power ſo to diſpoſe of them, as to make them no parts of our nature. Wee accompt it no unnaturall part in wiſe men to cut off any rotten or putrified member, rather than ſuffer the whole body beſides utterly to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. In ſome certaine caſes, publicke Societies, or Communities of men (none of which have the like peculiar authority over the meaneſt free private member, as every owner of a body natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall hath over his teeth, his toes, his fingers, or other leſſe principall part neceſſary for ſome uſes onely: not for the preſervation of the whole) have by publique conſent deſigned ſometimes ſome principall members of the Communitie, ſometimes members leſſe principall, not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7892:44"/>
of any crime, as ſacrifices for redeeming others from preſent danger, or for ſecuring po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity from ſervitude, or oppreſſion. And when outrages have been committed by great Armies, the Authors or principall Incentives of the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinie being unknowne, or not convicted by legall proofe, the expiation hath uſually been made by decimation. Every tenth man hath by whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome diſcipline of warre been puniſhed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the demerits of the crime committed. But albeit every tenth man ſince <hi>Adam</hi> had been by him and his ſucceſſors conſent devoted to death, or lingring torture farre worſe than death: their execution could have made no expiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no ſatisfaction unto God for the tranſgreſſions of the whole Community. The attempt of the medicine would have increaſed the malignity of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall diſeaſe. Yea albeit the Son of God could have been by man intreated to practice this cure which is uſed by private wiſe men for preſervation of their naturall bodies, or by great Commanders for preuenting mutinies or loſſe of Armies: all this had not been ſufficient to have redeemed the world, or the whole Community of men from utter ruine and deſtruction; or (which is worſe then both) from everlaſting ſervitude unto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. Men by art, or rather Artiſts, by the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Gods providence, have found out reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies againſt venemous diſeaſes by medicinall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of venemous ingredients. The poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous bitings of the Scorpion are uſually cured by the oile of Scorpions: and of the fleſh of ſome
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7892:44"/>
Serpents, Phyſicians make ſoveraigne antidotes for preventing poiſon, or for curing venemous diſeaſes. But the venome which the old Serpent had diffuſed, not through the veines onely, but through the whole nature of man, was not cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by this courſe of phyſick. The old Serpent was to be deſtroyed, but not to become any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient in this Catholique medicine, whereby the humane nature was to be cured. That, by the wiſdome of God was taken out of the nature and ſubſtance wounded, not from the ſubſtance which did wound or ſting. But this part of the nature wounded, which was to bee the medicine for the reſt, was firſt to bee perfectly cured, and throughly purified by perſonall unition to the Sonne of God. And being thus purified, and cleanſed from all ſpot of ſinne, it was disfigured and mangled that the blood of it might bee as a balſamum, and quinteſſence to heale the wounds, and ſores of our corruption. If it were the will and pleaſure of the Sonne of God to ſubmit his moſt holy body unto the good will, and pleaſure of his moſt holy Father; if with his conſent and approbation it were bruiſed, and mangled: here was no wrong done to any man, but on Gods part rather a document of his unſpeakable love unto mankinde: Love unexpreſſible on God the Fathers part that would ſuffer his onely Sonne to take upon him the true forme of a ſervant, and undergoe ſuch hard ſervice for us: Love unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible on God the Sonnes behalfe that did ſo willingly expoſe his humane body to paine and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7892:45"/>
torture for our redemption. Here was no wrong at all either to the Sonne of God from God the Father, or to the humane nature of Chriſt from the Godhead, or Divine perſon of the Sonne; rather all indignities, and harmes which were done unto the man CHRIST JESUS by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and his inſtruments did redound unto the Sonne of God. The humane nature was the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubject of the wound and paine. The Sonne of God was the onely ſubject (if wee may ſo ſpeake) of the wrong, the onely party or perſon wronged by Satan and his inſtruments; but no way wronged by the Father, much leſſe by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as having free power to put that part of our nature which he aſſumed, unto what ſervice ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his Father would require. Concerning this laſt qualification of the Sonne of God, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to ſay in this Treatiſe, ſave onely how it was foretold, or foreſhadowed. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions that the Sonne of God, or the Meſſias, ſhould become a ſervant, are frequent in the old Teſtament, and will here and there interpoſe themſelves in ſome enſuing diſcuſſions of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings for diſſolving the works of Satan. The next inquirie is, how it was foreſhadowed, or ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pically foretold.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He forme of a ſervant which the Sonne of God did take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, was foreſhadowed by all thoſe holy men (Prophets or other) which are by ſacred Writers inſtiled the <hi>Servants</hi> of God. A title not uſually gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to many Kings or Prieſts, not once (I take it) by God himſelfe unto <hi>Abraham</hi>; though he were the greateſt of holy men, which were but men; the father of the faithfull, whether Kings, Prieſts, or Prophets: the onely Prophet, Prieſt, or other, which (to my remembrance) was inſtiled the friend of God. <hi>Moſes, Aaron,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> are ſometimes inſtiled the ſervants of God, by God himſelfe. Yet were theſe three (reſpectively) more illuſtrious types of the Sonne of God, as he was to bee made King, Prieſt, and Prophet, than of <hi>him</hi> as hee tooke the forme of a ſervant upon him. Of CHRIST JESUS as hee was in a peculiar ſort the ſervant of God, <hi>Iob</hi> the moſt remarkable paterne of patience (before this Son of God was manifeſted in the fleſh) is the moſt exact type or ſhadow; not for his qualifications onely, but in his undertakings. <hi>Iobs</hi> conflicts with Satan, and wreſtlings with temptations are more

expreſly recorded, and more emphatically ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, than any mans beſides, before the onely Sonne of God became the Sonne of man, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to his heavenly Father. Satan by ſpeciall leave obtained from God (but ſo obtained by God as challenger) did combat or play his prizes with this ſervant of God, at two the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent weapons, which his cunning and long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience upon all aduantages, which the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men (from the fall of <hi>Adam</hi>) did afford him, could make choiſe of. And theſe two wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons were; [hope of good things, and feare of evills temporall] which this great uſurper did preſume were at his diſpoſall, either by right of that conqueſt which hee had gotten over the firſt man, or could obtaine by Gods permiſſion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare the firſt mans poſterity. The direct and full ſcope of all our hopes is felicitie; and ſo is miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the period of all our feares. Unto felicity three ſorts of good things are required, <hi>Bona ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae, bona fortunae, bona corporis.</hi> The endowments and contentments of the reaſonable ſoule; health with ability, and lawfull contentments of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; competency of meanes or worldly ſubſtance, which are ſubſervient to both the former en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments and contentments of ſoule and body. No miſery can befall man, but either from the want of ſome one or more of theſe three good things which are required to happineſſe (as the Philoſophers conceived it) or from their contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. All the evills which men naturally feare, are either evills incident to the body; as ſickneſſe,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7892:46"/>
paine, torments, death, want or loſſe of goods, or worldly ſubſtance, loſſe of good name, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace or ignominy, imputation of folly, which are no leſſe grievous to the rationall part of man, than paine or griefe are to the part ſenſitive; more grievous by much to ingenuous men, than loſſe of goods, than want or penury. For as an heathen Satyriſt well obſerved;
<q>
                        <l>Nil habet infoelix paupertas durius in ſe,</l>
                        <l>Quam quòd ridiculos homines facit.</l>
                     </q>
The ſhrewdeſt turne that poverty can doe to any mortall creature, is to expoſe him unto contempt or ſcorne. By feare of all theſe three evills Satan driveth moſt men into his ſnare of ſervitude; as many, if not more, as hee drawes into the ſame ſnare by hope of good things. By every one of theſe three evills, by the very leaſt of them, if we take them ſingle, hee had caught ſo many as hee thought ſufficient to make up this generall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction: [<hi>That none could eſcape his ſnares or ſpringes, ſo hee might be permitted by God to take his opportunities for ſetting them.</hi>]</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Iob</hi> was a man as happy as any man before him had been, according to that ſcale of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which Philoſophers could hope for in this life, or could make any probable ground of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hopes for the life to come. <hi>There was a man</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>in the land of Vz, whoſe name was Iob, and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eſchewed evill.</hi> This is a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7892:47"/>
fuller expreſſion than any Philoſopher could make of the principall part of happineſſe, that is of a minde richly endowed with all kinde of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues moral; and more than ſo, with ſpirituall graces. <hi>And there were borne unto him ſeven ſons, and three daughters</hi>; theſe were more than <hi>bona corporis,</hi> more than parts of his perſonall conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which beſides theſe was exceeding good. <hi>His ſubſtance alſo was ſeven thouſand ſheepe, and three thouſand Camels, and five hundred yoke of Oxen, and five hundred ſhee Aſſes, and a very great houſhold (or husbandry,</hi> great ſtore no doubt of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants which were part of his worldly ſubſtance) <hi>ſo that this man was the greateſt of all the men of the Eaſt.</hi> Here was a great meaſure of thoſe things which Philoſophers call <hi>bona fortunae, goods of fortune,</hi> or (as we now ſay) <hi>goodly meanes, faire revenues. Iob</hi> was a richer man for thoſe times in reſpect of others, than any man this day living is in reſpect of our times. Yet this goodly Cedar in his full height was <hi>ſound within,</hi> and <hi>ſtraight without,</hi> unſhaken by any blaſts of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer temptations, untill the Lord himſelf appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to bee a Dueller with Satan. The chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge made by Satan is very remarkable. <hi>There was a day when the ſonnes of God came to preſent themſelves before the Lord, and Satan came alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. And the Lord ſaid unto Satan, whence commeſt thou? Then Satan anſwered the Lord and ſaid, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and downe in it. And the Lord ſaid unto Satan. Haſt thou conſidered my ſervant Iob, that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7892:47"/>
there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right man, one that feareth God, and eſcheweth evill? ver.</hi> 6, 7, 8. Satan would not beleeve the Lords commendations of this righteous man: for hee <hi>anſwered the Lord, and ſaid, Deth Iob feare God for naught? Haſt not thou made an hedge about him, and about his houſe, and about all that hee hath on everie ſide? Thou haſt bleſſed the work of his hands, and his ſubſtance is increaſed in the land. But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that hee hath, and hee will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> After the Lord had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Satan to try the utmoſt of his ſkill at this firſt weapon [loſſe of goods, and loſſe of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.] <hi>Iob</hi> by his Antagoniſts confeſſion came off with honour: hee ſtill continued Gods faithfull ſervant. <hi>He aroſe</hi> (ſaith the text) upon the heavy newes of his univerſall loſſe of goods and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) <hi>and rent his mantle, and ſhaved his head, and fell downe upon the ground, and worſhipped and ſaid, Naked came I out of my mothers wombe, and naked ſhall I returne thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: bleſſed bee the Name of the Lord.</hi> In all this <hi>Iob</hi> did not ſinne, <hi>ver.</hi> 20, 21, 22. Yet is not Satan his Antagoniſt daunted with this baughle, but craves leave to try his ſkil at another weapon; for ſo it followes: <hi>Againe, there was a day when the ſonnes of God came to preſent themſelves before the Lord, and Satan came alſo among them to preſent himſelfe before the Lord, &amp;c. And the Lord ſaid unto Satan, Haſt thou conſidered my ſervant Iob, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and eſcheweth
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7892:48"/>
evill? and ſtill hee holdeth faſt his integrity, although thou movedſt me againſt him, to deſtroy him without a cauſe. And Satan anſwered the Lord and ſaid, Skin for skinne, yea all that a man hath, will hee give for his life. But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his fleſh, and hee will curſe thee to thy face. And the Lord ſaid unto Satan, Behold hee is in thine hand, onely ſave his life, Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 3, 4, 5, 6. Having this licence granted him, hee fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlowes no time for putting it in ſpeedy execution. <hi>So went Satan forth from the preſence of the Lord and ſmote Iob with ſore boiles, from the ſole of his foote unto his crowne: and he tooke him a potſheard to ſcrape himſelfe withall, and hee ſate downe among the aſhes, ver.</hi> 7, 8.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the firſt temptation (which was loſſe of goods) <hi>Iob</hi> did not ſinne ſo much as in word. So farre hee was from ſinning in word, ſo farre from murmuring at this ſudden change, that he ſetteth a copy not of patience onely, but of thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for temporall croſſes or calamities. In the ſecond temptation, which was more terrible, hee ſo far a while reſiſted, as if hee had purpoſed to make an atonement for <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, in raſhly yeelding to his wives ſuggeſtion. For when <hi>Iobs</hi> wife did ſeeke to miſperſwade him, <hi>Doſt thou ſtill retaine thy integrity? Curſe God and die</hi>; hee thus replied: <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt as one of the fooliſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſpeaketh. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and ſhall we not receive evill? ver.</hi> 9, 10. Yet that <hi>Iob</hi> in the continuance of this ſecond temptation did not ſinne, is more than the word
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7892:48"/>
of God will warrant us to avouch. Certainely he was a ſinner, and did actually ſinne in this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, though not in ſo high a degree, as his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable comforters ſuppoſed him to have ſinned, long before this miſery did befall him. They thought the exceſſe of his afflictions in reſpect of the ordinary afflictions which other men did ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, did preſuppoſe an exceſſe of ſinne in him, and that his preſent ſufferings did convince him of former hypocriſie, which is the worſt of ſins. Yet ſome ground they had of this perſwaſion or ſuſpition: for few or none within their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or before their times had fallen into ſuch a depth of miſery, as <hi>Iob</hi> now had done, without ſome exceſſive height of ſinne in ſome one kind, or other. Yet <hi>Iobs</hi> friends in the extent of their collections did if not groſly ſinne, yet fowly erre in their particular application. For <hi>Iobs</hi> caſe was extraordinary: his temptations were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all former example. In reſpect or order of time, hee was the firſt and moſt remarkable pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of patience, which the Scripture hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed unto us. No righteous man, or true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God before him had been ſo afflicted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in body, in loſſe of goods, or eſteeme with men, with friends eſpecially, as this moſt upright and faithfull ſervant of God was. The titles gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him by God himſelfe of perfectneſſe and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe extraordinary, if wee compare them with his extraordinary temptations and grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, doe argue, that hee was the ſervant of God after a more peculiar maner than others had been;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7892:49"/>
a remarkable ſervant not onely in reſpect of his ſanctity and integrity, but as a ſpeciall type and figure of the Sonne of God, who was in ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ages to take the forme of a ſervant upon him, and in this forme to be expoſed to more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible combats with Satan, than <hi>Iob</hi> had been, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though as man he were more upright and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than <hi>Iob.</hi> And beſides ſuch Saints of God, as were peculiar types of the Sonne of God, or of the man CHRIST JESUS in the dayes of his affliction; That induction made by <hi>Eliphas, Iob</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8, 9. was univerſally true in reſpect of thoſe times, and theſe enſuing. <hi>Remember I pray thee, who ever periſhed being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off? Even as I have ſeene, they that plough iniquity, and ſow wickedneſſe, reape the ſame. By the blaſt of God they periſh, and by the breath of his noſe-thrills are they conſumed.</hi> That of the Pſalmiſt (whether <hi>David</hi> or ſome other) was univerſally true, not of his times onely, but of after-times alſo, though true of later times with the former allowance or exception, of ſuch as were ſpeciall types of Chriſt in his affliction. <hi>I have been young, and now am old, yet have I not ſeene the righteous forſaken, nor his ſeed begging their bread, Pſal.</hi> 37.25.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. X. How the Sonne of God did conquer Satan at thoſe weapons, wherewith hee had conquered our firſt Parents.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the Sonne of God was manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to diſſolve the works of the Devill, our Evangeliſt S. <hi>Iohn</hi> hath taught us: and S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> had told him, and others as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>I knew him not</hi> (ſaith this his forerunner) <hi>but that he ſhould be manifeſted unto Iſrael, therefore I come baptizing with water, And Iohn bare record, ſaying, I ſaw the Spirit deſcending from heaven like a Dove and it reſted upon him,</hi> Ioh. 1.31, 32. But did this manifeſtation declare, or manifeſt his purpoſe to diſſolve or deſtroy the works of the Devill? Yes. Immediatly upon his baptiſme, hee gave Iſrael and the world juſt proofe, that the end of his manifeſtation, was to take away the ſinnes of mankinde, and for this reaſon hee began to untwiſt that triple cord, wherewith our firſt Parents, and in them their whole poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity were bound by Satan. For albeit the firſt ſinne found entrance into our nature by incogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy, and had its period or accompliſhment in pride; yet were not pride or incogitancy the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrings of that ſnare, wherein Satan had taken us. The bonds and ties by which hee tooke, and holds us captive, are mentioned by S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, 2. <hi>Chap. ver.</hi> 15, 16. <hi>Love not the world,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7892:50"/>
nor the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.</hi> From theſe three heads or ſources, all the overflowing of ungodlineſſe may be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and theſe found entrance into this viſible world through our firſt Parents folly, and Satans ſubtilty. For albeit the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life, tooke their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ſpecificall being, or live-ſhape from the firſt ſinne, yet were the ſeeds of all theſe ſinnes ſowen by Satan in our firſt Parents ſoules and ſenſes, before the body of ſinne with its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were framed, or animated.
<q>There was an extravagant deſire of the eye, an irregular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of the fleſh, by which the Serpent tolled on the firſt woman to eat the forbidden fruit; and the eating of it did hatch this three-fold brood in kinde.</q>
                     <hi>The woman</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes Gen.</hi> 3.6.) <hi>ſaw</hi> (through falſe ſpectacles of Satans ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king) <hi>that the tree was good for food:</hi> (here was the embryon or ſeed of the luſt of the fleſh) <hi>and that it was pleaſant to the eye</hi>; (here were the firſt lineaments of the luſt of the eye) <hi>and a tree to bee deſired to make one wiſe</hi>: (this was the inchoation of the pride of life) <hi>And ſhee tooke of the fruit thereof and did eate, and gave alſo to her husband, and hee did eate:</hi> and by their eating, the former <hi>deſire</hi> of forbidden food was turned into the luſt of the fleſh: The <hi>curioſity</hi> of the eye was turned into the <hi>luſt</hi> of the eye; and the <hi>deſire</hi> of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7892:50"/>
or proper excellency, was changed into the <hi>pride of life.</hi> So that the truth of S. <hi>Iames</hi> his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14. was remarkably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, in the manner of our firſt Parents fall. <hi>Let no man ſay when hee is tempted, I am tempted of God. For God cannot bee tempted with evill, neither tempteth be any man. But every man is tempted when hee is drawen away of his owne luſt, and entiſed. Then when luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth ſinne; and ſinne, when it is finiſhed, bringeth forth death.</hi> Now to diſſolve theſe three temptations or cords of vanity, wherewith our firſt Parents were taken captives: the Sonne of God, immediatly upon his Baptiſme, was led by the Spirit into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe to be tempted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our firſt Parents being placed in Paradiſe (a place furniſhed with variety and plenty of food) by too much indulgence unto their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, or by incogitancie to bridle it by reaſon, could not abſtaine from that fruit which onely was forbidden them. Power they had to have abſtained: but they did not uſe it, when they had no neceſſity, no urgent provocation to eate at all, much leſſe to eate of that fruit. The Sonne of God made a man more ſubject to bodily harmes by long forbearance of meat, than our firſt Parents were: after forty dayes continuance in a vaſt and barren wilderneſſe, wherein no food or fruit did grow, could not in his hunger bee tempted to eate any food which the ordinary providence of God did not reach unto him. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geus iedam neceſsitas, Neceſsity</hi> (as we ſay) <hi>hath no
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7892:51"/>
law:</hi> there is no fence againſt it: <hi>Cogit ad turpia,</hi> it makes men, otherwiſe honeſt, to doe many things which are not comely. And, for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the great tempter at the firſt <hi>bout,</hi> aſſaults our Saviour with this <hi>fiery dart</hi> of <hi>neceſsity. If thou be the Sonne of God, command that theſe ſtones be made bread.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Long faſting hath made it apparant that thou art a man ſubject to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and infirmity; and (if thou be withall the Sonne of God) thou canſt, and a neceſſity is laid upon thee, as man, to provide thy ſelfe of food, for without food man cannot live. Yet this <hi>fiery dart</hi> (though <hi>ſteeled</hi> and <hi>pointed</hi> with the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting delight of manifeſting his owne worth or excellencie) is wholly diverted by that <hi>ſhield</hi> of Faith: <hi>It is written, Man ſhall not live by bread one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but by every word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God:</hi> So <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſaid unto Iſrael, <hi>I fed thee with Manna, to teach thee, that man liveth not by bread, but by every word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God, doth man live.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 8.3.</note> Iſrael then did live for a long time both by <hi>Manna,</hi> and by the word of God; on which, without <hi>Manna,</hi> they would not have relied. <hi>Manna</hi> was as the body, and the word of God ſpoken by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as the ſoule, or ſpirit of that food, by which they lived: both <hi>Manna,</hi> and that word of God, make but an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem or type of the eternall Word of God, who is the food of life; Life it ſelfe; and yet at this time (as man) was an hungred. So then, as hee was the Sonne of God, hee was able of ſtones to make bread, and as he was a man ſubject to infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7892:51"/>
hee had juſt occaſion at this time to uſe his power. Yet as man inveſted with the <hi>forme</hi> of a ſervant, he could not be induced to uſe this power. For as hee often profeſſeth, he came not to doe his owne will; no not in things lawfull and moſt agreeable to nature: but the will of him that ſent him, though that did enjoyne him to doe or ſuffer things moſt diſpleaſant to nature. This was the time, wherein he was by his Father appointed to conquer the irregular appetite of the ſenſe of taſte, and the luſt of the fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Our firſt Parents being Gods Vicegerents here on earth, Lords of all his viſible creatures, not therewith content, by Satans inticements aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired to be like unto God, higher than Angels, than other powers or principalities. The Sonne of God, albeit hee were by nature Lord of men, and Lord of Angels; cannot be allured to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his command over them, albeit they were commanded to attend him. Satans pretence in his ſecond aſſault was very faire, and ſeemed to be countenanced by Scripture. <hi>If thou bee the Sonne of God, caſt thy ſelfe downe, for it is written; Hee ſhall give his Angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they ſhall beare thee up, leſt at any time thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone.</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 91.11, 12.</note> Fitter occaſion to any mans ſeeming could not be offered for the exquiſite verification or exact fulfilling of this Prophecy, than by this adventure to throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe downe from the pinacle of the Temple. But the Sonne of God, who gave the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now made under the Law, ſubmits himſelfe
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7892:52"/>
unto that legall precept; <hi>Thou ſtalt not tempt the Lord thy God</hi>; and with this Scripture retorts Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans attempted blow upon himſelfe. But what temptation of God had it been in the Sonne of God to have throwen himſelfe downe from the pinacle of the Temple, to have given proofe that hee had been that juſt man, over whom God had given his Angels charge? Some there bee, who reply, that Satan did alledge this Scripture imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently, imperfectly. For the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, to keepe thee in all thy wayes.</hi> Now the wayes of men are not in the aire, but upon the earth. This interpretation I neither much diſlike, nor altogether approve; becauſe our Saviour doth not taxe Satan for his impertinent, or imperfect allegation of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Scripture. Nor doe I ſee any reaſon why flying in the aire might not be one of the wayes of the Sonne of God made man, as well as wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon the Sea in a tempeſt; if ſo it had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, or his heavenly Father, by whoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment or diſpoſing hee did doe or ſuffer all things. Now it was his Fathers will, that by his walking on the water he ſhould manifeſt himſelfe to be the Sonne of God, able to command either winde or water. It was likewiſe his Fathers will, that at this time as man hee ſhould conquer the pride of life, or that deepely implanted deſire in all men of proper excellency, or advancing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before due time. By this free reſignation of his authority over the Angels, hee makes ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for our firſt Parents pride in ſeeking to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7892:52"/>
advance themſelves above the Angels.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Againe, Paradiſe did affoord our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents as full ſatisfaction for the delight of the eye, as it did for food: and yet deſire of that food which they needed not, found entrance into their hearts or fancies by their eyes. But the Sonne of God being made the Sonne of man, having neither place to lay his head, nor any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for the preſent to pleaſe his eye; had all the kingdomes of the earth, and their glory repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto him, with proffer of their ſale or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation rather, onely upon condition that hee would doe that homage unto this great Prince of the world, which many Princes doe to Kings or Emperours: or Emperours themſelves had done to Popes or Prelates. The pretence was faire, and the temptation the ſtrongeſt of all the three. For what man, who is but meere man, would not adventure upon any practice for the gaining the Kingdome or Monarchy which their Anceſtors had fooliſhly loſt. Now <hi>Adam</hi> was Lord and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of this viſible world, untill hee ſuffered himſelfe to bee conquered by Satan, who did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine <hi>de facto,</hi> if not by right of conqueſt, the Prince of it, and Lord of men; untill the Sonne of God made man did throw him out of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But that houre of his was nor yet come: ſo farre was hee from affecting the kingdomes of this world, that hee was yet acting the part of a ſervant in it; but a ſervant to his father onely, not to men or Princes in this world. Of how meane a condition ſoever he were as man, yet he
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7892:53"/>
diſdained to worſhip men or Angels though but with civill worſhip, for any preferment: and therefore diſmiſſes this great Uſurper thus with indignation, <hi>Avoid Satan.</hi> Satan, it ſeemes had a prenotion or ſuſpition that Chriſt was that Juſt and holy man, whom the Pſalmiſt deſcribes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. Or ſuch a Sonne of God, as they were which appeared before the Lord, when he was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to tempt <hi>Iob.</hi> That hee was the onely Sonne of God, or equall with God, was more than hee then knew.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Theſe three temptations wherein our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our foiled Satan, are parallel'd to the firſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Iob,</hi> which was loſſe of worldly ſubſtance; more generally all the evills which the Sonne of God did ſuffer in our fleſh, or whileſt he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with men in the forme of a ſervant, did beare Analogie to the Evills which <hi>Iob</hi> did ſuffer, but for particulars more in number, and more grievous: there was no evill that comes <hi>ab extra</hi> which hee ſuffered not in greater meaſure, than <hi>Iob</hi> did any. As for loſſe of goods or worldly ſubſtance, <hi>Iob</hi> made no reckoning: the Sonne of God, though heire of all things, did not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe ſo much as to grace theſe by being owner, or poſſeſſor of them: He renounced the world, and all things in the world before he came into it: he would not be intangled or medle with them, that he might pleaſe him, who had choſen him to be his ſouldier, his onely champion in this great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with the Prince of darkneſſe.

                  <head>CHAP. XI. A parallel between <hi>Jobs</hi> ſecond temptation, and the Sonne of Gods ſufferings in our fleſh before the houre of his Agony or his Croſſe.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Ob was ſmitten with ſores, from the crowne of his head, to the ſoles of his feet; his diſeaſe was more than naturall, at leaſt incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: for he was thus ſmitten by Satan. But was the Sonne of God thus ſmitten? <hi>durum eſt affirmare.</hi> Satan had no power thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly to ſmite him. For bodily diſeaſes, wee doe not reade of any that did take poſſeſſion of his ſacred body: wee reade that he cured all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſeaſes, but never ſtood in need of the Phyſicians helpe for himſelfe. No diſeaſe did breed in his body being free from ſinne; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anointed to cure all, he did not, hee could not take any by contagion. But though hee cured all manner of diſeaſes, or all the diſeaſed which were brought unto him; yet we doe not reade that he cured all in Judea which were diſeaſed. For ſo none ſhould have died in that land during the time of his three yeares pilgrimage through it, from his baptiſme to his death. Albeit hee cured many of diſeaſes naturall, yet not all that were naturally diſeaſed, though weake, or ſicke unto death. For he was not manifeſted to diſſolve or deſtroy the works of nature, albeit he gave profe by many experiments that he was able to deſtroy
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7892:54"/>
or divert the whole courſe of nature. But wee reade, <hi>That</hi> JESUS <hi>of</hi> NAZARETH <hi>being anointed by the Holy Ghoſt, went about from his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme to his death, doing good and healing all that were oppreſſed of the Deuill,</hi> Acts 10.38. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were ſo oppreſſed which were not poſſeſſed. Many diſeaſes, which to us would have ſeemed naturall or caſually bred, were as immediatly procured by Satan, as <hi>Iobs</hi> plagues were; and in theſe bonds of bodily affliction Satan had held them longer than he held <hi>Iob.</hi> Such was that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans diſeaſe, whoſe cure being wrought by the Phyſician of our ſoules upon the Sabbath day, the Ruler of the Synagogue did maligne as an ungodly work: but the Sonne of Gods reply doth juſtifie as well the truth of our aſſertion, as the lawfulneſſe of his practice. <hi>Hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the Sabbath day looſe his Oxe or his Aſſe from the ſtall, and leade him away to the water? and ought not this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, loe, eighteene yeares, be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from this bond on the Sabbath day?</hi> Luk. 13.14, 15. This bodily diſeaſe was a work of Satan, which the Sonne of God came to diſſolve. Satan had thus bound her to the end that hee might by theſe bonds draw her to ſome unlawfull practiſe for her eaſe; as to aſk counſell of ſome cunning woman, or to adventure upon the pretended my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of ſome unhallowed Art. Of diſeaſes meerely naturall, the cunning Tempter makes uſe or way by them for his temptations, though he have no finger in the inflicting of them; yet
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7892:54"/>
hee moveth ſuch as are grievouſly afflicted with them, to repine or murmure againſt God: and all ſuch repining, or impatiency in ſickneſſe, though occaſioned by ſickneſſe meerely naturall, is a work of Satan which the Sonne of God came to diſſolve or prevent. But how did hee diſſolve or prevent them, by taking them upon him? Though Satan could lay theſe and the like bonds of bodily afflictions upon this woman, and upon many others both men and women in Judea in theſe times; could he therefore lay the like upon the body of the Sonne of God? It is certaine he could not. How then did the Sonne of God in bodily maladies or grievances either parallel <hi>Iob,</hi> whom Satan had ſmitten, or thoſe miſerable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whom he looſed from Satans bonds? Hee did not parallel them at all in the matter of the diſeaſe, or bodily grievance; that could not breed in his body, it could not be produced in it by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: yet did hee parallel <hi>Iob,</hi> and all the parties whom he cured though ſmitten or bound by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, in the griefe or paine of the diſeaſe, whoſe matter could not faſten upon him. Hee which commands us by his Apoſtle, <hi>to weepe with them that weepe,</hi> did out of all queſtion exhibite a more reall paterne of this precept, than the Apoſtle could practice. Yet ſaith the Apoſtle of himſelfe, and he ſaid it without hypocriſie, without boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and I burne not</hi>? Such was his care of all the Churches, that every mans griefe was in ſome meaſure the Apoſtles griefe; every mans infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7892:55"/>
did in ſome portion weaken him: yet was it not foretold of this Apoſtle by any Prophet, <hi>that he ſhould beare our griefes, or take our infirmities upon him.</hi> This was the peculiar Character of the Sonne of God manifeſted in the fleſh, expreſly foretold by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Chap.</hi> 53. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. and the accompliſhment of it related by S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 16, 17. The maner of his curing others of their ſickneſſes and infirmities, was by taking them upon himſelfe, not in <hi>kinde,</hi> but by <hi>ſympathy.</hi> As the eye takes the forme or ſhapes of objects viſible without participation of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whence they flow: ſo our Saviour tooke the griefe or paine of every diſeaſe which he cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, without the matter or corruption which did breed griefe in the diſeaſed patient. In all mens griefes he was grieved; in all their paines he was tormented. Hee wept with thoſe that wept, and mourned with ſuch as mourned. Who did grone, and he was not troubled in ſpirit; who did ſigh, and hee was not ſad in heart? Hee tooke their ſighes and ſorrowes at a lower key, than they themſelves did, which had matter of affliction or ſorrow in them. Yet doe wee not reade that hee ſighed, groned, or often wept when hee cured others: but the reaſon was becauſe ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought his helpe, did not beſeech him with ſighes, with teares or grones. At the raiſing of <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead he wept and groaned: what was the reaſon? Not to prejudice the allegories and myſteries, which ſome ancient Fathers have hence obſerverd; the principall reaſon according
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7892:55"/>
to the literall ſenſe why at this time he wept, was becauſe <hi>Mary</hi> and her comforters came to him with weeping eyes. So ſaith the Text, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.13. <hi>When Ieſus ſaw her weepe, and the Iewes alſo weepe which came with her; hee groaned in the ſpirit, and was troubled in himſelfe and ſaid, Where have yee laid him? They ſaid unto him, Lord come and ſee: and Ieſus wept. Lazarus</hi> no doubt had ſighed and groaned in his abſence, had wiſhed his preſence with theſe, and other like expreſſions of ſorrow: and now that he finds <hi>Lazarus</hi> dead, and <hi>Maries</hi> cheeks for his deceaſe bedewed with teares, hee ſympathizeth with her in her preſent griefe, and by tuning his heart to <hi>Lazarus</hi> his dying pangs or throbs, he looſeth him from the bonds of death, and freeth <hi>Mary</hi> and her good friends from mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of griefe and ſorrow by taking her ſorrow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as the care of all the Churches which he had planted, was not the leaſt part of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> griefe and vexation: ſo the ſorrow which the Sonne of God did conceive for ſuch as would not ſeeke unto him for helpe, for ſuch as did not ſorrow for their ſinnes, was a great part of his ſufferings. Thus hee wept for Jeruſalem, whileſt Jeruſalem went mad with mirth, and reſolved to banquet al her gueſts at that great Paſſeover with his blood. <hi>When he was come neere, he beheld the Citie, and wept over it ſaying, If thou hadſt knowne, even thou, in this thy day the things which belong unto thy peace, but now are they hid from thine eyes,</hi> Luk. 19.42. Theſe teares were ſhed in publique for
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7892:56"/>
the City and Nation, but how many more hee ſhed in private, or with what ſighes hee deplored their eſtate, that would not implore his helpe, that would not feele their miſery, being bound by Satan as well in body, as ſoule; this I leave to the Readers conſideration and conjecture. Even when the full weight of bodily miſery did ſeize upon him, when he was bearing the Croſſe unto the place wherein hee was crucified, hee pitied Jeruſalem more than hee would ſuffer others to pitie him. <hi>Weepe not for mee yee daughters of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, but weepe for your ſelves.</hi> Thus hee did more than beare our griefs: for he was grieved at their miſeries, which did not grieve for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: <hi>Nihil miſerius miſero non miſerante ſeipſum.</hi> But in all theſe ſufferings by ſympathy, there was no violence, they were not mingled with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace or ſcorne. Albeit his cures were often ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Scribes and Phariſees, yet were they ſtill magnified by the parties cured, or by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But when his houre was come, the houre wherein hee was to enter combate with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of mankinde, hee was not one minute free from violence or indignity. The greateſt evills which can befall men in this mortall life, are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of body, indignities, or diſgrace: and it is diſputable whether a wiſe man would not rather chuſe death it ſelfe, than either lingring tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, perpetuall diſgrace, or a foule indignity. But wee need not diſpute this queſtion in the caſe of the Sonne of God: diſgrace and paine, indignities and torture, did not come ſingle up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7892:56"/>
him: one of them was anothers ſecond, whilſt the conflict betwixt the Serpent and the womans ſeed continued. As it is the property of ſome biting Serpents to make way or entrance by their venemous teeth for the infuſion of more deadly poiſon from ſome other parts of their body: ſo this generation of Vipers, which perſecuted the Sonne of God, uſed the civill power of <hi>Pilat,</hi> and the Roman ſouldiers to open his veines, and lance his fleſh, that their tongues might inſtill the poiſon of Aſpes into his glorious ſtripes, and bleeding wounds. But with the bitter taunts and indignities offered unto him, even whileſt he was upon the Croſſe, I am not to meddle in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: they have proper ſeaſons allotted for their memoriall. It ſufficeth therefore to obſerve, that the obedience and patience of the Sonne of God in theſe moſt grievous ſufferings were ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, that wee muſt borrow the patience of <hi>Iob,</hi> not in the ſecond temptation by bodily grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, but in his firſt temptation by loſſe of goods, or worldly ſubſtance, for a ſcale to ſet it forth. In all his ſufferings, in all that his enemies tongues or hands could doe, or ſay unto him, this ſervant of God did not ſinne ſo much as in word, but offered the ſacrifice of prayers and ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with the ſacrifice of his ſoule, and ſpirit for his perſecutors.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Yet admit <hi>Iobs</hi> patience in his bodily affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions had been more perfect than in the firſt temptation it was, for loſſe of bodily goods; and his obedience moſt compleat both without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7892:57"/>
of impatiencie, without ſtaine of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: the full meaſure of both had not been equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to the leaſt ſcantling of the obedience, or patience of the Sonne of God made man; for thoſe acts though otherwiſe equall, are alwayes beſt which are done <hi>ex officio.</hi> Prayers or ſolemn ſervices officiated by a Prieſt, and juſtice awar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a Magiſtrate, are more acceptable unto God, and more beneficiall unto men; than if the ſame Act or Offices were more accurately perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by private men without a calling. Now <hi>Iob,</hi> and other holy men became <hi>pro modulo,</hi> in ſome ſort the ſervants of God by obedience. It was the greater meaſure of their obedience, which made their ſervice more acceptable. But the obedience of the Sonne of God made man, did reſult or iſſue from the <hi>forme</hi> of a ſervant which hee voluntarily and on purpoſe tooke upon him, that hee might in it, and by it, performe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence more than ſufficient for diſſolving the force and ſtrength of that diſobedience and rebellion, which the Devill had wrought in the Father of mankinde, which with its curſe became heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his ſinfull poſterity. The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was created in the image of God, not in reſpect of holineſſe onely, but in reſpect of ſoveraignty and dominion. The ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> though he were the Son of God, was molded in the <hi>forme</hi> of a ſervant, even from his firſt conception. For as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith; he who was in the forme of God, did empty or annull himſelfe, taking upon him the <hi>forme</hi> of a ſervant. This was the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:7892:57"/>
the intrinſecall terme of the Sonne of Gods firſt humiliation; for as was ſaid before, the Sonne of God did not humble or empty himſelfe onely in his manhood, or according to his manhood, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was aſſumed; but in the very aſſumption of the manhood thus moulded in the forme of a ſervant. His humility as man was the humility of a ſervant, it was not affected but a native branch of his preſent calling. His obedience was not forced by conſtraint or feare, it was more than a branch, the very eſſence of his calling. For he tooke upon him the <hi>forme</hi> of a ſervant, it was not put upon him againſt his will, as it was upon <hi>Iob.</hi> Nor was his obedience as man more excellent than any other mans had been in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of its root or originall onely, as being the formall effect of his calling, that is of the forme of a ſervant which he tooke upon him, but moſt compleat in reſpect of the end or finall effect. For having annulled himſelf by taking upon him the forme of a ſervant, hee further humbled himſelfe and became obedient unto death, even to the death of the Croſſe. Other ſervants may with their earthly Maſters conſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be ſet free; and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authority may in ſome caſes command their Maſters to ſet them free. But the <hi>forme</hi> of a ſervant was ſo cloſely united, or wedded unto the Sonne of God manifeſted in the fleſh, that it could not bee cut off or divorced from him, ſave onely by death, and by the death of the Croſſe which was a ſervile death, and the accompliſhment of his ſervice. But in what peculiar acts was the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7892:58"/>
or exerciſe of the <hi>forme</hi> of a ſervant, which the Sonne of God tooke upon him, moſt conſpicuous or more remarkable, than they have been in other men?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is a great deale more uſuall to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our than to any Prophet, to any ſacred Writer, or other Meſſenger of Gods will, to tell his hearers that hee came not of himſelfe, but was ſent, that being ſent he came not to doe his owne will, but the will of him that ſent him; that hee ſpake nothing of himſelfe, but as his Father had appointed him, ſo he ſpake, and ſo he did. What was the reaſon, that hee <hi>that</hi> ſpake as never man ſpake, and did thoſe works which none beſides could doe, ſhould ſo often uſe theſe or like <hi>ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> to his Auditors. Sure, his ſpeeches unto this purpoſe are neither apologeticall, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive: as if his authority had been more que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable, or his practices more ſuſpitious, than the authority and practices of the Prophets, and other holy men had been. And what was it then that gave occaſion to this peculiar forme of ſpeech, or made the uſe of it ſo familiar and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent? All his ſpeeches to this purpoſe are but the characters or expreſſions of the <hi>forme</hi> of a ſervant, which hee tooke upon him. His whole courſe of life, his undertakings and encounters with this ſtubborne people, or with Satan and his inſtruments, might have teſtified to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate, unpartiall man, that no man being left free to himſelfe would have adventured upon them out of the deliberate choiſe of an humane
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7892:58"/>
or reaſonable will. Specially his laſt ſufferings were ſuch as no wiſe man, how godly ſoever, would have undergone, unleſſe they had been put upon him by authority ſupreme and irreſiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. We may further obſerve, how the forme of a man, and the forme of a ſervant, which had layed quiet for three and thirty yeares without any <hi>Criſis</hi> of their difference, did upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of his death and paſſion begin to ſtruggle, but without all ſtrife or hoſtile diſſention, as <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> towards the time of their birth had done in their mothers wombe: Even in the height of that triumphant and more than royall entertainment, which the multitude made him at his entrance into Jeruſalem, as if hee had then come to take poſſeſſion of the Crowne of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>David,</hi> even whileſt his eares were filled with theſe and the like acclamations, <hi>Hoſanna to the Sonne of David:</hi> He began to be troubled in ſpirit, whileſt the forme or nature of man did ſuggeſt one thing, and the forme of a ſervant correct what the forme of man did ſuggeſt, and ſway him another way. <hi>What ſhall I ſay? Father ſave me from this houre:</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ioh. 12.27.</note> So the reaſonable ſoule of man could not but wiſh, it could not but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend this houre as an houre of evill: and evill, as evill, cannot bee deſired by the will of man. Reaſon cannot but deſire or wiſh the prevention or removall of it. But though he were the Sonne of God, yet as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Hee learned obedience by the things which he ſuffered.</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 5.8.</note> Hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves not to doe according to his owne liking,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7892:59"/>
but as his Father ſhould appoint him. And hence hee inſtantly overballanced the former naturall deſire or inclination of the forme of man with the ſerious conſideration of his office or preſent calling, as he had taken upon him the forme of a ſervant. For as it were recalling himſelfe, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth; but <hi>therefore came I unto this houre,</hi> to wit, that hee might ſuffer all the evills incident to man in this world.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Afterwards, when his agony came upon him, his wonted naturall inclination of the forme of man, or ſway of the reaſonable ſoule became more ſtrong: and hence he puts his former wiſh or intimation, [Father, what ſhall I ſay? ſave me from this houre] into the forme of a prayer; <hi>Father, if it be poſsible let this cup paſſe from mee:</hi> and yet overſwaies this naturall inclination or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire as hee was man, with a ſtronger deſire or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to doe the office of a ſervant, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>checks that prayer which hee had conceived as man, with a prayer which hee had conceived <hi>ex officio,</hi> with a prayer of conſecration, <hi>neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe not as I will, but as thou willeſt:</hi> as if hee had ſaid, Though it bee juſt and reaſonable which I deſire; ſo juſt, as thou wouldeſt not deny the like to any other man in my caſe; yet ſeeing I am thy ſervant, and the Sonne of thy handmaid in ſuch a manner as no other man hath beene, I wholly ſubmit my ſelfe unto thy will, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate my ſelfe unto thy ſervice, how hard ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ſhall prove. <hi>Abraham,</hi> wee know, waxed bold with God by often reiterating and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7892:59"/>
the forme of his petition for Sodom. Firſt hee prayed that God would ſpare the Citie for fifty righteous men, then for forty, then for thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and laſtly deſcends to ten: His boldneſſe was grounded upon a dictate of nature or common principle of faith, that it was farre from him who was to doe juſtice to all the world, to ſlay the righteous with the wicked. Suppoſe, God had ſaid to <hi>Abraham</hi> at his firſt petition thus, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> at thy requeſt I will for this time ſpare the men of Sodom, upon condition that thou, and ſuch as ſupplicate for them will become their baile, and ſtand between them and that ſtorme of fire and brimſtone which muſt ſhortly goe out againſt them from my fiery preſence; would this hard condition have been accepted by <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> or accepted with patience? Would hee not have oppoſed this former principle with greater vehemencie and paſſion, [To ſlay the righteous for the wicked, that be farre from thee, O Lord: ſhall the Judge of all the world thus farre tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe the rule of juſtice?] Yet may we not think, that righteous <hi>Abraham,</hi> though inſtiled the friend of God, was ſo much leſſe ſinfull than the moſt ſinfull man in Sodom, as the man CHRIST JESUS was more righteous than <hi>Abraham.</hi> And what then could reſtraine this juſt and holy One for making the ſame plea for himſelfe, which <hi>Abraham</hi> for himſelfe might have made, which without offence unto his Lord, hee did often make on the behalfe of ſo many righteous men, not as were, but as he ſuppoſed poſſibly might be
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7892:60"/>
in Sodom? Onely this; the Sonne of God who is equall with God, to the end and purpoſe that hee might diſſolve the works which the Devill had wrought in our nature, had taken our nature upon him, had made his humane fleſh, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane blood, the fleſh and blood of God himſelfe, though not as parts of the Divine nature, yet as appurtenances of the Divine perſon, and was not onely found in the faſhion of man, but was inveſted with the eſſentiall forme of a ſervant. And it is the perfection of a ſervant, not to doe his owne will, but the will of his Lord. Now the body or humane nature of the Sonne of God was not a ſervant to his Divine perſon, but to the perſon of his Father, whoſe will hee was in the humane nature to performe, whatſoever the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it ſhould coſt him. For unto this purpoſe onely, and no other, did hee take both the nature of man and forme of a ſervant upon him, that hee might in them and by them accompliſh the will of his Father. As for his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>that,</hi> during the time of his humiliation, was in <hi>bonis patris</hi>; the goods and poſſeſſion of the Father; as every ſervant (properly ſo called) is the goods and inheritance of his Maſter. His ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings in this nature were to be <hi>extended</hi> untill the full price of our redemption was paid. The juſt meaſure of theſe his ſufferings, and full price of our redemption, he did (as he was man) learne by experience.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He undertakings of the Sonne of God for mans Redemption did for the moſt part conſiſt in his ſufferings. <hi>Though he were a Sonne</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.8.) <hi>yet learned he obedience by the things which hee ſuffered.</hi> Though he were alwayes a Sonne, the onely Son of God; yet ſuffer hee did not any longer than whileſt he was in the <hi>forme</hi> of a ſervant. Of all true ſervice or Apprentiſhip, obedience is the ſpeciall property: the greateſt perfection where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the condition of a ſervant, or one under legall command can pretend. Now the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of obedience cannot by any meanes either bee better exemplified or approved, than by patience in ſuffering. <hi>Servants</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18, 19, &amp;c.) <hi>be ſubject unto your Maſters with all feare; not onely to the good and gentle, but alſo to the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: For this is thanke worthy, if a man for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience toward God endure griefe, ſuffering wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. For what glory is it, if when yee bee buffeted for your faults, yee ſhall take it patiently? but if when you doe well and ſuffer for it, yee take it pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, this is acceptable with God. For even hereunto were yee called, becauſe Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us,

leaving us an example that yee ſhould follow his ſteps: who did no ſinne, neither was guile found in his mouth; who when hee was reviled, reviled not againe; when he ſuffered, he threatned not, but committed himſelfe to him that judgeth righteouſly: who his owne ſelfe bare our ſinnes in his owne body on the tree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. By this unſpeakeable obedience of the Son of God in vouchſafing to ſuffer for us, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable patience what hee had in no degree deſerved: wee who were by naturall condition ſlaves to Satan, were fully redeemed unto the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the ſonnes of God. Of what kinde ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his ſufferings were, ſuch and ſo many they were, and all ſo patiently ſuſtained by him, that hee made a full and perfect ſatisfaction for the ſinnes of the whole world, as the ancient and our Engliſh Liturgie expreſſeth. And that hee made a full and perfect ſatisfaction for all the ſinnes (whether of diſobedience or impatience in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings) of all thoſe men who are in any degree redeemed by him, is not queſtioned by any Chriſtian whether in truth or profeſſion onely, who grant that the Sonne of God did make any true and proper ſatisfaction for the ſonnes of men. Concerning the extent of mans redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Sonne of God, or for his full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their ſinnes, wee ſhall, if God give leave, diſcourſe hereafter. But whether unto this full and perfect ſatisfaction which hee undertook to make for men, if not univerſally (as our Church teacheth) yet as all reformed Churches agree, indefinitely taken: it were neceſſary, requiſite,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7892:61"/>
or expedient that the Sonne of God ſhould in our nature undergoe the ſame penalties or ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings in kinde, which without his ſatisfaction for them, all mankinde ſhould have ſuffered, is a queſtion which of late yeares hath troubled even thoſe reformed Churches, which agree upon this generall; that his ſatisfaction was moſt full and all-ſufficient. The heat of this contention is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this day rather abated, than extinguiſhed. Now the paines which all the ſonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe, without full ſatisfaction made by the Sonne of God, ſhould in juſtice have ſuffered, were the paines of Hell, perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all durance in that unquenchable fire, which was of old prepared for the Devill and his Angels. Whether this fire, be it materiall or immateriall, or more then equivalent perhaps unto materiall fire, did ſeize upon the humane ſoule or body of the Son of God, or upon both, either in his Agony in the garden, or upon the Croſſe, is the point or probleme now in queſtion. The affirmative part of this probleme hath been averred by ſome in their publike writings under the title of <hi>the Holy Cauſe</hi>; ſo dignified for no other reaſon, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, but becauſe it was in thoſe daies maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſtiffly by ſuch as deemed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than other men, at leaſt more Orthodoxall in points of ſacred doctrine than their Fathers in Chriſt, and (by confeſſion of their owne conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) more learned than themſelves. Others taking this for granted that Chriſt did ſuffer all the pains of the damned, have been ſo farre overſwaid with
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7892:62"/>
their adherence unto this doctrine, as to miſdeem that Article in the Apoſtles Creed concerning Chriſts deſcending into Hell, or <hi>ad inferos,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline this way; as if to beleeve Chriſt did deſcend into hell, had been all one, as if he had ſuffered the paines of hell in his Agony, in the garden or upon the croſſe. But if this had been any part of the true meaning of that Article; the Apoſtles, or whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever were the firſt Compoſers of the Apoſtolique Creed, as we now have it in the Latin, &amp; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Engliſh would haue expreſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves in plainer termes. For if by [Hell] in that Article the paines of Hell had been by them meant or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, they would not have ſaid that the Son of God deſcended into hell, but rather that hell had aſcended up unto him, whether in the garden or on the Croſſe. That the Son of God our Saviour Chriſt did truely deſcend into the nethermoſt Hell may with greater eaſe, and more probability bee proved out of the Canonicall Scriptures as well of the old Teſtament, as of the New; than his ſuffring the pains of hell, can be inferred from either Teſtament, or from the Apoſtles Creed. That Chriſt did after his death or diſſolution of body and ſoule deſcend into hell, ſuch as maintain his ſuffering the very paines of Hell, do generally deny. But to omit this incongruous paradox, or this prepoſterous expreſſion of it, that Chriſts deſcention into hell ſhould intimate his ſuffering of Hell-paine before his death, it ſhall ſuffice to examine the reaſons which have been or may be brought, that hee did or was to ſuffer ſuch paines
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7892:62"/>
whenſoever or in what place ſoever. All the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which can bee alledged that hee did ſuffer ſuch pains, muſt either be drawen from the event, or ſome experiments recorded in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or from ſome predictions in the Old, or from a neceſſity or expediencie whether in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, in equity, or out of his abundant love to mankinde, that he was to ſuffer them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. No neceſſity or expediency of ſuch ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings can bee (as I conceive) pretended, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ſatisfying Gods juſtice, or for his full and abſolute conqueſt over Satan, or for his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration to his everlaſting Prieſthood, that hee might bee a mercifull and faithfull high Prieſt in things concerning God, or a ſweet comforter of all ſuch as ſuffer whether in body or ſoule for his ſake. The <gap reason="foreign">

To begin then with the relation of his Agony. That is related at large by S. <hi>Matthew</hi> and S. <hi>Luke,</hi> which is ſcarce menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> whoſe ſpeciall part in penning this ſacred tragedie, it was to remember that divine diſcourſe with his Diſciples, being at his laſt Supper with them, and his repaire to the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den beyond Cedron, which he had ſo often fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented before, that the opportunity of this place made <hi>Iudas</hi> of a ſecret thiefe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an open Traytor.</p>

The temptation was grievous and more extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary then his former temptation in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Thus much is intimated by that perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory monition to his Apoſtles, [<hi>Pray that yee enter not into temptation:</hi>] partly from the maner of his prayer for himſelfe; <hi>Father if thou bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, remove this Cup from mee.</hi> The queſtion is what <hi>Cup</hi> this was, whoſe removall hee deſired? It was a deadly cup as all agree; but of what death? naturall, or ſupernaturall? death of body onely, or of ſoule? Had the <hi>Cup</hi> which he ſo fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to drinke, been onely a death naturall, or ſuch as other men had or may taſte of, his ſerious reiterated deprecation of it, would in ſome mens collections argue leſſe courage or reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in him than many others though generous, yet but meere men, have exhibited either at the approch or onſet of death, or in the very conflict with deadly pangs, or terrors. Or if <hi>Peter</hi> at this time
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7892:63"/>
had not been amazed with heavineſſe of ſpirit, hee might thus have crowed over his Maſter, <hi>dulce bellum inexpertis,</hi> when I forewarned you to bee good unto your ſelfe, and not to let theſe things come upon you; all the thanks I had for my paines was this, <hi>Get thee behinde mee Satan: for thou ſavoureſt not the things which are of God, but the things which bee of men.</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Matt. 16.22.</note> And yet now thou prayeſt unto thy Father that theſe things, which I adviſed thee to beware of, may not fall upon thee. Wherein then, I beſeech thee, did I offend, unleſſe it were in foreſeeing or foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that in time it would repent thee of thy forward reſolution? But admit this Cup whoſe removall hee now prayes for, were more than either the feare or feeling of a naturall death, though accompanied with more grievous ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes than any man before him had either felt or feared: was it poſſible that the horror of it ſhould not bee duely apprehended by him from the time, wherein he had reſolved to ſuffer thoſe things which <hi>Peter</hi> counſelled him not to ſuffer? If he were ignorant how dearely his future ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings would coſt him, why did hee undertake to make ſatisfaction for our ſinnes by them? For to undertake any buſineſſe of greater conſequence out of ignorance, or out of knowledge in part commendable, without due and conſtant reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; how ever the ſucceſſe fall out, doth alwaies prejudice, if not elevate the juſt eſteeme of the undertakers diſcretion. The undertaker in this great buſineſſe of mans Redemption, was the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7892:64"/>
Sonne of God, whoſe wiſdome no man can too highly eſtimate, whoſe undertaking for us all men beſides himſelfe doe eſteeme too low. Shall wee ſay then hee was not ignorant of any thing that ſhould befall him; yet ignorant of them as man, or that hee was ignorant of them in part, in part did foreknow them? Surely as hee was God, hee did know all things before they were, before they could have any title to actuall being. For infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite knowledge (ſuch is the knowledge of the Deity, and of every Perſon in it) can neither be ignorant or neſcient of any thing whether fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, preſent, or paſt, or of any thing poſſible to have been, or poſſible to be either for the preſent or future. If the leaſt degree of knowledge of any thing paſt, preſent, or future could accrue or reſult <hi>de novo</hi> unto the Divine nature, either in it ſelfe, or in any perſon in it, whether <hi>ab extra,</hi> from occurrences which happen in the revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of time, or from the ſuppoſed determination of his owne will from eternity; we ſhould hence be enforced to deny that the wiſdome or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Divine nature, or of any Perſon in it were abſolutely infinite. For that unto which any thing can accrue, or bee added is not truely infinite for the preſent, or in it ſelfe; can be no otherwiſe infinite than by ſucceſſion, or by addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſomewhat to it beſides it ſelfe. If it were true which ſome avouch, that God doth not, or rather cannot foreknow contingents future, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than by the determination of his owne will: this ſuppoſed determination of his will
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7892:64"/>
(being indeed but a fancy or transformation of his will to the ſimilitude of ours) doth make his knowledge abſolutely infinite, being of it ſelfe onely capable of true infinity, by this addition.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That God the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt, is of wiſdome and knowledge truely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite; not by occurrences <hi>ab extra,</hi> from the Creation, but in himſelfe, I firmely beleeve. As for the manner how hee doth know, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know things future, contingents eſpecially, is a point which I could wiſh were not at all or more ſparingly diſputed, as being aſſured, that this point of all others now queſtioned, cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be determined by any man or Angel, unleſſe he be every way as wiſe as God, or ſomewhat wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer. God (the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt) I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily beleeve did more perfectly know the degrees and qualities of all the ſuffrings of our Saviour in the fleſh, than he himſelf as man did either know or foreknow them. Yet did not the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or any Divine perſon, as Divine, know them by experience or painefull feeling as the man CHRIST JESUS did, but by a knowledge as ſupereminent to the knowledge of ſenſe or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſon, as the Divine nature is to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture humane: or as ubiquitary being or immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity is to circumſcriptive or locall preſence. The Divine nature, whether wee conſider it in the Perſon of the Father, Sonne, or Holy Ghoſt, could learne nothing which they knew not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by the ſufferings of the Sonne: yet the Son himſelfe as man did learne obedience by the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7892:65"/>
things which hee ſuffered in the fleſh. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be thought or ſaid of other knowledge communicated to the man CHRIST JESUS by the vertue of the Perſonall union: yet his ſenſible or experimentall knowledge, as of pains and ſorrow whether incident to body onely, or to both body and ſoule, was not from his cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle infinite, was not ſo compleat at his baptiſme, as at his laſt Supper, nor then ſo exact as in the garden, or upon the Croſſe it was. A growth or increaſe in this kinde of knowledge is granted by ſuch of the Schoolemen, as did not know or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what it was for the Sonne of God to be in the forme of a ſervant, but tooke this to bee all one, as to bee in the forme of a mortall man. But ſuch as duely conſider his peculiar eſtate or condition, whileſt he was in the forme of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, will eaſily conceive his voluntary renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that full meaſure of knowledge which hee now hath as man, and his obedient ſubmiſſion of his manhood unto the feeling of our infirmities, to haue been a neceſſary part, or rather the very depth of that humiliation, or exaninition of himſelfe, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeakes. For it is one ſpeciall good quality of a ſervant, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to know his errand, not to be too inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive after the particular contents of it, before hee be ſent; but to expect inſtructions from him that ſent him, though it be in an Ambaſſage.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If wee take it then as granted, that our Saviour as man did from his infancy moſt clearly foreſee, or diſtinctly know, that hee was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7892:65"/>
mankinde, by taſting the bitter cup of death for them; it will not hence follow, that he ſhould at all times know, either the true quality, or exact meaſure of the paines which hee was at the time appointed by his Father to ſuffer, for accompliſhing this great worke undertaken by him. For of all things that can bee knowen by men, the knowledge of paines either for quality, or the diſtinct meaſure of them, is leaſt poſſible without experimentall knowledge, or ſenſible feeling of them. Many Phyſicians haue learnedly diſcourſt of the ſeverall ſorts of feavers, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated their degrees <hi>more mathematico,</hi> as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians doe the quantity of figures or ſolid bodies, or revolutions of the Heavens. But the reall paines or languiſhments of hecticall, peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiall, or other feavers, the moſt learned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician in the world cannot diſtinctly know or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate, unleſſe hee feele them. Or in caſe by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible experience he knew the nature or quality, or ſeverall degrees of every feaver; he is not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by enabled diſtinctly to apprehend the maladies which attend the Gout untill he feele them. Or ſuppoſe he knew theſe maladies from the higheſt to the loweſt degree, this will not indoctrinate him to know the extremities of the Stone ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly and diſtinctly as his meaneſt Patient doth which hath ſenſible experience of it, though in a middle degree. Our Saviour long before his laſt reſort unto the garden of <hi>Gethſemane,</hi> was a man of ſorows, had plentifull experience of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane infirmities or bodily maladies. For he had
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7892:66"/>
felt the griefe and paine of all the diſeaſes which he had cured by moſt exact and perfect ſympathy with the diſeaſed. His heart was tunable to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans heart, that did ſeriouſly impart his griefe of minde or affliction of body unto him. Onely in laughter or bodily mirth hee held no conſort for ought we reade with any man. But the griefe and ſorow which in the garden he ſuffered, could not be knowen by ſympathy. The protopathy was in himſelfe, and no man, not the Apoſtles themſelves could ſo truely ſympathize with him in this griefe, as he had done with them, or the meaneſt of their brethren in other grievances or afflictions. For never was there on earth any ſorow like unto the ſorow, wherewith the Lord had afflicted him in this day of his wrath. Yet was his obedience more than equall to his ſorow, and this obedience he learned by his ſufferings.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But if in this houre, or any other hee lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned obedience, this ſeemes to argue that he was either diſobedient before, or at leſt wanted ſome degree or part of obedience. For no man can be ſaid to learne that leſſon, which he hath already moſt perfectly by heart. To this wee ſay, That how ever the Sonne of God, or the man Chriſt Jeſus, did never want any degree or part of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituall or implanted obedience; yet the meaſure of his actuall obedience was not at all times the ſame. The obedience which the Apoſtle ſaith hee learned, was obedience paſſive; and all paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience doth properly conſiſt in patient ſuffering ſuch things as are enjoyned by lawfull
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7892:66"/>
authority, or in ſubmitting our wills and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not our bodies onely unto the juſt deſignes of Superiours. Our Saviour at all times wholly ſubmitted his humane will unto his Fathers will, had alwayes undertaken with alacrity whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his Father had appointed him to undertake or undergoe: but his Father had never called him to ſuch hard ſervice as in this houre was put upon him. Now if obedience paſſive conſiſt in patience of ſuffering, it muſt needs increaſe, as the hardneſſe of the ſufferings increaſe; in caſe the hardeſt ſervice bee borne with equall pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or undertaken with the ſame meaſure of ſubmiſſion unto his will which enjoines them, that meaner ſervices are. Againe, if the true meaſure of bodily paines or ſorow of minde can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwiſe be knowen than by experience, the Sonne of God himſelfe as man, and in the forme of a ſervant, was to learne obedience, at leſt ſome new degrees of it by gaining experience of unuſuall paines and ſufferings. And ſuch queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe were thoſe anguiſhes, whether of ſoule or body which he ſuffered in the garden. That hee had often prayed before this time, wee reade; and no doubt had alwayes tendred his petitions to God as to his Father with ſuch humility of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as became an obedient Sonne, and faithfull ſervant, as did beſt befit the Ideall paterne of all true obedience. But we doe not reade, nor have wee any occaſion or hint, to conjecture, that at any time before this hee did ſo humble himſelfe in prayer, as at this time he did, whether we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7892:67"/>
the forme or tenour of his ſupplications, or his voice or bodily geſture in the delivery of them. All the circumſtances of theſe his ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, are accurately recorded by the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts. <hi>He was withdrawen, or did withdraw himſelfe, from his Apoſtles about a ſtones caſt.</hi> And yet in this diſtance his Apoſtles though drouſie and heavie, did heare him pray diſtinctly, who had taught them and us to pray for our ſelves in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, ſo ſecretly as that none beſides our heavenly Father might heare them. As for his geſture or poſture of body, that, at the firſt delivery of his prayer and ſupplications was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. So S. <hi>Luke Cap.</hi> 22. <hi>ver.</hi> 41. <hi>Hee went forward,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Mark, a little and fell on the ground and prayed, Mark.</hi> 14.35. So hee might doe and fall on his knees as S. <hi>Luke</hi> relates. But S. <hi>Matthew</hi> addes, <hi>he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, ſaying, O my Father if it bee poſsible let this cup paſſe from me.</hi> That he thrice uſed this forme or tenour of prayer, whether at each time hee uſed the ſame poſture of bodie, or rather falling on his knees than on his face; is not ſo cleare though moſt probably hee did ſo. Now that which theſe three Evangeliſts doe intimate or imply in the accurate relations of theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, is more expreſly recorded by S. <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 5.7. to wit, that in the dayes of his fleſh hee offered up prayers and ſupplications with ſtrong crying and teares. And no wonder if ſtreames of teares guſhed from his eyes, when his whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (as S. <hi>Luke</hi> informes us) did diſtill blood. The
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7892:67"/>
full importance of this ſacred paſſage of S. <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 5. from the fourth <hi>verſe</hi> to the ninth, ſeeing it containes matter of deeper myſteries than moſt Interpreters (which I have read) have taken any great paines to <hi>ſound,</hi> muſt be part of the ſubject of another following Treatiſe, concerning his conſecration to his everlaſting Prieſthood. Thus much in the meane time I take as granted that the forecited ſeventh <hi>verſe</hi> of the fifth <hi>Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> doth in ſpeciall referre unto the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications made by our Saviour in his Agonie: and will be the beſt Comment I know upon the Evangeliſts, for clearing that point now in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion [what Cup it was, for whoſe removall hee thrice ſo earneſtly prayed.]</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Hee offered up theſe his prayers,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>unto him who was able to ſave him from death.</hi> This is exactly parallel to the preamble which our Saviour uſed before the full ingruence or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſme of his Agony; <hi>Abba, Father, all things are poſsible to thee, take away this Cup from mee, &amp;c.</hi> No man doubts but that his Father was able to ſave him from diſſolution of body and ſoule, that is, from death it ſelfe, whether it had come by courſe of nature, or by violence. But from this death it is plaine he did not ſave him. Of this cup or kinde of death he taſted to the full, in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extremity, upon the Croſſe. How then is it true which S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the forecited place ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>that after hee offered up prayers with ſtrong crying and teares, hee was heard in that hee feared: Or</hi> (as others reade) <hi>for his piety.</hi> Whether rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                     </gap> is thus much at leaſt, that <hi>hee was delivered</hi> from that which hee ſo much feared, though with a pious feare: for out of ſuch a feare hee offered up his prayers with ſtrong crying and teares. The <hi>Cup</hi> then which hee ſo earneſtly prayed might paſſe from him, was not the cup of violent death ſimply conſidered, nor as accompanied with all the indignities done unto him by the Jewes, Romanes, and others the very next day. For what then did hee at this time ſo earneſtly pray? for ſpeedy releaſe or deliverance from the heavineſſe of ſoule, or anguiſh of ſpirit, which now had ſuddenly ſeized upon him. The very firſt draught of this Cup had caſt him into a bloody ſweat, and had hee been enforced to have taken a ſecond, or third deepe draught of it; or if his preſent anguiſh had been for ſome few houres continued, hee had prevented the cruell tortures of the Croſſe, and the indignities done unto his perſon by the Jews or Roman Souldiers. This was that Cup which <hi>Peter</hi> counſelled him not to taſte of, for whoſe removall hee never prayed, as being fully reſolved to pledge the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extremity of their malice, with a farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meaſure of patience. And for this reaſon when <hi>Peter</hi> drew his ſword for his reſcous (as he intended) he checks him againe, as he had done, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.23. <hi>Put up thy ſword into the ſheath: the Cup which my Father gives mee, ſhall I not drink it? Ioh.</hi> 18.11. But that cup which he ſo earneſtly
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7892:68"/>
did pray might paſſe from him, did certainely vaniſh with his Agony, and his Agony did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure no longer than he offered up his ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and prayers; about the ſpace of an houre. There remained no ſigne or ſymptome of it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Traitor had delivered him up into his enemies hands. Or if wee ponderate S. <hi>Lukes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his Agony aright, his prayers were heard upon the firſt, or ſecond uttering of them. Seeing eaſe, or deliverance from the ingruence of paines, is all that they preſſed for the preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: it is all one whether the burthen bee leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or his ſtrength to beare it be increaſed. His eaſe and comfort is either way the ſame. Admit then the heavy burthen laid upon the Sonne of God in the dayes of his fleſh, had continued the ſame or perhaps increaſed from his firſt entring into the garden: yet his prayers were heard in that an Angel was ſent, whether to ſtrengthen him or to comfort him, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.43. The word in the Originall is often uſed for ſuch internall ſtrength, as men recover by ſome comfortable refection, when they are faint for want of meat, or by gathering their ſpirits after they have been diſſipated or dejected by ſudden feare or amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It would perhaps be accompted imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to make inquiry what Angell it was, which was ſent to comfort or ſtrengthen the Sonne of God in that extremity of his Agony. Yet many of the Ancients, and of moderne Interpreters not a few, are of opinion that it was the ſame Angel which did annunciate his birth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7892:69"/>
and that was the Angel <hi>Gabriel.</hi> Who though perhaps hee did not take his name from his foreſeene deputation to his function; yet did hee never brook it better in any former acts of his miniſtery, then in the performance of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſervice. His name imports as much as the ſtrength of God, and at this time hee ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the man CHRIST JESUS who then was, and now is the Sonne of God: as truely God as man. Now if he who was the Sonne of God, did receive ſtrength or comfort from an Angel; it is no paradox or ſoloeciſme to ſay, that hee learned obedience by the things which he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or that theſe preſent ſufferings were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen to him as man, untill he felt them. For no reaſon can be to my apprehenſion conceived, why hee who was the Sonne of God might not be capable of ſome growth in knowledge, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentall eſpecially, as well as in bodily quantity or ſtrength of body. Concerning the nature and quality of thoſe ſufferings wherein hee was ſtrengthened or comforted by an Angel, as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were naturall or ſupernaturall; or if ſupernaturall, whether they were the very paines of Hell, or ſuch as wee ſhould have ſuffered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his ſatisfaction, cannot be inferred either from the unuſuall forme of his prayers uttered with ſtrong cries, or from his geſture in the garden.</p>

Our Saviour (no doubt) as man, had
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7892:70"/>
a more full apprehenſion of all the malicious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces and cruel indignities which his enemies could put upon him, than this Captaine had. The meaſure of his bodily ſufferings and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall wrongs were in number farre more, and for quality farre more grievous than ever were intended to this Captaine, or to any other mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man by their enemies. And though the death of the Croſſe was in it ſelfe an ignominious and cruell death, yet in our Saviours particular that was moſt true, <hi>mortis modus morte pejor</hi>; the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his apprehenſion, of his double arraigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conviction, of his uſage before he was brought to the place of execution, and all the time whilſt the malice of Jew and Gentile was wrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon him was more grieuous then the death of the Croſſe it ſelfe without theſe grievous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants could have been. To ſcan theſe briefly, and in order. The very manner of his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion made ſome impreſſion of ſorow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation in him, as appeares by the character of his ſpeech, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.32, &amp;c <hi>Then Ieſus ſaid to the chife Prieſts and Captaines of the Temple, and the Elders which were come to him, Be yee come out, as againſt a thiefe, with ſwords and ſtaves? when I was dayly with you in the Temple, yee ſtretched forth no hand againſt me, but this is your houre, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo no queſtion did their binding of him in bonds by all probability and circumſtances more grievous and more diſgracefull, than ordinary felons, theeves, or murtherers, in thoſe dayes were lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto, eſpecially before legall conviction. For
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7892:70"/>
                     <hi>Iudas</hi> who had bargained with the high Prieſts and Elders for making delivery of him into their hands, had forewarned them, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.48. <hi>Lead him away ſafely</hi>; as if hee had ſaid, Bee ſure yee make him faſt. Whether the Traytor thus ſpake out of a deſire to have him put to death, or onely to ſecure himſelfe againſt all quirks of Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his bargaine in caſe JESUS (as hee oft had done) ſhould eſcape out of their hands, I will not peremptorily determine: albeit I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that divers of the exquiſiteſt Interpreters, and other good writers are of opinion, that <hi>Iudas</hi> betrayed him, not ſo much out of malice, as out of covetouſneſſe: being perſwaded hee was able to quit himſelfe from any reſtraint, that they could lay upon him. In the meane time, however it fared with his Maſter, or with them to whom he delivered him; hee reſolved to free his gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bargaine from further queſtion. And this may be the probable reaſon of his relentance af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he ſaw his Maſter condemned to death, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all hope of reſkue or reprivall. So it often falls out, that when the events fall out worſe than the Projectors intended, albeit their firſt intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were in themſelves wicked, the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hereof brings them commonly to ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, as cauſeth deſpaire ſooner than any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of true repentance. And for <hi>Iudas</hi> to make his gaine, or to redeeme the loſſe which hee had ſuffered by the waſt of ointment as hee inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted it, powred upon his head, by the delivery of his Maſter, although hee did not at all intend
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7892:71"/>
his death; was an odious treaſon, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the proper fruit of a baſe and covetous minde. And both branch and fruit, the covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the treaſon might be a corraſive to our Saviour, and in part occaſion his Agony. So might the malicious diſpoſition, and ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous proceeding of the Prieſts and Elders againſt him, be more grievous to him than the paines of death or publique diſgraces which he ſuffered by them. The ſuborning of falſe witneſſes againſt him were more diſtaſtfull to his righteous ſoule, than all the ſufferings and ſcornfull revilings which they beſtowed upon him. But amongſt all the indignities which Satan, and his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments could invent, theſe were the moſt grievous. Firſt their begging of <hi>Barabbas</hi> his pardon, when <hi>Pilate</hi> would have diſmiſt or reprived JESUS. This was a cruell kinde of mercy, the true effect of prepoſterous zeale, and Phariſaicall hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. For this cuſtome of ſhewing mercy, or beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging pardon for ſome priſoner at the great Feaſt of the Paſſeover was firſt inſtituted in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the mercy which God had ſhewed unto their Fathers in delivering them out of Ae<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gypt. And in requitall of this extraordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, which the Lord God of Iſrael had ſhewed to their Fathers, they deliver him to be crucified by the Gentiles, being ſet up by <hi>Pilate</hi> an heathen Governour in competition for this poore favour with <hi>Barabbas,</hi> a notable rebell, thiefe, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer. Another indignity was the ſudden execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this moſt unjuſt ſentence, not giving him
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7892:71"/>
ſuch competent time as other priſoners had to diſpoſe of himſelfe, and of his eſtate, or to make preparation for death. For this Seſſion was not called for him but for others who had been in cuſtody before, yet he is caſt into the bargaine as a fragment or refuſed remnant, as a party no more conſiderable than a Cutpurſe taken in the maner in open Court whileſt others are arraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Now all theſe indignities and many more, as the Evangeliſts tell us CHRIST did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee before his Agony ſeized upon him. And might not the foreſight or due apprehenſion of them, and of the lingring death which theſe did uſher in, or both put together, more probably cauſe that Agony and ſweat in the garden, then the apprehenſion of death and indignities ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, or then the extremity of ſome diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes doe the like effects in other men?</p>
                  <p n="10">10. As for the ſweating of blood in ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, that is never occaſioned by any apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the diſeaſe occurrent, but onely by the <hi>ingruence</hi> of the diſeaſe it ſelfe, whereof it is an effect or ſymptome. Or if it bee objected that our Saviour might have a deeper apprehenſion of his death approaching, than any other man had of diſeaſes before they did actually ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. Yet is there no reaſon to ſuſpect, that he had not the ſame apprehenſion long before he entred into the garden, or that this apprehenſion whether of death or indignities, ſhould not bee improved by ſenſible experiments of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences after done unto him in the high Prieſts
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7892:72"/>
hall, by the Roman Souldiers, or by his ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging at <hi>Pilates</hi> command which was more cruell than others condemned to die the death of the Croſſe did ſuffer; becauſe <hi>Pilate</hi> hoped that the ſight of his gory ſtripes might quench the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious heat of the Jews, and acquit him from fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condemnation. Yet in all his enſuing ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings we doe not reade or finde that hee had any ſymptomes of that anguiſh which came upon him in the garden: Hee did not ſo much as pray unto his Father for any releaſe from the tortures and indignities, which he actually felt by ſenſible experience; but rather for his enemies which had procured them. Or if his bloody ſweat in the garden had been occaſioned (as in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility it was not) from any foreſight or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of his indigne uſage by the Jews, and by the Roman Souldiers, whileſt he was in hold or upon the Croſſe; it could not bee any ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of helliſh or infernall paines.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Yet that he ſuffered ſuch paines upon the Croſſe hath been avouched too confidently by ſome, and more peeviſhly maintained by others. One eſpeciall ground pretended for this ill ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding doctrine is, that exclamation uttered by him a little before his death; <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> The collections which many learned writers of the Romiſh Church have drawen from <hi>Calvins</hi> Comments upon theſe words, are too plentifull to be here inſerted; and the imputations which they lay upon him and his followers unanſwerable, if he meant or ſpake
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7892:72"/>
as they expreſſe his meaning, to wit, that theſe words ſhould argue a ſenſible experience of Hell paines, or the worſt ſymptomes of ſuch paines, as either deſpaire, diſtraction of minde, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content. I ſhould be very ſory to reade them in <hi>Calvin,</hi> or in any other writer of the reformed Churches, very unwilling diſtinctly to call to memory ſome paſſages in late Engliſh Writers which to my remembrance incline too much this way. All I can ſay in <hi>Calvins</hi> defenſe, if hee pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily affirme, that our Saviour did ſuffer the paines of Hell upon the Croſſe, is this. If it be an hereſie (as the Romiſh Church doth make it, and I cannot gaineſay them, if it bee ſtifly maintained:) the hereſie was broached by a great and learned Romiſh <note n="*" place="margin">Cuſanus.</note> Cardinall before <hi>Calvin</hi> wrote. And when the Pope, who is the pretended Judge of all hereſies, ſhall condemne his books for hereticall, or his opinion in this particular for an hereſie; I ſhall be ready to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Church of England (as farre as I am able) to doe the like. The true importance of our Saviours exclamation or proclamation rather upon the Croſſe (for hee uttered it, <hi>voce magna,</hi> with a proclamatory voice,) will come to bee ſcanned in the next Treatiſe. But if Satan either by his owne ſtrength, or by ſpeciall permiſſion from God the Father, did tempt our Saviour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſſe, whether immediatly or mediatly by the malicious ſtratagems of the Jews, and by the prophaneſſe of the Roman Souldiers ſo farre as to proclaime his owne deſpaire or diffidence
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7892:73"/>
of Gods favour towards him, or to the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of impatience or diſcontent; it would bee hard to make any conſtruction of our Saviours prediction, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.30. <hi>The Prince of this world commeth, and hath nothing in me</hi>; or as ſome have more fully expreſt the Hebraiſme, <hi>nothing againſt mee.</hi> As certainly he had no matter to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no occaſion of ſolace either to himſelfe or to his infernall aſſociats, as if they had moved him to the leaſt degree of diffidence or impatience. For our Saviour queſtionleſſe was more then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by a more excellent certainty, than the certainty of faith, that he ſhould be ſaved from the ſecond death; that he ſhould never fall away from Gods favour, nor be for a moment forſaken of him. Otherwiſe, he had been a leſſe faithfull ſervant of God, leſſe mindfull of ſpeciall reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations made to him as man, then they are who beleeve their owne ſpeciall election or predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, onely upon application of Gods generall promiſes to themſelves in particular. For beſides the internall revelations made to him as man, he had many publique aſſurances, ſuch as others beſides himſelfe did heare; none of which hee did ever diſtruſt or doubt: much leſſe could hee feare leſt his Father ſhould be ſo farre diſpleaſed with him, as ever to forſake him. Now his pains upon the Croſſe were grievous, and the indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties done unto him, to fleſh and blood intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: yet his apprehenſion of celeſtiall joyes due unto him, was never interrupted. And out of this never interrupted apprehenſion, or rather
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7892:73"/>
view of theſe joyes, <hi>hee endured the Croſſe, and deſpiſed the ſhame,</hi> as our Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.2. Not onely his apprehenſion of theſe, but his moſt circumſpect obſervance of all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to doe his Fathers will, and to ſee all the Scriptures concerning him fulfilled; was neuer more conſpicuouſly remarkable, whileſt hee was upon the Croſſe, than in his laſt conflict with death. The fulfilling of the Prophecies concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his ſufferings, requires a peculiar Treatiſe. For his extraordinary circumſpection about that very point of time wherein hee uttered theſe words, <hi>Eli, Eli, lamaſabacthani, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> that is abundantly te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by S. <hi>Iohn</hi> who was an eare witneſſe of his ſpeeches. <hi>Now there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus his mother, and his mothers ſiſter, Mary the wife of Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas and Mary Magdalene: When Ieſus therefore ſaw his mother, and the Diſciple ſtanding by whom hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; hee ſaith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy Sonne. Then ſaith he to the Diſciple, Behold thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And from that houre that Diſciple took her unto his owne home,</hi> Joh. 19.25, 26, 27.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ut however the former pretended concluſion concerning Chriſts ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the paines of Hell, or any of their ſymptomes, cannot bee inferred either from his bloody ſweat in the garden, or from any ſpeeches of his or any effect related by the Evangeliſts: yet the favourers of this concluſion rather than they would give it over endeavour to prove it by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon drawen from the finall cauſe of all his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. The ſuffering of the paines of hell (ſay they) was neceſſarily required to the full ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for all our ſinnes, which all good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans confeſſe hee did beare both in his Agony and upon the Croſſe. But the very foundation of this aſſertion is very weak, and the ſuperſtructive worſe: moſt derogatory to the infinite worth of Chriſts bloody Sacrifice. Firſt, it is not required by the rules of equity, whether Divine or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, that ſatisfaction for wrongs done ſhould alwayes be made in kinde, or by way of counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. It is in many caſes more full and more ſufficient when it is made by equivalencie, than if it were made in kinde. As in caſe a man in his rage ſhould cruelly beate his neighbour, or but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7892:74"/>
his cattell: to permit the party which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the wrong whether in his perſon or in his goods, to exerciſe the like rage or cruelty upon his perſon or live-goods, which did the wrong, could be no true ſatisfaction either to the law, or party wronged, but rather beaſtly revenge. The beſt ſatisfaction which in this caſe could be awar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the party wronged, would be to give him ſuch contentment in one kinde or other, as might in reaſon, though not to paſſion, be as beneficiall and uſefull to him, as the effects of his fury and rage which did the wrong, were in juſt eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hurtfull: and yet ſuch withall, as ſhould make the offender, as unwilling to doe the like wrong againe, as the party wronged or any in his caſe would be to ſuffer it. This is the onely true ſatisfaction which in the ſame or like caſe could be juſtly made to the Law, whoſe true intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alwayes is to make all men willing to doe to others, as they deſire ſhould bee done unto them: unwilling to doe any thing to others, which they would not have done unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Our father <hi>Adam</hi> had wronged our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nature, and all of us had offended our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor more grievouſly, than any man can wrong another. Now in that our God and Creator is withall the eternall rule of juſtice, or rather Juſtice it ſelfe; it was requiſite that ſatisfaction ſhould bee made unto him in the fulleſt degree. For one man, for all men which had done this wrong, to make ſatisfaction to infinite Majeſtie either in whole or in part was impoſſible. Though
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7892:75"/>
all mankinde had been condemned to ſuffer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly both in body and ſoule, they might by this meanes have been continually making ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, but never have made it; albeit their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings had been endleſſe. Therefore was this great work undertaken by the Son of God made man for us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Suppoſe then all this had been foreknown, before our Saviour was incarnate, ever ſince the fall of our firſt Parents, and the ſentence denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt them; it would have been a more grievous ſinne in our firſt Parents or in any of their poſterity, than the ſinne of the old Serpent in ſeducing them or us to yeeld to his ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to have beſought God the Father, that his onely Sonne ſhould make ſatisfaction for us in the very ſame kind, which we ſhould have made, but could never make, that is, by ſuffering the paines of Hell. That the man Chriſt Jeſus might ſuffer ſuch paines as the damned ſhall doe, was perhaps the deſire of Satan, that which the great Enemy of mankinde did moſt earneſtly labour to effect. And if thus he did but deſire, this was the greateſt actuall ſinne, which either hee or his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall aſſociats ever had committed, or can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. Whatſoever they might deſire, all that our heavenly Father could require of his onely Sonne after hee became our ſurety, was to make full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for all our ſinnes againſt his Deity, or the eternall rule of juſtice. But all this he knew might bee accompliſhed by his onely Sonne after a more excellent maner, than either by exerciſing
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7892:75"/>
his wrath due unto us, or by ſuffering Satan whoſe redemption his Sonne did no way under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, to wreake the utmoſt of his malice or foehood againſt mankinde upon him. For my ſelfe amongſt others, I muſt confeſſe, I could never underſtand the language of many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Divines, who would perſwade us that the full vialls of Gods wrath due unto our ſinnes were powred upon his Sonne. Whatſoever their meaning be, which I preſume is much better, than I can gather from their expreſſions, the maner of ſpeech (to ſay no worſe) is very improper, and to me unpleaſant. For how was it poſſible, God the Father ſhould bee wroth with him in whom alone he was alwayes well pleaſed. But wrath or anger againſt any one, are alwayes the effects of ſome diſpleaſure precedent: and no ſatisfaction can be made whileſt diſpleaſure is taken, or wrath kindled againſt the party which ſeeks to make ſatisfaction or reconciliation. Now the inflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or permiſſion of Hell paines to bee inflicted upon any, is the award not of Gods judgement, but of his wrath and fury.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If it be objected that our ſinnes were infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, though not for number yet for quality, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe committed againſt an infinite Majeſtie; and conſequently that no ſatisfaction according to the exact rule of juſtice could bee made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out puniſhment, or penalties truely infinite: the anſwere is as Orthodoxall, as eaſie or common, That the ſatisfaction made for us by the Sonne of God, was more truely infinite, than the ſinnes

of mankind were. For it was abſolutely infinite. <hi>Non quia paſſus eſt infinita, ſed quia qui paſſus eſt erat infinitus.</hi> The perſon or party who made ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for us, or party which undertooke the ſatisfaction, was both in Majeſty, and in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as truely infinite, as the Majeſty and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe whom we had offended, and by whom exact ſatisfaction was required: both of them were both wayes abſolutely infinite. J omit the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſuch calculatory arguments, as this; [Our ſinnes were abſolutely infinite, becauſe committed againſt an infinite Majeſty,] as too well knowen to moſt ſtudents, and often enough, if not too often deciphered in other of my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations. For this being admitted, all ſinnes ſhould bee equall, becauſe all are committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſame infinite Majeſty and goodneſſe. As for the true meaſure of our ſinnes and ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervings, that muſt be taken from the meaſure of Gods diſpleaſure againſt them: and that is but equall to the ſeverall degrees of our diſobedience to his moſt holy Lawes and Commandements. This then we verily beleeve, that the full height and meaſure of all diſobedience and rebellions againſt God, was neither higher or greater than the obedience which his Sonne performed in our fleſh, or whileſt hee ſtood in the condition of a ſervant: that our heavenly Father was never ſo much diſpleaſed at all our diſobediences, as hee was well pleaſed with the obedience of his onely Sonne, or with their obedience that are truely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed in him, and are made partakers of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7892:76"/>
in his ſufferings. Both parts of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion may with facility be evinced in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all men which have ſubſcribed unto, or doe admit the principles in Divinity, whether Legall or Evangelicall.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It was a maxime undoubted in the time of the Law, that obedience was better than ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: the corrollary or conſequence of which maxime doth amount to this point, that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence without ſacrifice, was alwayes better than ſacrifice without obedience. Yet ſuch ſacrifices, as were appointed by God, being offered out of the ſpirit of obedience, were alwayes more acceptable than obedience alone. Such ſacrifices as were appointed by God himſelfe, unleſſe they were offered in obedience and out of conformity to his Law, were abominable. The principall part of obedience, which the Law required, was the humble confeſſion of the parties ſinnes, for whoſe ſakes they were offered. This confeſſion was made over the heads of the beaſts which were offered: the parties offering them alwayes acknowledging either expreſly by their tongues, or implicitly in heart, that they had better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a cruell death than the dumbe creatures, which they ſacrificed had done. Briefly, Legall ſacrifices were then acceptable, when their offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers put on ſuch affections, as <hi>David</hi> maketh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of, when he ſaw the people plagued for his ſinnes, or at leſt when the puniſhment of their owne ſinnes came ſuddenly upon them through his folly. <hi>Loe, I have ſinned, and I have done
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7892:77"/>
wickedly: but theſe ſheepe what have they done?</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">2. Sam. 24.17.</note> Yet even whileſt the beſt of Gods people thus affected did offer the beſt kinde of Legall Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices (bullocks whilſt their hornes and hoofes began to ſpread,) their ſacrifice and obedience did but lovingly meet, they were not mutually wedded or betrothed. But whileſt the Sonne of God did offer up himſelfe for us upon the Croſſe, his ſacrifice and obedience were more ſtrictly united, than man and wife, than mans ſoule and body. For betwixt theſe there is oft times diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or reluctance: ſo was there never betwixt Chriſts Divine perſon who was the offerer, and the humane nature which was the offering. His humane nature and will before it was ſacrificed, and whilſt it was ſacrificed, was more obedient to his Fathers will, than our firſt Parents ſenſes or affections in their integrity were unto their reaſonable ſoules. When hee commeth into the world (as our Apoſtle interprets the <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 40. Heb. 10.5, 6, 7.</note> Pſalmiſt) he ſaith, <hi>Sacrifice and offerings thou wouldeſt not, but a body haſt thou prepared or fitted for mee. In burnt offerings and ſacrifices for ſinne thou hadſt no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: then ſaid I, loe, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to doe thy will O God.</hi> This will of God accompliſhed through the ſacrifice of his Sonne, was that will of God, by which we are ſanctified, and if ſanctified, then juſtified; yet not juſtified without ſatisfaction before made. Of the full meaning of this place, and of the true reconciliation of the Seventy Interpreters (whom the Apoſtle followes) with the Pſalmiſt
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7892:77"/>
or the Originall, by Gods grace hereafter. Thus much is pertinent to our preſent purpoſe, that the body which the Sonne of God aſſumed to do that will of his Father, which could not bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed by any other ſacrifices (though num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſſe and endleſſe) was a body fitted for all kindes of calamities and croſſes, which are inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unto mortality: a body more capable of paine, or deeper impreſſions from the violent occurrences of all externalls, which are naturall; than any other mans body was, or had been. A body as it were moulded and organized of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to bee animated or actuated with the ſpirit of obedience and all manner of patience in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, which can bee required in a faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. <hi>Servants</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Peter</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">1. Pet. 2.18, 19.</note>) <hi>bee obedient, &amp;c. For this is thankworthy, if a man for conſcience toward God endure griefe, ſuffering wrongfully.</hi> CHRIST JESUS who was the paterne of all obedience required in ſervants, not onely whileſt he was to deale with malicious unreaſonable men, but in the very <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> of his Agony, (when his heart within him was become like melting waxe through the vehemencie of that fiery triall) did ſet the faireſt copie of that obedience, which S. <hi>Peter</hi> requires ſhould bee taken out (how rudely ſoever) by every ſervant of God, under his owne hand. Even in this Agony when his mortall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits did faint and languiſh, the ſpirit of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was much ſtronger in him, than the pulſe of paine and ſorow. It did not intermit or abate when his paines and anguiſh did increaſe. <hi>Being
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7892:78"/>
in Agony</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Luke) hee prayed more earneſtly, Luk.</hi> 22.44. Theſe words I referre if not to the third, yet certainely to the ſecond paroxyſme of his Agony; one or more of which fits did wring blood from his ſacred body, being otherwiſe full of health. But moſt probable it is from S. <hi>Lukes</hi> relation. <hi>Chap.</hi> 22. <hi>ver.</hi> 44. that hee ſweat blood both in the firſt and ſecond fit, and that in all the three hee delivered his ſupplications <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>kneeling, or falling upon the ground.</hi> The forme of his prayer and maner of deportment in it, (as was ſaid before) exhibite a true document or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative argument, that beſides his Divine will, hee had a will truely humane, a reaſonable will in that hee did deſire or deprecate the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall or aſſwagement of his preſent ſufferings, with greater fervency of ſpirit and devotion, than any ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> could deprecate the paines of Hell, if they ſhould be beſet with them, or feele their approach. And yet withall, hee wholly ſubmits his humane body, ſoule, and will unto his heavenly Fathers will, who by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent had free power to diſpoſe of them in life and death, as hee pleaſed. Out of this fervent ſpirit of obedience conſecrated unto Gods ſervice by his moſt devout prayers, he was delivered from the paines and terrors, which he both feared and felt in the garden.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As for his ſacrifice upon the Croſſe, albeit we ſubduct the worth of it in it ſelfe conſidered (which infinitely exceeds the worth of all other ſacrifices;) it was moſt properly, and moſt really
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7892:78"/>
the ſacrifice of a broken heart, or contrite ſpirit. For after his naturall ſtrength was ſpent, and his bodily ſpirits diffuſed with his blood; hee laſtly offers up his immortall ſpirit, his very ſoule unto his Father. <hi>Father into thy hands I commend my ſpirit: and having ſaid thus he gave up the ghoſt, Luk.</hi> 23.46. The ſpirit of obedience did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire with bodily ſpirits, it did accompany his ſoule into Paradiſe: it was not put off with the forme of a ſervant, but cloathed upon with glory and immortality. Shall wee yet doubt, whether the ſacrifice upon the Croſſe being offered out of ſuch unexpreſſible obedience were fully ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make abundant ſatisfaction for all our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obediences; albeit wee ſhould ſubduct his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and patience in that grievous Agony in the garden?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If any man bee diſpoſed to move further doubt about this point; the Apoſtles authority, or rather his reaſon will put the point out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>But Chriſt being come an high Prieſt of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to ſay, not of this building: Neither by the blood of goats and calues; but by his owne blood hee entred in once into the holy place, having obtained eternall redemption for us. For if the blood of bulls and goats, and the aſhes of an heifer ſprinkling the uncleane, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh; how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternall ſpirit, offered himſelfe without ſpot to God, purge your conſciences from dead works, to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7892:79"/>
ſerve the living God?</hi> The forme and maner of his diſpute in this paſſage, as in moſt others throughout this Epiſtle, is allegoricall: but alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories in true Theologie alwayes include argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of proportion, and are as firme as any Geometricall or Mathematicall demonſtration. The termes of proportion in this argument are eſpecially foure. Firſt, ſinnes meerely ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, that is ſuch errors and eſcapes, as are evill becauſe forbidden, not evill in themſelves. The ſecond, the remedy appointed for ſuch ſinnes, and that was the blood of bulls and goats, &amp;c. The third, ſinnes properly ſo called, that is, all offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or treſpaſſes againſt the Law of nature, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law of God. Things not evill onely becauſe forbidden, but rather forbidden becauſe evill in their owne nature. The fourth terme is, the antidote or preſervative againſt ſuch ſinnes, as in their nature poiſon our ſoules: and this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne preſervative is onely the blood of Chriſt. The Apoſtle takes it for granted, that the ſacrifice of bulls and goats were ſufficient to make ſatisfaction for ſinnes merely ceremoniall; and the blood available ſo farre to ſanctifie the parties offending againſt the Law of Ceremonies, as that they might be admitted into the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, or ſtand <hi>recti</hi> in <hi>curia,</hi> after the ſacrifice was once offered. Of this purification concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the fleſh by the blood of ſuch ſacrifices, that which the Romaniſts ſay of the Sacraments of the new Teſtament, might bee more probably ſaid; <hi>Conferebant gratiam ex opere operato.</hi> The
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7892:79"/>
ceremoniall ſinne was taken away by a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall offering. From this knowen maxime con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the law of Ceremonies, or Legall ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices S. <hi>Paul</hi> takes his <hi>riſe</hi> unto the high myſterie of the Goſpel, to wit, that the offering which the Sonne of God did make upon the Croſſe, was more ſufficient, as well for making full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto God for all ſinnes committed againſt his Law, as for purifying the conſcience of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from dead works; more effectuall to make men partakers of the true celeſtiall Sanctuary, than the blood of beaſts was for making them le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally cleane. Purification from ſinne or ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication alwayes preſuppoſed full ſatisfaction for the ſinnes committed. To cleanſe men from ſins meerely ceremoniall, or to ſanctifie them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh the bloody ſacrifice of bruit beaſts was ſufficient, although they ſuffered no other paines than naturall, albeit they felt no force, or aſſault of any agents, but meerely natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, much more is the blood of Chriſt of force ſufficient not onely to make a full atonement for us, but to cleanſe us from all ſinnes, although he ſuffered no paines ſupernaturall, although he had ſuffered no force or impreſſion of any agents more than naturall. All this is but a branch of our Apoſtles inference. For albeit ſinnes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt the Morall Law of God, doe in a maner infinitely exceed ſinnes committed againſt the Law of Ceremonies onely: yet are not the ſinnes of the one kinde ſo much more hainous, than the ſinnes of the other, as the blood of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7892:80"/>
Chriſt doth for vertue exceed the blood of bulls and goats. Nor is there that odds <hi>of difference</hi> betwixt ſinnes Moral, and ſinnes Ceremonial, which is between the Prieſts of the Law, and the high Prieſt of our ſoules, the Sonne of God. And yet the maine ground of our Apoſtles infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence doth not ſimply conſiſt in the ſuperexcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the high Prieſt of our ſoules, or of the ſacrifice which hee offered, in compariſon with legall Prieſts and their ſacrifices, but withall in the admirable union of our high Prieſt and his ſacrifice. For admit it as poſſible, firſt, that there might haue been ſome matter of ſacrifice, as pure and ſpotleſſe, as the body of our Saviour; more pure and glorious than the Angelicall ſubſtances: Secondly, that this pure and ſpotleſſe ſacrifice had been offered by a Prieſt for dignity equall to the Sonne of God (as by the Holy Ghoſt the third Perſon in Trinity:) yet his offering or ſervice could not have been ſo acceptable unto God, as our Saviours offering or ſervice was; becauſe the infinite worth of the Prieſt or Perſon ſacrificing, could not in this caſe have conferred any worth or vertue truely infinite upon the ſacrifice or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering made by him, though as holy and glorious as any created ſubſtance can bee; unleſſe it had been ſo perſonally united to him, that in offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, hee had offered himſelfe, as our Saviour did. This is the maine ſtemme or rather the root of our Apoſtles emphaticall inference or ſurplus in the forecited place. <hi>How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt who through the eternall Spirit offered
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7892:80"/>
himſelfe without ſpot to God, purge your conſcience from dead works to ſerve the living God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Anſwerable to this hypoſtaticall or perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall union betweene our high Prieſt and his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, was that union between his obedience to his Father, and his mercy and compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men. Obedience, mercy and ſacrifice were ſo united in his offering, as they never had been before his owne death was the internall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his mercy towards us, and obedience to his Father the period of his humiliation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: <hi>Hee humbled himſelfe and became obedient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, even unto the death of the Croſſe.</hi> That we know, was a cruell and ſervile death; but no part of the ſecond death, not charged with the paines of Hell: otherwiſe our Apoſtle would have mentioned them, as the accompliſhment of his obedience, or of his ſervice; which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them did exceed the very abſtract or paterne either of ſervice or obedience. <hi>Quid eſt ſervitus, niſi obedientia animi fracti, &amp; arbitrio carentis ſuo? Servitude</hi> (ſaith <note n="*" place="margin">In his Paradoxes</note> 
                     <hi>Tully) is nothing elſe but the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of a broken or dejected minde, utterly deprived of all power or right to diſpoſe of it ſelfe,</hi> or of its actions. It is indeed dejection of minde, a bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken eſtate, or baſeneſſe of condition; which make men willing to become ſervants unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or inforceth them to reſigne all their right and power unto their Maſters will. But it was no dejection of minde, no want of any thing in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or earth, but onely the abundance of mercy and compaſſion towards us miſerable men, which
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7892:81"/>
moved the Sonne of God to renounce this world before he came into it, and to deprive himſelfe of all that right and intereſt, which every other man hath over his owne body and ſoule, by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary reſignation of his entire humane nature unto the ſole diſpoſing of his Father. Other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were obedient unto their Lords upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, or dejection of minde: hee voluntarily became a ſervant to his Father, that he might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the office of a ſervant in the ſacrifice of a broken and contrite ſpirit. This was the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall effect of his ſervice and obedience, and this ſacrifice thus offered was all-ſufficient to make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for all the diſobedience of men; for the ſinnes of ten thouſand worlds of men.</p>

God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. Betweene paines naturall and the paines of

Hell, there is a meane; to wit, paines altogether ſupernaturall in reſpect of the Agent, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes more than naturall in reſpect of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: and ſuch paines out of all queſtion the Son of God did ſuffer in the garden, though not upon the Croſſe. Nor were theſe his ſufferings ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, though no way neceſſary for paying the full ranſome or price of mans redemption or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation unto God. Moſt expedient they were, if not neceſſary to other purpoſes: As <hi>firſt,</hi> for his abſolute conqueſt over Satan. <hi>Secondly,</hi> for his conſecration to his everlaſting Prieſthood. Of his conflict with Satan in the garden (a place ſutable to that wherein hee had conquered our firſt Parents,) <hi>Iobs</hi> ſecond temptation was the type or ſhadow. His Father expoſed him to the ſecond temptation, as he had unto the firſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the wilderneſſe, and permitted Satan to exerciſe the utmoſt of his power againſt him: onely over his ſoule or life hee had no power. Theſe were take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from him by the malice of men, and by the death of the Croſſe, not by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate power of Satan. That the conflict in the garden was extraordinary; that in this houre the decretorie battle betwixt the old Serpent and the womans ſeed was to be fought (at leaſt the brunt of it;) the letter of the Scripture is to my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion very plaine: As firſt from that ſpeech of our Saviours after his <hi>Maundy, Ioh.</hi> 15.13. <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after I will not talke much with you: for the Prince of this world commeth:</hi> with greater violence ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than at any time before had been permitted
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7892:82"/>
him to uſe. For our Saviour uttered theſe words immediatly after Satan had entred into <hi>Iudas:</hi> at which time his Commiſſion to enter the liſts with the holy ſeed of the woman was firſt to bee put in execution. It hath alwayes ſeemed to me a myſtery or ſecret, whereof no reaſon can bee given in nature, how Satan gaines greater power of doing miſchiefes and harmes to men by ſecret compact with others of their owne nature, as with Witches, or other of his owne worſhippers; than is permitted him to uſe by his owne imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate power or ſtrength. <hi>Iudas,</hi> though hee was no Witch, yet was hee a worſhipper of Satan, one who had made <hi>Mammon</hi> his God, for whoſe ſervice he had reſolved to betray his Maſter into the hands of his enemies. It is pregnant againe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſaying of our Saviour immediatly upon the ceſſation or intermiſſion of his Agony and bloody ſweat, that Satans aſſaults were at this time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary; <hi>When I was dayly with you in the Temple, you ſtretched out no hand againſt mee: ſed haec eſt hora veſtra, &amp; poteſtas tenebrarum, But this is your houre, and the houre appointed for the powers of darkneſſe to try their ſtrength againſt mee.</hi> But after they could get no advantage of him by grapling with him in the garden, being not able to move him to the leaſt ſignification of any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, or overture of diſcontent, as Satan had done <hi>Iob</hi> in his ſecond temptation; they leave him unto the malice of his mortall Enemies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſured they ſhould get advantage enough over their ſoules, and prevalently tempt them to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7892:82"/>
cruelty and hatred towards this holy One, more than naturall. The houre of his terrible combat with Satan was but newly expiring, when thus he ſpake to the chiefe Prieſts and Elders. And howbeit this word <hi>houre</hi> ſometimes imports more than an houre (as wee ſay) by the clock, ſome larger indefinite time or ſeaſon: yet that in the forecited place it is to bee taken for a juſt houre, and no more, many circumſtances of the Text perſwade mee: (this eſpecially) when hee ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>Could yee not watch with mee one houre?</hi> As if he had ſaid, Of all the time that I have been with you, this was the onely houre, wherein your watchfulneſſe and attendance on me had been on your parts moſt requiſite, and to me moſt acceptable. And the effect of his peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as S. <hi>Mark</hi>

This conflict with Satan, and the iſſue of it, our Saviour apprehended at his triumphant ingreſſe into Jeruſalem immediatly after his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture glorification was avouched by a voice from heaven three dayes before hee entred into his Agony. <hi>Now is my ſoule troubled, and what ſhall I ſay?

And for this cauſe I muſt requeſt the ingenuous Reader for the preſent to take a matter which before was propoſed, into deeper conſideration. The point is briefly this; Our firſt Parents in the ſelfe ſame fact by which they became rebellious, <hi>ipſo jure,</hi> committing high treaſon againſt their God and Creator, did ſubject themſelves, and their poſterity, unto the tyrannicall dominion of Satan. His vaſſailes and ſlaves all of vs were by right moſt ſoveraigne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ſonnes of men, by right of conqueſt in Duel. Now albeit the Conquerer was a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and rebell againſt God; although he did firſt commit or at leaſt accompliſh this his rebellion and treaſon, by withdrawing our firſt Parents from that allegiance and obedience which by law of nature they and wee ought perpetually to have borne unto our Maker: Yet ſo obſervant of all rules of equity and juſt forme of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, was he who is goodneſſe, equity, and juſtice it ſelfe; that unto Satan the profeſſed Rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and implacable Enemy towards man, he did vouchſafe the benefit of the Law of Armes or Duel. Now ſeeing Satan, being not Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent

but of power, force, and ſubtilty limited, had thus ſubdued our firſt Parents, whom their Creator had endowed with freedome and power ſufficient to diſpoſe of their actions for the future good of themſelves, and their poſterity: his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious goodneſſe would not take us out of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels hands by the Omnipotent power or irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble force of his Godhead. Man being conquered by his ſometimes fellow creature, was in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Divine equity, to bee reſcued from this bondage by a Creature, by a man of the ſame nature and ſubſtance, ſubject to all the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (ſinne excepted) to which wee are ſubject: as taking his ſubſtance from that man whom Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan had conquered. As Satan did not appeare in his owne ſhape or likeneſſe, when hee ſubdued our firſt Parents (for ſo no queſtion they would have been more wary to have cloſed with him;) but diſguiſed in the ſimilitude of a Serpent, which was a creature more ſubtill than all the beaſts of the field, yet a creature every way farre inferiour to man: So the Sonne of God did not enter this combat with Satan in the glory and ſtrength of his Godhead, but in his Godhead as it were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed or clothed upon with the true nature and ſubſtance of man, and of a man whom Satan up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on triall before had knowen to be throughly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the infirmities of mortality.

But that our Saviour in this life ſhould ſuffer ſuch paines is incredible: for this being granted, the powers of darkneſſe had prevailed more againſt him, than Satan did againſt <hi>Iob.</hi> For the actuall ſuffering ſuch paines includes more then a taſte, a draught of the ſecond death, unto which no man is ſubject, before he die the firſt death: nor was it poſſible that our Saviour ſhould ever taſte them either dying or living, or after death. This error, it ſeemes, hath ſurprized ſome (otherwaies good Divines) through incogitancie, or want of ſkill in Philoſophie. For by the unerring rules of true Philoſophy, the nature, quality, or meaſure of paines muſt bee taken, not ſo much from the force or violence of the Agent, as from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or temper of the Patient: <hi>Actus agentium ſunt in patiente rite diſpoſito.</hi> The fire hath not the ſame operation upon Gold, as it hath upon Lead; nor the ſame upon greene wood, which it hath on dry. Or if a man ſhould deale his blowes with an eeven hand betweene one ſound of body, and of ſtrong bones; and another ſickly, craſie, or wounded: the paines though iſſuing from the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7892:84"/>
equality of the blowes, would be moſt unequall. That which would hardly put the one to any paine at all, might drive the other into the very pangs of death. <hi>Goliath</hi> did looke as big, did ſpeake as roughly, and every way behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as ſternly againſt little <hi>David,</hi> as hee had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Saul,</hi> and the whole hoaſt of Iſrael: Yet his preſence though in it ſelfe terrible, did make no ſuch impreſſion of terrour upon <hi>David,</hi> as it had done upon <hi>Saul,</hi> and the ſtouteſt Champions in his hoaſt. And the reaſon, why it did not, was becauſe <hi>David</hi> was armed with the ſhield of faith, and confidence in the Lord his God; a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Armour which was not then to be found in all the Kingdome of Iſrael beſides. But a farre greater then <hi>Goliath,</hi> aſſociated and ſeconded with a farre greater hoaſt, both for number and ſtrength, than the Philiſtines in <hi>Davids</hi> time were able to make; more maliciouſly bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the whole race of <hi>Adam,</hi> than the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines at this or any other time were againſt the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> was now in field. And all of us are bound to praiſe our gracious God, that in that houre wee had a Sonne of <hi>David</hi> farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than his Father to ſtand betweene us and the brunt of the battell then pitched againſt us. For if all mankinde from the Eaſt unto the Weſt, which have lived on earth ſince our Father <hi>Adams</hi> fall unto this preſent time, or ſhall continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all future generations, had been then muſtred together, all of us would have fled more ſwiftly, and more confuſedly from the ſight or preſence
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7892:85"/>
of this great Champion for the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, than the hoaſt of Iſrael did from the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of the Philiſtines, when hee bid a defiance unto them. All of us had been <hi>routed</hi> at the firſt encounter without any ſlaughter, been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alive to perpetuall ſlavery and impriſonment. But did this Sonne of <hi>David</hi> obtaine victory in this Duel with the Champion for the powers of darkneſſe, at as eaſie a rate as his Father <hi>David</hi> had done over <hi>Goliath?</hi> No: If wee ſtretch the ſimilitude thus farre, wee ſhall diſſolve the ſweet harmony betweene the type and the Antitype. The conqueſt which the Sonne of <hi>David</hi> had over Satan and the powers of darkneſſe (whether in the garden or upon the Croſſe,) was more glorious then that which <hi>David</hi> had over <hi>Goliath,</hi> or Iſrael over the Philiſtines. <hi>David</hi> was Maſter of the field <hi>ſine ſanguine &amp; ſudore multo,</hi> without blood, or much ſweat. The Sonne of <hi>David</hi> did ſweat much blood before hee foiled his potent Adverſary. And the preſent queſtion is not about the meaſure but about the nature and quality of the pains which the Sonne of <hi>David</hi> in this long Combat ſuffered, in reſpect of the paines which <hi>David</hi> or any other in the behalfe of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had ſuffered. As the glory of our Saviour Chriſt is now much greater, than the glory of all his Saints which have been or ſhall be hereafter: ſo no doubt his ſufferings did farre exceed the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of all his Martyrs. But all this and much more being granted, will not inferre that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered either the paines of Hell or helliſh paines
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7892:85"/>
                     <hi>(poenas infernales, aut poenas inferorum:)</hi> ſuch paines as the power of darkneſſe in that houre of extraordinary temptation had caſt all mankinde into, unleſſe the Sonne of <hi>David</hi> had ſtood in the breach. Admit the old Serpent had been in that houre permitted to <hi>exert</hi> his ſting with all the might and malice he could, againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed womans ſeed, that is, the manhood of the Sonne of God: yet ſeeing (as the Apoſtle ſaith) the ſting of death is ſinne (not imputed but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent) it was impoſſible that the ſtinging paines of the ſecond death ſhould faſten upon his body or ſoule, in whom there was neither ſeed nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, neither root or branch of ſinne. Or againe, admit hell fire (whether materiall or immateriall) be of a more violent and malignant quality, than any materiall fire which we know, in what ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſoever it bee ſeated, is; and that the powers of darkneſſe with their entire and joint force had liberty to environ or begirt the Sonne of God with this fire or any other inſtruments of greater torture, which they are enabled or permitted to uſe: yet ſeeing there was no fuell either in his ſoule or body, whereon this fire could feed; no paines could bee produced in him for nature or quality truely helliſh, or ſuch as the damned ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. For theſe are ſupernaturall, or more than ſo, not only in reſpect of the Agents or cauſes which produce them, but in reſpect of the Subject which endures them. Satan findes alwayes ſome thing in them, which he armes againſt them; ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent internall corruption, which hee exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates

to greater malignity, than any externall force or violence could effect in any creature not tainted with ſuch internall corruption, from which the promiſed womans ſeed was more free than his crucified body was from putrifaction. The Prince of darkneſſe and this world could finde nothing which hee could exaſperate or arme againſt him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In reſpect of Divine juſtice, or of thoſe eternall rules of equity which the Omnipotent Creator doth moſt ſtrictly obſerve; it was not expedient only but neceſſary that the Son of God ſhould in our fleſh vanquiſh Satan, and vanquiſh him by ſuffering evills, even all the evills incident to our mortall nature. There was no neceſſity, no congruity that the Sonne of God ſhould van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh this great Enemy of mankinde by ſuffering the very paines of Hell or helliſh torments. Theſe properly taken, or when they are ſuffered in kind, are the proper fruits and neceſſary effects of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans victory over ſinners; the finall wages of ſinnes unrepented of or not actually expiated by the blood of our Redeemer. In all other tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, diſtreſſes, or perſecutions, which are not the wages of ſinne, We are, (as our Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35, 37.) <hi>more then Conquerers through him that loved us,</hi> if ſo we endure them with patience.

Otherwiſe, he had not been full Conquerer over hell and the ſecond death, which is no other than the paines of Hell, or helliſh torments. Nor could the ſufferings of ſuch torments bee any part of the Sonne of Gods qualification for diſſolving thoſe works of Satan, which cannot be diſſolved but by the exerciſe of his everlaſting Prieſthood, which was the laſt end or finall cauſe of his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings or conſecration by afflictions.</p>

faithfull and mercifull high Prieſt in things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, than ever any before him had been, or can be. But Satan, we know, tempteth no man in this life unto ſinne either with the feare or ſufferings of any evill or vexations, whereof our mortality can have no experience. Hee labours to withdraw no man from Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice by giving them any taſte or touch of the paines prepared for the damned in the life to come. Such as are in the deepeſt bonds of thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to him, would quickly abandon his ſervice, if hee ſhould tender them ſuch a true ſymbole or earneſt of their everlaſting wages, or ſuch a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany taſte of Hell paines, as the Spirit of God in this life exhibiteth to ſome of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of their everlaſting joyes. And it is queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable whether our nature whileſt mortall bee capable of ſuch paines, or whether the firſt touch or reall impreſſion of them would not diſſolve the link or bond betweene mans mortall body, and his immortall ſoule in a moment.

But though no man in this life be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ill, or withdrawen from the ſervice of God, by ſufferance of ſuch paines; yet in as much as many are oft times tempted to deſpaire of Gods mercies by the <hi>unknowne</hi> terrors of Hell, or
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7892:87"/>
repreſentations of infernall forces: there is no queſtion but the Sonne of God, not in his Divine wiſdome onely, by which he knoweth all things, but even as man, had a more diſtinct view of all the forces, and terrors of Hell, more full expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of their active force and attempts, than any man in this life can have; to the end that he might bee a faithfull Comforter of all ſuch unto the worlds end, as ſhall bee affrighted or attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them.

By that which was done againſt the greene tree hee knoweth what will become of the drie, if it bee expoſed to the like fiery triall. It was requiſite that this great Captaine of Gods warfare with Satan, and of our ſalvation, ſhould have a perfect view of all the forces which fight againſt us; that hee might bee a faithfull Solicitor to his Almighty Father for aid, and ſuccour unto all that are beſet with them, unto all that offer up ſtrong cries un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, as hee in the dayes of his fleſh did unto his Father, and was ſaved from that which hee feared.</p>

For whatſoever hee ſuffered in thoſe two bitter dayes, he ſuffered, if not for this end alone, yet for this eſpecially, that hee might bee an All-ſufficient Comforter unto all ſuch as mourne; as having ſometimes had more than a fellow fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of all our infirmities and vexations, as one who had taſted deeper of the cup of ſorow and death it ſelfe, then any man before him had done, or to the worlds end ſhall doe.

And ſo, it would bee to a man eaten out of his eſtate by uſury or vexations in Law, to have a Judge or Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor who had been both wayes more grievouſly wronged; a juſt, or upright man, whoſe heart would melt with the fellow-feeling of his cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. Experience of bodily paines or grievous diſeaſes inclineth the Chirurgion or Phyſician to bee more compaſſionate to their Patients, and more tender of their well-fare than otherwiſe they would be. And for theſe reaſons, ever ſince I tooke them into conſideration, and as often as I reſume the meditations of our Saviours death, I have ever wondred and ſtill doe wonder at the peeviſhneſſe, or rather patheticall prophaneſſe

For I dare undertake to make good that there is not either branch or fruit, bloſſome or leafe in that ſacred garden of devotions which doth not naturally ſpring and draw its life and nouriſhment from one or other of the three former roots, to wit, from the Lords prayer, or from the Creed ſet prayer wiſe, or from the ten Commandements.

                  <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>N Apoſtle hath ſaid it, and wee muſt beleeve him, that our Saviour Chriſt was <hi>Agnus occiſus ab origine mundi; the Lamb ſlaine from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world.</hi> And other Scriptures abundantly teſtifie, that he was to bee ſlaughtered in time, to the end that hee might take away the ſinnes of the world. About the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7892:91"/>
indefinite or illimited truth of both theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, there is no controverſie amongſt good Chriſtians. The limitation notwithſtanding of both theſe undoubted truths require ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſquiſition; the limitation of the later a larger Treatiſe: The maine <hi>Quere</hi> concerning the former is briefly this. [From what begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world our Saviour is ſaid to be <hi>Agnus occiſus, the Lamb ſlaine,</hi>] as whether from the firſt beginning of time, or from the firſt day of the Creation. To ſtretch the beginning of the world thus farre, is more than the rules of true Theologie will warrant. For it was neither ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary or expedient, that the Sonne of God ſhould bee ſlaine, or that any bloody ſacrifice ſhould have been offered, if our firſt Parents had preſerved or retained their originall integrity. By the beginning of the world, then in our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles meaning, wee are, I take it, to underſtand the ſinfull world, as it is coevall or confederate with the fleſh, or the firſt entrance of ſinne into it or rather into our nature. From the fall of our firſt Parents, at leaſt from their convention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Almighty Judge and Creator; the Sonne of God was firſt deſtinated, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conſecrated to be the Lamb of God, which was to take away the ſinnes of the world. And of his death and paſſion, or other undertakings to this purpoſe, as well the ſacrifice which righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Abel</hi> offered out of the flock, as the bloody ſacrifice of himſelfe, being butchered by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious brother <hi>Cain,</hi> were true types or ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7892:92"/>
So was the Paſchall Lamb, which was ſolemnly offered every yeare, once in token, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in memory of the Iſraelites miraculous delivery out of Aegypt. The firſt inſtitution, and obſervance of this ſolemnity, was given as a pledge or aſſurance unto Gods choſen people, that the deſtroyer ſhould not hurt one of them, when he ſmote all the firſt borne of Aegypt, both of man and beaſt. The ſame ſolemnity was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards continued in memory of that mighty deliverance, which Iſrael had from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoaſt. Howbeit even this miraculous delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was but a ſhadow or typicall aſſurance of that great deliverance which the Sonne of God in our fleſh, and all Gods people, in him and by him, had from the powers of Hell and darkneſſe, in that great Paſſeover, wherein this true Lamb of God predeſtinated to this purpoſe from the beginning of this world, was actually conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſolemnly upon his conſecration, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A queſtion there is, but ſoberly handled by ſome good ſacred Antiquaries; whether the Law of the Paſchall Lamb delivered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> were to bee ſolemnized according to all the rites and circumſtances, which were enjoyned, and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to bee obſerved at the time of Iſraels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of Aegypt. One branch of this Law it was, that every houſhold which was capable of eating it, ſhould take it from the flock foure dayes before the offering of it. This ſeparation was his conſecration, and this rite or ceremony,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7892:92"/>
as ſome good Writers tell us, was obſerved throughout the generations, if not in the Lambs offered by every private family, yet in the Lamb deſigned or choſen for the publique ſacrifice in that great Feſtivall, which was brought into the City foure dayes before the offering of it, with great pomp and ſolemnity. But bee it that the ſolemnity of bringing the Lamb foure dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Paſſeover, was to bee obſerved onely in Aegypt: this will no way impaire the ſweet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony betweene the Legall type and the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall myſtery; but rather give it a better luſtre: For that Paſſeover which was celebrated in Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt was the moſt illuſtrious peculiar type of this great Paſſeover, wherein the Sonne of God was ſacrificed for the ſinnes of the world. Other ſucceeding legall Paſſeovers were but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of that great deliverance whereof the firſt Paſſeover in Aegypt was the pledge, or pre-aſſurance. And we in like ſort were once for all delivered from the powers of Hell and darkneſſe, by the viſible blood of the new Covenant; of which deliverance, wee are more ſtrictly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to continue a memoriall, untill our Mediator and Redeemer come to judgement. Now to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto the world, that JESUS the Sonne of God and of <hi>David,</hi> was the Lamb of God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained from the beginning of the world to effect this mighty deliverance, and to fulfill the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries forepictured by the Paſſeover in Aegypt; He came unto Jeruſalem (the place appointed for this and other grand Feſtivalls) foure dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7892:93"/>
the Paſſeover wherein hee was ſacrificed, and was brought in with greater pompe and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, than any Paſchall Lamb, than any Prince of Judah at any time before had been. His attendants were more, and their reſpects and ſalutations tendered in more ſubmiſſive manner, and the titles given to him much loftier than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>David</hi> his father or <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his royalty had been accuſtomed unto. The hiſtory of his comming is very remarkable of it ſelfe, and the circumſtances as they are variouſly related (yet without claſhing or contradiction,) by all the foure Evangeliſts, moſt conſiderable.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the circumſtance of time, which was foure dayes before the Paſſeover, that is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately and punctually ſet downe by two Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, and may be evidently inferred out of all foure. The ſpeciall occaſions of a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of people out of ſeverall Nations or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, which at this laſt Paſſeover did expect his comming, or went out of Jeruſalem to meet him or wait upon him, after another guiſe, than at any the three former Paſſeovers ſince his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme had been ſeene; are moſt fully expreſt by S. <hi>Iohn Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 45. <hi>Then many of the Iews which came to Mary, and had ſeene the things which Ieſus did, beleeved on him. But ſome of them went their wayes to the Phariſees and told them what things Ieſus had done.</hi> John 12.9, 17, 18. <hi>Much people of the Iews knew therefore that he was there; and they came, not for Ieſus ſake onely, but that they might ſee Lazarus alſo, whom hee had raiſed from the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7892:93"/>
dead. The people therefore that was with him, when hee called Lazarus out of his grave, and raiſed him from the dead, bare record. For this cauſe alſo the people met him, for that they had heard, that he had done this miracle, &amp;c.</hi> The originall occaſion of this great concourſe, as appeares in theſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, was the irrefragable teſtimony of his rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the grave, wherein he had laid foure dayes. The ſpeciall occaſions which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the whole multitude of his Diſciples (that is ſuch as for the preſent did beleeve in him) to entertaine, and did occaſion others to entertaine him with thoſe extraordinary acclamations, or other expreſſions of joy &amp; exultation, (recorded by all the Evangeliſts) are moſt punctually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by S. <hi>Luke, Chap.</hi> 19. <hi>ver.</hi> 37, 38. <hi>And when hee was come nigh, even now at the deſcent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the Diſciples began to rejoyce, and praiſe God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works that they had ſeene, ſaying, Bleſſed be the King that commeth in the Name of the Lord, peace in heaven, and glory in the Higheſt.</hi> Theſe acclamations of his followers and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were ſo loud, and their exultation (in ſuch ſiniſter conſtruction, as <hi>Michal</hi> made of <hi>Davids</hi> dancing before the Ark) ſo laviſh, that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated the Phariſees (who were but a ſmall part of the multitude, who did attend or obſerve his approch,) unto more uncivill behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this their King, than <hi>Michal</hi> did uſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>David</hi> her Lord and huſband. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.39. <hi>And ſome of the Phariſees from among the multitude
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7892:94"/>
ſaid unto him, Maſter, rebuke thy Diſciples:</hi> As if they had ſaid, Thy Diſciples play the fooles: and unleſſe thou inhibit their folly, they will make thee a laughing ſtock to wiſe men. But his reply unto them for this their adviſe, though for termes and language, more milde and gentle; yet for the matter or myſtery implied, was more ſharpe than <hi>Davids</hi> was to <hi>Michal:</hi> Verſe 40. <hi>He anſwered, and ſaid unto them, I tell you, that if theſe ſhould hold their peace, the ſtones would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly cry out.</hi> For this was the time wherein Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and the daughter of Sion had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſome hundreds of yeares before, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce after an unuſuall maner. And the juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of this extraordinary point of time above all others, did require ſuch a ſolemne and publike teſtification, that if men, women, and children had been ſilent, the very ſtones in the ſtreet, the edifices and pavements in Jeruſalem and Sion, muſt have ſupplied their defect. For theſe were appurtenances of the Citie, which had been pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily injoyned to ſhout for joy whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their promiſed and long expected King ſhould come unto her. As the occaſions of this extraordinary concourſe of people, and of their unuſuall exultation, are moſt fully expreſt by S. <hi>Iohn</hi> and S. <hi>Luke:</hi> ſo the finall cauſe of both, or ſweet diſpoſition of Divine providence in this whole buſineſſe, is moſt punctually expreſt by S. <hi>Matthew, Chap.</hi> 21. <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. <hi>All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet ſaying; Tell yee the Daughter of Sion, Behold, thy

                     <pb n="181" facs="tcp:7892:95"/>2. <hi>The burden of the word of the Lord in the Land of Hadrach, and Damaſcus ſhall bee the reſt thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all the Tribes of Iſrael, ſhall bee toward the Lord. And Hamah alſo ſhall border thereby, Tyrus and Zidon though it bee very wiſe. And Tyrus did build her ſelfe a ſtrong hold, and heaped up ſilver as the duſt, and fine gold, as the mire of the ſtreets. Behold the Lord will caſt her out, and hee will ſmite her power in the Sea, and ſhee ſhall be devoured with fire, Zechariah,</hi> 9.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in his booke of Jewiſh Antiquities, briefly relating the ſwift ſucceſſe of <hi>Alexander</hi> in his warre, relateth the events in the ſame order and method, which the Prophet <hi>Zachariah</hi> had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told them in. That he firſt over-ran Syria &amp; took Damaſcus, and afterward beſieged Tyre, which held out nine moneths againſt thoſe forces which had conquered the Perſians, Syrians, and other Eaſterne parts in leſſe ſpace. As for the Writ drawen for the execution of Tyre, you ſee it is punctually drawen by the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi>; but who ſhall aſſure us that it paſſed the Seale, or was executed according to the tenor of his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. <hi>By her power in the Sea,</hi> the Prophet meant, as the Oracle in like caſe did, her woodden walls or multitude of ſhips: and theſe as <hi>Curtius</hi> tells us, being almoſt all ſunck or taken, their chiefe Fort was ſurprized by the Macedonian Army. After her walls were ſcaled, the greateſt part of her defendants <hi>ſumma tectorum obtinebant, ſaxa, &amp; quod in manibus fors dederat ingerentes ſubeuntibus,</hi> did anoy the Aſſailants from the tops of their
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7892:96"/>
houſes with ſtones, or whatſoever came firſt to hand. So this their laſt and deſperate fury did blow the fire of Gods wrath which was kindled againſt them, from the Prophet <hi>Zacharies</hi> time. For as this Heatheniſh Writer addes, <hi>Alexander exceptis qui in templa confugerant, omnes interfici ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemque tectis injici jubet,</hi> commands that all ſhould be ſlaine beſides ſuch as fled into the Temples, that their dwelling houſes ſhould be burnt. This great Conqueror in all this warre, though he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly knew not his Commiſſion, was but Gods Sheriffe: and (though intending no ſuch thing) did ſee the execution ſhould be according to the Prophets ſentence. How much Tyrian blood was ſhed in this ſiege, as <hi>Curtius</hi> ſaith, may in part be hence gathered; beſides all that died in that miſerable Sea-fight, or thoſe fierce ſkirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges about the walls after the Macedonians had made entry both by Sea and Land; ſixe thouſand of ſuch as bare Armes were forthwith ſlaine, two thouſand hanged on gibbets along the ſhoare, <hi>that Askalon,</hi> as it followeth in the Prophet, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>might ſee it, and feare, and the hopes of Ekronbe confounded.</hi> And as <hi>Arrianus, Ioſephus,</hi> and ſome other tells us. Tyre being thus miſerably ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſackt, the other Cities of Syria or Paleſtina, yeelded without reſiſtance. Onely the ſtrength of Scituation, ſtore of proviſion, the reſolution and fidelity of the Governour to <hi>Darius</hi> the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Emperour, emboldned <hi>Gaza</hi> to hold out for a time, as ſtoutly, as Tyre had done. For that part which God had appointed her, and her King
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7892:96"/>
or Governour to act, was not feare, but ſorrow. <hi>Askelon ſhall ſee it, and feare, Gaza alſo ſhall ſee it, and be very ſorowfull, and Ekron for her expectation ſhall be aſhamed, and the King ſhall periſh from Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za, and Askelon ſhall not be inhabited,</hi> ver. 5.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The greater danger the Conqueror him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did in the aſſault of <hi>Gaza</hi> incurre, the more grievous was her ranſack, and the greater was the cruelty practiſed upon the conquered. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> wounded body did exaſperate his heroicall minde to imitate <hi>Achilles</hi> (his pretended Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor) as much at this time in deſpightfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, as at other times hee had done in valour. For by <hi>Alexanders</hi> appointment <hi>Batis,</hi> as <hi>Curtius</hi> inſtiles him, the Governour of <hi>Gaza</hi> or Deputy King for <hi>Darius,</hi> being yet as full of life and ſpirit, as of bleeding wounds, was dragged by the heeles after a Chariot through the ſtreets, as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> had been by <hi>Achilles</hi> about the walls of <hi>Troy.</hi> Thus doth confidence in cauſes accurſed by God, inevitably bring their undertakers to thoſe diſaſtrous ends, whereto the juſt will of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Judge had for their ſinnes appointed them. All this, and much more which <hi>Curtius</hi> and <hi>Arrianus</hi> relate concerning the deſolation of <hi>Gaza</hi> (wee need not be afraid to ſpeake it) came to paſſe, that the word of the Lord ſpoken by <hi>Zachariah</hi> might be fulfilled. <hi>The King ſhall periſh from Gaza, &amp;c. ver.</hi> 5. Yet would I not have theſe words concerning <hi>Gaza,</hi> and her Governor, being for quantity indefinite, reſtrained to this particular time or accident. For that were to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7892:97"/>
make this diſaſter the compleat object of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall ſenſe, of which it is at the moſt but a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall part. This wofull accident might, and I take it, did portend the like in ſucceſſe of time, and I have ever held thoſe Interpreters ſhort ſighted, rather than overſeene, who thinke the ſeverall paſſages in this Prophecie muſt literally referre onely to the warres of <hi>Alexander,</hi> or of the <hi>Maccabees.</hi> For multitude of like events, though different onely in time, not in proportion to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall predictions, can neither argue any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity in their former object, nor any plurality of literall ſenſes. All in their order may be alike literally meant by the ſame Prophet, all alike properly ſignified by the ſame words. No man queſtioneth whether <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="4">4. Hitherto we have ſeene how God by <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> begun to pull downe the pride of Tyre, and of the Philiſtines: not with purpoſe utterly to deſtroy them, as he did the old world, but rather by this caſtigation or contuſion, to prepare and fit them for that mixture with the Jews their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Enemies, which was foretold by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Zachariah, ver.</hi> 6, 7. <hi>And a</hi>

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7892:97"/>
ſhall bee as a Governour in Iudah, and Ekron as a Iebuſit.</hi> The literall truth of this laſt cited paſſage, we may ſee experienced after the warres of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> and of his Succeſſors with the <hi>Maceabees,</hi> partly in that great place which <hi>Herod</hi> of Aſke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon held amongſt the Jewiſh Nation, partly in the Philiſtines Proſelytes, who were admitted as Communicants with the ſonnes of <hi>Abraham</hi> in their Sacraments and Sacrifices, partly in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Jews as free Denizens into the Cities of Paleſtina, and in ſuch quiet cohabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Philiſtines and theſe moderne Jews, as had been betweene the Jebuſits and their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. Every part of this obſervation might be concludently proved out of unpartiall Hiſtorians, Heatheniſh or Jewiſh, which wrote before our Lord and Saviour was borne. Divers parts of it are abundantly proved out of the Author of the firſt Book of <hi>Maccabees, Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 88, 89. <hi>Now when King Alexander heard theſe things</hi> (to wit, the victory over Azotus, and the ſubmiſſion of Aſkelon upon the ranſack of it,) <hi>he honoured Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan yet more, and ſent him a buckle of gold, as the uſe is to bee given to ſuch as are of the Kings blood: hee gave him alſo Accaron with the borders thereof in poſſeſsion.</hi> Chap. 11. ver. 60, 61. <hi>Then Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan went forth, and paſſed through the Cities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the water, and all the forces of Syria gathered themſelves unto him, for to helpe him: and when he came to Askalon, they of the City met him honourably. From whence he went to Gaza, but they of Gaza ſhut him out: wherefore he laid ſiege unto it, and burned
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7892:98"/>
the ſuburbs thereof with fire and ſpoiled them.</hi> Chap. 13. ver. 33, &amp;c. <hi>Then Simon built up the ſtrong holds in Iudea, and fenced them about with high Towres and great walls and gates and barres; and laid up victuals therein. Moreover Simon choſe men, and ſent to King Demetrius, to the end hee ſhould give the land an immunity, becauſe all that Tryphon did, was to ſpoile. Vnto whom King De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius anſwered and wrote after this maner; King Demetrius unto Simon the high Prieſt, and friend of Kings, as alſo unto the Elders and Nation of the Iews, ſendeth greeting. The golden Crowne, and the ſcarlet Robe which yee ſent unto us, wee have received, and wee are ready to make a ſtedfaſt peace with you, yea and to write unto your Officers to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the immunities which wee have granted. And whatſoever Covenants wee have made with you, ſhall ſtand; and the ſtrong holds which you have builded, ſhall be your owne. As for any overſight, or fault committed unto this day, wee forgive it, and the Crown tax alſo, which yee owe us, if there were any other tribute paid in Ieruſalem, it ſhall no more bee paid. And looke who are meet among you to bee in our Court, let them be inrolled, and let there be peace betwixt us. Thus the yoke of the Heathen was taken away from Iſrael in the hundred and ſeventieth yeare. Then the people of Iſrael began to write in their Inſtruments and Contracts, In the firſt yeare of Simon the high Prieſt, the Governour and Leader of the Iews. In thoſe dayes Simon camped againſt Gaza, and beſieged it round about, he made alſo an Engine of warre, and ſet it by the City, and battered a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7892:98"/>
Towre and tooke it. And they that were in the Engine, leapt into the City: whereupon there was a great uprore in the City, inſomuch as the people of the City rent their clothes, and climbed upon the walls with their wives and children, and cryed with a loud voice, beſeeching Simon to grant them peace. And they ſaid, Deale not with us according to our wickedneſſe, but according to thy mercy. So Simon was appeaſed towards them, and fought no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, but put them out of the City, and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the houſes wherein the Idols were: and ſo entred into it with ſongs and thankſgiving: yea hee put all uncleanneſſe out of it, and placed ſuch men there as would keepe the Law, and made it ſtronger than it was before, and built therein a dwelling place for himſelfe. They alſo of the Towre of Ieruſalem were kept ſo ſtrait, that they could neither come forth, nor goe into the Countrey, nor buy, nor ſell: wherefore they were in great diſtreſſe for want of victualls, and a great number of them periſhed through famine. Then cried they to Simon, beſeeching him to bee at one with them, which thing hee granted them, and when hee had put them out from thence, hee cleanſed the Towre from pollutions. And entred into it the three and twentieth day of the ſecond moneth, in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſeventieth and one yeare with thankſgiving, and branches of Palm-trees, and with Harpe and Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals, and with Vials and hymnes and ſongs; becauſe there was deſtroyed a great Enemy out of Iſrael. Hee ordained alſo that day ſhould be kept every yeare with gladneſſe. Moreover, the hill of the Temple that was by the Towre, he made ſtronger than it was, and there
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7892:99"/>
hee dwelt himſelfe with his company.</hi> Hee that will compare theſe and many other paſſages in this grave Writer with the ninth of the Prophet <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah,</hi> will perceive there may bee good uſe of books not Canonicall, for the right underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſacred Writings moſt Canonicall; and that this booke though <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be left out in the new impreſſions or bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up of our Bibles. But to returne unto the Prophecie of <hi>Zachariah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The manifeſt accompliſhment of all the ſtrange alterations foretold by him in this ninth <hi>Chapter,</hi> might well occaſion the Jews to expect the comming of their promiſed King ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And amongſt all the ſignes which the times intercurrent betweene <hi>Alexanders</hi> conqueſt of Syria, Tyre, and Paleſtina, and our SAVIOURS death, did exhibit; this to mee is moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that after ſo many terrible blaſts of Gods wrath thus overturning every Caſtle and ſtrong hold about Jeruſalem, ſweeping moſt Cities of their ancient Inhabitants, as the whirle winde doth their ſtreets of duſt; the Temple of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem ſhould all this while hold up her head: that Temple whoſe foundation, and ſuperſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions had been accuſed of ſedition, and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whoſe demolition had been ſolemnly vowed by ſuch Tyrants as had power given them over the City and ſtrong holds of Jeruſalem, power to practice all kinde and maner of ſavage cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on the Citizens bodies, and to expoſe their carkaſſes to the birds of the aire. The conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7892:99"/>
hereof doth plainly teſtifie ſuch a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full arme and watchfull eye of the Almighty to defend his houſe as in the eight <hi>verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is literally charactered. <hi>And I will encampe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my houſe becauſe of the army, becauſe of him that paſſeth by, and becauſe of him that returneth: and no oppreſſor ſhall paſſe through them any more, for now have I ſeene with mine eyes.</hi> Hee that could rightly ſpell the ſeverall paſſages in the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Authors, and the diſpoſition of Divine providence overruling the projects of <hi>Alexander</hi> and his Succeſſors, in all theſe warres according to the literall predictions of the Prophet <hi>Zachary,</hi> and put them right together, could not ſuſpect that which <hi>Ioſephus</hi> hath regiſtred in the latter end of the eleventh Book of Jewiſh antiquities, concerning <hi>Alexanders</hi> reconciliation to <hi>Iaddah</hi> the high Prieſt of the Jews, and the extraordinary favours done unto that Nation, which not long before had mightily offended him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But this prediction of Gods ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in protecting his Temple againſt ſuch as pretended miſchiefe unto it, was literally fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, not onely in the times of <hi>Alexander,</hi> but in the attempts made againſt it by <hi>Nicanor, Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> and other of his profeſſed enemies, though not fully to bee accompliſhed untill the glory of this Temple came. For the Temple built by <hi>Zerubbabel ſub auſpiciis</hi> of <hi>Ieſhue</hi> the high Prieſt, did continue and flouriſh untill JESUS the high Prieſt of the Covenant, into whoſe body the life and ſpirit of it was to be transfuſed, did viſit
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7892:100"/>
and cleanſe it. It muſt be granted that <hi>Herod</hi> the great did take downe the Temple built by <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel,</hi> not with purpoſe to demoliſh it, but to make it more glorious to humane view, than <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> Temple had been. And this friendly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of it, with purpoſe to reedifie it, did prefigure the diſſolution of Chriſts body and ſoule, and their reunition in glory and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. And I could willingly yeeld my aſſent unto <hi>Rupertus</hi> and <hi>Ribera,</hi> that the firſt <hi>verſes</hi> of this <hi>Chapter</hi> were truely fulfilled in that victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous paſſage of the Goſpel throughout the Cities of Syria and Paleſtina before mentioned: So they or their followers would grant me, that the ſwift victory of the Goſpel, was as well occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as portended by <hi>Alexanders</hi> ſpeedy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of theſe Regions. For God did plague theſe neighbour Nations before the deſire of all Nations came unto this Temple, that Jeruſalem might take warning by them, and repent her of her ſinnes. <hi>I have cut off their Nations, their Towers are deſolate: I made their ſtreets waſte, that none paſſeth by: their Cities are deſtroyed; ſo that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant. I ſaid, Surely thou (Ieruſalem) wilt feare mee, thou wilt receive inſtruction, ſo their dwelling ſhould not bee cut off, howſoever I puniſhed them, but they roſe early, and corrupted all their doings,</hi> Zephaniah 3.6, 7. That this Prophecy unto what other times ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be concludently appliable, doth in ſpeciall referre unto the calamities brought upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, is apparent from
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7892:100"/>
                     <hi>Zephan.</hi> 2.4, 5. But to returne to the literall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Prophecie now in handling: <note n="*" place="margin">zach. 9.9</note> that, as I take it, is, as if the Prophet had ſpoken in more words to Jeruſalem thus.
<q>Thine eyes in the generations following ſhall behold the flouriſhing pride of ſundry Nations, each en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to overtop others in height of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and temporall ſtate; each driving to keepe others under by humane policie and ſtrength of warre. And whilſt the ſight of their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Conqueſts ſhall poſſeſſe thy thoughts, thou wilt bee ready in the pride of thy heart to ſay, Jeruſalem and Judah, one day ſhall have their turne, and in that day ſhall the ſonnes of <hi>Iacob,</hi> the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> bee like the Monarchs of Greece or Perſia, farre exalted above the Kings of other Nations: every one (able to beare Armes) gliſtring with his gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſhield, and leading the Princes of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then as priſoners bound in chaines, and their Nobles in fetters of iron. The beauty, and riches of their coſtly Temples ſhall deck the Chariots of my children, which their captives ſhall draw in triumph. But thou ſhouldeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the promiſed Prince of peace, of benignity, and Juſtice, ſhould not bee ſought amongſt the tumultuous hoſts of warre. Or canſt thou hope, that <hi>the deſire of all Nations,</hi> ſhould bee thy Leader or Generall to deſtroy themſelves. It is glory and honour enough for thee; glory and honour greater than the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Conquerer on earth could ever compaſſe,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7892:101"/>
that the King of kings, and Lord of lords, ſhall be anointed and proclaimed King upon the hill of Sion: that the inviolable decrees of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting peace ſhall bee given to all the Nations under heaven from thy Courts. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whilſt horſes and Chariots, or other glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious preparations of warre ſhall preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to thy view, ſuffer them to paſſe as they come, and reſt aſſured that thy King, of whoſe comming thou haſt often beene admoniſhed by the Prophets, is not amongſt them. The maner of his comming unto thee, ſo thou wilt mark it, bodes farre better tidings to thee, and all the Nations beſides, than can accompany the proſperous ſucceſſe of warres, or any victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which is ſtained with blood. What King of Judah or Iſrael did ever levy an Army though in juſt defence of their Countrey and people, on ſo faire termes, that no poore amongſt them were pinched with taxes for the ſupply? What victory did they ever obtaine ſo good cheape, that many of their children were not inforced to ſit downe with loſſe, many wounded, others maymed, and ſome alwayes ſlaine? But loe, now I bring thee unuſuall matter of exultation, and uncouth joy. For behold, <hi>thy King commeth unto thee</hi> (whenſoever he commeth) attended with juſtice for his guide, and ſalvation for his traine. Hee ſhall execute judgement without oppreſſion, hee ſhall ſave thee (ſo thou wilt be ſaved) without deſtroying any; able and ready to make thy lame to goe, to give life to the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7892:101"/>
dead without hazard either of life or limb to any who reſts within thy territories. Such ſhall bee the maner of his comming, and ſuch his preſence, that the ſillieſt wretch amongſt thy children, may think himſelfe more happy, than any King of Judah or Iſrael which was before him; ſo hee will conforme himſelfe to his garb or demeanor. <hi>For hee commeth unto thee poore and lowly, riding upon an Aſſe, and a Colt, the foole of an Aſſe,</hi> to weane thee from the vaine hopes of the Heathen, from which the Prophets have ſo often dehorted thy forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Some put their truſt in horſes, ſome in chariots: <hi>but thy confidence muſt bee in the Lord thy God,</hi> who will alwayes bee thy King to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thee, to protect thee, and ſtrengthen thee, through his weakneſſe. For by the weakneſſe of his appearance, <hi>he will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horſe from Ieruſalem, and the battell bow ſhall bee cut off, and hee ſhall ſpeake peace unto the heathen: His</hi> Dominion ſhall bee from Sea to Sea, and from the River to the ends of the Earth, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.10.</q>
The mark where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the Prophet <hi>Zachariah</hi> in this place aimes, is the very ſame with that which the Prophet <hi>Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai</hi> his coaevall had ſet up a little before him; Neither of them (as I take it) conſcious of the others predictions. <hi>Yet now bee ſtrong, O Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel, ſaith the Lord, and be ſtrong O Ieſhua ſonne of Ioſedech the high Prieſt, and bee ſtrong all the people of the Land, ſaith the Lord, and work, (for I am with you, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts) according to

And the Prophet <hi>Zachariah</hi> had touched (before) on the ſame ſtring, <hi>Chap</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>Sing and rejoyce, O daughter of Sion: for loe, I come and I will dwell in the midſt of thee, ſaith the Lord.

worke, might have taught the Jews, had they not been blinde, to expect that the deſire of all Nation, their promiſed King, was ſpeedily to come unto it: yet not to come in ſuch pomp, ſpecially of warre, as they expected, but in ſuch humility and meekneſſe of ſpirit, as the Prophet <hi>Zachariah</hi> in the ninth <hi>Chapter</hi> and tenth <hi>verſe</hi> hath expreſſed. And ſo, it had been foretold in the building of <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> Temple. <hi>Not by might, nor by power, but by my ſpirit, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.

God by his all-ſeeing providence did prevent the reduction of that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility or facility rather of impoſture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto this Prophecie above others was expoſed, into act. For from the day of our Saviours tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant comming into Jeruſalem, neither City nor people had any juſt occaſion of ſuch joy or exultation as now they expreſt; ſcarce any quiet houre from this neglect of that great ſalvation, which now was profered, untill the deſtruction of the Citie and Temple, and the diſperſion of the Jewiſh Nation throughout the world. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many other circumſtances related by the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7892:103"/>
Evangeliſts, all worthy of our ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this one in my minde is moſt remarkable; that the Owners of the Aſſe and of the Colt, or the neighbourhood then preſent, ſhould ſuffer them to be untied and carried away before they ſaw the Diſciples warrant ſo to doe, ſubſcribed by their Maſters hand. But warrant they had none ſave onely Parroll. <hi>And if any ask why you doe ſo, ſay, The Lord hath need of them, &amp;c.</hi> Matt. 21.3. and <hi>Mark</hi> 11.3. Had not this Lord, whoſe authority they avouched been a greater King than his Father <hi>David</hi>; had not his power and authority, not over their goods onely, but over their mindes and conſciences, been more than Monarchicall: hee could not ſo plainely, and ſo peremptorily have fore-prophecied <hi>de futuris contingentibus,</hi> or given his Diſciples full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that the Owner of theſe <hi>juments</hi> ſhould do, as hee foretold they would doe. This was an Oracle of the ſame God, of the ſame power, and authority, which informed <hi>David,</hi> that the men of Keilah would betray him into <hi>Sauls</hi> hands, if he did commit himſelfe to their truſt. The men of Keilah were prevented from doing that, which the Searcher of all hearts ſaw they were intended or bent to doe. But theſe men did as the Lord foretold they ſhould doe, when they intended no ſuch matter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If wee compare the Evangelicall relations concerning the maner of our Saviours comming to Jeruſalem with the Prophets predictions, they agree ſo well that <hi>Zachariah</hi> in this particular
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7892:104"/>
may ſhare well with <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in that title of the Evangelicall Prophet. Yet in the maner of the Evangelicall Stories concerning this point, there is ſome variation in words, but no contradiction or contrariety in ſenſe. <hi>Goe unto the village</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Matthew) over againſt you. And ſtraight you ſhall finde an Aſſe tied and a Colt with her: looſe them and bring them unto me,</hi> Matt. 21.2. S. <hi>Mark</hi> relateth the ſame ſtory thus; <hi>Yee ſhall finde a Colt tied, whereon neuer man ſate, looſe him and bring him,</hi> Mar. 11.2. See <hi>Luke</hi> 19.30. This variation of words hath raiſed a doubt amongſt Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as well of the Prophet as of the Evangeliſts, whether our Saviour did ride part of the way up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Aſſe, and part upon the Colt, or all the way upon the Colt alone. Such as think our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did ride onely upon the Colt, labour to ſalve the truth of the Propheticall prediction and S. <hi>Matthews</hi> relation, how it was fulfilled by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> uſuall, as they alledge, in the Hebrew Dialect. To ſay the King of Sion ſhould come riding upon an Aſſe, and upon the foale of an Aſſe, is a ſpeech as juſtifiable in grammaticall ſenſe, as that <hi>Ionas</hi> ſhould bee ſleeping in the ſides of the ſhip (ſo are the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie) whereas hee could not ſleepe but in one ſide of the ſhip at one time. But as for <hi>Synecdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, metonymies,</hi> or other like words of Art, gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, or rhetorique, unleſſe they bee reduced to ſome logicall or rational maxime, they edifie no better in Divinity, than an Allegory or myſticall interpretation, which is not grounded upon ſome

The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile though never accuſtomed to the yoke of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaicall Lawes, by whoſe rites the anointing and conſecration, the comming of this great King was foreſhadowed; did beyond expectation wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſubmit himſelfe unto the Goſpel or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven here on earth, as the yong Colt which never had been backt before this time, did gently beare our Saviour, notwithſtanding all the noiſe and cry which had been made by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous multitude.

Arius Montanus</hi> in his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineary referres the ſame pronoune unto the firſt clauſe, <hi>Iuſtus, &amp;c.</hi> But whereas others reade, <hi>Salvator ille,</hi> hee hath it, <hi>Salvatus ipſe:</hi> So doth our former Engliſh, <hi>hee is juſt, and ſaved himſelfe.</hi> But <hi>Cramerus</hi> the Lutheran, <hi>ut Hunnii diſcipulum agnoſcas,</hi> chargeth that Tranſlation which our former Engliſh followes (as his Maſter <hi>Hunnius</hi> had <hi>Calvin</hi> in many others) with Judaizing, at leaſt for giving advantage to the captious Jew. For what argument can it be either of glory to a great King, or of joy unto Subjects, to foretell that he himſelfe ſhould bee <hi>ſervatus</hi> or <hi>ſalvatus.</hi> This expreſſion implies danger unto himſelfe more directly, then ſaving health unto others: it ſuppoſeth perill or hazard <hi>antecedent,</hi> but doth not neceſſarily argue victory for the conſequent. And yet the words in the Originall are formally paſſive. But <hi>Cramerus</hi> with ſome others would out of the grammaticall rudiments which they had learned, inſtruct us, that Verbs of this forme or conjugation ſometimes admit a ſignification meerely active, otherwhiles neither meerely

Yet if the Originall in this place might be (as <hi>Cramerus</hi> would have it) reciprocall, the <hi>baſis</hi> of theſe two contrary ſignifications ſhould bee the paſſive. And though both verſions <hi>ſaving himſelfe,</hi> and <hi>ſaved himſelfe</hi> meet in one point; yet it had been more handſome to have ſaid <hi>ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatus a ſeipſo,</hi> then <hi>ſervans ſeipſum.</hi> And ſo <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablus</hi> in his annotations upon this place tells us, it may bee rendred. <hi>Vertere potes</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>&amp; ſervetur, ſub: a ſe, pro ſervans ſe.</hi> But <hi>Maſius</hi> a man more ſkilfull then the vulgar Grammarians, hath ſo farre impeacht theſe grammaticall curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities about the peculiar force or value of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugations, that it is not ſafe to put a matter of ſo great a conſequence, as the fulfilling of a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie concerning Chriſt, upon their verdict. And however many other Verbs in this forme, to wit, in <hi>Niphal</hi> bee rather equivalent to actives, then truely actives, neuterpaſſives, or reciprocals: yet their uſe though it were more frequent then it is, cannot preſcribe againſt the proper and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſignification of the word <gap reason="foreign">

often labour to ſalve the regular uſe, or impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of words from the diverſity of formes or conjugations in their derivatives, or multiplicity of ſignifications in the primitive, when as all the variation proceeds wholly from the nature of the ſubjects unto which one and the ſame word in one and the ſame forme or ſignification is applied. As for inſtance, when <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> ſaith, <hi>Benedictus ſit Deus Abrahami, &amp; Benedictus ſit Abraham a Deo, &amp;c.

That <hi>Hoſanna</hi> in the intention of the Multitude, which carryed or ſpread branches of Palmes or Olives in the way, ſhould (at leaſt in the direct ſenſe) be meerely congratulatory, is probably alledged from the whole phraſe, or ſtructure of ſpeech: for they did not cry, as the blind man in the way did, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="2">2. Some goe a great way further, and would perſwade us that the people, or multitude being ſory that they had ſo ſleighted our Saviours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, or invitations in the laſt feaſt of Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles (<hi>Iohn</hi> 7.) to which this ſolemnity of carying branches was (at the leaſt) originally proper, did ſeeke to redeeme their former neglect, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the opportunity of tendring their allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance unto him, not as hee was the Sonne of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> onely, but as the God of their Fathers, who had brought them out of Aegypt into the land of Canaan, and redeemed them from Babiloniſh captivity, to honour him with ſolemne feaſts,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7892:112"/>
and other ſervices in Jeruſalem. But that the multitude, (either all, or moſt, or any) ſhould have a more diſtinct explicite apprehenſion of his Deity, or of the great myſtery of ſalvation which hee was now to accompliſh, then his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Followers had, is very improbable. That his very Diſciples (though Actors in this buſineſſe) had no ſuch diſtinct apprehenſion of the great myſtery imported by this ſolemnity, is unqueſtionable. For S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> upon a diſtinct review of all the circumſtances of this Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whether congratulatory, or precatory or both, tells us <hi>Theſe things underſtood not his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples at the firſt, but when Ieſus was glorified, then remembred they that theſe things were written of him, and that they had done theſe things unto him, Chap.</hi> 12.16.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Amongſt the things which are written of him, this was one, that he ſhould be acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and publickely proclaimed for the Sonne of <hi>David,</hi>

                     </gap>, the often promiſed and long expected Meſſias, and Redeemer of the whole world. And all this was acknowledged and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by the multitude, as well by the forme of prayer which they uſed, as by their reall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulations. Firſt that the word <hi>Hoſanna</hi> was uttered by way of prayer by the multitude, is cleare from that paſſage in the Pſalmiſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the word <hi>Hoſanna</hi> with the matters of fact, which did accompany it, doe referre. For ſo it is agreed upon by all ſides, that <gap reason="foreign">

now I beſeech thee, O Lord: O Lord, I beſeech thee, ſend now proſperitie:</hi> to wit, unto the Sonne of <hi>David,</hi> and unto his people by him. And thus farre at leaſt, the apprehenſion or intention of the people, when they cried <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to the Son of <hi>David,</hi> did reach. For they thought this was the day, which the Lord had made; and did therefore rejoyce and were glad in it, as in the day of their long expected redemption from the hands of all their enemies. As they heard theſe things, he added, and ſpake a parable, becauſe he was nigh to Jeruſalem, and becauſe they thought that the kingdome of God ſhould immediately appeare, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.11. This prenotion, that the kingdome of God was now to be manifeſted did facilitate the aſſent or obedience as well of the owner of the Aſſe, and the Colt, whereon hee rode to Jeruſalem, as of the Maſter of the family wherein he did eate his Paſſeover, unto the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation or direction of our great Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. The one ſtory concerning their preſent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, we have <hi>Matt.</hi> 21.5. The other more at large, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.7. to the 14. Nor did they erre in taking this to be the day of their Redemption; but in the confuſed notion of the enemies, from which they were to bee redeemed. They expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted onely a deliverance from the tyranny of the Romans, and other hoſtile Nations, over whom they hoped the Sonne of <hi>David</hi> ſhould exerciſe royall and temporall Juriſdiction. And it is no wonder, if the multitude, whether of inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Jeruſalem or ſtrangers which went out
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:7892:113"/>
to meet him and congratulate his approach, did apprehend no more then thus, ſeeing the two Diſciples which accompanied him toward <hi>Emaus</hi> upon the day of his reſurrection, had no better a notion of the redemption promiſed then this, though even this notion did fleet or vaniſh, after they had ſeene him put to death: <hi>Wee truſted that it had been hee, which ſhould have redeemed Iſrael, Luke</hi> 24.21. This argues, that their former truſt was for the preſent extinguiſhed, till he by ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Scriptures unto them, did revive and kindle it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

Pſalme was firſt written, and at what ſolemne Feaſt it was principally uſed. <hi>Mollerus</hi> a man of commendable paines in this particular ſearch, and one who had read very many, telleth us that the major part of learned Interpreters whom hee had peruſed, are of opinion that this Pſalme was compoſed by <hi>David</hi> himſelfe, upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his victory over his enemies, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from diſturbance or danger from the houſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> upon the death of <hi>Iſhboſheth.</hi> And for ſtrengthening this conjecture, hee referreth us to the 2. of <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. And <hi>Coppen,</hi> a moſt Ingenuous and exact Examiner of ſuch Commentators, as he had read, ſeemeth rather to encline this way, then to the contrary. The maine ſtreame of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters would carry mee with them, did not the nature of the Subject now in hand, permit a
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:7892:115"/>
peculiar liberty of diſſenting from a major part, though otherwiſe moſt learned Interpreters. And hauing conferd this 118. Pſalme as well for circumſtances, as for matter and for the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of ſpeech or language with the hiſtory of the 2. of <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. as with the 18. and 68. Pſalme, which, it is evident, were both written at the time and upon the occaſions, which <hi>Mollerus</hi> conjectures this 118. Pſalme was compoſed; I finde no congruity either of matter or ſtile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them. Many paſſages in the 118. Pſalme there are, which literally referre unto the gates or building of the houſe of the Lord, not to the Ark or Tabernacle, which were onely extant in the time of <hi>David.</hi> For hee lived not to ſee the chiefe corner ſtone, whether the higheſt, or the loweſt of the Temple laid or placed; much leſſe to ſee the gates, at which the righteous was to enter, ſet up. Beſides, although this 118. Pſalme was written by the ſame Spirit, by which <hi>David</hi> wrote; yet the language or character of this Pſalme doth argue, it was compoſed in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent age from that, wherein <hi>David</hi> lived and wrote the 18. and 68. Pſalmes. And as farre, as my obſervation leades mee, in the ſame age and upon the ſame occaſions, that the Pſalmes of degrees (all ſave one) were firſt compoſed and firſt uſed. And thoſe Pſalmes (it is to me cleare) were written after this peoples returne from Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, and, as is moſt probable, after the death of <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> when the glory of the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> was for a time eclipſed by the ſplendor
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:7892:115"/>
of the houſe of <hi>Aaron.</hi> And certainely, if this Pſalme had been compoſed by <hi>David</hi> himſelfe, or any of his Succeſſors, or other Prophet in this Nation, while the firſt Temple was ſtanding, there would have been thankeſgiving in ſpeciall expreſt for the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> as well as for the houſe of <hi>Aaron.</hi> But the forme of thankeſgiving in the firſt place runnes thus; <hi>O give thanks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, for hee is good; becauſe his mercie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for ever. Let Iſrael now ſay, that his mercy endureth for ever. Let the houſe of Aaron now ſay, that his mercy endureth for ever. Let them now that feare the Lord ſay, that his mercy endureth for ever,</hi> Pſal. 118.1, 2, 3, 4. Nor is there any expreſſe mention in ſpeciall, of the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> or of his Succeſſors unto the end of this Pſalme: though many paſſages in the ſame Pſalme cannot according to the true literall ſenſe bee applied to any Perſon or Communitie, ſave onely to the Sonne of <hi>David,</hi> who was alſo <hi>Davids</hi> Lord. The thankſgivings are uttered or delivered not in the name of any one Perſon or Family, but in the name and behalfe of the whole Community, as well Prieſt as people. And yet the ſame thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings are punctually directed unto God the Lord: or as the multitude, not by diſtinct ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of their meaning, but by the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Gods divine providence expound the Pſalme, unto GOD Incarnate, the Sonne of <hi>David.</hi>

Pſalme did contein a peculiar prophecy or teſtimony prophetically typicall of the promiſed Meſſias his comming to Jeruſalem, to ratifie or fulfill whatſoever was foretold or portended by this Solemnity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was firſt uſed: no time, or ſeaſon can with greater probabilitie be allotted, no occaſion more fitly pretended for the firſt compoſing of it, then the extraordinary joy of the whole Communitie of the people of Juda and Iſrael, aſwell Prieſts as Laicks, upon the erection or finiſhing of the ſecond Temple. For within the compaſſe of this ſeaſon, <hi>Haggai</hi> had prophecied that the deſire of all Nations ſhould come unto that Temple. The preciſe time according to exact calculation of his comming to Jeruſalem, and of his death there, had beene notified by <hi>Daniel</hi> not long before. The ſacred hiſtory of the times, wherein <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel, Ieſhua, Haggai,</hi> and <hi>Zechariah</hi> lived, beare plentifull record, that the people of Judah, Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin, or Iſrael had no juſt cauſe, or great occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of rejoycing according to that ſcale of joy and gladneſſe, which is charactered in the 118. Pſalme, immediately after their returne from Babyloniſh captivitie. For both neighbour Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the principal Officers of this ſide Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, of thoſe kings unto whom they were ſubject, did partly by violence, partly by malicious ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions for divers yeares prohibite the erection of the Temple, and the re-edifying of Jeruſalem.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:7892:117"/>
More feare, then joy did poſſeſſe this great peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when they begun to erect the Altar of the Lord, as may appeare from <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.4. And that was divers months before the foundation of the Temple was laid: at which time indeed there was much joy, eſpecially amongſt the people, and younger ſort; Yet joy mixt with many teares of the Ancient, eſpecially Prieſts and Levites, which had ſeene the former Temple, (at leaſt the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it.) <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.12, 13.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 However, it is probable that this 118. Pſalm was in part compoſed upon the ſight or view of the firſt foundation of the ſecond Temple. For <hi>Ezra</hi> tells us that the Prieſts and Levites, after the ordinance of <hi>David</hi> King of Iſrael, ſung toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by courſe in praiſing and giving thanks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, <hi>becauſe he is good, and his mercy endureth for ever toward Iſrael.</hi> And in this forme of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving the 118. Pſalme begins and ends, <hi>O give thanks unto the Lord, for his mercy endureth for ever. Let Iſrael now ſay that his mercy endureth for ever. ver.</hi> 1. <hi>O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. ver.</hi> 29. I am not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull, nor can the Reader be ignorant that there is another Pſalme, <hi>videlicet</hi> 136. in which this forme of praiſe is more perpetuall, as being the cloſe or fall of every verſe. But that Pſalme (as I have many inducements to conceive) was compoſed long before the foundation of the Temple was laid. But other Pſalmes of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving there are beſides theſe two, which were compoſed upon ſpeciall occaſions, and afterwards
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:7892:118"/>
continued in their ſolemne feaſts with further additions, and amplifications, as the like occaſions of publique joy did miniſter. For later Prophets, or men otherwiſe inſpired by the holy Ghoſt for that purpoſe, to interſert, or adde more plaine or fuller expreſſions of <hi>Davids,</hi> or former Prophets intent or meaning in their forme of thankſgiving, or to paraphraſe upon them, was never unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, although they had added the ſame curſe, to ſuch as ſhould adde unto, or diminiſh their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which is annexed unto the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the booke of the Revelations. For no addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is forbidden, but ſuch as includeth a vitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the text, or ſuch as pretendeth Divine au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thority, when it hath it not.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 But however this 118. Pſalme or moſt part of it might be begunne upon the occaſions forementioned by <hi>Ezra</hi>; yet ſome paſſages in it there are, which in particular refer unto ſome one of the three great and anniverſary ſolemnities, as that; <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made, we will rejoyce and be glad in it. Save now O Lord I beſeech thee, &amp;c. ver.</hi> 24, 25. Now after the foundation of the Temple was laid, there was no ſolemn feaſt, in which this peoples expreſſion of joy and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving was ſo remarkeable or ſo peremptorily required, as in that feaſt of Tabernacles or booths recorded by <hi>Nehemiah, cap.</hi> 8.

This part of that great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity had not beene obſerved from the daies of <hi>Ioſhua</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Nun,</hi> untill <hi>Nehemiah</hi> had put his peremptory commiſſion for re-edifying Jeruſalem, in execution. <hi>Nehemiah which is the Tirſhatha, and Ezra the Prieſt the Scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, ſaid unto all the people; This day is holy unto the Lord your God, mourne not, nor weepe: for all the people wept, when they heard the words of the Law, &amp;c. And they found written in the Law, which the Lord had commanded by Moſes, that the Children of Iſrael ſhould dwell in boothes in the feaſt of the ſeventh month. And that they ſhould pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and proclaime in all their Cities, and in Ieruſalem, ſaying, Goe forth unto the Mount, and fetch Olive branches and pine branches and myrtle branches and Palme branches and branches of thick trees to make booths. So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themſelves booths, every one upon the roofe of his houſe, and in their courts, and in the courts of the houſe of God, and in the ſtreet of the water gate of Ephraim. And all the congregation of them that were come againe out of the captivity, made boothes, and ſate under the boothes: for ſince the dayes of Ioſhua the ſonne of Nun, unto that day, had not the Children of Iſrael done ſo, and there was very great gladneſſe.

And they kept the feaſt ſeven dayes, and on the eighth day was a ſolemne Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly according unto the manner,</hi> Nehem. 8.9, 10, 11. &amp;c. This great day of the feaſt was that anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary ſolemnity, wherein our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, after the revolution of many years (how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny I leave to the calculation of Chronologers;) did make that ſolemne proclamation unto the people aſſembled at the feaſt of Tabernacles, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.37. <hi>In the laſt day, that great day of the feaſt, Ieſus ſtood and cryed, ſaying, If any man thirſt, let him come unto me, and drink. He that beleeveth on mee, (as the Scriptures have ſaid) out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of running water. But this ſpake he of the Spirit, which they that beleeve on him, ſhould receive.

                  <p n="7">7 It is very obſervable, which is recorded by Saint <hi>Iohn, Chap.</hi> 7.14. <hi>That about the midſt of the feaſt, Ieſus went into the temple and taught: and ſo taught, that the Iews marveiled, ſaying, How knoweth this man letters ſeeing he never learned?</hi> But to my apprehenſion, it is more obſervable, and wanteth not a myſtery (though for the preſent I cannot ſound it;) why our Saviour ſhould begin to teach in the Temple in the midſt of the feaſt, not from the firſt day untill the laſt, as <hi>Ezra</hi> the Prieſt and Scribe had done in the ſame feaſt mentioned by <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> His friends and kinsfolkes had adviſed him to be at Jeruſalem to ſhew himſelfe at the beginning of the feaſt: <hi>Now the Iews feaſt of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:7892:119"/>
was at hand. His Brethren therefore ſaid unto him, Depart hence, and goe unto Iudea, that thy Diſciples alſo may ſee the works which thou doeſt. For there is no man that doth any thing in ſecret, and he himſelfe ſeeketh to be knowne openly· If thou doſt theſe things, ſhew thy ſelf unto the world, &amp;c. Then Ieſus ſaid unto them, My time is not yet come; but your time is alwaies ready, &amp;c. Goe yee up unto this feaſt. I goe not up yet unto this feaſt, for my time is not yet come. When he had ſaid theſe words unto them, he abode ſtill in Galilee.</hi> Howbeit after his teaching three or foure daies at the leaſt, and his ſolemne invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all men to come unto him in the great day of the feaſt; he was not publickly acknowledged for the Chriſt; but ſo acknowledged by ſome, and with demurre or contradiction of others, <hi>Then the Iews ſought him at the feaſt, and ſaid, Where is he? And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him. For ſome ſaid, hee is a good man; Others ſaid, nay, but he deceiveth the people. Howbeit no man ſpake openly of him, for feare of the Iews. John</hi> 7.11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this verdict of him, was given up before he taught in the Temple. After which time their ſuffrages varied, not onely one from another, but from themſelves. For upon that part of doctrine which hee delivered from the 15. verſe to the 25. <hi>Some of them of Ieruſalem ſaid, Is not this he whom they ſeeke to kill? But lo, hee ſpeaketh boldly, and they ſay nothing unto him: Do the Rulers know indeed, that this is the very Chriſt? Howbeit we know this man, whence hee is: But when Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, no man knoweth whence he is. Then cryed Ieſus
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:7892:120"/>
in the Temple, as he taught, ſaying, Ye both know me, and whence I am, and I am not come of my ſelf, but he that hath ſent me is true, whom ye know not. But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath ſent mee. Then they ſought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, becauſe his houre was not yet come. And many of the people beleeved on him, and ſaid, when Chriſt commeth, will he doe more miracles then theſe, which this man hath done? Iohn</hi> 7.25. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in the great and laſt day of the feaſt, many of the people, after they had heard his ſolemne invitation, ſaid, <hi>Of a truth, this is the Prophet: Others ſaid, this is the Chriſt. But ſome ſaid, Shall Chriſt come out of Galilee? Hath not the Scripture ſaid, that Chriſt commeth of the ſeed of David, and out of the town of Bethleem, where Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid was? So there was a diviſion among the people, becauſe of him. And ſome of them would have taken him, but no man laid hands on him. ver.</hi> 40, 41, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For when the chief Prieſts, and Phariſees aſked of the Officers, whom they had employed upon the demurr or debatement of the people to attach him, verſe 32. <hi>Why have ye not brought him?</hi> The onely anſwer they could get, was this, <hi>Never man ſpake like this man.</hi> verſe 45 46.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 But however, in this great feaſt he ſuffered ſuch contradictions of ſinfull men, open contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions one to another, and ſecret contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in moſt individuals to their owne conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For as he had told them <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.28. <hi>That they both knew him, and whence he was, and that he came not of himſelf.</hi> Albeit their paſſions would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them ſo to acknowledge him. Yet his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:7892:120"/>
for the preſent, was not ſo harſh and churliſh (at the peoples hand eſpecially) as it was at the next ſolemne feaſt, in which he againe did publiſh his Commiſſion, to wit, in the feaſt of the <hi>Encoenia</hi> or dedication of the Temple, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately enſuing the forementioned feaſt of Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles. <hi>There was a diviſion</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn) again among the Iews for theſe ſayings. And many of them ſaid, He hath a devill, and is mad: why heare ye him? Others ſaid, theſe are not the words of him that hath a devill. Can a devill open the eyes of the blind? And it was at Ieruſalem the feaſt of the Dedication, and it was winter. And Ieſus walked in the Temple in Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons porch. Then came the Iews round about him, and ſaid unto him, How long doſt thou make us doubt? If thou be the Chriſt, tell us plainly. Ieſus anſwered them, I told you, and ye beleeved me not. The works that I doe in my Fathers name, they bear witneſſe of me, &amp;c. Ioh</hi>: 10.19, 20, &amp;c. Upon this avouchment, that God was his Father, and that hee and his Father were one, the Jews took up ſtones to ſtone him. <hi>Ieſus anſwered them, many good works have I ſhewed from my Father: for which of theſe works do ye ſtone mee? The Iews anſwered him, ſaying, For a good work we ſtone thee not; but for blaſphemy, and becauſe that thou being a man makeſt thy ſelfe a God. But he eſcaped out of their hands, and went away againe beyond Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, into the place, where Iohn at firſt baptized. And there he abode, and many reſorted unto him, and ſaid, Iohn did no miracle, but all things that Iohn ſpake of this man were true. And many beleeved on him there. verſe</hi> 39, 40, &amp;c. more then had done at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:7892:121"/>
unto which hee did not come, till the great and laſt feaſt of the Paſſeover, albeit he were invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or adviſed to repaire thither, rather then to remaine in <hi>Herods</hi> dominions. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.31. <hi>Then came certaine Phariſees</hi> (Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, or their Complices) <hi>ſaying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence for Herod will kill thee. And he ſaid unto them, Goe, tell that foxe, &amp;c. It cannot be, that a Prophet periſh out of Ieruſalem, &amp;c.</hi> verſe 33. He fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally reſolves them, <hi>Yee,</hi> (to wit) <hi>of Ieruſalem, Behold your houſe is left unto you deſolate: Yee ſhall not ſee me untill the time come, when ye ſhall ſay, Bleſſed is he that commeth in the Name of the Lord. verſe</hi> 35. And after this manner hee was ſaluted by Men, Women, and Children: by all ſorts (unleſſe it were the Scribes and Phariſees) at his comming to this great and laſt Paſſeover, whereof I now treate. However their crucifying of him ſome few daies after, whom they acknowledged for their Lord and Meſſias, did both deſerve and portend that utter deſolation of City and Temple, which hee had foretold in the words immediately going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>O Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem, which killeſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſtoneſt them that are ſent unto thee; how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten would I have gathered thee, &amp;c. Behold your houſe is left unto you deſolate.</hi> But of the full importance of theſe words, I have delivered my opinion elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where more at large. That Chriſt after the feaſt of the Dedication mentioned <hi>Iohn</hi> 10, did remain where <hi>Iohn</hi> at firſt baptized, untill ſome few daies before the Paſſeover; is cleare from that remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtory concerning the raiſing of <hi>Lazarus</hi> from
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7892:121"/>
death. <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.1. &amp;c. <hi>When he had heard therefore that he was ſick, he abode two daies ſtill in the ſame place, where he was. Then after that, ſaith he to his Diſciples, Let us goe into Iudea againe. His Diſciples ſay unto him, Maſter, the Iews of late ſought to ſtone thee; and goeſt thou thither againe? Ieſus anſwered, Are there not twelve houres in the day? If any man walke in the day, he ſtumbleth not; becauſe he ſeeth the light of the world. But if a man walk in the night, he ſtumbleth, becauſe there is no light in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9 It is obſervable, that immediately before, or in the time of theſe great and ſolemne feaſts, his fame was publiſhed for ſome rare miracle. <hi>When Chriſt commeth</hi> (ſaith the people) in the feaſt of Tabernacles, <hi>will he doe more miracles then this man hath done? Iohn</hi> 7.31. The late miracle which occaſioned the contradiction or variety of opinion at the feaſt of the Dedication of the Temple, was the reſtoring of one, who had beene blind from his birth, to perfect ſight. You have the ſtory at large <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. The laſt and greateſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, which he did about Jeruſalem immediately before this laſt Paſſeover, and that which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned him to be proclaimed the Chriſt, not by himſelfe as at other times, nor by his Diſciples onely, but by the unanimous conſent of that migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Aſſembly, beſides the Prieſts and Scribes and Phariſees, was the raiſing of <hi>Lazarus</hi> to life after he had beene foure daies dead. And thus farre I can aſſent unto ſome moderne Writers, that the Multitude then aſſembled, eſpecially the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers did purpoſely ſeeke at this feaſt to redeeme

                  <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Rom the Evangelicall hiſtory of our Saviours appearances at the ſolemn Feaſt celebrated at Jeruſalem, and from the debates betweene his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, eſpecially in the laſt yeere of his preſence there; the Intelligent Reader will eaſily collect without further aduertiſment, that it was a common <hi>prenotion</hi> or received opinion amongſt this people, that their expected Meſſias ſhould bee manifeſted or acknowledged at ſome one or other of their anniverſary Feaſts; of which the Paſſeover was the principall, or (as <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> with ſome other of the Ancients inſtile it) <hi>Metropolitan.</hi> But in which of theſe three ſolemne Feaſts, the Sonne of <hi>David</hi> ſhould be proclaimed King, and made (by God) their Lord, and Chriſt, was if not to all, yet to moſt of them, even to his followers (whether Apoſtles or Diſciples) uncertaine, untill the event did determine the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:7892:122"/>
doubt unto ſuch of them, as God did grant eyes to ſee, and eares to heare, and hearts to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the myſteries of ſalvation; <hi>reſpectively pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured</hi> by theſe three ſolemne Feaſts, and really accompliſht in this great Feaſt of the Paſſeover, wherein they crucified JESUS of NAZARETH (their late proclaimed King,) and in the Feaſt of Pentecoſt next following. The full intent, and purport of this laſt obſervation, as well the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, as negative part, to wit, [<hi>the certainetie that hee was to bee proclaimed King at ſome one of thoſe Feaſts: and the uncertainety at which of thoſe hee ſhould be ſo proclaimed</hi>] is included in thoſe words of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> before cited to another purpoſe; <hi>Theſe things underſtood not his Diſciples at the firſt</hi>; that is, they did not lay them to heart, nor right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehend the melodious harmony betweene the ſolemnity of that time, and the events fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pictured by that, and other ſolemnities. <hi>But when Ieſus was glorified, then remembred they that theſe things were written of him, and that they had done theſe things unto him, Chap.</hi> 12.16. that is, they firſt conſidered, and then remembred, that his glorious exaltation was foretold, typically prefigured by that ſolemne Feaſt, and really ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the multitude.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the ſolemnity of dwelling in booths, uſed in the Feaſt of Tabernacles, or the exigence or occaſion in whoſe remembrance that Feaſt was inſtituted (which was their ſpeciall reliefe from extremity of heat and thirſt in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;) had ſpeciall reference to the Feaſt of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt:
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:7892:123"/>
is too apparent to be contradicted by any good Chriſtian, from that of our Saviour, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.37. <hi>In the laſt day, that great day of the Feaſt</hi> (to wit, of the Tabernacles) <hi>Ieſus ſtood, and cried, ſaying, If any man thirſt, &amp;c. This ſpake hee of the Spirit, which they that beleeve on him ſhould receive. For the holy Ghoſt was not yet given, becauſe that Ieſus was not yet glorified.</hi> But ſhortly after his glorification, the Spirit of God, the true water of life, was powred out more plentifully upon all fleſh capable of it, then water had been unto Iſrael in their extremity of thirſt in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; or then that water, which was uſed (I know not whether by precept or tradition) to be powred out upon the Altar in the Feaſt of Tabernacles, eſpecially upon that great day of the Feaſt, wherein our Saviour ſpake theſe words. But in what place of Scripture it was foreſignified, that waters ſhould flow out of their bellies that beleeved on him, is not pertinent to our preſent purpoſe. Gods ſpeciall protection, not of Iſrael onely according to the fleſh, but of his univerſall Church from ſpirituall enemies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadow of his wings, was more peculiar then the Palme trees or Willows of the brook, or boothes made of them, could afford to the ſonnes of <hi>Iacob,</hi> againſt the parching heat of the Sunne, after our Saviour was glorified. As for thoſe words forecited, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.43. <hi>I made the children of Iſrael to dwell in boothes, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt:</hi> they referre (if good Writers be not miſtaken) to <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.37. <hi>The
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:7892:123"/>
children of Iſrael journeyed from Rameſes to Succoth</hi>; that is a place of boothes, or Tabernacles, or as to a Northerne Borderer might be more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, <hi>to a</hi> place of Shields or Summer houſes. Yet (if I be not miſtaken) the forecited place of <hi>Leviticus</hi> concerning the occaſion of inſtituting the Feaſt of Tabernacles or Shields hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence alſo to that of <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.27. <hi>And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Palme trees, and they encamped there by the waters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Out of the former diſcuſſion it is apparent, that the feaſt of Tabernacles had reference unto the feaſt of Pentecoſt, and that the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of carnall rejoycing in that feaſt, were ſpiritually accompliſhed in the Pentecoſt next following our Saviours paſſion. But what ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall reference had the ſame feaſt of Tabernacles unto the ſolemnity of the Paſſeover? Surely the ſame, which other ſolemne feaſts of the Seuenth moneth (which was a moneth of legall ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,) had. Now that the feaſt of Atonement or Expiation, which was the tenth day of that moneth, (next after the feaſt of Trumpets, and ſome foure dayes before the feaſt of Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles) was punctually accompliſht at the feaſt of the Paſſeover, wherein our Saviour was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; <hi>Maldonat</hi> himſelfe, the moſt rigid Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of the harmony betwixt theſe ſolemnities, and the laſt feaſt of this Paſſeover, would not have denied, if this interrogatory had been put unto him. It is true, that the myſteries fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:7892:124"/>
at this Feaſt by the ſcape Goat, by the waſhing of the high Prieſt, and by ſome other Ceremonies, were fulfilled <hi>in die ſuo,</hi> that is upon the tenth day of the ſeventh moneth, in which our Saviour (as with the conſent of beſt moderne Writers I have elſewhere obſerved <note n="*" place="margin">See Chriſts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to <hi>Iohn.</hi>
                     </note>) was baptized. But for the myſteries prefigured by the Sacrifices, whoſe blood was brought into the Sanctuary upon the tenth of the ſeventh mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; theſe were not accompliſht, untill the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of our Redeemer CHRIST JESUS, into the moſt Holy place, was viſibly ſignified by the rending of the Vaile in the Temple. It is moſt true againe, that the legall feaſts of Trumpets, which was the firſt ſolemnity of the ſeaventh moneth, was Evangelically fulfilled by S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſts</hi> Proclamation and Baptiſme in the beginning of the ſame moneth. But as for the feaſt of Tabernacles, albeit the ſolemnity thereof was in part fulfilled at our Saviours ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and Proclamation of his celeſtiall Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage by himſelfe, upon the great day of that Feaſt, as was but now obſerved: Yet the full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the ſolemnities then uſed, or of the myſteries prefigured by their publique re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in that feaſt eſpecially, was not exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, untill our Saviours triumphant ingreſſe into Jeruſalem foure dayes before the feaſt of the Paſſeover, wherein hee ſuffered for us. Many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the multitude, at the feaſt of Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles immediatly before, did acknowledge him for the expected Meſſias, or for the Prophet,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:7892:124"/>
whom God had promiſed to raiſe up amongſt them like unto <hi>Moſes.</hi> None of them then did either out of expreſſe apprehenſion of his Deity, or by Emblematicall ſignifications of their alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance unto him, acknowledge or proclaime him to be the God of their Fathers, who had ſpoken to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the wilderneſſe: or that very God, unto whoſe honour, the feaſt of Tabernacles was firſt inſtituted, and ſo continued to their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. This acknowledgement was firſt made (though unwittingly) by the multitude, which came to greet his welcome, when he came from Bethany to Jeruſalem over the Mount Olivet. But how was hee at that time (though unwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly) ſo acknowledged by the multitude?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Although man bee a reaſonable and proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Creature; yet the cunningeſt contrivances of wiſeſt men, are alwayes moderated by the Al-ſeeing wiſedome of their Creator. And the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of their projects, although they reach unto, or hit the mark propoſed by them, doe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten glance or fall upon ſome other Object, then they thought of. And oftentimes, as well the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, as contrivance for its execution, are put upon them by ſecret inſtinct. As in that good woman, which powred the precious oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on our Saviours head, whileſt hee ſat at meat in the houſe of <hi>Simon</hi> the Leper. <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.7. Few I thinke upon good conſideration, will ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any further intent, then a longing deſire to teſtifie her love, her loyalty, and obſervance of him, as a gracious man and a ſpeciall Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:7892:125"/>
Yet in the diſpoſition of Divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, working in her by ſecret inſtinct, to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie her love rather in this kinde, then in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſhee did exhibite an undoubted preſage of his death and buriall approaching, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelfe interprets the fact: <hi>When his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſaw it, they had indignation, ſaying, To what purpoſe is this waſte? for this ointment might have been ſold for much, and given to the poore. When Ieſus underſtood it, he ſaid unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for ſhee hath wrought a good work upon mee. For yee have the poore alwayes with you, but me yee have not alwayes. For in that ſhee hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this ointment on my body, ſhe did it for my buriall. Verily I ſay unto you, whereſoever this Goſpel ſhall bee preached in the whole world, there ſhall alſo this, that this woman hath done, bee told for a memoriall of her,</hi> Matth. 26.8, 9, 10, &amp;c. As he was willing to receive the accuſtomed funerall rites of his Countrey, at this womans hands, before his death: ſo was it his pleaſure to have his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation over the kingdome of <hi>David,</hi> the Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his glorious Temple, his triumph ouer the grave, death, and hell, ſolemnely celebrated, before his reſurrection from the dead. For it was lawfull for this Lion of <hi>Iuda</hi> to triumph over death, before the victory, which was to bee pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by his death. The honour done unto him at this ſolemnity, and the ſeverity of his ſentence againſt Jeruſalem in the midſt of this Jubilee, (me thinks) exhibits ſuch a glimpſe of his ſecond appearance in Majeſty unto judgement, as the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:7892:125"/>
transfiguration on the Mount did of his glory, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his reſurrection. Hee had told the Jews, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.23. <hi>As the Father raiſeth up the dead, and quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them: Even ſo the Sonne quickeneth whom hee will. For the Father judgeth no man, but hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all judgement unto the Sonne: that all men ſhould honour the Sonne, even as they honour the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Hee that honoureth not the Sonne, honoureth not the Father which hath ſent him.</hi> A full proofe of his power to pierce the monuments by his word, and to make the graves give up their dead; had been a few dayes before this ſolemnity, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in his raiſing of <hi>Lazarus:</hi> which as was before obſerved, did ſpecially occaſion the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude aſſembled at Jeruſalem to meet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate him, not as the Sonne of <hi>David</hi> onely, but as <hi>Davids</hi> Lord. For, greater honour (though they intended not ſo much) had not been done, either by <hi>David</hi> before the Ark of the Lord, or by their Forefathers unto God himſelfe in the feaſt of Tabernacles.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That the feaſt of Tabernacles was a feaſt of joy, inſtituted to the honour of that God, who had redeemed Iſrael from Aegyptian bondage, who had protected them in Succoth, and in the wilderneſſe in their whole journey towards Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan; is a point unqueſtionable either amongſt good Chriſtians or malignant Jews. That the carying of Palme branches in triumphant maner, ſkipping, dancing, or ſinging, was the peculiar character or expreſſion of that joy, wherewith this people was commanded to rejoyce before the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:7892:126"/>
Lord their God in this feaſt of Tabernacles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others, may bee ratified by the tradition and practiſe of the Jews, whilſt they had liberty, and opportunity to celebrate this feaſt, eſpecially from <hi>Nehemiah</hi> his time. And in aſmuch as the great multitude aſſembled at the feaſt of Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, wherein our Saviour did accompliſh the lawes and rites of the Paſchall lamb; did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him with this kinde of honour accuſtomed in the feaſt of Tabernacles: they evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto the world, though not by expreſſe confeſſion, or diſtinct apprehenſion of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Deity (as was ſaid before;) yet by geſture, and deportment put upon them by ſecret inſtinct, that this JESUS whom they thus welcommed in the Mount of Olives, was that very God and Lord of hoaſts, who had given them victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoaſt in the red Sea, who had protected them and refreſhed them in the wilderneſſe in all their diſtreſſes, and in their whole journey to the land of Canaan: that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry onely God in memory of whoſe gracious goodneſſe towards them, the feaſt of Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles was firſt inſtituted by <hi>Moſes,</hi> afterward more ſolemnely celebrated by <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> and upon ſome interruption in matter of ceremonies, revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or reſtored by <hi>Nehemiah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. As for the doctrine of the later Jews (ſuch I meane, as from our Saviours time, have recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the practice of their Forefathers in this feaſt of Tabernacles;) I referre the ingenuous Reader to the Commentators upon <hi>Leviticus</hi> 23.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:7892:126"/>
and upon <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> The garb and geſture of the Jews in bearing of Palme branches at the feaſt of Tabernacles, (if wee may beleeve theſe mens relations;) was not much unlike the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment of the ancient Grecians after victory, whether in ſerious warres or in Olympick games: or rather the deportment of the ancient Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans was by ſuperſtitious imitation borrowed from the lawes, and cuſtomes of the ancient He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews. The practice of the Grecians, and moſt other Nations in their victories is recorded by <hi>Pauſanias.</hi>

The feaſt of the Dedication, or <hi>Encaenia</hi> in the ninth moneth heretofore handled in part, was a Feaſt inſtituted in imitation of the feaſt of Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, whoſe anniverſary celebration was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly and peremptorily commanded by God himſelfe; <hi>Moſes</hi> at that time being his ſole A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent or Ambaſſadour: whereas the feaſt of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication or <hi>Encenia</hi> was inſtituted by the viſible Church at a time, wherein there was no Prophet
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:7892:128"/>
in Iſrael, no man endued with the ſpirit of <hi>Moſes</hi>; nor no immediat or extraordinary Revelation from God. For a little before the inſtitution of the feaſt of Dedication, the Author of the 74. Pſalme had thus complained; <hi>Wee ſee not our ſignes, there is no more any Prophet, neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.</hi> And this Pſalme, as beſt Interpreters are of opinion, was compoſed in the time of <hi>Antiochus</hi> his raging tyranny over Jeruſalem, over the people of God, and his Temple. Both parts of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation may be confirmed by the Author of the firſt Book of <hi>Maccabees; Then Iudas appointed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine men to fight againſt thoſe that were in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe, untill hee had cleanſed the Sanctuary. So hee choſe Prieſts of blameleſſe converſation, ſuch as had pleaſure in the Law: Who cleanſed the Sanctuarie, and bare out the defiled ſtones into an uncleane place. And when as they conſulted what to doe with the Altar of burnt offerings which was profaned; they thought it beſt to pull it downe, leſt it ſhould bee a reproach to them, becauſe the Heathen had defiled it. Wherefore they pulled it downe, and laid up the ſtones in the Mountaine of the Temple, in a convenient place, untill there ſhould come a Prophet to ſhew what ſhould bee done with them,</hi> 1. Maccab. 4.41, 42. &amp;c. And after they had cleanſed the Sanctuary, they reſtored the holy veſſells, and furniſht the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord. <hi>On the five and twentieth day of the ninth Moneth (which is called the Moneth Caſleu) in the hundred forty, and eighth yeare, they aroſe up betimes in the morning, and offered ſacrifices ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:7892:128"/>
to the Law upon the new Altar of burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, which they had made. Looke at what time, and what day the Heathen had prophaned it, even in that day it was dedicated with ſongs, with citherns, and harps, &amp;c. ver.</hi> 52. <hi>Moreover Iudas and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren with the whole Congregation of Iſrael ordained that the dayes of the Dedication of the Altar ſhould be kept in their ſeaſon from yeare to yeare by the ſpace of eight dayes from the</hi> 25. <hi>day of the moneth Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleu with mirth and gladneſſe,</hi> ver. 59. The maner of celebrating this Feaſt, is more fully expreſt by the Author of the ſecond Booke of <hi>Maccabees Chap.</hi> 10.5, 6, <hi>&amp;c. Vpon the ſame day that the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers profaned the Temple, on the very ſame day, it was cleanſed againe, even the</hi> 25. <hi>day of the ſame moneth, which is Caſleu. And they kept</hi> 8. <hi>dayes with gladneſſe, as in the feaſt of Tabernacles; remembring that not long before they had held the feaſt of Tabernacles, when as they wandred in the mountaines and dennes like beaſts. Therefore they bare branches, and faire boughes and Palmes alſo, and ſang Pſalmes unto him that had given them good ſucceſſe in cleanſing his Temple.</hi> They alſo ordained by a common De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that every yeare thoſe dayes ſhould be kept of the whole Nation of the Jews.

So farre was he from cenſuring ſacred ſolemnities, though not immediately inſtituted by God but by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary authority of the viſible Church: ſo long as their inſtitutions did not vitiat, but rather enlarge their laws and ceremonies regiſtred by <hi>Moſes</hi> (or to uſe the phraſe of the Hebrew Rabbins) did not contradict the ſtations of Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> For he came to Jeruſalem at this feaſt (though cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in the Winter) and taught the people, not to take the ſolemnitie for a will worſhip, but to expound the true intent and prefigurations of it, to try whether they would acknowledge him to be that God who had given their fore-Elders good ſucceſſe in cleanſing the Altar and Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, from the pollutions of the heathen. But ſo far was his owne people from acknowledging thus much, that they tooke up ſtones to throw at him for his Doctrine. Yet at the feaſt of the Paſſeover next enſuing, they did by matter of fact or Emble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall expreſſions of their loyalty towards him (being thereunto led by ſecret inſtinct beyond their actuall apprehenſion) acknowledge him for their very God, who had given them victory over <hi>Antiochus,</hi> over <hi>Gorgias,</hi> and other reliques of his malicious Aſſociats or inſtruments. For thus much their bearing of branches of Palmes, of Olives, or other trees uſed in the honour of God, at the feaſt of Dedication, or that other of Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:7892:129"/>
and their crying <hi>Hoſanna</hi> unto him did concludently import by way of ſuch benigne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of their meaning, as loving Fathers make of their liſping childrens expreſſions, or other ſignifications of their deſires by bodily and viſible geſture, though not by articulate voice. Immediately after hee had in the ſubſtance of man received from them thoſe honorary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, which were due to God alone, he went into the Temple to cleanſe and purifie it from the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Money changers or Merchandiſers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with upon politick pretences or ſophiſmes of ſtate for preſent gaine, it was at this time no leſſe polluted by the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> then it had been by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> or other heathens before the feaſt of the Dedication was inſtituted. Once before, (as we read <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.) he had reformed the like abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but then in the Name and Authority of his Father: but now he viſits the ſame Temple, and gives ſentence in his owne Name, <hi>It is written,</hi> (not my Fathers houſe, but) <hi>my houſe ſhall be called the houſe of prayer, but yee have made it a denne of Theeves.</hi> Mat. 21.13.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 This ſecond reformation, he executed ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily, that the chiefe Prieſts and Elders of the people came the next morning into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as he was teaching, and demanded of him, <hi>By what authority doſt thou theſe things</hi>? Mat. 21.23. To this queſtion he anſwers onely by a croſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatory, unto which they could not reply; <hi>I will ask you alſo one thing, which if ye tell mee, I likewiſe will tell you, by what authority I doe theſe

things: The baptiſme of Iohn, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reaſoned among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſaying, If we ſhall ſay from heaven, he will ſay unto us, why did yee not then beleeve him? But if we ſhall ſay of men, wee feare the people: for all held Iohn as a Prophet. And they anſwered Ieſus and ſaid, We cannot tell. And he ſaid unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I doe theſe things.</hi> If they had (as their conſciences did ſuggeſt unto them) acknowledged the Baptiſme of <hi>Iohn</hi> to have been from heaven, they muſt withall have acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to have beene the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of Mankinde; to have deſcended from heaven truly heavenly; not the Sonne of <hi>David</hi> onely, but the true Sonne of God, their Lord, and God; as the little children the Evening before (though not perhaps by expreſſe apprehenſion) had proclaimed him: and ſo proclaimed him that the chief Prieſts and Scribes could not contradict his moſt divine expoſition of their meaning, or rather of the Pſalmiſt, whoſe propheticall hymne God had appointed them now to act; <hi>When the chief Prieſts</hi> (ſaith Saint Matthew) <hi>ſaw the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things that he did, and the children crying in the Temple and ſaying,</hi> Hoſanna <hi>to the Sonne of</hi> David; <hi>they were ſore diſpleaſed, and ſaid unto him, Heareſt thou, what theſe ſay</hi>? As if they had thus meant, Wee ſee thou art ready to play at ſmall games, rather then ſit out, being thus content to ſolace thy ſelf with the applauſe of little children, which know not what they ſay: as lately thou didſt with the congratulations of Idiots and Fiſhermen

thy followers. But children and fooles (ſuch as they accounted our Saviours followers) doe oft times ſpeak the very truth: and he who was truth it ſelf, doth juſtifie theſe little children, as Gods Ambaſſadors for this purpoſe. For ſo he replies, <hi>Yea, have ye</hi> (who boaſt ſo much of your ſkill in Scripture) <hi>never read, Out of the mouthes of babes and ſucklings thou haſt perfected praiſe</hi>? And he left them as ſilent for any matter of juſt reply, as hee had done their father the Devill, when hee ſent him away with that <hi>Item</hi> or <hi>Scriptum eſt, Avoid Sathan: for it is written, thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the malice of theſe chief Prieſts and Scribes did in the next morning revive, yet the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny alledged by him in juſtification of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, was ſo pregnantly concludent of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that Sathan himſelf had he beene preſent, could not have reply'd unto it.</p>

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:7892:133"/>
delivered my minde at large. And if if it ſhall pleaſe the Lord God to grant mee life and health; what I have either uttered in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or otherwayes conceived concerning this Argument, ſhall be communicated to this Church wherein I live, (if not to others) in the Article of the Catholique Church, which did beginne to bee on earth from our Saviours reſurrection, or from his aſcenſion into heaven and deſcending of the Holy Ghoſt. At the accompliſhment of the Legall Paſſeover by the inſtitution of the grand myſtery or Sacrament prefigured by it; our Lord and Saviour was betrayed by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull friend and ſervant <hi>Iudas,</hi> yet by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition conſecrated to bee that Lamb of GOD, which the Paſchall Lamb did prefigure; that Lamb of God, which was to take away the ſinnes of the world, of which ſinnes the annuall offering of the Paſchall Lamb, or other legall Sacrifices whatſoever, were but anniverſary commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or remembrances that ſinne did ſtill reigne thorowout the world. The treaſon of <hi>Iudas</hi> was expreſly foretold, (and perhaps prefigured by treaſon practiſed againſt the Pſalmiſt) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.9. <hi>Yea, mine owne familiar friend, in whom I truſted, which did eate of my bread, hath lift up his heele againſt mee.</hi> By whom, or upon what occaſion ſoever, this Pſalme was compoſed, certaine it is, the Pſalmiſt according to the literall and hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſenſe did act his owne part with ſenſible fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of preſent infirmities, which did myſtically prefigure more juſt occaſions, which the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:7892:134"/>
Meſſias ſhould have to take up the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint. <hi>Iudas</hi> did eate of his bread: did ſwallow the very ſoppe, which was prepared for himſelfe at that very time, when by the inſtigation of the Devill, hee reſolved to betray him. So that this Pſalme (as hath been obſerved before) was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in CHRIST both according to the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and the moſt punctuall exquiſite literall ſenſe. So was that other complaint, whether of the ſame Pſalmiſt, or of ſome other; <hi>For it is not an open enemy that hath done mee this diſhonour: for then I could have borne it. Neither was it mine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarie that did magnifie himſelfe againſt mee: for then peradventure I would have hid my ſelfe from him. But it was even thou my companion, my guide, and mine owne familiar friend. We took ſweet coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell together: and walked in the houſe of God as friends,</hi> Pſalm. 55.12, 13, &amp;c. <hi>Iudas</hi> had often ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied our Saviour whilſt hee taught in the Temple, but eſpecially at this laſt feaſt of the Paſſeover, wherein hee did for foure dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther frequent the Temple, from morning till evening, diſputing with the learned, and cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing the vulgar and ignorant. And our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to notifie this Prophecie to be exactly fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by <hi>Iudas,</hi> ſaluteth him in the name of a friend, while he comes to betray him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His treachery againſt his friendly and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Lord, was much the fouler, by reaſon of the long communion with him both at table and at ſacred offices. This treachery was expreſly foreſhadowed by <hi>Achitophels</hi> treaſon againſt
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:7892:134"/>
                     <hi>David</hi>; of whom it is probable, the former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints were literally meant. Both the treaſons were abominably wicked, but <hi>Ahitophels</hi> more generous, <hi>Iudas</hi> moſt baſely wicked: for hee had no provocation to meditate revenge upon his Maſter, who had never done him, nor any living ſoule wrong, but went about doing good to all, and healing all that ſought to him for help, though poſſeſſed with Devills. But this kind of healing, <hi>Iudas</hi> did not ſeeke, but rather through entertainment of greedy and covetous projects, did invite the Devill to enter into his heart, at that very time, wherein the doore of ſaving health and entrance into the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was to bee ſet open to all. <hi>Ahitophel</hi> had ſome pretence, or provocation to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe upon his Maſter, by reaſon of the indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie done unto his family, and ſtaining of his blood by <hi>David,</hi> in defiling his neere kinſwoman or Neece, <hi>Bathſheba.</hi> Yet was <hi>Ahitophels</hi> malice towards <hi>Davids</hi> perſon more bitter: for hee ſought his life, and reſolved to wreak his foehood upon him in the higheſt degree; and had atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his purpoſe, ſo <hi>Abſalom</hi> would have hearkned ſo well to his ſecond adviſe, as he did to his firſt. His firſt adviſe, which was full of revengefull retaliation for <hi>Davids</hi> folly with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> wee have recorded the 2. of <hi>Samuel</hi> 16.20. <hi>Then ſaid Abſalom to Ahitophel, Give counſell among you what we ſhall doe. And Ahitophel ſaid unto Abſalom, Goe in unto thy fathers concubines, which hee hath left to keepe the houſe, and all Iſrael ſhall heare, that thou
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:7892:135"/>
art abhorred of thy father: then ſhall the hands of all that are with thee, be ſtrong. So they ſpread Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom a tent upon the top of the houſe, and Abſalom went in unto his fathers concubines, in ſight of all Iſraell. Moreover Ahitophel ſaid to Abſalom, Let mee now chuſe out twelve thouſand men, and I will ariſe, and purſue after David this night. And I will come upon him, while hee is weary, and weake handed; and I will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him ſhall flee, and I will ſmite the King one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And I will bring backe all the people unto thee: the man whom thou ſeekeſt, is as if all returned: ſo all the people ſhall bee in peace.</hi> And the ſaying plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Abſalom</hi> well, and all the Elders of Iſrael for a while. But after <hi>Ahitophel</hi> ſaw this his ſecond and more deadly project, defeated by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary counſell of <hi>Huſhai</hi>; hee gave his enterpriſe and himſelfe for loſt: and in deepe melancholy (yet willing to ſet his houſe in order) went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, and hanged himſelfe. <hi>Iudas</hi> in like maner, after the chiefe Prieſts, and Elders had daſhed his plot, which was onely to gaine ſome money, and their favour for his gratefull ſervice without any deſire of blood; did caſt away the hire of his treaſon, and himſelfe with it. But of his caſting downe the money in the Temple, and the maner of his fearefull end, there will bee fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter occaſion to ſay ſomewhat <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 26.</note> hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>David</hi> after he had been aſſuredly informed of <hi>Abſaloms</hi> conſpiracy againſt him, forſooke Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem: and he, and all his traine or neceſſary attendance went on their bare feet, with their

heads covered and weeping, <hi>over the brooke Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, and along the mount of Olives,</hi> 2. Sam. 15.23, 30. And thus the Sonne of <hi>David</hi> a little after hee ſaw <hi>Iudas</hi> reſolved to betray him, or rather af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it pleaſed him to take notice of the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie againſt him, betweene <hi>Iudas</hi> and the chiefe Prieſts and Elders, marched the ſame way with a leſſer traine, accompanied onely with his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, but with more full aſſurance of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from preſent danger, then <hi>Davids</hi> great traine had: becauſe hee caried the true Ark of the Lord in his breaſt, whoſe type or ſhadow, <hi>David</hi> being uncertaine or doubtfull of the event, ſent back againe to Jeruſalem with the Prieſts that did wait upon it. Yet he himſelfe went over the brook Kidron with a ſadder heart, then <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> his father had done. <hi>David,</hi> and his traine, though much greater, and better able to reſiſt the violence of the Purſuer, then his traine was; marched further in that night wherein they fled from <hi>Abſalom,</hi> then the mount of Olives. The Sonne of <hi>David</hi> took up his ſtation in a garden, neere about the mount of Olives, and there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the encounter of the <hi>Arch-Ahitophel</hi> (which had vanquiſht the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in a garden) now attended with a greater hoaſt of infernall Aſſociates, then <hi>Ahitophel</hi> did require of <hi>Abſalom</hi> for the ſurpriſall of <hi>David,</hi> and his traine, about the ſame place or not farre beyond it, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.</p>

For the moſt valiant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall that is, which ſtands in need of Support or helpe from his meaneſt Souldier, is for the time being, lower then hee is, which lends him his hand, or helps him up being throwen downe or proſtrate. Now this our chiefe Leaders Agony, and the time betweene his apprehenſion and his death, was the onely time that little while, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Pſalmiſt ſpeakes, wherein CHRIST JESUS, as man, was made lower then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, lower then the ordinary ſonnes of men. For hee was, as another Pſalmiſt in his Perſon complaines, <hi>a worme, and no man.</hi> But immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after this bitter Agony, the ſtrength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the Sonne of righteouſneſſe, which for a time was eclipſed or overcaſt with a bloody ſweat, did breake forth afreſh, and though in the night time, did no leſſe dazell and aſtoniſh the armed band, which came with <hi>Iudas</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him, then the light which ſhone at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day did S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was armed with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to attach his Followers. For immediatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that Cup which he prayed againſt, was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from him; <hi>Hee knowing all things</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Iohn) that ſhould come upon him, went forth, and ſaid unto them that came to apprehend him, Whom ſeeke yee? They anſwered him, Ieſus of Nazareth.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:7892:137"/>
Ieſus ſaith unto them, I am hee. And Iudas alſo which betrayed him, ſtood with them. Aſſoone then, as hee had ſaid unto them, I am hee, they went back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and fell to the ground. Then asked hee them againe, Whom ſeeke yee? And they ſaid, Ieſus of Nazareth. Ieſus anſwered, I have told you, that I am hee. If therefore, yee ſeek me, let theſe goe their way. That the ſaying might be fulfilled which hee ſpake, Of them which thou gaveſt mee, I have loſt none,</hi> Joh. 18, 4, 5, 6, &amp;c. Here was a true docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of his royall and ſpirituall power: of his royall power, in that hee could command them to forbeare any violence towards his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; yea not to oppoſe violence offered unto one of their company. <hi>For Simon Peter</hi> (as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith) <hi>having a ſword, drew it, and cut off one of the ſervants of the high Prieſts right eare: the ſervants name was Malchus,</hi> 10, 11. verſes &amp;c. St. <hi>Luke</hi> recordeth, <hi>that hee touched his eare and healed him:</hi> ſo farre was he from all deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon his enemies. This was an act of his power ſpirituall: ſo was that likewiſe in prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting his Diſciples from danger, as well of ſoule, as of body. For as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> (to my apprehenſion) intimates, if they had been put unto the ſame fiery triall, unto which hee himſelfe was expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they had denied him and their former faith. Therefore hee commanded his Apprehenders to let them goe their way, that the ſaying might be fulfilled which he ſpake (ſome few houres before,) <hi>Of them which thou gaveſt me, have I loſt none,</hi> John 18.10. So he had ſaid, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.11. <hi>And now I am
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:7892:137"/>
no more in the world, but theſe are in the world, and I come to thee Holy Father, keepe through thine owne Name, thoſe whom thou haſt given me; that they may be one, as we are. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy Name: thoſe that thou gaveſt mee I kept, and none of them is loſt, but the ſonne of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> Either <hi>Iudas</hi> was never one of them, whom his Father had given him, or at leaſt, at this time, had given himſelfe to his Father the Devill.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 But as one, and the ſame prophecy, may be often filled by events much diſtant in time: ſo may divers prophecies, much diſtant for time, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht in one and the ſame event, in the ſame point of time; as in this diſmiſſion of JESUS his Diſciples, both his owne praediction (as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us) was fulfilled, and another prophecy like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as we may gather from S. <hi>Mark,</hi> or rather from our Saviours expoſition recorded by the Evangeliſt <hi>Mark</hi> 14. <hi>Ieſus ſaith unto them, All yee ſhall be offended becauſe of me this night. For it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, I will ſmite the Shepheard, and the ſheepe ſhall be ſcattered.</hi> This ſmiting of the Shepheard, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other prophecies, both foretold, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured, (as is probable) by the death of <hi>Ioſiah:</hi> unto which moſt referr that of <hi>Ieremiah, Lamen.</hi> 4.20. <hi>The breath of our noſe-thrills, the Anointed of the Lord, was taken in their pits; of whom, we ſaid, under his ſhadow, we ſhall live among the heathen.</hi> Some there are, which referr this complaint, unto the Captivity of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> but not ſo pertinently or conſiderately, as moſt other of their meditations
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:7892:138"/>
or obſervations would occaſion the Reader to expect. For the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> did never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch hope of <hi>Zedekiah</hi> or <hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> as the deepe ſtraine of this particular threne or throb doth import. No ſonne of good <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> was either in life or death, ſuch a type of the Lords promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Annointed, as himſelf had beene. From the houre of his death, untill the return of his people from Babyloniſh Captivity, Jeruſalem and Judah did not ſee one joyfull day: the light of Gods Countenance did not ſhine upon them, as the hiſtory of the Old Teſtament, eſpecially of the Bookes of Kings and Chronicles do ſufficiently teſtifie. Nor did this Nation from the day of our Saviours death, enjoy one quiet or ſecure day: not one houre, wherein there either was not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent danger, or ſome ſecret breeding of new calamities: nor ſhall they enjoy any, till it pleaſe him whom they crucified, to reſtore them againe to the land of their Inheritance, from which they are ſcattered: or at leaſt, to their ſpirituall ſtate, from which they are fallen.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 That the forementioned lamentation or threne, did in the literall and hiſtoricall ſenſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre unto the untimely death of good <hi>Ioſiah</hi>; that the calamities which enſued upon his death, did typically portend juſt matter of greater ſorrow for the death of the Lords Anointed <gap reason="foreign">

So then <hi>Sampſon</hi> in his ſtrength and weakneſſe or dejected eſtate, was a lively type of JESUS of Nazareth in both his eſtates and conditions of life, whileſt he lived here on earth. No type at all,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:7892:140"/>
not ſo much as a ſhadow of Chriſts humilitie and patience in all his ſufferings, but rather a foile by his impatience to ſet a luſtre upon the unparalleld meekneſſe of this true Nazarite of God by an <hi>Antiperiſtaſis. Sampſons</hi> laſt prayers unto the God of his ſtrength were, that he would give him po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer at the houre of his death, to be revenged on his Enemies, for the loſſe of his eyes.

And for the Roman Souldiers, which were the Executioners of their malicious merriment, he prayes for both in ſuch a ſweet and heavenly manner, as no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had ever done for his Perſecutors, <hi>Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, for they know not what they doe.</hi> He did not ſo much as either lift up hand or voice, or conceive any ſecret prayer againſt one or other of his perſecutors, during the time of his lingring, but deadly paines; as knowing, this was the time wherein his body was to be made as an anvile, that he might doe the will of his Father by the Sacrifice of himſelf, and ſufferance of all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities, more bitter to a meere man, than twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deaths, though of the croſſe. The effect or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Gods will in this ſacrifice (as our Apoſtle inſtructs us) was our Sanctification.

offered up once for all, as our Apoſtle interprets the meaning of the Author, or rather of the Holy Ghoſt, who did inſpire the Author of the fortieth Pſalme with the ſpirit of Prophecie.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

I had many yeares agoe ſundry probable notions or conjectures, that this Pſalme, though inſcribed a Pſalme of <hi>David,</hi> or revealed to <hi>David</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Vide Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebrardum in Pſal. <hi>3.</hi>

But theſe conjectures, and the peruſall of ſuch notes, as I had then gathered concerning the Author of this Pſalme, I now wave, or rather altogether omit. But whether the Author of this Pſalme (ſuppoſe <hi>David</hi>) did act his owne part, as having ſome ſpeciall Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion from the Lord to inſtruct the people, that to doe Gods will in ſome peculiar ſervice then required, was better then ſacrifice, much better then burnt offering: or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſpake this divine viſion or rapture, in the perſon of the Meſſias alone; this (however) is moſt certain that the 6, 7, &amp; 8. verſes of that 40. Pſalme, do containe a concludent Prophecie of the aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of legall ſacrifices, by the ſacrifice of Chriſts body. The argument or demonſtration is moſt

divinely gathered, and irrefragably preſt home to this purpoſe by our Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. from the 4. verſe to the 11. <hi>It is not poſsible, that the blood of Bulls and Goats ſhould take away ſinnes.

Then ſaid I, Loe, I come (In the volume of the booke it is written of mee,) to doe thy will, O God. Above, when he ſaid, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for ſinne thou wouldeſt not, neither hadſt pleaſure therein, which are offered by the Law: then ſaid hee, Loe, I come to doe thy will (O God:) hee taketh away the firſt, that hee may eſtabliſh the ſecond.

If either of them or <hi>Ribera</hi> had dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently read ſome Writers of Reformed Churches (their Ancients in time) upon the 10. of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> any one of them might have ſpoken more fully and punctually to the queſtion, then all of them doe. For if wee take it as granted, which the <hi>Tigurine</hi> note upon the forecited fortieth Pſalme imports, to wit, that <hi>to open the eare,</hi> is a ſpeech ſymbolicall: the ſymbolicall ſenſe of it, is beſt expreſſed by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in that portion of Scripture, which was appointed by the ancient Catholique Church, and retained by our Orthodoxall Engliſh, for the Epiſtle on Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day (in <hi>hebdomade ſancta</hi>) or weeke before Eaſter. The exegeticall expoſition of the Hebrew, <hi>to open the eares,</hi> made by the Prophet, implies a qualification or rather conſecration of the whole body, for ſuffering all maner of grievances, that could bee inflicted upon it: and that this qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was to be wrought by the eare, as it is the ſenſe of diſcipline, whether active or paſſive, whether of underſtanding or of patience in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. Nor are the Seventy Interpreters in this point to bee blamed, (eſpecially the Tranſlation being ſo well approved by our Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.) for their variation in words from the Hebrew, but rather to be admired for their divine expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the intent, and meaning of the Holy Ghoſt, as well in the fortieth Pſalme, as in the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:7892:143"/>
tenth to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> The Pſalmiſt doubtleſſe did foretell, and the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> did perhaps both foretel and forepicture the indignities done unto our Saviours body in the high Prieſts Hall, by the Jews: and in the Common hall or Seſſions houſe, by the Roman Souldiers, and upon the Croſſe by both. This Prophet more particularly foretold his undaunted patience and reſolution, in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whatſoever they did, or could inflict upon him. To parallel the Prophet with the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, the Prophets words are theſe; <hi>The Lord God hath opened mine eares, (aperuit aures,</hi> not <hi>aures per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fodit,</hi> or <hi>perforavit) and I was not rebellious, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther turned away back. I gave my back to the ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off my haire. I hid not my face from ſhame and ſpitting. For the Lord God will help mee, therefore ſhall I not bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded; therefore have I ſet my face like a flint, and I know, that I ſhall not bee aſhamed. Hee is neere, that juſtifieth me, who will contend with me? Let us ſtand together: who is mine adverſary? let him come neere to me. Behold the Lord God will help mee: who is hee that ſhall condemne mee? Loe, they all ſhall wax old, as doth a garment: the moth ſhall eat them up,</hi> Iſaiah 50.5, 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This reſolution or undaunted patience (which is the effect or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of <hi>opening the eare</hi>) doth fully import <hi>corpus aptatum,</hi> not an humane body, onely fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med or faſhioned in the womb, as Chriſts was, but a body qualified, or fitted by the diſcipline of the eare, for all maner of ſufferings, as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a ſervant, to doe his Maſters will, though
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:7892:144"/>
by ſuffering the moſt cruell death or torture, that could bee inflicted upon him. And ſuch was the body of Chriſt, wherein he executed that part of his Father will, by which we are ſanctified once for all. But the circumſtances precedent and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent to the Propheticall paſſages, will occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the attentive Reader to diſpute with himſelf, at leaſt to move the like queſtion to that, which the Eunuch propoſed to <hi>Philip,</hi> as whether hee ſpoke all this onely in the perſon of Chriſt, or reſpectively both of Chriſt, and of himſelfe? That the Prophet when he compoſed that divine paſſage, had an explicite previſion of the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, which ſhould be done unto his Lord; and of his admirable reſolution to ſuffer them with inimitable patience; there is no queſtion but (as hath been oftentime obſerved before) the ſpirit of the moſt Evangelicall Prophets (of which ranke <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was a ſpeciall one) were uſually elevated unto raptures or previſions of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours ſufferings, by their owne like ſufferings. They had not onely a cleare foreſight, but a true feeling of them (though in a farre leſſe meaſure, and lower degree, then Chriſt himſelfe had;) <hi>Yee ſtiffnecked, and uncircumciſed in hearts, and eares</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Steven) yee doe alwayes reſiſt the holy Ghoſt: as your fathers did, ſo due yee. Which of the Prophets have not your fathers perſecuted? And they have ſlaine them, which ſhewed before of the comming of the juſt one; of whom yee have been now the betrayers, and murderers,</hi> Acts 6.51, 52. If theſe later Jews did to our Saviour CHRIST,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:7892:144"/>
as their fathers had done to the Prophets his forerunners; then the Prophets did ſuffer the like indignities of the former generation, as Chriſt did of the latter. They were not onely forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners or foretellers of him, but types or ſhadows of him in all his ſufferings. No Prophet was more cruelly dealt with, then the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> None did partake more deepely of the royall Sonne of <hi>Davids</hi> affliction, then this Propheticall ſonne of <hi>David:</hi> for <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was of the royall blood a neere kinſman to wicked <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> who cauſed him to be ſawed to death, if we may beleeve Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Stories.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in the beginning of this 50. Chapter, brings in the Lord thus debating with the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, rebellious people of his time, <hi>Where is the bill of your Mothers divorcement, whom I have put away? Or which of my Creditors is it, to whom I have ſold you? Behold, for your iniquities have you ſold your ſelves, and for your tranſgreſsions is your Mother put away. Wherefore when I came, was there no man; When I called, was there none to anſwer? Is my hand ſhortned at all, that it cannot redeeme? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the ſea: I make the rivers a wilderneſſe: their fiſh ſtinketh, becauſe there is no water, and dieth for thirſt. I clothe the heavens with blackneſſe, and I make ſackcloth their covering. Verſe</hi> 1, 2, 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in the 4. verſe hee altereth the perſon, if not of the Speaker, yet of him to whom he ſpeakes; <hi>The Lord God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to me the tongue of the learned, that I ſhould know how to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to him that is weary. He

                     </gap>, who had thus qualified him. And ſo no doubt hee was in that reſolution, which hee took upon him from the opening of the eare, verſe 4. before cited. In both places it is remarkeable, that he doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile the God of his ſtrength, and comfort by the Name of <gap reason="foreign">

this Lord God had opened his eare, yet the reſolution, which hee profeſſed was greater, then hee had occaſion to put in practice, at leaſt with ſuch undaunted patience, as our Saviour did.

                     </gap> his Lord, and God, but unto God as his Father. And this is to mee a pregnant argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that not only the forecited place of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> but many other hymnes or Pſalmes, eſpecially in or after <hi>Davids</hi> time, were literally meant of the Prophets, which compoſed them, eſpecially in reſpect of this circumſtance of the perſon or party to whom they prayed, ſeeing our Saviour in his prayers to God did never uſe the ſame title they did. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> himſelf had many and juſt occaſions in his own perſon to conceive that excellent prayer, <hi>Bow downe thy care, O Lord, and heare me: for I am poore and needy, &amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 86. Yet were the occaſions, and matter of this Pſalme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally accompliſht in the Sonne of <hi>David,</hi> whom <hi>David</hi> here as in the 110. Pſalme twice inſtileth his Lord and God, as verſe 12. <hi>I will praiſe thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will glorifie thy Name for evermore.</hi> And verſe 15. <hi>And thou, O Lord, art a God full of pitty &amp; compaſsion, &amp; gracious, long ſuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth. Moſes</hi> had ſaid the ſame in effect long before: onely he doth not give the title of Lord, nor intimate ſuch a cleare diſtinction of the perſons in the Trinitie, as <hi>David</hi> in this 110. Pſalme did. For <hi>David</hi> (as
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:7892:146"/>
was obſerved before) had a cleare previſion, that albeit the Meſſias or promiſed ſeed was to be his Sonne, yet was withall to be the Sonne of God: therefore to be that <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="7">7. But to returne to the forecited place of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the words immediately following the forecited place, verſe 8. [<hi>Hee is neere that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth me: who will contend with me? &amp;c. Behold the Lord God will help me: who is he that ſhall condemne mee?</hi>] were literally, and reſpectively meant not only of Chriſts forerunners, but of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: and are ſo applyed by our Apoſtle, <hi>Romanes</hi> 8.30.31. <hi>If God be for us, who can be againſt us?</hi> And againe verſe 33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It is God that juſtifieth: who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſsion for us.</hi> The Apoſtle in this had the ſame confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Chriſt the Lord and in his ſufferings, which the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had in the Lord his God, to whom he directs his prayers. And ſo may all others have, that faithfully beleeve in him: that is, all ſuch, to whom their owne conſciences can teſtifie ſuch a true conformitie unto Chriſt in his ſufferings, as our Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were conſcious of in their Soules and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And any other mark of Election, beſides this, I know none: nor will it be eaſie for the Reader whoſoever he be, to find any other in the day of tryall or temptation.</p>

                     <pb n="283" facs="tcp:7892:146"/>8. The Evangelicall parallel to the Prophet <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> prediction, we have in part <hi>Luke</hi> 22.63, 64. <hi>And the men that held Ieſus, mocked him, and ſmote him, and when they had blindfolded him, they ſtroke him on the face, and asked him, ſaying, Prophecie, who is it that ſmote thee?</hi> Thus they dealt with him in the high Prieſts Hall, before his examination or ſentence given againſt him. And ſo again they uſed him at his examination <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.19. <hi>The high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his doctrine: Ieſus anſwered, I ſpake openly to the world, &amp;c. Why askeſt thou me? Ask them which heard me, what I have ſaid unto them: behold they know what I ſaid. And when hee had thus ſpoken, one of the Officers which ſtood by, ſtruck</hi> Jeſus <hi>with the palme of his hand, ſaying, Anſwereſt thou the high Prieſt ſo?</hi> Unto this indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity he replies with ſuch meekneſſe and patience, as no Prophet in like caſe ever uſed, onely thus, <hi>If I have ſpoken evill, beare witneſſe of the evill: but if well, why ſmiteſt thou me?</hi> To the like indignities done unto by him the Roman Souldiers &amp; by <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> he maketh no reply at all. So that however the forecited words of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and of the Pſalmiſt, Pſalme 40. and the 86. might be reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively verified of themſelves; yet were they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver exactly fulfilled, ſave onely of that <gap reason="foreign">

None of them ever had a bodie ſo fitted, or their eares ſo opened by the Lord God, as this Lord God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had, a temper of body and mind not moveable to any paſſion either by indignitie of ſpeeches which he heard, or by the blows which he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

If thus much had not been both fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told and foreſhadowed both by <hi>Moſes</hi> and other Prophets, our Saviour would not have cenſured thoſe two Diſciples whom hee did vouchſafe to accompany to <hi>Emaus,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Wee truſted that it had been hee, who ſhould have redeemed Iſrael.</hi> His taxe of this their preſent diſtruſt or dull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, is more ſharpe, then any reply or anſwere, which hee made unto ſuch malicious Infidels, as from the time of his apprehenſion did deride, beate, ſcourge, and crucifie him, for avouching he was the God of Iſrael or King of the Jews. For unto theſe two Diſciples hee ſaid; <hi>O fooles and ſlow of heart to beleeve all that the Prophets have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things, and to enter into his glory? And beginning at Moſes and all the Prophets, hee expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himſelfe,</hi>
                     <pb n="285" facs="tcp:7892:147"/>
Luke 24.25, 26. I can no way diſlike, but rather approve of <hi>Maldonats</hi> and other learned Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators wiſhes upon this place, that, if ſo it had pleaſed the Lord, the Evangeliſt had related unto us, either the places which hee expounded to them, or his expoſitions upon them. But (as I have heretofore advertiſed the Reader, and ſhall take occaſion hereafter to put him in mind) it ſeemed not expedient to the wiſdome of God, to have the full expoſition, either of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our or the Apoſtles themſelves, upon thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which they alledge, extant upon undoubted record: but rather to exhibit us certaine hints or juſt matter of ſober and ſerious ſearch of the Scriptures, which they alledge. Amongſt other ſacred paſſages, which our Saviour expounded to thoſe two Diſciples, I make no queſtion, but the eighty ſecond Pſalme was one. To omit all enquiry who was the Author of the Pſalme, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Aſaph</hi> (whoſe inſcription it beares) or <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> himſelfe: or what ſpeciall occaſions, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, whoſoever he was, had to compoſe it, whether his owne experience in ſuffering wrong: or ſome obſervation of groſſe partiality or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the courſe of Juſtice towards others: the Pſalme it ſelfe is Propheticall, and was never ſo punctually verified at any time before or ſince, as it was at our Saviours examination by the high Prieſt and Elders, and at his arraignment before <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi>; yet the full accompliſhment of the laſt clauſe will not be, untill the finall day of Judgement: <hi>God ſtandeth in the Congregation of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:7892:148"/>
the Mighty</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>he judgeth among the Gods. How long will yee judge unjuſtly, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the perſons of the wicked? Defend the poore and fatherleſſe: doe juſtice to the afflicted, and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: deliver the poore and needy: rid them out of the hands of the wicked,</hi> Pſalme 82.1, 2, 3, 4. Here was a faire caveat put into the Courts of Juſtice by the Pſalmiſt, not to paſſe ſentence upon the Meſſias for ſaying hee was the Sonne of God, or for making himſelfe equall with God: not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the perſon of <hi>Barabbas</hi> before him, who now as GOD did ſtand amongſt them. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this caveat of the Pſalmiſt, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of time, and the manner of their owne proceedings againſt him, did warne them, as <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats</hi> wife did him, to beware how they had any thing to doe with that juſt and holy man. And our Saviour himſelfe vouchſafeth to bee the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer, that however hee now ſtood to bee Judged by them, yet he was that very God, which the Pſalmiſt foretold ſhould be their Judge, and the Judge of the whole world: For ſo the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt concludeth; <hi>Ariſe O God, and judge the earth: for thou ſhalt inherite all Nations,</hi> verſe 8. This univerſall Inheritance and power to judge the earth, was beſtowed upon our Saviour at his reſurrection, after they had judged him for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was the Sonne of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. After they had ſought many falſe witneſſes againſt him, but could find none whoſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies did agree, or if they agreed, did reach home to convince him of any capitall crime: they
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:7892:148"/>
ſought to entrap him by his owne confeſſion, which being judicially made and taken, they knew to be a full and legall conviction. <hi>The high Prieſt,</hi> failing in his intended ſubornations againſt him, <hi>ſaid unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us, whether thou bee the Chriſt, the Sonne of God,</hi> Matth. 26.62, 63. And unto this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatory miniſtred unto him, by the high Prieſt <hi>ex officio,</hi> not in a criminall cauſe, but in a point of beliefe or doctrine, hee vouchſafeth a full and punctuall anſwere, as to his competent Judge <hi>quoad haec</hi>; ſuch an anſwere, as he did not vouchſafe either to <hi>Herod,</hi> when he was brought before him, nor to the high Prieſt and Elders, when they examined him before the two falſe witneſſes, which at the laſt caſt were brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: Theſe circumſtances wee have rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the forecited place of St. <hi>Matthew: At the laſt came two falſe witneſſes, and ſaid, This fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſaid, I am able to deſtroy the Temple of God, and build it in three dayes. The high Prieſt ſaid unto him, Anſwereſt thou nothing? what is it which theſe witneſſe againſt thee? But Ieſus held his peace,</hi> Matth. 26.60, &amp;c. And S. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, <hi>Chap.</hi> 23.9. <hi>When Herod queſtioned him in many things, hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him nothing. But aſſoone as the high Prieſt adjured him by the living God to tell him the truth, whether hee was the Chriſt, the Sonne of the living God; Ieſus ſaith unto him, thou haſt ſaid. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe I ſay unto you, hereafter ſhall you ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of power, and comming in the clouds of heaven. Then the high
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:7892:149"/>
Prieſt rent his clothes, ſaying, Hee hath ſpoken bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemie: what further need have wee of witneſſes? Behold, now yee have heard his blaſpemy: what think yee? They anſwered, and ſaid, Hee is guilty of death,</hi> Matth. 26.65, 66. All theſe circumſtances are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by S. <hi>Luke,</hi> but not in the ſame order, which S. <hi>Matthew</hi> doth, for (as hath been heretofore obſerved) albeit wee are bound to beleeve, that every Evangeliſt wrot nothing but divine truth, yet every one of them, did not record the whole truth, with all its circumſtances, nor relate either our Saviours anſwers or his enemies practiſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, in the ſame order of time, in which they were made or exhibited. St. <hi>Matthew</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres, or rather intermingles the fulfilling of <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> Prophecy for ſpitting in his face, for buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feting him, and ſmiting him with the palmes of their hands, with the relation of his anſwere to the high Prieſt, and his Aſſociats cenſure againſt him: <hi>Then did they ſpit in his face, &amp;c.</hi> Matth. 26.67, 68. S. <hi>Luke tells us that they which held him over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, when Peter denied him, did mocke him and ſmite him, &amp;c.</hi> Luke 22. ver. 63, &amp;c. And againe that the high Prieſt put the forementioned In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatory to him, in the morning, after <hi>Peter</hi> had denied him. And <hi>verſe</hi> 66. this is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the high Prieſt and his Complices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hypocrites, would at leaſt be carefull to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the outward or viſible forme of Juſtice, which was not to examine men, or produce wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt them after midnight or in the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.

But wee need not to rely upon probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, concerning the time wherein they exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our Saviour: for that is plainely and aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively ſet downe by S. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. <hi>Aſſoone as it was day, the Elders of the people, the chief Prieſts, And Scribes came together, and led him into the Council, ſaying, Art thou the Chriſt? tell us. And he ſaid unto them; If I tell you, you will not beleeve. And if I ask you, you will not anſwere mee, nor let mee goe,</hi> verſe 66, 67, &amp;c. St. <hi>Luke</hi> although hee moſt exactly obſerves the order of the proceſſe, and circumſtance of time, omits the adjuration of the high Prieſt, and the production of the falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt him. But to recompenſe this omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, hee interſerts one reply of our Saviour to the adjuring interrogatory, which St. <hi>Matthew</hi> expreſſeth not, but unto which his other expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions muſt have ſpeciall reference, if we will make true Grammaticall conſtruction of them. For upon this interrogatory, <hi>Art thou the Chriſt? tell us,</hi> as S. <hi>Luke</hi> hath it, <hi>hee ſaid unto them, If I tell you, you will not beleeve, and if I alſo ask you, you will not anſwere me, nor let me goe.</hi> And here S. <hi>Matthews</hi> ellipticall expreſſion of the anſwere following, doth ſomewhat raiſe or quicken St.

                     <hi>Luke</hi> more full expreſſion; St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhall the Sonne of man ſit on the right hand of the power of God.</hi>

                     <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 26.64.</note> This adverſative particle, <hi>Nevertheleſſe,</hi> referres to that of S. <hi>Luke</hi> which S. <hi>Matthew</hi> omits, <hi>If I tell you, you will not beleeve me, &amp;c.</hi> Though there bee ſome variation in the words, yet they agree as well as a <hi>ſharp</hi> and a <hi>flat</hi> in muſick: whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is omitted by either is but as a reſt in ſong. The full tone or harmony betwixt them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to this:
<q>However yee will not beleeve what I ſay: nor deale ingenuouſly with mee, yet at your perill be it: For I muſt tell you the truth which you know in part, but will not know; but which hereafter ye ſhall more then beleeve.</q>
                     <hi>For yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſit on the right hand of the power of God, &amp;c.</hi> This they knew well to bee a ſeate onely for the Sonne of God, and therefore, whereas before they had onely interrogated, whether he was the Chriſt, they put the ſecond interrogatory to him, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> relateth them plainly and diſtinctly, though St. <hi>Matthew</hi> put them both into one; <hi>I adjure thee by the living God that thou tell us whether thou be the Chriſt the Sonne of God,</hi> Matt. 26.63. <hi>Then ſaid they all, Art thou then the Sonne of God? And he ſaid unto them, Yee ſay that I am,</hi> Luke 22.66, and the 70. And upon this confeſſion they proceed againſt him. Now this anſwere or confeſſion implies theſe two fundamentall points of belief: The firſt,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:7892:150"/>
that this JESUS of Nazareth, whom they now convented, was the Chriſt. The ſecond, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee was the Sonne of man, yet being the CHRIST, he was likewiſe the Son of God, not by adoption but by nature or <hi>primogeniture.</hi> For unleſſe this had been the meaning of their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory and of his anſwere, they could not have condemned him of blaſphemy, for avouching himſelf to be the Meſſias: that is, the Son of God in ſuch a ſenſe, as <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Adam</hi> in his integrity had been, or any of the pure Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Subſtances are. They took it as granted, nor did he deny it, that he made himſelf ſuch a Sonne of God, as was equall with God. And this to their apprehenſion was blaſphemy; a capitall crime, and ſo they cenſure it. So then here was God ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Congregation of the Mighty. Theſe earthly Gods did judge him, and he againe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them: at leſt he declareth himſelf to bee that Judge, which was to judge them and the Gentiles too. But as the Pſalmiſt in this forecited Pſalme had fore-prophecied, <hi>They know not neither will they underſtand: they walk on in darkneſſe; all the foundations of the earth are out of courſe.</hi> They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were <hi>Gods, and all of them children of the moſt High: yet all to die like men, and fall,</hi> as former great ones had done. But not the ſonnes of God after ſuch a maner as he was, who albeit hee was to die like man, yet not to fall like one of the Princes, but to riſe againe by power of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head to judge the earth.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the Sonne of man, and the Sonne of God was willing to beare our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and take all our infirmities upon him; to the end he might bee a faithfull Comforter of all ſuch, as mourne: ſo it was his pleaſure likewiſe to ſuffer this moſt groſſe and deteſtable civill wrong from the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly powers of Juſtice, that he might be moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely qualified, even according to his humane nature, to do right unto ſuch as ſuffer like wrong: and juſtice upon all unjuſt Judges, eſpecially upon ſuch as perſecute others, as he was perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for bearing teſtimony unto the truth or fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall myſteries of our Salvation. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever theſe earthly Gods, or Rulers of the Jews did ſentence him to death for blaſphemie: yet were they not by divine providence permitted to put this ſentence in execution according to that maner of puniſhment, which Gods Law did award to Blaſphemers. For by the award of that Law he ſhould have been ſtoned to death. But as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> inſtructs us in this remarkeable point of Gods ſpeciall providence; When <hi>Pilate</hi> willing to free himſelf from guilt of innocent blood, <hi>bid them take him, and judge him according to their
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:7892:151"/>
law, they replide, It is not lawfull for us to put any man to death. Iohn</hi> 18.31. How true or pertinent this anſwer was, I will not here diſpute. But thus they anſwered, as the ſame Evangeliſt there tells us, that the ſaying of Jeſus might be fulfilled, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what death he ſhould die, and by whom. This ſaying or prophecy of our Saviour to which St. <hi>Iohn</hi> refers, is punctually ſet downe by S. <hi>Matthew</hi> 20.17, 18 <hi>Ieſus going up to Ieruſalem, took the twelve Diſciples apart in the way, and ſaid unto them; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, we goe up to Ieruſalem, and the Sonne of man ſhall be betrayed unto the chief Prieſts, and unto the Scribes; and they ſhall condemne him to death, and ſhall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to ſcourge, and to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie him.</hi> Unto this death of the croſſe they brought him, by their importunate, and ſubtill ſollicitations of <hi>Pilat,</hi> to proceed againſt him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another capital crime, then they by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended law had condemned him for. For they pronounc'd him as worthy and guilty of death (by their law) for blaſphemy: whereas, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Pilat</hi> they frame a new accuſation againſt him, for rebellion againſt <hi>Caeſar</hi>; becauſe he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelf to be King of the Jews, as in truth he was, for royall pitty and compaſſion towards them: but without any purpoſe to move the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to take armes, or to exerciſe any royall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over them, or any others upon earth, becauſe his kingdome was not of this world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Whileſt the high Prieſt and Elders ſate as Judges in their owne Councell-houſe, they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orn'd falſe witneſſes againſt him: but whileſt they
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:7892:152"/>
accuſe him before <hi>Pilat,</hi> they themſelves become the moſt malicious and falſeſt witneſſes that ever were produced, or offered themſelves voluntarily to teſtifie in open Court againſt any living man, in a cauſe criminall or capitall. All theſe malicious practices againſt him, were clearly foretold by the Pſalmiſt his forerunner in the like ſufferings, and in particular (I take it) by <hi>David</hi> himſelfe <hi>Pſalme</hi> 35. <hi>Falſe witneſſes did ariſe, they laid to my charge things that I knew not. They rewarded me evill for good, to the ſpoyling of my ſoule. But as for mee, when they were ſick, my cloathing was ſackcloth, I humbled my ſoule with faſting, and my prayer returned into mine owne boſome. I behaved my ſelfe, as though he had beene my friend or brother, I bowed downe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily as one that mourneth for his mother. But in mine adverſity they rejoyced, &amp;c. ver.</hi> 11, 12, 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus did the Compoſers of this <hi>Pſalme</hi> and of ſome others, to the like effect complaine: every man reſpectively in their owne perſons, and upon juſt occaſions. And however they did not in their murmuring complaints, yet in the cauſes or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the ſufferings, they did really prefigure juſter occaſions &amp; more grievous matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, on the behalf of their expected Redeemer. And he muſt have uttered the like complaints in a farre higher ſtraine, if he had beene but a meere man, not armed with patience or long ſuffering truly divine. The indignities done unto him by <hi>Pilat</hi> and the Roman Souldiers, by <hi>Herod</hi> and his men of warre, were perſpicuouſly foretold by <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>Why do the Heathens rage, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:7892:152"/>
imagina vaine thing?</hi> This parallel between the prophecy of <hi>David,</hi> and the hiſtoricall events anſwering to it, not the Apoſtles onely, but other inferiour Diſciples did unanimouſly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge upon the deliverance of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles from ſuch violence inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt them by the Rulers, and Elders of the Jews, (as had been practiſed by them upon our Saviour,) for working of a miracle in his name: <hi>When they had further threatned them, they let them goe, finding nothing how they might puniſh them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done. For the man was above forty yeares old, on whom this miracle of healing was ſhewne. And being let goe, they went to their owne company, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported all that the chief Prieſts and Elders had ſaid unto them. And when they heard that, they lift up their voice to God with one accord, and ſaid, Lord, thou art. God which haſt made heaven and earth, and the ſea and all that in them is: who by the mouth of thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> David <hi>haſt ſaid, Why do the heathens rage, and the people imagin vaine things? The Kings of the Earth ſtood up, and the Rulers were gathered together againſt the Lord and his Chriſt. For of a truth againſt thy holy childe</hi> JESUS, <hi>whom thou haſt annointed, both</hi> Herod <hi>and</hi> Pontius Pilat, <hi>with the Gentiles and the people of Iſrael, were gathered together for to doe whatſoever thy hand and thy Counſaile determined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be done. Acts</hi> 4.21, 22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. All of our Saviours Perſecutors, whether Jews or Gentiles, <hi>per dicta &amp; facta malè ominata,</hi> did reade their own doome and the doome of all
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:7892:153"/>
ſuch, unto the worlds end, as ſhall continue the courſe that they begun. The Roman Souldiers clothing him in a purple robe, by putting a crown of thornes upon his head, and by crying, All haile unto the King of the Jews, did act that part in jeſt or comicall merriment, which they muſt one day act in earneſt, and more then tragicall ſorrow. For he had ſworne it long before, <hi>That all knees ſhould bow unto him,</hi> and in that day, they which crowned him with thornes, ſhall ſee him crowned with Majeſty and glory. <hi>Herod</hi> in ſending him back to <hi>Pilat</hi> in a white or candid robe, did beare witneſſe of his innocency and integrity: and withall of <hi>Herod</hi> his fathers ſcarlet ſinnes, in putting ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poore Innocents to a bloudy death, upon the notice of his Nativitie. And as for <hi>Pilat</hi> and the Roman ſtate, by whoſe authority he was ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with rods here on earth; hee whoſe ſeat is in the heavens, did even then laugh them to ſcorne, and ſince hath broken the whole race of Roman <hi>Caeſars,</hi> with a rod of iron, and daſht them and their Monarchie to pieces, like a Potters veſſell. What more ſhall be done againſt theſe cruell Actors, or Abetters of their cruell practices againſt this King of Kings; I leave it wholly (with all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion) to his ſole determination. But that the Indignities done unto him by the Jews, by the Roman or other heathen Governors; and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible revenge, which hath ſince befalne them, were punctually foretold by <hi>David,</hi> Pſalme 2. the teſtimony before cited, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. is a proofe moſt authentick and moſt concludent.</p>

                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:7892:153"/>4. Yet of all the ſufferings which he ſuffered under <hi>Pontius Pilat,</hi> beſides the indignities done unto him in the extremities of his paines upon the Croſſe, (at which <hi>Pilat</hi> was not preſent;) the rejection of him by the Jews, when this heathen Governor out of a good nature or well meaning policy, had propoſed him with an infamous theef or murderer, was far the worſt, and doth deſerve the indignation of all that loved him. And this circumſtance is preſt home to them by S. <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 3.13, 14. <hi>The God of</hi> Abraham <hi>and of</hi> Iſack <hi>and of</hi> Jaacob; <hi>the God of our Fathers hath glorified his Sonne</hi> JESUS, <hi>whom ye delivered up, and denied in the preſence of</hi> Pilat, <hi>when he determined to let him goe. But ye denyed the holy One, and the luſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a Murderer to be granted unto you, and killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raiſed up from the dead, &amp;c.</hi> In this prepoſterous, and ſacrilegious choiſe, they did the Devill a more peculiar and more immediate ſervice, then their Idolatrous forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had ever done, either in adoring the brazen Serpent, (which was the moſt perverſe Idolatry, that ever they committed) or in ſacrificing their ſons &amp; daughters to the infernall ſpirits. In thoſe ſervices, they declare themſelves to be ſervants to Devils: In this ſiniſter choiſe they prove themſelves to be the Devils own ſonnes: and exactly fulfill our Saviours prophecy or diſcovery of their inclinations, before they themſelves did know them. For when Jeſus had told ſuch Jews as did in a ſort beleeve on him, that <hi>they were ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to ſinne, and could not be made free, but by the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:7892:154"/>
Sonne, who abideth in the houſe for ever:</hi> they chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickly reply, that they were the ſonnes of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> Our Saviour rejoynes, <hi>Yee are of your Father the Devill, and the luſts of your Father you will doe, hee was a murtherer from the beginning. Iohn</hi> 8.30. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the 44. And ſo they now deſire <hi>Barabbas,</hi> one whoſe name imports the ſonne of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and by quality, the ſonne of the Devill, an infamous murderer, to be delivered unto them, in memory of their deliverance out of Egypt: and importunately ſollicite the murder of the Sonne of God, of that very God, who had delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them out of Egypt: who ſpake to <hi>Moſes</hi> in Mount Sinai; that Lord God, unto whom <hi>Ioſhua</hi> and all the Judges that ſucceeded him, were but Generals in the time of warre; unto whom in time of peace or counſaile for direction of publick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, the beſt of the Prieſts and Prophets unto the dayes of <hi>Samuel,</hi> were but Deputies. For the Lord God of Iſrael all that time was their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat and proper King. Governors and Deputies they had ſucceſſively many, but none endued with royall Authority, beſides him. No matter of conſequence whether of warre or peace, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by their Governors without ſpeciall revelation or anſwer from him by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim,</hi> untill <hi>Samuels</hi> old age; <hi>Then all the Elders of Iſrael, gathered themſelves together, and came to</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel <hi>unto Ramah, and ſaid unto him, Behold thou art old, and thy ſonnes walk not in thy wayes: now make us a King to judge us, like all the Nations.

This proteſtation againſt their petition, and his patheticall fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning of them, what hard uſage they ſhould find under the King, whom they would chooſe, are ſet down at full from the 10. of this Chap. unto the 19. <hi>Nevertheleſſe the people refuſed to obey the voice of</hi> Samuel, <hi>and they ſaid, Nay, but we will have a King to rule over us, that we may be like all Nations, and that our King may judge us, and goe out before us, and fight our battels.</hi> And ſo after <hi>Samuel</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed their reſolution in the eares of the Lord their preſent King, notwithſtanding the proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and their forewarning concerning their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Kings manner of government, they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for the hardneſſe of their hearts, to goe to a free Election of a new King. Yet the calamities and oppreſſions which <hi>Samuel</hi> forewarnes would follow upon this their not approved Election, was ſcarce ſo much as verified in the daies of <hi>Saul,</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> or <hi>Solomon</hi>: never exactly fulfilled by any King of their owne nomination, or by any King impoſed upon them, untill they ſolemnely and openly diſclaime their Native King; (that very

God whom <hi>Samuel</hi> in all this buſineſſe had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted) and cryed, <hi>We have no King but Caeſar.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this nomination of <hi>Caeſar</hi> for their King, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever calamities foretold by <hi>Samuel,</hi> were in any part verified by their owne unruly Kings, were moſt exactly accompliſht by the race of <hi>Caeſars,</hi> unto whom they ſolemnely dedicated that allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which was due to <hi>Ieſus</hi> their ancient Lord and King.

                  <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ne hiſtoricall relation concerning <hi>Iudas</hi> and his fearefull end, there is, which is by S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> (who of all the foure Evangeliſts citeth the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of the Prophecie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in part of it was foretold) left ſomewhat ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous for the circumſtances of time, wherein it happened. Some perhaps would at the firſt ſight, conceive from St. <hi>Matthews</hi> words, that <hi>Iudas</hi> did caſt downe the hire of his treaſon in the Temple, immediatly after the chief Prieſts and Elders had bound our Saviour, and led him to <hi>Pontius Pilat</hi> the Governour. But if wee conſider other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of time related by S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and S. <hi>Luke,</hi> it is farre more probable that <hi>Iudas</hi> was not tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with ſorrow or grief: whether of mind or of body or of both, untill our Saviour was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to the death of the Croſſe by <hi>Pontius Pilat.</hi> For the firſt thing, which the chief Prieſts and Elders did, after they themſelves had paſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence on our Saviour, was the delivery of him to the Secular power, and their importunat ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Pilat</hi> to put their ſentence in execution. It was a memorable document of deadly hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie in the Prieſts and Elders, that they would
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:7892:156"/>
not enter into the Common-hall or publique Court of Juſtice to indite him there, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after to celebrate the uſuall ſervice for that day in the Temple. It was againe an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary courteſie in <hi>Pilat</hi> towards them, that he would vouchſafe to take their accuſations in the pavement or Court adjoyning to the Pretorium. But as well the curteſie of the one, as the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie of the other, friendly conſpired to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the will of God, which was to have his onely Sonne made that day a ſacrifice of atonement for the ſinnes both of the Jews, and Gentiles; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if <hi>Pilat</hi> had ſtood upon points of Authoritie or prerogative: it is more then probable, the Prieſts and Elders would rather have deferred their accuſations for that inſtant then have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Pretorium or Common-hall. But having once obtained their deſire in the <hi>Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> they immediately returned into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where <hi>Iudas</hi> attended them. And having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved (as hee thought) to have ſet his houſe or worldly buſineſſe in ſuch order, as <hi>Ahitophel</hi> had done his; hee went forth and hanged himſelf. So that albeit <hi>Iudas</hi> had ſeene his Maſter dead in law, that is, ſentenced to death by the high Prieſt and <hi>Pontius Pilat,</hi> upon the Jews importunat ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations and teſtimonies againſt him: Yet the Traitor having no witneſſe produced againſt him beſides his owne conſcience, No Judge or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Executioner beſides himſelf: did die an accurſed death, before his Maſter had made an atonement for the ſinnes of the world. So the

Pſalmiſt by way of imprecation had foretold; <hi>Let ſudden deſtruction come upon him unawares</hi> (or as others) <hi>let deſtruction come upon him, and let the net, that hee hath made for others, catch himſelf: into that very deſtruction let him fall,</hi> Pſalm. 35.8. How this imprecation though not directed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Iudas</hi> alone, did punctually fall upon him, will better appeare anon in the diſcuſſions, how the imprecations reiterated in the 109. Pſalme, were moſt punctually fulfilled in him. That which for the preſent I intended to advertiſe the Reader of, is briefly this; That if we referre the time of <hi>Iudas</hi> death, unto this point of time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated, the parallel betwixt St. <hi>Matthews</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his fearefull end, and other ſacred paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, will be more cleare. St. <hi>Matthews</hi> relation yee have in the 27. Chapter. 3. <hi>Then Iudas which had betrayed him, when he ſaw that he was condemned, repented himſelf, and brought againe the thirty pieces of ſilver to the chief Prieſts and Elders, ſaying; I have ſinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood: And they ſaid, What is that to us? See thou to that. And hee caſt downe the pieces of ſilver in the Temple, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and went and hanged himſelf. And the chief Prieſts took the ſilver pieces, and ſaid, It is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to put them into the Treaſury, becauſe it is the price of blood. And they tooke counſell, and bought with them the Potters field to bury ſtrangers in. Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this day. (Then was fulfilled that which was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Prophet Ieremiah ſaying, And they took the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:7892:157"/>
thirty pieces of ſilver, the price of him that was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, whom they of the children of Iſrael did value: and gave them for the Potters field, as the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed mee.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But where this caſting downe of the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie pieces of ſilver in the Temple, was foretold or by whom, there is, and hath been great vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie of opinions amongſt learned Interpreters, as well Ancient as Moderne; ſo great, that many of them have rather ſoiled, then any way cleared the meaning of the Evangeliſt: and left the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation of the truth, more difficult to the ingenuous and ſagacious Reader, then if they had not medled with it, or left it (untoucht) to his privat ſearch. The firſt difficulty is about the Grammaticall ſignification of ſome words in the Originall. The ſecond pitcheth upon a miſno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the Prophet, as whether that Prophecie, which the Evangeliſt ſaid was fulfilled in this fact of <hi>Iudas,</hi> was uttered or written by <hi>Zachariah,</hi> or the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> or reſpectively by both. The third, admitting thus much was either onely foretold, or both foretold, and forepictured either by <hi>Ieremiah</hi> or by <hi>Zachariah</hi> or by both, whether they ſpoke in their owne perſons or in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Iudas</hi> or of Chriſt or of both. The firſt difficulty or rather diſcord about the literall ſenſe of the Prophets words, as they are related by the Evangeliſt, hath been occaſioned partly by the Tranſlation of the Septuagint, and partly by the Author of the vulgar Latin. For whereas wee reade as well in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> as in the Prophet
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:7892:157"/>
                     <hi>Zachariah, And I caſt them</hi> ad figulum, <hi>to the Potter</hi>; the vulgar Latine hath it, And I caſt them <hi>ad Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taarium,</hi> to the Statue maker in the houſe of the Lord. The Septuagint thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> caſt them into the furnace or to the metal-mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Greek might import (though not ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly as the Latine) a Potters furnace. But if we take <hi>Statuarius</hi> (which is the expreſſion of the vulgar Latine) in its proper ſenſe, for a Statue maker whether in ſtone or of metall wrought with toole or molten, there could be no uſe of ſuch an Artificer in that Temple, wherein all Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues or Images of what ſtuffe ſoever they could be made were moſt ſtrictly forbidden; Or in that people among whom the erecting or making of them was a crime capital. To avoid this abſurditie in their Authenticated Tranſlation, the Sectaries of the Romiſh Church by the [Statuarie] would have us underſtand GOD himſelf, who is the former or faſhioner of all things. And for this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, they alledge ſome ancient Greek Fathers, but whoſe Authority, they themſelves will ſleight, or paſſe ſuch cenſures upon their Authors, as they will not permit us in like caſe to doe, whenſoever they make againſt their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Catholick tenets. The moſt learned In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters in the Romiſh Church, do partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray, and ſometimes openly profeſſe, that this Interpretation is too farre fetcht, and farre wide from the meaning of the Prophet (whoſoever he was,) as he is alledged by the Evangeliſt. What then could move ſo many of them to embrace, or
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:7892:158"/>
rather not to diſclaime theſe roving collections? Onely the authority of the Trent Councell, which hath ſo fettered them in this and other like points, that they dare not ſay that their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Soules are (under God) their owne: but are content to ſacrifice learning, reaſon, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe to many illiterat reſolutions of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, partial, and corrupt men in that Councel aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled. If the ingenuous Reader will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve me in this particular, let him take the pains to ſatisfie himſelf, by obſerving how <hi>Ribera</hi> and <hi>Caſtrus</hi> with ſome other men very well learned, and ingenuous (ſo farre as they durſt) have utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt themſelves in their Commentaries upon the 11. of <hi>Zacharie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Concerning the ſecond difficultie, many both in the Romiſh and reformed Churches, will in no caſe admit of a miſnomer in the Evangeliſts writing, but will have the words cited by him to be the Prophet <hi>Ieremiahs</hi> owne words, though no where extant in his own works, which now we have. Yet in ſome other works of his, which no Chriſtian living this day, hath ſeene: but of which S. <hi>Hierom</hi> had ſeen an Hebrew Copy, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf relates; but unto which it doth not appeare that he gave any credit, it being imparted to him by one of the ſect of the Nazarens. The words of the pretended prophecy anſwer ſo punctually and identically to every apex or title of S. <hi>Matthews</hi> quotation or paraphraſe upon the Prophet; as we may more then ſuſpect, juſtly preſume that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage which S. <hi>Hierom</hi> relates, to have been ſquared
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:7892:158"/>
on purpoſe to S. <hi>Matthews</hi> allegation, after the publiſhing of this Goſpel. For ſuch ſuppoſititious or baſtard books, were obtruded upon the Church before S. <hi>Hieroms</hi> or <hi>Origens</hi> dayes.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt many Interpretations upon this 11. of <hi>Zachariah,</hi> which <hi>Iunius</hi> in his parallels hath dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently recited, he approves onely of one or two: the one, that <hi>Zachariah</hi> was <hi>binomius,</hi> had two names, <hi>Ieremiah</hi> and <hi>Zachariah,</hi> a thing not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in ſacred hiſtories, eſpecially where their names, whether they be two or more, have but one ſignification or importance. Now the ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologie of <hi>Ieremiah</hi> and <hi>Zachariah,</hi> according to his Interpretation of them, have the very ſame ſignification. The other which after this, <hi>Iunius</hi> likes beſt, is that <hi>Zachariah</hi> had the Prophet <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> for his Maſter or Inſtructer, though not <hi>viva voce,</hi> yet partaker of his ſpirit by tradition or undoubted relation of his propheticall predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, from ſuch as had beene acquainted with <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> during the time of <hi>Zedechiahs</hi> raigne, or in the beginning of the Babyloniſh captivitie. This good Writer was afraid leſt <hi>Ieremiah</hi> ſhould have lived too long, if he had been acquainted with <hi>Zachariah,</hi> upon his return from Babylon, or about the building of the ſecond Temple, as ſome others before <hi>Iunius</hi> had avoucht, whoſe opinion in the maine point he likes well of, to wit, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the teſtimony alledged by S. <hi>Matthew</hi> be diſtinctly found in the Prophet <hi>Zachariah,</hi> yet is aſcribed by the Evangeliſt himſelf purpoſely to <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> becauſe <hi>Zachariah</hi> had learned it from
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:7892:159"/>
                     <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> had done the end of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For my part, if I could be fully perſwaded (as I am not to the contrary) that the reaſon why S. <hi>Matthew</hi> did purpoſely aſcribe theſe words in the Prophet <hi>Zachariah,</hi> unto <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Prophet <hi>Zachariah</hi> had <hi>Ieremiah</hi> in this and many other Prophecies for his Inſtructer or guide; I ſhould think it no ſoloeciſme to ſay, that <hi>Zachariah</hi> had been acquainted with <hi>Ieremiah</hi> himſelf, either about the beginning of the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh Captivitie, or that <hi>Ieremiah</hi> had lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this peoples returne to Jeruſalem and to the Inheritance and poſſeſſions of their forefathers. For that divers of that generation, wherein <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> prophecied, and whileſt the firſt Temple was ſtanding, did live ſo long, as <hi>Iunius</hi> thinks it improbable <hi>Ieremiah</hi> ſhould live, is cleare from that of <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.12. <hi>Many of the Prieſts and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, and chief of the Fathers, who were ancient men, who had ſeen the firſt houſe; when the foundation of the houſe was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice: and many ſhouted aloud for joy.</hi> Howbeit, I am not of opinion, that men in thoſe dayes did by ſtrength of nature make up ſo many yeares here on earth, as this hiſtory implyes theſe many Prieſts and Levites did, but rather that God by his ſpeciall providence and goodneſſe, did at this time reiterate or renew that Covenant of life, which once he made to <hi>Phinehas</hi> and <hi>Eleazar.</hi> And <hi>Ieremiah</hi> and <hi>Baruch</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Neriah,</hi> had this ſpeciall priviledge beſtowed upon them, that
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:7892:159"/>
their lives ſhould be given unto them for a prey, <note n="*" place="margin">See Jer. 45. ver. 5. &amp; 39</note> in all places whither ſoever they went. Againe, it is very probable, ſeeing <hi>Ieremiah</hi> during the time of his impriſonment did by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord <hi>buy the field of Hananeel his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles ſonne, and cauſe the Evidences ſubſcribed to be put up by Earuch in an earthen veſſell, that they might continue many dayes:</hi> that hee expected to ſee the returne of this people from captivity unto the poſſeſſions of their Fathers: that hee himſelf did hope to enjoy the benefit of this his bargaine, which hee made in a ſtrange time, as worldlings would think. But ſo hee made it for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this peoples faith in Gods promiſes, that fields and poſſeſſions, which then lay deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, ſhould be repoſſeſt by this people and their poſterity: and Inheritances ſhould bee ſold and alienated to the next of kinred, (as this of <hi>Hana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neels</hi> was to <hi>Ieremiah</hi>) according to the Law.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Maldonat</hi> in his Comments upon St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> is very free, and not afraid, as <hi>Iunius</hi> and other good Writers are, to admit of a miſnomer, neither occaſioned by the Evangeliſts forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nor from miſtake of letters, or abbrevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by the Tranſcribers, but rather by a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary interſertion of the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> his name by ſome bold Tranſcriber or Interpreter, when as the Evangeliſt had onely ſaid, <hi>The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> (as his uſuall maner is) without any intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion what Prophet it was, leaving that wholly to the diligent Readers ſearch or obſervation. For ſo he doth in that remarkable Prophecie; <hi>Behold
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:7892:160"/>
a virgin ſhall conceive, and beare a Sonne, &amp;c.</hi> hee ſaith no more, then all this was foretold by the Prophet, without any mention or intimation of <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> name: nor doth hee name the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> when hee records the fulfilling of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, <hi>Out of Egypt have I called my Sonne,</hi> Matt. 2.15. And in verſe 23. of the ſame Chapter, <hi>hee ſhall bee called a</hi> NAZARENE. Hee giving the reaſon why <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> by the diſpoſition of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence did divert his intended returne unto <hi>Bethleem,</hi> where Chriſt was born, and took up his dwelling in <hi>Nazareth,</hi> ſaith this was done, <hi>that it might bee fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophets,</hi> not ſo much as intimating the name of any one Prophet, by whom this was foretold. And if the curious Reader would obſerve his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations of Propheticall teſtimonies, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his whole Goſpel, he ſhall find the Prophets name, (whoſe teſtimony hee moſt faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords) concealed or omitted three times as often, as it is expreſt. And in thoſe few places, wherein the Prophets name, whoſe authority hee alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, is expreſt, it may without any danger bee queſtioned whether they were ſo expreſt or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſerted by Interpreters or Tranſcribers. For the addition of names, or change of ſome vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, doth no way vitiate the divine truth of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie; though the cuſtome of later Interpreters or Tranſlators, bee farre more commendable to expreſſe the Prophets name, or the Chapter and verſe, to which the Evangelical ſtory referres, in the margin, not in the body of the Text, Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:7892:160"/>
the miſnomers of perſons or places inſerted to the body of the diſcourſe, doth no way corrupt the true ſenſe, and meaning, either of hiſtoricall or Propheticall truth: the errour is imputable onely to the Tranſcriber or Interpreter, not to the Author.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But for this place now in queſtion, I know it is objected by good Writers, (both as well of the Reformed, as Romiſh Church) that the moſt ancient copies of St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, have the name of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> not of <hi>Zachariah:</hi> and therefore it is a preſumption at leaſt, that the name was not interſerted by any Interpreter or Tranſcriber, but expreſt by the firſt Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Yet this is a preſumption onely, no juſt proofe, becauſe there may be for ought we know, more ancient copies of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> then any man of later yeeres hath ſeene or publiſhed to the world; as of later yeeres ſome copies of the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint and of St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Goſpel, have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto the Chriſtian world, which are more ancient, then thoſe which in former ages were moſt common. Again, no man can make ſuch proof, that any Greek Manuſcript of S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> now extant is more ancient then the Syriack Teſtament, in which the name of the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> is not to bee found, although the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of S. <hi>Matthews</hi> Text concerning the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of this Prophecie bee plaine, and full. Laſtly, I think, ſcarce any of the Romiſh Church would affirme, that ſuch Manuſcripts, as they have ſeene, are more ancient, then their firſt
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:7892:161"/>
vulgar Latin Tranſlation of the Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And now, if it bee no prejudice to the ſubſtance of truth in their moſt ancient Tranſlation, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſert names, and places, not ſo much as heard of in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, nor added by the Seventy Interpreters: or other expreſſions of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew names (uſed by <hi>Moſes</hi>) by the Grecians: but new names impoſed by the Grecians upon places otherwiſe called in more ancient times: it can no way diſparage the true ſenſe or meaning of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> although very ancient Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or Tranſcribers have interſerted the name of <hi>Ieremiah</hi> inſtead of <hi>Zachariah</hi> into the body of his Text. But where doth the moſt ancient vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Tranſlator make any ſuch interſertion of names into the body of <hi>Moſes</hi> his writings? To omit other places, ſo he doth <hi>Numb.</hi> 34.11. where we reade, as the Hebrew <hi>verbatim</hi> hath it, <hi>And the coaſt ſhall goe downe from Shepham to Riblah,</hi> the ancient vulgar Latin makes this interſertion,<note place="margin">Vide Nebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſis quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quagenam.

Greek tranſcript of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> as yet publickly knowne: the Interpreters Greek or Latine might with the ſame confidence interſert the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> his name into the body of the text, as the vulgar Latine doth the name of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Daphne</hi> into the hiſtory of <hi>Moſes.</hi> The moſt ancient and beſt Authority, which the Author of the vulgar Latine can pretend for this interſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is from the Author of the 2.

                  <p n="7">7 But whether we admit of <hi>Maldonats</hi> or <hi>Iuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> opinion, as the more probable: the third diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty propoſed will not be diſſolved by one, or both; And that was, how the Author of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, whoſe accompliſhment S. <hi>Matthew</hi> records (were it <hi>Ieremiah, Zachariah,</hi> or ſome other) ſhould ſuſtaine the perſon of <hi>Iudas</hi> the Traitor, and the perſon of our Saviour CHRIST, who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, of whom the forecited Prophecy was to be literally fulfilled. That it was fulfilled by <hi>Iudas</hi> fact, is granted by all: but how it was fulfilled of our Saviour, is a queſtion, which moſt Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters leave undetermined. For the reſolution or determination of it, there might be another que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion premiſed, to wit, whether he or they, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they were, who did foretell <hi>Iudas</hi> his caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

down the thirtie pieces of ſilver to the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Temple, did fore-ſignifie this by way of viſion, or did withall fore-picture it by like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact. But the reſolution of this latter queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (neither altogether impertinent, nor abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary) might be referred to the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the like queſtion, moved by Interpreters upon that of <hi>Hoſea</hi> 1.2. <hi>Goe, take unto thee a wife of whoredomes, and children of whoredomes: for the land hath committed great whoredome, departing from the Lord</hi> However they have determined or ſhall determine that queſtion concerning <hi>Hoſea,</hi> as whether indeed he did take a wife of fornication unto him, or onely ſpake ſymbolically, (as if his ſayings were to be conſtrued for his deeds) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the determination will determine the preſent difficulty, how either <hi>Ieremiah</hi> or <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah</hi> ſhould repreſent either our Saviour Chriſt or <hi>Iudas,</hi> either by word or deed. The ſhadow of this ſeeming ſtumbling block, hath affrighted ſome learned Commentators out of the right way, into which they had upon good deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on entred.

                  <head>CHAP. XXVIII. The cleare reſolution of the third difficulty propoſed: of the fearfull end of <hi>Judas,</hi> and how it was both forepictured, and foretold.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Hall we ſay then that either <hi>Zachariah</hi> or any other ſacred Author of the Prophecy alledged by S. <hi>Matthew</hi> did repreſent both the perſon of <hi>Iudas</hi> the Traitor, and of JESUS CHRIST whom hee betrayed? There is no neceſſity to avouch thus much: nor would it be any abſurdity to grant all this and ſomewhat more. The parallel betweene the Evangeliſt, and the prophecy of <hi>Zachariah,</hi> as now it is extant, (whether in the Hebrew or Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint) whether he onely foretold the event, or foreacted it alſo by like matter of fact, (which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is more then probable,) is moſt exact. For <hi>Zachary</hi> (as he himſelf affirmeth) did require his ſtipend for his propheticall function, <hi>and they weighed him thirty pieces of ſilver, Zacharie</hi> 11.12. But this ſtipend, after he had received it, was ſo contemptible in the ſight of the Lord, that he ſaid unto him, <hi>Caſt it unto the potter, a goodly price, that I was prized at of them. And ſo he took the thirtie pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſilver, and caſt them to the Potter in the houſe of the Lord.</hi> In thus undervaluing the Prophets perſon and paines, they did undervalue the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and perſon of that Lord, whoſe Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour he was. <hi>Iudas</hi> in like ſort <hi>goeth to the high Prieſts, and asked of them, What will ye give me, and I
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:7892:164"/>
will deliver him unto you? and they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of ſilver. Matthew</hi> 26.15. This was the higheſt price, which this laſt and worſt generation of Iſrael, did ſet upon the chief Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of their ſouls; not the hire or ſtipend for his paines: for theſe they ſet at nought. And by this act they did exactly fulfill both the Prophet <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariahs</hi> words, and the meaſure of their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſinnes, in undervaluing his miniſteriall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and perſon. The ſame Lord which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Zachariah</hi> to caſt his contemptible ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend unto the Potter, did now cauſe <hi>Iudas</hi> to throw downe the price, for which he ſold and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his Lord &amp; Maſter unto the chief Prieſts and Officers, in the ſame houſe of God or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, after he had ſeen that it was the price of his Maſters bloud, not the ſtipend onely of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery. That <hi>Iudas</hi> did thus farre repent, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his ſinne in ſaying, <hi>I have ſinned in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying innocent bloud,</hi> this was the Lords doing, or (as the Evangeliſt ſaith) <hi>that which the Lord appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to doe. Matthew</hi> 27.12. And no Chriſtian need be afraid to ſay, that <hi>Iudas</hi> was moved or appointed of the Lord, as <hi>Zacharie</hi> was, to caſt downe the thirty pieces of ſilver in the Temple, to the end, that his prophecy, and his fact might be exactly fulfilled. Their forefathers in offering unto <hi>Zachariah</hi> thirtie pieces of ſilver for his hire, did forepicture that their ungracious poſterity would ſet as low a price upon the Lord himſelf. And thoſe words of the Lord unto the Prophet, verſe 13. <hi>A goodly price that I was prized at,</hi> have
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:7892:164"/>
the ſame ſenſe, &amp; importance with the like words (before cited) <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 26 parag. 4.</note> unto <hi>Samuel, They have not caſt thee off from being King, but mee.</hi> If we compare the 13. verſe of the 11. of <hi>Zacharie</hi> with the 12, and conſider the alteration of the perſons ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, they will beare this ſenſe or importance; or rather require this conſtruction;
<q>Be content to forgoe thy ſtipend: for they have not onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued thee and thy miniſteriall paines, but they have undervalued mee. For as this preſent generation hath done by thee, ſo and much worſe will their ungracious poſteritie deale with me.</q>
This is the very brief or abſtract of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> Chap. 27. ver. 9, 10. (<hi>Then was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that which was ſpoken by the Prophet ſaying, And they took the thirty pieces of ſilver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Iſrael did value: and gave them for the Potters field, as the Lord appointed mee.</hi>) Theſe laſt words caſt a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or rather a ſtumbling block in many Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wayes, how the Prophet <hi>Zachariah</hi> ſhould be appointed of the Lord to buy the Potters field. But this is preſently take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away, if we conſider, that the Evangeliſt in the 9 and 10. verſes doth make a paraphraſe or exegeticall expoſition upon the Prophets words. Now it was ever lawfull, yea the office of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, not onely to quote the Prophets, but to paraphraſe upon or expound aſwell the literall as myſticall ſenſe of their words, or portendments of their facts. And if we conſult the Prophet himſelf in the originall, or in the Tranſlation of the Seaventie; that expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:7892:165"/>
which we have made as well of his words, as of S. <hi>Matthews</hi> paraphraſe, is moſt naturally emergent out of the Grammaticall ſignification of the words, and the perſons ſpeaking. When the Prophet ſpeaks unto the people in his owne perſon, hee ſaith, <hi>If yee think good, give mee my ſtipend or hire,</hi>

                     <hi>price, that I was prized at of them.</hi> And this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of the words perſwades mee, that the Prophet did really demand, and they did really pay his ſtipend. And in this their undervaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his perſon, and paines, they did portend their poſterities diſeſteeme of the great Prophet the Lord himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. One ſcruple yet remaines, which if I did not, every obſervant Reader of the Prophet would caſt in his owne way: and it is this; what the Prophet had to doe with any Potter in the houſe of the Lord? Some interpreters without any mention of this ſcruple, give this reaſon why God commanded the Prophet to throw his ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend to the Potter, becauſe his perſon or profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was as contemptible, as the ſtipend was. But if this was the true reaſon the party to whom hee threw it, was not contemptible onely for the meanneſſe of his perſon or profeſſion, but contemptible amongſt others of his owne trade. For the word in the Originall hath a note of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration prefixt unto it: not <hi>a</hi> Potter, but
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:7892:165"/>
                     <hi>the</hi> Potter. This ſcruple (if I miſtake not) is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready cleared in the former Book.<note place="margin">See the 7. book of Comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts on the Creed.</note> For as <hi>Vata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blus</hi> with the conſent of ſome ancient Hebrew Rabbins obſerve, the ancient reading of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew was <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> unto the Treaſury, or unto the Treaſurer. But in ſucceſſion of time there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a variation in reading, not by negligence of Tranſcribers or Tranſlators, but by Gods ſpeciall providence, [<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>]. And this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of one letter for another, or alteration of the ſignification of the words, did moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely character the devolution of the thirtie pieces of ſilver, deſigned by <hi>Iudas</hi> to the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or Corban, unto the buying of the Potters field to bury ſtrangers in it. Both <hi>Iudas,</hi> for caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them downe for the Temples uſe; and the chief Prieſts, in otherwiſe diſpoſing of them, did as the Lord had appointed them. Neither of them did amiſſe in all this. The height of their ſinne was in buying and ſelling the Lord of life, ſpecially at ſo low a price. This the Lord did not appoint, or ordaine them to doe: yet did he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine their moſt wicked deeds, and direct their malicious intentions to an happy end: to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of all our ſoules, and to the fulfilling of this Prophecy. And ſo hee did ordaine <hi>Iudas</hi> his reſolution to make away himſelf, unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of our faith, and to the fulfilling of another Prophecie, not much obſerved (for ought I read) by moſt Interpreters. The firſt and laſt act that <hi>Iudas</hi> did, after hee had caſt downe the thirty pieces of ſilver in the Temple, is recorded
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:7892:166"/>
by S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> 27.5. <hi>And he caſt downe the pieces of ſilver in the Temple, and departed, and went and hanged himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. This laſt act was prefigured, (as moſt have obſerved) by the fearefull end of <hi>Ahitophel.</hi> But was the maner of his dying, (which was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more fearefull, then <hi>Ahitophels</hi>) any where elſe foretold? Yes, it was moſt remarkably fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prophecied Pſalme 109. with its circumſtances, or ſad conſequences. Firſt, that the imprecations throughout that Pſalme were literally meant of <hi>Iudas,</hi> though his name bee not expreſt in it, is cleare from St. <hi>Peters</hi> ſpeach unto the Aſſembly of Chriſts Diſciples, for proceeding to the election of another Apoſtle, in <hi>Iudas</hi> his place; <hi>And in thoſe dayes Peter ſtood up in the midſt of the Diſciples and ſaid, (The number of the names together were about an hundred and twentie) Men, and Brethren, this Scripture muſt needs have been fulfilled, which the holy Ghoſt by the mouth of David ſpake before concerning Iudas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">S. <hi>Matthew</hi> addes, and ſaith it was called <hi>the field of blood unto this day:</hi> which argues that he wrote his Goſpel a long time after S. <hi>Peter</hi> made his Comment upon the Pſalmiſt.</note> 
                     <hi>which was guide to them that tooke Ieſus. For he was numbred with us, and had obtained part of this miniſterie. Now this man purchaſed a field with the reward of iniquity, and falling headlong hee burſt aſunder in the midſt, and all his bowels guſhed out: and it was knowen unto all the dwellers at Ieruſalem, inſomuch, as that field in their proper tongue is called Aceldama, that is to ſay, The field of blood. For it is written in the Book of Pſalmes, Let his habitation be deſolate, and let no man dwell therein. And his Biſhoprick let another take,</hi> Acts 1.15, 16, 17. Albeit the chief
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:7892:166"/>
Prieſt did bargaine for the field to bury ſtrangers in, yet in aſmuch, as the money wherewith they bought it, was <hi>Iudas</hi> his goods, not theirs; St. <hi>Peter</hi> held it no ſoloeciſme to ſay, that <hi>this man,</hi> (to wit, <hi>Iudas) did purchaſe a field with the reward of iniquity.</hi> And ſeeing this field was purchaſed of a Potter, it is but one and the ſame maner of ſpeach, which S. <hi>Matthew</hi> uſeth (by way of para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe upon the Prophet <hi>Zachariah,</hi>) that <hi>Iudas did caſt downe the thirty pieces of ſilver to the Potter in the houſe of the Lord.</hi> S. <hi>Matthew</hi> relates onely <hi>Iudas</hi> his hanging of himſelf: S. <hi>Peter</hi> addes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>that falling headlong, hee burſt aſunder in the midſt, and all his bowels guſhed out.</hi> It ſeemes, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is evident, that either the rope or the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low tree did break: the later is more probable, if any heed bee to bee given to an old tradition, that he made choiſe of an Elder tree for the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; a very brittle wood, and ſuch as beares no good fruit, unleſſe it bee that which is called the Jews-eare. But although we be bound to beleeve, that moſt of the imprecations in this Pſalme were literally, and concludently meant of <hi>Iudas</hi>; yet it may be queſtioned, whether they were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally meant of him alone, or directly intended againſt his perſon by the Prophet <hi>David.</hi> And however it was lawfull for the Prophets to pray directly againſt particular perſons living in their owne time (which for any Chriſtian living to doe is moſt abominable:) yet for the particular imprecations of this and ſome other Pſalmiſts, which were not fulfilled till after ages, I cannot
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:7892:167"/>
but highly approve of <hi>Genebrards</hi> reſolution up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Pſalme. The extract of his reſolution is, that however <hi>David</hi> might have juſt occaſions to ſupplicat for revenge upon ſome enemies to him, and to his Government, and to the God of Iſrael whoſe Deputy he was: Yet his direfull impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions throughout this Pſalme, aimes at the whole hoaſt of impiety, or the body of impious men. And ſeeing <hi>Iudas</hi> was the chief or higheſt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of that huge body with whom hee fought: the curſes which he ſent forth at randome (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of future ages) did fall perpendicularly and moſt punctually, in fulleſt meaſure, upon this eminent Traytor to his King and Countrey; to his Lord God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. All the imprecations throughout this Pſalme are Propheticall, and have been (at leaſt reſpectively) long agoe fulfilled; but in which of them, the maner of this Traitors fearefull end was in particular punctually foretold, is not ſo cleare, as that the ordinary Reader will eaſily ſee it. Nor can hee be much holpen by any diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of moſt Interpreters. Many beſides <hi>Iudas</hi> have hanged themſelves: many have been ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by ſudden death, or ſmitten by Gods reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging arrow, with ſore diſeaſes in a moment. Yet have wee read of none, in whoſe death, ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and ſecret acute diſeaſes did ſo concurre as they did in <hi>Iudas.</hi> His owne intention was onely to hang himſelf, and this he effected. But certainely there was ſomewhat more in it, then could naturally follow from this attempt; as that
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:7892:167"/>
hee ſhould burſt aſunder in the middle, that all his bowels ſhould guſh out, and haſten his death before the ordinary time of expiration by the ordinary courſe of nature in ſuch, as die that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall and accurſed death, which he ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But the Pſalmiſt had thus prophecied and prayed againſt him, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 109.17. <hi>As he loved curſing, ſo let it come unto him: as hee delighted not in bleſsing, ſo let it bee farre from him. As hee clothed himſelf with curſing, like as with his garment; ſo let it come into his bowels like water, and like oile into his bones.</hi> Yet do we not reade, nor have we any occaſion to ſuſpect, that <hi>Iudas</hi> being a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of the bleſſed Apoſtles till his death, and a continuall follower of Chriſt the bleſſed whilſt hee lived on earth; was accuſtomed to ſweare, curſe, or blaſpheme. His demeanor amongſt them (doubtleſſe) was civill, not prophane. How then were the Pſalmiſts words punctually veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of him; <hi>He loved curſing: he delighted not in bleſsing?</hi> The meaning is, (as in many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Pſalmiſts) that however hee did not openly ſweare, curſe, or blaſpheme, or bewray his hate to goodneſſe: yet in his heart hee did abhorre the wayes, which tend to peace and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, and ſet himſelf not immediatly or direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to curſedneſſe. How then is he ſaid to have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved curſing? Becauſe through avarice, and ſtiffe adherence to ſiniſter privat ends, which hee had ſecretly propoſed unto himſelf; hee was diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the wayes of peace and happineſſe, (which is the end, that all men in the generall
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:7892:168"/>
ſeek and wiſh for) unto the crooked paths which <hi>winde</hi> to curſedneſſe and malediction. As his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to theſe paths was ſecret and hid, ſo was the diſeaſe whereof he died. It gathered ſecretly, though ſuddenly within his body. It ſoaked like oile into his bones, and into his bowells like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And as a good Author (whoſe words, and name I now remember not) hath conjectured, he died of a dropſie more acute and ſudden, then that diſeaſe naturally is. Yet however it bred within him, by cauſes naturall or ſupernaturall, it might be the true and naturall cauſe of his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in the middle, and of the guſhing out of his bowels. Of his ſudden diſeaſe and deſtruction, other Pſalmiſts had likewiſe prophecied.<note place="margin">See Pſal. 55.16.</note> Now that theſe and the like Propheticall imprecations might be exactly and remarkably fulfilled in him; the righteous Lord would not ſuffer him to die meerely of ſtrangling or ſuffocation, but ſmote him with theſe ſecret and ſudden diſeaſes; of what kind ſoever they were.</p>

For he might ride part of the way upon the one, and part upon the other. In like manner ſeeing his progreſſe from the Common hall unto <hi>Golgotha,</hi> was diviſible, as the locall diſtance between them was, our Saviour himſelf might beare his Croſſe ſome part of the way, or for a while: and <hi>Simon</hi>
                     <pb n="329" facs="tcp:7892:169"/>
the Cyrenian perhaps a greater part of the way, or for a longer time. Againe, ſeeing the Croſſe it ſelfe was not onely diviſible but actually divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, our Saviour might beare one part of it all the way, and <hi>Simon</hi> another for the moſt part of the way betweene the <hi>Praetorium</hi> and <hi>Golgotha.</hi> Nor is it probable that either of them ſhould for any time, or for any portion of the way beare both the whole Croſſe, and the Chapiter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the title of his accuſation was engroſt by Pilar [<hi>Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iews.</hi>] That our Saviour did beare his Croſſe out of the <hi>Praetorium</hi> or place of Judicature, is cleare from the foreci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted place of S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> And it is more then proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that he did beare it all along the City, till he came to the publique gate, where the Souldiers meeting with <hi>Simon</hi> comming out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, compell him to goe back againe with them, and beare the Croſſe to <hi>Golgotha. And as they came out</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Matthew</hi>) or rather as they were comming forth (not from the <hi>Praetorium</hi> or Common-hall, but from the gates of the City) <hi>they found a man of Cyrene, him they compeld to beare his Croſſe.</hi> It is cleare againe frome S. <hi>Luke</hi> 23.26. that <hi>Simon</hi> did beare the Croſſe, JESUS going before him. Whether our Saviour did faint under it at the gate through feebleneſſe of body, or by long watching, I will not diſpute, much leſſe determine; though ſome good Writers give this reaſon why <hi>Simon</hi> was compeld to beare it, being firſt laid upon our Saviour. But whether for this reaſon or ſome other, they took it from our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:7892:170"/>
ſhoulders, and laid it upon <hi>Simons</hi>; there was a myſterie in it, and at leaſt, an Emblemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call expreſſion of what our Saviour before had ſaid, <hi>If any man will bee my Diſciple, let him take up his croſſe, and follow me.</hi> For this <hi>Simon</hi> queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe either had been one of Chriſts Diſciples before, or at this time became one, as his two ſons <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Rufus</hi> were, when S. <hi>Mark</hi> did write his Goſpel. But it is very probable that they knew him for one of his Diſciples, and for this reaſon compeld him to beare his Croſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not willing of himſelf to doe them any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in ſuch a wicked employment. Now though this man did meet JESUS, when hee was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the gate, (as we would ſay) by meere 2chance or fortune, that is, without any intention or forecaſt on his part ſo to doe; yet even this contingency was determined, and the thing it ſelf intended by Divine providence, that wee might have a viſible paterne ſet by this man, (though againſt his will) of that duty or ſervice, which the Apoſtle preſcribeth to all that intend to be Chriſts true Diſciples. <hi>Ieſus, that he might ſanctifie the people with his owne blood, ſuffered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the gate. Let us goe forth therefore unto him without the gate, bearing his reproach,</hi> Heb. 13.12, 13. Wee muſt doe that willingly which this man was compelled to doe; that is, renounce our intended wayes, and follow him, as this man did, bearing his Croſſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. After he was come to <hi>Golgotha,</hi> but before he was nailed to the Croſſe; <hi>they gave him wine
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:7892:170"/>
mingled with gall</hi> (as S. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith) or (as S. <hi>Mark) with myrrhe.</hi> With what intention they miniſtred this bitter cup unto him, hee beſt knows: Not for his comfort (as I conjecture) but rather to adde gall unto wormewood, or to make the potion more loathſome unto him by theſe two bitter ingredients. For thus much the Pſalmiſts words, (which were now in part ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled of him) imply: <hi>I looked for ſome to take pity, but there was none, and for comforters but I found none. They gave mee alſo gall for my meat, and in my thirſt they gave mee vineger to drinke, Pſalm.</hi> 69.20, 21. Whether the other two which were crucified with him, had the like cup mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred unto them, is uncertaine: but the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts take no notice of what was done to them. Myrrhe mingled with wine being in ſome caſes a ſtrengthener, might bee offered to them, that they might die more couragiouſly: and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours mingled with myrrhe and gall, that the Pſalmiſts complaint might bee more remarkably fulfilled in him, <hi>poſuerunt fel in eſcam meam. When hee had taſted of this bitter cup</hi>; (ſaith S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew) hee would not drink,</hi> 27.34. <hi>They gave him to drink</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Mark) wine mingled with myrrhe, but hee received it not,</hi> 15.23. To taſte of it, and not to drink of it, (as S. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith) was not to receive it, or not to accept of it: ſo that there is no apparance of contradiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe two Evangeliſts; both of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the ſame truth: but neither of them the ſame truth fully. S. <hi>Mark</hi> omits the mingling of
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:7892:171"/>
the wine with gall; S. <hi>Matthew</hi> the mingling of it with myrrhe, and his not receiving of it: or rather to taſte of it, not to drink of it, was both to receive it, and not to receive it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the Lord was crucified betwixt two malefactors, all the Evangeliſts agree without any variation in words: but the circumſtance or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of time wherein they were crucified, is not ſo punctually ſet downe by any of the Evangeliſts, as the circumſtance or order of place. They were crucified all together, one neare to another; yet one after another in reſpect of time. <hi>Then were there two theeves crucified with him</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew) one on the right hand, and another on the left,</hi> 27.38. This ſeemes to imply that our Saviour was the firſt that was crucified. So doth S. <hi>Marks</hi> relation, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.27. <hi>And with him they crucified two theeves, one on the right hand, and another on the left.</hi> Nor doth S. <hi>Luke</hi> any way vary from theſe two Evangeliſts, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.32, 33. <hi>And there were alſo two other malefactors led with him to bee put to death. And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary; there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and another on the left.</hi> The crucifying of the Sonne of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two notorious malefactors, (as bad, if not worſe then <hi>Barabbas</hi> was) upon a croſſe, (as is probable) ſomewhat higher then the other two, was ſo plainely foretold by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Chap.</hi> 53. that his Prophecy needs no other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then that which S. <hi>Mark</hi> hath made upon this circumſtance of place, wherein hee was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:7892:171"/>
                     <hi>And the Scripture was fulfilled which ſaith, And he was numbred with the tranſgreſſors,</hi> or, as the vulgar hath it, <hi>Et cum ſceleratis reputatus eſt</hi>; Hee was not onely ſentenced to death, but reputed alſo by the multitude as a notorious Malefactor; and for this reaſon crucified in the middle, and upon an higher Croſſe. For this prerogative, or preeminence of place in capitall puniſhments, was by the cuſtome of thoſe times, and by other Nations ſince, allotted to the principall offenders or Ringleaders in mutinies, treaſons, or rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now our Saviour (as the ſuperſcription of his Croſſe doth witneſſe,) was put to death for high treaſon. <hi>This is Ieſus of Nazareth</hi> (or Jeſus the Nazaren) <hi>the King of the Iews.</hi> This was the entire title, or full inſcription, as the Reader will eaſily conceive, if he compare the foure Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts together, albeit none of them taken alone doth expreſſe ſo much.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It might more eaſily bee queſtioned then reſolved (for the Evangeliſts ſay nothing expreſly one way or other) whether <hi>Pilat</hi> himſelfe did write this title, or cauſed it to be written by ſome under-Officer of the Court: or whether it were firſt written in the Court of Juſtice, or at the place of execution. <hi>Pilat</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Iohn) wrote a title, and put it on the Croſſe, and the writing was</hi> JESUS of NAZARETH King of the Jews. <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.19. The ſuperſcription of his accuſation was (ſaith S. <hi>Mark) The King of the Iews, Chap.</hi> 15.26. To mee it ſeemes probable that this title was written or dictated by <hi>Pilat</hi> in the place of
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:7892:172"/>
Judicature, becauſe I finde no probable reaſon to conjecture that <hi>Pilat</hi> ſhould be preſent in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at the place of execution. It is probable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine from S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> that the table or chapiter, wherein this title was written, was not ſet up till after hee was crucified: <hi>Sitting downe, they watched there, and ſet over his head his accuſation written, This is Ieſus the King of the Iews,</hi> Matt. 27.36, 37. And S. <hi>Iohns</hi> words <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.20. to my apprehenſion doe more then intimate, that few or none beſides <hi>Pilat</hi> himſelf did know of this inſcription, before the Croſſe was pitched, and our Saviour nailed unto it. <hi>This title</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>then read many of the Iews: for the place where Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was crucified, was nigh to the Citie.</hi> To what theſe laſt words ſhould referre I cannot conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, unleſſe it bee to give us notice, that the Jews which read this title might ſpeedily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the high Prieſts what <hi>Pilat</hi> had written, and they as ſpeedily intreat <hi>Pilat</hi> (as they boldly did) to correct or amend this ſuperſcription: for ſo it immediatly follows in the Evangeliſt; <hi>Then ſaid the chief Prieſts of the Iews to Pilat, Write not, the King of the Iews, but that hee ſaid, I am the King of the Iews. But Pilat anſwered, What I have written, I have written,</hi> verſe 23. The ſame Lord who had made <hi>Caiaphas</hi> not long before to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, did now guide <hi>Pilats</hi> hands and thoughts (though not to prophecie, yet) to proclaime unto the world in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, that this harmeleſſe man whom they had firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in their owne Conſiſtory for blaſphemy
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:7892:172"/>
againſt God; and afterwards indited of high treaſon againſt <hi>Caeſar</hi>; was indeed their true and lawfull King: a greater and more juſt King then <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf was; and (as the Centurion after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards confeſſed) <hi>the very Sonne of God.</hi> Whether the title and inſcription of the crimes, and names of the parties crucified were uſuall amongſt the Romans, or uſed at this time onely, and that over our Saviours head alone, I leave unto the Readers ſearch, or to ſuch as have leiſure to ſtudy Roman rites or Antiquities.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Pilat</hi> in all probability did write, or cauſe to bee written this ſuperſcription, to avoid the calumniations of the Jews before the Roman <hi>Caeſar,</hi> unto whoſe accuſations hee had beene the more liable, if he had ſuffered the crime preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by them to have ſlept, or buried it in ſilence without any publique Record, that hee had pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed JESUS of NAZARETH, as a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to the Roman Emperour. <hi>After</hi> this inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his accuſation was ſet up over his head, <hi>they that paſſed by reviled him wagging their heads, ſaying, Thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple, and buildeſt it in three dayes, ſave thy ſelf. If thou be the Sonne of God come downe from the Croſſe. Likewiſe alſo the chief Prieſts mocking him, with the Scribes and Elders ſaid: Hee ſaved others, himſelf hee cannot ſave. If hee be the King of Iſrael, let him now come downe from the Croſſe, and we will beleeve him: hee truſted in God, let him deliver him now, if hee will have him; for he ſaid, I am the Sonne of God,</hi> Matt. 27.39, 40, &amp;c. All theſe, and the like indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:7892:173"/>
done unto him betwixt the time of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription over his Croſſe untill the ſixth houre, are ſo clearely and punctually foretold by the Author of the 22. Pſalme, that it might well be queſtioned, whether the Pſalmiſt did ſpeake all this in the perſon of Chriſt alone, or reſpectively of himſelf: that is in other termes, whether this Pſalme was meerely propheticall as that 53. <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (for ought I conceive) is: or typically propheticall. I rather aſſent unto their opinion, who grant this Pſalme to be meant (for the moſt part at leaſt) of <hi>David</hi> himſelf; or of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, whoſoever hee was, according to the literall or hiſtoricall ſenſe, though more exactly by much to be fulfilled according both to the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall and exquiſite literall ſenſe in that Sonne of <hi>David,</hi> of whom <hi>David</hi> himſelfe and moſt of the Prophets in their extreameſt ſufferings were but types or ſhadows. Unto whoſe Poeticall or hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolicall expreſſions of their perſonall grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in their ſeverall generations, the perſonall ſufferings of the Sonne of God were in ſucceſſion of time to be commenſurably fitted, after ſuch a maner, as a body in his groweth is to the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which in its infancy was farre too wide for it. Some paſſages in this Pſalme there are, which cannot in any ſenſe befit our Saviour, but the Pſalmiſt alone; ſome againe which fit our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our much better then they did this Pſalmiſt or any other propheticall type or ſhadow of him. Such are the caſting of lots upon his veſture; the piercing of his hands and feet. But what occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:7892:173"/>
ſoever this Pſalmiſt had to utter the like complaints, there is no character either of deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or murmuring againſt his God in theſe his afflictions throughout this whole Pſalme: Much leſſe was there any inclination either to deſpaire or impatience, in the Sonne of God in whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone this Pſalme was exactly fulfilled. Neither was this Pſalme, or any other to bee fulfilled in him, or by him according to the characters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience or leaſt intimation of doubt or deſpaire in this Pſalmiſt; but according to their cheerefull embracements of their preſent afflictions and croſſes, according to their confidence and hope of deliverance from them, and exaltation or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration into Gods moſt ſpeciall favour after them. All the delineations or characters of heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call qualities in the Pſalmiſts, were to be ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially and exactly fulfilled in the Sonne of God. The concluſion of the latter part of this Pſalme from the 21. <hi>verſe</hi> to the end is full of hope and comfort on the Pſalmiſts owne part; and a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Prophecie of the victory, which the Sonne of God, of whom he was the type or ſhadow, ſhould obtaine over death, paines, and ſorrows more grievous then hee himſelf did ſuffer. In this viſion of the Sonne of Gods victory over all theſe, <hi>David</hi> did foreſee and rejoyced to foreſee his owne redemption from the preſent griefs and ſorrows of heart, with which hee was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed. Briefly, this 22. Pſalme from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the end lies under the ſelf ſame obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the <note n="*" place="margin">See the 7. book of theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries. ſect. 3. cap. 28. ſect;. 5.</note> ſixteenth Pſalme, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

all queſtion was penned by <hi>David</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But ſeeing it is to be confeſſed by all, that the moſt part of our Saviours ſufferings upon the Croſſe, whether inwardly in body, or in curſed ſpeeches, revilings, and taunts; are moſt clearely foretold in that 22. Pſalme: This miniſtred to me an occaſion of a new <hi>quaere,</hi> why our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our (during all the time of his lingring paines upon the Croſſe) ſhould rehearſe onely the firſt words of this Pſalme: and why them onely, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the reſt, which did literally and exactly concerne him, had been viſibly and audibly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in his bodily ſufferances, grievous paines, and other indignities done unto him. Why did hee not repeat that part of this Pſalme, [<hi>They pierced my hands and my feet,</hi>] when they firſt nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him unto the Croſſe? or why not the 18. <hi>verſe, They parted my garments, &amp;c.</hi> at that inſtant, wherein the Souldiers caſt lots, whoſe his veſture ſhould bee? or why not the 7. and the 8. <hi>verſes</hi> of the ſame Pſalme, <hi>All they that ſee me, laugh mee to ſcorne: they ſhoot out their lips: they ſhake their heads, ſaying, [He truſted in the Lord;]</hi> at that very time, when they that paſſed by, and the Prieſts and Elders that ſtood by the Croſſe, reviled him, wagging their heads? All theſe indignities were done unto him before the ſixth houre, and in the open Sunne: whereas he did not utter the words of complaint, wherewith the Pſalmiſt beginneth his Pſalme, untill the ninth houre. <hi>When the ſixth houre was come,</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Mark) there was darkneſſe
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:7892:174"/>
over the whole land untill the ninth houre. And at the ninth houre Ieſus cried with a loud voice, ſaying, Eloi, Eloi lamaſabacthani, which is being interpreted, My God, my God why haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi> Mark. 15.33, 34. S. <hi>Matthew</hi> relateth the ſame ſtory, in the ſame order, and circumſtance of time, onely with this variation in words, <hi>Eli, Eli lama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabacthani? Matt.</hi> 27.46. S. <hi>Mark</hi> it ſeemes, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the words in the Syriack or Chaldee then uſuall: S. <hi>Matthew</hi> in the ſame ſyllables our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſpoke them, and as they are in the Pſalmiſt; for <hi>Eli</hi> comes neerer to the name of <hi>Elias</hi> then <hi>Eloi:</hi> and might more eaſily occaſion that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in the multitude, which both the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts relate; then if hee had cried <hi>Eloi:</hi> for that was the uſuall appellation of God in thoſe times. <hi>Some of them that ſtood by</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Mark) when they heard it, ſaid, Behold he calleth Elias,</hi> Mark 15.35. <hi>Some of them</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Matthew) that ſtood there, when they heard that, ſaid, This man calleth for Elias. And ſtraightway, one of them ranne and took a ſponge, and filled it with vineger, and put it on a reed, and gave it him to drink: the reſt ſaid, Let bee; let us ſee, whether Elias will come to ſave him, Matth.</hi> 27.47, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Betweene S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and S. <hi>Mark</hi> in this laſt clauſe, concerning vinegar which was given unto him; there is ſome varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in words. <hi>And one ranne</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Mark) and filled a ſponge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, ſaying, Let alone, let us ſee whether Elias will come to take him downe,</hi> Mark 15.36. S. <hi>Mark</hi> appropriateth that ſpeech unto the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:7892:175"/>
party, which ranne to give him vinegar, which S. <hi>Matthew</hi> aſcribeth to the reſt of the multitude ſeeking (as his words ſeeme to import) to inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite him from doing that which he did. This va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation in words betwixt theſe two Evangeliſts, hath occaſioned a queſtion more proper to the Schooles of Phyſick then of Divinity, as <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the drinking of vinegar be more effectuall to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long life, or haſten death in bodies fainting, ſpecially for want of blood.</hi> S. <hi>Marks</hi> relation ſeemeth to imply that the intention of the party, which rann to give him vinegar, was to prolong his life for a while, to trie whether <hi>Elias</hi> would come, and take him downe from the Croſſe. But from S. <hi>Matthews</hi> relation of the ſame ſtory, it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the multitude which heard him utter theſe words. <hi>My God, my God why haſt thou forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken mee</hi>? did preſume that vinegar would ſhorten his life; and for this reaſon, as much as in them lay, did inhibite the other to give him vinegar, leſt it might have been replied, that <hi>Elias</hi> would have come to releeve him, if he had not haſtned his death. But vinegar as it is thought by <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf, (if ſome good Commentators doe not miſquote him) mingled with hyſſop, is a ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thener; and that the veſſell of vinegar which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith ſtood by the Croſſe, was ſet there on purpoſe to keepe ſuch as were crucified from fainting. However, there is no contradiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Evangeliſts. For the multitude did therefore inhibite him, that ranne for vinegar, leſt by thus doing, hee ſhould prolong his life;
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:7892:175"/>
as if they had ſaid. Seeing he calls for <hi>Elias,</hi> ſtay thine hand, and ſee whether <hi>Elias</hi> will come to recover him in his fainting. And he which gave him vinegar, after he had given it him, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme himſelf unto the reſt, as if hee had ſaid; I have done this kindneſſe for him to prolong his life a while, let us ſee whether <hi>Elias</hi> will come and take him downe, and free him from the Croſſe. The truth is, that albeit he which made ſuch haſt to miniſter vinegar unto him, did doe this feat at the ſame time, or about that inſtant wherein our Saviour cried out, <hi>Eli, Eli lama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabacthani</hi>; yet this exclamation did no way cauſe him to make ſuch ſpeed, but rather moved the reſt which heard theſe words (perhaps better then hee did,) to diſſwade him from doing that which he intended upon another occaſion. That which moved him to doe, as he did, was another ſpeech of our Saviours uttered by him, when he was on the Croſſe; either immediatly before, or immediately after hee cried out, <hi>Eli, Eli, &amp;c.</hi> though not with ſuch a loud voice, as hee uttered that. And this ſpeech is mentioned onely by S. <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.28, 29. <hi>Ieſus knowing that all things were now accompliſhed, that the Scripture might bee ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled ſaid, I thirſt. Now there was a veſſell full of vinegar, and they filled a ſpunge full of vinegar, and put it upon hyſſope, and put it to his mouth. When Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus therefore had received the vinegar, he ſaid, It is finiſhed.</hi> So that the intention of him that filled the ſpunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyſſop, and put it to his mouth, was to quench his thirſt
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:7892:176"/>
whereof hee complained. But whether St. <hi>Iohn</hi> meaneth the ſame thing by hyſſop, which the other two Evangeliſts meane by the reed: or whether <gap reason="foreign">

As after his faſting forty dayes in the wilderneſſe, hee was tempted with hunger: ſo after his lingring paines upon the Croſſe, hee was truely thirſty: and upon this ſenſible experience of the greateſt bodily grievance that can befall a man, hee ſaid, I am athirſt, but not with a loud voice or exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Whether he firſt ſaid, I am a thirſt, and then cried out with a loud voice, <hi>My God, My God why haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi> Or firſt cried out. <hi>My God, my God why haſt thou forſaken mee</hi>? and then ſaid, <hi>I am athirſt,</hi> I will not diſpute, becauſe I cannot determine. The later of the two ſeemeth to mee more probable. However; neither his ſpeech nor exclamation intimate any touch of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, much leſſe of deſpaire; but onely a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to give the world notice that this 22. Pſalme was ſpecially meant of him; and that all which was meant of him concerning his humiliation or indignities done unto him upon the Croſſe, were now fulfilled; and that there remained one or two ſayings of the ſame or ſome other Pſalmiſt to bee fulfilled before his death, eſpecially by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving

the vinegar. For <hi>when hee had received it,</hi> (ſaith S, <hi>Iohn) he ſaid,</hi> Conſummatum eſt, <hi>It is finiſhed</hi>; as if he had ſaid, Now my ſufferings and indignities are at an end. Yet beſides the bodily thirſt, wherewith hee was at the ninth houre more deepely touched, then with hunger in the wilderneſſe, there was a thirſty deſire of his ſoule to be diſſolved from the body, and to be with his Father. And in this his laſt extremity, that other complaint of <hi>David</hi> was moſt exactly fulfilled, <hi>I ſtretch forth my hands unto thee: my ſoule thirſteth after thee, as a thirſty land. Heare mee ſpeedily, O Lord, my ſpirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, leſt I be like unto them that goe downe into the pit.

And albeit S. <hi>Iohn</hi> inſtructeth us, that after he had received the vinegar, and ſaid, It is finiſhed;<note place="margin">Mat. 27.50 Mat. 15.37</note> he gave up the Ghoſt: Yet S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and S. <hi>Mark</hi> tell us, that hee cried againe with a loud voice, and ſo gave up the Ghoſt. The arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of this loud voice or cry, is regiſtred onely by S. <hi>Luke</hi> 23.46. <hi>And when Ieſus had cried with a loud voice, hee ſaid, Father, into thine hands I commend my ſpirit. And having ſaid thus, hee gave up the Ghoſt.</hi> And in this cry or ſpeech, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Scripture or prayer of <hi>David</hi> was exactly fulfilled, <hi>Pull mee out of the net that they have laid
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:7892:177"/>
privily for mee: for thou art my ſtrength. Into thine hands I commend my Spirit,</hi> Pſalm. 31.4, 5. But how was this fulfilled in him? Surely as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, or the Holy Ghoſt by whom hee ſpake, did meane it. How then was it meant of him? Not meerely Prophetically, but typically of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, and more really and punctually of <hi>him.</hi> The Pſalmiſt in his owne perſon, or as acting his owne part, did commend his Spirit to God his Redeemer, in hope to be redeemed from death, or danger of body intended againſt him. The Redeemer of Mankind uſing the ſame words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired bodily death, or diſſolution of body and ſoule, commending his ſoule or ſpirit by a dying wiſh into his Fathers hands.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The 143. Pſalme (as the inſcription of the Septuagint informeth us) was compoſed by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> when his Sonne <hi>Abſalom</hi> with his complices did purſue him: and the ſixth verſe, <hi>I ſtretch out my hands, &amp;c.</hi> is ſigned with a <hi>Selah,</hi> a note, or character as I take it, (not of muſick onely) but of ſome greater myſtery to be fulfilled. The my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie in this particular was this, that as <hi>David</hi> after hee had in his owne perſon prayed for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and was heard; ſo was the Sonne of <hi>David</hi> inſtantly after hee had received the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, delivered from the torments of death or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily paines. <hi>When Ieſus therefore had received the vinegar</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Iohn) hee ſaid, It is finiſhed: and hee bowed his head, and gave up the Ghoſt,</hi> 19.30. If we conſider either the 143. Pſalme, or the 31. as literally meant of <hi>David</hi>: there is no intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:7892:178"/>
of any diſtraction of mind in him; much leſſe was there any inclination to any diſtraction, diſcontent or diſtruſt, in JESUS the Sonne of GOD, in whom whatſoever was commendably acted by <hi>David</hi> in his diſtreſſe, was moſt punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and exquiſitely fulfilled of this our bleſſed Saviour in all his ſufferings. His memory was moſt freſh, and his patience moſt remarkable, when his mortall ſpirits were expiring.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. That ejaculation, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 31.6. <hi>Into thy hands I commend my ſpirit</hi>; was (ſaith <hi>Maldonat</hi>) meant of Chriſt in another ſenſe, then it was of <hi>David</hi>: rather fulfilled of Chriſt in a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite ſenſe, then it had been verified of <hi>David. David</hi> according to the literall and hiſtoricall ſenſe being in diſtreſſe, commends the tuition or ſafety of his ſoule unto God, directing his prayer for ſpeedy deliverance from that bodily danger, wherewith hee was beſet, unto <hi>Adonai Iehova</hi> unto the Lord of truth, or the Lord God his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. <hi>Pull mee out of the net, that they have laid privily for mee: for thou art my ſtrength, &amp;c. Thou haſt redeemed me, O Lord of truth,</hi> Pſal. 31.4, 5. The Lord God Redeemer of mankind directs his prayer unto his Father, <hi>Father into thy hands I commend my ſpirit,</hi> after hee had ſuffered all the diſgraces, paines, and tortures, whereof any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall body was ever capable. This delivery, or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of his life, and ſoule <hi>vivâ voce,</hi> at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment or point of death, into his Fathers hands, did move the heathen Centurion to ſay, <hi>Of a truth, this man was the Son of God,</hi> Mar. 15.39.
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:7892:178"/>
                     <hi>When the Centurion</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Luke) ſaw what was done, he glorified God, ſaying, Certainely this was a righteous man,</hi> Luk. 23.47. This is in effect the very ſame which S. <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith. For, in that the Centurion did acknowledge him for a righteous man; he did neceſſarily in his heart acknowledge him to bee the Sonne of God, becauſe hee had ſo profeſt of himſelf. That righteouſneſſe, which the Centurion aſcribeth unto him, was the truth of his confeſſion before Pilat, when hee was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined upon this interrogatory, [<hi>Art thou then the Sonne of God?</hi>] now more fully proved and declared unto the world by the ſtrange maner of his death.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The confeſſion of this heathen man, was more Chriſtian, then the queſtions, which ſome Schoolemen have moved upon the delivery of his ſoule <hi>vivâ voce</hi> into his Fathers hands. For ſo, ſome have queſtioned, whether he were <hi>homicida ſui,</hi> or made away himſelf by actuall diſſolution of his ſoule from his body, before the violence and cruelty of the tortures whereto his Enemies put him, could by courſe of nature work this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce. Surely, if hee did any way prevent the death intended againſt him by the Jews, or ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his owne naturall life, though but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they had not been ſo true, and proper murderers of him, as the Apoſtle intimateth, and we Chriſtians beleeve they were. For albeit <hi>Abimelech</hi> had received a deadly incurable wound by the hands of a woman; yet hee died by the hands of his Page or Armour-bearer: <hi>And a
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:7892:179"/>
certaine woman caſt a piece of a milſtone upon Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lechs head, and all to brake his ſcull. Then hee called haſtily unto the young man his Armour-bearer, and ſaid unto him, Draw out thy ſword and ſlay mee; that men ſay not of me, A woman ſlew him. And his young man thruſt him through, and hee died,</hi> Judg. 9.53, 54. But as ſome Schoolemen have in the diſquiſition of this point gone too farre: ſo others have acutely reſolved the difficulty, and elegantly reconciled the difference in opinions. <hi>Mors Chriſti non fuit verè miraculoſa, erat tamen miraculum in morte Chriſti.</hi> Chriſt did no way make away himſelf, or die by miracle, but by courſe of nature; Yet was it a true miracle, that his life and ſpirits being ſo farre ſpent, he ſhould have ſpeech and memory ſo perfect, as to make delivery of his ſoule into his Fathers hands <hi>viva voce,</hi> at the very moment of his expiration. The Jews, and Romans did truely, and properly take away his life; and yet hee did as truely and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>animam ponere,</hi> lay downe his life for his ſheepe, in that hee patiently ſubmitted himſelf to their tyrannicall cruelty: and more ſweetly and placidly reſigned up his ſoule into his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hands at the inſtant of death by courſe of nature, or perhaps a little after it, than a ſheepe doth his fleece unto the ſhearer or his owner. In this reſignation or bequeathing of his ſoule thus placidly into his Fathers hands, in his inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table patience in all his ſufferings, whether of torture or indignities, there was a moſt exact concurrence, (or coincidence rather) of all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:7892:179"/>
ſacrifices and obedience; more then the quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of thoſe ſacrifices, wherewith God was alwayes beſt pleaſed, that is, the ſacrifice of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite ſpirit, and broken heart not humbled, but humbling it ſelf unto death. The moſt ful and proper ſatisfactory ſacrifice, that could be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by God or deſired by man: a ſacrifice ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, as no wiſedome beſides wiſedome truely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, could have conceived: no perſon beſides the perſon of him that was truly God, could have offered or performed.</p>

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:7892:180"/>
whereon the Temple ſtood, or ſome Mount neer unto it, if not Calvary it ſelf. <hi>And when</hi> Abraham <hi>came neere to the foot of the Mount</hi> (which of the Mountains of Moriah ſoever it were) <hi>he laid the wood for the burnt offering on</hi> Iſaac <hi>his ſonne</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 22.</note>. <hi>Iſaac</hi> then bare his croſſe unwittingly, and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards willing by gentle perſwaſions to die upon the wood, which he bare. For if he had deteſted or abhorred the fact intended upon him, hee was of years and ſtrength ſufficient to have reſiſted his father, he being at leaſt twenty five years of age, and <hi>Abraham</hi> one hundred twenty five. <hi>Now our Saviour</hi> (as the Evangeliſts record) <hi>went forth bearing his croſſe unto a place called in Hebrew Golgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> either a place where the ſculs of dead men were laid, or rather for the forme or faſhion of it like a ſcull: But here ſome curious Inquiſitor, or one diſpoſed to examine or ſcann the relations of the Evangeliſts, as Lawyers doe later evidences by more ancient deeds; would interpoſe this, or the like exception, [<hi>Non concordat cum originali.</hi>] For our Saviour CHRIST (as the Evangeliſts record) was really ſacrificed, actually crucified, and put to death, but ſo was not <hi>Iſaac</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> tels us. But all this will inferr no more, then all good Chriſtians muſt of neceſſity grant, to wit, that the Evangelicall records are more than meer exemplifications of <hi>Moſes.</hi> For that which was verified or truly foreſhadowed in <hi>Abrahams</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe to ſacrifice his onely ſonne; and in his ſons willingneſſe to be ſacrificed by him: was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and exactly fulfilled of God the Father, who
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:7892:180"/>
had bound himſelf by promiſe to give his onely ſonne unto Mankinde, and in the willingneſſe of this his onely ſonne JESUS CHRIST, to be offered up in ſacrifice for the ſinnes of the world. Our Apoſtle is not afraid to ſay, that <hi>Abraham by faith offered up his onely ſonne</hi> (that very man upon whoſe life or death, the fulfilling of the promiſes made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, did depend:) <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting or being reſolved, that God was able to raiſe him up even from the dead, from whence alſo he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him in a figure. Heb.</hi> 11.17, 18. <hi>Iſaac</hi> then was a true figure both of Chriſts death and reſurrection. And <hi>Abraham</hi> firſt in ſtretching forth his hands to ſlay his onely ſonne; and ſecondly in being prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by God from accompliſhing his reſolution: did accurately foreſhadow thoſe fundamentall truths, which wee Chriſtians beleeve concerning the true and bodily death, and reſurrection of our Lord and Saviour. <hi>Abraham</hi> (by benigne Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the minde or reſolution for the very fact or deed) did both ſacrifice his onely ſon, and receive him from the dead.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But was there no more then a tentation or tryall of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith in that ſtory of <hi>Moſes, Gen.</hi> 22? If no more then ſo, the tempting or try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all it ſelf might ſeem ſuperfluous. For God who knoweth all things, aſwell poſſible as determinate or future, did moſt infallibly know what <hi>Abraham</hi> would do upon his command, what hee would leave undone upon expreſſe prohibition. This onely concludeth that the omnipotent and all-ſeeing Father of power did not ſtand in need of
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:7892:181"/>
the determination of <hi>Abrahams</hi> will, either to foreſee or determine that which upon this actuall obedience of <hi>Abraham,</hi> he did firſt binde himſelf by oath to performe: That which long before he had decreed <hi>ad extra,</hi> and in his generall expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his mercy and loving kindneſſe; he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to doe. We had his promiſe before Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde was actually propagated or multiplyed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, <hi>that the womans ſeed ſhould bruiſe the old Serpents head,</hi> which had ſeduced her. The like comfortable words were at ſundry times interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by God himſelf to <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. But upon this preſent fact of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the ſame Lord interpoſeth his oath, (and it was the firſt oath which we reade, that God did make) for the fulfilling of the generall promiſe in one of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt done this thing, and haſt not ſpared thine onely ſonne; by my ſelf have I ſworne, — that in thy ſeed all the Nations of the Earth ſhall be bleſſed.</hi> But did not this God of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and conſolation infallibly know that <hi>Abraham</hi> would be ready to doe all that hee commanded him to doe? Yes certainely and more then ſo, that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould not doe all which he firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to doe. Why then did he command him to ſacrifice his only ſon <hi>Iſaac</hi>? To this end that he might have <hi>Abrahams</hi> full conſent to offer up one of his ſeed, but not <hi>Iſaac</hi>; for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the bleſſing promiſed to mankind from the date of the curſe pronounced againſt the firſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Inaſmuch as <hi>Abraham</hi> was willing to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice his onely ſonne, the ſon of his old age, whom
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:7892:181"/>
he loved more dearely, then he could have done any one or more ſonnes, or then he could have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him if he had been the ſonne of his middle age: his conſent for the ſacrificing of any other either of his or <hi>Iſaacs</hi> poſterity, whoſoever hee were, was evidently included in this his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary obedience. And yet ſo graciouſly and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly did God deale with <hi>Abraham,</hi> that albeit he was the Lord of all, and <hi>Abrahams</hi> moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord in particular; that he would not ſeize upon any of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed for a ſacrifice of atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt himſelf and the whole world, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Abrahams</hi> conſent. This gracious Lord then by interpoſing the forementioned oath, [<hi>that in Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams ſeed all the Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed</hi>] was abundantly mercifull not to <hi>Abraham</hi> onely, but unto all mankinde by him. And yet as <hi>Rupertus</hi> (out of S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> if my memory failes me not) obſerveth, this abundant mercy was not <hi>diluta miſericordia,</hi> that is, this mercy though incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, was well placed, and the accompliſhment of it aſſured upon moſt juſt and equitable, though not upon any valuable conſiderations. <hi>Quaeſivit Deus titulum in Abrahamo,</hi> ſaith this Author, &amp;c. God from the firſt promiſe made to mankinde did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a fit occaſion to confirme it by ſolemn oath, and found out <hi>Abraham</hi> a man (<hi>quoad haec</hi>) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his owne heart for accepting this league or covenant betwixt him and man upon earneſt given or reſolved to be given by <hi>Abraham.</hi> For God had before determined to give his Sonne for the redemption of men, and now finding
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:7892:182"/>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> moſt willing and ready to give him his onely Son, and finding alſo <hi>Abrahams</hi> onely ſon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient unto death: he binds himſelf by ſolemn oath, that he would give his onely Son; &amp; that his onely Sonne being made the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſhould be more willing then <hi>Iſaac</hi> was to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up in bloody ſacrifice for the redemption of Mankinde. But the contents or importances of Gods covenant made by oath unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> were they to be handled alone, would require a larger volume and longer diſquiſition, then I dare in theſe yeares and in this weakneſſe project. So much of them as I conceive to be pertinent unto theſe Commentaries upon the Apoſtles Creed, ſhall be intermingled (by Gods aſſiſtance) in the explication of the articles following.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But taking all that hath beene ſaid for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to wit, that God by demanding <hi>Iſaac</hi> in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or by preſſing <hi>Abraham</hi> to be the Sacrificer, did binde himſelf by oath to offer up his onely ſonne in ſuch a bloody ſacrifice, as <hi>Abraham</hi> had deſtinated <hi>Iſaac</hi> unto: Yet the captious Jews, or other Infidels would thus except, that <hi>Abraham</hi> never intended, nor was he by God commanded to offer up his onely ſonne <hi>Iſaac</hi> upon the croſſe: for that did not onely imply a bloody, but an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed kinde of death. This indeed is the maine ſtumbling block to the Jew, who perhaps would not ſo much as have <hi>ſcunnered</hi> at the Altar, if our Saviour had beene offered upon it, ſpecially in the Temple, or in the Courts adjoyning. The next <hi>quaeries</hi> then, for ſatisfaction of the Jews or other
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:7892:182"/>
Infidels (if God at any time ſhall vouchſafe them eyes to ſee, or eares to heare) are, in what ſacred writings acknowledged by them, the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſacrifice of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, or his ſufferings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a tree or croſſe without the City of Jeruſalem, not in the courts or precincts of the Lords houſe, were either foretold or foreſhadowed.</p>

To this purpoſe he afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds himſelf, when he repeateth his Catechiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me made to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> unto the people, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. <hi>And I, if I be lift up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</hi> He did and doth draw all men unto him, not drag any after him. Such as will not be gently drawn by him, their perdition is from themſelves: and however all ſhall not in the iſſue be ſaved by him, yet he is the Saviour of all, though eſpecially of ſuch as beleeve, that is, of ſuch as out of the ſenſe and feeling of their ſinnes, (which are the ſtings of death,) ſeeke that remedy for their ſouls from meditations upon the croſſe or upon him crucified, which Gods people in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe did for their bodies by looking upon the

brazen Serpent erected by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That bodily ſalvation which they enjoyed by obſerving of this divine preſcript, was not procured by the materiall Serpent on which they looked, but by the vertue of that inviſible pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er whoſe ſpirituall efficacie was in times follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bee more viſibly manifeſted in the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of that grand myſtery, which this ſtrange temporall healing did prefigure: and that was the future cure of our Soules; our delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the tyranny of the old Serpent by the Sonne of God becomming the Sonne of man, and vouchſafing to bee lift up from the earth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſſe. <hi>For it was requiſit that upon them exerciſing tyranny, ſhould come penury, which they could not avoid; but to theſe it ſhould onely be ſhewed how their Enemies were tormented. For when the horrible fierceneſſe of beaſts came upon theſe, and they periſhed with the ſtings of crooked Serpents, thy wrath endured not for ever. But they were troubled for a ſmall ſeaſon, that they might bee admoniſhed, having a ſigne of ſalvation to put them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the commandment of thy Law. For hee that turned himſelf toward it, was not healed by the thing which hee ſaw, but by thee which art the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of all,</hi> Wiſd. 16.4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Shall wee ſay then that the brazen Serpent was a true picture or type of Chriſt? So, many have from the forecited place of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and of theſe many, not a few have ſought out divers properties of braſſe, and of Serpents, more then accurate naturaliſts before had
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:7892:184"/>
knowne, to ſalve up the apparant incongruity betwixt the picture and the body, which they would have it to repreſent. But when they have ſaid all they can, or others more then they could for them, the congruity will bee no better then <hi>ſi gryphes jungantur equis.</hi> For what correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie or conveniency can there bee betweene the Serpent, and the womans ſeed? Shall we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to foreſhadow light by darkneſſe? or make a league betwixt Chriſt, and Beliall? All that which our Saviours expoſition upon <hi>Moſes</hi> his fact will concludently inferre, is briefly this, that the myſtery of his ſuffering upon the Croſſe was prefigured by the erection of the brazen Serpent: and by the comfort which the wounded Iſraelites found by looking upon it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Ahitophels</hi> treachery againſt his Maſter <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did truely foreſhadow the betraying of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> Lord by <hi>Iudas</hi>; yet no man will hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that <hi>Ahitophel</hi> was a type of Chriſt or of his death, but rather of <hi>Iudas</hi> and his fearefull end. Nor was the brazen Serpent any other wayes a type of Chriſts perſon, then <hi>Ahitophel</hi> was, that is no type at all: yet a more excellent type of that old Serpent whom the womans ſeed was to vanquiſh, then <hi>Ahitophel</hi> was of <hi>Iudas.</hi> And the erection of this Serpent upon a pole or tree, was a prophecie or ſpeaking picture that the victory of the womans ſeed or Sonne of God over Satan, ſhould be accompliſht upon the Croſſe. This Interpretation I learne from our Saviour himſelf, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.31. <hi>Now is the judgement of this
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:7892:184"/>
world, now ſhall the prince of this world bee caſt out.</hi> Now, that is, when the Sonne of man ſhall bee lift up. The Croſſe then was the ſcene or ſtage, wherein the long duell was to bee determined; and the deſtruction of the old fiery Serpent upon the ſtage was excellently foreſhadowed by the lifting up of the brazen Serpent in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which queſtionleſſe did better repreſent a dead, wounded, or bruiſed Serpent, then a live or active one. This interpretation or diſplay of that ſacred Embleme, is moſt conſonant to the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall circumſtances and occaſions, which <hi>Moſes</hi> had to make, and ſet up the brazen Serpent upon a pole to the view of all the people. God from the fall of our firſt Parents did by way of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well upon the woman and her ſeed, as upon the Serpent and his ſeed, which had ſeduced her, denounce a perpetuall enmity betweene them. Now albeit this enmity did principally conſiſt between the womans ſeed <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is our Saviour, and the old Serpent, that is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and their followers: Yet this ſpirituall enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was viſibly repreſented to the world by that antipathy which in courſe of nature is uſually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced betweene men and bodily Serpents. And this enmity (ſpecially on the Serpents part) was never more remarkable then in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe when the murmuring Iſraelites did tempt the Lord their God after the ſame manner, as the firſt woman had done, that is by luſting after meats for that time and place forbidden; by loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Manna and heavenly food which God had
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:7892:185"/>
plentifully provided for them. <hi>And they departed from the mount Hor by the way of the red Sea, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the land of Edom: and the people were ſore greeved, becauſe of the way. And the people ſpake againſt God, and againſt Moſes, ſaying, Wherefore have yee brought us out of Aegypt to die in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? for here is neither bread nor water, and our ſoule loatheth this light bread. Wherefore the Lord ſent fiery Serpents among the people which ſtang the people, ſo that many of the children of Iſrael died. Therefore the people came to Moſes and ſaid, Wee have ſinned for wee have ſpoken againſt the Lord, and againſt thee: pray unto the Lord, that hee take away the Serpents from us. And Moſes prayed for the people. And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, Make thee a fiery Serpent, and ſet it upon a pole: and it ſhall come to paſſe, that every one that is bitten when hee looketh upon it, ſhall live. And Moſes made a Serpent of braſſe and put it upon a pole, and it came to paſſe, if a Serpent had bitten any man, when hee beheld the Serpent of braſſe, hee lived,</hi> Num. 21.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The importance or implication of the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie, is, that as God had now brought that curſe upon them, which had been denounced againſt the womans ſeed from her firſt ſinne: ſo in caſe they would not tempt the Lord their God by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing their firſt Parents ſinne, they ſhould in good time ſee the curſe denounced againſt the old Serpent, that is the cruſhing of his head, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly fulfilled as the puniſhment upon the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſeed had beene by the fiery Serpents in bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:7892:185"/>
their heeles: That the ſame Lord who had now ſaved them from the poiſon of theſe leſſer bodily Serpents, would in his good time deprive the old Serpent of his deadly ſting, and deſtroy death it ſelf by dying upon the Croſſe. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of woes or calamities threatned againſt diſobedience, is uſually given by Gods <note n="*" place="margin">Ier. 32.42.</note> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets as a pledge or earneſt for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the good things, which he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the penitent.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That which ſpecially did firſt perſwade me thus to diſplay the Embleme of the brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, was the demolition of it by good <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who queſtionleſſe would never have done to it as he did, had hee knowen or taken it to have been the type or figure of his expected Redeemer, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then of his Enemy. The good King by this zealous fact did foreſhadow the future accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of that grand myſtery, which the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the brazen Serpent was appointed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, to wit, the diſſolution of the old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents Kingdome over this world. The adoration of this Serpent, whilſt it ſtood uncruſht, was not onely an abuſe of things indifferent, but the moſt prepoſterous idolatry which this rebellious ſtiffenecked people did at any time practice. For in worſhipping it, they did worſhip him, whoſe quality and perſon it did repreſent. And for this reaſon <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was moved with greater indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt it, then againſt any other idoll, ſtatue, or reliques of idolatry which came in his way. <hi>Hee took away the high places, and brake the
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:7892:186"/>
images, and cut downe the groves, and brake in pieces the brazen Serpent, that Moſes had made: for unto thoſe dayes the children of Iſrael did burne incenſe unto it, and he called it Nehuſhtan,</hi> 2. Kings 18.4, 5. A name queſtionleſſe implying much more, then the meere grammaticall expreſſion (which moſt Interpreters uſe) imports. Nor had this good Kings words or fact beene worth the regiſtring, if hee had onely called a brazen Serpent broken to pieces a piece of braſſe. But the full impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of this word, as of many others in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, whether in the Greek or Hebrew, will not be eaſily found in ordinary Lexicons or Nomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clators. Every good Interpreter ſhould have a Lexicon either of his owne, or others gathering peculiar unto Divinity, ſpecially for words uſed in a technicall, Emblematicall, or proverbiall ſenſe. However <hi>Nechoſheth</hi> ſignifies no more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily then braſſe: Yet <hi>Nehuſhtan</hi> in this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blematicall ſpeech, or fact of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> (as I ſhould gheſſe) imports no leſſe, then our Engliſh <hi>foule feend, the old Dragon</hi> or <hi>Satanas.</hi> As theſe Idolaters in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time did adore the picture or type of the old Serpent: ſo this laſt generation having forſaken the God of their Fathers, did chuſe <hi>Barabbas</hi> the ſonne of the Serpent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the Sonne of God for being their Lord, and ſo make up the full meaſure of their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers iniquity, and brought a greater plague upon their poſterity, then any which did befall their Anceſtors in the wilderneſſe, whether by the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Serpents, or other of Gods judgements or puniſhments.</p>

                     <pb n="363" facs="tcp:7892:186"/>7. To this effect I took occaſion to expound this fact of <hi>Hezekiah obiter</hi> and upon another text in a learned audience many years now agoe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the tax of any (as farre as I could heare) and with better approbation of ſome then preſent, then I expected, becauſe the expoſition was new and uncouth.

                  <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ut before Gods people could be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of this cure of their ſoules by looking upon him who did vanquiſh the old Serpent, or before he came to be the Author of ſo great ſalvation: he was to make full ſatisfaction for their ſins, whoſe waight had otherwayes preſſed all Mankinde down to hell. This full reconciliation or atonement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the juſt unpartial Judge and ſinfull men, was made upon the croſſe. But ſome will demand in what part of <hi>Moſes</hi> writings this was foretold or prefigured? It was moſt exquiſitely foretold and prefigured, partly in the alienation of the primacy
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:7892:187"/>
from the moneth <hi>Tiſri</hi> unto the moneth <hi>Abib.</hi> Untill the law was given, <hi>Tiſri</hi> had abſolute pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency, being the moneth wherein according to all probability the world was created. But upon the deliverance of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed from the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Egypt, the moneth <hi>Abib</hi> by Gods ſpeciall command had both precedency and preeminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: Yet not abſolute precedency, but precedency in reſpect of that which was more preeminent, to wit, for the Spirituall or Eccleſiaſticall account; as for their accounts temporall, <hi>September</hi> or <hi>Tiſri</hi> did ſtill retaine precedency. And for this reaſon I take it our Saviour was firſt proclaimed the Meſſias by <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> in the moneth <hi>Tiſri,</hi> but afterwards declared to be the Sonne of God by his reſurrection from the dead in the moneth <hi>Abib.</hi> At his Baptiſme he had fulfilled one part of the myſtery prefigured in the legall feaſt of atonement, which was celebrated upon the tenth day of the moneth <hi>Tiſri.</hi> In his ſufferings upon Mount Calvary he did fully accompliſh that which was prefigured by the legall ſacrifices in the day of Atonement, and that which was inchoated by himſelfe at the day of his Baptiſme. At his <note n="*" place="margin">See Chriſts anſwer to <hi>John.</hi>
                     </note> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme he fulfilled the myſtery of the ſcape goate bearing theſe peoples ſinnes into the wilderneſſe, and there vanquiſhed the great Tempter who had firſt vanquiſhed them and their forefathers. At the feaſt of the Paſſeover in the moneth <hi>Abib</hi> he accompliſhed the myſtery prefigured by the other goat, whoſe blood was brought by the high Prieſt into the Sanctuary. Thus much we learne
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:7892:188"/>
from our Apoſtle, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.10. <hi>&amp;c. Wee have an Altar, whereof they have no right to eate, which ſerve the Tabernacle. For the bodies of thoſe beaſts, whoſe blood is brought into the Sanctuary by the high Prieſt for ſinne, are burnt without the camp. Wherefore Ieſus 2alſo, that he might ſanctifie the people with his owne blood, ſuffered without the gate. Let us goe forth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.</hi> The true meaning or purport of this paſſage, and the connexion of it with the former, the Reader ſhall finde more at large in a Sermon to be annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (by Gods aſſiſtance) with others to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and the former Treatiſe. All in this place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by me, is to ſatisfie ſuch as will be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that our Saviours ſufferings upon the croſſe were a moſt true and proper ſacrifice: a ſacrifice fully ſatisfactory for the ſinnes of the world: the accompliſhment of all the ſacrifices of the law: the onely ſacrifice whereof the anniverſary ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices uſed in the feaſt of atonement, were but ſhadows, no true images. Againe, that the anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary ſacrifices of the Paſſeover which were in the moneth <hi>Abib,</hi> and thoſe in the feaſt of Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were to be joyntly accompliſhed at one and the ſame time, to wit, in the firſt moneth after this peoples delivery out of Egypt; is implyed in the alteration of the account upon their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. For that alteration portendeth that in the very ſame moneth, in which they were delivered, there ſhould be in after times a more generall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of Gods people, whoſe memory ſhould deſerve the precedency of all feaſts and ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:7892:188"/>
Such was that feaſt of the Paſſeover, wherein our Saviour ſuffered.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for all the circumſtances of place, or time, or the like wherein other legall ſacrifices were offered; the myſteries prefigured by them could not poſſibly be accompliſhed in one and the ſame time, and place by any ſacrifice; not by the ſacrifice of the Sonne of God himſelf, though all-ſufficient for its ſubſtance. For if he ſhould have fulfilled the ſacrifice of Atonement in the feaſt of Atonement, and the ſacrifice of the Paſchal lamb in the month <hi>Abib,</hi> or in the place where it was offered; he muſt have dyed oftner then once, and in more places then one. For the myſtery prefigured by the Paſchal lamb, that was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in due time on the day appointed for that ſacrifice. So was the Altar whereon he was offered, that is, the croſſe, the accompliſhment of the figurative place whereon the firſt Paſchal lamb was offered, and that was the lintels or doore poſts of the Iſraelites houſes, on which the blood of the Paſchal lamb was ſprinckled. But the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Paſchal lamb in the firſt inſtitution, was <hi>intra pomaeria,</hi> within the doores or precincts of private families, or within the compaſſe of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick places of meetings. So that in reſpect of the place wherein the true Paſchal lamb, and the true lamb of God was ſlaine or ſacrificed, there is ſome diſparity; yet a full harmony betweene the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of both ſacrifices, and the circumſtances of time wherein they were offered. But this defect, or rather this variation concerning the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:7892:189"/>
of place, wherein the Paſchal Lamb and the Lamb of God, who taketh away the ſinnes of the world were offered, is moſt exactly recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the circumſtance of place wherein the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the hee goat, on which the Lords lot ſhould fall, and other ſacrifices in the day of Atonement were by a moſt peremptory law to be conſumed. And that place was without the camp, whilſt the poſterity of <hi>Iacob</hi> had no Temple or no fixt place of worſhipping God, but a mooveable Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. <hi>Alſo the bullock for the burnt offering, and the goat for the ſinne offering (whoſe blood was brought to make a reconciliation in the holy place) ſhall one carry out without the hoaſt to be burnt in the fire with their skins and with their fleſh, and with their dung,</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Vide Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traeism in hoc caput.</note> 
                     <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.27. This is the Apoſtles meaning in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited place <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. <hi>Ieſus, alſo, that he might ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the people with his owne blood, ſuffered without the gate,</hi> that is, without the city, yet neare the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs of Jeruſalem, whoſe type or figure was the camp of the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe, or at that time wherein the Tabernacle was moveable. For the Tabernacle was but a model or paterne of the Temple in Jeruſalem, as the camp of the Iſraëlites in the wilderneſſe was of Jeruſalem it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And however their GOD, and ſupreme Lawgiver did by a peremptory law enjoyne his people, that no manner of bloody ſacrifice ſhould be offered, or at leaſt no publick ſolemne feaſt be celebrated ſave only in Jeruſalem, after the Ark was brought into it and placed in the Temple:

Yet the circumſtance of the place, wherein our Saviour was ſacrificed, was exactly foreſhadowed by the place wherein the anniverſary ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the feaſt of Atonement during the time of this peoples progreſſe in the wilderneſſe or move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Tabernacle, were offered, and that was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the camp, or trenches of that great Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXXIII. At what houre of the day our Saviour was crucified, at what houre taken down from the croſſe, and of the myſteries enſuing his death.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout the time of the yeare, as in what moneth, and in what day of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, the Lamb of God was offered or did offer up himſelf in bloody ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, there is no queſtion of moment, or none at leaſt which may not eaſily be reſolved. But as concerning the time of the day, or hour wherein hee was offered, there is more then variety of opinions amongſt the learned: ſome apparance of contradiction betweene two, over whom were they now alive, no authority now on earth could have any power either of arbitration or juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>It was the third houre</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Mark,) and they crucified him, &amp;c.</hi> 15.25. deſigning the time after he was brought to Golgotha, <hi>and refuſed to taſte of the wine mingled with myrrhe</hi>; Whereas S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaking of the time a little before <hi>Pilat</hi> gave ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, ſaith, <hi>It was the preparation of the Sabbath, and about the ſixth houre. Iohn</hi> 19.14. That the various relations of theſe two Evangeliſts (if we take them as they are extant in moſt copies) ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, there is a neceſſity. And if either of their owne writings were to be corrected by the other; S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Goſpel (as <hi>Maldonat</hi> well obſerveth) were to be corrected by S. <hi>Marks.</hi> For S. <hi>Marks</hi> aſſertion is punctuall and preciſe, and betweene
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:7892:190"/>
the ancient Manuſcripts and moderne exemplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of his Goſpel, there is no variation: but in S. <hi>Iohns</hi> there are. For in ſome copies yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and in ſome which <hi>Nonnus</hi> in his Poeticall paraphraſt did follow, there is expreſſe mention of the third houre, not of the ſixth. Whence it is probably conjectured by ſome, that the ſixth houre was inſerted by the Tranſcribers of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Goſpel for the third, upon a miſtake of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures or numericall characters; the numericall character of the ſixth houre being not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the numericall character of the third houre. And yet it cannot be denied that in ſome ancient Manuſcripts of the Greek Teſtament now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, the numbers of houres or dayes or yeares are expreſt in entire words, not in figures or nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericall characters. But whether this manner of expreſſing numbers was uſuall <hi>ab initio,</hi> or in the times when S. <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote, or uſed at all by him, is not ſo cleare. For ſeverall ages or revolutions of times have their ſeverall manners of expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſpecially for quoting of Scriptures or deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phering of numbers. And ſometimes later ages agree better in this point with the moſt ancient, then middle ages doe. The determination of this particular, as whether in S. <hi>Iohns</hi> time, numbers were expreſt at large, or in figures, I referre to profeſſed Antiquaries.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But admitting that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> did write ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, about the ſixth houre (not in figures:) Many learned men of ſeverall Churches and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, have wittily attempted to ſalve the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:7892:191"/>
of contradiction betwixt him and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> by reducing the manner of meaſuring the day unto the ſcale or manner of meaſuring the night, which they divide into foure parts or wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, every watch containing three houres ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Sun-diall; So as the firſt great houre anſwerable to the watch by night, did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at ſix in the morning, and continue till nine which with them was called the third houre; and this third houre anſwerable to the ſecond watch of the night containing likewiſe three diurnall houres, did continue untill the mid-day, or twelve of the clock, at which time their ſixth houre did commence, and continue til their ninth houre, which is our three a clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, at which time it is without queſtion that our Saviour did yeeld up the Ghoſt. So that when S. <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith, <hi>our Saviour was crucified at the third houre,</hi> that is, about nine a clock in the forenoone, and before twelve, which was the ſixth houre; and when S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith hee was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to death by <hi>Pilat</hi> about the ſixth houre: wee muſt take his meaning to bee thus, that hee was ſo ſentenced, as long before the ſixth houre, which is our twelve a clock, as after the third houre, which is our nine. So that the preciſe time of his crucifying ſhould bee about half an houre after ten of the clock. For if wee admit or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the former ſcale of dividing the day into the firſt, third, ſixth, and ninth houre, it might as truely bee ſaid, our Saviour was crucified about the ſixth houre, as about the third houre, if hee
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:7892:191"/>
were crucified at half an houre after ten. For ſo ſome Collegiat ſtatutes which enjoine the ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their gates at eight in Winter, and nine in Summer, and opening them about ſix in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and five in Summer; have beene by legall and authorized conſtruction adjudged to bee rightly obſerved, ſo they were ſhut within half an houre after eight in Winter, or half an houre after nine in Summer: or opened half an houre after ſix in Winter, and half an houre after five in Summer. So that ſuch as approve the former reconciliation of S. <hi>Mark</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> did very cautelouſly pitch upon the point of time menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, that is, half an houre after ten in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for the crucifying of our Saviour, or for the point of time wherein <hi>Pilat</hi> did ſentence him to death. For this was the juſt middle point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the third houre, and the ſixth houre, and did equally referre to both. This reconciliation of the two Evangeliſts, would have better ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied me, if the Authors or followers of it had not attempted to have given a reaſon for it, which I can no way approve, but rather ſuſpect the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion it ſelf for the improbabilitie of the reaſon alledged by them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The reaſon which <hi>Maldonat</hi> (a man free enough to admit miſnomers or miſtakes in Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers of the Goſpel) alledgeth for his opinion [that our Saviour was not crucified preciſely at the third houre] (as S. <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith;) is becauſe in his judgement ſo many buſineſſes or debate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as did interpoſe in that morning, wherein
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:7892:192"/>
our Saviour was ſentenced unto the death of the Croſſe, could not be diſpatched before the third houre, that is nine a clock in the forenoone. But in my opinion (which I ſubmit to better judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) more buſineſſes by many then the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts relate, might have beene determined accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the courſe of civill Juſtice (eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch as examine them <hi>ſummariè &amp; de plano</hi>) within leſſe time then S. <hi>Mark</hi> and the other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts allot to the examination, arraignment, and adjudication of our Saviour to the death of the Croſſe. <hi>Vt primum exortus eſt dies, Aſſoone as it was day</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Luke) the Elders of the people, and the chief Prieſts and Scribes came together, and led him to their Councel, &amp;c.</hi> Luk. 22.66. The time then of their Aſſembly to examine him (albeit wee account the beginning of the day onely from the Sunne-riſing not from the dawning) was at ſix a clock in the morning, (if not before.) <hi>And after they had examined him, the whole multitude of them aroſe, and led him unto Pilat and begun to accuſe him,</hi> Luk. 23.3. And this in all probability was before their ſecond houre, or ſeven a clock with us in the morning. Now the time of our Saviours circuiting from <hi>Pilat</hi> to <hi>Herod,</hi> and back againe, and all the debatements betwixt <hi>Pilat</hi> and the Jews, which are related by the Evangeliſts, could not in that tumultuous Congregation take up more time then an houre and an half. So that our Saviour might not onely bee ſentenced to death by <hi>Pilat</hi> (as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> relates) but actually crucified, or lifted up upon the Croſſe preciſely
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:7892:192"/>
and punctually at the third houre, as S. <hi>Marks</hi> words import.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If we thus reconcile S <hi>Iohn,</hi> (or rather the Tranſcribers of his Goſpel) unto S. <hi>Mark,</hi> and his Goſpel, as in all copies now it is extant; the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony between the type and the antitype, or the proportion between the picture and the live ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance repreſented by it, will be moſt exact. For, we are to conſider that the Sonne of God by the ſacrifice of himſelf once for all, was to accompliſh not onely the anniverſary ſacrifices of atonement of the Paſſeover, &amp;c. but the continuall daily mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and evening ſacrifices. The houre allotted for the morning ſacrifice was the third houre, or nine a clock in the forenoone; the houre appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and accuſtomed for the evening ſacrifice, was the ninth houre, or three a clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone: and at this houre (as the Evangeliſts joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly record) our Lord Redeemer did accompliſh his ſacrifice. <hi>Ieſus</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Matthew) when he had cryed againe with a loud voice</hi> (and that was about the ninth houre) <hi>gave up the ghoſt. Et ecce aulaeum Templi fiſſum eſt, and behold the vaile of the Temple was rent in twaine from the top to the bottome.</hi> 27.46, 50, 51. One ſpeciall importance of the word <hi>Ecce</hi> in this place as in many others, is the preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of that which was promiſed or porten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The myſtery foreſhadowed or portended by the anniverſary ſacrifices of the Paſchal Lamb, by the daily morning and evening ſacrifices, by thoſe ſacrifices of the Atonement whoſe blood was brought by the high Prieſt unto the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary;
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:7892:193"/>
was in brief this, that all theſe rites or ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities ſhould expire upon the death or ſacrifice of the true Lamb of God: and thus much, and more is ſealed unto us by that ſpeech of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our a little before his death, <hi>Conſummatum eſt, All is finiſhed, Iohn</hi> 19.30. Now the rending of the vaile immediately after our Saviour had commended his Spirit into his Fathers hands, did betoken <hi>that now,</hi> and not before, the entrance or paſſage into that moſt holy place, which was prefigured by the materiall <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> was ſet open not to Prieſts onely, but to all true beleevers: That the coeleſtiall Sanctuary (whether that be <hi>coelum empyr aeum</hi> the ſeat of our future bliſſe, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place) was now inſtantly to be hallowed, or conſecrated by the blood of the high Prieſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as the terrene Tabernacle or Sanctuary was by the legal high Prieſt with the blood of bullocks or goats, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Whitherſoever the ſoule of this our high Prieſt went that day, wherein he offered the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of himſelf, (as whether into the nethermoſt hell, or into the place where the ſoules of the righteous men did reſt,) there is or ſhould be no queſtion among good Chriſtians but that he was that evening in Paradiſe. For, ſo had he promiſed unto the penitent Malefactor who was crucified with him, with an aſſeveration equivalent to an oath, <hi>Amen dico tibi, hodie mecum eris in paradiſo, Verily I ſay unto thee, this day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> As for thoſe ſophiſticall Noveliſts (to ſay no worſe) who thus miſpoint the words
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:7892:193"/>
of his promiſe, <hi>Amen dico tibi hodie, mecum eris in Paradiſo,</hi> Verily I ſay unto thee this day, thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe, to wit, ſometimes hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as at the generall reſurrection of the juſt (though not this very day,) they declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be in this particular as in moſt others, more unfit to interpret ſacred Oracles, then Apes to be principall Actors in ſtately dolefull Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. For our Lord and Saviour did moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly grant this poore ſoule more then he durſt petition for; and with better expedition, then he could hope for, to wit, a preſent eſtate of bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whereas he requeſted onely to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with ſome mercy or favour without inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any point of time (after our Saviour had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into his Kingdome.) And his entrance into that Kingdome was not upon the ſame day wherein he ſuffered, nor within forty dayes after. The Kingdom of heaven was not ſet open to any beleevers, not to <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf upon our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours paſſion or reſurrection, whether that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome import the ſame place wherein <hi>Abraham</hi> before that time was or ſome other. For it is one thing to ſay that the ſoules of righteous men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed were in heaven before our Saviour aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thither: another to ſay they were in the Kingdome of heaven, or Citizens of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which upon the day of our Saviours vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over death was not erected. And he who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth the ſouls of the Patriarchs to be partakers of the Kingdome of heaven before our Saviours death, cannot be concluded to grant that they
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:7892:194"/>
were either in <hi>Limbo</hi> or in any other region un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the earth, or under the ſtars.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But to waive further diſpute about this point for the preſent: Our Saviours ſoule upon the ſame day wherein he dyed, was in paradiſe: and ſo was the ſoule of the penitent Malefactor, yet not at the ſame inſtant (perhaps not within the compaſſe of the ſame houre wherein our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours ſoule went thither) in what region ſoever whether of heaven or earth this paradiſe was ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For it is evident out of the Evangelicall hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that our Saviour did ſurrender his ſoule into his fathers hand before either of them who were crucified with him, did expire. For as was before recited out of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> 27.50. immediatly upon the ninth houre our Saviour yeelded up the Ghoſt. This teſtimony alone, or this at leaſt with the like, <hi>Mark</hi> 15.37. had been ſufficient to prove the Article of our Saviours death. But for the more full ſatisfaction of all poſterity as well of Jews as of Gentiles, God would have the death of his onely Sonne to be remarkably recorded, by the ſolemn teſtimony of the Roman Centurion taken upon examination before <hi>Pilat: And now when the even was come</hi> (that, I take it, was betwixt five and ſix of the clock:) <hi>becauſe it was the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that is, the day before the Sabbath</hi>; Joſeph <hi>of</hi> Arimathea <hi>an honourable Counſailer, who alſo waited for the Kingdome of God, came and went in boldly to</hi> Pilat, <hi>and craved the body of</hi> JESUS. <hi>And</hi> Pilat <hi>marvailed if he were already dead, and calling unto him the Centurion, he asked him, whether he had been
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:7892:194"/>
any while dead. And when he knew it of the Centurion, he gave the body to</hi> Joſeph. <hi>Mark</hi> 15.42, 43, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That our Saviour died before the other which were crucified with him, is more apparant from the parallel teſtimony of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> 19.31, 32, &amp;c. <hi>The Iews therefore, becauſe it was the preparation, that the bodies ſhould not remain upon the croſſe on the Sabbath day, (for that Sabbath day was an high day:) beſought</hi> Pilat <hi>that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. Then came the Souldiers and brake the legs of the firſt, and of the other which was crucifyed with him. But when they came to</hi> JESUS <hi>and ſaw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. And thus we may obſerve that aſwell the malignant Jews, as Chriſts Diſciples of the Jewiſh Nation, and the Roman Souldiers, though unwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly did ſtrangely combine for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of divers prophecies or prefigurations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the death of the Sonne of God. Had hee not died before the other two which were cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with him, his legs had been broken with theirs, and his body had not been interr'd before the ſetting of the Sunne, as is probable from <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats</hi> demand to the Centurion [<hi>whether he had been any while dead</hi>] before he would give <hi>Ioſeph</hi> leave to bury his body. Now if his body had not been interr'd before the Sun-ſet, or at leaſt before the ſtarrs appeared, the myſtery prefigured by the impriſonment of <hi>Ionas</hi> three dayes and three nights in the belly of the whale could not by any Synecdoche have been exactly fulfilled by his
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:7892:195"/>
bleſſed reſt in the grave: but of this hereafter, Again, if the breaking of his legs had not been prevented by his dying before the other two which were crucifyed with him; the harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the manner of his death, and the death of the Paſchal Lamb could not have been ſo exact: <hi>for no bone of it was to be broken, Exodus</hi> 12.46. <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.12, Nor ſhould that which <hi>David</hi> ſpake of himſelf, (but of himſelf as he was the type of Chriſt) when he was in ſome perill of breaking his leggs or armes, or ſome better joynts, have found its accompliſhment in the circumſtance of our Saviours death. <hi>Theſe things were done</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Iohn) that the Scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him ſhall not be broken. Iohn</hi> 19.36. This allegation of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> (if my obſervation faile not) referrs as literally and properly to that ſaying of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 34.20. (when he was driven by <hi>Saul</hi> into the cave of <hi>Adullam</hi>) as unto the rite of the Paſchal Lamb before cited, <hi>He keepeth all his bones, not one of them is broken.</hi> This was not a meere hiſtoricall narration, but a ſpeech typically propheticall, that is, firſt verifyed of <hi>David,</hi> and afterwards to be more exactly accompliſhed in the Son of <hi>David.</hi> Of the ſame rank was that which followeth, <hi>Evill ſhall ſtay the wicked, and they that hate the righteous ſhall be deſolate. The Lord redeemeth the ſoule of his Servants, and none of them that truſt in him, ſhall be deſolate. verſe</hi> 21, 22. The truth of this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was never ſo punctually proved, or exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifyed as in the death of the two Malefactors which were crucifyed with our Saviour. Though
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:7892:195"/>
neither of them had any intereſt in the former promiſe [<hi>He keepeth all his bones, not one of them is broken;</hi>] yet the ſoule of the one who truſted in the Lord, was inſtantly redeemed, and taken up into Paradiſe by him: the ſoule of the other which did hate and revile him, was (to ſay no worſe) left deſolate.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Again, the law concerning the taking down of ſuch as were hanged on a tree (though not ſtrangled,) before the night went over them; had not been accompliſhed in our Saviour, unleſſe the day wherein he dyed had been the preparation to the great Sabbath. For it was not the zeale of the Jews unto the due obſervation of this law, but feare of polluting this great Sabbath which mooved them to become petitioners unto <hi>Pilat,</hi> that the bodies of all that were then crucifyed might be taken downe, and carryed away before the beginning of the Sabbath, which was in the twilight following. The law which out of this feare they occaſioned to be obſerved and fulfilled, is extant, <hi>Deuteron.</hi> 21.22, 23. <hi>And if a man have committed a ſinne worthy of death, and be be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree: his body ſhall not remaine upon the tree, but thou ſhalt in any wiſe bury him that day: for he that is hanged is accurſed of God: that thy land be not defiled, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.</hi> That this law had a ſpeciall reference or pre-aſpect unto our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours death upon the croſſe, S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught us, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us: for it is
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:7892:196"/>
written, Curſed is every one that hangeth on a tree.</hi> Laſtly, however the Centurion and the Souldiers apprehended no neceſſity of breaking our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours legs, as being perſwaded that he had been a good while dead, and fit to be buryed: Yet one of them to make all (as we ſay) ſure, pierced his ſide while he was yet hanging upon the croſſe, with a ſpeare, ſtriking him (as by the poſture of his body is probable) under the ſhort ribbs through his very heart: otherwiſe he might have broken one, or more of his bones. And this, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> inſtructs us, was done <hi>that another Scripture might be fulfilled, And they ſhall look on him whom they have pierced, Iohn</hi> 19.37. The prophecy which by this accident was exactly fulfilled, we have <hi>Zachar.</hi> 12.8, 9, <hi>&amp;c. In that day ſhall the Lord defend the Inhabitants of Ieruſalem, and he that is feeble among them at that day ſhall be as</hi> David; <hi>and the houſe of</hi> David <hi>ſhall be as God, as the Angell of the Lord before them. And it ſhall come to paſſe in that day, that I will ſeek to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all the Nations that come againſt Ieruſalem. And I will poure upon the houſe of</hi> David, <hi>and upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Ieruſalem, the Spirit of Grace and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; and they ſhall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn for him as one mourneth for his onely ſonne, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. This ſacred paſſage lieth punctually under that line or rule for interpreting ſacred oracles, which in theſe commentaries hath been oft here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore mentioned: that is, it is a paſſage which cannot be literally verifyed of any perſon beſides God himſelf, nor could it have been fulfilled in
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:7892:196"/>
God himſelf otherwiſe, then as he was incarnate, made ſubject to death, and violent percuſſion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death. But whether this paſſage either accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the literall ſenſe of the Prophet, or to the intention of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in avouching the fulfilling of it, amount to any more then hath been ſaid, or (in particular) to inferre [that <hi>reall communication</hi> of properties between the divine and humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt,] which ſome of the moſt learned in the Lutheran Church would from this place (in ſpeciall) preſſe upon us; is a diſquiſition more proper to the Article of the holy Catholique Church, then to this Treatiſe of the Humiliation of the Sonne of God. That humiliation (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) did expire with his death; or at leaſt when he was taken downe from the croſſe after his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſides had been ſo pierced, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> relates by that rude Roman Souldier, whoſe name by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written tradition was <hi>Longius,</hi> but a name (as I ſuppoſe) miſtaken for the weapon wherewith he pierced him, which was <gap reason="foreign">

               <head>The Concluſion of this Treatiſe.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T followeth in the Apoſtles Creed that he <hi>was buried,</hi> that <hi>he deſcended into hell.</hi> In what ſenſe ſoever we take this word <hi>buried,</hi> the hiſtoricall truth of it is moſt punctually recorded by the Evangeliſts. The one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>quaere</hi> which this article, or this part of the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle will admit, is, whether by his buriall we are to underſtand the interring or depoſiture of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the monument: or rather his imbalming by <hi>Ioſeph</hi> or <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> who did accompliſh that work which the good woman before his death did foreſignify, or begin by pouring out that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ointment on his head. This <hi>quaere</hi> hath been long agoe propoſed by ſome learned men in the <note n="*" place="margin">Vide Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum Ramu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tariis de ſide Capite 130. de Chriſti ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulturâ. Et Tremellium in editione Syriaci Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamenti.</note> French and German Churches, who ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the locall deſcenſion of his ſoule into hell, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the place of the damned, or into <hi>Limbum patrum.</hi> But this truth they have denyed or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned with better moderation and diſcretion, then ſuch of our Native Engliſh as either have queſtioned or oppoſed our Churches meaning in this Article. For by his deſcending into hell, theſe men would have us underſtand the interring or depoſiture of his body in the monument or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre wherein no man had been laid before, being before imbalmed, <hi>as the manner of the Iews was to bury, Iohn</hi> 19 40. But for pleading one way or other of Chriſt his deſcenſion into hell, at this time, or in this place, I have excluded my ſelf in
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:7892:197"/>
the <note place="margin">See the 2. page of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</note> generall diviſion of this and the enſuing Treatiſe, which was concerning the humiliation and exaltation of the Sonne of God. Now unto whether member of this dichotomie or generall diviſion, the buriall, interring, or deſcenſion of the Sonne of God into hell, ſhould be referr'd; I am not as yet reſolved by any Catholick conſent: But in my private opinion, I think rather to the <hi>Exaltation or Conſecration of the Sonne of God</hi> to his everlaſting Prieſthood.
<q>And unto this Treatiſe principally intended by mee in theſe long Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries upon the Apoſtles Creed, I muſt crave pardon to referr all thoſe other moderne Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies concerning the extent of our Saviours ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, <hi>for whom he dyed; for whom he roſe again; whether the redemption purchaſed by his blood, was univerſall to all mankinde, or to the elect or predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated onely; or</hi> (ſeeing redemption is a terme importing matter diviſible,) what part of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption purchaſed by Chriſt, was common <hi>to Adam, and all that came after him</hi>; what part more proper to ſuch as under the law were circumciſed, or in the time of the Goſpell bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; what part of the ſame redemption, is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the Elect or predeſtinate.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the meane time I conclude this Treatiſe concerning the humiliation of the Sonne of God, with that excellent prayer for the peace of the Church, firſt conceived in Latine by <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> and afterwards ſet forth A<hi rend="sup">o</hi> D<hi rend="sup">ni</hi> M. D. XLV. both in Latine and Engliſh, as a part or appendix of
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:7892:198"/>
that Primmer or Liturgie which K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. cauſed to be publiſhed by the Supreme Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church of England, with divers other godly prayers yet retained, as appertinences if not as genuine parts of our Communion book. Why this prayer for the peace of the Church ſhould be left out, I ſuppoſe the moderat and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Reader will wonder with me.</p>

Once when thou ſleptſt in the ſhip, and a tempeſt ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ariſing threatned death to all in the ſhip, thou awokeſt at the outcry of a few diſciples, and ſtraightway at thine Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty word the waters cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, the winds fell, the ſtorme was ſuddenly turned into a great calme: the dumbe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters know their makers voice. Now in this farre greater tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:7892:200"/>
wherein not a few mens bodies be in danger, but innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable ſoules: wee beſeech thee at the cry of thy holy Church, which is in danger of drowning, that thou wilt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake. So many thouſands of men doe crie, Lord ſave us, we periſh, the tempeſt is paſt mans power: yea we ſee that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of them that would help it, doe turne cleane a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way. It is thy word that muſt doe the deed, Lord Jeſu. Onely ſay thou with a word of thy mouth, Ceaſe ô tempeſt, and forthwith ſhall the deſired calme appeare. Thou wouldeſt have ſpared ſo many thouſands of moſt wicked men, if in the City of Sodom had been found but ten good men. Now here be ſo many thouſands of men, which love the glory of thy Name, which ſigh for the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thy houſe; and wilt thou not at theſe mens prayers let goe thine anger and remember thine accuſtomed and old mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies? Shalt thou not with thy heavenly policy turne our fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into thy glory? Shalt thou
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:7892:200"/>
not turne the wicked mens e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills into thy Churches good? For thy mercy is wont then moſt of all to ſuccour, when the thing is with us paſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and neither the might nor wiſedome of men can help it. Thou alone bringeſt things that bee never ſo out of order, into order againe: which art the onely Author and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of peace. Thou framedſt that old confuſion, which wee call <hi>Chaos,</hi> wherein without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, without faſhion confuſely lay the diſcordant ſeeds of things, and with a wonderfull order the things that of nature fought together, thou diddeſt ally and knit in a perpetuall band. But how much greater confuſion is this, where is no charity, no fidelity, no bonds of love, no reverence neither of lawes, nor yet of rulers; no agreement of opinions, but as it were in a miſordered quire, every man ſingeth a contrary note. Among the heavenly Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets is no diſſention, all foure Elements keep their place, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one doe their office where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:7892:201"/>
they bee appointed. And wilt thou ſuffer thy Spouſe, for whoſe ſake all things were made, thus by continuall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords to periſh &amp; go to wrack? Shalt thou ſuffer the wicked ſpirits, which bee authors and workers of diſcord, to beare ſuch a ſwinge in thy Kingdome unchecked? Shalt thou ſuffer the ſtrong Captaine of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, whom thou once over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threweſt, againe to invade thy tents and to ſpoile thy ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? When thou wert here a man converſant amongſt men, at thy voice fled the devills. Send forth we beſeech thee, O Lord, thy Spirit which may drive away out of the breaſts of all them that profeſſe thy Name, the wicked ſpirits, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of riot, of covetouſneſſe, of vaine glory, of carnall luſt, of miſchief, and of diſcord. Create in us, O our God and King, a cleane heart, and renew thy holy Spirit in our breaſts, pluck not from us thy holy Ghoſt. Render unto us the joy of thy ſauing health, and with thy principall Spirit, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:7892:201"/>
thy Spouſe and the Herd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men thereof. By this Spirit thou reconciledſt the earthly to the heavenly: by this thou didſt frame and reduce, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tongues, ſo many Nations, ſo many ſundry ſorts of men into one body of a Church; which body by the ſame Spirit is knit to thee their head. This Spirit, if thou wilt vouchſafe to renew in all mens hearts, then ſhall alſo theſe forreigne miſeries ceaſe, or if they ceaſe not, at leaſt they ſhall turne to the profit and availe of them which love thee. Stay this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, ſet in order this horrible Chaos (O Lord Jeſu;) let thy Spirit ſtretch out it ſelf upon theſe waters of evill wavering opinions. And becauſe thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which according to thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſaying co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taineth al things hath alſo the ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſpeaking: make, that like as unto all them which bee of thy houſe, is all one light, one Baptiſme, one God, one hope, one Spirit: ſo they may alſo have one voice, one note, and ſong, profeſſing one Catholique truth. When
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:7892:202"/>
thou diddeſt mount up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven triumphantly, thou threw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt out from above thy preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things, thou gaveſt gifts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, thou dealteſt ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry rewards of thy Spirit. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new againe from above thy old bountifulneſſe, give that thing to thy Church now fainting &amp; growing downward, that thou gaueſt unto her ſhooting up, at her firſt beginning. Give unto Princes and Rulers the grace ſo to ſtand in awe of thee, that they ſo may guide the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Weale, as they ſhould ſhortly render accompt unto thee that art the King of kings. Give wiſdome to bee alwayes aſſiſtant unto them, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is beſt to bee done, they may eſpy it in their minde, and purſue the ſame in their doings. Give to the Biſhops the gift of prophecy, that they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and interpret holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not of their owne braine but of thine inſpiring. Give them the threefold charity which thou once demandedſt of <hi>Peter,</hi> what time thou didſt betake unto him the charge of thy ſheep. Give to the Prieſts
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:7892:202"/>
the love of ſoberneſſe and of chaſtity. Give to thy people a good will to follow thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and a readineſſe to obey ſuch perſons as thou haſt appointed over them. So ſhall it come to paſſe, if through thy gift thy Princes ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that thou requireſt, if thy Paſtors and Herdmen ſhall teach the ſame, and thy people obey them both: that the old dignity and tranquillity of the Church ſhal returne again with a goodly order unto the glory of thy Name. Thou ſparedſt the Ninevites appointed to be deſtroied, as ſoone as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to repentance: and wilt thou deſpiſe thy houſe falling downe at thy feet, which in ſtead of ſackcloth hath ſighes, and in ſtead of aſhes teares? Thou promiſedſt forgiveneſſe to ſuch as turne unto thee, but this ſelf thing is thy gift, a man to turne with his whole heart unto thee, to the intent all our goodneſſe ſhould redound unto thy glory. Thou art the maker, repaire the work that thou haſt faſhioned. Thou art the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer;
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:7892:203"/>
ſave that thou haſt bought. Thou art the Saviour; ſuffer not them to periſh which do hang on thee. Thou art the Lord and owner; challenge thy poſſeſſion. Thou art the head; helpe thy members. Thou art the King; give us a reverence of thy Lawes. Thou art the Prince of peace; breathe upon us brotherly love. Thou art the God, have pity on thy humble beſeechers: be thou, according to <hi>Pauls</hi> ſaying, all things in all men, to the intent, the whole quire of thy Church with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing mindes and conſonant voyces for mercy obtained at thy hands, may give thanks to the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, which after the moſt perfect example of concord, be diſtincted in property of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and one in nature, to whom be praiſe and glory eternally. Amen.</p>
