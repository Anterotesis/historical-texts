            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>HAving received from you ſo good and ſo large an
Account of your Affairs at home, with the great
Fears you are in, I thought it ſome ſmall Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
to give you ſome little Account of the
Government here, and ſome little Obſervations I have been
able to make ſince I came hither, which may ſomething in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
you both of the Manner the Subjects of <hi>France</hi> live
in, and the Strength of the <hi>French</hi> King, in caſe of any
Deſign upon us.</p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Concerning the Government.</head>
               <p>As to the Government of <hi>France;</hi> It is an Abſolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
impoſed upon the People by a ſtanding, ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,
and oppreſſive Army. It is the Corruption of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
from the beſt tempered one (before the Uſe of
States of <hi>France</hi> was laid aſide) to the double Tyranny
of Popery and Arbitrary Power. Here you will find that
Government in its Perfection, being ſupported by all the
<hi>Machiavilian</hi> tricks of a corrupt Policy, and ſuffered by a
People, who having firſt ſubmitted the freeſt part of them
to the ſlavery of Popery, are eaſily brought to ſubmit the
other to the Yoke of Oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>Here the Prince is now only upon the Defenſive part,
only to keep what he has got, which he has brought about
now to be no very hard Task, having inſtilled into the
People ſo great a Vanity of Conquering abroad, that they
are prouder of having their King take a Town, than of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50247:3"/>
poſſeſſing any thing as their own, without being ſubject
to the Griping hand of an Arbitrary Publican. I muſt
confeſs, it has wrought ſo much with me, that it has made
me, as often as I meditate upon the Afflictions of my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
here, thank the Almighty, as much for having pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
me under ſo good a Prince, and ſo good a Government,
(as that of <hi>England</hi>) as for my daily Suſtenance: And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
Sir, it is only to be attributed to the goodneſs of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, and the Excellency of his Majeſties Temper,
that we are not under as great Misfortunes as our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
having not wanted Ambitious and Ill men among
our ſelves, who had they not been diſcovered, and curb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by ſome Noble Patriots, as well as diſcountenanced,
and removed by his Majeſty, from his Perſon and Councels,
might too ſoon have effected their wicked Deſigns.</p>
               <p>You muſt excuſe me, Sir, if I have made ſuch a Digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it being in a thing ſo much concerns Me, and all of us;
but fearing to trouble you with my thoughts of things, you
(being upon the place) can beſt ſee into: I ſhall return
to what I have promiſed, <hi>viz.</hi> Something of the preſent
Government of <hi>France;</hi> or the manner of proceeding, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Tyranny and Arbitrary Power is come to be the ſettled
Government, under an Active Popiſh Prince.</p>
               <p>The Government of <hi>France</hi> is to conſidered, either in
relation to its Subjects or Foreign Intereſt. As to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
the preſent ſtate is this: The Nobility of all ſorts
are very much Oppreſs'd, and their Intereſts are to be
broken, and rendred abſolutely dependent upon the Crown
by theſe Means:</p>
               <p n="1">1. No Favourite ſuffered to form a Faction, or oblige
Dependents, Affairs being Managed by three Upſtarts, only
Aſſiſtants to the Prince, who Acts, and Determines all him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
and thus the Nobility and Gentry are totally laid aſide
as to the Adminiſtration of Government.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:50247:3"/>
2. As to Councel, they are rarely and with great Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
made Uſe of; and that only upon extraordinary Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
none of them being admitted to thoſe Charges that
do render it neceſſary: as the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> Marſhal <hi>Turin,</hi>
who are only made Uſe of in matters of War, and Foreign
Enterprizes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. None of their Mediation admitted between the
Prince and his Subjects, as to publick or private Favours,
Rewards, Preferment, or any Affairs; laying them aſide
as to the Court-Intereſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All thoſe Charges Military or Civil, that may render
them Conſiderable, ſuppreſt or eclipſed, as the high Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable,
high Admiral, and Colonel of the Infantry.</p>
               <p>Governours of Provinces, Towns, Fortreſſes, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clips'd
by theſe means, by Intendants who are Superiours,
placed in every Province, who uſurp the whole Power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Notion of Intendants, over Juſtices, Policy, and
Finances, at firſt only ordained for Finances.</p>
               <p>Theſe render Account only to the King, who admits of
no Superiour Intendant, or high Treaſurer, nor Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Governour; who being thus diveſted of Power,
is reduced alſo to his bare Penſion; alſo the Profits and
Privileges taken away which were conſiderable, and in
Truth is now much the ſame thing with our Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
as to quartering Souldiers, and other Military Affairs.</p>
               <p>As to Towns and Fortreſſes, all Inland ones are demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and Frontiers, ſuch only as are thought neceſſary,
kept up and maintained, all the French Companies former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
belonging to the Governours, ſuppreſt, no Poſſibility
of falſe Muſters, or making Uſe of Towns-men to fill up
the Places, the King ſupplying his Garriſons out of his
ſtanding Army, and taking the Pay of the Provinces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their Maintenance, and charging them every three
Months, by ſelect Companies out of the ſeveral Regiments,
that the Governour and their Officers may not be able by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50247:4"/>
any Correſpondence to have Intreſt in them, or reap any
Advantages for themſelves, notwithſtanding all which, the
Charges are ſaleable, and rarely the greater Nobility ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All Charges both in the Army, Law, Court and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,
are diminiſhed in number, and retrench'd in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
upon which the Nobility heretofore depended; they
are beſide much impoveriſh'd,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the late Expedition into <hi>Flanders,</hi> from which
they were diſmiſſed without Pay or Recompence:</p>
               <p n="2">2. By retrenching their Privileges, as to Exemption
from Tally, reſtraining it to one Farme or Manſion, and
that in one Place, not exceeding two Ploughs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By Project of reviewing the ancient Nobles.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By re-aſſuming all the demeſne Lands of the Crown
as upon a Mortgage.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Pollet</hi> is an ancient Payment of a certain Sum by

diſpoſe of the ſame, though they dye (by Will or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe)

are required by the <hi>High Court of Juſtice,</hi> in an Arbitrary

               <p>I have been informed by <hi>Peaſants,</hi> that out of that little
which belonged to them, they conſtantly paid near two
Thirds to the King: and that thoſe that had only what they
Earned by hard Labour, were not exempt from great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions;
nor were they yet free from the Impoſition of
Salt, <hi>viz.</hi> from being forced to take it at their prices, what
they will think fitting they ſhould ſpend. Secondly, The
<hi>Peaſant,</hi> or loweſt ſort of Common People, are more
favoured than the reſt, as to Impoſitions; the Tallie being
diminiſhed ſome Millions, the manner of leaving it much
Regulated, and multitudes made Contributors, that were
not heretofore; which is done for two Reaſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe there was Neceſſity for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe they are the Kings Laws, that are to yield
to him daily Increaſe, and therefore to be Encouraged and
Cheriſh'd. To which I might add, the Deſign the King
hath of altering that Tax, and making it real, by charging
it upon the Land, which, by throwing it upon the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and eaſing the Perſonal Eſtate, he hopes to bring to
paſs. Nor hath he been leſs favourable to them in the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>

it, and contenting himſelf to be the ſole Merchant; to
which end he purchaſeth all Salt-pans in private hands,
finding, that theſe things were improved by the Partiſans to
a deſtruction of the Duty it ſelf; and his People and the
Government, is at preſent Vigorous in Execution of Laws,
and Impartial in the Execution of Juſtice, Labouring to

               <head>What concerns Foreign Intereſt.</head>
               <p>I ſhall not ſay much, though I could, it being rather Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Hiſtory than Reflection; only this preſent King hath
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50247:6"/>
never omitted his Advantage for any regard of Honour or
Faith, either in making of Treaties, or obſerving of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances:
The <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>France</hi> conſiſts either of Maritime,
or Land Forces; of the latter, I have no exact Account, but
by Computation the King hath fifty or ſixty thouſand Horſe
and Foot, ſince the Disbanding; but according to the beſt
Information, as to the Goodneſs, I hear they decline daily
very much, and that for three reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Diſcipline and Duty being ſo rigorous, that for
want of five men, the Captain ſhall be caſhiered, though
they ran away, and he not able to ſupply it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Pay is ſo ſmall, that neither Officer nor Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
can ſcarce live upon it, beſide Deduction to Horſe and
Foot for Clothing, Hay and Oats; and the pay of a Captain
of Foot, <hi>per diem</hi> being fifty Soulz; a Lieutenant thirty
Soulz; Enſign fifteen Soulz; Souldier five Soulz: a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Horſe ſix Livres, Lieutenant three, Cornet two
Livres five Soulz.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The great Diſcouragement of old Officers, and new
ones too, by the late Diſbanding without Pay, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only ſuch in Pay, as were able at their own Charges to
keep up their Company; and taking away all Privileges in
Muſter, or otherwiſe, for ſo many Horſes, for ſo many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and their allowance for Table, beſide moſt of their
old Boyes are ſpoiled by Diſbanding of part: to which I
may add, that the <hi>Switzers, Scottiſh,</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſuch diſcouragement, that they have almoſt quitted the
Army: but yet to do the King right, he entertains all refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Officers at half Pay, and daily forbids the ſale of Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Offices, and, for the moſt part, beſtows them according
to Seniority, unleſs it be in his Guards, keeps them under
good Diſcipline, Pays punctually, Exerciſes them frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
makes them take their turn in <hi>Flanders;</hi> and laſtly,
gives many conſiderable Penſions, and the truth is, Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to deſtroy all other Supports, both of them and of
the Nobility and Gentry, and to make them all to depend ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely

               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:50247:6"/>
As for the <hi>Militia</hi> by Sea, all that I ſhall ſay by way of
Reflection is, that he doth vigorouſly endeavour the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
and Propagation of Trade and building of Ships, to
which end, he is reported to make up his Fleet 100 Sail, and
daily encreaſe his Stores, by purchaſing and cutting down
Timber he finds fit for it, and alſo hath found out great Store
of Maſts of Timber of his own, with Pitch and Tar, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
men out of <hi>Swethland</hi> to teach the making of it here, ſome
Defects I find at preſent, which time may rectifie; his Ships
are built too high and too narrow, the Guns carry not above
28 <hi>l.</hi> Bullet: they want Guns, and treat Strangers but ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they have got them into Service; the Pay of Seamen is
but ten Livres a Moneth, wherein Diet is reckoned; this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
by each particular Captain; their Gallies worſt
ſerved, only by condemned Perſons, which they change per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually.
They have received an Opinion, that by the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Powder, and manner of Charging, that they can make
their Guns equal the Force of thoſe which are bigger; and
in purſuit hereof, they daily caſt great Guns they find in Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons
into this Proportion, which may do well enough for
Land, but not for Sea Service. To which I may add, the Port
he hath cauſed to be built at <hi>Charante, Haure</hi> and other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
he hath laid out ſeveral Millions at <hi>Charante,</hi> but to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Purpoſe, through the Knavery and Indiſcretion of thoſe
that are Overſeers, that he is laught at by moſt that ſees it,
with a Reparation of Fortifications of the reſt of the Ports
and Havens, and the many Works he hath provided in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Places for the caſting of Ordnance, Anchors, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
Materials for ſhipping and all warlike Munitions, and
the great Encouragement he gives to all Gentlemen to go to
Sea, and above all theſe the manner whereby he promotes
Trade and building Ships of Force by private men, (which
ſhall farther be ſhewed under the Head of Trade.) As for the
Governour himſelf the King of <hi>France,</hi> I ſhall be ſparing in his
Character, becauſe he is ſo well known that I might run the
Danger of Flattery, I ſhall only remark the moſt eminent Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
in him.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:50247:7"/>
1. Induſtry; being the Doer of all things himſelf, making
choice of fit Inſtruments to act under him, both for Advice
and Execution; not ſuch as can incline him, reſerving the
Determination and account of all that is done unto himſelf;
and but one day in the Week that he is not perſonally preſent
in his Councels.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A well-ſtated Reſerve in his Comportment; being eaſie
of Acceſs to all men of Buſineſs, and incommunicable to all
other Familiarities.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The great Command over his Paſſions; which he expreſſes
upon all occaſions, and government of his Tongue, whereby he
obtains a great Secrecy, and renders his Councels inſearchable.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His unparallel'd Conſtancy in theſe and all other his
Meaſures, not quitting Friendſhip with any one he hath once
made choice of, whether of his Favourite, Miniſters, or beloved
Miſtreſſes, notwithſtanding the unſucceſsful Undertakings of
the firſt, as in the buſineſs of <hi>Gydgery</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> Eaſt and Weſt
<hi>India</hi> Trade, and new Manufacturies.</p>
               <p>To this I may oppoſe, by way of Balance;</p>
               <p n="1">1. His great Parcimony; which may rather ſerve an Exceſs
of Virtue than of Vice; whereby the Services done to him are
not ſo well rewarded; all the Eſtates of men depending upon
him, not ſupported, they by that means being Indigent and
Diſcontented. This ſeems grounded upon the Experiment he
had of the Misfortune of his Anceſtors, by their contrary Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
not from any inclination in him to Avarice; which is
ſufficiently confirmed in him, by his Enterpriſes, which have
alwayes been carefully ſuſtained by his Magnificent Buildings
Furniture, and Fortreſſes, as alſo by his ſumptuous and ſpl<gap reason="illegible: damage" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

with the care he takes to beſtow liberal Penſions, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments
and Rewards, upon ſuch as have deſerved well of
him in Civil or Military Employments, not ſuffering them
to make any Advantage, or to take one penny more than
their Wages or Salary, from any of his Subjects, or others,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50247:7"/>
for the diſcharging of their Offices, and turning them out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly,
and puniſhing them ſeverely when they do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
thereby obliging them to Fidelity, Induſtry, and an
abſolute Dependency upon him, and by his employing the
meaner ſort in Buildings, Manufactories, Fortreſſes, in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
and <hi>France,</hi> Magazines, new Chanells, Havens, Shipping
and Trade at his own Expence, thereby making the Money
circulate quick.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is too rigorous in his Diſcipline and Execution of
Laws and Reformation of Buſineſs even to a degree of ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Injuſt, as the Military Diſcipline, Treatment of <hi>Fawket</hi> and
the <hi>Partizans</hi> Reduction of Offices and Officers do evidence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His perſonal Vices are too publick to the World, and
too open in his own Kingdom, whereby Corruption of Manners
is produced in his Court, and amongſt the Nobility, even
to the ſpreading it ſelf to all Degrees and Sexes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Amongſt his Defects may alſo be reckoned his not being
regardful enough of his Faith and Honour in matters of Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
where his Intereſt is concerned.</p>

               <head>Concerning Trade.</head>
               <p>The Enlargement and Advantage of Trade ſeems to be
one of the greateſt Deſigns of this Crown, nor is there any
Coſt ſpared therein; as well appears by theſe enſuing Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their Endeavours to enlarge both Foreign and Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
Trade; as to Foreign, the erecting of <hi>Eaſt India</hi> and
<hi>Weſt India</hi> and Northern Companies, the encouraging and
Countenancing them with great Priviledges, both real and
perſonal, and exempting the Commerce from derogating No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
their Commodities from all Inland Duties either Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial,
or Entries into Towns or otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Aſſiſting them with great Sums of Money, <hi>viz.</hi> a fifth
part of their Stock, and fifty <hi>Solz</hi> for all Goods outward, and
ſeventy five for all Goods inward, out of his Coffers; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging

all his great Officers with Priviledge of Exemption
from Reſidence and Duty there, and impoſing upon all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of Ability, to go a ſhare in the Stock, thereby not only
engaging them in point of Intereſt, but Experience and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Trade. As to Domeſtick Trade by encouraging all
Manufactors already ſetled here, and introducing all Others,
this Nation is capable of, or his Uſe of at his Expence, (he is
blamed for attempting alſo ſuch as are not for their Uſe, and
which they can never afford at the ſame Rate which others
ſell at) as alſo the great advance of the Trade of Silk, Salt,
and Linnen, and the ſetting upon the Dutch and foreign Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures
do ſufficiently evidence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Having reduced all Home Duties into one receit, to ſave
the Expence of ſo many Officers, and of Time, is another great
Encouragement of Domeſtick Trade; to all theſe I may add,
the Advance of Duty upon all Foreign Merchandize, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
made againſt all Foreign Manufacturies, the Favouring
the Artizan, as to Table; but above all, the Example of the
Prince, in confining himſelf to the wearing his Manufacturies,
and obliging all his Dependents to the like obſervance, is of
great Importance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Increaſe of Navigation and Shipping is procured by
theſe means.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Giving 500<hi>l.</hi> out of his own Cuſtoms, by way of Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement

ſhall build, of above 100 Tuns burden, and 400 Livres for all

               <p n="3">3. Electing an Northern Company to furniſh his Subjects
with Proviſions of Shipping at the beſt hand, and alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to find the Materials in his own Countrey, as I
have already obſerved.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Giving their Shipping Preference of Employment, as the

French Ships at ſuch a Rate before any Strangers, as alſo
fifty ſoulz <hi>per</hi> Tun impoſed upon Forreign Veſſels.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Endeavouring to make his Subjects ſole Merchants of all
Trades, as well imported as exported, and not only by the
Priviledges already mentioned upon their Commodities and
Ships, but alſo by putting all manner of Diſcouragements up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all Foreign Factories and Merchants by Difficulty in their
Diſpatches, delayes in point of Juſtice, ſubjecting them to
Foreign Duties and Seizures, not ſuffering them to be Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
to the French or any other Nation but their own, and
in caſe of Death to have their Eſtates ſeized as <hi>Aliens,</hi> and
the Countenance and conceiving the <hi>French</hi> have as to all

               <head>Concerning Revenue.</head>
               <p>The whole Revenue of the Crown is Eighty Millions; all
Charges deducted, comes to ſixty Millions of Livres yearly,
not poſſible to be augmented; the Clergy, Nobility, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans
being already pared and pilled, the Tallies and Gabals
in moſt places, upon the meaner ſort, being ſo far ſtretcht, that
they require abatement: Eſpecially in reſpect of Ceſſation of
War, and Interruption of Trade with Foreigners, by reaſon
of their new Projects about Trade; but in general, this I muſt
ſay, that there never was more care taken in managing of the
Kings Revenues by Superiour, as well as Inferiour Officers,
and am informed, that the Tally is ſo regulated, that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
in Levying it comes not to above a twentieth part; but
its Arbitrary manner of Collecting the Tally, is thus: The
King ſends down to the Intendant what he intends to Levy
upon the Province by way of Tally; the Intendant conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Elect of each Diviſion, returns up word what he thinks
it able to bear that year, with the reaſons thereof; then the
King ſixeth the Sum; then the Elects are convened to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
the Sum upon each Diviſion; And laſtly, the Intendant
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50247:10"/>
adviſeth with the Elect; fixes the Sum upon each Pariſh, as
he pleaſeth, (which is practiſed very Arbitrary) and alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points
the Aſſeſſors in the Pariſh, (who are anſwerable for
the Taxes upon the Pariſh out of their own Eſtates) and may
impoſe the ſame Arbitrarily upon their Neighbours, yet moſt
of them of any Subſtance take their Turns, and are much regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by new Edicts, in impoſing and levying the ſame. If
there be any complaint made, that the Pariſh is over-burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Remedy is by Petition to the Intendant, who, upon
Examination, doth as he ſees cauſe; and the Appeal from him
is only to the King, which is rarely or never practiſed; for
thoſe that are great men, and concerned at Court, are alwayes
favoured by the Intendant, and for the reſt he matters them
not. The Intendant, as I ſaid before, is an Officer Elected to

ſuch Grievances, Inconveniences, and Complaints, as are not

but men Induſtrious, bred up to the Law. If there be
any complaint between the Aſſeſſours and their Neighbours,
this is determined at the Court of the Elect. Now it is to be
known, theſe Elects are certain Officers, who buy their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and are appointed by the King for each Diviſion, though
poſſibly in their beginning they were elected by each Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
There lies an Appeal from them to the Courts of Aids,
where alſo Proceſs iſſues forth againſt the Aſſeſſors, if any Sum
be behind; which Courts are aſſiſted with the Chamber of
Accounts; theſe hold Plea generally of all Matters relating to
the Revenue, and the Edicts concerning the ſame, are now
uſed to be Regiſtred there, and not in Parliament.</p>

they regard <hi>France,</hi> whoſe great Hopes that <hi>England</hi> will be corrupted,

to fortifie <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſubdue all <hi>Parties</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> at Home, ſettle
the Revenue of the Crown, to keep up a conſiderable Army alwayes in

unprofitable to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> burthenſome to our ſelves, without
