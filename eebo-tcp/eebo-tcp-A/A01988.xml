            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thought it no lesse, then my bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>den dutye (after I had perused this worke) to do my indeuor, that the same might be put in printe, whereby others might be part takers with me therein. For after I had red the same, and fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng therein, so heauenly doctryne, so consonant and agreynge wyth goddes booke, and so mete for thuse of all esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and sortes of people (beynge christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) thought I should do iniury to god,

and wronge to my Christen bretherne, yf I shoulde anye lenger deteigne the same from them. And as I knowe not the author thereof, no more founde I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny title or name geuen vnto the booke. But for that the author tooke (as it were for his theame) the beginninge of the 7. Chapiter of Iob where hee say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. The lyfe of man is a warfare vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the earthe and hys dayes lyke the dayes of an hyred seruaunt.

            <p>Wherefore that the name of the booke might agre with the worke, I thought it good to attribute to the same suche a name, as the worcke desired: (that is to saye) godly and necessary rules to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised and put in practyse, by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes souldyers, lyuynge in the campe of this worlde. And in the diligent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge of this worke, and disgestinge of the same: thou shalte well perceaue (deere reder) that the lyfe of a very chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian (of what estate or degree so euer he be) to exceade and far passe, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfayte lyues of cloyning cloysterars, of mummynge monkes, fonde fryers, or of hypochrytical heremytes, and that we nede not ronne to seke a strayte lyfe among the Chart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:6089:4"/>
maketh vs Christians before God, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we haue also the dedes of Christy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as Christe sayeth in Mathewe the 7. Not whosoeuer sayethe vnto mee Lorde Lorde, shall enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, but he that doeth the wil of my father. And in the 6. of Luke he sayeth. Why call ye me, maister &amp; Lorde, and do not that I byd ye. And Saint Iohn sayeth in his first Epystle and 2. Chapyter. He that sayeth I knowe him, and kepethe not his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes is a lyer, and the truth is not in him. So that as the name of a Iewe maketh not a Iewe. Romayns 2.

As Christe sayeth in Mathew the 5. Let your light so shyne before men, that they seynge your good workes may glorify your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heauen. And that they

Haue peace with all men, but be at defyaunce with syn, (God graunt that this Heathen philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher rise not at the Iudgemente, to condempne a nomber of vs Christians for oure negligence.) So that now I hope) it is apparant to all eyes that wil not wilfully be blynd: that it is the duty of al christians to liue so straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye in this worlde, and so earnestlye to wrastle againste vyce, and sinne, as the weaknes of our fleshe shal or can beare in oure myndes detestynge and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge synne, and from the bottome of our hartes to wyshe that we coulde not sinne. For it is our partes to wrastle against the same, and therein hath the holye ghost by his elect vessell Saynct Paule comforted vs saying in the 1. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the Corinth. 10. God is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full whiche shall not suffer you to bee tempted aboue your strength, but shal in the myddest of temptacion, make a waye that ye maye be able to beare it.
<pb facs="tcp:6089:5"/>
And what we are not able to doe, by reason of our weaknes, that hath christ fulfilled for vs, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same apostle saith also to the Romaynes the. 8. For what the lawe could not do in as muche as it was weake, bycause of the fleshe, that performed God, and sente hys sonne in the similytude of sinfull flesh. &amp;c. And in the beginning of the same Chapiter he sayeth. There is then nowe no dampnacion to them that are graffed in Christ Iesu. What? to do what they lyst? and to ronne carelesly hedlonge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to synne? Naye he addeth: Whyche walke not after the flesh but after the sprite. As God himselfe sayeth in le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit. 15. Be ye holye for I am holye. So that the lyfe of euerye true Christian, oughte to be suche as no man worthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can rebuke: whiche thynge is moste pientifully, and at the full, set forth in this godly worke. And thys I write, onely to stoppe the mouthes of suche, as slaunderously reporte and saye that these newe preachers (for so it pleaseth them to tearme, suche as moste syncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye preach Gods trueth) would haue no

So ye also when ye haue done all that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded you, say we are vnprofitable seruantes, we haue done y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> whiche was our duty to do. And therfore sayeth S. Paule in the 2. to the Ephesians. For by grace are ye saued, through faythe, and that not of your selues. For it is the guyfte of God, and not of workes, least any man should boaste. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, that we shoulde not mystake S. Paule, and thinke that the opinyon of faith were inough &amp; therfore we might be ydle, and liue careleslye, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier or regarde of vertue, he immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye addeth sayinge.

And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto geue all diligence, in your faythe, minister vertue, in vertue, knowledge &amp;c. And then he concludeth, saying: If these thinges be with you, and be plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, they will make you that ye ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shalbe ydle nor vnfruitefull in the knowledge of our lord Iesus christ, but he y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hath not these things, he is blinde, groping the way wyth hys hande, hath forgotten himselfe, to haue bene pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from his olde sinnes.

So that where those vertues be, there doth god in dede open his secre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/> tes by his holye sprite. I write not this that I meane therby to dyscourage any from learning, but rather I exhorte all men to set their children thereunto, and speciallye to the vniuersities, whereby good litterature maye be maynteyned in the youth, whiche are the sede of the common wealthe of thys realme, and god his trueth syncerly preached. But
<pb facs="tcp:6089:16"/>
I onelie inuaye against those papistes, whiche saye that suche learned men, as mayntayne their errors, are learned, they are Bushoppes: they haue study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the scriptures, so manye yeares and so many yeares, and how can it be, but that these must nedes vnderstande the scriptures? Ye, and some saye, it is not possyble for anye man to vnderstande the scryptures, vnlesse he were a grad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate of the vnyuersytie, but whether this impossibilytye be true or no, bothe the scryptures aboue recyted and also experyence in these our dayes (thankes be to God) dothe proue the contrarye, for that there be diuers whiche neuer came in the vniuersities, yea, and some suche as haue no more but their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers tonge, doe vnderstande the scryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and able to teache good &amp; sounde doctrine. But howe those men vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande the scriptures (whiche bragge so muche of their doctryne, and contynu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of theyr studye) by their doctryne is apparaunte, for seke they oughte in all theyr preachynges and doynges other

But yet so litle regarded with them, that rather it was winked at then spoken against. If a man hadde sworne neuer so great an othe in tearing of God, ye shoulde haue had that marke (the popes shauelynges I meane) syt by and say neuer a worde.

The fyrst man was made a lyuing soule, the seconde a quickeninge or geuinge life. The spiritual part was not first made, but the beastely: The first manne

Here you maye euy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently se that what Paule in one place called the exteriourman and the fleshe whiche is corruptyble: In another place he calleth it the earthely Adam. And suerlye this is the same flesh, the same body of death, where with he was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled when he sayde. O vnhappye creature, who shall delyuer me from the body of this death?

O happy and fortunate manne in whom this earthelie Adam is so mortified and subdewed that it in no wise resysteth the spirite. But whether this perfecte quietenesse and tranquilitie maye fortune to any man in this worlde I wil not affyrme. Peraduenture it is not necessary to be. For Paule in this <note place="margin">S.
