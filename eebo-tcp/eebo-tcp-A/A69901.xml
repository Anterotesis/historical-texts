            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Have the honour of being one of your <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties</hi> in the County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> which I hope will admit me to the freedome of placing your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> in the Front of Two <hi>Reports</hi> cull'd out from the many other <hi>Reports</hi> of two as Learned perſons in our Laws as that Age did afford.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57830:3"/>I have perſwaded the <hi>Stationer</hi> to reprint them, as fit at this time to be generally perus'd. For Sr. <hi>John Davis,</hi> in his Report of <hi>Lalor</hi>'s Caſe, gives an Hiſtoricall Account of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Invaſions upon us from <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confeſſor</hi>'s time in matters <hi>Civil</hi>; and the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Coke</hi> gives alſo a full and clear Account of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Intruſions</hi> upon us in matters <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall.</hi> Neither of them do meddle with the Cavills of <hi>Religion</hi> between us and the <hi>Papal Power,</hi> but what concerns their State and ours, and that deduced from Antiquity; how we ought to pay our ſingle Obedience both to <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> (as our Predeceſſors have done, or endeavour'd to doe, for many Ages, to their reſpective Kings.) And though there have been many <hi>Invaſions</hi> or <hi>Intruſions</hi> upon us by the Power and Policy of the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Agents, yet we were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſtruggling to get out: Sometimes we maſtered them, and ſometimes we were maſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them; according to the Reſolution or Weakneſs of thoſe our former <hi>Kings</hi> who were to maintain their inherent Intereſts. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſome <hi>Papal</hi> Pretences ſeem to be, yet we may clearly ſee (when they got the upper hand)
<pb facs="tcp:57830:3"/>
what Subjection they intended to impoſe upon us, as they did on <hi>King John</hi>; and they nick'd the time when he was imbroyl'd and even totally immerged in the Diſtempers of his untruly <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> and inraged <hi>Forreiners:</hi> and then, by the opportunity of thoſe <hi>Factions</hi> and <hi>Forrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> they did ſubjugate this <hi>Kingdome</hi> to his <hi>Principality</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and made it its Vaſſall more then ever any <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> did pretend to, or could accompliſh. And though after <hi>King John,</hi> there were various Conteſts by our ſucceſſive <hi>Kings,</hi> yet none did ſo effectually rout the <hi>Papal Intereſt</hi> here as <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>VIII.</hi> for which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do rip up all his Vices, to make him as odious to the world as poſſible: and among other things they affirm, <hi>that He was the man that rebell'd from their Church.</hi> (Whenas their Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and ours tell us, and them, that he lived and died a <hi>Roman Catholick.</hi>) And they farther ſay, <hi>that it was He that brought in our Religion</hi>; which they now call <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and is but a <hi>Reformation</hi> of theirs: and even, that <hi>Reformation</hi> was begun and proſecuted (though but in parcells) by former Ages, but not eſtabliſht till <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>VIII.</hi> had firſt
<pb facs="tcp:57830:4"/>
broke their Civil Intereſt here, and then it went on with eaſe by <hi>King Henry</hi>'s Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours.</p>
            <p>But by their Railings on <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>VIII. Luther, Calvin,</hi> and I know not whom, (whoſe Doctrines we do not altogether follow) the <hi>Papal</hi> Agents do moſt wonderfully deceive the <hi>unfixt</hi> and wavering minds of men, who do not know the true Foundation of our Church and State here in <hi>England,</hi> clearly and through all Antiquity <hi>independent</hi> upon any <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State</hi> but its own, or on any perſon but the <hi>Monarch</hi> thereof; as is moſt fully ſet forth in theſe excellent <hi>Reports,</hi> wherein your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> and others by an hour's reading may ſee what is our Right, and how it hath been maintain'd, and loſt, and regain'd by that moſt reſolute <hi>Prince,</hi> then owning the whole Body of the <hi>Papal Doctrine,</hi> but not the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority</hi> or power to eſtabliſh any thing in theſe Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>It is true, this <hi>Prince</hi> had Diſcontents, and was croſt in his Deſigns, which it may be did either provoke him, or upon this it is likely he
<pb facs="tcp:57830:4"/>
did take occaſion to pick a quarrel, that he might the more ſpeciouſly accompliſh what his Predeceſſours could not effect. However, God doth often produce good Events by ſuch as we call evill <hi>Mediums:</hi> as the Beams of the Sun make their way through Darkneſſe and Vapours; which now again begin to ſpread o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our heads like thick Clouds contracted by long Exhalations, ready to break and ſend forth Lightning, <hi>Thunder</hi> and Storms upon this Nation. And thus I apprehend their <hi>contraction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>VIII.</hi> had thus reſtor'd us to our Liberties and ancient Rights, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded the <hi>Papall</hi> Power and Intereſt here, it was time for the <hi>Pope</hi> to contrive ſome other <hi>Stratagems</hi>; and therefore what he could not doe by the power of <hi>Bulls, &amp;c.</hi> he tries to effect by a long and continued <hi>Art.</hi> And firſt, he infuſeth into his <hi>Catholick King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> how fit a perſon he was to be <hi>Univerſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi> of Chriſtendome: which the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Ambition readilie embraced, (the whole Deſign whereof may be read in <hi>Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella</hi> the Jeſuite, in his Diſcourſe of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<pb facs="tcp:57830:5"/>
Monarchy.</hi>) About the ſame time the <hi>Pope</hi> alſo inveigles his moſt <hi>Chriſtian King, Henry</hi> the <hi>IV.</hi> of <hi>France</hi>; telling him alſo how fit a perſon he was to be <hi>Univerſal Moderator</hi> of Chriſtendome: which Bait this <hi>King</hi>'s Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition did alſo readily embrace, (the whole Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell and Platform where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f is alſo ſet down by the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rhodes</hi> in his Hiſtory of the ſaid <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>IV.</hi>) And in all this time, while both theſe <hi>Kings</hi> were driving on theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, it is obſervable (by the Confeſſion of thoſe Hiſtorians) that neither of them were privy to each other's <hi>Intentions,</hi> the buſineſs was ſo cunningly managed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> whoſe great Art it was to keep their Deſigns ſecret, and put both their Wheels in motion at once; yet to keep his Spoak in that Wheel which tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned moſt to his advantage.</p>
            <p>In both theſe cited Books (of <hi>Rhodes</hi> and <hi>Campanella</hi>) your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> will find that their chief aims and directions were to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> and therein they ſay in theſe words, <hi>That there was no better way then by cauſing Diviſions and Diſſenſions among the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>and by continuall keeping up
<pb facs="tcp:57830:5"/>
the ſame; and that as for their Religion, it could not be eaſily rooted out unleſs there were ſome certain Schools erected in</hi> Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>&amp;c. by the Scholars whereof there ſhould be ſcattered abroad the ſeeds for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions in the Natural and Theologicall Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, which would diſtract and diſcompoſe their opinions and judgments: and that the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>being of a nature ſtill deſirous of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties and Changes, are eaſily wrought over to any thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that this hath been put in practice I think is obvious to every man; and as clear, that whilſt all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> are in Arms and Confuſions, onely the <hi>Pope</hi> ſits quiet, and <hi>ſmiles</hi> to ſee what work he makes among us, reſolving (if not prevented) to tire every man out of his <hi>Religion</hi> that ſhall withdraw, not onely a total, but even the leaſt part of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his <hi>Chair.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus many poor ſouls are captivated, (eſpecially thoſe of our Nation, for whom this is intended) ſome being perſwaded to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57830:6"/>
but not the <hi>Power</hi> of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>; and when they are plauſibly got into the firſt, they do not conſider how inſenſibly and inevitably they are <hi>enſnar'd</hi> into the other. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the diſtinction of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſo ridiculous, that it is a mere Irap for weak, unknowing and unreſolved perſons: for ſurely the <hi>Pope</hi> will never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to reſign his <hi>Temporalties</hi> to thoſe <hi>Princes</hi> from whom his Predeceſſors uſurpt them, to take upon him meerly the duty of the <hi>Church.</hi> So that when one of them perſwades you to turn to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is but to make you to turn or be ſubject to the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> (and its <hi>Cardinalls,</hi> who are but a Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Temporall Princes</hi>) and to all its temporall Impoſitions, to maintain ſuch <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> under the title of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and ſhrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under the Canopy of <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> and <hi>Piety.</hi> The truth is, the Queſtions about <hi>Religion</hi> are purpoſely rais'd and infus'd to intoxicate other mens brains: for the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> do but laugh at the things call'd <hi>Merit, Idolatry, Supererogation,</hi> &amp;c. whilſt many of their zealous Agents here (I perſwade my ſelf out of pure Piety) are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb facs="tcp:57830:6"/>
to die upon the ſpot in the defence of thoſe <hi>Tenents</hi>; whereas, poor ſouls, they might ſee (if they would) that that <hi>Court</hi> is onely to imploy them under the ſhrowds of Piety to bring in Griſt to the Mill by <hi>money</hi> and <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurping</hi> other mens <hi>territories</hi>; ſo as the ancient and important queſtion, why we ſhould not give unto the <hi>King</hi> the things that are the <hi>King</hi>'s, is quite laid aſide, and the queſtion is almoſt now, why we ſhould not give to the <hi>Pope</hi> the things that are the <hi>King</hi>'s, and ſubjugate this <hi>Kingdome</hi> to their <hi>Principalities.</hi> And thus by deceiving even their own Agents with a pretence of driving on <hi>Piety,</hi> (which is onely <hi>Sovereignty</hi>) even many of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves are innocently betray'd, and ſo are become betrayers of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Hiſtoricall part.

               <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>VIII.</hi> was re-aſſum'd in caſting off the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Power,</hi> and a Foundation laid for eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing a <hi>Church</hi> here, by a Form of <hi>Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> free from the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Errours</hi> of the <hi>Papal</hi> Court and Church: and (though ſome Interruption was given by <hi>Queen Mary,</hi> yet) what was wanting by <hi>King Edward</hi>'s ſhort Reign, was compleated by <hi>Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> who in her very firſt year, by the full Conſent of the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, by example of many of her Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, did enact, <hi>That no forrein Potentate or perſon ſhould exerciſe any power within any of her Dominions; and all Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Juriſdiction ſhould be annext to the Crown.</hi> And in the 5. year of her Reign in particular it was enacted, <hi>That whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall acknowledge any Juriſdiction of the Biſhop or See of</hi> Rome <hi>within any of her Dominions ſhould be guilty of a</hi> Praemunire, <hi>they, and their acceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that the Principles of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of our <hi>Reformed</hi> Church might the better be known, the frame of it
<pb facs="tcp:57830:7"/>
made in <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>VI.</hi> his time, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with ſome few alterations, and 39 <hi>Articles</hi> eſtabliſhed as a <hi>Foundation</hi> and <hi>Standard</hi> of our <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> diſtinct from that of the <hi>Court,</hi> as alſo reformed from that of the <hi>Church,</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſince her time even to this, whilſt we have thought our ſelves <hi>ſecure</hi> from the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal</hi> Authority, their Religion hath <hi>ſlily</hi> crept in and incroacht among us: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their many known ways, they have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular art of <hi>incouraging</hi> and <hi>fomenting</hi> all publick and private <hi>Differences</hi> and <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,</hi> purſuant to their <hi>ſecret</hi> Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the advancement of the <hi>Papal</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>Now, as it is impoſſible for the art of <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick</hi> to reduce the 4 <hi>Humors</hi> of a man's Body into one; ſo no arts of <hi>Policy</hi> can reduce the temper of men into one <hi>Perſuaſion</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>So that herein the wiſdom of our Counſellors
<pb facs="tcp:57830:8"/>
is diſcerned, in contriving that their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber may not come near the <hi>balance</hi> of the <hi>ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> or <hi>eſtabliſht</hi> intereſt of this Kingdom, both as to <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> wherein we are to ſhew our ſelves (like our predeceſſors) true <hi>Engliſh</hi>-men, and not to <hi>Italianate</hi> our ſelves to the <hi>Dependency</hi> of any other State.</p>
            <p>And that this may be the more <hi>charitably</hi> perform'd, they may be diſtinguiſht into <hi>Actives,</hi> and <hi>Paſſives.</hi> By <hi>Actives</hi> I mean ſuch as make it their whole buſineſs to pervert and <hi>captivate</hi> our Subjects to be ſubject to the <hi>Pope,</hi> under the notion of <hi>Religion</hi>; and by <hi>Paſſives</hi> I mean ſuch as live <hi>innocently</hi> among us: and there is leſſe caution and ſtrictneſs requiſite to thoſe who are <hi>paſſive</hi> in reſpect bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of their Religion, then to thoſe who are <hi>active</hi> in <hi>promoting</hi> it.</p>
            <p>And therefore many ancient <hi>Laws</hi> have been made long before <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>VIII.</hi> entituled Statutes of <hi>Praemunire</hi>; which word in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> is, to <hi>fortify</hi> a place before enemies come, or to <hi>provide</hi> againſt any <hi>onſet</hi> by them.

<pb facs="tcp:57830:8"/>
all thoſe Laws are intended againſt the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Spirituall</hi> or <hi>Temporall Invaſions</hi> upon us: and thoſe Laws do impoſe <hi>Penalties</hi> on ſuch as ſhall any ways endeavour to <hi>aſſiſt</hi> him in ſuch <hi>Invaſions</hi>; ſo that being <hi>forewarn'd,</hi> (as ſome would have the word from <hi>praemonere,</hi>) we may the better be <hi>fore-armed</hi> for prevention of all their future attempts upon us, which is heartily wiſht by,</p>

               <p>To this Inditement <hi>Lalor</hi> pleaded <hi>Not guilty</hi>; and when the iſſue was to be tried, the name and reputation of the man, and the nature of the cauſe, drew all the principal Gentlemen both of the <hi>Pale</hi> and <hi>Provinces</hi> that were in town to the hearing of the matter.

               <p n="1">1. What reaſon moved us to ground this Inditement upon the old Statute of 16 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. rather then upon ſome other later Law made ſince the time of King <hi>Henr.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What were the true cauſes of the making of this Law of 16 <hi>Rich.</hi> and other former Laws againſt <hi>Proviſors</hi> and ſuch as did appeal to the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> in thoſe times, when both the Prince and people of <hi>England</hi> did for the moſt part acknowledge the Pope to be the <hi>thirteenth Apoſtle,</hi> and onely oracle in matters of Religion, and did follow his doctrine in moſt of thoſe points wherein we now diſſent from him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the firſt Point, we did purpoſely forbear to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt him upon any later Law, to the end that ſuch as were ignorant might be informed, that long before King <hi>Henr.</hi> 8. was born, divers Laws were made againſt the Uſurpation of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> upon the rights of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> well-nigh as ſharp and as ſevere as any Statutes which have been made in later times; and that therefore we made choice to proceed upon a Law made
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57830:12"/>
more then 200 years paſt, when the King, the Lords and Commons, which made the Laws, and the Judges, which did interpret the Laws, did for the moſt part follow the ſame opinions in Religion which were taught and held in the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>

For the ſecond Point, the cauſes that moved and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt enforced the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation to make this, and other Statutes of the ſame nature, were of the greateſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that could poſſibly ariſe in any State.

               </p>
               <p>For albeit the Kings of <hi>England</hi> were abſolute Emperours within their Dominions, and had under them as learned a Prelacy and Clergy, as valiant and prudent a Nobility, as free and wealthy a Commonalty, as any was then in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom: yet if we look into the ſtories and records of theſe two Imperial Kingdoms, we ſhall find, that if theſe Laws of <hi>Proviſion</hi> and <hi>Praemunire</hi> had not been made, they had loſt the name of Imperial, and of Kingdoms too, and had been long ſince made Tributary Provinces to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or rather part of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Patrimony in demeſne. Our Kings had had their Scepters wreſted out of their hands, their Crowns ſpurned off from their heads, their necks trod upon, they had been made Lacquays or Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as ſome of the Emperours and <hi>French</hi> Kings were; our Prelates had been made his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains and Clerks, our Nobility his Vaſſals and Servants, our Commons his Slaves and Villains, if theſe Acts of manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion had not freed them. In a word, before the making of theſe Laws, the flouriſhing Crown and Commonwealth of <hi>England</hi> was in extream danger to have been brought into moſt miſerable ſervitude and ſlavery, under colour of Religion and devotion to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> And this was not onely ſeen and felt by the King, and much repined at and proteſted againſt by the Nobility, but the Commons, the general multitude of the Subjects, did exclaim and cry

And their faith and loyaltie hath been generally ſuch, (though every Age hath brought forth ſome particular monſters of diſloyaltie) as no pretence of zeal or religion could ever withdraw the greater part of the Subjects to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a forrein yoke, no not when Popery was in her height and exaltation;<note place="margin">The Statute of Praemunire made at the prayer of the Commons.</note> whereof this Act and divers others of the ſame kind are clear and manifeſt teſtimonies.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57830:13"/>
the Lords in Parliament, what they thought of theſe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt wrongs and uſurpations, and whether they would ſtand with the King in defence of his Royall liberties, or no. Which the King did according to their Petition: and the Lords Spiritual and Temporal did all anſwer, that theſe Uſurpations of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> were againſt the liberties of the Crown, and that they were all bound by their allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to ſtand with the King, and to maintain his honour and Prerogative. And thereupon it was enacted with a full conſent of the three Eſtates, That ſuch as ſhould pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> or elſewhere, any <hi>Bulls</hi> or <hi>Proceſſes,</hi> or other things which might touch the King in his Crown and dignitie Royall, and ſuch as ſhould bring them into the Realm, and ſuch as ſhould receive them, publiſh them, or execute them, they, their Notaries, Proctors, Maintainors and Counſellors, ſhould be all out of the King's protection, their lands and goods forfeited to the King, their bodies at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached if they might be found, or elſe proceſſe of <hi>Pramuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re facias</hi> to be awarded againſt them.

For there all the Commons of the Realm do grievouſly complain, That whereas the Holy Church of <hi>England</hi> was firſt founded in eſtate of Prelacie by the Kings and Nobilitie of that Realm, and by them endowed with great poſſeſſions and revenues in lands, rents and Advowſons, to the end the people might be informed in Religion, Hoſpitality might be kept, and other works of Charitie might be exerciſed within the Realm; And whereas the King and other founders of the ſaid Prelacies were the rightfull Patrons and Adowees there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and upon avoidance of ſuch Eccleſiaſticall promotions had power to advance thereunto their kinſmen, friends, and other learned men of the birth of that Realm, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo advanced became able and worthy perſons to ſerve the King in Counſell, and other places in the Commonweal: The Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> uſurping the Seigniory of ſuch poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Benefices, did give and grant the ſame to Aliens, which did never dwell in <hi>England,</hi> and to Cardinals, which might not dwell there, as if he were rightfull Patron of thoſe Benefices; whereas by the Law of <hi>England</hi> he never had right to the Patronage thereof; whereby in ſhort time all the Spirituall promotions in the Realm would be ingroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into the hands of Strangers, Canonicall elections of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates would be aboliſhed, works of Charity would ceaſe, the founders and true patrons of Churches would be diſinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the King's Counſell would be weakened, the whole Kingdome impoveriſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Laws and rights of the Realm deſtroyed.

That the King and his Subjects ſhould thenceforth enjoy the rights of patronage; That free elections of Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and other Prelates elective, ſhould be made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ancient grants of the King's Progenitors and their founders; That no <hi>Bulls</hi> of <hi>Proviſion</hi> ſhould be put in execution, but that the <hi>Proviſors</hi> ſhould be attached, fined, and ranſomed at the King's will, and withall impriſoned till they had renounced the benefits of their <hi>Bulls,</hi> ſatisfied the partie grieved, and given ſureties not to commit the like offence again.</p>
               <p>Now, Maſter <hi>Lalor,</hi> what think you of theſe things? Did you believe that ſuch Laws as theſe had been made againſt the Pope 200, 250, 300 years ſince?

                  <note place="margin">Theſe Laws made by ſuch as did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Religion.</note> Were they good Catholicks? or good Subjects? or what were they? You will not ſay they were Proteſtants, for you will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Reformed Religion to be ſo ancient as thoſe times: neither can you ſay they were undutifull, for they ſtrove to uphold their liege Lord's Sovereignty. Doubtleſs the people in thoſe days did generally embrace the vulgar errours and ſuperſtitions of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, and in that reſpect were Papiſts as well as you: but they had not learned the new doctrine of the Pope's Supremacie, and tranſcendent autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over Kings; they did not believe he had power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Princes, and diſcharge Subjects of their allegeance, to abrogate the fundamentall Laws of Kingdomes, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his Canons as binding laws upon all nations, without their conſents: they thought it a good point of Religion to be good Subjects, to honour their King, to love their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and to maintain the laws and liberties thereof, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in other points they did erre and were miſs-led with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>The firſt encroachment of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> upon the liberties of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> was made in the time of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57830:15"/>
King <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conqueror.</hi> For before that time the Pope's Writ did not run in <hi>England,</hi> his <hi>Bulls</hi> of <hi>Excommunication</hi> and <hi>Proviſion</hi> came not thither, no <hi>Citation,</hi> no <hi>Appeals</hi> were made from thence to the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> Our Archbiſhops did not purchaſe their Palls there,<note place="margin">A compariſon of the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Monarchy of the Church with the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies of the world.</note> neither had the Pope the <hi>Inveſtiture</hi> of any of our Biſhopricks. For it is to be obſerved, that as under the Temporal Monarchy of <hi>Rome Britany</hi> was one of the laſt Provinces that was wone, and one of the firſt that was loſt again: ſo under the Spiritual Monarchy of the Pope of <hi>Rome England</hi> was one of the laſt Countries of Chriſtendom that received his yoke, and was again one of the firſt that did reject and caſt it off. And truly, as in this, ſo in divers other points, the courſe of this Spiritual Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of the Pope may be aptly compared with the courſe of the Temporal Monarchies of the world. For as the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Monarchies were firſt raiſed by intruſion upon other Princes and Commonweals; ſo did this Spiritual Prince (as they now ſtyle him) grow to his greatneſs by uſurping upon other States and Churches. As the Temporal Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, following the courſe of the Sun, did riſe in the Eaſt, and ſettle in the Weſt; ſo did the Hierarchy or govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church. Of the four Temporal Monarchies the firſt two were in <hi>Aſia,</hi> the latter two in <hi>Europe</hi>; but the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Monarchy did ſurpaſs and ſuppreſs them all: So were there four great Patriarchs, or Eccleſiaſtical Hierarchies, two in the Eaſt, and two in the Weſt; but the <hi>Roman</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch exalted himſelf, and uſurped a Supremacy above them all. And as the riſing of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was moſt oppoſed by the State of <hi>Carthage</hi> in <hi>Africa, (aemula Romae Carthago</hi>;) ſo the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> and the <hi>African</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops did firſt forbid Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> and oppoſed the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy of the Pope. And doth not <hi>Daniel's</hi> Image, whoſe head was of gold, and legs and feet of iron and clay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent this Spiritual Monarchy as well as the Temporal, whereas the firſt Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were golden Prieſts, though they had but wooden Chalices, and that the Popes of later times have been for the moſt part worldly and earthly-minded? And as the Northern Nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57830:15"/>
from the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, and at laſt brake it in pieces; have not the North and North-weſt Nations firſt fallen away from the Papacy? and are they not like in the end to bring it to ruine?</p>
               <p>But to return to our purpoſe;<note place="margin">The Pope had no juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in England in the time of the Britans.</note> The Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt had no juriſdiction in the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> neither in the time of the <hi>Britans,</hi> nor in the time of the <hi>Saxons.

               <p>After that, about the year 600, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Monk was ſent by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great into <hi>England</hi> to convert the <hi>Saxons</hi> to Chriſtian Religion; the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Biſhops then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in <hi>Wales</hi> regarded not his Commiſſion nor his doctrine, as not owing any duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor having any depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency on the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> but ſtill retained their ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and traditions which they received from the Eaſt Church upon the firſt plantation of the Faith in that Iſland, being divers and contrary to thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did endeavour to impoſe upon them.</p>

They made alſo ſeveral Laws for the government of the Church: Among others Saint <hi>Edward</hi> begins his Laws with this proteſtation, that it is his Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charge, <hi>ut populum Domini, &amp; ſuper omnia ſanctam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, regat &amp; gubernet.</hi> Aud King <hi>Edgar,</hi> in his Oration to his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy, <hi>Ego</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Conſtantinis vos Petri gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium habetis: jungamus dextras, &amp; gladium, gladio copulemus, ut ejiciantur extra caſtra leproſi, &amp; purgetur ſanctuarium Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini.</hi> So as the Kings of <hi>England</hi> with their own Clergy did govern the Church, and therein ſought no aid of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> And the troth is, that though the Pope had then long hands, yet he did not extend them ſo far as <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> becauſe they were full of buſineſs nearer home in drawing the Emperour and the <hi>French</hi> King under his yoke. But upon the Conqueſt made by the <hi>Norman,</hi> he apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57830:16"/>
the firſt occaſion to uſurp upon the Liberties of the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The firſt uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Pope upon the Crown began in the time of King William the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> For the <hi>Conquerour</hi> came in with the Pope's Banner, and under it wone the battel which got him the garland: and therefore the Pope preſumed he might boldly pluck ſome flowers from it, being partly gained by his countenance and bleſſing. Hereupon he ſent two Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates into <hi>England,</hi> which were admitted and received by the <hi>Conquerour.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">By ſending Legates into England.</note> With them he called a Synod of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and depoſed old <hi>Stigand</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had not purchaſed his Pall in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>; he diſplaced many Biſhops and Abbots to place his <hi>Normans</hi> in their rooms. And amongſt the reſt it is to be noted, that the King having earneſtly moved <hi>Wolſtan</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> being then very aged, to give up his Staff, his anſwer was, that he would give up his Staff onely to him of whom he firſt received the ſame. And ſo the old man went to Saint <hi>Edward</hi>'s Tomb, and there offered up his Staff and Ring, with theſe words, <hi>Of thee, O holy Edward, I received my Staff and my Ring, and to thee I do now ſurrender the ſame again.</hi> Which proves, that before the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt the King did inveſt his Biſhops <hi>per annulum &amp; baculum,</hi> as I ſaid before.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, by the admiſſion of the Pope's Legates, the firſt ſtep or entry made into his uſurped juriſdiction in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Albeit the King ſtill retained the abſolute power of inveſting Biſhops, and ſeemed onely to uſe the advice and aſſiſtance of the Legates in Eccleſiaſtical matters; for that no Decree paſſed or was put in execution without his Royal aſſent thereunto.

               <p>But to return to the cauſe of his great quarrell with the Pope. The See of <hi>Canterbury</hi> being void, the Monks of <hi>Canterbury</hi> ſuddenly and ſecretly without the King's licence elected one <hi>Reignold</hi> their Subprior to be Archbiſhop, who immediately poſted away to be confirmed by the Pope. But when he came there, the Pope rejected him, becauſe he came not recommended from the King. Hereupon the Monks made ſuit to the King to nominate ſome fit perſon to whoſe election they might proceed. The King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, <hi>John Gray</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> his principall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57830:21"/>
who was afterward Lord Juſtice of this Kingdome, who with a full conſent was elected by them, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards admitted and fully inveſted by the King. Theſe two elections bred ſuch a controverſie as none might determine but the Pope, who gave a ſhort rule in the caſe, for he pronounced both elections void, and cauſed ſome of the Monks of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who were then preſent in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to proceed to the election of <hi>Stephen Langton,</hi> late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made Cardinal at the motion and ſuit of the <hi>French</hi> King: who being ſo elected was forthwith confirmed and conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Pope, and recommended to the King of <hi>England</hi> with a flattering Letter, and a preſent of four Rings ſet with precious ſtones,<note place="margin">King John's round and Kingly Letter to the Pope.</note> which were of great value and eſtimation in thoſe days. Howbeit the King more eſteeming this Jewell of the Crown, namely, the Patronage of Biſhopricks, returned a round and Kingly anſwer to the Pope, That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderately and raſhly he had caſſed and made void the election of the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and had cauſed one <hi>Langton,</hi> a man to him unknown, and bred up and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed amongſt his mortal enemies, to be conſecrated Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, without any due form of election, and without his Royal aſſent, which was moſt of all requiſite by the ancient laws and cuſtomes of his Realm. That he marvelled much, that the Pope himſelf and the whole Court of <hi>Rome</hi> did not conſider what a precious account they ought to make of the King of <hi>England</hi>'s friendſhip, in regard that his one Kingdome did yield them more profit and revenue then all the other countries on this ſide the <hi>Alpes.</hi> To conclude, he would maintain the liberties of his Crown to the death, he would reſtrain all his ſubjects from going to <hi>Rome.</hi> And ſince the Archbiſhops, Biſhops and other Prelates within his dominions were as learned and religious as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Chriſtendome, his ſubjects ſhould be judged by them in Eccleſiaſticall matters, and ſhould not need to run out of their own country <hi>to beg Juſtice at the hands of ſtrangers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what followed upon this? The Pope, after a ſharp reply, ſendeth forth a Bull of Malediction againſt the King,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57830:21"/>
and of Interdiction againſt the Realm,<note place="margin">The Pope curſeth the King, and interdicteth the Realm.</note> whereby all the Churches in <hi>England</hi> were ſhut up, the Prieſts and Religious perſons were forbidden to uſe any Liturgies or Divine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to marry, to bury, or to perform any Chriſtian duty among the people. This put the King into ſuch a rage, that he on the other part ſeized the Temporalties of all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Abbots, and confiſcated the goods of all the Clergie. Then doth the Pope by a ſolemn ſentence at <hi>Rome</hi> depoſe the King, and by a Bull ſent into <hi>England</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth his ſubjects of their allegeance, and by a Legate ſent to the King of <hi>France</hi> gave the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> to him and his ſucceſſours for ever.</p>
               <p>Theſe things brought ſuch confuſion and miſerie to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates and degrees of people in <hi>England,</hi> as the King became odious to all his ſubjects, as well to the Laietie as to the Clergie. For as the Biſhops and religious people curſed him abroad, ſo the Barons took arms againſt him at home, till with much bloudſhed they forced him, by granting the <hi>Great Charter,</hi> to reſtore King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws containing the ancient Liberties of the ſubjects of <hi>England.</hi> The Pope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſpectator of this Tragedy, and ſeeing the King in ſo weak and deſperate eſtate, ſent a Legate to comfort him, and to make a reaſonable motion unto him; to wit, that he ſhould ſurrender and give up his Crown and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the Pope, which ſhould be re-granted unto him again to hold in Fee-farm and Vaſſalage of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> And that thereupon the Pope would bleſſe him and his Realm again, and curſe his rebells and enemies in ſuch ſort, as he ſhould be better eſtabliſht in his Kingdome then he was before. In a word, this motion was preſently em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by that miſerable King, ſo as with his own hands he gave up the Crown to the Pope's Legat, and by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument or Charter ſealed with a Bull or Seal of gold he granted to God and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third and his ſucceſſours, the whole Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and the whole Kingdome of <hi>Ireland</hi>; and took back an eſtate thereof by an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſealed with Lead, yielding yearly to the Church of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57830:22"/>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> over and above the <hi>Peter-pence</hi> a thouſand marks ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>viz.</hi> ſeven hundred marks for <hi>England,</hi> and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred marks for <hi>Ireland,</hi> with a flattering ſaving of all his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Royalties. The Pope had no ſooner gotten this conveiance, though it were void in law, but he excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth the Barons, and repeals the <hi>Great Charter,</hi> affirming that it contained liberties too great for his ſubjects; calls the King his Vaſſall, and theſe Kingdomes <hi>Saint Peter's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony</hi>; grants a general Bull of Proviſion for the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all Eccleſiaſticall Benefices, and takes upon him to be abſolute and immediate Lord of all. And thus, under colour of exerciſing Juriſdiction within theſe Kingdomes, the Pope by degrees got the very Kingdomes themſelves. And ſo would he doe at this day, if the King would give way to his Juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>But what uſe did the Pope make of this grant and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of the Crown unto him? what did he gain by it, if our Kings retained the profits of their Kingdomes to their own uſe? Indeed we do not find that the Fee-farm of a thouſand marks was ever pay'd, but that it is all run in arrear till this preſent day. For the troth is, the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> did ſcorn to accept ſo poor a revenue as a thouſand marks <hi>per annum</hi> out of two Kingdomes. But after the death of King <hi>John,</hi> during all the reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. his ſon, the Pope did not claim a Seignioury or a Rent out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but did endeavour to convert all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of both Lands to his own uſe, as if he had been ſeized of all in demeſne. For whoſoever will reade <hi>Matth. Paris</hi> his ſtory of the time of King <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. will ſay theſe things ſpoken of before were but the <hi>beginnings of evils.</hi> For the exactions and oppreſſions of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> were ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall and intolerable, as that poor Monk, who lived in thoſe times, though otherwiſe he adored the Pope, doth call <hi>England Baalam</hi>'s <hi>Aſſe</hi> loaden, beaten, and enforced to ſpeak; doth call the Court of <hi>Rome Charybdis</hi> and <hi>bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrum avaritiae,</hi> the Pope's Collectors <hi>Harpyes,</hi> and the Pope himſelf a <hi>Stepfather,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> a <hi>Stepmother.</hi> He ſheweth that two third parts of the Land being then
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57830:22"/>
in the hands of Church-men, the entire profits thereof were exported to enrich the Pope and the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> which was done for the moſt part by theſe two ways and means. Firſt, by conferring the beſt Eccleſiaſticall Benefices upon <hi>Italians,</hi> and other Strangers reſident in that Court, whoſe farmers and factors in <hi>England</hi> took the profits, turned them into money, and returned the money to <hi>Rome.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by impoſing continuall taxes and tallages, (worſe then <hi>Iriſh cuttings</hi>) being ſometimes the tenth, ſometimes the fifteenth, ſometimes the third, ſometimes the moietie of all the goods both of the Clergie and Laietie, under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of maintaining the Pope's holy wars againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and the Greek Church, who were then ſaid to be in rebellion againſt their Lady and miſtreſſe the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Beſides, for the ſpeedy levying and ſafe return of theſe moneys, the Pope had his <hi>Lombards</hi> and other <hi>Italian</hi> Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers and Uſurers reſident in <hi>London</hi> and other parts of the Realm, who offered to lend and disburſe the moneys taxed, and return the ſame by exchange to <hi>Rome,</hi> taking ſuch penal Bands, the form whereof is ſet down in <hi>Matth. Paris,</hi> and ſuch exceſſive Uſury, as the poor Religious houſes ware fain to ſell their Chalices and Copes, and the reſt of the Clergie and Laiety had their backs bowed and their eſtates broken under the burthen. Beſides, the Pope took for perquiſites and caſualties the goods of all Clerks that died inteſtate, the goods of all Uſurers, and all goods given to charitable uſes. Moreover he had a ſwarm of Friers, (the firſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters of Religion in <hi>England</hi>) who perſwaded the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Gentrie to put on the ſign of the Croſſe, and to vow themſelves to the Holy wars, which they had no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner done, but they were again perſwaded to receive diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of their vows, and to give mony for the ſame to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I omit divers other policies then uſed by the Pope's Collectors to exhauſt the wealth of the Realm, which they affirmed they might take with as good a conſcience as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> took the Jewells of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</hi> Briefly, whereas the King had ſcarce means to maintain his Royall family, they received out of <hi>England</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:57830:23"/>
ſeventy thouſand pounds ſterling at leaſt yearly, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth to two hundred and ten thouſand pounds ſterling of the moneys currant at this day. Beſides, they exported ſix thouſand marks out of <hi>Ireland</hi> at one time, which the Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> intercepted. Laſtly, the King himſelf was ſo much dejected, as at a Royal Feaſt be placed the Pope's Legate in his own Chair of State, himſelf ſitting on his right hand, and the Biſhop of <hi>York</hi> on his left, <hi>non ſine multorum obliquantibus oculis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Matth. Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we ſee the effect of the Pope's pretended Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on within the dominions of the King of <hi>England.</hi> We ſee to what calamity and ſervitude it then reduced both the Prince and people. Was it not therefore high time to meet and oppoſe thoſe inconveniences? Aſſuredly if King <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. who was the Son and heir of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. had inherited the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Father, and had not reſiſted this Uſurpation and inſolencie of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope had been propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etor of both theſe Ilands, and there had been no King of <hi>England</hi> at this day.<note place="margin">King Edw. 1. opp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But King <hi>Edward</hi> 1. may well be ſtyled <hi>vindex Anglicae li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertatis,</hi> the <hi>Moſes</hi> that delivered his people from ſlavery and oppreſſion: and as he was a brave and victorious Prince, ſo was he the beſt <hi>Pater patriae</hi> that ever reigned in <hi>England</hi> ſince the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt, till the Coronation of our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sovereign. At the time of the death of his father he was abſent in the war of the Holy land, being a principal Commander of the Chriſtian Armie there, ſo as he returned not before the ſecond year of his reign. But he was no ſooner returned and crowned, but the firſt work he did was to ſhake off the yoke of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> For the Pope having then ſummoned a generall Council, before he would licence his Biſhops to repair unto it, he took of them a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn oath, that they ſhould not receive the Pope's bleſſing. Again, the Pope forbids the King to war againſt <hi>Scotland</hi>; the King regards not his prohibition: he demands the Firſt-fruits of Eccleſiaſticall Livings; the King forbids the payment thereof unto him. The Pope ſendeth forth a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Bull prohibiting the Clergie to pay ſubſidies or tributes
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57830:23"/>
to Temporal Princes. A Tenth was granted to the King in Parliament, the Clergie refuſed to pay it: the King ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth their Temporalties for their contempt, and got pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment notwithſtanding the Pope's Bull. After this he made the Statute of <hi>Mortmain,</hi> whereby he brake the Pope's chief net, which within an Age or two more would have drawn to the Church all the temporall poſſeſſions of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Again, one of the King's ſubjects brought a Bull of Excommunication againſt another; the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth he ſhould be executed as a traitour, according to the ancient Law. But becauſe that Law had not of long time been put in execution, the Chancellour and Treaſurer kneeled before the King, and obtained grace for him, ſo as he was onely baniſhed out of the Realm. And as he judged it treaſon to bring in Bulls of Excommunication; ſo he held it a high contempt againſt the Crown to bring in Bulls of Proviſion, or Briefs of Citation, and accordingly the Law was ſo declared in Parliament 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. which was the firſt Statute made againſt <hi>Proviſors:</hi> the execution of which Law, during the life of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. did well-nigh aboliſh the uſurped Juriſdiction of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive and reſtore again the ancient and abſolute Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the King and Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Succeſſour K. <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. being but a weak Prince,<note place="margin">E. 2. ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Pope to uſurp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</note> the Pope attempted to uſurp upon him again: but the Peers and people withſtood his Uſurpation. And when that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy King was to be depoſed, amongſt many Articles fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againſt him by his enemies, this was one of the moſt hainous, that he had given allowance to the Bope's Bulls.</p>
               <p>Again, during the minority of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and after that in the heat of the wars in <hi>France,</hi> the Pope ſent many Briefs and Bulls into <hi>England</hi>; and at laſt preſumed ſo far, as that he gave an <hi>Italian</hi> the title of a Cardinall in <hi>England,</hi> and withall by his Bull gave him power to beſtow all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall promotions as they ſhould fall void from time to time. This moved the King and the Nobility to write to the Pope to this effect: <q>We and our anceſtours have rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endowed the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and have founded Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57830:24"/>
and other Religious houſes for the juriſdiction of our people,<note place="margin">E. 3. reſiſteth the Vſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pope.</note> for maintenance of hoſpitalitie, and for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of our countrymen and kinſmen. Now you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and place ſtrangers in our Benefices, that come not to keep reſidence thereupon; and if they come, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not our language; and ſome of them are ſubjects to our mortal enemies: by reaſon whereof our people are not inſtructed, hoſpitalitie is not kept, our Scholars are unpreferred, and the Treaſure of the Realm is expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</q> The Pope returneth anſwer, That the Emperour had lately ſubmitted himſelf to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in all points, and was become the Pope's great friend; and in menacing manner adviſed the King of <hi>England</hi> to doe the like. The King replies, That if the Emperour and <hi>French</hi> King both ſhould take his part, he was ready to give bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell to both in defence of the liberties of his Crown. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the ſeverall Statutes againſt <hi>Proviſors</hi> before recited were put in execution ſo ſeverely, as the King and his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects enjoyed their right of patronage clearly: and their exemption of Clerks took no place at all; for that the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of <hi>Waltham</hi> and Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> were both attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of high contempts, and the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> of a capital of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as appeareth in the Records of this King's reign.<note place="margin">King Rich. 2.</note> Yet during the nonage of <hi>Richard</hi> 2. they began once again to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach upon the Crown, by ſending Legates and Bulls and Briefs into <hi>England</hi>; whereof the people were ſo ſenſible and impatient, as that at their ſpecial prayer this Law of 16 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. (whereupon our Indictment is framed) was enacted, being more ſharp and penall then all the former Statutes againſt <hi>Proviſors.</hi> And yet againſt this King, as againſt <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. it was objected at the time of his Deprivation, that he had allowed the Pope's Bulls to the enthralling of the Crown.</p>
               <p>After this in the weak time of King <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. they made one attempt more to revive their uſurped Juriſdiction by this policy: The Commons had denied the King a Subſidy when he ſtood in great want of moneys. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and the reſt of the Biſhops<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> offered the King a large ſupply of his wants if he would conſent that all the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57830:24"/>
Laws againſt <hi>Proviſors,</hi> and ſpecially this Law of 16 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. might be repealed. But <hi>Humphrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> who had lately before caſt the Pope's Bull into the fire, did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe cauſe this motion to be rejected. So as by ſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence theſe Laws have ſtood in force even till this day in both theſe Kingdomes.</p>
               <p>Then the Atturney generall deſcended to the evidence,<note place="margin">The Evidence againſt Lalor.</note> whereby he proved fully all the parts of the Indictment. Firſt, it was proved by <hi>Lalor</hi>'s own Confeſſion, upon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Examinations taken before the Lord Deputie and Lord Chancellor and others, that he had accepted the Office and title of Vicar-general in the Dioceſes of <hi>Dublin, Kildare</hi> and <hi>Fernes,</hi> by virtue of the Pope's Bull. Secondly, it appeared by the copies of ſundry Letters found among his papers at his apprehenſion, that he ſtyled himſelf the Pope's Vicar, in this form, <hi>Robertus Dublinien. &amp; Kildaren. &amp; Fernen. Dioeceſ. Vicarius Apoſtolicus.</hi> Thirdly, there were produced the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of divers Acts and Inſtruments, written for the moſt part with <hi>Lalor</hi>'s own hand, ſome of Inſtitutions of Popiſh Prieſts to Benefices, others of Diſpenſations with Marriage within the degrees, others of Divorces, others of Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for non-payment of Tithes. Whereby it was manifeſtly proved that he did execute the Pope's Bull, in uſurping and exerciſing Epiſcopall juriſdiction as <hi>Vicar-generall</hi> of the See Apoſtolick within the Dioceſes before named.</p>
               <p>To this evidence he made a threefold anſwer. Firſt, That he was no ſuiter for the office of <hi>Vicar-generall,</hi> but it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on him, and he accepted <hi>virtute obedientiae,</hi> onely to obey his Superiours. Next, That he did exerciſe the office of <hi>Vicar-generall in foro conſcientiae tantum,</hi> and not <hi>in foro ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicii.</hi> And laſtly, that thoſe copies of Inſtitutions, Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations and Divorces were many of them written with his man's hand, as precedents of ſuch Acts and Inſtruments, without his privity or direction. Hereupon Sir <hi>James Ley</hi> Chief Juſtice told him, that—he could not well ſay that he accepted that unlawfull office <hi>virtute obedientiae,</hi> for there was no vertue in that obedience: That he ow'd an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law, and to the King, who is the true Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57830:25"/>
and Sovereign over all his ſubjects, and hath no Peer within his dominions; and that the Superiours whom he meant and intended were but Uſurpers upon the King's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and therefore this excuſe did aggravate his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, in that it appeared he had vowed obedience to thoſe who were apparent enemies to the King and his Crown. And though it were manifeſt that he exerciſed ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction <hi>in foro judicii,</hi> (for every Inſtitution is a Judgement, and ſo is every Sentence of divorce:) yet were his offence nothing diminiſhed if he had executed his office of <hi>Vicar-generall in foro conſcientiae tantum</hi>; for the court of man's conſcience is the higheſt tribunall, and wherein the power of the Keys is exerciſed in the higheſt degree.</p>
               <p>Hereunto the Atturney generall took occaſion to adde thus much, That <hi>Lalor</hi> had committed theſe high offences, not onely againſt the Law, but againſt his own Conſcience, and that he was already condemned <hi>in foro conſcientiae.</hi> For that he upon his ſecond Examination had voluntarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged himſelf not to be a lawfull <hi>Vicar-generall,</hi> and that he thought in his conſcience he could not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully take upon him the ſaid office. He hath alſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged our Sovereign Lord K. <hi>James</hi> to be his lawfull, Chief and Supreme Governour, in all cauſes, as well Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall as Civile; and that he is in conſcience bound to obey him in all the ſaid cauſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it is contained in his Acknowledgement or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion before ſet down. Which being ſhewed forth by the Atturney generall,<note place="margin">Lalor's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly read.</note> the Court cauſed it to be publickly read; and thereupon demanded of <hi>Lalor,</hi> if that were not his free and voluntary confeſſion ſigned with his own hand, and confirmed by his oath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord Deputie and Councill. He was not a little abaſhed at the publiſhing of this Acknowledgement and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in the hearing of ſo many principal Gentlemen, to whom he had preached a contrary doctrine: therefore, ſaid he, the ſhewing forth of this Confeſſion is altogether imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent and beſides the matter. Howſoever he could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but that he made it, and ſigned it, and ſwore it, as it was teſtified by the Lord Deputie and the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:57830:25"/>Then was it demanded of him, whether ſince the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this Confeſſion he had not proteſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>This is a ſubtile evaſion indeed, ſaid the Atturney gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: I pray you what difference do you make between <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall cauſes</hi> and <hi>Spirituall cauſes?</hi> This queſtion, ſaid <hi>Lalor,</hi> is ſudden and unexpected at this time, and therefore you ſhall doe well to take another day to diſpute this point. Nay, ſaid the Atturney generall, we can never ſpeak of it in a better time or fitter place: and therefore though you, that bear ſo reverend a title, and hold the reputation of ſo great a Clerk, require a farther time; yet ſhall you hear that we Lay-men that ſerve his Majeſtie, and by the dutie of our places are to maintain the Juriſdiction of the Crown, are never ſo unprovided but that we can ſay ſomewhat touching the nature and difference of theſe Cauſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt then,<note place="margin">When the diſtinction of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call &amp; Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall cauſes from Civil and Temporal cauſes began in the world.</note> let us ſee when this diſtinction of <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> or <hi>Spirituall cauſes</hi> from <hi>Civile</hi> and <hi>Temporall cauſes</hi> did firſt begin in point of juriſdiction. Aſſuredly for the ſpace of three hundred years after <hi>Chriſt</hi> this diſtinction was not known or heard of in the Chriſtian world.

                     </gap>uſes,</hi> were meerly <hi>Civil,</hi> and determined by the rules of the Civil Law, and ſubject onely to the juriſdiction of the Civil Magiſtrate, as all Civilians will teſtifie with me.</p>
               <p>But after that the Emperours had received the Chriſtian Faith, out of a zeal and deſire they had to grace and honour the learned and godly Biſhops of that time, they were pleaſed to ſingle out certain ſpeciall Cauſes wherein they granted juriſdiction unto the Biſhops: namely, in cauſes of <hi>Tithes,</hi> becauſe they were paid to men of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57830:26"/>
Church; in cauſes of <hi>Matrimony,</hi> becauſe Marriages were for the moſt part ſolemnized in the Church; in cauſes <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary,</hi> becauſe Teſtaments were many times made <hi>in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremis,</hi> when Church-men were preſent, giving ſpiritual comfort to the Teſtator, and therefore they were thought the fitteſt perſons to take the probates of ſuch Teſtaments. Howbeit theſe Biſhops did not proceed in theſe cauſes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Canons and Decrees of the Church, (for the Canon Law was not then hatched or dream'd of) but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules of the Imperiall Law, as the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate did proceed in other cauſes: neither did the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, in giving this Juriſdiction unto them, give away their own Supreme and abſolute power, to correct and puniſh theſe Judges as well as others, if they performed not their ſeverall duties. This then is moſt certain, that the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Juriſdiction in all theſe cauſes was in the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and ſo in right it remaineth at this day; and though it be derived from him, it remaineth in him as in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. For every Chriſtian Monarch (as well as the godly Kings of <hi>Juda</hi>) is <hi>cuſtos utriuſque Tabulae</hi>; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath power to puniſh not onely Treaſon, Murther, Theft, and all manner of Force and Fraud; but Inceſt, Adultery, Uſury, Perjury, Simony, Sorcery, Idolatry, Blaſphemy. Neither are theſe Cauſes in reſpect of their own quality and nature to be diſtinguiſhed one from another by the names of <hi>Spirituall</hi> or <hi>Temporall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> For why is <hi>Adultery</hi> a <hi>Spirituall cauſe</hi> rather then <hi>Murther,</hi> when they are both offences alike a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Second Table? or <hi>Idolatry</hi> rather then <hi>Perjury,</hi> being both offences likewiſe againſt the Firſt Table? And indeed if we conſider the natures of theſe Cauſes, it will ſeem ſomewhat abſurd that they are diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>Spirituall</hi> and <hi>Temporall:</hi> for, to ſpeak properly, that which is oppoſed to <hi>Spirituall</hi> ſhould be termed <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>; and that which is oppoſed to <hi>Temporall</hi> ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Eternall.</hi> And therefore if things were called by their proper names, <hi>Adultery</hi> ſhould not be called a <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall</hi> offence, but a <hi>carnall.</hi> But ſhall I expreſſe plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and briefly why theſe Cauſes were firſt denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57830:26"/>
ſome <hi>Spirituall</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> and others <hi>Temporall</hi> and <hi>Civil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truly they were ſo called, not from the nature of the Cauſes, as I ſaid before, but from the quality of the perſons whom the Prince had made Judges in thoſe Cauſes. The Clergie did ſtudy <hi>ſpirituall</hi> things, and did profeſſe to live <hi>ſecundum ſpiritum,</hi> and were called <hi>ſpirituall men</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they called the Cauſes wherein Princes had given them juriſdiction <hi>ſpirituall cauſes,</hi> after their own name and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. But becauſe the Lay-magiſtrates were ſaid to intend the things of this world, which are <hi>temporall</hi> and tranſitory, the Clergie called them <hi>ſecular</hi> or <hi>temporall</hi> men, and the Cauſes wherein they were Judges <hi>temporall cauſes.</hi> This diſtinction began firſt in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Clergie having by this Juriſdiction gotten great wealth, their wealth begot pride, their pride begot ingratitude towards Princes, who firſt gave them their Juriſdiction, and then, according to the nature of all ungratefull perſons, they went about to extinguiſh the memory of the benefit: for whereas their Juriſdiction was firſt derived from <hi>Caeſar,</hi> in the execution whereof they were <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Judges, ſo as both their Courts and Cauſes ought ſtill to have born <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>'s <hi>image</hi> and <hi>ſuperſcription,</hi> as belonging unto <hi>Caeſar</hi>; they blotted <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s name out of the ſtyle of their Courts, and called them <hi>Courts Chriſtian,</hi> as if the Courts holden by other Magiſtrates had been in compariſon but Courts of <hi>Ethnicks</hi>; and the Cauſes which in their nature were meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Civil,</hi> they called <hi>Spirituall</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſticall.</hi> So as if the Emperour ſhould challenge his Courts and Cauſes again, and ſay, <hi>Reddite Caeſariquae ſunt Caeſaris,</hi> they would all cry out on the contrary part and ſay, <hi>Date Deo quae ſunt Dei</hi>; our Courts bear the name and title of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the ſuperſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Caeſar</hi> is quite worn out, and not to be found upon them. And this point of their policy is worth the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that when they found their juriſdiction in Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall cauſes to be the moſt ſweet and gainfull of all other, (for of <hi>Matrimony</hi> they made <hi>matter of money</hi> indeed) to the end that <hi>Caeſar</hi> might never reſume ſo rich a perquiſite of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57830:27"/>
their Spirituall juriſdiction, they reduced Matrimony into the number of the 7 <hi>Sacraments:</hi> after which time it had been Sacriledge, if the Civil Magiſtrate had intermeddled with the leaſt matter that had relation to Matrimonie, or any dependencie thereupon. So then it appeareth, that all Cauſes whereof Eccleſiaſticall or Spirituall perſons have cogniſance or juriſdiction by the grants or permiſſion of Princes are called <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> or <hi>Spirituall cauſes.</hi> And as all their Courts are called <hi>Spirituall Courts,</hi> ſo all Cauſes determinable in thoſe Courts are called <hi>Spirituall Cauſes.</hi> And therefore where Mr. <hi>Lalor</hi> hath acknowledged the King's Majeſtie to be Supreme Governour in all <hi>Eccleſiaſticall cauſes,</hi> he hath therein acknowledged the King's Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in all <hi>Spirituall cauſes</hi>; wherein he hath but rendered to <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which is <hi>Caeſar's,</hi> and hath given unto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie no more then all the Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> have yielded to his Predeceſſours, not onely in this latter Age, but alſo in former times both before and ſince the Conqueſt, as hath been before at large expreſſed.</p>
               <p>Here the day being far ſpent, the Court demanded of the priſoner if he had any more to ſay for himſelf. His anſwer was, That he did willingly renounce his office of <hi>Vicar-generall,</hi> and did humbly crave his Majeſtie's grace and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. And to that end, he deſired the Court to move the L. Deputy to be favourable unto him. Then the Jury de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Bar, and returning within half an hour, found the priſoner guiltie of the Contempts whereof he was indicted. Whereupon the Solicitor generall moved the Court to proceed to Judgement. And Sir <hi>Dominick Sarſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> Knight, one of the Juſtices of his Majeſtie's chief place, gave Judgement according to the form of the Statute whereupon the Indictment was framed.</p>

The Defendant pleaded not guilty, and the Jury returned and ſworn for triall of this iſſue gave a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Verdict; that is, they found the truth of the Caſe at large, referring the ſame for the Law to the judgment of the Court, to this effect: They found that the Plaintif before the Treſpaſſe ſuppoſed to be done was Parſon of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of <hi>South-Luffenham,</hi> in the County aforeſaid, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the place wherein the Treſpaſs is alledged was

parcell; and found the Statute made in the firſt year of the ſaid Queen's Reign, by which in effect it is enacted, That ſuch Juriſdiction Eccleſiaſticall as by any Spirituall or Eccleſiaſticall power hath heretofore been, or may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be, exerciſed for the Viſitation of the Eccleſiaſticall eſtate and perſons, and for reformation, order and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the ſame, and of all manner of Errors, Hereſies, Schiſms, Abuſes, Offences, Contempts and Enormities with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Realm, ſhould for ever be united and annexed to the Imperiall Crown of this Realm: And that her Highneſſe, her Heirs and Succeſſors, ſhould have full power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by virtue of that Act, by Letters Patents under the great Seal of <hi>England</hi> to aſſign, nominate and authorize ſuch perſons, being natural-born Subjects, as her Highneſs, her Heirs or Succeſſors ſhould think meet, to exerciſe and execute under her Highneſſe, her Heirs and Succeſſors, all and all manner of Juriſdiction, Priviledges and Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences, in any wiſe touching or concerning any Spiritual or Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction within this Realm of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>; and to viſit, reform, redreſſe, order, correct and amend all ſuch Errors, Hereſies, Schiſms, Abuſes, Offences, Contempts and Enormities whatſoever, which by any manner of Spiritual or Eccleſiaſtical power, authority or juriſdiction, can or may lawfully be reformed, ordered, redreſſed, corrected, reſtrained or amended, to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Almighty God, the encreaſe of vertue, and the conſervation of the peace and unity of this Realm: And that ſuch perſons, ſo to be named, aſſigned and authorized, ſhould have full power and authority by virtue of that Act, and of ſuch Letters Patents, under her Highneſſe, her Heirs and Succeſſors, to exerciſe, uſe and execute all the premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, according to the tenour and effect of the ſaid Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, any matter or cauſe to the contrary notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p>And afterwards the ſaid Queen by her Letters Patents under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> bearing date the ninth day of <hi>December,</hi> in the ſix and twentieth year of her Reign, according to the tenour of the ſaid Act, did authorize the

Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and divers others, or any three or more of them, to enquire, amongſt others, of the Statute of the firſt year of her Reign concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Book of Common Prayer; with this Clauſe alſo contained in the ſaid Letters Patents, <hi>videlicet,</hi> Alſo we give and grant full power and authority to reform, redreſſe, order, correct and amend in all places of this Realm all Errors, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, Schiſms, Abuſes, Contempts and Enormities Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall or Eccleſiaſticall whatſoever, which by any Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall or Eccleſiaſticall power, authority or juriſdiction, can or may lawfully be reformed, ordered, redreſſed, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, reſtrained or amended by Cenſure; Eccleſiaſticall, Deprivation, or otherwiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And upon proof thereof had, and the offences aforeſaid, or any of them, ſufficiently proved againſt any perſon or perſons, by Confeſſion, lawful witneſs, or by any due manner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That then you or three of you ſhall have full power and authority to order and award ſuch puniſhment to every ſuch offendor, by Fine, Impriſonment, Cenſure of the Church, or otherwiſe, or by all or any of the ſaid ways, and to take ſuch order for the redreſſe of the ſame, as by your wiſedomes and diſcretions ſhall be thought meer and convenient, as by the ſaid Letters Patents more at large appeareth.</p>
            <p>And further, they found the Statute of the firſt year of the Reign of the ſaid Queen, by which it is enacted, That the offendor againſt that Act concerning the Uniformity of Common Prayer, being thereof lawfully convicted, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of the Realm, by Verdict of twelve men, or by his Confeſſion, or by the notorious Evidence of the fact, ſhould forfeit for the firſt offence the value of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall living for one whole year, and ſhould ſuffer ſix months Impriſonment: for the ſecond offence, to be committed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch Conviction, he ſhould be deprived <hi>ipſo facto</hi> of all his Spiritual livings: and for the third offence, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted after two Convictions as is aforeſaid, he ſhould be deprived of all his Eccleſiaſticall livings, and be impriſoned during his life. And that the ſaid <hi>Robert Caudrey</hi> before the time of the treſpaſs ſuppoſed was deprived of his ſaid
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57830:29"/>
Benefice before the ſaid High Commiſſioners, as well for that he had preached againſt the ſaid Book of Common Prayer, as alſo for that he refuſed to celebrate Divine Service ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſaid Book, and ſhewed particularly wherein: Which ſaid Sentence of Deprivation was given by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>London, cum aſſenſu A.

            <p>And this Caſe was ſolemnly and oftentimes debated at Barre by the Counſel of either party, and at the Bench by the Judges; and after great and long deliberation and conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had with the reſt of the Judges, was in the Term of S. <hi>Hillary,</hi> in the 37. year of the ſaid Queen adjudged. And it was argued by the Counſel of the Plaintif,<note place="margin">The objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Counſell of the Plaintif.</note> that the ſaid Deprivation was void for 4 cauſes.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> The ſaid Book of Common Prayer being authorized and commanded to be obſerved by the ſaid Act of the firſt year of the Queen, upon the forfeitures and puniſhments therein compriſed, the offence of the Plaintif is againſt that Act; for that Act onely doth command the obſervation of the ſaid Book, and inflicteth puniſhments in ſeverall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees for depraving or not obſerving of the ſame: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, if the offence be againſt that Act, the Plaintif ought to have been proceeded withall and puniſhed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſame. And it was ſaid, that the ſaid Act was an Act of great moderation and equity, for the offendor for his firſt offence ſhould not be <hi>ipſo facto</hi> deprived, but ſhould onely loſe the profits of his Eccleſiaſticall livings for one year, and ſuffer Impriſonment for ſix months, to the end that ſuch as were froward might have a time to repent, and the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded a time to conſent. And ſuch care had the Act of the offendors in this behalf, as if they committed one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and then another, and after the ſecond many more; yet ſhould not the offendor be deprived for any of the latter offences, unleſs he had been firſt judicially convicted of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57830:29"/>
by verdict of 12 men, or by confeſſion, or notorious evidence of the fact: So as the ſecond offence, for which he muſt be deprived by the ſaid Act, muſt be done and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted after ſuch a judiciall and ſolemn Conviction and puniſhment, according to the ſaid Act: And then if ſuch an open puniſhment and infliction ſhould not give him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and open his heart to repent, then, upon a like Conviction, for a ſecond offence, to be committed after ſuch a Conviction, Deprivation ſhould follow. But in the caſe now in queſtion, <hi>Caudrey</hi> the Plaintif was deprived from his ſaid Parſonage of <hi>South-Luffenham</hi> for his ſaid firſt offence, being never convented or convicted for any ſuch offence before. And therefore it was concluded for this firſt point, That the ſaid High Commiſſioners had not purſued the form and order preſcribed by the ſaid Act; <hi>&amp; non obſervata forma, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fertur adnullatio Actus</hi>; and conſequently the Deprivation of the Plaintif is void, and therefore Judgement ought to be given for him. And it was ſaid by the Plaintif's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, by way of anticipation, That albeit there was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo in the ſame Act for Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and their Chancellors, Commiſſaries, Archdeacons, and other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries, having peculiar Juriſdiction; yet that did not give any ſtrength to the ſaid Deprivation, for two cauſes. Firſt, that the Commiſſioners by force of the ſaid Act of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and of the ſaid Letters Patents, are not within the ſaid Proviſo, but onely Archbiſhops and Biſhops, their Chancellors, Commiſſaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in reſpect of their ordinary Juriſdiction. 2. Admitting it ſhould extend to the ſaid High Commiſſioners, yet ought they to proceed according to the form and order of the ſaid Act, for an offence done againſt that Act.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it was objected by the Counſel of the Plaintif,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>2.</hi>
               </note> That <hi>Caudrey</hi> the Plaintif was not deprived either by the verdict of 12 men, or by confeſſion, or by the notorious evidence of the fact, but by default in reſpect he appeared not, being duely precognizated or warned; which caſe, as it was objected, was <hi>Caſus omiſſus, &amp; oblivioni datus,</hi> and not within the ſaid Act.</p>

                  <hi>3.</hi>
               </note>Thirdly, it was objected on the behalf of the Plaintif, That the ſaid Sentence given by the ſaid High Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners was utterly void, for that they or any 3 or more of them having authority by force of the ſaid Act, and of the ſaid Letters Patents under the great Seal, ought to joyn in the Sentence, and that one alone with the conſent of 2 or more of the other Commiſſioners cannot give a Sentence; for that every Commiſſioner hath equal authority, and by the ſaid Letters Patents three or more muſt give the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence with conſent of others: and ſuch a Judgement given by any Commiſſioners of Oyer and Terminer, or other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners or Judges of the Common Law, were utterly void and of none effect.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>4.</hi>
               </note>Fourthly, and laſtly, it was objected, That the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners were not nominated and appointed according to the ſaid Act; for the Juriſdiction and power given by the ſaid Act to the Crown, is, to name ſuch Commiſſioners as be natural-born Subjects, and it doth not appear by the ſaid ſpecial verdict that the ſaid Commiſſioners were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral-born ſubjects: And albeit the Judges as private men in their particular knowledge did know them to be natural-born ſubjects; yet they being Judges of record, ought onely to ſee with Judicial eyes, and to take knowledge of no more then doth appear to them within the Record; for upon that, and not upon private knowledge out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, they onely muſt give their Judgement, and upon that Record enter their Judgement alſo of record. And ſeeing that the ſaid Queen had, as it was ſaid by the Plaintif's Counſel, Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction by the ſaid Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by the ſame, power was given unto her to name Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſioners; ſhe of neceſſity muſt make her nomination according to the ſaid Act, having no other power, as was objected, but by the ſaid Act. And ſeeing it was not ſpecially found that they were natural-born ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, <hi>&amp; de non apparentibus &amp; non exiſtentibus eadem eſt ratio</hi>; for this cauſe alſo the ſaid Sentence of Deprivation was void, as given by Commiſſioners not warranted by the ſaid Act.</p>
            <p>Asto the firſt and ſecond Objections, both being groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57830:30"/>
upon the ſaid Act of Parliament,<note place="margin">The reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Court to the <hi>1.</hi> and <hi>2.</hi>
               </note> it was reſolved by the whole Court, that notwithſtanding theſe two Objections, the Sentence was not to be impeached for either of them, and that for three cauſes. Firſt, for that the ſaid Act concerning the Uniformity of Common Prayer being in the affirmative, doth not abrogate or take away the Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Eccleſiaſticall, unleſs words in the negative had been added, as, <hi>and not otherwiſe,</hi> or <hi>in no other manner or form,</hi> or to the like effect. And this appeareth by the general rule of all our Books, as it appeareth in 46 <hi>E.</hi> 3.4. 47 <hi>E.</hi> 3.10. 20 <hi>H.</hi> 6.11. 36 <hi>H.</hi> 6.3. 3 <hi>E.</hi> 4.27. 3 <hi>H.</hi> 7.1. 14 <hi>H.</hi> 7.10 15 <hi>H.</hi> 7.16. 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dyer</hi> 50. 4 <hi>Mar.

The Eccleſiaſticall Law and the Temporal Law have ſeveral proceedings, and to ſeveral ends: the one being Temporal, to inflict puniſhment upon the body, lands, or goods; the other being Spiritual, <hi>pro ſalute Animae:</hi> the one to puniſh the outward man, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reform the inward. And this appeareth in 12 <hi>H.</hi> 7.22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10 <hi>E.</hi> 4.10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then both theſe diſtinct and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Juriſdictions conſiſt and ſtand well together, and do joyn in this, to have the whole man inwardly and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly reformed. 3. The Proviſo in the ſaid Act doth make this queſtion without queſtion, for by it is provided, ordained and enacted by the Authority aforeſaid, That all and ſingular Archbiſhops and Biſhops, and every of their Chancellors, Commiſſaries, Archdeacons, and other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries, having any peculiar Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, ſhould have full power and authority by virtue of that Act, as well to enquire in their Viſitations, Synods, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where within their Juriſdiction, as at any other time and place to take informations of all and every the things above mentioned, done, committed or perpetrated within the limits of their Juriſdictions and authority, and puniſh the ſame by Admonition, Excommunication, Sequeſtration, or Deprivation, and other Cenſures and Proceſſe, in like form as heretofore had been uſed in like caſes by the Queen's Eccleſiaſticall Laws, as by the ſaid Act appeareth. So as ſeeing, if that Act had never inflicted any puniſhment
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57830:31"/>
for depraving or not obſerving the Book of Common Prayer, yet the ſame being allowed and commanded to be obſerved for uniformity of Common Prayer, and the unity and peace of the Church; the Eccleſiaſticall Judge may deprive ſuch Parſon, Vicar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as ſhall deprave or not obſerve the ſaid Book, as well for the firſt offence, as he might have done by the Cenſures of the Church and the Eccleſiaſticall Laws, if no form of puniſhment had been inflicted by that Act. And this doth evidently appear by the ſaid Proviſo: For thereby, notwithſtanding any thing in that Act contained, they may puniſh ſuch offendors by Admonition, Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, Sequeſtration, or Deprivation, and other Cenſures and Proceſſe, in like form as heretofore hath been uſed in like caſes by the Queen's Eccleſiaſticall Laws, and are not bound to purſue the form preſcribed by the ſaid Act, which is to puniſh the offendor according to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Law.

               <hi>That the ſaid Queen had onely power by force of the ſaid Act to nominate Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, and therefore the foreſaid Nominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not purſuing the authority given unto her by that Act ſhould be void:</hi> Hereunto a threefold Anſwer was given, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by the whole Court. 1. That they which were Commiſſioners, and had places of Judicature over the King's ſubjects, ſhould be intended to be Subjects born, and not Aliens: But if in veritie they were Aliens, yet in reſpect of the general intendment to the contrary, it ought to be alledged and proved by the other party.

It was reſolved, That the ſaid Act of the firſt year of the ſaid Queen concerning Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction was not a Statute introductory of a new Law, but declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the old, which appeareth as well by the Title of the ſaid Act, <hi>videlicet, An Act reſtoring to the Crown the ancient Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction over the State Eccleſiaſtical and Spiritual, &amp;c.</hi> as alſo by the body of the Act in divers parts thereof.

Whereupon the Lords Temporal ſo demanded did anſwer every one by himſelf, That the caſes aforeſaid were clearly in derogation of the King's Crown and of his Regalty, as it was well known, and had been of long time known; and that they would ſtand with the ſame Crown and Regalty in thoſe caſes eſpecially, and in all other caſes which ſhould be attempted againſt the ſaid Crown and Regalty, in all points, with all their power. And moreover then was demanded of the Lords Spiritual there being, and the Procurators of others being abſent, their advice and will in all thoſe caſes: which Lords, that is to ſay, the Archbiſhops, Biſhops and other Prelates, being
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57830:40"/>
in the Parliament ſeverally examined, making proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that it was not their mind to deny or affirm that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> might not excommunicate Biſhops, nor that he might make Tranſlation of Prelates after the Law of Holy Church, anſwered and ſaid, That if any Executions or Proceſſes in the King's Court, as before, were made by any, and cenſures of Excommunications be made againſt any Biſhop of <hi>England,</hi> or any other of the King's liege people, for that they had made execution of ſuch commandments; and that if any executions of ſuch Tranſlations be made of any Prelats of the ſame Realm, which Prelats were very profitable and neceſſary to the King and to his ſaid Realm; or that his ſage men of his Council without his aſſent and againſt his will be withdrawn and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loigned out of the Realm, ſo that the ſubſtance and Treaſury of the Realm might be deſtroyed; that the ſame was againſt the King and his Crown, as it was contained in the Petition before named. And likewiſe the ſame Procurators, every one by himſelf examined upon the ſaid matters, did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer and ſay in the name and for their Lords as the ſaid Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops had ſaid and anſwered: And that the ſaid Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual would and ought to ſtand with the King in theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, lawfully in maintaining of his Crown, and in all other caſes touching his Crown and his Regalty, as they were bound by their Allegeance. Whereupon the King by the aſſent aforeſaid, and at the prayer of his ſaid Commons, did ordain and eſtabliſh, That if any purchaſe or purſue, or cauſe to be purchaſed or purſued, in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> or elſewhere, any ſuch Tranſlations, Proceſſes and Sentences of Excommunication, Bulls, Inſtruments, or any other things which touched the King their Lord, againſt him, his Crown and his Regalty, or his Realm, as is aforeſaid, and they which bring them within the Realm, or them receive, or make thereof notification, or any other execution, within the ſame Realm or without, that they, their notorious procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, maintainers, fautors and counſellors, ſhould be put out of the King's protection, and their lands and tenements, goods and chattels forfeit to the King, and they be attached by their

procure and obtain to themſelves, from the ſaid Biſhop of

all thoſe that would be contented to forſake their due Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

For remedy and redreſs whereof, and to prevent the great

and Offendors therein, their Procurors, Abettors and

or offences, ſhould be deemed and adjudged high Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
to the Queen and the Realm; and being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
lawfully indicted and attainted, according to the courſe of
the Laws of this Realm, ſhould ſuffer pains of death, alſo
loſe and forfeit all their Lands, Tenements, Hereditaments,
Goods and Chattels, as in caſes of high Treaſon by the Laws
of this Realm ought to be loſt and forfeited, as by the ſaid
Act appeareth.</p>
               <p>And albeit many of her ſubjects, after the ſaid Bull of <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> adhering to the Pope, did renounce their former O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Queen in reſpect of that Bull; yet all this time no Law was either made or attempted againſt them for their Recuſancy, though it were grounded upon ſo diſloyal a Cauſe. Now that theſe ſpeechleſs Bulls were declared by Act of Parliament to be ſo dangerous, then in place of them Jeſuites and <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts were ſent over, who in ſecret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners whiſpered and infuſed into the hearts of many of the unlearned ſubjects of this Realm, that the Pope had power to excommunicate and depoſe Kings and Princes; that he had excommunicated the Queen, deprived her of her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and diſcharged all her ſubjects of their Oath, Duties, and Allegeance to her; and therefore they ought not to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57830:49"/>
obey her, or any of her Commandments or Laws, under pain of the Pope's Curſe. This was high Treaſon by the ancient Laws of <hi>England:</hi> And thereupon <hi>Campion, Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> and many other <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts, being apprehended, and confeſſing that they came into <hi>England</hi> to make a party for the Catholick cauſe when need ſhould require, were in the 21. year of the ſaid Queen's Reign, by the ancient Common Laws of <hi>England,</hi> indicted, arraigned, tried, adjudged and executed for high Treaſon againſt their natural Allegeance which they ought their liege Sovereign. But all this time there was no Act of Parliament made either againſt Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, or Jeſuites, or Prieſts, her Majeſty ſtill deſiring and expecting their converſion, and that by clemency and mildneſs they might be reclaimed to their former obedience and conformity before the ſaid Bull. After Prieſts and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites were puniſhed by ſentence of Law according to their demerits: then great numbers of ſlanderous and ſeditious Books (<hi>libri falſidici</hi>) againſt her Majeſty and the State were diſperſed and ſcattered within this Realm, tending to the inciting and ſtirring of the Subjects to Inſurrection and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
               <p>Her Majeſtie in open Parliament, having with the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, mature conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſo weighty and important cauſes,<note place="margin">The Statute of an. <hi>23</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginae Eliz.</note> in the 23. year of her Reign made two ſeveral Laws. One againſt the makers and publiſhers of Seditious Books, ordaining that offence to be Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony: another againſt Recuſants, inflicting the penalty of twenty pounds the month for their Recuſancie: and yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſubmiſſion according to the Act, to be thereof freely and abſolutely diſcharged, (a milde and merciful Law, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their former Conformity, and the cauſe of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt.) But after theſe Jeſuites and <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts coming daily into and ſwarming within the Realm, inſtilling ſtill this poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon into the Subjects hearts, that by reaſon of the ſaid Bull of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> her Majeſty was excommunicated, deprived of her Kingdome, &amp; that her Subjects were diſcharged of all O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to her, and by all means endeavouring to withdraw them from their Duty and Allegeance to her Majeſty, and to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57830:50"/>
reconcile them to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>;<note place="margin">The Statute of an. <hi>27</hi> Eliz. Reginae.</note> in the 27. year of her Reign, by Authority of Parliament, her Majeſty made it Treaſon for any Jeſuite or <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſt, being her natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral-born Subject, and made a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſt or Jeſuite ſithence the beginning of her Reign, to come into any of her domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; intending thereby to keep them out of the ſame, to the end that they ſhould not infect any other Subjects with ſuch treaſonable and damnable perſwaſions and practices as are aforeſaid, which without controverſie were high Treaſon by the ancient Common Laws of <hi>England.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would ever magnanimous King of <hi>England,</hi> fithence the firſt eſtabliſhment of this Monarchy, have ſuffered any (eſpecially being his own natural-born Subjects) to live, that perſwaded his Subjects that he was no lawfull King, and practiſed with them (within the heart of this Realm) to withdraw them from their Allegeance and Loyalty to their Sovereign, the ſame being <hi>crimen laeſae Majeſtatis</hi> by the ancient Laws of this Realm.</p>
               <p>BY this and by all the Records of the Indictments it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that theſe Jeſuites and Prieſts are not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and executed for their Prieſthood and Profeſſion, but for their treaſonable and damnable Perſwaſions, and Practices againſt the Crowns and Dignities of Monarchs and abſolute Princes, who hold their Kingdoms and Dominions by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Succeſſion, and by inherent Birth-right and deſcent of inheritance, (according to the fundamental Laws of this Realm) immediately of Almighty God, and are not Tenants of their Kingdomes (as they would have it) at the will and pleaſure of any forrein Potentate whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
               <p>Now albeit the proceedings and proceſs in the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Courts be in the name of the Biſhops, &amp;c. it followeth not therefore, that either the Court is not the King's, or the Law whereby they proceed is not the King's Law. For, taking one example for many, every Leet or View of Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pledge holden by a Subject is kept in the Lord's name, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57830:50"/>
yet it is the King's Court, and all the proceedings therein are directed by the King's Laws: and many ſubjects in <hi>England</hi> have and hold Courts of Record and other Courts, and yet all their proceedings be according to the King's Laws and the Cuſtomes of the Realm.</p>
               <p>Obſerve, (good Reader) ſeeing that the determination of Hereſies, Schiſms, and Errours in Religion, Ordering, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, Admiſſion, Inſtitution and Deprivation of men of the Church, (which do concern God's true Religion and Service) of right of Matrimony, Divorces, and general Baſtardy, (whereupon depend the ſtrength of mens Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents and Inheritances) of probate of Teſtaments, and letters of Adminiſtration, (without which no debt or dutie due to any dead man can be recovered by the Common Law) Mortuaries, Penſions, Procurations, Reparations of Churches, Simony, Inceſt, Adultery, Fornication and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency, and ſome others, doth not belong to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, how neceſſary it was, for adminiſtration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, that his Majeſtie's Progenitors, Kings of this Realm, did by publick authority authorize Eccleſiaſticall Courts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, to determine thoſe great and important Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical (exempted from the Juriſdiction of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law) by the King's Laws Eccleſiaſtical. Which was done originally for two cauſes, 1. That Juſtice ſhould be adminiſtred under the Kings of this Realm with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their own Kingdome, to all their Subjects, and in all Cauſes. 2. That the Kings of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be furniſhed upon all occaſions, either forrein or domeſtical, with lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Profeſſors as well of the Eccleſiaſticall as Temporall Laws.</p>
               <p>THus hath it appeared, as well by the ancient Common Laws of this Realm, by the Reſolutions and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Judges and Sages of the Laws of <hi>England</hi> in all ſucceſſion of ages, as by Authority of many Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ancient and of latter times, That the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> is an abſolute Monarchy, and that the King is the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57830:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
onely Supreme Governour, as well over Eccleſiaſticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and in Eccleſiaſtical cauſes, as Temporal, within this Realm; to the due obſervation of which Laws both the King and the Subject are ſworn. I have herein cited the very words and texts of the Laws, Reſolutions, Judgements, and Acts of Parliament, all publick and in print, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inference, argument, or amplification; and have parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly quoted the books, years, leaves, chapters, and ſuch like certain references, as every man may at his pleaſure ſee and reade the Authorities herein cited. This Caſe is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Engliſh and Latine tongues, (as ſome other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Law have done,) to the end that my dear Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen may be acquainted with the Laws of this Realm, their own Birth-right and inheritance, and with ſuch evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences as of right belong to the ſame; aſſuring my ſelf that no wiſe or true-hearted <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> that hath been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded before he was inſtructed, will refuſe to be inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the truth, (which he may ſee with his own eyes) leſt he ſhould be diſſwaded from errour, wherewith blindfold he hath been deceived. For miſerable is his caſe, and worthy of pity, that hath been perſwaded before he was inſtructed, and now will refuſe to be inſtructed, becauſe he will not be perſwaded.</p>
